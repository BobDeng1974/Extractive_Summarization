@entity0 , the @entity3 chief secretary to the treasury , said the party would spend £ 1billion a year more on the @entity10 than @entity11 pledged earlier this week			1
the spending increase will be paid for by measures including limiting tax relief on pension pots for what the @entity3 called ‘ high earners ’			1
but experts said last night that the raid would hit thousands hoping to retire on annual pensions of £ 30,000			1
the pledge – which could affect many public sector workers – will be announced at the @entity3 conference , which gets under way in @entity26 today			2
it comes as a survey of party members found that two thirds believe fewer than 40 @entity3 mps would be elected at next may ’s general election – down from 57 at the last election			2
earlier this week , @entity11 said the conservatives would ring - fence the @entity10 budget			0
but mr @entity0 will announce that the @entity3 manifesto will promise to spend £ 1billion a year more than this			1

in addition , the @entity3 want to adjust dividend tax for additional rate taxpayers , and end the @entity47 policy of ‘ shares for rights ’ under which workers sacrifice basic employment rights in exchange for shares in the company for which they work			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ a comprehensive @entity10 paid for by the taxpayer and delivered free at the point of need was a @entity3 idea and is a central part of our vision of a stronger economy and a fairer society			1
‘ we will raise this extra money from asking the better off to contribute a little more in tax			0
this @entity3 commitment is fully and fairly funded			2
’ mr @entity0 said the @entity3 would spend £ 1billion a year more on the @entity10 than @entity11 pledged earlier this week but former treasury pensions adviser dr @entity68 said the raid on pension pots would affect those expecting annual post-retirement incomes of around £ 30,000			1
‘ these are not wealthy people – £ 30,000 a year is hardly a king ’s ransom , ’ she said			1
‘ this would make many people very upset			0
‘ a lot of people , particularly in the public sector , on good final salary schemes could be caught in the tax net			0
you should be free to make your money grow as much as possible			0
’ yesterday a @entity86 poll put the @entity3 on only 6 per cent of the vote , equalling its lowest level since the polling organisation was formed in 2000			2
the poll for @entity91 and @entity92 – carried out after the prime minister ’s promises of tax cuts at the @entity47 conference – gave his party a lead of one percentage point over @entity100			0
