@entity0 fully expects @entity1 to face @entity3 's tried and tested quality when the @entity5 pool rivals clash in @entity6 next week			1
it has been far from plain sailing for the @entity3 during their @entity10 tour preparations , a five - game schedule that starts against the @entity13 at @entity14 on saturday			1
@entity15 was dropped for the last two @entity16 against @entity17 and @entity18 after becoming embroiled in a high - profile row with @entity3 business manager @entity20 , who has since resigned			1
@entity0 says @entity1 will still be up against a quality side , despite @entity3 's well - publicised problems @entity15 was sent home from the squad during the @entity25 after a row with @entity20 former coach @entity27 resigned immediately after the narrow defeat to @entity18 this month the 25 - year - old was fined Â£ 24,640 last week after being found guilty of a serious breach of the @entity32 's code of conduct			1
coach @entity27 , meanwhile , announced his resignation immediately following @entity3 's dramatic 29 - 28 loss to @entity18 10 days ago , and he was subsequently replaced by former @entity37 and @entity38 supremo @entity36 , who will also continue to head up a successful @entity40 outfit until next year			1
wales have lost nine successive games against the @entity3 since beating them 21 - 18 in november 2008 - five of those defeats were by four points or less - and @entity0 has dismissed any notion of life becoming any easier			1
@entity3 came very close to beating the @entity18 twice this season , and will still be a threat for @entity1 @entity0 says off the field may not reflect what goes on the field and @entity3 will ' want to put a marker down ' ' in @entity36 they have a coach who has won in the northern and southern hemisphere , ' @entity1 assistant coach @entity0 said			1
' he understands a lot of the players they have got and i have no doubt they will be in a good place			2
' sometimes , off the field does n't reflect what goes on the field and they will come over knowing we are in the same @entity69 group in less than a year 's time			2
they will want to put a marker down			0
' @entity74 players have got a knack of being clinical			0
they have great skill - sets and they will be no different this autumn			1
' they play fantastic rugby and they probably should have beaten @entity18 in that last test			2
they came up short in the last 90 seconds			0
' the @entity3 are in the same group as @entity1 for next year 's @entity69 @entity18 beat their rivals in a close match last week , but @entity0 says the @entity3 ' should have won ' wales are themselves no strangers to suffering agonising late defeats against major opposition , which was most recently illustrated by a 31 - 30 loss against @entity90 in @entity91 when a late penalty try did for them			1
since @entity96 took over as @entity1 head coach for the 2008 @entity99 campaign , games against @entity90 , @entity3 and @entity18 number 25			1
the record shows one win and 24 defeats			0
wales have consistently failed to get across the finishing line - that losing sequence reveals results like 17 - 16 , 20 - 19 , 14 - 12 , 25 - 23 and 34 - 31 - but @entity0 believes the latest @entity107 should lift @entity96 's players			1
' to be 17 - 0 up against @entity90 and 13 points up with eight minutes to go , the players can take great confidence from that , ' he added			0
' that game was one we did n't deserve to lose because we played that well			0
' they are the ones that hurt you more , particularly when it 's the opportunity of beating @entity90 ( in @entity90 ) for the first time			0
' the players can take great confidence from that because we had one of the top three teams in the world on the rack			0
unfortunately , because of our composure , we did n't quite get across that line			0
' wales have won just once against the leading @entity130 nations since @entity96 took over @entity131 was part of the team that has come so close , but fallen short , repeatedly against top sides @entity1 number eight @entity131 , an integral part of @entity96 's plans during the @entity5 build - up , has started 11 tests in that losing run			2
' it is going to be a tough autumn campaign , ' @entity141 forward @entity131 said			2
' we are playing the best three sides in the world as well as @entity147 , who are not run - overs			0
we will take each game as it comes			0
' i guess to be so close and not quite get there , it has happened a few times for this squad			2
' we will learn from these experiences and hopefully when it comes around again , we will be able to win these games			0

wales face @entity3 in @entity6 next week in first november test
@entity3 have faced squad issues after @entity15 was dropped and then @entity27 resigned this month
but @entity0 *insists* @entity3 ' will be no different this autumn '
