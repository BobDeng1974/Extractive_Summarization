by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 28 march 2012 a cap on political donations could be imposed without cross-party agreement in the wake of the ‘ cash for access ’ scandal under plans being discussed by ministers			1
deputy prime minister @entity8 will lead talks starting this week aimed at forcing all three main parties to accept a donations limit			1
this would be coupled with new restrictions on spending during elections and more flexible rules on the use of existing state funding of politics			1
' significant donor ' : @entity21 and his wife @entity22 have dined with @entity25 @entity24 at @entity26			1
mr @entity27 has given the @entity28 £ 247,500 since 2008 but with all sides determined to defend their own interests , @entity30 sources say legislation for a donations cap could be introduced even if talks fail			2
the donations row has engulfed @entity37 this week after @entity28 treasurer @entity38 was caught boasting he could secure dinner invitations to the prime minister ’s homes in return for six - figure donations			2
mr @entity24 , who denies that claim , was forced to release the names of 15 @entity28 donors who had been invited to dine with him at @entity48 or @entity26 since he became prime minister			2
together they have given the @entity51 £ 25million			2
labour leader @entity52 is expected to release details of private meetings with major donors by the end of this week			0
talks : deputy prime minister @entity8 senior @entity28 believe the main parties are doomed to never - ending sleaze allegations without radical changes to party funding because of perceived conflicts of interest between donors and government policy			0
they accept they now have little option but to speed up party funding reform but insist it must apply to @entity70 ’s multi-million pound handouts from the unions			1
the @entity28 are proposing an annual limit of £ 50,000 on donations from individuals or companies , but are prepared to consider a lower threshold to secure agreement			0
conservative sources say they can not contemplate a donations cap unless @entity70 agrees that trades unions should have to require members to ‘ opt in ’ to affiliation fees going to the party			1
‘ if @entity70 wo n’t agree we should grab the initiative and push new laws through the @entity87 – and dare @entity70 to vote against them , ’ said one			1
radical proposals made late last year by sleaze watchdog the @entity90 have been rejected as politically unacceptable , since they would involve £ 100million more in taxpayers ’ money going to political parties to compensate for a £ 10,000 donations cap			0
government sources say mr @entity8 , who is in charge of party funding reform at the @entity98 , will now press for a limit to be imposed even if there is no increase in state funding to sweeten the pill			1
he , mr @entity24 and mr @entity52 have agreed to open discussions on such a move			0
it would be coupled with a new cap on spending by parties at election time to reduce the money they require , and an overhaul of the existing system of state funding			0
political parties already receive millions of pounds a year from the taxpayer , including money to fund opposition activities in the @entity119 and commons , special advisers ’ salaries , grants for policy development and cash for direct mailshots by @entity127			0
government sources say that loosening the rules on the use of existing funding streams could help persuade parties to sign up to a donations cap			0
the three main parties have each nominated two representatives to take part in the talks .			0
