by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor shadow chancellor @entity2 said the levy would be ratcheted up for the most expensive properties owners of multi-million pound homes will be hit hardest by @entity8 ’s mansion tax , @entity2 vowed today			1
the shadow chancellor insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £ 2million or more			1
but he promised to hike the levy for homes with over £ 10million , to ensure they make a ‘ significantly bigger contribution ’			2
@entity8 has joined the @entity20 in promising an extra charge on expensive properties , to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in @entity25			1
the move has been seen as an attempt by @entity8 to woo the @entity20 in the event of another hung parliament leading to a coalition with @entity32 ’s party			1
today mr @entity2 gave more detail of the scheme , but still failed to put a figure on how much the charge will be			2
writing in the @entity37 , he said : ‘ how can it be right that the foreign buyer last month of a £ 140 million flat in @entity40 will pay just £ 26 a week in council tax — the same as the average - value property in that council area ? ’ under the details announced today , the £ 2million limit will rise in line with property prices , instead of inflation ‘ to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax ’			1
@entity54 prices are up 8 per cent year - on - year , while in @entity25 prices have risen 18.7 per cent in the last 12 months			2
there will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings , but who live in an expensive home			0
this is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years			0
mr @entity2 promised a ‘ relief scheme ’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold			0
the mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties , so the wealthiest pay most			0
@entity73 , in @entity25 's @entity74 , where the average house is worth more than £ 7million the @entity20 used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £ 2million , but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement			1
@entity8 would introduce ‘ bands ’ , similar to those used for council tax , with a higher charge on the biggest houses			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the tax must be progressive so that those with properties worth tens of millions of pounds make a significantly bigger contribution than those in houses just above the limit			2
‘ but it must also be administratively simple			0
the original proposal by the @entity20 for a one per cent annual charge on the value of the house above £ 2 million would require detailed valuations each year and fails that test			1
‘ i believe a better way would be to use a banded system , which avoids the need for detailed annual valuations			0
’ it could be modelled on a banded system introduced by the coalition government o target properties bought through companies to reduce tax			0
it groups homes together in bands : £ 2 - £ 5 million , £ 5 - 10 million , £ 10 - 20 million and over £ 20 million .			0

shadow chancellor promises to ratchet up charge on highest value houses
promises to protect ' cash poor ' families living in *costly* properties
@entity124 will kick in at £ 2million and rise in line with average house prices
plans follow @entity20 policy to impose charge on mansions
