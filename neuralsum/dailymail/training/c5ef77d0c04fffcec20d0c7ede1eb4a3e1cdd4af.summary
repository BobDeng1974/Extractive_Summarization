a group of students unearthed a 7,000 - year - old mummy belonging to the great @entity32 predecessor - @entity30 culture - during a trip to northern @entity6 trip organizer @entity34 said the discovery of the mummy , part of the @entity30 culture , showed that the area should be declared a protected zone			1
to the @entity30 , deliberate preservation of their dead by means of mummification appears to have been a deeply religious act â€” a study in devotion			2
they likely believed that mummies were the bridge between the world of the living and the supernatural realm of the dead			0
what makes the @entity30 so remarkable is the elaborate way in which they prepared their loved ones for the hereafter			0
' chinchorro mummies are one of the wonders of @entity65 archaeology and of mortuary studies anywhere in the world , ' exclaims @entity68 of the @entity69 of @entity70 , who is excavating a cemetery at @entity73 , @entity74			0
what makes it all different from the @entity30 culture is the fact that ancient @entity78 saw exclusively kings and queens worth of mummification , unlike in @entity74			1
surprisingly , the @entity30 community accorded everyone , regardless of age or status , this sacred rite , deeply honoring the dead and death as such			0
the @entity92 area represents the bedrock of the @entity30 culture , then the cemetery at @entity90 is its mother lode : no other site in the region has yielded a larger or better preserved collection of artificial mummies so far			1
the practice came along by far earlier than that of the ancient @entity32 - 6,000 years before , to be exact			0
@entity30 culture culminating from 7020 bc to 1500 @entity102 consists of fishermen villages scattered along the coast of @entity106 desert , from @entity73 in @entity74 in the north to @entity108 in the south .			2

unlike the @entity78 , the @entity30 *people* mummified everyone , not just kings and queens
