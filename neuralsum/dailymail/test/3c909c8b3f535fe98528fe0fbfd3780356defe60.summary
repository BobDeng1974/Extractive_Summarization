@entity1 's @entity0 - young spectacularly eagled the par - five 18th to surge into a two - shot lead in the second round of the @entity4 on friday as @entity6 's record - equalling run came to an end			1
the 22 - year - old @entity0 , who won her maiden @entity9 title at the @entity10 in february , struck a superb second shot to six feet on her final hole and knocked in the putt to card a seven - under - par 65 at @entity14			1
that left the @entity16 at seven - under 137 in the first women 's major of the season , two ahead of overnight leader @entity19 , who followed her opening 67 with a 72			2
@entity6 looks for her ball in the water on the 18th hole during the second round long - hitting @entity26 @entity25 , the 2009 champion at @entity27 , fired a 68 to finish at four under , level with @entity29 ( 69 ) and @entity31 's @entity30 ( 69 )			1
@entity0 , who had returned a 72 in the first round , birdied four of her first nine holes to claw her way up the leaderboard			1
she picked up further shots at the 11th and 15th before making her only bogey of the day at the 16th , then ended her round in eagle style			2
' i really hit the ball good and putted really good , ' said @entity0 , who is playing in only her third major championship			2
' i 'm very happy			0
' yesterday i adjust a little bit my putting ... now i see the line better			0
' @entity44 missed out on recording her 30th successive under - par round @entity19 , who at 18 became the youngest winner of a women 's major at the @entity49 held at @entity27 , was a frustrated figure after shooting a level - par 72			1
' i had to fight a little bit harder today , ' said the 26 - year - old @entity26			0
' my swing was n't quite as sharp as it was yesterday			0
i made some sloppy bogeys and some really good pars			0
but i give myself a chance for the weekend			0
' @entity44 's record - equalling run of 29 consecutive rounds under par on the @entity9 came to end when the world no 1 bogeyed two of her last four holes for a 73 and a level - par total of 144			1
the 17 - year - old , who has already won six @entity9 titles , had a chance to dip under par after hitting a perfect tee shot down the 18th but her attempt to lay up with a six - iron failed as her ball ran through the fairway into a pond in front of the green			2
@entity0 of @entity1 has a two - shot lead at the halfway point penalised a stroke , she hit her fourth shot to 12 feet above the hole from where she two - putted for a bogey six			1
' it was 169 ( yards ) to the end of the fairway and it was still 20 yards after that with the rough so i thought a six - iron would be okay , even it flew out of there , ' @entity44 told @entity89			1
' obviously it was n't the right club			0
i would love to have had a birdie opportunity there			0
' however , @entity44 was happy enough to have matched hall of famer @entity95 's record run of 29 consecutive sub-par rounds			1
' you just go out there , try and have fun , try to shoot the lowest you can , ' said the pony - tailed @entity101			0
' now it 's over but 29 is not too bad			0

@entity6 is seven shots behind leader @entity0 - young
@entity44 had been aiming for a 30th consecutive under - par round
but the world no 1 could only finish on one - over par
