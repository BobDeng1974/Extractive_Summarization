the river of flames that has been making its way downslope on @entity4 's big island since june 27 is speeding up as it heads straight for a town of 1000 residents			1
the continued lava flow from the summer crater eruption at @entity9 was last clocked at a steady 705 feet per @entity10 the progress has been measured at a far brisker 890 feet per day			1
while the flow has now bypassed @entity14 homestead , directly in its currently path is the town of @entity17			1

' heading straight for town : the river of flames that has been making its way downslope on @entity4 's big island since june 27 is speeding up as it heads straight for a town of 1000 residents speeding up : moving at its current speed , scientists said the 300 - foot - wide flow could reach @entity35 in close to two weeks that could , however , change at any moment			1
thankfully , due no doubt to the wet and dense vegetation ' there is no brushfire threat at this time and all burning is limited to the vegetation that is in direct contact with the flow			0
' as of tuesday , experts estimated that the flow was 19 days away from the main drag of @entity17			1
however , that was at the previously measured speed			0
now the lava could hit the town in closer to 15 days			0
residents and lawmakers fear that , beyond the main town road , the thick molten rock could reach @entity59 , which could cut off virtually all access to and from @entity4 's @entity61 , notes the @entity62			1

but scientists said surround forest was not burning residents and lawmakers fear that , beyond the main town road , the thick molten rock could reach @entity59 , which could cut off virtually all access to and from @entity4 's @entity61 , notes the @entity62 unpredictability is a problem : the flow emerged june 27 , but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late august , with several disappearances and re-emergences since then unpredictability is a problem : the flow emerged june 27 , but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late august , with several disappearances and re-emergences since then			1
the direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it			0
@entity4 civil defense director @entity95 said lava has covered other major @entity4 roads in the past , like a state highway in @entity99 and @entity100 which is partially in @entity101			0

ghost town : @entity17 , @entity4			2
surf shop co-owner @entity106 said there ís a threat @entity109 could become a ghost town if lava from @entity113 volcano crosses roads connecting the village with the rest of the @entity4			2

@entity118 last measured the @entity61 lava flow at 705 feet / day . it has progressed *350* yards since tuesday
the flow , which stems from the june 27 crater eruption at @entity9 , has bypassed @entity124 on the @entity4
the fiery flow is now heading directly toward the main drag in the town of @entity17
