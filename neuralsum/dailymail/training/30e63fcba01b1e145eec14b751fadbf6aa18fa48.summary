bones belonging to a giant penguin that existed 37 to 40 million years ago have been unearthed by palaeontologists			1
the latest findings have enabled researchers to conclude that the so - called ' colossus penguin ' was bigger than any penguin that came before or after it			2
the species known as @entity9 measured a staggering 6.63 feet ( 2.02 metres ) from the tip of its beak to its toes , making it bigger even than the modern emperor penguin			1
bones belonging to an extinct giant penguin have been found in @entity18			1
they suggest a species existed that was once up to 6.63ft ( 2.02m ) in length			1
pictured are various views of the humerus ( a to @entity27 ) and tarsometatarsus ( @entity28 ) that were found , the latter of which was used to measure its size the find was made at @entity31 , part of a chain of islands off the @entity18 peninsula			2
researchers , led by dr @entity37 from the @entity38 , collected , categorised , and acoustically analysed hundreds of audio and video vocal recordings from penguins			0
all were taken from a captive colony of 48 @entity45 penguins at the @entity47 zoo in @entity48 , @entity49			0
this group was made up of 15 males , 17 females , eight juveniles aged between three and 12 months , and eight nesting chicks			0
the results revealed that all the penguins have four essential vocalisations : a contact call emitted by isolated birds , an agonistic call used to signal aggression , an ecstatic display song uttered by single birds during the breeding season , and a mutual display song made by pairs at their nests			0
the authors also identified two distinct vocalisations interpreted as begging calls by chicks , in the form of a begging ‘ peep ’ , and a begging moan			0
according to dr @entity76 of the @entity77 in @entity78 this region was much warmer 37 to 40 million years ago			1
it was ‘ a wonderful time for penguins , when 10 to 14 species lived together along the @entity18 coast , ’ she told @entity83			0
dr @entity76 found the most complete skeleton of the colossus penguin earlier this year , but these latest finds include part of a wing , the humerus , and the joint between the ankle and foot bone , known as the tarsometatarsus			2
although the humerus can not be used to make estimates of a penguin ’s size and mass , the tarsometatarsus is usable in this regard			0
at 3.6 inches ( 9.1 centimetres ) in length , this tarsometatarsus set a record for penguins and led dr @entity76 to conclude that the penguin stood 5.25 feet ( 1.6 metres ) tall from head to toe - and 6.63 feet ( 2.02 metres ) tall if its beak was extended upwards			1
this makes it larger than any penguin known to exist , even the emperor penguin that exists today			2
at 3.6 inches ( 9.1 centimetres ) in length , this tarsometatarsus set a record for penguins and led dr @entity76 to conclude that the penguin stood 5.25 feet ( 1.6 metres ) tall from head to toe			1
shown is a size comparison to an average adult male and three species of penguin alive today the find was made on a chain of islands off the tip of the @entity18 peninsula known as @entity31 the species is known as @entity9 , dubbed the ' colossus penguin ' is the largest penguin , living or dead , to have ever been found , bigger even than the emperor penguin ( left )			1
on the right , this pigeon skeleton illustration shows at number 8 where the left and right tarsometatarsus are found on birds the skeletal data also indicates the colossus penguin would have weighed more than 115 kilograms ( 250 pounds ) - more than twice the weight of an average emperor penguin			1
its huge size also meant it was probably able to stay underwater for at least 40 minutes			2
‘ according to estimates , the tarsometatarsus would belong to the largest and most massive penguin described so far , ’ the researchers write in their paper			0
‘ this bird was probably a piscivorous [ fish - eating ] penguin , with high diving ability for catching prey			0
’ this illustration shows what palaeeudyptes klekowskii might have looked like			0
the skeletal data indicates the colossus penguin would have weighed more than 115 kilograms ( 250 pounds ) - more than twice the weight of an average emperor penguin alive today			1

bones belonging to an extinct giant penguin have been found in @entity18
they suggest a species existed that was once up to 6.63ft ( 2.02m ) in length
that *'s* a measure from the tip of its beak to the its toes - its regular height would be 5.25 feet ( 1.6 metres )
the species is known as @entity9 , dubbed the ' colossus penguin ' , and existed 37 to 40 million years ago when the region was warmer
it is the largest penguin , living or dead , to have ever been found - bigger even than the modern emperor penguin
and it was so big it could survive underwater for more than 40 minutes
