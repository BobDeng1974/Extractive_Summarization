by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:34 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 18:35 est , 22 august 2012 @entity2 said rules which allow expats abroad to claim up to £ 100m in winter fuel payments was ' ridiculous ' @entity2 last night vowed to fight a ‘ ludicrous ’ @entity7 ruling allowing expats living in warm countries to claim a total of up to £ 100million in winter fuel payments			1
the @entity12 ruling means the government must pay the annual handout worth as much as £ 300 to up to 444,000 @entity16 pensioners living abroad			1
the @entity17 is now considering bringing in a ‘ temperature ’ test so payments would only be made to those living in colder climates			1
mr @entity2 told the @entity23 : ‘ we will fight these ridiculous rules			0
the winter fuel payment is about helping @entity16 pensioners with heating costs and it is ludicrous we could have to pay more pensioners living in hot countries			1
’ he added : ‘ we will protect taxpayers ’ money and bring in a temperature criteria			2
’ previously , the elderly could only qualify for the winter fuel allowance if they reached 60 before leaving @entity16			1
anyone who left @entity16 before the payment was introduced in 1998 was also excluded			2
but under the new rules claimants only need to ‘ have a genuine and sufficient link with the @entity16 ’ including having ‘ lived or worked in the @entity16 for most of your working life ’			2
it means that anyone born on or before july 5 , 1951 , can now make a claim for the payment for winter fuel this year			1
any household with a pensioner qualifies for a payment of £ 200			0
those with someone over 80 get £ 300			0
in the 2010 - 11 winter , 72,840 expats claimed winter fuel payments , or @entity56 , at a total cost of almost £ 16million			1
under the changed rules , that figure could be multiplied many times over			0
there are some 444,000 people living in @entity7 who receive a @entity16 state pension			2
bills to heat the home : mr @entity2 said the winter fuel payment is about helping @entity16 pensioners with heating costs if they were to all claim the @entity56 , the annual cost would rocket to almost £ 100million a year , at a time when the government is being forced to make unprecedented spending cuts			1
it is not possible to accurately estimate how many people will receive a payment for the first time as a result of this change , mr @entity2 said , because not all will satisfy the criteria for a @entity56			0
officials are now looking into how a temperature test might work			1
any change in the @entity56 criteria would require new legislation			0
there are some 60,000 @entity89 living in @entity90 , many of them based in the south where the average temperature in winter can be as high as @entity95 ( @entity94 )			2
sleeping in hotter climates : a ¿ temperature ¿ test could be brought in so payments would only be made to those living in colder climates in parts of @entity103 , where there are some 100,000 @entity16 oaps , average temperatures in december and january can reach @entity107 ( @entity108 )			1
many of the expatriates who have moved to such countries are middle - class retired people who have deliberately moved abroad to enjoy a better climate			0
for elderly people solely surviving on a state pension or small employment pensions the @entity56 is a lifeline during particularly cold winters			0
some £ 100billion is spent providing benefits for the elderly , and mr @entity2 has called for £ 5billion to be shaved off that total			0
the @entity122 said : ‘ it is now possible people living in the @entity125 and @entity126 may be entitled to @entity127			0

' temperature ' test may be brought in to check climate cold enough
winter fuel payment about helping @entity16 pensioners , says @entity17
