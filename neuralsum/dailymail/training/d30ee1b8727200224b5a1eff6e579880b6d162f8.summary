he thought he had done it , last kick of the game			0
@entity4 saw the opening on the right and let fly , @entity7 , in @entity9 ’s goal flung himself acrobatically to save			1
@entity4 scrambled to secure the loose ball in vain , referee @entity10 blew the final whistle			1
what a homecoming it might have been , what a finale			0
instead , in his native wales on tuesday night , @entity4 had to settle for a win , the first trophy of @entity21 ’s season and not the crowning glory he and the locals surely craved			1

referee : @entity10 ( @entity80 ) attendance : 31,000 still , he will no doubt have reflected as he collected his medal , smiling broadly and posing with his superstar team - mates beneath a triumphant arch declaring them @entity26 winners , it could be worse			1
not every wish can come true for a @entity39 ; just most of them			0
so it was that @entity37 stole the show in @entity34			1
@entity4 ’s show , @entity50 ’s show , @entity49 ’s show			1
the new wave had to bow down to the master			0
but those who turned out to see the @entity96 , as much as the local hero , will not have gone home disappointed			0
@entity37 cut a forlorn figure in @entity100 this summer			1
injured , shorn of his more talented club - mates , his @entity102 team failed to make it out of their group and the talisman appeared pitiably morose			2
this occasion could not have been more different			0
his two goals were well taken , the second a peach , and he looked fit , re-energised , every inch the planet ’s finest footballer			0
old times : @entity37 ( left ) embraces with his former @entity116 boss sir @entity115 ( right ) after collecting his winners medal from the presentation ceremony in the stands nearby stealing in : @entity37 meets @entity4 's cross at the far post to give @entity21 the lead trademark : @entity37 performs his famous celebration after his opening goal homecoming : @entity4 created the first goal on his return to @entity34 proud @entity127 : @entity4 shows off the @entity129 flag on the pitch as @entity21 players celebrated victory thumbs up from us : @entity37 lays alongside @entity4 next to the @entity26 trophy as @entity52 ( centre ) looks on however impressive his companions , it is @entity37 who encapsulates the brilliance of the @entity141 champions , his daring , his audacity , his vision			1
@entity34 was privileged to have him for the night ; as any city would be			0
his two goals here took his total against @entity9 to 18 in four years			0
it is a typical @entity37 trait that some of his numbers induce gasps			1
the majority of forwards would be happy with that return in one season ; he has achieved it against one club			2
yet @entity37 ’s magnificence should not detract from @entity4 ’s contribution			1
he certainly did not have a poor game and his cross for @entity37 ’s opener was arguably the pass of the night			1
with all eyes on the new boys , it was last season ’s partnership that combined to break the stalemate with a stunning counter-attack fully showcasing the incredible threat posed by @entity21 on the break			1
watching on : @entity176 - winning midfielder @entity175 was in the stands to witness his team - mates ' victory @entity9 lost the ball 70 yards from their own net but , in the blink of an eye , that is where it had been relocated , a quite superb left - wing cross by @entity4 finding @entity37 at the far post for a simple , if impressively clinical , finish			1
switching ably between flanks and through the middle , @entity4 ’s supply line was inch - perfect			1
less grand than the @entity194 , this was nonetheless a fitting stage for his talents			0
born and raised in this city — @entity198 spotted him as a nine - year - old playing for @entity199 and , at 16 , he was still helping his school win trophies locally — what a player he has grown up to be			2
he looks entirely at home in this company , no matter the continued raising of the stakes			0
drawing a line in the turf : @entity211 referee @entity10 uses his vanishing spray to mark a free - kick collision course : @entity21 defender @entity46 goes head over heels will it work , this team of all the talents ? it presents no easy challenge for coach @entity222			1
@entity21 ’s squad is like a big family now , with all the kids constantly fighting for attention			1
so @entity50 had a fine second - half shot saved by @entity7 and @entity54 had a couple go close			2
@entity229 — who may just have been @entity21 ’s most consistent player over the course of last season — could n’t even get in the starting line - up			1
as for @entity4 , he had a couple of first - half shots deflect wide and forced an 18th - minute save from @entity7 : close but no cigar			1
perhaps he was just trying too hard			0
quiet night : @entity236 ( centre ) did not perform at the level he did for @entity239 during the @entity176 heads up : @entity9 players crowd around @entity21 's @entity45 trying to challenge for a header he took a free - kick which did not make it over the wall and could not get on the end of any crosses , despite a number of a good penalty area runs			1
nor was he greatly helped by his re-acquaintance with @entity250			0
when @entity4 was fouled quite blatantly early in the game , @entity250 waved play on , perhaps leaning too heavily on memory and accusations of diving			2
they tend to take @entity4 only on face value in @entity257 and he fits right in			2
@entity37 is another who is more sinned against than sinning			2
preparing for one of his lightning stepovers in the first half , he was taken out quite brutally by @entity9 ’s @entity70 , whose response was almost comical in its crudeness			0
the second goal , which effectively ended the contest , was a perfect riposte four minutes after half time			2
close support : @entity4 's girlfriend @entity267 watches on from the stands inside the ground if at first you do n't succeed : @entity4 kept trying but his performance did not match @entity37 's @entity37 started the move on the halfway line and finished it , seizing a square pass from @entity54 to strike a left - foot shot that eluded @entity7			1
maybe the @entity9 goalkeeper should have done better , but @entity37 ’s effect on the ball has a way of bamboozling even the safest of hands			2
there are a number of useful teams around now , but few possess a forward line capable of the wonder of @entity21			2
when @entity222 named a front six of @entity37 , @entity4 , @entity50 , @entity49 , @entity52 and @entity54 , it was a statement of intent , a bold return to the days of the @entity39 when the club attempted to dominate @entity293 with an xi that read like a spectacularly overambitious fantasy team			1
on the computer screen the group does not have to gel , blend or strike that delicate balance between attacking genius and defensive resilience			0
@entity302 and @entity303 were always a wonderful pairing , if matched by keyboard or console			0
centre stage : there was no doubt who the man of the match was at the end of the game @entity49 control : the @entity317 midfielder was at his controlling best in his competitive @entity21 debut real football is n’t like that , except @entity21 ’s football is			1
there is no equivalent of @entity324 in this team , no deep midfield destroyer			0
@entity222 ’s forwards have to run hard and @entity52 and @entity49 have to put in their tackles			2
it should n’t work , it may not work long term — but last night it did , just about			0
this was one of those occasions when @entity21 gave their opponents so much to deal with that the odd defensive lapse could be overlooked			2
beating the very best teams , certainly in the late stages of the @entity338 , may require a plan @entity340 yet in @entity34 , @entity21 just kept coming at @entity9 until the defences broke			1
it was nevertheless a bold first - half performance by the @entity344 champions and @entity32 made more first - half saves than his counterpart @entity7			2
sparkle : confetti is released into the air as @entity32 lifts the @entity26 name on the trophy : @entity52 , @entity48 and @entity4 point to show the list of names on the @entity26 spurred on : former @entity356 stars @entity4 and @entity52 pose alongside the @entity26 but it always seemed a matter of when , not if , @entity21 would score and that moment arrived bang on the half - hour			1
this is a team that can not , as yet , find room for @entity175 , @entity59 or @entity363			0
maybe one day they will abandon all semblance of logic and just send out the 11 best players in the world			0
if they bought @entity371 they could even take a swing at rush goalie			0
do n’t put it past them			0
it is fair to say they do things differently over there , even if @entity37 ’s influence remains as reliable as @entity382 sunrise			2
taking the applause : @entity37 was the star man for @entity21 as they defeated @entity9 2 - 0 all together now : the @entity21 stars celebrate @entity37 's opener as one			1

@entity21 fielded football 's most *expensive* ever xi in @entity26
@entity37 put @entity338 winners 1 - 0 up after 30 minutes
@entity393 winner added a second goal in the 49th minute
@entity4 wins @entity26 on his return to @entity397
