it says : ' @entity107 has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by failing to ensure the safety of children at the school ; delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education ; discriminating in its policies and procedures towards female staff ; and failing to discharge its duties and responsibilities in respect of the governing body			0
' i will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement			0
' the letter , addressed to @entity127 , chairwoman of governors at @entity129 also sets out other action that the school must take in the next few weeks , including satisfying the government that its curriculum is ' broad and balanced ' and that it is welcoming to children of all faiths and none			2
