to most , a shop is just a shop			2
but perhaps we are overlooking the wonder of urban temples			0
meticulously curated or a complete shambles , each store is a unique treasure trove of goods			0
he is one of 250 guardians visited by the @entity32 - based photographer for the series since 2012 squeaky clean ? one of the more ordered shops is this meticulous adult book shop in @entity37 run by @entity38			1
like all the photos , this is the only shot @entity22 took and for the shopkeeper , it is home			2
in this incredible series of photographs , store owners - or temple guardians - across the globe give an insight into their world			2
hardware shops , thrift stores , newsagents , mechanics and adult book stores all betray their own distinctive wonder			1
the project , by @entity32 - based photographer @entity22 , has been ongoing since 2012			1
shrine : @entity61 - haired @entity60 is a stoic figure in the middle of her clustered religious memorabilia , including a giant statue of @entity66 under the counter in @entity32 , @entity68 @entity69 : @entity70 is surrounded by hundreds of products in his thrift store in @entity32			1
it is the epitome of the temples @entity22 describes as ' magical and overloaded ' my life : @entity77 says her super-organised fabric shop in @entity32 , @entity68 , keeps her busy and gives her something to always be thinking about part - time : this antiques shop in @entity37 is @entity83 's day job , where he likes to relax with his dog			1
on the weekends , he takes part in medieval battle reenactments @entity22 spends days with each ' guardian ' , getting to know how they run their life and their shop			1
then , he captures the shot			0
he said : ' i 'm interested in the relationship between the environment and the attitude of the @entity97 , how they position themselves in space			0
' i become the director of their universe			0
i show them their day to day life through my eye and my camera			0
' change of course : the @entity109 in @entity12 worked on @entity110 until he was 35 , building up a fortune			2
he then packed it in to open @entity113 cruising along : @entity115 's mechanical store in @entity116 is doing well as the motoring industry thrives in the @entity118 take two : @entity121 , pictured in her sweet shop in @entity24 , was forced to rebuild her intricate little world after a gas explosion in the basement downstairs wired up : @entity22 spent a while becoming accustomed to @entity127 's entangled world in this basement electrical store in @entity12 under threat : @entity130 is dwarfed by her vintage magazine stacks at her store in @entity24 , which - like many independent shops - was forced to close last year more than just a shoe shop ? @entity137 , in his place in @entity24 , is technically a shoe repairman			1
but you would n't guess it from the piles of books and globes and just one shoe a temple for the community : @entity147 uses his bookshop in @entity32 , @entity68 , as a centre for local people to read but also to spend time off the streets throwback : soon , stores will become relics in themselves - even this one run by @entity157 in @entity32 which revels in vintage items from the last century he added : ' these places are sometimes magical , overloaded with elements , colours and stories , guarded by these characters who are sometimes touching , funny , quirky , and at times frightening			1
people pay less and less attention to their environment			0
' they are always in a hurry , they do n’t take the time to spend time with one another			0
' unfortunately , these places will one day no longer be around			0
this is one of the reasons that compelled me to want to document these ‘ guardians ’			0
so far , i ’ve visited nine cities - @entity32 , @entity12 , @entity179 , @entity24 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity37 , @entity182 , @entity183 - and met nearly 250 @entity97			1

photographer @entity22 , from @entity32 , @entity68 , has been photographing shopkeepers since 2012
he spends days with each ' guardian ' of every ' urban temple ' across the world before *settling* on the perfect shot
stores include adult book shop in @entity37 , hardware store in @entity116 , newsagent in @entity12 , butcher in @entity24
