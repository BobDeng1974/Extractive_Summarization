@entity0 is still in the dark over the reasons for his sudden departure from @entity4 but insists he holds no grudges against his old club as he prepares to kick - start his career with @entity8			1
the 34 - year - old @entity10 prop forward was looking forward to starting his 10th season with the @entity4 when he was told in november that his chances of regular football in 2015 were going to be limited			1
it left him with little time to find a new club but the @entity8 offered him a 12 - month deal and he followed a well - trodden path from @entity19 to @entity20			1
@entity4 's @entity0 is tackled by @entity22 ' @entity21 and @entity23 during a @entity25 match at the @entity26 , @entity22			1
' i had a conversation in the middle of last season when i was definitely staying for this year but at the end of the year that changed , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm not too sure why			2
' i think it 's because they 're bringing on the younger players			0
they 've got to look to the future			0
i 've got no bitter feelings towards them , other than perhaps it was n't ideal timing for me because most clubs were settled by the time i got to find out			0
' as it happens , @entity8 is good for me			2
i do n't have to uproot myself and i know a few of the guys here			0
' back rower @entity47 had been given the same message a few months earlier and front rower @entity49 was similarly told he was not part of @entity4 coach @entity53 's plans for 2015			1
they moved on to @entity55 ( on a season - long loan ) and @entity57 respectively and @entity0 anticipated an influx of new blood to replenish the @entity4 ' pack			1
however , @entity4 ' only close - season signing has been @entity63 prop @entity62 , which has surprised @entity0			1
' if it had been my choice , i would have stayed there until the bitter end but they said i would have limited opportunities so it was time to move on , ' he added			2
' me and @entity70 ( @entity49 ) got told at the same time			2
i was a little bit surprised			0
i assumed they would be signing some other people			0
that has not happened yet but ( chief executive ) @entity74 ( @entity75 ) has probably got something in his back pocket			0
' @entity22 ' @entity79 is tackled by @entity4 ' @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity0 during the @entity83 match at the @entity19 , @entity4 @entity0 , who played for the @entity8 in the @entity84 friendly at @entity4 , still expects the @entity4 to be challenging for honours this year			1
' i imagine they will do really well , ' he said			0
' i 've got some great friends there and they 've been doing some good stuff in training			0
i imagine they will be challenging at the top end of the top eight but i will just concentrate on what we 're doing			0
' @entity8 are the bookmakers favourites to finish bottom but @entity0 believes they can once more defy the pundits			1
' the squad is looking good for this year , ' he said			2
' they 've got @entity102 back , who is a great half - back and actually pretty different to what i 've played with before			2
' he 's pretty organised and he will help me because he tells you where you need to be on the pitch			0
coming to a new team with new systems it helps me massively			0
' @entity0 and fellow newcomer @entity110 are still recovering from groin strains and will sit out @entity8 's game against @entity57 for @entity114 's testimonial on sunday .			1
