@entity0 bought themselves time with their win against @entity2 to ponder whether they have the best batting combination to make a @entity5 impact			1
the protracted nature of this tournament means @entity0 , with one match in the next 14 days , can carefully consider if they should finally let @entity9 loose when they meet @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity0 on tuesday returned to @entity11 , scene of their criminal defeat by @entity14 , where the immediate @entity5 future of @entity16 will be very much at the top of their agenda in the coming days			1
@entity9 - who has yet to appear at this @entity5 - hits out during training in @entity11 last week the brilliance of @entity22 in the 119 - run win over the @entity24 papered over the cracks in the @entity0 batting line - up that were epitomised by @entity27			1
@entity0 ’s decision to bring @entity27 in at the last minute ahead of their @entity5 opener against @entity30 has yet to be justified , with the @entity31 looking out of form in scoring 10 in each of the three matches			2
that means @entity0 must decide whether they should resist more changes and give @entity27 another chance to show he can be as effective in one - day cricket as he was in the test game last summer or introduce the dynamism of @entity9			2
@entity16 trudges off after another poor innings comes to an end against @entity2 @entity22 has been @entity0 's standout batsman so far after his hundred against @entity2 hales in an intriguing one			0
his @entity47 form appeared to guarantee a proper chance in 50 - over cricket but @entity50 exposed limitations in his technique last summer that led to @entity0 preferring @entity22 at the top of the order			0
there have also been concerns about his discipline and attitude but @entity59 , the @entity0 batting coach , made a point of praising @entity9 ' maturity when he said last week that the @entity64 batsman was ‘ knocking hard on the door			0
’ the question is , if @entity0 do not trust @entity9 enough to give him a chance now , presumably at three with @entity68 continuing at six , then there is little point in him being here and they should have brought a different spare batsman			0
@entity9 watches on from behind the stumps as @entity27 lets fly during training in @entity11 @entity0 could , of course , go back to @entity75 and give themselves an extra bowling option too but they seem to have lost all faith in his bowling while believing his batting in the tri-series did not warrant a place here now			0
it seemed illogical for @entity0 to change a settled line - up at the 11th hour before this @entity5 but , three games in , they need to have a good hard look at @entity9 in the nets over the next four days and not be afraid to make a switch again .			2

@entity0 have lost two of their opening three @entity5 matches
@entity16 came in to the team late but has *struggled* at @entity95
*powerful* opener @entity9 could be given chance against @entity10
