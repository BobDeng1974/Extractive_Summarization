regular exercise may keep @entity1 ’s at bay – even in those whose genes put them in the dementia danger zone			0
a study of men and women in their 60s , 70s and 80s found that being active at least three times a week stopped the brain from shrinking			1
strikingly , even those with a common gene called apoe - e4 were protected by brisk walking , jogging , swimming and cycling			1
strenuous household chores also helped			2
a study of men and women in their 60s , 70s and 80s found that being active at least three times a week stopped the brain from shrinking potentially helping keep @entity1 's at bay ( posed by model ) the brain normally shrinks with age , and the hippocampus , the brain ’s memory hub is particularly vulnerable in those at genetic risk of dementia			1
@entity36 , an expert in the ageing brain , said : ‘ this is the first study look at how physical activity might impact the loss of hippocampal volume in people at genetic risk for @entity1 ’s disease			1
‘ there are no other treatments shown to preserve hippocampal volume in those that may develop alzheimer ’s disease			0
‘ this study has tremendous implications for how we might intervene , prior to the development of any dementia symptoms , in older adults who are at increased genetic risk for @entity1 ’s disease			2
the @entity58 - e4 gene is carried by up to 30 per cent of the population			0
it increases the risk of @entity1 ’s in old age but not everyone with the suspect dna will develop the disease			0
the latest finding suggests the exercise may be one of the factors that decides if a brain is able to overcome its genetic inheritance			2
the @entity73 researchers measured the brain size of four groups of pensioners at the start and end of the 18 - month study			1
the study found that even those with a common @entity1 's gene called apoe - e4 were protected by brisk walking , jogging , swimming and cycling the amount of exercise they did was monitored and they were tested for the @entity58 - e4 gene			1
the only brain shrinkage occurred in those with the gene who did little or no exercise			2
those with the gene who were at least moderately physically active three times a week or more were protected , the journal frontiers in aging neuroscience reports			1
researcher dr @entity101 , of the @entity102 , said : ‘ we found that physical activity has the potential to preserve the volume of the hippocampus in those with increased risk for @entity1 ’s disease , which means we can possibly delay cognitive decline and the onset of dementia symptoms in these individuals			1
‘ physical activity interventions may be especially potent and important for this group			2
’ he added that future research is needed to work out how exercise and genetics interact to lower the risk of @entity1 ’s			0
and that more evidence could lead to those with a family history of the disease being ‘ prescribed ’ exercise			0
dr @entity101 said : ‘ we do not yet have the level of exercise needed to justify this approach specifically for @entity1 ’s prevention but exercise certainly can not harm , so should be prescribed regardless			0
’ @entity1 ’s and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 @entity137 and the number is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages			0
@entity58 - @entity141 raises the risk of the disease up to ten-fold and up to 40 per cent of people who develop @entity1 ’s in old have the gene .			0

study found being active at least three times a week stops brain shrinking
experts *recommend* swimming , jogging , cycling and even *mundane* chores
@entity73 researchers measured brain activity in pensioners over 18 months
