nerves in a @entity2 quarter final can get the better of any side - but @entity4 are lucky that they had the best player left in the competition to calm theirs			2
it took their talismanic forward just eight minutes to open up @entity11 and help to swing this tight tie in the @entity14 ' favour			0
even his stoppage time one - on - one miss could not ruin the celebrations			1
@entity19 and co have conceded just two goals at this @entity2 - an @entity23 penalty and a @entity25 consolation goal - but @entity26 made a mockery of them with some fancy footwork to start the move for @entity32 's opener			1
39 minutes : big chance for @entity4 as @entity26 escapes @entity54 and plays it to @entity35 who is fouled			2
40 minutes : @entity26 takes the free kick and opts for power but it goes over the bar			1
48 minutes : @entity4 's talisman lofts a pass to the back post but it is overhit			0
94 minutes : @entity26 is put through on goal on the counter as @entity11 throw men forward but he sticks his shot straight at @entity66			2
with his back to goal , @entity4 's captain twisted and turned , left then right , and quickly escaped the attentions of @entity35 and @entity36 before slipping the ball to @entity51			0
from there , the ball reached @entity32 who brilliantly volleyed in on the turn			0
and that was all it took - 1 - 0 and it looked so simple for @entity26 , leaving players from one of the @entity2 's best defensive sides looking like statues			1
it was a tough afternoon for the creative players : @entity41 came off injured in the first half and @entity85 saw himself subbed as @entity11 searched for an equaliser , but @entity26 still made the difference			2
he had a quiet second period but then so did most			0
and he still managed to be key for his country , dropping deeper into midfield where he completed 86.4 % of his 22 passes			0
marked man : @entity35 and @entity54 do their best to stop the tournament 's best player mercurial : the @entity39 throw themselves at the ball but they ca n't stop @entity26 leader : @entity26 has captained @entity4 to their first @entity2 semi final in 24 years his crossing was less successful and his dribbling suffered but @entity4 were generally satisfied with holding @entity11 back as both sides showed weaknesses			1
unfortunately he missed the chance to add to his four - goal haul so far in the tournament by failing to finish past @entity66 when through on goal			0
but what mattered for @entity26 is that he is one step closer to a dream final in the @entity110 and finally proving his doubters wrong on the international stage			1
the undisputed best remaining player in the @entity2 is two steps from lifting the trophy			0
cushioned touch : and @entity26 will be able to show his skills in the semi finals now after the win close , but no cigar : @entity26 sent his first half dead ball effort flying over @entity66 ' crossbar miss : @entity26 had a chance to score his fifth goal in @entity126 in stoppage time but was thwarted by @entity66			1

@entity26 *dances* away from two *defenders* to start the move for the opener
he has @entity11 's defence in knots with his movement
@entity138 *runner* up smashes a first half free kick over the bar
@entity26 has a quiet second half but keeps his passing tidy
he is one step closer to silencing doubters of his international form
@entity26 misses great chance to double the lead in stoppage time
@entity4 set up semi with @entity154 or @entity155 with 1 - 0 win
