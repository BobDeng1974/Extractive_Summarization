we did n't want to aggravate him too much as he had our money			2

' we could n't get hold of him , ' said @entity28			0
' @entity20 sent text messages begging , saying " please , please , please where are you ? " ' there was nothing he could do – he had no money left – the family had no money left because they had lent it to him			1
' when @entity0 did eventually text back his excuse staggered the couple			1
