by @entity0 it is not the first time a war of words has broken out involving @entity5			2
this time , however , the row is not being played out by the drama ’s characters – but among its famously dedicated fans			0
for decades residents of @entity11 , @entity12 , have claimed that @entity5 , where @entity5 is set , is based on their village			1
tradition : it has long been thought that @entity17 pub in @entity11 is the inspiration for the pub in @entity5 not only did the soap opera ’s creator live nearby , but the @entity22 has been so convinced of @entity11 ’s claim that it uses its landmarks for publicity shots for the @entity27 show			1
but this week a historian from the other side of the @entity30 has started a campaign to convince fans that the soap is , in fact , modelled on his village of @entity36 in @entity37			1
@entity38 believes he has conclusive proof that @entity40 , who created @entity5 , meant for @entity5 to resemble @entity36			1
he argues that @entity11 was chosen for publicity pictures simply because it is close to @entity42 , where the show is recorded			2
not willing to give up their title without a fight , @entity11 ’s community leaders have dismissed their rival village ’s claim as ‘ bonkers ’			2
both , in particular , assert that their local ale house is the inspiration for the @entity17 pub in the soap			0
mr @entity38 claims the original idea for the series came from @entity36 farmer @entity56 who met mr @entity40 in 1946 while he was producing a show called @entity58			0
two years later mr @entity56 was invited to a @entity22 conference in @entity60 where he allegedly said it should commission a farming version of @entity62 , the special agent serial			0
mr @entity38 claims mr @entity40 was so taken with the idea he travelled back to @entity36 to have a proper tour , and would have visited the local pub – the @entity66			0
claims : it has now been claimed that @entity40 , who created @entity5 , pictured , meant for @entity5 to resemble @entity36 ‘ it does not take any stretch of the imagination to picture them in the @entity17 in @entity36 talking over their ideas , ’ said mr @entity38			1
‘ he began designing and building the @entity5 family and @entity5 from that moment			0
’ for their part , @entity11 residents point to an investigation by @entity79 two years ago which found that @entity5 ’s @entity17 pub was based on @entity11 ’s @entity17 and the fictional @entity82 farm was inspired by @entity83 run by mr @entity40 ’s sister - in - law in nearby @entity85			1
@entity86 of @entity88 fan club said the rural setting was ‘ left to the imagination ’ of listeners , but added : ‘ i think @entity40 would say it ’s set in the @entity30			0

@entity11 has long claimed that @entity5 is based on their village
but a historian has claimed the soap is modelled on village of @entity36
