by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 02:19 est , 26 june 2013 a billionaire 's wife raided his safe while he was playing golf to find out what he was worth , a court heard yesterday			1
she never had full access to her secretive husband ’s vast wealth and he only gave her ‘ an allowance ’ , it was said			1
when their relationship broke down and divorce loomed , she opened his safe in search of documents about his finances , the @entity13 was told			1
admission : a judge at the @entity13 heard that a woman ' illegitimately ' looked in her husband 's safe while he played golf to gain financial information ahead of their divorce yesterday a judge condemned her actions and branded her guilty of a ‘ serious breach of candour ’			1
the names of the couple , who have a 26 - year - old son , were kept secret on the orders of the judge			1
but they were described as a family who ‘ enjoyed all the trappings of vast wealth , an international lifestyle with property in different countries , antique furniture , fine art , fully staffed households , private jets , boats and yachts ’			1
their 27 - year marriage began to break down after the wife began an affair , according to the husband , 52			2
he then had an affair of his own – and , in 2009 , a son with his mistress			0
the wife , 57 , said she believed her husband could be worth many hundreds of millions of pounds			2
she said he had been ‘ described in the @entity63 as a “ billionaire ” , ’ and he had threatened to ‘ disappear ’ , with her getting ‘ nothing ’ , if she divorced him			0
in february this year , she won a court order freezing £ 20million of assets belonging to her husband			2
among other things , it prevented him from selling their luxury villa in @entity74 , @entity75 , bought in 1990 for £ 800,000 but now worth £ 10million			0
but mr @entity76 said the freezing order was ‘ flawed ’ because the wife had neglected to mention that she had broken into her husband ’s safe when she applied for it			1
high life : a previous ruling that the husband could n't sell off a property in @entity74 , @entity75 , ( pictured ) among other assets was discharged by a @entity13 judge ruling : mr justice @entity87 said the wife had ' seriously breached her duty of candour ' by accessing her husband 's safe she had been collecting documents for ten years , but claimed they had been ‘ left lying around ’ or had been ‘ ripped up and placed in the rubbish bin ’			1
she said she had also occasionally removed paperwork from his briefcase and a filing cabinet			0
but the judge said that was ‘ not the whole truth ’ and the woman had admitted raiding her husband ’s safe			1
‘ on the occasion in question , [ my husband ] was out playing golf , ’ the woman had said			2
‘ he always kept the key to the safe in his bag			0
i went into the office , removed the key and opened the safe			2
given his secrecy about financial issues , i wished to obtain as much information as possible as i suspected that we would divorce at some stage			0
’ mr @entity76 said : ‘ the failure by the wife to state in her affidavit in support of her freezing application that some of the documents derived from her accessing the husband ’s safe was a serious breach of her duty of candour			1
’ in refusing to renew the ‘ draconian ’ freezing order , the judge said it was fatally flawed , with the figure of £ 20million just ‘ plucked out of the air ’			0
he said freezing orders ‘ usually poisoned ’ such cases , leaving husbands ‘ enraged ’ and relationships remaining ‘ forever soured ’			0
the husband is suing his wife for damages for breach of confidence and misuse of private information			0
the case will be heard first , before divorce proceedings , next january .			0

a high court judge heard that the woman had opened the safe ' illegitimately '
