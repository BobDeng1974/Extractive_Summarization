sentencing @entity26 , judge @entity25 told @entity26 : ' you must have lived very well for those four years			0
' these offences reflect a moderately sophisticated and extremely persistent fraud that garnered you just shy of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds			0
' the benefits represented an income of over forty thousand a year and in addition you had legitimate sources of twenty thousand a year , which would have been equivalent to a six - figure salary before tax			1
' he added : ' is it right that you should go to prison for four - and - a - half months ? i confess i find this difficult			2
' i have a clear public duty to deal with people who commit offences like these , but on balance i am persuaded a prison sentence can be suspended			0
