mr @entity0 claimed he had been in touch with a @entity3 mp about the possibility of defecting the @entity5 should expect further defections because the party is out of date ‘ like @entity8 ’ – according to @entity10 ’s first elected mp			1
@entity0 , who quit the @entity11 to claim a stunning by - election success in @entity13 last week , likened his old party to a ‘ defunct retail model ’ and said it needed to be modern ‘ like @entity16 ’			1
as research showed four @entity11 mps would do better next may if they jumped ship , one @entity11 backbencher said he would ‘ never say never ’ to the prospect of joining @entity23 ’s party			1
mr @entity0 said it was not just the @entity5 that were tempted to join @entity10 , claiming he had been in touch with an unnamed @entity3 mp about the possibility of defecting			1
meanwhile , mr @entity23 has said that if @entity10 held the balance of power in may , it would demand a referendum on the @entity29 by august from both the @entity5 and @entity3			2
he told the @entity31 ’s @entity30 that he would demand ‘ a full , free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the @entity29 ’			0
insiders from @entity10 said mr @entity0 ’s success in @entity13 – and the fact it came so close in the @entity3 stronghold of @entity38 and @entity39 – meant that it would be targeting 25 seats in next may ’s election			1
previously just 12 seats had been targeted			0
a poll yesterday showed that @entity10 was on 25 per cent of the vote – a level of support which would be enough to take 128 seats in the @entity48 , according to one analysis			1
the @entity51 poll for the @entity52 put @entity3 and the @entity5 both on 31 per cent , with the @entity53 on 8 per cent			0
and it found that 41 per cent believe the @entity5 should agree a pact with @entity10			2
@entity55 , professor of politics at @entity57 , said : ‘ today ’s poll suggests @entity10 ’s support has increased much more in the south of @entity61 outside @entity62 than it has elsewhere in the @entity63 – by a staggering 34 points			2
‘ if that level was recorded throughout the @entity69 , @entity10 could win as many as 128 seats , with no less than 102 of them coming from the @entity11 , whose vote in the region is down 14 points			1

a poll yesterday showed that @entity10 was on 25 per cent of the vote - which would be enough to take 128 seats , according to one analysis the @entity77 reported that four @entity11 mps would be more likely to retain their seats if they defected to @entity10			1
@entity80 , a professor at @entity81 , said jumping ship could help @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 in @entity86 and @entity87 in @entity88			0
@entity89 in @entity69 would also benefit , but he has said he is stepping down			0
all four have said they will not join @entity10			2
but one senior backbencher told the @entity52 that the situation could change if the @entity5 lose the @entity93 and @entity94 by - election next month			0
‘ if they [ @entity10 ] take @entity93 and @entity94 , a number of people will conclude they have a better chance of being re-elected as @entity10 , ’ he said			2
one of @entity10 ’s targets is likely to be @entity100 , @entity11 mp for @entity101 and @entity102 , who replied ‘ you should never say never in politics ’ when he was asked on the @entity31 ’s @entity103 whether he would defect			1
however he added : ‘ my very strong preference is to stay within the @entity11			0
’ speaking on the @entity31 ’s @entity107 , mr @entity0 said the @entity5 needed to modernise			0
‘ the way the @entity11 party is retailing politics is like the way @entity8 retailed music : it ’s a defunct retail model , ’ he said			0
‘ i argued that we needed to @entity16 politics , we ought to make the @entity11 a bit more like @entity16 , but the @entity11 ca n’t change and wo n’t change			0
’ mr @entity0 also revealed that one labour mp is considering switching			2
but the party ’s @entity118 dismissed the claim as ‘ typical bull * * * * ’ .			0

new @entity10 mp @entity0 *predicts* more defections
research shows four @entity11 mps would do better if they joined @entity10
under *current* *opinion* polls @entity10 could take 128 seats next may
