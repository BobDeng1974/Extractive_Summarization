by @entity0 one @entity1 : the stamp features @entity4 @entity3 and was first issued in 1950			1
the shape of his head as it appears on the stamp was used to create the shape of a pool and open space of roof in a futuristic @entity14 home nestled deep in @entity14 's @entity16 rainforest sits a futuristic pod - like six - bedroom house on a man - made lake , inspired by its owners ' passion for stamp collecting			1
influenced by stamps inside and out , the centrepiece of the home is a swimming pool in the middle of the structure , based on the figure head of the @entity3 stamp			1
dubbed the stamp house by architect @entity32 , who designed it , he said the influences evolved after a conversation with his stamp collector clients and owners @entity38 and @entity39			1
' it 's @entity42 's favourite @entity4 stamp - it 's not particularly valuable i do n't think , it 's just one of his favourite , so the figure head in the in the stamp was used to create the central focus feature of the house , ' he told @entity50			1
@entity51 was a stamp featuring @entity3 , who was the first @entity4 to be featured on a stamp when it was first issued in 1950			2
a picture of him is also featured on the $ 2 coin			0
the figure head shape is reflected in the open court yard roof above the pool and the cut out gardened area around it			1
' the stamp idea is central , it 's all about how spaces oscillate around the pool '			2
with each of the bedrooms in the pod - like arms of the building opening to the pool and courtyard area , this strikes a balance between the public and private areas of the house , mr @entity32 said			1
the stamp - theme continues onto the exterior of the building , where perforations based stamp sheets cover the concrete steel - reinforced cyclone proof walls			1
' it 's almost as if the house has been gift wrapped , ' mr @entity32 said			2
because the house is located in a lake , the exterior and the perforations are reflected back into the building			1
located on 26 hectares and with a 600 - metre private beach front , one of northern @entity14 's largest , the man - made lake was inspired by @entity39 , who is originally from the @entity95 , and the long tradition of @entity97 and @entity95 people living over water			1
the ' stamp house ' was inspired inside and out after conversations between the architect and the stamp collector owners and architect @entity32 's unique design won the top award at the @entity107 on friday and will go on to compete at the national competition centrepiece : the focal point of the home is a swimming pool based on the figure head of the @entity3 postage stamp issued in the 1950s			1
the stamp is owner @entity116 's favourite , and the shape is used in the roof of the open air courtyard and a cut out garden area around the pool mr @entity32 said this was another example of how his conversations with his clients , who gave him no brief , influenced the design of the house and how these were extrapolated into a larger idea			1
the lake also enables the surrounding forest to be reflected back into the house			2
because of its sensitive location , the house is 100 per cent ' green ' and completely off grid with no power , water or sewer			2
this sees it produce its own electricity , water and process waste including sewerage			0
' it generates all of its own renewable energy through solar , ' mr @entity32 said			0
' there are solar panels ... and batteries			0
the house harvests all its own water through the roof and treats all of its own waste			2
its carbon neutral in operation , ' mr @entity32 said			0
the water harvesting facility is located under the swimming pool			1
mr @entity32 said the house 's pod - like form was was based on a resort - style prototype based on relationship between public and private spaces within the home			1
on friday , the house was awarded the @entity165 for @entity166 ( new ) at the @entity167 ' @entity107 , the top award of the night			1
mr @entity32 said winning was amazing			0
' we were thrilled the result - the recognition from our peers that it was all worthy of what we were trying to do , ' he said			0
despite the house receiving its occupancy certification in december 2012 , with the finishing touches still being completed after this date , mr @entity32 did not enter it into the competition until this year			0
the exterior of the home also reflects the owner 's passion for stamp collecting , with the perforated walls based on stamp sheets and creating a ' gift wrapped ' effect called @entity189 by its owners , the house is set on 26 hectares is currently for sale and due to be relisted for $ 25 million			1
the property also features about 600 metres of beach front , one of the biggest private beaches in @entity14 the win will see the house entered into the @entity197 to be announced in @entity198 on november 6 , against other winners from each state and territory			2
' i do n't know what it 's up against ... but national - level is pretty high so i 'm sure there will be a range of high - quality homes vying to win			0
the competition will be tough			0
' mr @entity32 , said both the clients and the five - year project were ' one in a million '			2
' all our projects , we like them to be about the clients or the organisation we are dealing with			0
' he added that the clients ' interests directly influence his firm 's work			0
he said his clients were also ' thrilled with the finished product '			0
' it 's amazing that the original concept and design is what that have got - and they are loving it			0
' ' from our point of view its great			0
we had this idea that was a bit way out all these years ago and to have it now finished and crystallised into reality us quite unique			0
' building a house in the middle of the @entity16 rainforest meant there was an ' extensive ' planning and approval process to build in such a sensitive area , but mr @entity32 said it was ' worth it in the end '			2
called @entity189 , by its owners , the house is for sale and is due to be relisted for about $ 15 million			0
it is currently lived in and also available to be rented as an executive retreat and is believed to have cost the owners about $ 9 million to purchase the land and build the house			0
mr @entity32 's firm , @entity247 was established 10 years ago and he has worked as an architect for about 14 years			0
originally from @entity250 , the 39 - year - old is based in @entity251 in @entity14			1
with the house located on a man - made lake inspired by @entity97 floating homes , the reflection of the perforated exterior reflects back into the building , as does the lush @entity16 forest surrounding it carbon neutral : because if its sensitive location in the middle of pristine rainforest on the @entity14 coast , the house generates its own renewable energy through solar , harvests its own water and treats its own waste			1
