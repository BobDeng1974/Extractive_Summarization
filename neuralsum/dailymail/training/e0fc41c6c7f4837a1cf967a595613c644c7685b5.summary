they checked out the apartment in march when there was no fence — and were outraged to see the barricade there on move - in day in july			2

developer @entity128 has drawn much criticism for its plan to build a posh tower on @entity9 's @entity132 using massive tax breaks — but then make its affordable - housing tenants use a different entrance from high - paying residents the building 's ' poor door ' would n't be its only difference : under its original plan , some of the higher - paying residents would also have access to different amenities			2
@entity0 claims the fence is there so tenants with smaller balconies and who pay market - rate do n't get jealous of the amenity she gets for a lower price plans for the luxury skyscraper at 1 @entity154 were slightly altered in august : the building still has separate entrances , but all residents will now have access to such building amenities as a courtyard and river - view roof deck the affordable segment 's lobby will also be stylishly appointed and set facing a park , the developer claims			1
