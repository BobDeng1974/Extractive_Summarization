meanwhile , only 10 per cent showed support for the @entity1 , which is viewed as having failed to oppose the overthrow of long - serving president @entity48 by the @entity49			1
the figures will come as a blow to president @entity31 , who made an impassioned speech in @entity54 in 2009 that promised to seek a ' new beginning ' for the @entity1 and @entity34 in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent @entity59 and @entity60 wars			1
fanbase : many in favour of the @entity1 come from @entity41 and @entity42 , with the @entity64 its biggest supporter pro-moscow militants guard the @entity69 crash site : in @entity71 , pro-america reaction has plunged 28 points in just one year to 23 per cent in large part due to @entity1 's opposition to its intervention in @entity76 @entity1 is in more danger than it has been for years because of the @entity80 uprising in @entity59 , a top @entity1 intelligence official has warned			1
