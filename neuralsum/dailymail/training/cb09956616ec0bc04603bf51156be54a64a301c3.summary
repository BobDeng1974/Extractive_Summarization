' they said they ' apologised ' for any distress caused			1
she said : ' i decided to take a stance as i believe no woman should be made to feel embarrassed by wanting to breastfeed their child in public			0
' women have rights to be protected from less favourable treatment and to equal access to facilities just because they want to breastfeed their children			0
' it 's important that when this kind of thing happens we challenge the practices and policies of services providers to ensure it does n't happen again to others			0
' @entity72 , from @entity73 , represented ms @entity0 and said many women are n't aware of their rights			1
she said : ' this case is important as it gives breastfeeding mums the confidence to know they can challenge discriminatory treatment of this kind			2

this case helps to raise awareness of the issue from both perspectives			0

the @entity30 is a piece of litigation that protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society			0
under the act it is against the law to discriminate against people who are pregnant or who have a child			0
people are protected when using a public service - such as a swimming pool in this case			0
according to the @entity30 discrimination includes the following : ' on this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - ie , feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water , and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested			1
' we do of course apologise for any upset caused			1
the staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby			2
' it may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother			0
' it is clear that additional training is required and this is being arranged with @entity149 for all staff to ensure there is an enhanced awareness and understanding of breastfeeding			2
we will also be working with experts and professionals to ensure that a suitable policy is produced			0

' i mean this has been happening all over the @entity182 and i 'm delighted to be able to set a precedent			0
' i used to think people looked positively at breast feeding but then this happened to me and i heard of a lot of similar cases in the press			2
' the feeling i got was that breastfeeding was okay as long as you do it secretly which i do n't think is acceptable			2
' i think there now needs to be a change in the law and make it a criminal offence to tell somebody they ca n't breastfeed			0
' at the moment if somebody asks a person to leave then what can they do			0
if it 's a criminal law then they can tell the police			0
' miss @entity0 , left , with her mother @entity94 , right and daughter @entity2 , centre , won a discrimination case against @entity213 in @entity27 , @entity4			1
