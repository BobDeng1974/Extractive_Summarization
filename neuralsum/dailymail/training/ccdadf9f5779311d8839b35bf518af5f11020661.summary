the @entity0 has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives , allowing them to monitor and eavesdrop on the majority of the world 's computers - even when they are not connected to the internet			1
the @entity8 - based security software maker @entity7 said it has found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs , with the most infections seen in @entity13 , followed by @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
the targets included government and military institutions , telecommunication companies , banks , energy companies , nuclear researchers , media , and @entity31 activists			0
this ' surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques , and that has been active for almost two decades , ' said @entity33			0
what 's more , even the makers of these hard drives are unaware that these spying programs have been installed , with the @entity0 obtaining their source codes by going so far as to pose as software developers according to former intelligence operatives , or telling the companies the government must do a security audit to make sure their source code is safe			1
according to @entity33 , the spies made a technological breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a computer is turned on			1
disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a pc for a hacker , second only to the bios code invoked automatically as a computer boots up			1
' the hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over , ' lead @entity44 researcher @entity83 said in an interview			0
though the leaders of the still - active espionage campaign could have taken control of thousands of pcs , giving them the ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted , the spies were selective and only established full remote control over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets , according to @entity83			0
he said @entity33 found only a few especially high - value computers with the hard - drive infections			1
the firm declined to publicly name the country behind the spying campaign , but said it was closely linked to @entity102 , the @entity0 - led cyberweapon that was used to attack @entity13 's uranium enrichment facility			1
the @entity0 is the @entity104 agency responsible for gathering electronic intelligence			2
a former @entity0 employee told @entity107 that @entity33 's analysis was correct , and that people still in the spy agency valued these espionage programs as highly as @entity102			2
another former intelligence operative confirmed that the @entity0 had developed the prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives , but said he did not know which spy efforts relied on it			1
@entity0 spokeswoman @entity118 said the agency was aware of the @entity44 report but would not comment on it publicly			2
@entity44 published the technical details of its research on monday , a move that could help infected institutions detect the spying programs , some of which trace back as far as 2001			1
@entity33 ( file photo ) published the details of his research on friday the disclosure could hurt the @entity0 's surveillance abilities , already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor @entity135			2
@entity135 's revelations have upset some @entity104 allies and slowed the sales of @entity104 technology products abroad			0
the exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater backlash against @entity144 technology , particularly in countries such as @entity17 , which is already drafting regulations that would require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of their software code for inspection			1
@entity152 , one of five members of @entity104 president @entity48 's @entity154 on @entity156 and @entity157 , said the @entity44 report showed that it is essential for the country to consider the possible impact on trade and diplomatic relations before deciding to use its knowledge of software flaws for intelligence gathering			1
' there can be serious negative effects on other @entity104 interests , ' @entity152 said			0
technological breakthrough @entity44 's reconstructions of the spying programs show that they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen companies , comprising essentially the entire market			1
they include @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity180 said they had no knowledge of these spying programs			1
@entity178 and @entity181 declined to comment			0
@entity179 did not respond to requests for comment			0
getting the source code @entity83 said the authors of the spying programs must have had access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions of the hard drives			1
that code can serve as a roadmap to vulnerabilities , allowing those who study it to launch attacks much more easily			0
' there is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [ hard drive ] operating system using public information , ' @entity83 said			0
concerns about access to source code flared after a series of high - profile cyberattacks on @entity209 and other @entity104 companies in 2009 that were blamed on @entity17			2
investigators have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to source code from several big @entity104 tech and defense companies			2
it is not clear how the @entity0 may have obtained the hard drives ' source code			1
@entity176 spokesman @entity220 said the company ' has not provided its source code to government agencies			0
' the other hard drive makers would not say if they had shared their source code with the @entity0			1
@entity177 spokesman @entity226 said it has ' secure measures to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and other technologies			0
' @entity180 spokesman @entity234 said the company took the security of its products seriously and ' we are not aware of any instances of foreign code			0
' according to former intelligence operatives , the @entity0 has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies , including asking directly and posing as a software developer according to former intelligence operatives , the @entity0 has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies , including asking directly and posing as a software developer			1
if a company wants to sell products to the @entity253 or another sensitive @entity104 agency , the government can request a security audit to make sure the source code is safe			0
' they do n't admit it , but they do say , " we 're going to do an evaluation , we need the source code , " ' said @entity260 , a partner at security consulting firm @entity261 and former @entity0 analyst			2
' it 's usually the @entity0 doing the evaluation , and it 's a pretty small leap to say they 're going to keep that source code			2
' the @entity0 declined to comment on any allegations in the @entity44 report			0
@entity118 said the agency complies with the law and @entity273 directives to protect the @entity104 and its allies ' from a wide array of serious threats			0
' @entity33 called the authors of the spying program ' the @entity279 , ' named after their embrace of complex encryption formulas			0
the group used a variety of means to spread other spying programs , such as by compromising jihadist websites , infecting usb sticks and cds , and developing a self - spreading computer worm called @entity290 , @entity33 said			1
@entity290 was like @entity102 in that it exploited two of the same undisclosed software flaws , known as ' zero days , ' which strongly suggested collaboration by the authors , @entity83 said			0
he added that it was ' quite possible ' that the equation group used @entity290 to scout out targets for @entity102 in @entity13 and spread the virus .			2

the @entity0 has figured out how to hide spying and *sabotage* software deep within hard drives , according to cyber researchers and former operatives
the group said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs
the most infections were seen in @entity13 , followed by @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21
the infections started in 2001 , but *increased* *drastically* in 2008 , the year president @entity48 was elected
the tools are *designed* to run on computers even when they are not connected to the @entity318 , and even the makers of some of the hard drives are unaware that these programs have been *embedded*
