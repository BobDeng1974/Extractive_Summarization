by @entity1 reporter published : 14:13 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 05:13 est , 5 november 2012 for a few months @entity3 's @entity2 was the tallest building in @entity5 , putting every other construction in the shade			2
but @entity8 has now reclaimed bragging rights after officially unveiling a mixed office and residential tower called @entity12			1
the tower , sheathed in copper - colored glass , tops out at 338 metres ( 1,109ft ) , beating the @entity15 by 92ft			2
view from the top : the @entity12 in @entity8 , right , is officially @entity5 's tallest building the tops : the @entity12 will only be the tallest for a few months until a building next door is completed top dog : the @entity21 , right , is officially @entity5 's biggest building at 1,109ft it actually became @entity5 's tallest in september , while still under construction , according to the construction information company @entity24			1
but it 's reign is likely to be almost as short			0
it 's next door to the under - construction @entity29 , which is to reach 506 meters ( 1,660 feet ) when it 's completed next year			0
both are in a sprawling development called @entity21 that also holds two other buildings that once were @entity5 's tallest			0
tall order : the @entity12 is dwarfed by skyscrapers in @entity36 and the @entity37 bragging rights : @entity3 's @entity2 was the biggest building in @entity5 until overtaken by the @entity12 the complex is an eye - catching demonstration of @entity8 's transformation from drab shabbiness to swaggering prosperity , driven largely by oil and natural gas revenues			1
@entity12 ' distinctly shows the activity of @entity50 business ' according to @entity51 , director of the @entity53 company ,			2
he told the news agency @entity55 : ' it demonstrates that all of @entity50 is on a level with countries of the eurozone , continuing its planned development and moving forward			0
' but competing with @entity5 countries for tallest building is playing in the minor leagues			0
there are nearly 60 buildings in @entity36 , @entity66 and the @entity37 that are taller , topped by @entity68 's @entity67 - about 2.5 times taller than @entity53 city at 828 meters ( 2,717 feet ) .			1

@entity12 has bragging rights for now , but it ca *n't* compete with skyscrapers in @entity36 , @entity66 and @entity37
