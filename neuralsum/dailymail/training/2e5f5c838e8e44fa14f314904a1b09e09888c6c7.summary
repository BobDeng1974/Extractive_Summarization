@entity0 was a much wanted and deeply loved son , who was conceived after nine gruelling @entity2 attempts			1
as his mother @entity5 , now 56 , says : ‘ we wanted a child so desperately , we ’d have done anything			2
' i kept thinking : “ next time it ’ll be our turn to be lucky			2
” ’ ‘ everyone called @entity0 the gentle giant			1
he was 6ft 2in in and 18st , and when he enveloped me in one of his enormous hugs , i fitted under his armpit , ' said @entity16 of her son @entity0 , who died two years ago when she held @entity0 in her arms for the first time , the endless hospital appointments were forgotten			1
‘ none of it mattered , because i knew from then on that our lives were going to be all about @entity0			1
’ he grew up to be musically gifted and mad about sport , and @entity5 would spend hours driving him to football coaching , rugby or guitar lessons			2
‘ our lives — mine and his dad @entity31 — were really just about supporting @entity0 to do whatever he wanted in life , ’ she says			1
‘ and we loved every single minute of it			2
’ it ’s been two years , four months , six days and a handful of hours since @entity0 ’s sudden death from an undiagnosed heart condition during rugby training at his school in @entity41			1
@entity5 still struggles to comprehend how the life of the super-fit son she loved so much could be extinguished in an instant			2
‘ everyone called @entity0 the gentle giant , ’ she says			1
‘ he was 6ft 2in and 18st , and when he enveloped me in one of his enormous hugs , i fitted under his armpit			2
’ the only shred of comfort @entity5 can find is in the belief that by telling @entity0 ’s story , other young people with undiagnosed heart conditions will be saved			1
‘ @entity0 had symptoms — recurrent fainting during exercise — for nine years before he died , but we were constantly told : “ you have only to look at him to see there ’s nothing wrong with his heart			1
” ’ tomorrow , the charity @entity66 ( @entity66 ) is unveiling a three - minute film to raise awareness of the risk of sudden cardiac death in young people , especially those involved in sports			1
every week , 12 apparently fit young people under the age of 35 die of undiagnosed heart conditions — 600 every year			1
many of them , @entity66 says , could be saved by specialist screening during childhood			1
this involves a simple electrocardiogram ( @entity82 ) that looks at the electrical activity of the heart			1
@entity85 , professor of inherited cardiovascular disease and sports cardiology at @entity88 in @entity89 , oversees @entity66 ’s screening programme			2
‘ our lives — mine and his dad @entity31 — were really just about supporting @entity0 to do whatever he wanted in life			1
and we loved every single minute of it , ' said @entity5 ‘ taking part in sport does n’t cause young sudden cardiac death , but forcing the heart to work harder significantly increases the risk if there is an underlying and undiagnosed condition , ’ he says			1
‘ in 80 per cent of cases there are no prior symptoms			2
but when symptoms do present , they include recurrent chest pain ( particularly when exercising ) , palpitations , breathlessness , dizziness and fainting			2
‘ no one should ignore these symptoms , and if your gp is unconcerned , seek a second opinion with a specialist			2
’ @entity0 played football competitively from the age of eight and that same year had the first of a series of fainting incidents			1
‘ the first time it happened was during a match , ’ says @entity5			2
‘ he ’d passed out and stopped breathing			0
‘ @entity31 and i ran out on to the pitch			0
@entity31 performed cpr and @entity0 came round quickly			1
‘ we were assured by a paediatrician we saw in @entity134 that day it had been caused by a combination of migraine and stress , which he ’d never suffered from before			0
' reluctantly , we accepted his opinion			0
’ six weeks later , a private paediatrician examined @entity0 , but he found nothing either			1
eighteen months after that , @entity0 collapsed on a cross- country run			1
desperately worried , @entity5 , and @entity31 , 61 , who works in the construction industry , took him to their gp : ‘ he ran an @entity82 and assured us the problem was dehydration : @entity0 was n’t drinking enough when he exercised			1
’ from that point , @entity5 went to every game @entity0 played and did n’t take her eyes off him for a second			1
‘ i never watched a match , i only ever watched @entity0 , ’ she says			1
in january 2011 , just before his 16th birthday , he collapsed for the third time			0
according to @entity161 rules — @entity0 was playing an away match for his county — anyone who collapses during a game must be taken to hospital , so he was taken by ambulance from mid-wales to @entity169			1
the following day , a consultant cardiologist sent him for an ultrasound to check for structural heart faults and an @entity82			1
@entity0 grew up to be musically gifted and mad about sport he was sent home with a heart monitor that he wore for three days to check whether the rhythm of his heart was normal			1
a week later , he performed tests on a treadmill			0
‘ i was so relieved , ’ says @entity5			0
‘ i thought we were going to get some answers			0
' but we were told he was perfectly fit and that the problem was definitely dehydration			0
’ the day before @entity0 died , on july 18 , 2012 , he came home complaining of chest pains			1
@entity5 , slightly exasperated , told him to drink more water			0
ten hours later , she was in @entity188 ’s car park after work when her phone rang			0
it was the school nurse to tell her that @entity0 had collapsed			1
‘ sit him up and give him a fizzy drink ... ’ @entity5 began			0
but without giving any detail , the nurse said : ‘ i ’m afraid it ’s much worse than that			0
’ she rushed to the school , but the moment she saw the air ambulance on the pitch , she knew			0
@entity5 and @entity31 were too numb with shock even to cry			0
‘ it was july , but i just remember feeling so , so cold , ’ @entity5 says			0
‘ all night long we shook with cold and shock			0
’ professor @entity85 says that though sudden cardiac death is rare , one in 300 people harbour a potentially fatal fault in the electrical system of their heart			1
these faults can occasionally result in very rapid electrical impulses			0
during these episodes the heart becomes stunned and stops contracting			1
the brain is then deprived of oxygen , causing the person to lose consciousness and collapse			0
the only method of restarting the heart is to deliver an external electrical shock to reset the electrical system			1
if this does not occur within ten minutes , the heart may never restart — which happened in @entity0 ’s case			1
a post-mortem showed his heart appeared normal and his family was told the most likely cause of death was an electrical fault			2
professor @entity85 says that many paediatricians and even some cardiologists may not have had the training or experience in reading these very rare , abnormal @entity82 heart traces , which is why @entity66 ’s specialist team is so important			1
‘ these heart defects are either hereditary , which means they run in families , or congenital , which means the young person is born with something unique to them , ’ he says			2
‘ they can affect the structure of the heart or the electrical apparatus			2
but if you have ominous symptoms , more tests may be required			0
‘ if a potentially life - threatening condition is detected , they may have to make lifestyle changes , have corrective surgery or take medication — and , in some cases , have an internal cardiac defibrillator fitted that shocks the heart into normal rhythm			1
’ @entity265 , 21 , had no symptoms before he died during rugby training in @entity268 , @entity269			2
on october 22 , 2008 , he left home at 7.40am for teacher training at a local primary school , followed by rugby practice that evening			0
his mother @entity274 was chopping vegetables for dinner when the phone rang			0
@entity274 , 59 , the director of a building surveying practice , and her husband @entity278 , also 59 , a factory manager , drove the nine miles to the rugby ground			0
at the first set of traffic lights , @entity274 knew with a certainty she ca n’t explain that the youngest of her three boys was dead			0
‘ the moment we got to the hospital , we were shown to the bereaved relatives ’ room			0
i just broke down , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity265 lay on an elevated hospital bed , wires and tubes everywhere , and i could see he was lifeless			0
‘ as a mother of teenage boys you wait for the call to say your child has been involved in a car accident or has fallen off his bike , ’ says @entity274			0
‘ you ’re not expecting to hear a fit young man has dropped down dead playing rugby			0
’ a post mortem revealed @entity265 had died of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( @entity308 ) — essentially his heart failed to pick up the impulse that makes it beat			1
‘ @entity265 had no symptoms , ’ says @entity274			0
after he left school , he ’d wanted to join the @entity313			0
but at 6ft , he was too tall			0
‘ the irony is that if he had joined the forces , he ’d have had a full medical and the problem with his heart might have been found			2
’ dr @entity318 , @entity66 ’s director of screening , believes all 14 to 35 - year - olds should be screened			1
‘ though this will not identify all those at risk and there can be false positives as well as false negatives , ’ he says			0
‘ in @entity328 , where screening is mandatory for all young people engaged in sports , the incidence of sudden cardiac death has been reduced by 90 per cent			2
’ @entity16 says : ‘ if only i ’d known about @entity66 i could have helped @entity0 get specialist screening			1
' but the first i heard about the screening programme was two days after he died			2
’ and @entity265 ’s mum @entity274 says : ‘ it could have been avoided by a test that takes ten minutes and costs £ 35			2
’ she thinks all teenagers should have the test			0
' @entity340 does n’t heal — you just get better at coping with the pain			0
