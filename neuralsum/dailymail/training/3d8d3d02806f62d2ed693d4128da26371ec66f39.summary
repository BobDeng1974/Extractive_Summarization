@entity0 cleared the final hurdle to exiting administration and immediately set about fighting their way back to @entity6 football ’s top level			1
foundation of @entity0 chief @entity8 hailed supporters for rallying round to keep their club from dying - but warned that plenty of hard graft will be required to bring long - term stability to @entity14			1
the completion of millionaire businesswoman @entity17 ’s £ 2.5million takeover means the foundation - funded by monthly pledges from punters - are now legally committed to raising £ 1.4m a year towards operating costs			1
done deal : @entity17 has completed her takeover of @entity0 , the @entity24 has confirmed finally something to smile about : relegated @entity0 have new owners and have been taken out of administration they plan to eventually take ownership of the club , but have to repay within five years the ‘ capital loan ’ @entity31 has issued to fund a cva at a club left close to extinction by former owner @entity35			1
‘ it ’s a great relief for supporters , ’ @entity8 told @entity36			0
‘ they are the ones who have constantly put their hands in their pockets , supported the club and the foundation			1
‘ every single @entity0 supporter who has done that should congratulate themselves			2
but the hard work starts now for the foundation because , essentially , we have financial commitments to be able to keep the club afloat with working capital – and we have to pay @entity17 back as well			1
‘ so the key task for the club is to get into a stable financial position and prepare for the @entity57 next season			2
’ starting with a completely clean balance sheet , and with the foundation providing funds on top of ticket sales and commercial revenues , it is anticipated @entity0 will be in a strong position to challenge @entity66 for the @entity57 title			1
but @entity8 said : ‘ let ’s take on those challenges tomorrow			0
today we ’re over the line and we ’re delighted			0
’ battler : @entity73 's @entity0 side has endured a tough season on the pitch manager @entity73 , out of contract in a matter of weeks , has yet to be given any assurances about his future			1
admitting that any decision will be entirely down to @entity31 and her advisers , @entity8 insisted : ‘ that ’s an unfair question to ask today			2
@entity17 will come into the club on monday and start doing the job she needs to do			1
‘ i ’m sure she ’ll be having discussions with various people , meeting all the staff and players			0
that is day one of her new job			0
‘ right now we ’re just celebrating that everything is done and dusted – and the @entity96 are no longer involved in @entity0			2
’ @entity31 also warned of the workload ahead in a statement released on friday night , declaring : ‘ i am truly delighted to be able to confirm that i am now the proud majority shareholder in @entity99			1
it has been a long hard struggle to get to this point but together we have achieved our goal			0
‘ the next few months - even years - wo n’t be easy as we work hard to rebuild our club			2
however , let ’s not think about that today - let ’s just enjoy ! i have absolutely no doubt that together we will succeed			0
‘ as the days and weeks unfold we will , of course , share our plans for the future			0
however , as you will all know , we are now into the process of making a formal offer for the remaining shares in the club and while that process is in train , there are some restrictions on how much we can say publicly			2
so ... no press conferences yet , i ’m afraid			0
‘ however , in the meantime , enjoy the moment			0
this is a great day in the history of our club			0
