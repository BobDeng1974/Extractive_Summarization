by @entity0 the study comes 30 years after president @entity3 kick started the process , making the @entity6 the world leader in missile defences @entity9 has no need for a ballistic missile defence system because countries posing a threat are too far away , a new study says			1
but modest investments should be made in defence system research to prepare for the future safety of the nation			1
the @entity19 study also said current technology was not up to scratch and @entity9 should keep an eye on it as it progresses			1
these measures would place the nation in a good position to adopt a ready system if it is needed later on			0

mr @entity3 unveiled his ' star wars ' vision in 1983 with the expectation that incoming ballistic missiles could be shot down with combined space and land - based missile and laser systems			2
but a system capable of that is yet to come to fruition			0
according to @entity19 , the superpower 's current land and sea - based systems would be quite effective against a limited attack by basic , short - range missiles like those possessed by @entity47 and @entity48			0
current land and sea - based systems would be quite effective against a limited attack by basic , short - range missiles like those possessed by @entity47 and @entity48 @entity53 has been trigger happy with missile testing since assuming his role as @entity47 's leader but its system would be put under significant pressure if a mass attack occurred using longer - range missiles , with warheads that can travel up to seven kilometres a second			0
the institute said the most suitable system relevant to @entity9 's threats was the @entity69 ballistic missile defence system on board some @entity6 and @entity72 warships - tipped for the nation 's new air warfare destroyers			1
@entity53 has been trigger happy with missile testing since assuming his role as @entity47 's leader			0

study *recommends* @entity9 continues to invest in missile research
right now ballistic missile defence system technology not up to scratch
not even the @entity6 could defend itself with its system if a major threat came
best missile technology for @entity9 exists on @entity6 and @entity72 warships
