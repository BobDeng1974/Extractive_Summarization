by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 5 august 2013 it was a familiar sight in the @entity2 from 2004 to 2007 , a long grey coat celebrating up and down the touchline			0
but @entity5 has said his famous grey trenchcoat wo n't be making an appearance at @entity8 this time around			1
the @entity9 said he does n't want to look back to past successes in his new role , but forge ahead and determine the club 's future			1
familiar : @entity5 's long trenchcoat was a staple of his first spell at @entity17 no more : the coat , which spurred chants from opposition fans , is now on display in the @entity8 museum then and now : @entity5 , on this summer 's pre-season tour , says the coat will not make a comeback ' i do n’t have it now , it is in the @entity29 , ' he told the club 's official magazine			1
' i do n’t think it ’s good to be nostalgic about it , to think about things that happened in the past			0
i did that a lot with coats and watches i wore during some seasons			0
' when it ’s over , it ’s over and we look forward to a new season and project			0
so , not the same coat , that ’s for sure			0
' young guns : @entity5 says he wants to look to the future of @entity8 , with @entity49 in action talent : 21 - year - old @entity51 and 22 - year - old @entity52 ( below ) are already @entity8 regulars in keeping with this mindset , @entity5 also said his main priority is to develop players at the club , while still retaining his famous winning mentality			1
' normally , people measure success with trophies			0
' they ’re very closely related , but i do n’t think it is so linear like that – especially in a squad like we have , which is a squad for the future , ' he said			0
' we have to work to improve a big percentage of these players who are very young , preparing the future of this club			2
' i ’m very , very focused on this , but at the same time always trying to get results , even knowing the best time will arrive in a couple of years			0
' the official @entity76 is on @entity77 ( august 5 ) @entity79 youngsters like @entity80 , @entity49 and @entity81 have all featured in pre-season before looking for top - flight loans , while players like @entity51 and @entity52 are already some of the club 's key players			1
both those players scored in @entity8 's first match of the @entity90 leg of their pre-season tour against @entity92			1
the @entity79 triumphed 2 - 0 in a match which was overshadowed by a horrific challenge on @entity95 , which saw @entity92 's @entity97 see red			0
@entity5 's coat was a constant throughout his first spell at @entity17 , prompting opposition fans to taunt him with chants like ' your coat 's from @entity104			1
' @entity5 also revealed that coming back to @entity17 was easy because of his love for the club			1
' i love the football in this country but , of course , @entity110 felt this respect from the fans ; even @entity114 was coaching other clubs , especially last season when i felt – even by not being at @entity17 – many supporters wished me to be back , ' he said			1
' that was important ' the best thing is that i do n’t have to learn how to love my club			2
when i came for the first time , and to @entity92 and @entity122 , i had to learn , and now it ’s the same club i already love			2
' when you have big emotional connections with a club you become easily a top professional , somebody who gives everything and cares for the club without a selfish vision of his job			0
' to already be a @entity8 fan like i am , and the manager , it gives me a big push to try to be better and better			2

@entity8 manager will not wear his trenchcoat next season after *donating* it to club 's museum
@entity5 is determined to bring young players through from the *academy* into the first team
@entity9 said the love of the fans was crucial in his return to @entity17
