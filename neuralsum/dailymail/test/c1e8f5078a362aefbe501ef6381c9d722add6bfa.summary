detectives combed through a series of @entity51 photos from the @entity52 before identifying @entity9 as a suspect			0
when he was arrested in november 2014 , police linked his dna to the attacks			1
he had not previously been on the dna database because he had not been in trouble with police			2
jailing him at @entity62 for 16 years , judge @entity61 said @entity0 was a ' violent sexual predator ' who had ruined his victims ' lives			1
she said : ' the damage you have caused these women and no doubt will continue to cause will last the rest of their lives			0
they are serving a life sentence			0
' the younger girl was 16 with her whole life to look forward to and she is moving forward with this over her			2
' the second victim has been traumatised by what you did to her			2
nothing i can say or do will change that			0
' you are a violent sexual predator , i have no doubt you were excited by your use of violence which was far beyond anything that was needed to achieve your purpose			0
' during the hearing , the court heard how @entity0 had raped his first victim during a night out when she was marking the end of her gcses			1
the soldier had asked his victim to go upstairs to talk and she agreed because her feet were hurting after dancing in high heels			2
the court heard how the subsequent attack was so violent that the teenager had to be rushed to hospital to be treated for her injuries			0
judge @entity61 said : ' i doubt anyone who was there will forget the sight of that young girl as she ran from the scene of the attack			0
' the court heard how police had launched a manhunt for @entity9 after the first rape , releasing an e-fit in a public appeal			2
wanted : at the time of the attack , police released this grainy @entity121 footage showing @entity9 ( right ) leaving the club the first rape took place in @entity124 - which has now been replaced by a casino - in @entity2 's @entity14 ( file picture - club not pictured ) but @entity0 , who was based with the @entity128 's 16th regiment at @entity1 barracks at the time , was not caught			1
instead , two months later , he targeted another woman after prowling the @entity30 area armed with a knife			1
in a desperate attempt to protect herself , the victim told @entity0 she was pregnant and had @entity137			1
but @entity0 shoved his hand over her mouth , thrust the knife into her face and punched her repeatedly , knocking out her teeth and leaving her with permanent scarring			1
after raping her , @entity0 told the woman to wait in the bushes for ten minutes to allow him time to escape			1
he threatened to ' finish her ' off if she moved			0
the court heard how the victim told police it was ' like an eagle had landed on me '			2
the court heard how , during his time in the army , @entity9 once bit off part of a comrade 's earlobe and broke his nose			2
he hit another soldier in the face and punched a third so many times he lost consciousness			0
but the soldier , who served in @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , never faced a civil or military charges for these offences			0
he was only discharged from the army in 2007 for using cocaine			0
several years after the attacks , he was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression			2
in court , the defendant acknowledged he was not suffering mental health problems at the time of the attacks in 2003			2
@entity179 , defending , said his client wanted forgiveness from his victims , but was not expecting it			0
he told the court : ' there 's nothing i can say to undo what this defendant visited on these two victims , nothing can put matters right and absolutely nothing that can turn back the clock			0
' he added : ' he entered pleas of guilty , he has not prevaricated and whatever else he 's done he has at least spared these two victims of these appalling crimes the ordeal of having to give evidence in front of a jury			1
' he served in the army for a number of years and while it 's true he was discharged in circumstances relating to the taking of cocaine , it 's also right that there 's no evidence that whilst he was serving in the army he did anything other than discharge his duty satisfactorily			2
' mr @entity179 said @entity0 also recognised that he had been ' a bad person ' for carrying out the attacks			1
@entity212 was based at @entity1 barracks ( pictured ) in south east @entity2 at the time of the attacks in 2003 ' i asked him why he did it and he said " i was a bad person in those days , i recognise it and i say it , i do n't recognise myself now as the person i was then " ' , he told the court			2
' i asked him if there was anything he wished me to say that he felt he would want said , he said : " i just want forgiveness , i 'm not expecting it , i do n't deserve it but i want it and i need it "			0
' he acknowledges that he will never be forgiven for these appalling offences and that 's a burden he will carry the burden for the rest of his days			0
' mr @entity179 added that @entity9 was on the point of refusing to come into court to face his two victims			0
@entity0 , who appeared in the dock in a dark green prison tracksuit and a full beard , sat with his head in his hands and sighed throughout the hearing			1
the former soldier , from @entity238 , @entity2 , will also have to sign the sex offender 's register indefinitely			0
after the hearing , investigating officer detective sergeant @entity241 praised the bravery of the two victims			0
he said : ' both young women were subjected to horrific and gratuitous ordeals at the hands of a dangerous and predatory individual			0
' the devastating affect of these attacks on both women is indescribable			0
for the past 12 years they have had to get on with their lives knowing their attacker was still out there			1
' it is only due to their courage and fortitude that @entity0 was charged with these abhorrent and cowardly attacks			1
without their support he would not have been brought to justice			0
