the @entity1 set aside a staggering $ 11,519,617 on hotels and ground transportation costs for president @entity4 and his entourage to attend @entity7 's memorial service last week , it was revealed today			1
one contract letter budgeted more than $ 8.2 million for ' passenger vehicles , suvs , vans , and buses , as well as supplies and goods vehicles such as pickup trucks , box trucks , and larger capacity vehicles , ' according to documents first posted online by the @entity19			2
two more authorized @entity1 to spend in excess of $ 3.2 million on hotels from december 6 to january 20 , including costs for a whopping 5,730 ' hotel room nights ' overall – a number that works out to represent more than 127 separate rooms			1
it 's unclear how much the @entity1 actually spent			0
but the president , it turned out , spent less than 13 hours on the ground in @entity30 on december 10 – arriving and departing on the same day			1
it emerged today for that publicity , the @entity4 administration was prepared to pony up $ 11.5 million the ' beast , ' a one - of - a - kind armored suv that ferries the president around while he 's overseas , was brought to @entity30 for him -- and its operating costs were n't included in the travel estimates no - shows : the @entity46 did not attend @entity7 's actual funeral on dec. 15 , and the @entity48 -- who were on the guest list -- never turned up either it 's also unclear whether he or anyone else checked into either of the two hotels named in the contracting documents			1
neither @entity55 , the rental agency slated to receive the millions for vehicle rental , nor the two hotels named in the @entity1 authorizations – the @entity60 and @entity61 hotels – would comment on whether they provided services to the @entity64 government , or how much they were paid			0
the @entity1 also declined to answer questions about the costs of @entity4 's trip , referring them to the @entity69			2
an administration official told @entity71 that it was ' highly unlikely that anyone will be commenting about the president 's travel arrangements , considering all the security precautions involved			2
' when president and mrs. @entity78 traveled to @entity30 for the @entity7 memorial this month , they traveled with administration officials , dignitaries , secret service details , a @entity64 @entity84 contingent and dozens of journalists : the @entity48 returned on their own after @entity86 departed for @entity87 ; media organizations pay for their correspondents ' travel lexpenses			1
twenty - three members of @entity92 also attended			0
while they traveled on a separate plane , their expenses on the ground were reportedly covered by the @entity1			2
' but federal procurement procedures are what they are , and that 's just a system everyone has to work with			0
' those procedures are notoriously complex and often involve outlining worst - case scenarios , but it 's unlikely anyone would have needed hotel rooms in @entity105 through the middle of january			1
two @entity1 procurement officers failed to respond to requests for comment about how many taxpayer dollars were actually spent on the excursion			0
but they also identified four other hotels that met the security and meeting facility requirements of the @entity69			0
they included a second @entity116 , a @entity117 and a @entity118 , all in central @entity105 near @entity119			0
none of the awards was open to competitive bidding ; the @entity1 cited ' security concerns ' that ' prohibit sufficient advanced notification of vip travel to allow for sufficient time to conduct full and open competition			0
' while @entity7 's death and memorial service unfolded less than a week apart , the @entity30 anti-apartheid icon was in ill health for more than a year , providing @entity1 ample time to plan ahead for contingencies			1
the contract award document for ground transportation noted that the @entity1 conducted a ' limited market survey ' in 2012 , anticipating that it would need logistical support when @entity7 finally succumbed to his illnesses			1
pricey ! when @entity86 took off for @entity30 from @entity140 , it cost the @entity141 nearly $ 180,000 per hour to operate -- costs that also were n't included in the $ 11.5 million travel budget entourage : in addition to the first lady , @entity4 brought along former president @entity147 , former secretary of state @entity148 , and other dignitaries spitting distance : @entity151 , the mentally unbalanced and violent phony sign - language interpreter , got close enough to president @entity4 to do him harm @entity7 was laid to rest at his family home near the @entity30 town of @entity156 on december 15			1
the @entity46 were not slated to attend , but @entity157 and @entity148 were : they were ultimately no - shows			0
rev. @entity159 , a long - time civil rights movement icon and one - time @entity64 presidential candidate , was the most prominent @entity64 guest at the ceremony			0
the contracts were not open to competitive bidding due to the last - minute nature of travel to a foreign country for a head of state 's funeral			0
the president 's unique security requirements when traveling also tend to disqualify most hotels and car services			2
@entity4 's armored limousine and emergency helicopter , for instance , typically travel on a military cargo plane that accompanies @entity86			2
the president 's flagship aircraft itself costs $ 179,750 per hour to operate , according to a @entity182 report published in may 2012			1
somehow the @entity184 's security concerns did n't keep @entity151 , the infamous fake sign - language interpreter , from standing just feet away from the president during his remarks at @entity7 's widely broadcast memorial service			1
@entity151 , who was hospitalized following a reported nervous breakdown on thursday , had a history of mental illness and violent crime leading up to his global moment of fame translating @entity4 's words as ' rocking horses ' and ' shrimp ' as millions of deaf people looked on in disbelief .			0

@entity4 arrived and departed on the same day , spending less than 13 hours on the ground in @entity30 for @entity7 's memorial service
the @entity1 budgeted $ 11,519,617 in three separate contract documents covering ground transportation and *lodging*
hotel rooms were authorized through the middle of january even though @entity7 was laid to rest on december 15
the nearly $ 180,000 - per - hour cost of flying @entity86 , the president 's *customized* @entity213 aircraft , was not part of the cost estimate
