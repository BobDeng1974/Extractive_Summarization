by @entity0 and @entity1 beach lovers and music fans rushed to make the most of the fast - fading sunshine across the country today as @entity7 braced itself for a wet weekend			1
events such as the @entity10 festival in @entity11 got off to a bright start today - but with the threat of looming clouds which were set to put a major dampener on the fun in the coming days			1
forecasters predicted damp conditions sweeping in throughout saturday - while commuters in the capital got an early taste of rain with a wet voyage to work			1
the downpours are set to begin in @entity25 this afternoon before rolling across the sea to the north - west of @entity27 and western @entity11			1
sun - seekers : these bathers decided to catch the last of the warm weather before rain clouds roll in over @entity7 this weekend clouds over sun : sun - worshippers on upmarket @entity36 beach in @entity37 today relaxed under a foreboding sky ahead of a wet weekend crowds : @entity10 revellers made a good start of the festival today , which is due to be headlined by bands including the @entity44 @entity45 : spectators were quick off the mark to reach the festival 's main stage when the gates were opened this morning @entity51 : young fans ( left to right ) @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 leap for joy in front of a festival logo busy weekend ahead : this year will be the festival 's last in its current location by the middle of the weekend they could threaten the rest of the country , with @entity68 and southern @entity27 risking thunderstorms on saturday			1
@entity71 commuters this morning got an early taste of what was to come , as they trudged through the capital in their thousands against incessant showers			1
umbrellas held against the skies , the @entity77 's workers hurried towards their offices , with no great hopes to weekend sun to cheer their moods			1
although many of @entity27 's state school pupils are still set to stare gloomily out of their classroom windows for the best part of a fortnight , a host of private school children were set to finish today , joining @entity11 children who have been on holiday for weeks			1
@entity93 , a forecaster for @entity94 , said : ' today a lot of places are seeing spells of sunshine , but there 's more cloud down in parts of eastern @entity27 with some rain towards the south - east at the moment			1
threats : clouds can be seen in the sky behind these festival - goers at @entity10 in @entity108 , @entity109 @entity110 for now : attendees were looking forward to performances from @entity11 artists including @entity114 and @entity115 indomitable : revellers happily posed for the camera as @entity11 's biggest music festival got underway ' but later today there 's another front that 's going to start coming in from the west , which will introduce some more clouds which will give us bits and pieces of rain in @entity25			1
this evening it will start moving to the @entity122			2
' tomorrow there 's rain moving in to northern and western areas , most persistent in @entity11 , while parts of eastern @entity27 will experience sharp showers and developing thunderstorms			1
' on sunday that rain will sweep its way easterwards overnight			2
it will clear most of the country through sunday morning , except for @entity11 where it will hang on into the afternoon , where it will stay quite wet			1
' the rain will be particularly troubling for those north of the border , where 85,000 revellers at the @entity10 festival faced the uncertain outlook as they prepared to be regaled by @entity11 rockers @entity114 and dj @entity115			1
flying high : revellers from @entity148 , @entity149 ( left ) and across @entity11 celebrated blue skies this morning - which are not set to last happy days : these girls found themselves bathed in some specks of sun today at @entity10 , which are expected to become more scarce as the festival continues chilled out : sunglasses were the order of the day this morning at the festival - but they may not stay that way for long the festival in @entity108 , @entity109 , could be blighted by rain as it gets fully underway			1
though revellers were enjoying dry conditions this morning , by saturday things were set to take a turn for the worse			2
on the festival weather , mr @entity93 said : ' at @entity10 , saturday will have a dry start , but probably around noon we 'll start to see spells of rain moving in from the west			1
' this is likely to turn heavy at times in the afternoon			0
it will stay there through the evening , through the night , and probably into sunday morning as well			0
' @entity27 's cricketing hopes at @entity177 , where the national side is locked in a test match with @entity180 , could also be threatened by the weather			0
as the team started today trailing @entity180 by more than 400 runs , the prospect of a shower over the stadium in @entity185 ' could not be ruled out '			2
and though the sportsmen looked likely to escape the advancing rains on saturday - which will probably hit after play finished - the final day of the test match on sunday risks morning showers before a clearer afternoon			1
the most extreme weather in the country looked to focus on the @entity195 , where thunderstorms are due to batter areas around @entity68 from the late afternoon through to the evening			1
bright start : there were clear skies this morning in @entity200 , @entity201 , but showers were expected later on threatened : showers are set to move in from saturday , dampening the weekend for many across the country disappointing temperatures seemed the order of the day , with highs of just 26 @entity209 expected in areas lucky enough to dodge the rain			1
sunday looked particularly dampened , with national highs of just 22 degrees , amid ' humid ' conditions , forecasters said			0
but despite dampened prospects for the weather in @entity11 , revellers seemed in high spirits and prepared to make the most of the music at @entity10 's last year in its current location			1
@entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 will play to a daily crowd of 85,000 at the three - day event			2
the line - up also includes @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
this year marks the end of an era for @entity10 at the @entity108 airfield , home to the festival for the past 18 years			1
organisers said this weekend 's event will act as a ' huge send - off party ' before a move to the @entity241 estate in @entity242 in 2015			2
performers over the weekend include the headliners of @entity10 's first year at @entity108 - the @entity245 and @entity246 - with both acts taking to the stage 18 years to the day after they performed at the festival 's debut in @entity109			1
showers ahead : commuters walking over @entity253 today had an early taste of the wet weekend to come sodden : city workers did what they could to protect themselves from showers today , while across the country heavy showers , and even thunderstorms , loomed for the weekend gloom : the dampness was set to be shared nationwide , first in the west and north , then more widely out and under : these businesswomen ( left ) sheltered under a single umbrella to escape the rain , while one hardy worker ( right ) ignored the inclement conditions and kept up with his morning run gloomy : @entity271 was framed by rainclouds this morning as commuters trooped its length on their way to work the @entity277 , @entity278 and the @entity279 will also take to the stage			1
the campsite gates opened last night , with crowds turning up early to grab the best spot for the festival , now its 21st year			0
festival director @entity285 said : ' this weekend , we mark the end of an era			2
the @entity108 site has never looked more beautiful , and we 're getting ready to give our much - loved home for the past 18 years the incredible send - off it deserves			2
' we 're really looking forward to celebrating one last time here with the greatest audience in the world , and ca n't wait to welcome you all as we throw @entity108 a farewell party			2
' more than 2,800 artists have played @entity108 over nearly two decades , including @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity306 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity301			2
@entity114 have played the most times , with their main stage headline set tonight taking their total performances there to 10			0
it may be an unenviable weekend ahead for many - but overall the @entity7 summertime has come up trumps for winegrowers , who could win out over rivals in traditional heartlands like @entity318 and @entity319			2
the @entity321 countries have been battered by storm winds and hail over the past months , while growers in @entity27 regions such as @entity326 and @entity327 have boasted of ' perfect ' conditions			0
the onslaught has destroyed up to 80 per cent of some pinot noir and @entity332 crops in @entity333 and led one winemakers ' association to declare the season ' a catastrophe '			0
meanwhile @entity7 growers are set to export record numbers of bottles - and demand has never been higher			0
@entity7 winemaker @entity342 will compete this summer against @entity318 's top champagne producers for the title of international sparkling winemaker of the year after becoming the first @entity346 to reach the final three			0
perfect conditions : winemakers in @entity27 have been enjoying ideal weather - in contrast to @entity318 and @entity319 growers			0
pictured is the @entity354 near @entity355 , @entity326 @entity342 , who owns @entity354 near @entity355 , @entity326 , said : ' we 've had a brilliant year for our wine			0
' if the sun shines , everything flowers and there 's no particularly bad weather between now and october , then we could make up to 200,000 bottles			0
' on a bad year we can make 50,000			0
in @entity27 we accept that we have bad years from time to time but in @entity333 they 'll not be used to having such a bad season			0
vineyard owner @entity364 said @entity27 wine used to be considered a joke by continental rivals but is now good enough to compete globally			0
he said : ' @entity27 wine used to be a bit of a joke			0
the @entity318 , @entity371 and @entity319 - the stereotypical wine - growing countries - would say , " the @entity27 ca n't make wine "			0
growing : the good weather in past months means @entity7 winemarkers are hoping to export more than ever ' some of the pictures i 've seen of the devastation in @entity333 and @entity318 have been absolutely horrific			0
storms can be quite localised and some vines have been completely stripped bare			0
' obviously storms and strong winds are something @entity27 winegrowers are aware of too but it 's just been the right weather at the right time for our wine			0
mr @entity364 runs 16 @entity388 in @entity389 , @entity390 , where he hopes to produce 60,000 bottles from this summer 's crop .			0
