@entity0 claims he has ' unfinished business ' with @entity2 and is of the firm belief they will emerge as @entity6 frontrunners			1
@entity7 have again reunited themselves with @entity2 from this season , with the @entity10 manufacturing giant serving as power - unit supplier , 23 years after the pair last formed a powerful alliance			1
for @entity0 , it was only seven years ago he last worked with @entity2 when they were a fully - fledged team , albeit one that succumbed to the global credit crisis at the end of 2008 as they were forced to withdraw from @entity6			1
@entity19 driver @entity0 of @entity2 steers his @entity20 - 30 @entity0 takes his @entity21 - 30 for a spin during testing in @entity24 @entity0 claims he has ' unfinished business ' with @entity2 who have teamed up with @entity7 @entity26 went on to resurrect the marque from the ashes , forming @entity29 which astonishingly helped @entity0 become drivers ' champion in 2009 , as well claiming the constructors ' crown			1
@entity0 is fully aware of @entity2 's desire to prove themselves again in @entity6 , as they did with @entity7 from 1988 - 1991 when they were virtually unbeatable			1
' we did n't get the results together in ' 07 and ' 08 , so there 's a lot for us to achieve , and to put right if you like , of working together , ' assessed @entity0			2
@entity2 and @entity7 last worked together 23 years ago and @entity0 wants to get the results that count ' we did obviously have some good times , like in 2006 with our win in @entity43 , and at other times we had some very special moments			1
' now we need to build on that , but yes , there is also a lot of unfinished business			0
' it was no surprise @entity2 encountered numerous difficulties during last week 's first pre-season test , completing just six laps on each of the first two days , and 79 over the four in total			0
@entity0 , though , has every confidence @entity2 will not struggle for long given the diligent way they go about their business			2
' i like their philosophy , the way they go racing , ' said @entity0			0
@entity0 tests the corners of his new @entity2 at the winter testing in @entity24 , @entity24 @entity2 do a lap at the @entity66 testing circuit at @entity24 ' as they always say , they build road cars to go motor racing , with the last few years very difficult for them to be out of the sport			1
' but they are here now and they will be strong , and they will give everything to be strong , which is great			0
' @entity0 is not offering excuses , but he feels it was wrong of people to criticise @entity2 's lack of running in @entity24 as they were always going to encounter teething problems being so new to the scene			2
' they have their targets , and they understand what other people are getting out of their engines , and the strengths and weaknesses of those cars , ' added @entity0			0
@entity84 , @entity85 and @entity0 share a joke when @entity0 was representing @entity87 @entity0 and @entity88 share a joke at winter testing in @entity24 , @entity24 ' it 's not like the engine had been driven for three years before the test , and as you know in @entity6 , the cars are only just ready for the first run in winter testing			1
' everything arrives at the last moment because you are trying to get everything out of the car and engine before you arrive at that test			0
' i 'm sure it baffles a lot of people when you see a car turn up at the first test and drive out of the garage at 11am and not 9am			0
why could n't you start two hours earlier ? ' it 's because you are always trying to maximise the winter and arrive at the first test with the best possible package , and that 's why it sometimes starts a little late			0
' @entity0 believes he still has a lot to achieve now he is working with @entity2 again			2
