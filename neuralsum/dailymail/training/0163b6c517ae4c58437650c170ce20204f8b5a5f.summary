@entity1 deputy commissioner @entity0 a deputy police commissioner was forced to quit after attempting to interfere with a murder plot trial , in a bid to stop embarrassing details emerging about a relative ’s love life			1
@entity0 , 32 , tried to use her position to get a judge to stop her cousin ’s name being published as the relative gave evidence about the love triangle that led to her fiance being shot			1
her unauthorised approach could have led to the whole case being abandoned at great cost , prompting police and court officials to step in			1
miss @entity0 , who is also a @entity22 councillor once named @entity23 , was told her position was ‘ untenable ’ and she resigned over the summer			1
but the reason behind her resignation could not be revealed until the trial ended for legal reasons			0
her boss @entity28 , the @entity29 for @entity1 , was under investigation by the police watchdog at the time , after he revealed secret details of a death in custody to his boyfriend			2
he only learned last week that he would not be charged over the unauthorised disclosure			0
miss @entity0 ’s case will add to calls for the unpopular @entity40 , introduced at great cost only two years ago , to be scrapped following a series of scandals			1
in the latest debacle , miss @entity0 almost derailed a @entity46 @entity45 trial in order to spare the blushes of her distant cousin @entity49 , who was at the centre of a love triangle that nearly led to a brutal murder			1
miss @entity49 , who like miss @entity0 lives in @entity46 , had been engaged to accountant @entity53 , 28			1
she also had another suitor , @entity55 , but her family did not approve of the match			2
so the jealous @entity55 hired hitman @entity58 to kill mr @entity53 in what the judge called a ‘ brutal and callous act ’			2
mr @entity53 ’s silver @entity62 was rammed off the road by @entity58 in @entity46 in may 2013			0
when he got out of his car , @entity58 blasted him in the leg with a sawn - off shotgun and although he survived after emergency surgery , he was left with life - changing injuries			0
a trial began in july this year but just before @entity70 was due in the witness box , deputy pcc miss @entity0 contacted the court to ask the judge if her cousin could be granted anonymity to spare her embarrassment			1
although miss @entity49 ’s evidence about her tangled relationships was heard , court officials were so worried that miss @entity0 ’s approach might lead to the trial collapsing that they told police who in turn contacted the @entity100 ’s office – leading to miss @entity0 ’s forced resignation			1
last month @entity55 , 28 , and @entity58 , 41 , of @entity102 , were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life with minimum terms of 15 and 17 years , respectively			2
the verdict means miss @entity0 ’s intervention can now be made public			1
there was no comment last night from @entity70 , mr @entity53 or miss @entity0			1
but a close relation of mr @entity53 said : ‘ i do n’t know why she became involved but most people would do the same			0
‘ it is unfair that @entity49 had her reputation damaged over something that was not her doing so i totally understand why someone would ask the judge about anonymity			2
’ at miss @entity0 ’s home , several male relatives answered the door and said she was ‘ out of the country ’			2
on learning that it was an inquiry from the press , one young man sprinted across the street and tried to pull open the passenger door of @entity131 photographer @entity130 ’s car			0
failing , he went to the driver ’s side and demanded mr @entity130 get out			0
a reporter had his notebook snatched away and only recovered it after a struggle – during which one of the relatives ripped out a page of notes and stuffed them into his own mouth			0
minutes later , six men unsuccessfully tried to stop mr @entity130 ’s car as he drove past			0
mr @entity28 , @entity29 for @entity1 said : ‘ i was informed on july 30 by the police and representatives of the court of concerns about ms @entity0 ’s conduct in relation to an ongoing trial for attempted murder			1
i met with her on july 31 and after discussions we concluded that her position was untenable			0
‘ for sub judice reasons it was not possible to comment on this matter , other than to confirm the resignation , while the trial and any subsequent sentencing were ongoing			0
‘ this issue has been referred to the appropriate authorities and it would therefore be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage			0

@entity0 , 32 , was deputy police commissioner for @entity1
she asked court for @entity172 - her cousin - to not have name published
miss @entity49 was at the centre of a love triangle that nearly led to a murder
her fiance was shot by a hitman hired by a love rival , @entity55
miss @entity0 *'s* intervention could have led to the whole case being abandoned
