by @entity0 a streaker has interrupted proceedings on the annual @entity3 in @entity4			1
a man wearing just a hot - pink ' mankini , ' a chunky gold chain and a smile made a run for the celebrity - strewn red carpet as celebrities preened for photographers			1
at an event for which attendees pay $ 25,000 for a ticket and try to upstage each other with the most fabulous and elaborate gowns , the scantily - dressed exhibitionist was quite a striking sight			0
he reportedly whipped off his tear - away suit and ran for the red carpet , much to the amusement of onlookers			2
unfortunately for him , police managed to intercept the man before his loafer - shod foot reached the hallowed ground			0
according to @entity56 , @entity54 , one of the evening 's hosts , was unperturbed by the interruption			0
red carpet bound : @entity54 in her elaborate @entity60 gown can be seen making her way up the stairs to the top right as the man approaches odd encounter : the suited man appears unsure how to proceed when faced with the nearly nude @entity67 tight security : with so many police around , the streaker 's mission was doomed from the start while he must have felt disappointed to have failed in his nudie mission , the man flashed a smile for cameras as he was hauled off by police			1
it 's not the first time in recent months a streaker has attempted to interrupt a fashion event			2
in february a man who bears a striking resemblance to tonight 's intruder crashed the catwalk at @entity88 's @entity87 show			1
on a streak ? february 's @entity91 runway streaker bears more than a passing resemblance to monday 's @entity3 man in that fashion - streak , the man was clad just in a leopard - print thong , red socks and a gold crown set at a jaunty angle			1
most attendees of tonight 's event took the interruption in stride , but one star will be mightily annoyed			0
@entity105 reportedly skipped the event this year because she was asked not to wear a particularly revealing dress			0
had she taken inspiration from the fashion streaker , she could have worn the outfit of her choice - and saved herself $ 25,000 .			0

a man in a hot - pink ' mankini ' attempted to storm the @entity3 's red carpet in @entity4
as stars such as @entity54 and @entity119 arrived at the event , the man made a run for it
police *tackled* him to the ground just in time
the streaker bears a striking resemblance to the man who crashed the catwalk of the @entity88 show in february
