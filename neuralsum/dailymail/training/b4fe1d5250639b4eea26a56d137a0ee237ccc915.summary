when @entity1 learned that her 14 - year - old daughter had ditched class , she decided to punish her in a way the girl would truly feel : by humiliating her on @entity6			1
with her cell phone recording , the angry mother turned up to her daughter @entity9 's school in @entity11 , @entity12 last week to confront her about playing hooky and then following her to class			1
and once @entity9 conceded that her mother was right , @entity1 uploaded the video to @entity6 - and @entity9 and her siblings vowed never to defy their mother again			1
the video , which @entity1 shared to her @entity6 page , shows her approaching @entity9 outside the school as she walks to class			1
@entity1 uploaded a video of the confrontation to @entity6 ' when was i ditching , mom ? ' the teenager asks			1
' every day this week , ' her mother responds			0
' we 're going to hold hands and we 're going to go to class together			0
is n't it great ? ' as @entity9 refuses to respond to her and storms ahead to class , @entity1 trails her			1
' what 's wrong ? ' she says			0
' you do n't want everyone to know why i 'm here ? you thought it was cute to dicth with your friends ... now let 's see how cute you think is to hang out with mom during class			0
' humiliating : other students look on as @entity48 follows her daughter through the school on the video accepting : @entity9 eventually stops arguing with her mother and has been at every class since finally she corners the girl at a water fountain and @entity9 insists she had only ever been out of class to see the nurse - which her mother says is not the truth			1
' this is what happens when @entity9 ca n't act right , ' her mother said as the girl fell quiet			2
' her mom needs to come to the school and record her to get it through her head			0
i warned you did n't i ? ' after @entity1 shared the video to @entity6 , it has been viewed more than 32,000 times			2
but more importantly to the working single mom - of - three , her daughter 's school attendance has been perfect , she told @entity76			1
' as a single mom , i learned that i have to do double the work			0
i learned to improvise when it comes to my parenting , ' she told @entity76			0
thankful : @entity9 , pictured with her mother right , said she is grateful that her mother cares so much about her , while @entity1 said that , as a single mother of three , sometimes she has to improvise ' her attitude has changed			1
she was asked [ by a friend ] if she wanted to ditch school yesterday , and she told the person no. the thought of mom following her again was nâ€™t appealing			0
' even though some viewers called the treatment cruel , @entity9 took it well			0
' it just goes to show that my mom cares , ' @entity9 told @entity93			2
@entity1 's other two children also found the video funny			2
' as far as my youngest , she says she will never skip school ever , ' @entity1 said .			0

@entity1 learned that her daughter @entity9 had skipped classes and went to her school in @entity11 , @entity12 to confront her
in a video of the confrontation , she follows her through the *hallways* and tells her she *'ll* be *joining* her in class to make sure she gets there
@entity9 has since said she is thankful her mother cares so much - and her mother said the girl 's attendance has been steady since the video
