@entity0 pictured with @entity2 in 2007			1
a letter seen by the @entity7 shows the then prime minister told the dictator he was ' very disappointed ' @entity11 's courts had blocked the deportation of five @entity14 dissidents it was sent following a period in which @entity11 colluded with @entity5 to hand over terror suspects via the @entity31 ’s unlawful rendition programme and @entity32 allowed @entity2 ’s spies to carry out covert operations against dissidents on @entity11 soil			1
@entity11 intelligence agents had also allegedly been complicit in a secret policy of ‘ torture by proxy ’ by providing questions for feared @entity14 interrogators to ask detainees			2
lawyers acting for the men have claimed in court that information illegally extracted from prisoners in @entity5 ’s torture dungeons was central to the @entity11 ’s case for deportation			1
number 10 ’s extraordinary letter will raise fresh questions about the full extent of the @entity57 ’s involvement in the abuse of terror suspects – and fuel speculation that responsibility for the scandal went right to @entity18 ’s door			1
mr @entity0 has repeatedly insisted he opposes torture and has never condoned its use			0
he sent the two - page letter , seen by the @entity7 , on april 26 , 2007 , the day before judges ruled the five men , all linked to the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , which claimed responsibility for a failed assassination attempt on @entity2 in 1996 , could not be deported			1
in a letter on @entity18 - headed paper , mr @entity0 thanked the despot personally for @entity5 ’s ‘ excellent co-operation ’ in the controversial attempt to return the political exiles into the ruthless regime ’s clutches political protocol dictates the prime minister should read the judgement before it was made public			1
on april 27 , the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) blocked the deportation saying a @entity85 signed by @entity11 and @entity5 to safeguard the protection of returning dissidents was worthless			1
@entity2 was ‘ unpredictable ’ and would ignore it , they said			0
they also expressed concern that a so - called independent board set up to monitor deportees ’ treatment was to be run by @entity2 ’s son @entity94 and , therefore , there was a ‘ real risk ’ of them being ill - treated , including being beaten , hung from hooks on the wall , shackled and given electric shocks			2
mr @entity0 ’s letter of apology began with the handwritten words ‘ @entity105 ’ , then continued in type : ‘ i trust that you , and your family , are well			2
’ the letter , sent on official @entity18 - headed paper , was posted following a period in which @entity11 colluded with @entity5 to hand over terror suspects via the @entity31 ’s unlawful rendition programme report : how the story was covered in yesterday 's @entity7			1
mr @entity0 has repeatedly insisted he opposes torture and has never condoned its use referring to the failed legal bid , he wrote : ‘ with regret , i should let you know that the @entity11 government has not been successful in its recent court case here involving deportation to @entity5			1
i am very disappointed at the @entity124 ’s decision			0
’ mentioning the worryingly close relationship between @entity11 and @entity5 , he said : ‘ i believe that it is essential that this decision is not allowed to undermine the effective bilateral co-operation which has developed between the @entity11 and @entity5 in recent years			2
’ he added : ‘ finally , i would like to add a personal word of thanks for your assistance in the matter of deportation			0
that support – and the excellent co-operation of your officials with their @entity11 colleagues – is a tribute to the strength of the bilateral relationship which has grown up between the @entity11 and @entity5			1
’ at the bottom of the letter , which is headed with the @entity18 seal , he hand - wrote : ‘ best wishes , yours ever , @entity0			1
‘ mr @entity0 ’s ( pictured left leaving the @entity146 last week ) letter of apology began with the handwritten words ‘ @entity105 ’ , then continued in type : ‘ i trust that you , and your family , are well ' on the same day , sir @entity153 , mr @entity0 ’s foreign policy adviser , sent a rueful letter to ambassador @entity155 , a key @entity2 aide , apologising for the ‘ very disappointing ’ decision			1
criticising the court ’s assessment of the regime ’s brutality , he said : ‘ unfortunately , some material in the judgement will make uncomfortable reading for the @entity14 authorities			2
‘ we regret this very much , not least in the view of the full co-operation you have given us so promptly and consistently on this issue			0
’ ‘ in particular , during the case , lawyers for the men referred to public statements made by the @entity175			0
’ @entity2 routinely referred to dissidents in exile as ‘ stray dogs ’			2
sir @entity153 added : ‘ this led unavoidably to debate about the position and role of the leader			0
’ last night @entity185 critics condemned the letter			0
sir @entity153 , mr @entity0 ’s foreign policy adviser , sent a rueful letter to a key @entity2 aide , apologising for the ‘ very disappointing ’ decision @entity190 , @entity191 @entity11 ’s head of government affairs , said : ‘ our government should never have been trying to deport men back to @entity5 when there was a clear risk they ’d end up in one of the country ’s torture dungeons			1
‘ rather than cosying up to @entity2 like this , @entity0 should have held firm to the principle that people should not be bundled onto planes and delivered into the hands of their torturers			2
’ @entity208 mp @entity207 said : ‘ this is ghastly			0
the more revelations that come out about @entity0 ’s premiership , the more distasteful it seems			2
he seems to have no regard for basic human rights , civil values or morality			0
‘ how can he live with himself ? i am ashamed that the @entity11 could apologise for not sending people to a country where they would almost certainly be imprisoned and tortured			0
’ @entity219 , a director at human rights charity @entity220 , said : ’ @entity0 must now urgently explain whether he knew the ‘ cooperation ’ mentioned in this fawning message involved kidnap , rendition and torture by his government			0
thankfully , @entity11 today is not @entity2 ’s @entity5 – not even former prime ministers are above the law			1
’ @entity11 sought to bring @entity5 , responsible for the @entity230 bombing and murdering policewoman @entity231 , out of the international deep - freeze in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 to help tackle @entity237 extremists			2
in return , @entity2 hoped intelligence sharing would help him round up and imprison @entity14 who were living in exile in the @entity11			1
to do this , he played up links between the @entity69 and @entity243			0
in february 2004 , @entity5 wrote to @entity244 with a list of 130 dissidents , including the five in @entity11			2
a crackdown began the following month after mr @entity0 cosied up to the tyrant as part of the infamous ‘ deal in the desert ’			0
over the next 12 months , @entity11 spies sent ‘ detailed dossiers ’ of questions about the men to @entity253 authorising regime henchmen to put them to detainees allegedly under torture			0
following the july 7 bombings in @entity261 , which killed 52 , the men were arrested and told they would be deported as ‘ threats to national security ’ , even though they were innocent of the atrocity			0
@entity208 mp @entity207 described the revelations as ' ghastly ' and added that he is ' ashamed ' but after spending nearly two years in detention , immigration judges ruled they could not be deported because they would be ill - treated			0
a spokesman for @entity0 said : ‘ for the avoidance of doubt , @entity0 has always been opposed to the use of torture ; has always said so publicly and privately ; has never condoned its use and – as is shown by internal government documentation already made public – thinks it is totally unacceptable			0
‘ he believes the fight against radical @entity278 is a fight about values and acting contrary to those values – as in the use of torture – is therefore not just wrong but counter-productive			0

@entity0 sent letter to @entity2 on official @entity18 - headed paper
said he was disappointed courts blocked deportation of @entity14 dissidents
thanked him for @entity5 's ' excellent co-operation ' in attempt to return exiles
