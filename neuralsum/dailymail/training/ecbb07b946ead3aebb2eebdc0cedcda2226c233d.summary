by @entity0 follow @ @ martin_domin the prospect of @entity2 ever meeting @entity3 in the centre of a ring suffered another blow after the @entity7 extended his contract with promoter @entity9			1
@entity3 has committed himself to @entity12 ’s outfit until the end of 2016 , by which time he will be 38 and surely considering retirement			1
the eight - division world champion ’s fights are shown on @entity17 in @entity18 while @entity19 is contracted to rival @entity20 , meaning a fight between the two is highly unlikely			1
@entity12 , however , claimed the $ 300million mega-fight could still happen			0
‘ we want to fight him and we ’re willing to discuss it at any point , ’ he said			0
‘ there are two ways to go here			0
one is to do a @entity19 fight with both @entity17 and @entity20 involved , as they did with @entity41 , as i understand @entity19 is under contract to @entity20 through 2015			1
the companies could come together and put on the show			0
‘ or , the other alternative is , if @entity2 wanted to fight @entity3 in 2016 , he could return to @entity17 and we could do it there			2
’ veteran : @entity3 is now contracted to @entity9 until 2016 when he will be 38 - years - old a further obstacle to the fight is the fractured relationship between @entity12 and @entity52 ceo @entity52			1
@entity19 has worked with @entity52 since 2007 and has previously stated his loyalty to @entity52			0
the 37 - year - old will return to the ring on september 13 having outpointed @entity56 in @entity57 earlier this month			0
@entity3 , meanwhile , could fight @entity58 for a fifth time in @entity60 in november			2

@entity3 commits to promoter @entity9 until 2016 when he will be 38
