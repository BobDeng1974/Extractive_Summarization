' it was a jokey comment but it stuck in my head			0
i came up with a catchy name and the rest is history			0
famous fan : @entity18 likes to challenge the body in ways you would n't conventionally see			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) doing upside down burpees against a wall is one of those ways just whip it : model @entity3 uploaded a video of her in the class to her @entity65 account ' there 's nothing skinny about @entity12			1
we are plump with female empowerment and re-education in a world saturated with misconceptions about fitness and health			2
' @entity3 is said to love the class , which has attendees crawling on their hands and knees and doing one legged burpees , because it helps her ' release her inner animal '			1
@entity18 , who has been a trainer for eight years and established the @entity12 project last year , said of his class : ' i fuse traditional movements with more extreme movements and exercises that ' you would n't have done since a kid			1
quirky techniques : @entity18 ( left ) has girls crawling into each other and carrying each other on their backs ( right ) to challenge their bodies ' i have girls crawling into each other and carrying each other on their backs			1
this can challenge the body in ways you would n't conventionally see			2
@entity2 doing upside down burpees against a wall for example is a strange sight obviously ! '			1
thanks to his celebrity clientele who ca n't stop raving about him , @entity18 is in very high demand and selective about who he will train			2
he has a huge waiting list and his saturday classes are invite - only			2
' you have to be a nice person with a good heart and work your socks off - no time for negativity , ' he says of the selection process model friends : @entity18 has joined forces with @entity117 , the nutritionist behind website @entity118 ( pictured , left , with model @entity4 ) he has recently launched online training classes and diet programmes formulated by @entity117 , the nutritionist behind website model @entity124 , who happens to be @entity127 's with @entity128 and @entity129			1

i 've trained with him a handful of times over the last few months and the man is a fitness genius			0
to say he works you hard is an understatement but the results speak for themselves			0
there 's no danger of reaching an exercise plateau either as he 's continually inventing new methods of torture to mix things up and a single session can have you running against the wall while performing a semi-handstand , executing single leg burpies and primal crawling wearing an exercise band			0
he 's big on the holistic approach too - both in terms of the fuel you put into your body and also in the way he encourages collaboration within the collective - from model @entity117 and her inspired @entity202 recipe blog to hip exercise gear designer @entity203 and jewellery - designer - meets - health - writer , @entity206			2
