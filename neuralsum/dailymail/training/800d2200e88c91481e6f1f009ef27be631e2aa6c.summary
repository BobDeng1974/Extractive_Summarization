@entity0 has issued a ringing endorsement of @entity3 ’s regime			1
the @entity5 manager made headlines this week as he enforced a stringent approach to fitness and diet			1
seen in some quarters as a criticism of the reign of predecessor @entity13 , an unrepentant @entity3 insisted that any player not buying into his methods would soon be surplus to requirements			1
but having helped the @entity21 champions move joint top of their @entity24 group with a narrow win over @entity26 , @entity19 defender @entity18 stressed the squad were prepared to go to any lengths to improve their chances of competing at the highest level			1
@entity0 has been in impressive form for @entity5 and helped his side to a win over @entity26 ‘ it ’s good for us all , it ’s not something that makes you worse or anything else			1
he wants to make us better players and wants to get everything out of us , ’ @entity18 said			1
‘ i think that ’s a good sign			2
but he is also busy trying to win games and that ’s the most important thing in football			2
’ asked if the strict diet @entity3 is imposing was something he ’d experienced in @entity48 , @entity18 replied : ‘ no , but i think if you play at the highest level then you should look into it			1
if you want to play at the highest level and get everything out of yourself then , of course , you need to do what it takes			2
‘ diet and fitness are important			2
but the most important thing is to win games			0
‘ it ’s his ( @entity3 ’s ) opinion			1
he ’s the gaffer and he wants us to do it			0
that ’s his right and i think it will only make us better human beings and better players			0
’ the mutual respect between player and manager was apparent again yesterday when @entity3 described @entity18 as the ‘ perfect defender ’			1
@entity18 stressed the squad were prepared to go to any lengths to improve their chances of competing and he urged the towering centre half to hold fire for a major @entity77 club after @entity5 resisted offers from @entity79 and @entity80 in the last transfer window			1
@entity3 insisted the sky is the limit for his £ 9million rated @entity18 and said : ‘ @entity0 is better now and improves all the time			1
he looks fit and sharp and for me i hope when he leaves @entity5 he goes to a top international club and we ’re talking about one that could win the @entity89			2
‘ i do n’t have so much experience of those things , but in my opinion if he gets consistency in his play and is even more disciplined in his structure i ca n’t see his weaknesses			0
‘ he ’s quick , he ’s strong , he ’s good on the ball , he ’s calm , he reads the play well , he ’s good in the air			0
you name it , he has everything			0
‘ he is the perfect defender			0
but he is his own enemy , he has to step up every day and go to training to get even better but i think he is improving all the time			0
’ @entity104 on - loan at @entity5 from @entity105 has been called up to the @entity107 squad @entity3 is also delighted with @entity104 ’s call - up to the @entity107 squad for the forthcoming @entity110 ties with @entity111 and @entity112 – and hopes it can help to keep the @entity105 loan star for one more season			1
‘ you see what it does to have a good environment and work in the right way , this is what you can get out of players , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s something i learn and you learn when you get into a big club			0
‘ it ’s about getting the best out of the players and with @entity104 we have done that			2
‘ i hope that we can build him up but also keep him for the @entity89 if we win the league and get into the @entity89 next year - that he can be an important player in that role as well			0
‘ we have a very good co-operation with @entity105 , there are good bonds there			2
he is very young still to be playing at this level and if we win the league and go into the @entity89 it would be a perfect scenario for him because it is a very high level and he maybe needs a couple of years there			0
they are happy with what is happening here with him			0
