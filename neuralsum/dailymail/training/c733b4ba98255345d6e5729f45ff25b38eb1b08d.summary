trying in vain to cram clothes for all weather conditions into a suitcase before juggling it on a set of scales to check the weight is a scene familiar to many holiday - goers			1
but a new product aims to simplify the process with in - built scales , travel tips and much more - and it will even lock itself when you walk away			2
called @entity16 the carry - on suitcase syncs with an app to provide a host of data for travellers in an attempt to make their journey easier			2
the product syncs with an app to provide a host of functionality including a digital lock , distance alerts , location tracking and statistics on your previous trips @entity16 was designed by a team from @entity25 who are currently seeking funding on @entity41 for the project			1
it connects wirelessly via @entity44 with a user 's phone allowing them to lock , unlock , weigh , locate and track the suitcase @entity16 is available for £ 120 ( $ 195 ) now for early backers on @entity41 and the team expects to begin shipping in august next year			1
it is 21.5 ” x 14 ” x 9 inches ( 54.6 x 35.6 x 22.9cm ) in size - approved by all airlines to carry on - and weighs 8.5lbs ( 3.8kg ) @entity53 : users can lock and unlock the suitcase from the phone app. the proximity sensors automatically lock the bag when it is separated from the user			1
@entity60 : users are able to see the exact weight of the suitcases on the app and whether it ’s approved by the airline to carry on			0
@entity67 : users are notified on their smartphones via @entity70 when they are leaving their suitcases behind , avoiding losses or thefts			0
location tracking : with gps technology @entity16 tracks the location of the suitcase and helps you find it when lost or re-routed			2
trip stats and data : users are able to see trends in their travel habits ( miles travelled , airports visited , time per state / country ) and sync with other services for smart notifications and reminders			0
battery charger : users can recharge their electronic devices up to six times while on the go			0
a built - in battery charger can also be used to fully charge devices six times over			1
entering your flight details in the app will provide you with numerous updates on your flight such as its current status			2
the app will also check the weather at your destination and tell you the sorts of things you 'll need to pack			0
lifting up the handle , meanwhile , will activate the scales that are built into the suitcase – - with the weight displayed on the app. a lock and unlock feature is also built into the suitcase ; proximity sensors detect if you have walked away and automatically lock it when you ’re not nearby			1
another bugbear of travellers is the moment a bag gets re-routed , leaving the person stranded in a new destination with none of their belongings			0
the location software in the suitcase , though , shows you where the bag is at any given moment so it can be found when lost or re-routed			0
users can also see their travel habits including miles travelled , airports visited and time spent in each country with the app. ' we came up with the idea for @entity16 after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage , when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost , ' said @entity142 , co-founder of @entity16			0
' we realised that with all the amazing technology available today , we could do better			0
' suitcases have n’t seen much innovation in decades , so we decided to design a suitcase for this century			0
' proximity sensors lock the suitcase when they detect you have walked away , or it can also be locked manually through the app ( shown )			1
@entity151 tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight , and a built - in battery can charge your smartphone six times over lifting the handle activates interior scales that weigh the suitcase ( shown )			1
it will also give you tips on what clothes to take to your destination			2
the team are currently seeking £ 31,000 ( $ 50,000 ) on @entity41 for @entity16 , and they expect to start shipping in august 2015			1
