dozens of babies have died after contracting meningitis while the government has been haggling over the cost of a vaccine to prevent the disease			1
@entity8 scientists recommended in march that the vaccine should be given routinely to all infants to protect them against meningitis b , which affects more than 600 people a year , but mostly those under the age of five			1
but eight months on , despite the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) recommending @entity17 , the @entity15 has not been able to agree a price with makers @entity19 – with negotiations only beginning in august			1
@entity22 - @entity21 from @entity23 , who turns one this week ( pictured left and right ) contracted meningitis b and had to have both her legs and arms amputated last week @entity28 said he wanted to find a ‘ cost - effective way ’ of making the @entity8 the first country in the world with a national meningococcal b vaccine			1
but top doctors said the ‘ unacceptable ’ delay is costing lives – and that the death toll will accelerate over the winter			1
according to the charity @entity39 , around 20 babies have died of meningitis b since march			1
the bacterial infection can cause septicaemia , which can be deadly and lead to limb loss			0
it can also cause brain damage			0
young children are most susceptible because their immune systems are not fully developed , although anyone can die from it			0
around 400 people have been infected since the spring			0
dr @entity51 , a paediatrician and clinical adviser to the @entity53 , feared ministers were letting the ‘ historic ’ opportunity to all but eradicate the last major type of bacterial meningitis from @entity8 pass			1
she said : ‘ we have come to this historic moment , where we have a vaccine to protect against meningitis b , which now accounts for the lion ’s share of cases			1
but now we are fudging it			0
’ @entity67 's family - including her parents @entity68 and @entity70 , pictured - said it was heartbreaking to know the young girl 's suffering could have been spared through the licensed vaccine among the most recent victims of the disease is @entity77 from @entity23 , who turns one this week			2
in september her parents @entity68 , 20 , and @entity70 , 22 , celebrated her first steps			2
but weeks later they were left devastated after being told by doctors at the @entity80 that she had contracted meningitis			1
it caused such extensive septicaemia that she had to have both her arms and legs amputated			1
@entity67 ’s aunt @entity88 , 31 , said it was heartbreaking that a licensed vaccine existed which could have spared her such suffering			2
@entity67 's case was mentioned in the @entity93 this week in a plea to @entity28 she said : ‘ the family feel like @entity67 ’s whole life has been robbed			2
had this vaccine been made publicly available there is a strong likelihood she would not be in this position			2
’ conservative mp for @entity103 , @entity102 , brought up @entity67 ’s case as he made his plea to mr @entity28 in the @entity105 during prime minister ’s questions on wednesday			0
‘ thirty babies die of this [ disease ] a year			2
much more worryingly , 300 babies are severely maimed , ’ mr @entity102 said			2
‘ there is a licensed and safe vaccine available			0
’ mr @entity28 replied : ‘ i ’m certainly keen to help if i can			0
but as [ mr @entity102 ] says , there are issues , which is why ... we ’re having discussions with the producer of this vaccine to see if we can find a cost - effective way of doing this			0
’ @entity123 was licensed in the @entity8 22 months ago			0
studies show it is 95 per cent effective , after the recommended three doses			0
at its @entity129 ‘ list price ’ of £ 75 a jab , it would cost £ 225 to give each child three doses , meaning the programme would cost £ 150 million annually			0
the @entity16 said it should only be introduced if a cost - effective price is achieved			0
however , it is understood @entity19 has been willing to offer a substantial discount			1
no one from @entity19 was willing to comment last night			1
however a @entity15 spokesman said that the ‘ proper procurement rules ’ had to be followed , and officials had been working through the process ‘ as quickly as we can ’			1
he added : ‘ we are continuing our negotiations to agree a cost - effective price			0

scientists said infants should have vaccine to protect against meningitis b
but the @entity15 has not agreed price with makers @entity19
doctors said delay is costing life with death toll *expected* to rise over winter
