@entity1 police are hunting a mysterious gang that has terrorised @entity4 motorists in recent months with a series of murders resembling the violent video game @entity8 the gang - dubbed the @entity8 gang by @entity1 media after the video game that involves gangland - style robberies and killings - is believed to have killed about 15 people			1
in the dead of night , the gang members place metal spikes on roads just outside @entity4 to burst the tyres of passing cars , then ruthlessly gun down their drivers and disappear			1
among their victims are a policeman , a senior banker , and even a former dancer from a famous folk dancing troupe			1
in a sign of how seriously the crimes are being treated , the police have teamed up with the @entity31 security agency , the successor to the @entity33 , to tackle the murders and president @entity35 has gotten personally involved			1
@entity1 media have nicknamed the group after the game ' essentially , this crime is terrorist by nature , ' @entity35 told interior minister @entity56 late last week			1
' i know you are working together with the security services , with the @entity31			2
i hope you will see this through			0
' @entity56 reported to @entity35 after law enforcement agencies reportedly caught several members of the gang , and the @entity1 strongman commended police for ' solving ' the crime			1
but investigators and police have been unusually tight - lipped about the case , and the vast mystery shrouding the crimes and the hunt for the attackers has bred a wealth of eyebrow - raising theories			2
@entity79 newspaper @entity78 , citing law enforcement sources , said the gang did not gun people down for money			1
the gang calls itself ' jaamat ' ( group in @entity85 ) and is on a mission to hunt down ' infidels , ' said the government mouthpiece			1
according to another popular version , the attackers are militants affiliated with islamists who are using the roads around @entity4 as a training ground to prepare to join their cause in @entity95 or elsewhere			0
@entity96 , the leader of the ultra-nationalist @entity97 , pointed the finger at @entity100 who are fighting a @entity4 - backed separatist uprising - and , the @entity104 and @entity105 say , @entity1 troops - in eastern @entity100			1
' this is the work of professional subversive elements from @entity100			0
they are taking revenge on us , ' said @entity96			0
@entity112 ran from his car when he realised his tyres had been slashed but the 53 - year - old was gunned down @entity116 , the founder of @entity118 website that tracks the security services , said the case seemed utterly bizarre			2
' there are too many sensationalist leads - @entity100 , @entity91 , ' he said			0
' these are so easy to use for propaganda purposes			0
' after refusing to comment for days , the @entity125 , which reports directly to @entity35 , broke its silence on wednesday , saying it had already arrested the first suspects			0
one of the gang leaders put up armed resistance and was killed , the @entity125 said in a statement , referring to the gang as the ' so - called @entity8			1
' ' investigators established that when killing people , gang members were guided only by motives of profit , stealing their victims ' money , ' it said			1
investigators said that ' the hypothesis that members of the gang were mimicking the @entity8 computer game has not been proven			1
' the arrests apparently came as part of a major operation in which law enforcement agencies rounded up a group of guest workers from @entity150 last week			1
according to law enforcement leaks reported in @entity1 media , the suspected ringleader of the gang was shot dead near @entity4 as he tried to attack police with a hand grenade			1
in the latest twist , investigators said thursday that one of the ringleaders had rented a house from a senior official in the prosecutor - general 's office			2
a map of the attacks dotted around the @entity4 region shows how dispersed the group 's violence has been a huge cache of arms and ammunition are believed to have been recovered from the house			2
political analyst @entity174 chalked up the secrecy surrounding the case to its extreme sensitivity			0
' this case is explosive , ' @entity174 said			0
' the authorities will do anything to avoid ethnic clashes			0
these can be exploited by ultra-right nationalists to call for the persecution of migrants			0
' @entity190 tensions have risen dramatically in @entity1 this year , fuelled by a @entity4 - based separatist uprising in @entity100 , @entity188 sanctions and growing unemployment			2
@entity35 has repeatedly slammed attempts to inflame nationalist sentiments , evoking the country 's multi-ethnic , multi-confessional history			1
many insist the investigators have detained the wrong people , or are not telling the entire story			0
a group of volunteer vigilantes - some armed with handguns - have organised regular patrols along the roads near @entity4 in a bid to nab the killers			2
opposition newspaper @entity209 , seen as a thorn in the @entity212 's side , urged its readers to help solve the crime			2
@entity215 , a journalist investigating the gang for @entity209 , said he found the investigators ' statements puzzling			0
' it was said before the bandits had not been taking their victims ' belongings , ' he said			0
' i still believe that the @entity8 gang is at large , ' he added			0
' people , you must be vigilant			0

the groups ' victims *include* a policeman , a banker and famous folk dancer
@entity1 police have teamed up with country 's internal security agency
group has been called the ' @entity239 ' named after the violent game
the gang uses road spikes to disable cars then they gun down the driver
