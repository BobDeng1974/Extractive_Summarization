@entity0 convert - who threatened a caretaker because he let tourists into a mosque with their heads uncovered - hails from a devoutly @entity7 family this is the face of the @entity0 fanatic who made legal history as the first woman to go on trial wearing the niqab			1
@entity14 , 22 – whose refusal to remove the full face covering has caused controversy – is pictured here for the first time , dressed in a casual t - shirt			1
the image can finally be revealed after she dramatically admitted witness intimidation yesterday			0
her guilty plea followed a six - day trial during which a judge controversially allowed her to wear the niqab after ruling that the court should recognise ‘ freedom of religious expression ’			1
today it can be disclosed that the @entity0 convert – who threatened a caretaker because he let tourists into a mosque with their heads uncovered – hails from a devoutly @entity7 family and started wearing the veil only as recently as 2012 after being radicalised by a ‘ @entity0 vigilante ’			2
pictures taken six years ago show her as a carefree teenager enjoying listening to music and dancing with her relatives			0
but just a few years later , she shocked family members by turning up at the funeral of her grandmother @entity45 wearing a burka			0
her great uncle , @entity48 , said her @entity50 - born grandmother worked as a nurse at the @entity52 in @entity53 and raised her family as strict @entity7			0
‘ my sister @entity55 would turn in her grave if she knew how @entity14 was carrying on , ’ he added			2
‘ @entity55 was very religious , a committed church - goer			0
’ mr @entity48 ’s wife @entity58 said : ‘ i ’m horrified and angry that a woman wants to put on an @entity61 veil			0
that is like going backwards in women ’s rights			0
i really ca n’t understand it at all			0
’ @entity64 claimed her religion prevented her removing the veil in the presence of men brought up in a broken and violent household , @entity64 had a chaotic childhood that may give an insight into her rejection of @entity75 values			1
born in @entity77 in 1991 , the jobless @entity0 fanatic is the fifth of six children			0
her father , @entity80 , 54 , was released from prison last year after serving a five - year sentence for trying to smuggle £ 100,000 worth of cannabis into the @entity85 from @entity86			0
this week , @entity87 heard how @entity64 had recruited her brother @entity88 to help her frighten a caretaker at @entity90 in @entity91 because he had let three @entity93 charity workers into the building on june 4 last year			1
@entity64 refused to give evidence during a four - day trial with her brother @entity88 , 32 , after being ordered by the judge to remove her veil if she went into the witness box she confronted caretaker @entity102 , saying : ‘ why are you inviting naked women in the mosque ? ’ a fight broke out after her husband @entity107 , 23 , intervened			1
terrified , mr @entity102 reported him to the police			0
two weeks later , @entity64 returned to the mosque – where hate preacher @entity112 famously disseminated his poisonous beliefs – accompanied by her brother to challenge mr @entity102			1
she asked him : ‘ why did you tell the police my husband is threatening to kill you ? ’ this led to her trial for witness intimidation , during which she was allowed to wear her veil – to the fury of open justice campaigners			1
judge @entity127 insisted she remove her niqab to give her evidence			1
she changed her plea to guilty today after a jury of six men and six women failed to reach a verdict against her and her brother during the extraordinary case , @entity14 ’s identity had to be verified by police officers throughout her trial			1
she was allowed to wear the veil , which showed just her eyes , after her barrister @entity141 argued in a pre-trial hearing last september that she had a right to do so under the @entity144			0
it meant that a female police officer , who had been present when @entity64 had her photograph taken after she was arrested last june , repeatedly had to go to a private room at @entity87 with the defendant – who would lift her veil to confirm her identity			2
judge @entity127 originally said last september that @entity64 would have to remove the veil before she even entered a plea to the single charge of witness intimidation			1
but he relented after miss @entity141 cited human rights laws and said forcing @entity64 to remove the niqab would be counter to @entity85 ’s ‘ tolerant ’ approach to @entity61 dress			2
judge @entity127 ruled @entity64 could wear the veil while sitting in the dock , however he claimed it was crucial for jurors to be able to see the defendant ’s face if they gave evidence at trial			1
he said @entity64 would have to remove the veil if she took to the witness box			1
but she waived that right during the trial , which meant that the jury did not see her face at all during the six - day hearing			2
during his summing up , the judge told the jury to put aside any prejudices that they may have about the niqab			2
he said : ‘ this is not a ruling about religion			0
it is about the ability of the court to hear a fair trial			0
’ but @entity64 ’s lawyer attempted to challenge his decision , arguing that forcing her to remove the veil to give evidence violated her right to a fair trial			1
when judge @entity127 rejected this challenge and invited her to remove the veil in front of the jury of six women and men , @entity64 refused			1
she later declined to give evidence , claiming it was against her religious beliefs to show her face to men			1
the jury were discharged at the end of the trial after failing to reach a verdict , despite deliberating for more than 12 hours			1
facing the prospect of a retrial , @entity64 admitted her guilt , but only after making a deal with prosecutors that the case against her 32 - year - old brother @entity88 – who was facing the same charge – would be dropped			2
last night dr @entity218 , director of think - tank @entity219 , said it was wrong that @entity64 had been allowed to wear the veil in court			2
‘ this really makes a mockery of the justice system , ’ he said			0
‘ i do not think she should have been allowed to wear the veil at all during the trial			2
‘ it weakens the extent to which the court is doing justice because it ’s not just a matter of looking at someone ’s face when they give evidence			1
‘ that ’s an important part of the jury ’s judgement and this may be why the jury was unable to reach a verdict in this case			2
’ @entity246 , executive director of the @entity247 , wrote to the @entity248 last year about the case			0
he said : ‘ justice can only be done where jurors can observe the demeanour of defendants and witnesses , not just when giving evidence but throughout the trial			0
‘ the justice authorities must act quickly to make sure that this trial is not used as a precedent to permit full face veils			0
‘ we further regret the significant wasted court time on this issue			0
