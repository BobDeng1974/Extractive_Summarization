@entity1 's older brother @entity0 claims the striker has been brainwashed by @entity4 spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch			1
@entity0 , 42 , a truck driver based in @entity9 , @entity10 , told @entity11 on sunday : ' [ @entity1 ] has been brainwashed by these @entity14 alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well			1
' they have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him			0
my mother is very sad			0
every day she is crying			0
i just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again			0
@entity24 is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of @entity42 tradition			2
@entity1 was recently moved to deny accusations from his sister @entity44 that he had kicked their mum @entity46 out of his house in @entity35 because he thought she had performed @entity24 curses on him			1
@entity44 claimed on radio station @entity49 in neighbouring @entity50 that the @entity52 striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year			1
she said their mum was selling ' polythene bags , padlocks and other things ' to provide for her family however @entity1 says his mother left the house of her own accord			1
@entity1 , speaking to @entity49 , said : ' i never sacked my mum from the house			1
she decided to leave the house			0
' how am i going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward , so i will just be on my side and do my thing			2
listen to the full interview at @entity72 ' they should stop talking , they should stop doing @entity24 on me , they should leave me alone			2
' i bought a $ 1.2m house in @entity77 for the one talking and calling herself my sister			0
can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge ? ' @entity0 tells @entity11 that he sends @entity46 euros a month			2
he says he is ' angry ' at his brother and that @entity1 's financial snub has ' left our family in poverty '			1
while it 's common for people who identify as @entity91 such as @entity1 to visit a @entity14 spiritual healer , @entity0 says the @entity31 front man is ' seeing bad alfas and they are manipulating him '			1
' if you are really a man of @entity96 then you have to catch our mother and prove she is a witch , ' he says			0
' otherwise you are just lying to @entity1 and taking his money			2
' @entity31 has been contacted for a response			2
@entity1 's form for @entity31 has n't been tested since november 9 , when he was a 65th - minute substitute for @entity102 in their 2 - 1 loss to @entity105			1
after that match @entity1 criticised @entity31 fans for not providing a supportive atmosphere at @entity109			1
the 30 - year - old is in contention to start against @entity112 at the @entity113 on sunday ' it might be better to play away at the moment , ' he said			0
' at least you know you are going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing , rather than our own fans			0
' @entity31 @entity123 member @entity122 hit back at @entity1 in the @entity124 , saying : ' are players not playing well because of booing or is the booing because players are not playing well ? ' ' it 's a bit of both			1
@entity1 is a player on £ 170,000 a week			0
we know that he needs to be loved			0
but it does seem a little bit rich to be complaining that people paying between £ 50 and £ 80 to watch a single game are not being massively supportive when it does n't appear as if all the time he is putting the effort in			0
' @entity1 has scored just twice in 12 appearances this campaign with his last goal coming in @entity31 ' 2 - 1 loss at home to @entity142 in which his side could n't capitalise on 67 per cent of the possession .			1
