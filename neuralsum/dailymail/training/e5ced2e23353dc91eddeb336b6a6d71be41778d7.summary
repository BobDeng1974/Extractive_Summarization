she has admitted , much to her irritation , that she is better known for ‘ getting her kit off ’ than her award - winning performances on screen and stage			2
but it seems dame @entity8 just ca n’t help herself			1
@entity9 , director of the film @entity10 in which the actress had a starring role , revealed he had to force her to put her robe back on after shooting her scene because she revelled in strutting around in her birthday suit			1
dame @entity8 , who stripped for the calendar , admitted in the past : ‘ i ’m famous for getting my kit off in @entity21			1
' @entity9 said : ‘ the actors were very supportive of each other : a bottle of champagne would be waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene			1
' they were all women in their 50s and 60s and were thrilled by roles that recognised their sensuality			1
' after one nude shoot , i recall having to tell @entity8 to put her robe back on three or four times			1
’ the 2003 film , based on the true story of @entity38 members who disrobe for a charity calendar , was a box office hit and earned @entity8 , now 69 , a @entity42 nomination			1
performing alongside @entity8 in the film was @entity47 , 62 , who has admitted , unlike the @entity45 - winning @entity44 star , she struggled with stripping off but @entity8 led the way			1
‘ i ca n’t bear taking my clothes off			0
i have never been a pretty young thing and stripping off is far more daring when you do n’t have a figure to die for			0
' but i love a challenge and there was never any question of us wearing flesh - coloured coverings			2
that would have been a cheat			0
' the real - life calendar girls taught all of us in the cast not to take ourselves too seriously - and @entity8 , who was used to disrobing for the camera , led us on			1
@entity47 said : ‘ i ca n’t bear taking my clothes off			1
' ‘ i was the first			0
i had first - night - style nerves beforehand but , given that my character was supposed to be nervous , the anxiety actually helped			2
' and the rest of the cast made a big fuss of me afterwards in my dressing room , where they ’d set out champagne and @entity75			1
’ littered with scenes of tasteful nudity , @entity9 confesses he struggled to know where to look during filming : ‘ however strategically we placed vegetables , bits kept showing through and we ’d have to reshoot			2
' even after we ’d cut the film , there were things popping out that should n’t have been - and a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing the private parts			0
although the nude scenes only took a week , it felt like a year			0
' the more you know you should n’t look , the more you want to , and i noticed the film crew keeping very busy , working far harder than they normally do because they did n’t want to be caught gazing			0
' it was a challenge as a director having to confront veteran actors who were completely naked			0
i ’ve never made so much eye contact in my life			0
i ’d offered to strip , so we were all in it together			0
' that might have made it easier for me , but the offer was declined			0
’ in @entity9 ’s opinion , the film broke the mould for middle - aged actresses – but it did not go down well with many male actors at the time			1
in his interview with the @entity114 , he said : ‘ it was rare for a film to focus on middle - aged women and not just show them as mothers or aunties			2
director @entity9 has confessed he struggled to know where to look during the filming for @entity10 ' but this made it harder to cast the male parts : several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women			2
' also , it was the era of @entity131 and @entity132 , and i was keen to make a film about northern @entity21 that was not about poverty and deprivation			0
' i remember waiting at @entity138 station to be collected by @entity8 ’s real - life counterpart			1
every time a battered old @entity141 came along , i thought that must be her			0
' then a black @entity143 roared up blaring rock music and there she was at the wheel			0
it brought home to me how guilty we all are of stereotyping			0
’ when interviewed several years ago about her penchant for nudity , @entity8 , who is married to director @entity155 , said : ‘ i ’m famous for getting my kit off in @entity21			2
it did used to get to me but i just kind of ignore it … i ’m still doing it !
