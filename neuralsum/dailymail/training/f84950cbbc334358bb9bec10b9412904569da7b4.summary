@entity0 is at the centre of a free speech storm after apparently blocking a page which supported one of @entity6 's sternest critics			1
some 13,000 people joined an event page calling for a rally in central @entity10 , where opposition leader @entity11 faces up to ten years ' jail over fraud charges he has branded ' utter lies '			1
but the page can no longer be viewed within @entity18 after a request by the internet watchdog @entity21 , the country 's state - backed news agency reported			2
facing jail : a @entity0 page supporting @entity18 opposition activist @entity11 ( pictured ) , who is accused of fraud by the @entity18 authorities , was blocked for @entity27 users sparking an outcry watchdog spokesman @entity29 said last night that the page had been blocked on the orders of @entity18 's general prosecutor			1
according to the @entity34 news agency , he said the prosecutor ' demanded to limit access to a number of resources calling for an unsanctioned mass event , including social networking groups			0
' the demand has been fulfilled			0
' the decision prompted outrage from mr @entity11 , the leader of @entity18 's opposition @entity45 , and former @entity47 ambassador to @entity10 @entity48			1
' it 's a rather unpleasant and surprising behaviour by @entity18 @entity0 , ' wrote mr @entity11 , whose reputation was built up through a prominent anti-corruption blog and online campaigns			1
controversial : the blocked page called for an ' assembly ' and ' discussion ' in @entity10 's @entity56 ' i thought they would at least demand a court order rather than rush to block pages as soon as crooks from the @entity21 ask			2
' mr @entity48 added that the block set a ' horrible precedent ' and that @entity0 should correct its ' mistake ' as soon as possible			2
supporters quickly signed up onto parallel event pages and made new ones blasting @entity0 's ' censorship '			0
the page called for a rally in @entity10 's @entity56 on january 15 , the day the opposition activist will hear the verdict in a major fraud case			1
named ' @entity75 : discussion of the @entity11 brothers ' sentence ' , its description added : ' @entity81			0
life 's too short to look at the table '			0
outcry : mr @entity11 , pictured outside a @entity10 court on friday , turned his ire on the social networking firm mr @entity11 , a 38 - year - old lawyer , is accused with his brother @entity88 of embezzling nearly 27million rubles ( Â£ 300,000 ) when the @entity18 arm of cosmetics firm @entity90 used their delivery firm			1
the case is only one of many against him			0
a previous probe into embezzlement of a state timber company saw him sentenced to five years , though the sentence was suspended later			0
in his final word this week mr @entity11 , who has spent almost a year under house arrest , said the case was based on ' utter lies			1
' he vowed to continue to defy president @entity6 's rule , blaming the government for the rouble collapse and other economic woes and saying that ' it 's robbing all of us every day			0
' despite these troubles president @entity6 's approval ratings have soared to more than 80 per cent , bolstered by the annexation of @entity114			0
@entity0 declined to comment , or confirm or deny it was responsible for the page being blocked .			2

he faces up to 10 years ' jail over fraud charges he branded ' utter lies '
