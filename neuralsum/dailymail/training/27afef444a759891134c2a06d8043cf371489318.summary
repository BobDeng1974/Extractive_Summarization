by @entity0 published : 14:40 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 16:05 est , 7 march 2013 just one in four thugs caught with a knife were jailed last year - despite public demands for robust sentences			1
official figures show knife thugs are less likely to be locked up on the spot than a year ago			1
nearly one in five is given a mere caution and hundreds get off with a community sentence			0
walking free : official figures have shown knife thugs are less likely to be locked up on the spot than a year ago only 25 per cent of criminals caught in possession of a knife were jailed on the spot in the last 12 months			1
that compares with nearly one in three in 2011			0
in the year to september 2012 a total of 3,376 adult offenders were sentenced for possession of a knife or other offensive weapon			1
of those 23 per cent - some 865 offenders - were handed community service by the courts - leaving them free to walk the streets			1
eighteen per cent were simply cautioned - a total of 683 criminals			2
some 15 per cent - 579 individuals - were given a suspended sentence , meaning they would be locked up only if they committed a further crime			2
plans : the @entity35 ' pledge , before the election , to jail anyone caught with a knife in public was ditched by then justice secretary @entity40 after he was advised it would put up to 8,000 more offenders behind bars one in 20 walked away with just a fine , while 149 criminals were given a ‘ discharged ’ offence - little more than a slap on the wrist			1
that left one in four , a total of 949 individuals , who were given an immediate custodial sentence			0
that knife thugs are less likely to be jailed on the spot will raise concerns about sentencing			1
review : justice minister @entity57 said the government has been conducting a review with the police on the use of cautions before the election , the @entity35 pledged to jail anyone caught with a knife in public			1
but the pledge was ditched by then justice secretary @entity40 after he was advised that it would put up to 8,000 more offenders behind bars at any one time			2
instead ministers introduced a new offence of aggravated knife carrying , which they said would lead to more mandatory knife sentences			2
the crime - which is committed by anyone using a knife to ‘ threaten or endanger others ' - became law in december			0
since 2007 the proportion of possession offences leading to immediate custodial sentences has risen , in particular during 2008 when sentencing guidelines were toughened up			0
the average jail term for possessing a knife was seven and a half months , the figures showed - around three months longer than it was at the end of 2007			1
overall the number of cautions or convictions for carrying a knife is down nearly a fifth since 2011			0
it could mean fewer criminals are carrying the weapons or simply that the police are less likely to catch them			0
justice minister @entity57 said : ' overall , knife crime has fallen but this is not enough			0
that is why we have just introduced a new offence of using a knife to threaten or endanger others which carries a mandatory custodial sentence			0
' in conjunction with police , the government is conducting a review of the use of cautions to make sure they are being used appropriately			0
