by @entity1 reporter published : 01:52 est , 2 december 2013 @entity3 : 02:07 est , 2 december 2013 @entity5 officials have identified a man who died more than 12 years ago while trying to get help for his drinking problem at an @entity10 meeting			1
no one knew the name of 53 - year - old @entity13 when he walked into the @entity5 meeting in 2001 and no friends or family came forward following his sudden death			1
he also had no identification on him when he collapsed beneath a sign that read , ‘ but for the grace of @entity21 ... ’ mystery solved : a man whose identity remained a mystery for 12 years after he slumped over dead in a 2001 @entity27 meeting has been identified as this man , 53 - year - old @entity13 tests later revealed he died from a withdrawal seizure due to chronic alcoholism			1
‘ it was like he ran out of breath , ’ @entity10 member @entity32 said at the time			1
for months , authorities tried to identify him			1
police showed his morgue photo to people in the neighborhood where he was last seen			1
the same photo appeared in newspapers and on television			2
people searching for missing loved ones became aware of the case , but left the morgue disappointed			2
‘ the case went cold , ’ said @entity50 , an investigator for the @entity51 , ‘ but we never forgot about the guy			2
’ better days : this photo provided by the @entity13 family shows @entity13 with his wife @entity56			1
it turns out @entity13 may have been trying to finally get sober in order to mend his relationship with @entity60 when he died of a seizure brought on by alcohol withdraw interest in the case resurfaced after the medical examiner 's office started loading data onto the @entity68 , or @entity68			1
it was launched in july 2007 as a national repository and resource center for missing persons and unidentified decedent records			2
none of the office 's dozen or so investigators are dedicated solely to identifying unknown bodies , and the office handles about 5,000 cases a year			2
as time allows , the office reviews dormant cases			2
‘ but a lot of these cases are not solved with technology , ’ @entity50 said			2
‘ sometimes they take some elbow grease			0
’ in october , @entity50 took @entity13 's fingerprints to @entity89			1
then she recognized that among several possible names listed , @entity13 's name appeared more than once			1
@entity50 also received information on @entity96 from a retired immigration file			0
‘ before that , the dots did not connect , ’ she said			0
according to the file , a person named @entity13 was born aug. 4 , 1947 , in @entity102 , @entity103			1
@entity104 died in 2005 without ever having known what happened to @entity13			1
@entity60 's sons were contacted by a researcher with the @entity51 and the puzzle was finally solved last week a subsequent inquiry to the @entity110 revealed a 1992 @entity112 address for @entity96			0
@entity5 medical examiner 's investigator @entity113 then located a @entity116 , @entity117 , small claims case from 1995 for @entity96 that included a woman at the address named @entity56			0
she had died in 2005 , but a request for her death certificate led to a @entity112 funeral home , where contact information was obtained on her two sons			0
@entity50 called one of the sons , @entity128 , who said his mother and @entity13 were married in 1976 , and that he had not seen his stepfather since late 2000 or 2001			1
last week , @entity128 viewed morgue and immigration photos and confirmed his stepfather 's identity , @entity50 said			0
‘ this whole thing is like a miracle , ’ said @entity50 , an investigator for the office			0
‘ it was like the timing was right			0
everyone i asked to help helped			0
’ @entity128 said his mother and stepfather separated over his drinking			0
‘ my mom told him if he did n't stop drinking , he needs to find somewhere else to live , ’ @entity128 said			0
‘ he left the house and never came back			0
’ when he died , he had no alcohol or drugs in his system			0
‘ i think he was trying to get help , ’ @entity128 said			0
‘ i think he was trying to get sober and show my mom he was a changed man			1
’ on saturday , @entity128 and his brother visited @entity96 's grave at @entity155 , where they finally were able to say goodbye			0
the brothers plan to install a headstone so their father will be identified permanently .			1

the man had no identification and no one at the @entity27 meeting knew him
no family or friends ever came forward to positively identify him
