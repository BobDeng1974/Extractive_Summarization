by @entity1 reporter published : 00:51 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 5 october 2013 president @entity3 has canceled a long - planned trip to @entity5 next week because of the government shutdown			1
the president had already shortened the trip from four countries to two but then on thursday the called the trip off all together			0
the @entity11 announced earlier in the week that @entity3 would be unable to visit @entity12 and the @entity13 because the partial shutdown of the federal government was impacting personnel needed to set up the stops			1
calling it off : president @entity3 and his advisers decided that they had to cancel his planned trip to @entity5 due to the ongoing government shutdown the @entity11 had held out hope that the president could attend to economic summits in @entity26 and @entity27			1
but he decided to skip the entire trip to stay in @entity29 to continue pressing for a budget bill that would reopen the government			0
he reportedly told the leaders of @entity12 and the @entity13 that he will be making visits to their countries later in his term but there has been no such public declaration for @entity26 - where he lived as a young boy - or @entity27			1
' the cancellation of this trip is another consequence of the @entity43 forcing a shutdown of the government , ' @entity11 press secretary @entity39 said in a statement			2
disappointment : dancers in @entity48 , @entity26 were performing at the welcome reception for the @entity51 conference on friday when it became clear that president @entity3 would not be attending			2
he was due to arrive sunday celebrating far away : secretary of state @entity53 will visit the four countries in the place of the president			0
he was already in @entity5 , seen here on thursday with secretary of defense @entity59 in @entity60 ( it was @entity62 's birthday ) ' this completely avoidable shutdown is setting back our ability to create jobs through promotion of @entity69 exports and advance @entity69 leadership and interests in the largest emerging region in the world			2
' @entity3 had been due to depart @entity29 late saturday night , and it is still unclear whether or not the shutdown will carry on until that point			0
even if @entity79 and the @entity80 are able to agree on a budget by that point , the president 's advance teams will not have enough time to prepare			1
a @entity85 article about the effects of the shutdown on the @entity11 revealed that all but one of the members of the @entity91 € ™ s advance team have been furloughed			1
after the first stops on the trip were canceled , deputy press secretary @entity94 was tasked with cancelling the private planes that had been booked for the flight , and now he will surely be making some more calls			0
continued confusion : senate majority leader @entity99 defended the @entity101 stance against @entity103 attempts to gut the @entity104 as part of the budget approval process secretary of state @entity53 , already on a trip to @entity5 , is visiting all four countries in place of the president			0
the @entity11 said @entity3 called the @entity111 of @entity27 and @entity26 president @entity112 on thursday night to express his regret			1
prior to their announcement , some thought that there would be some benefits for the president to be seen as global leader			0
' timing is everything , and if the moment is right to contrast leading on the world scene to being stuck in @entity29 gridlock , going on the road makes some sense , ' said @entity127 , who served as former president @entity129 's press secretary during the last federal shutdown .			0

president was originally *scheduled* to visit @entity12 , the @entity13 , @entity26 and @entity27
@entity12 and the @entity13 were canceled earlier this week but then on thursday night the @entity11 announced all four were off
furloughs from the government shutdown meant that the president 's advance team was reduced to just one person
