history buff : @entity1 cooked ration recipes for years before plunging into @entity4 life @entity1 recalls the day her mother - in - law revealed the highlight of her wartime childhood			1
‘ the weekly treat for her and her sister was sharing one fried egg , ’ she says			2
‘ i thought : “ wow , how did you cope ? ” ’ @entity1 ’s interest was more than merely academic			1
a history buff , she had been cooking ration recipes for fun for many years , and knew that the frugal wartime regime had actually left the population healthier — despite the food shortages — than it had ever been before			1
‘ there was a huge team of people at the @entity23 during the war working on healthy recipes that contained loads of vegetables , ’ she says			2
‘ that ’s what really captured my imagination that you could live on a lot less and feel good on it			2
it struck me that living on @entity36 rations might be an interesting way to lose weight and save money			2
’ the social media administrator from @entity41 had fought a losing battle with her weight for many years			1
at her heaviest , she tipped the scales at almost 25st			1
‘ everyone has a crutch they can rely on and mine has been food , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’m an emotional eater			2
’ a series of family traumas , including separation from her husband , had led her eating habits to spiral out of control until she worried for her own wellbeing			2
‘ i had a racing pulse , i was sweating , my back was hurting , ’ she says			2
and as a single mother to three children , @entity62 , now 25 , @entity63 , 21 , and @entity64 , 16 , she felt a responsibility to look after her health			2
and so she embarked on a year - long ration diet			1
in 12 months , @entity1 lost 5st 10 lb , getting her weight down to 15st 9 lb. numerous diets had failed her			1
‘ @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , i tried them all , ’ she says			1
‘ i had some success , but none captured my imagination			1
and i did n’t like relying on processed food full of preservatives			0
’ so in place of the diet meal replacement bars and milkshakes she had previously relied on , she began to feed herself and her family on mock apricot tart made with carrots and @entity86			1
' i was sweating , my back was hurting			0
' and as a single mother to three children , @entity62 , now 25 , @entity63 , 21 , and @entity64 , 16 , she felt a responsibility to look after her health , @entity1 said the latter , named after the minister of food who popularised the recipe , involved dicing and cooking potatoes or parsnips , cauliflower , swede , carrots and turnip			1
rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water , which was poured over the vegetables			1
the dish was then topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy			0
haute cuisine it certainly was n’t , as @entity1 discovered			1
‘ the first two or three weeks or rationing was like going cold turkey , ’ she says			0
‘ to begin with , i felt it was really bland , but after a week or two i began to appreciate it because my palate had changed			0
’ the portion sizes were another shock			0
after all , the weekly ration of four slices of bacon and 2oz of butter would n’t see many of us through a single breakfast			0
‘ i used to eat pounds of cheese a week , but the ration was as much as you ’d have on one generous slice of cheese on toast			0
it made me realise how much i ’d been consuming , ’ says @entity1			1
as well as the bacon or ham and butter , a weekly adult ration allowed for the equivalent of two small meat chops , 2oz of cheese , 4oz of margarine , 4oz of cooking fat and three pints of milk			0
war on fat : @entity1 as she is today with some of the recipes which helped her slim			1
right , a @entity4 leaflet enthusiast : the mother - of - three was interested in wartime rationing and had reproductions of pamphlets cooking in wartime : a weekly adult supply included two small meat chops , 2oz of cheese and 4oz of margarine it also included 8oz of sugar , 2oz of tea and one whole egg or one packet of dried eggs every four weeks , along with 12oz of sweets			1
every two months , a pound of preserves was added			0
families would also have bread , oats , fruit and vegetables , and a monthly points allowance could be used to buy foods that were in short supply			1
the maximum 16 points would buy one can of fish , 2 lb of dried fruit or 8 lb of split peas			0
@entity1 estimates her calorie intake decreased from around 5,000 a day to a far healthier 2,000			1
not only this , her meals were packed with vitamins and goodness			0
she was eating so many vegetables that she rarely felt hungry			0
her lifestyle became healthier in other ways , too			0
realising that the wartime housewife would have taken far more exercise than she did , she tried to mimic the effects of petrol rationing by walking up to three miles a day			0
meanwhile , the demands of whipping up something tasty from the available rations meant she had to give up tv in the evenings to spend her time on her feet cooking			0
‘ it was labour - intensive , cooking everything from scratch in a wartime way , ’ she says			0
‘ i tried to be authentic , so i used wooden spoons rather than a blender			0
’ novel : the lord woolton pie contains potatoes , carrots , cauliflower , swede , @entity214 and rolled oats tasty : unlike traditional diets the recipes were not all salads - these spam fritters , for example keep calm and carrot on : these cookies may look unhealthy , but they were made out of carrots well - travelled : ' @entity226 ' biscuits were made to send to the @entity227 and @entity228 back in the comfort zone : some of the more reassuring recipes included these spam sandwiches her recipes were sourced from the internet , and she also found old pamphlets and @entity237 ’s cookery books for inspiration			1
her children grew accustomed to the strange smells emanating from their mother ’s kitchen			0
‘ they loved the @entity226 biscuits , made from oats and desiccated coconut , and the carrot cookies — but anything that involved @entity248 or curry did n’t go down well , ’ she says			1
‘ what i mostly did was to slip vegetables into cakes without telling them , because if i ’d said i was doing apricot flan made from carrots they would n’t touch it with a barge pole			1
’ the fake banana sandwiches , made from over-cooked parsnips mashed up with banana essence and golden syrup , were n’t popular either — ‘ though @entity64 swallowed a few mouthfuls before she realised and her face contorted into a priceless expression of horror ! ’ @entity1 ’s personal sticking point was powdered egg — ‘ it does the job , but i ’d advise you not to stick your nose in the packet ’ — and a carrot curry she attempted			1
‘ that was revolting , ’ she says			0
‘ it just tasted like carrots and curry powder			1
’ for @entity280 dinner , she served up cake with mock marzipan ( flour , margarine , sugar and almond essence ) , eggless @entity280 pudding and @entity288 made from sausage meat ( vegan in her case , as she is vegetarian )			2
@entity292 : a shop assistant explaining the ration - book to a customer in 1939 stringent : residents had to register for ration books and stick to a strict diet with few calories to perforate or not to perforate : there was a heated debate at the time over wasting time with scissors doing the maths : @entity305 went shopping with 29 ration books for her six married daughters her children participated by hand - making the decorations			2
by october 2012 , at the end of her experiment in living history , @entity1 was amazed by her huge weight - loss			1
and what ’s more , she found she had saved almost £ 3,000 in the same time by giving up takeaway coffee , processed food and sandwiches in favour of home - cooked rations			0
‘ i could feed myself on £ 1 to £ 2 a day			0
it made a significant difference , ’ she says			2
‘ before my ration diet , i was spending between £ 5 and £ 10 a day on food and coffee			2
’ but since returning to her normal diet 18 months ago , @entity1 has seen the weight piling on again			1
now she is back to over 20st , so once more , she ’s dusting off the old pamphlets and recreating wartime delicacies in the hopes of shedding 7st			0
so far , she ’s whipped up eggless pancakes for @entity331 and dished up her favourite recipe , @entity86 , more than once			0
‘ i make it most weeks and it ’s fantastic , ’ she says			0
and after just three weeks back on the @entity4 diet , she ’s already lost 12 lb. there ’s no doubt that rationing helped us win the war			1
but perhaps 70 years on , we should once again be eating for victory — this time to win the battle of the bulge			0

@entity1 had tried @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73
but @entity4 diet was first success for 25st history buff from @entity41
she ate ' apricot ' tart made with carrots and lord @entity351 *'s* rolled oats pie
