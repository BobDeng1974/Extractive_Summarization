it ’s that time of year when the @entity2 challenge in @entity3 fades in the face of overwhelming firepower and the thorny issue of the salary cap re-surfaces			1
this time , @entity8 has sounded the annual alarm			0
@entity11 ’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed @entity14 all the way before losing their @entity17 quarter - final at @entity18 on sunday			1
yet , the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of @entity23 and @entity24 – two of the world ’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts			0
a pair of @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , were among a glittering non-playing contingent			0
@entity11 coach @entity8 has called for reform to the @entity37 salary cap so @entity2 clubs can compete on the @entity3 stage - the comments came after his team lost 32 - 18 to @entity14 on sunday @entity42 makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the @entity14 player on the ground @entity14 's @entity2 speedster @entity47 makes a break for the defending champions @entity51 v saracens , @entity52 , @entity53 , saturday , april 18 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) @entity14 v @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , sunday , april 19 , 3.15pm ( gmt ) @entity8 quipped that the absence of @entity58 from the @entity14 ranks meant that @entity11 only had ‘ about five world - class full - backs to worry about ’			1
the joke hinted at a more serious point ; the personnel gulf between the wealthy @entity65 elite and their @entity37 rivals			2
the @entity2 clubs simply ca n’t compete when the leading @entity68 sides play to their potential , due to the disparity in budgets			2
yet again , the salary cap — currently £ 5.5million — is back on the agenda			2
‘ there are pros and cons for everything , ’ said @entity8			0
‘ the salary cap has worked ; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period , it ’s the most competitive league in @entity3 and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons , too			1
@entity11 ' no 10 @entity42 kicks away from @entity85 during their @entity17 quarter - final @entity14 playmaker @entity85 pulls the strings for the defending @entity3 champions ‘ it has also meant a lot of young @entity2 players are getting exposure at that level , so it has done what it was intended to do			1
but maybe we need a a re-think about how important @entity3 is to the @entity2 teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big @entity65 teams			1
‘ realistically , @entity37 teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit			0
with the salary cap , there ’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have			1
’ @entity11 could n’t match @entity14 ’s depth of playing resources , but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young englishmen — centre @entity116 and scrum - half @entity118			1
their electric running maintained the form @entity8 believes should put them in contention for a place in @entity127 ’s @entity126 squad			0
‘ i do n’t know what more they can do , ’ said the @entity128			0
‘ if @entity127 want to win the @entity126 , these are the type of players you have to get in your team			0
’ @entity136 rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin - binned @entity138 crosses for a late try for @entity14 as they put victory over @entity11 on sunday beyond doubt			2

@entity8 wants to reform the current salary cap in @entity2 top *flight*
it means @entity37 clubs are *struggling* to compete with @entity65
@entity8 's @entity11 side lost 32 - 18 to @entity14 in @entity17 last eight
only @entity151 made it through to the last four from @entity127
