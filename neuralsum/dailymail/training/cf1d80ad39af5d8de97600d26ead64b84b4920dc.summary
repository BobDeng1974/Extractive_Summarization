as he drops new hints about his 2016 intentions , former @entity4 gov. @entity3 is appearing in @entity5 just weeks before a self - imposed deadline to decide whether he will run for president			1
@entity3 is scheduled to give monday 's commencement address at the @entity9			1
it marks the @entity13 leader 's second visit in three months to the state that will host the 2016 presidential primary season 's first contest in the @entity5			2
in a television interview aired on the eve of the @entity5 appearance , @entity3 expressed confidence that he ' would be a good president , ' adding that he was in the process of writing an e-book about his time as governor that would come out in the spring			1
' one of the things i am going to do as i go through this process is release all my emails [ from my time in office ] and write an e-book , ' he told @entity32 , which he said was an effort to promote transparency and to ' let people make up their mind			1
and that 's what we need right now in @entity58			2
' ' sometime early next year i 'll release the 250,000 emails , ' @entity3 said in the televised interview			1
' i was digital before digital was cool , i guess			2
now it 's like commonplace			0
' he also told @entity32 of the emails ' there 's some funny ones			2
there 's some sad ones			0
there 's some serious ones			0
' asked about a potential presidential run , @entity3 said ' this is a really serious , life - changing decision , and i 'm going to take my time , but i realize that at some point end of this year , early next year , i 'll make a decision to really pursue this or to stand down			1
' aides report that @entity3 does not plan to meet with political operatives while in @entity5			1
and monday 's speech is not expected to touch on any overtly political themes			0
but his mere presence in a state high on the presidential primary calendar will stoke new speculation that he is moving toward a @entity88 bid			0
as the son of one president and brother of another , @entity3 has the power to transform the 2016 contest like no other @entity13			1
he can tap into his family 's vast political network , and his campaign would attract strong support from major donors and widespread media attention			0
public release : @entity3 said he also will publish 250,000 from when he served as the governor of @entity4 family : as the son of former president @entity105 , center , and the brother of former president @entity108 , left , @entity3 has the power to transform the 2016 contest like no other @entity13 ( 1999 photo ) but his supporters are struggling to understand what @entity3 's actions mean and whether they can predict his political intentions			1
he spent much of the recent midterm campaign out of the public eye			2
the @entity5 address , however , will be his fourth high - profile speech in recent weeks			0
that includes an appearance before corporate executives in @entity123 , where he called for his party to embrace an immigration overhaul and to focus on governing			0
he also said he would make the call on running for president ' not that far out in the future			2
' at the same time @entity3 has been expanding his private equity business , and advisers insist he 's not courting a political staff in @entity133 and @entity134 , even as other would - be candidates assemble their 2016 campaign teams in the early voting states			1
about all anyone can say for certain is that , as @entity3 himself has said , he 's still thinking about it and plans to make a decision by the end of the month			1
' he 's begun the journey			0
how long it will take him , i do n't know , ' said @entity146 , a longtime @entity3 friend and former chairman of the @entity148			1
' people are interpreting activity to conclude that he 's closer to running			0
i 'm not of that school			0
' i hope he runs , but i believe the activity is based on getting serious			0
