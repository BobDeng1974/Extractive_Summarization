by @entity0 they might look like a cluster of microbes , or even pictures of distant galaxies			0
but these black and white moving images reveal the inside of fruit and vegetables in a whole new way			2
they were produced by a @entity13 student using a magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity16 ) scanner , which is typically used by medical professionals for peering into the brain			1
tutti fruiti : a @entity13 student has used a magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity16 ) scanner to record cross sections of the inside of fruit , such as the pomegranate ( pictured ) the specialist machines monitor brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow , but in this case were used to let people see inside popular fruits and vegetables in cross sections without using a knife to cut into them			1
they include an image of broccoli that looks like a cosmic explosion or shower of confetti and mesmerising views of passion fruit and corn that show all the small seeds or kernels inside them			0
@entity46 , an @entity16 technologist at @entity47 has been making fruit and vegetables exciting since 2010 using his high tech kit			1
explosion ! they include an image of broccoli ( pictured ) that looks like a cosmic explosion or shower of confetti psychedelic : the edible banana flower ( pictured ) makes some crazy patterns when placed in an @entity16 scanner since beginning his blog he has racked up around 65 sets of images of fruit , flowers and vegetables , from everyday staples like apples and tomatoes to unusual and exotic fruits such as a horned melon called kiwano and jackfruit – a large fruit with a textured skin that weighs around 22lbs ( 10kg )			1
the fruit used by mr @entity46 measured 18inches ( 46cm ) in length and mr @entity46 wrote on his blog , @entity81 , ‘ i barely could fit it in any of my coils ’			0
instead of scanning the entire fruit as usual , he had to slice sections off at either end to fit it in his @entity16 scanner			2
exotic : the kiwano ( pictured ) belongs to the melon and cucumber family and is native to @entity93			0
it looks a little bit like a microbe under the @entity16 scanner confusing : cereal grains such as corn ( pictured ) and rice are confusingly a type of fruit called a caryopsis but the fruit wall is incredibly thin and fused to the seed coat so almost the entirety of the edible grain is a seed a fruit is usually any sweet - tasting plant product associated with seeds , whereas a vegetable is any savoury plant product			2
vegetables that are actually fruit include cucurbits such as squashes and cucumbers as well as tomatoes , peas , beans , corn , aubergine and sweet pepper			0
really fruity : vegetables that are actually fruit include cucurbits such as squashes and cucumbers ( pictured ) as well as tomatoes , peas , beans , corn , aubergine and sweet pepper a taste of the tropics : as well as imaging everyday fruit and vegetables , @entity46 used his @entity16 scanner to capture cross sections of more exotic fruit and eats , such as the banana flower ( pictured left ) and the kiwano ( pictured right ) an @entity93 fruit in the cucumber and melon family blooming marvellous : this bunch of celery looks a little like a rose under the @entity16 scanner chillies are also fruits , while rhubarb , which is commonly referred to as a fruit , is botanically a vegetable			1
cereal grains such as wheat and rice are confusingly a type of fruit called a caryopsis but the fruit wall is incredibly thin and fused to the seed coat so almost the entirety of the edible grain is a seed			0
passionate : since beginning his blog , mr @entity46 has racked up around 65 images of fruit , flowers and vegetables , including this passion fruit @entity167 good : the use of the scanner lets people see strawberries ( pictured ) in a whole new way			1

the images were created using a magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity16 ) scanner , which is typically used to monitor brain activity
the scans reveal cross sections of different fruits and vegetables from tomatoes and cucumbers to more exotic kiwanos and banana flowers
@entity46 , an @entity16 technologist at @entity47 has captured 65 fruits , vegetables and flowers so far
