the biggest road - building programme for almost half a century is unveiled by ministers today			0
ministers will announce a £ 15billion masterplan to build or upgrade 1,300 miles of roads			1
the move is an echo of the ‘ roads for prosperity ’ scheme unveiled by @entity9 in 1989 to boost ‘ the great car economy			2
new charging points every 20 miles on most routes will promote the use of greener electric vehicles			1
‘ this is the biggest investment in our road network since the 1970s , ’ said mr @entity19 , who chairs the @entity28 ’s infrastructure committee			1
‘ my view is previous governments over the last four decades have systematically underinvested in our roads , railways , telecoms and energy			2
‘ that ’s something that has really weakened our economic growth and has held @entity41 back			2
‘ we have to make very difficult choices in other areas of public spending in order to unlock this big investment			2
we ’ve made the @entity48 a department for infrastructure			0
’ the plans include making the @entity52 a dual carriageway almost all the way to the @entity55 border he insisted reforms to the @entity58 will make it impossible for a future government to trim the programme to save cash			1
‘ the @entity58 is becoming more autonomous , like @entity64			0
it will be given a brief every five years and will go away and deliver it			0
so future governments simply ca n’t decide to turn this all upside down again , ’ the chief secretary said			0
the @entity69 said : ‘ over 1,300 new lane miles will be added by schemes being delivered over the next parliament on motorways and trunk roads , tackling congestion and fixing some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the network			1
‘ with 90 per cent of journeys taking place on our roads , this work is vital to help people get on and get around			2
’ spending during the next parliament on @entity86 ’s roads network will be boosted further by maintenance funding worth more than £ 10billion across the road network			1
one of the flagship projects is a £ 2billion commitment to have dual carriageways for the entire @entity92 and @entity93 to the @entity94 , including a twin - bore 1.8mile tunnel at the notorious @entity97 bottleneck			1
this will allow road users to drive on a dual carriageway from @entity101 to within 15 miles of @entity102			1
there will be improvements to a third of the junctions on the @entity107 ‘ to aid frustrated commuters stuck in traffic around the capital ’			1
in the @entity112 , the government is setting aside £ 290million to complete the dualling of the @entity52 from @entity101 to @entity114 , just 25 miles from the @entity55 border ‘ to make the @entity116 truly great again ’			1
across the @entity117 and @entity118 the government aims to complete a ‘ smart ’ motorway along the entire length of the @entity121 from @entity122 to @entity123 along with improvements to transpennine capacity from @entity122 to @entity126			2
there will be a commitment to improve links to the @entity130 as one of 12 projects designed to improve access to trading gateways			0
in the @entity136 there will be funding for £ 350million of improvements to the @entity138 along the south coast to tackle severe congestion at @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
some £ 300million has been earmarked to upgrade the east - west connection to @entity145 with new dual carriageway sections of the @entity147 and improved links to the @entity52 and @entity149			1
@entity151 president @entity150 said : ‘ all road users are entitled to safe and uncongested national arteries			0
we can no longer ignore the inadequate resources going into the mainstay of the @entity41 transport system – our roads – which carry 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight			0
‘ we spend less than a quarter of motoring taxes on this critical national asset whilst many key competitor countries spend much more			0
‘ at long last the government has recognised that we need a long term coherent plan for our roads , with guaranteed funding , to end the stop - start mess experienced over the last few decades			0
’ the @entity169 will see improvements to the @entity171 to the east of @entity173 to improve connections , including to @entity173 airport .			0

@entity177 will see 1,300 miles of roads built or upgraded
the @entity52 , @entity92 , @entity107 and @entity180 are among 100 separate schemes
