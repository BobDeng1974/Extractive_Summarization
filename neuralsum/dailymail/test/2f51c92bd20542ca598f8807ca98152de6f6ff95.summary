at five - under - par on his second shot on the ninth , @entity0 found himself 470 yards from the hole with the ball nestled snugly into the pine straw that surrounds the beautifully groomed fairway			2
however following through on his swing the four - time @entity11 champion drilled his club into a tree root , causing the 39 - year - old to drop his club and give out a painful yell			1
