by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 15:44 est , 29 november 2013 dark side : @entity4 blamed the ' dark side of globalisation ' for the problem of immigration @entity9 has weighed in to the immigration debate by suggesting that @entity12 politicians are now unable to cope with the country ’s ‘ porous borders ’			1
the chairman of the @entity16 and former conservative minister blamed the ‘ dark side of globalisation ’ for the problem			1
@entity4 also suggested that elected representatives were increasingly reluctant to tell people the truth about such vexed issues			1
his words – delivered to an international audience at the @entity26 in @entity27 – comes at a time when @entity12 is preparing to deal with an influx of immigrants from @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity9 said : ‘ today with porous borders , the amount that politicians and political leaders can actually do on their own is very limited , and i think that it ’s a pity that people do n’t make that point rather more vigorously			2
’ he said that ‘ immigration , organised crime , drugs ’ and ‘ epidemic disease ’ were just some of the ‘ aspects of the dark sides of globalisation ’ leaving national governments increasingly powerless			1
referring to the september 11th 2001 attacks on @entity47 in which almost 3000 people died , @entity9 said : ‘ the 9/11 terrorists were paid for with credit cards – that ’s the world we live in and i think it ’s astonishing that politicians are so reluctant to say we ’re not any more facing a series of challenges which are manageable within our own space , we ’re trying to cope with a predicament			1
‘ it ’s proved extremely difficult for political leaders to tell people what they may not want to hear and get elected			2
worries : his words come at a time when @entity12 is preparing to deal with an influx of immigrants from @entity31 and @entity32			0
pictured are eastern @entity69 workers queuing up outside the @entity12 embassy in @entity71 , @entity32 , for visa applications ‘ and the general consequence has been that political leaders only tell people a bit of what they do n’t want to hear , which does n’t entirely prevent the growth of populism and parties on the extreme but can just about secure their election or near election			2
’ @entity9 , who is also a former @entity69 commissioner , said the problem with @entity85 as it faced up to such problems was its lack of accountability			1
while ‘ the buck stopped ’ with leaders like @entity94 in @entity12 and @entity95 in @entity96 , there was no - one in @entity85 who was ultimately to blame for anything			1
@entity9 said : ‘ i would give national parliaments a greater role in the legislative process and policy making in @entity85			2
weak @entity85 : @entity9 , who is also a former @entity69 commissioner , said the problem with @entity85 as it faced up to such problems was its lack of accountability ‘ i would give them a red card as well as a yellow card when it came to proportionality and subsidiarity , and secondly i would create a parliamentary body , a sort of senate in @entity85 – a body which represented national parliaments and had some kind of overriding view			1
’ @entity9 warned against transferring any more power to the @entity69 parliament because ‘ currently there is n’t any @entity69 demos ’			0
on the growth of power of @entity69 institutions , @entity9 said : ‘ i think that at the moment we ’re in a crazy world			0
i bet you would hardly find a single @entity69 political leader who thought that the right way to get greater accountability into the system would be by giving more power to the @entity69 parliament			0
’ no demos : @entity9 warned against transferring any more power to the @entity69 parliament ( pictured ) because ' currently there is n't any @entity69 demos ' in words which may anger mr @entity94 , @entity9 also praised @entity136 chancellor @entity135			0
he said : ‘ quite interesting how chancellor @entity135 who is probably the most successful politician in @entity69 at the moment , has been very nervous of ever embracing any agenda for radical change			0
‘ if you look at the agenda , which she has agreed with her allies in the coalition you can see that confirmed			0
’ there were also stern words about @entity148 , whom @entity9 suggested was living up to its international role as a ‘ trouble maker ’			2
referring to @entity148 president @entity153 and to the disgraced former @entity155 prime minister @entity154 , @entity9 said : ‘ in @entity69 we have been pretty weedy , as schoolboys would say , in the way we have dealt with @entity148 in the @entity159			0
@entity160 : referring to @entity148 president @entity153 and to the disgraced former @entity155 prime minister @entity154 , @entity9 said , ' in @entity69 we have been pretty weedy , as schoolboys would say , in the way we have dealt with @entity148 in the @entity159 ' ‘ and i think we ’re being pretty weedy at the moment in the way we are debating the future of the eastern partnership and those countries which escaped the @entity148 empire of the 1970s and 80s and which mr @entity153 would like to have back in the hutch			0
‘ @entity148 is of course a country with a great history , with great literature and artistic tradition but i do n’t see much of that in mr @entity153 frankly , and i ’m not surprised that his best @entity69 friend is mr @entity154			0
