by @entity0 dressed in a black bra and thong , @entity3 , 18 , from @entity4 , gyrates her way through a crowd of men , many drunk and leering			1
but this is one stripper who does n't live up to the stereotype			2
@entity3 spends her evenings taking her clothes off to pay for a degree in sports science - her passport , she hopes , to a better life			1
' stripping is just an escape from everything , ' she explains			1
' i go in there and i 'm a completely different person			2
' i 'm totally the opposite			2
because the place i live in is n't a very good area , i want to be better and do my family proud			1
to do that , i am a stripper			2
' with universities charging £ 9,000 a year or more in tuition fees , she 's far from being the only student to turn to sex work to survive			2
a recent study published by the @entity45 found that as many as one in three strippers are students and blamed the figure on the increasing costs of tuition fees			1
and it 's not just strip clubs that have benefited from students who turn to sex work to pay their fees			1
others fund their studies by turning to sugar daddy websites such as @entity59 , where girls are paid up to £ 15,000 a year in exchange for ' companionship '			1
determined : @entity3 says she will do whatever it takes to overcome her deprived upbringing ' a lot of people that i grew up with do n't really care and just skive			1
i 'm totally the opposite			2
because the place i live in is n't a very good area , i want to be better and do my family proud			1
to do that , i am a stripper			2
' experts have also claimed that one of the reasons for the increase in student sex workers is that the work is becoming more socially acceptable			0
speaking to the @entity82 magazine , sociologist @entity80 said that some student strippers saw themselves as ' dancers , not sex workers ' because ' selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable			1
' for @entity3 , who still lives at home with her father , stripping is the first job she 's ever had and she admits she was thrilled when she was told she 'd got it			1
' i applied for a lot of jobs before and i kept getting knocked back because i had no experience , ' she explains			0
' i have no idea how i had the confidence to walk in here ... it 's crazy			0
it just sort of happened really quickly			0
' i was so excited afterwards			0
i was thinking " i 'm 18 and i 've got a job ! " i went and had icecream afterwards to celebrate			1
' she now spends six nights a week working at @entity104 , one of three strip clubs that make up @entity4 's ' @entity107 '			1
it 's not always easy , although @entity3 , who makes around £ 100 a night , says the work has given her extra confidence			1
' when i was at school , the boys found some girls attractive but not once did they look at me , ' she remembers			2
different world : @entity115 is just 18 - years - old and says stripping is the first and only job she 's ever had relationship : @entity3 wo n't allow her boyfriend @entity120 to see her at work for fear of hurting him ' they [ the other girls ] were all really skinny with nice clothes , and nice hair , and i was a bit chubby			1
i got into dancing to prove that i can be beautiful , i can be sexy			0
she adds : ' a year ago , i could n't get on buses without being really anxious			0
i feel better about myself , even though dancing maybe is n't the prettiest job in the world and i know some people would say it 's sleazy			0
' i walk out with my head held high and it 's empowering			0
' @entity120 does n't share her enthusiasm however and says he worries about @entity3 's safety when she 's at work			1
' i think [ strip clubs ] can be seedy places and i 'm worried for her wellbeing , ' he reveals			0
' i think i might get a bit jealous if i was to see her doing sexy provocative stuff ... i think " that 's just for me ! " but at the end of the day , i know it 's just her job			0
' new life : @entity3 hopes to one day swap stripping for a job as a police woman after college @entity3 herself has imposed a set of strict rules on @entity120 and refuses to let him go to the club where she works			1
' i do n't want him to see me doing this , ' she admits			0
' i think it would hurt him too much			0
he just means too much to me for me to do that to him			0
' ultimately , for @entity115 , stripping , however distasteful , is a means to an end and a route out of the grim estate where she grew up and still lives			1
' i really hate where i live , ' she admits			0
' it 's a horrible , horrible place			0
i would n't bring my children up here and i kind of hate that i was brought up here			0
' her goal , she says , is to use her sports science degree to become a policewoman			2
' i like that you get to be a strong independent woman , ' she smiles			0
' i like the idea of helping the public and dealing with tough situations			0
' she 's certainly no stranger to the latter			0
