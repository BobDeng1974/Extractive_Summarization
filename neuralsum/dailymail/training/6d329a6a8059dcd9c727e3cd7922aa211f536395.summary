so it 's no surprise that @entity9 's latest batch of cute meerkat babies looked a little unsure about venturing out of their burrow and into the big wide world today			1
the youngsters were spotted creeping up to the very edge of the burrow before curiously examining all of the goings on			1
tentative : a very cautious meerkat pokes its head out of the burrow to see it the coast is clear of predators around the enclosure at @entity24 today alert : the naturally wary creature looks both ways as it reconnoiters the area before setting foot outside the safety of its burrow blinking into the light : the baby meerkats get their first taste for fresh air as they peer out from the safety of the burrow at @entity24 for the first time however , not one of them was brave enough to step a paw out into the enclosure , even when given a little encouragement from some adults			1
but soon the sheer wait of numbers trying to get a look at the big world outside from the burrow entrance was enough to open the floodgates and send the youngsters scurrying into the sunshine			2
the tentative critters - which rarely grow larger than 14 inches tall and weight little more than 1.5lbs - were snapped by photographer @entity56 during one of his wildlife photography workshops			0
baby merekats or kits are born underground - in large social groups up to 30 strong - in extensive burrow systems and remain there for the first two or three weeks of their lives			1
safety in numbers : the little meerkat is emboldened when its sibling arrives to provide back up for the impending adventure at @entity24 now or never : sensing this is the time to make the leap into the unknown and explore their surroundings , the pair tentatively set foot outside the burrow but there always comes a time when they have to set foot outside the safety of their labyrinth			1
and what the tiny creatures lose in size to possible predators , they more than make up for with force of numbers			2
the highly social animals often display very altruistic behaviour - with several of the gang acting as sentries to keen an eye out for any approaching predators			0
the animals rear up onto their hind legs and into their distinctive pose for the best view			0
floodgates open : with their new found confidence , the entire gang pour our of the burrow for their own taste of fresh air having spent the first two or three weeks of their lives underground when a predator is spotted , the meerkat performing as sentry gives a warning bark , and other members of the gang will run and hide in one of the many bolt holes they have spread across their territory			1
the sentry meerkat is the first to reappear from the burrow and search for predators , constantly barking to keep the others underground			2
if there is no threat , the sentry meerkat stops signaling and the others feel safe to emerge			0
meerkats also babysit the young in the group			0
meerkats have been known to engage in social activities , including what appear to be wrestling matches and foot races			0
on guard : the ever cautious adult meerkats keep an eye on their adventurous young as they frolic in the sunshine in case of any predators			0
