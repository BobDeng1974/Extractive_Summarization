slick : despite being over 800 years old , the property - which was renovated 30 years ago - has all the mod cons in its fabulously stylish kitchen eating well ! the wooden - finished dining room , which would easily seat a dozen guests , is just off the entrance hall 1 - @entity32 ( annulled ; died while detained under guard at @entity118 ) 2 - @entity119 ( annulled and later executed ) 3 - @entity120 ( died days after giving birth , widely believed to be following birth complications ) 4 - @entity84 ( annulled ) 5 - @entity123 ( annulled and later executed ) 6 - @entity124 ( widowed ) in 1332 , the @entity8 was held by @entity125 who , rather quaintly , was granted the right to hold two fairs at @entity8			1
