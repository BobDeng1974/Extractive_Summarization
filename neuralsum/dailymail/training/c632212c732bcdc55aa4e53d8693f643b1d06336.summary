fifteen - month - old @entity15 died during a three - hour , unsupervised visit with his father , @entity19 of @entity20 , police said			1
@entity22 spokesman @entity21 said that led police to further probe the 2008 suicide of @entity26 ' mother and the 2003 shooting death of his ex-girlfriend @entity28			1
prince @entity29 died during unsupervised time with his father @entity31 on october 21			1
police are now looking into the suicide of @entity35 ' mother and shooting of his ex-girlfriend			1
the boy 's mother , @entity39 , said the system failed to protect the boy after she fought vehemently to prevent the unsupervised visits , which were ordered by a judge in @entity45			1
authorities have not yet determined how the boy died , and @entity35 has not been charged with a crime			2
but @entity39 said the unusual confluence of deaths is not easily explained			0
' either he 's the most unlucky bastard on this planet , or he 's a killer , ' said @entity39 , who fled the relationship with her one - time fiance about two weeks after @entity29 was born			1
@entity26 did not answer calls to his cellphone			0

@entity39 , the mother of @entity15 , said @entity31 was ' either the most unlucky b * * * * * d on this planet , or he 's a killer			1
' @entity39 said she has been given only a little information about her son 's injuries			2
but she said the hospital called child protective services because of suspicious injuries , including dried blood in his nose and a bruise on his forehead			0
during a custody hearing for @entity35 in march , investigators testified @entity76 is a suspect in the killing of @entity28 , 22 , who was shot in the head in her @entity20 condo in 2003			2
in 2008 , @entity35 ' mother , @entity82 , was found dead			1
@entity83 at the time ruled the death a suicide			2
while @entity20 police say all the investigations remain a high priority , @entity89 police spokesman @entity87 said investigators have so far not found anything to indicate @entity96 ' death was not a suicide			1
but her son @entity101 ' half brother - said it makes no sense that his mother would have killed herself and said he has been interviewed by police investigating whether his mother 's death was a homicide			1
' my mother in her life never had a history of depression , ' @entity110 said			2
he described his half brother as ' a monster , ' describing how even at age 3 , his younger brother attacked him on the head with a hammer he had hidden behind his back as he feigned a request for a kiss			0

but the judge granted @entity35 visitation - first supervised , and then unsupervised			1
@entity39 , an intelligence analyst who once was a contestant on the @entity132 reality competition ' @entity133 , ' said she does not understand why the judge ignored her concerns for her son 's safety			0
this was accompanied by evidence of @entity76 ' lack of fitness as a father : his involvement in running an online pornography business ; the testimony from the @entity20 detective that @entity35 is a suspect in his ex-girlfriend 's killing ; and a sexual encounter between @entity35 , 40 , and a woman who said @entity35 raped her when she was 19			1
@entity35 said it was consensual			0
the @entity0 does not identify people who claim to be victims of sexual assault			0
in making his custody and visitation rulings , the judge said the suspicions about the deaths of @entity96 and @entity28 were no concern to him , describing it as ' smoke that 's been blown that i can see through			0
' @entity39 said she wants to expose what went wrong and led to her son 's death			0
' i knew how bad this could get			0
... if the laws are not designed to protect children , then they need to be changed , ' she wrote about the custody ruling on a blog she maintains			0
' in my son 's case , it appears as though death was the only threshold for denial of visitation			0
