but to palaeontologists , this fearsome - looking dinosaur is a new kid on the block			2
the previously unknown species , @entity11 , was unearthed in @entity14 ’s vast @entity13 desert and has been nicknamed the ‘ devil dinosaur ’ due to the long horns that curve forward over its eyes			1
palaeontologists from @entity20 and @entity13 have discovered the 76 million - year - old fossils of a devil - like dinosaur called @entity24 , pictured			1
this artist 's impression shows what it would have looked like with curved horns above its eyes and a large nose this skull reconstruction was based on the fossils of the @entity24 discovered in @entity13			1
the dinosaur is thought to have been a cousin of the @entity36 and has similar features including the curved nose it is thought these were used as a threat to establish dominance over other males – and possibly as weapons in combat			1
believed to be the cousin of the @entity36 , the reptile had an oversized snout and a bony frill at the base of its head			1
scientists estimate it was 15ft long and weighed roughly 2.5 tons			1
researchers from @entity20 and @entity13 universities discovered the dinosaur ’s skull and other fossil bones while excavating in the @entity60 area of southern @entity13			2
the huge beast is believed to have lived in @entity62 , a landmass formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of @entity14 , splitting west and east for millions of years			0
@entity62 stretched from @entity67 to @entity68 during the @entity69			0
the long - horned dinosaur is thought to be a cousin of the @entity36			1
the name @entity24 is @entity73 for big nosed horned face			1
palaeontologists believe the creature was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes			1
it lived around 76 million years ago			0
a clay model was then made from the skull and artists ’ impressions highlight the plant - eating creature ’s unusual features			0
the huge beast is believed to have inhabited @entity62 , a landmass formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of @entity14 , splitting west and east for millions of years			0
the bony frill , rather than possessing elaborate ornamentations such as hooks or spikes , was relatively simple and unadorned			0
@entity24 , @entity73 for big nosed horned face , was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes			1
it lived around 76 million years ago in a region that stretched from @entity67 to @entity68 during the @entity69			0
the badlands , so called because of the dry , unusable terrain , would have been swampy and subtropical			0
horned dinosaurs , or ' ceratopsids ' , were a group of large , four footed plant eaters that were around with @entity100 up until an asteroid strike wiped them all out 65 million years ago			2
researchers from @entity13 used the fossils to create a skull reconstruction out of clay			0
they believe the creature was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes			1
it was a horned dinosaur , or ' ceratopsid ' , which were a group of large , four - footed plant eaters dr @entity110 , from the @entity111 who described the dinosaur in the @entity113 , said : ' the jumbo sized schnoz of @entity24 likely had nothing to do with a heightened sense of smell since olfactory receptors occur further back in the head , adjacent to the brain , and the function of this bizarre feature remains uncertain			1
' instead , the horns and frills on these creatures are believed to have been for intimdating other males and attracting members of the opposite sex - much like peacocks do with their tails , and deers do with their antlers today			2
dr @entity133 , of the @entity134 of @entity13 , added : ' the amazing horns of @entity24 were most likely used as visual signals of dominance and , when that was not enough , as weapons for combatting rivals			1
' the fossils were discovered in the @entity60 in @entity13 by researchers from the @entity143 , pictured			0
the 15ft beast is believed to have inhabited @entity62 , a landmass formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of @entity14 , splitting west and east for millions of years based on the fossil findings , artist @entity149 created this drawing of the @entity24 ' skeleton			1
the dinosaur 's horns are believed to have been used for intimidating other males as well as attracting members of the opposite sex in @entity62 , which was about the area of @entity160 , there may have been more than two dozen giant dinosaurs on a landmass a quarter the size			2
these @entity24 drawings are by artist @entity165			2
it shows the underside of the dinosaur 's skull as well its head in profile dr @entity133 said : ' we are still working to figure out how so many different kinds of giant animals managed to coexist on such a small landmass			0
' during the past twelve years more than a dozen new dinosaurs have been found in the desert known as @entity60 ( @entity179 )			0
as well as @entity24 , the collection includes plant eaters such as duck billed hadrosaurs , armoured ankylosaurs , dome headed pachycephalosaurs and two other horned beasts @entity188 and @entity189			1
there have also been carnivorous dinosaurs from small ' raptor - like ' predators to a megasized tyrannosaur called @entity194			0
this has added strong support for a relatively fresh hypothesis of ' dinosaur provincialism ' - isolated communities of giant dinosaurs			0
dr @entity201 , of the @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity204 , said : ' @entity24 is one of a recent landslide of ceratopsid discoveries , which together have established these giant plant eaters as the most diverse dinosaur group on @entity62			2
' dr @entity210 from the @entity134 of @entity13 continued : ' @entity24 is a wondrous example of just how much more we have to learn about the world of dinosaurs			2
many more exciting fossils await discovery in @entity60			0

the @entity24 is thought to be a cousin of the @entity36
it had two large curved horns above its eyes and a long nose
the dinosaur would have been 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes
its name *translates* from @entity73 to ' big nosed horned face '
