@entity0 yesterday dropped any mention of @entity3 ’s vast budget deficit , immigration and welfare from his final party conference speech before the @entity7			1
instead , the @entity9 leader put an assault on the wealthy and more cash for the @entity12 at the heart of a statist bid for power			1

on welfare , mr @entity0 also neglected to say that all who can work ‘ have a responsibility to do so ’			1
aides said the speech , delivered without notes , had ‘ changed ’ as it was being delivered			1

‘ friends , it is time we ran the country like we know it can be run , ’ mr @entity0 said in the 68 - minute speech			1
the @entity9 leader , who used the word ‘ together ’ 47 times , said he aimed to ‘ restore people ’s faith in the future ’			1
‘ i ’m not talking about changing a policy , or simply a different programme			0
but something that is bigger : transforming the idea , the ethic , of how our country is run			0
‘ what people across @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , across every part of the @entity3 , are saying is this country does n’t care about me			0
' the economy does n’t work			0
and they are not wrong			0
but this @entity9 has a plan to put it right			2
’ mr @entity0 also reeled off a list of people and organisations he said he had ‘ stood up to ’ , including @entity139 over phone hacking , banks over bonuses , payday lenders and energy companies over their profits and the @entity147 when it ran an article about his father ’s views			1

the pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it			0
last night @entity9 mp for @entity165 @entity164 said mr @entity0 appeared to have a ‘ mental block ’ on immigration and welfare			1
‘ he talks a lot in his speech about meeting @entity171 and @entity172 and others in the park or the pub , ’ he said			2
‘ it seems strange that none of them he ’s met have mentioned immigration and welfare			2
‘ you do wonder if he has a mental block about talking about these issues			0

‘ the keys of @entity192 are within his grasp , ’ he said			0
but @entity194 , the conservative party chairman , said : ‘ all @entity0 offers is more wasteful spending , more borrowing and more taxes			1
' you ca n’t fund the @entity12 if you lose control of the nation ’s finances and bankrupt the economy like @entity9 did last time			2
’ a @entity9 government will hit thousands of pubs and clubs with a late - night - opening tax – in a blunt admission of the chaos caused by its 24 - hour drinking laws			1
