this is the moment a weatherman was left with a sore arm after wrestling with a playful dog live on air during his morning broadcast			1
@entity8 , a weatherman in @entity9 , @entity10 , was game for a laugh when he decided to do his broadcast with @entity14 the dog who made the phrase ' never work with kids or animals ' ring true			1
it starts off tamely enough , as @entity14 , an 18 - month - old mastiff mix appears alongside him on @entity23			2
but it soon descends into chaos			0
@entity8 said : ' this is going to be a challenge			2
' he then calmly introduces ripple to viewers and says the dog is just a year - and - a - half old and wants to play			2
' sit ripple , sit , @entity44 ! sit , sit , no , @entity44 's not sitting that 's for sure , ' he said			0
he then valiantly tells viewers that the temperature is currently three degrees , as the dog tugs at his leash , appearing to want to bite through it			0
extreme conditions : for a few seconds , @entity8 tries , in vain , to get through the rest of his report tugged : but @entity14 has already decided to tug him to the right of the screen during the hilarious broadcast biting : he battles , in vain , to calm @entity61 down as the dog bites through his red leash live on air @entity8 said jokingly : ' @entity44 wants to play , right @entity14 ? ' he then wraps the dog leash around his hand and tells viewers about cold spots in @entity69 , as he clutches the bright red leash in his left hand			1
for a few seconds , he tries , in vain , to get through the rest of his report , and at one point , he looks down a @entity44 and asks him ' are you having fun there ? ' suddenly @entity44 decides that this is his chance to wriggle free of the weatherman			0
he begins frantically twisting and turning , forcing @entity8 to turn as well			0
viewers watch as the dog yanks @entity84 so hard that the weatherman is forced to laugh loudly as he tries to give the weather forecast alongside the dog			1
but the @entity10 broadcaster is such a professional that he never once stopped giving his report			1
rough conditions : as @entity8 attempts to give the next seven days ' forecast things get blustery in the studio forecast : the broadcast ends with the dog jumping up on him and pushing him backwards he shouts : ' no ' in between fits of giggles to @entity44 the dog			1
however , @entity14 , still baring his teeth , and trying to chew through his leash is n't having any of it			1
finally , the weatherman says ' alright , alright , alright ' as he tries to calm @entity14 down			1
he then talks to someone off camera saying : ' okay , you 're going to be able to hold him better ? ' @entity8 then goes back to his weather forecast to talk about calm conditions at @entity107 , despite there being rather turbulent conditions in the studio			2
as he gets to the 7 day forecast he jokes : ' okay we 've got to move quickly through this ! ' as the dog continues to struggle to break free			0
suddenly , @entity8 realizes that the dog has actually managed to chew right through his leash , leaving the weatherman with just the end of it wrapped around his hands			1
he looks down in shock and then admits defeat as the entire studio crew bursts into laughter			0
' he broke it , ' he laughs , ' alright you 're on your own ' he tells the dog shooing him away			0
' here , do you want to play with this ? ' he adds holding up the leash to the dog			2
ripple decides this is the perfect opportunity to jump up and push @entity84 several times as the weatherman , simultaneously tries to do the weather report and wrestle , unsuccessfully , with the dog			1
the broadcast ends with the dog jumping up on him and pushing him backwards			0
both the weatherman and dog are thought to be fine .			0

he attempted to give a full weather report with a dog who wanted to play
