by @entity1 reporter published : 06:39 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 06:41 est , 18 june 2013 these two bangles that could be mistaken for cheap glow - bands have sold for an incredible £ 3.7million pounds			1
the bright green bands are a far cry from the plastic bracelets commonly seen in nightclubs and are actually made from an extremely rare gemstone			1
they were carved from a huge piece of jadeite found in @entity12 , which is the most expensive and rarest form of the gemstone jade			1
jade a fortune : the bangles were carved from a huge piece of jadeite , which is the most expensive and rarest form of the gemstone jade as almost all of the world 's jadeite is found in the small country , the mines have been exhausted and top quality pieces now sell for huge sums of money			1
the bracelets , which are just two inches in diameter , are a translucent green colour , which is a shade considered to be one of the most prized forms of the precious stone			2
they were purchased by a phone bidder at the @entity38 sale in @entity39 for an all - in fee of £ 3,732,365			2
@entity41 , director of the jewellery department , said : ' around 99 per cent of the top quality jadeite is only found in @entity12 , including this pair of jadeite bangles			1
' as the supply of high grade jade keeps dropping and the mines are being exhausted , exquisite jadeites become highly sought after			1
' they were carved from the same piece of rough and each highly translucent cylindrical jadeite bangle is suffused with a rich bright green colour			2
going , going , gone : a screen at the auction house shows the final price the bangles went for ' their size is large and as they were carved from the same rough , it would have had to be very big so that there was enough material to carve two similar bangles			0
' the two bangles have a fine texture and translucent with very few impurities , the most desired quality of jadeite			0
' it is so rare to find a big rough with very fine quality texture			0
' they are top quality and when they are carved from the same piece of rough they are invaluable jewels			0
' as its appreciation overtakes that of diamond and gold , this makes jadeite greatly favoured among the wealthy who regard it as one of the major investment items			0
' the beauty , rarity and unique locality of fine jadeite contribute to its collectible value			0

@entity94 is the rarest form of the gemstone jade , mainly found in @entity12
as mines have become depleted , the value has *rocketed*
