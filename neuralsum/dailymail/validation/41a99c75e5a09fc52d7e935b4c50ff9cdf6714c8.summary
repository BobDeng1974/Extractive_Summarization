they describe themselves as the ‘ only gays in the village ’			0
and civil partners @entity4 and @entity6 have become embroiled in a bizarre spat that seems almost worthy of tv ’s @entity8			1
the couple have accused their neighbour , a parish council veteran , of triggering a vendetta against them over a parking space next to their £ 850,000 thatched cottage in the picturesque village of @entity19			1
in a further twist , their neighbour @entity21 admits creating a log bench for himself directly behind their house where he often sits facing their bedroom			2
but he told the @entity43 he has nothing against gay people , saying he is on chatting terms with a lesbian blacksmith and once went to parties at mr @entity4 ’s house featuring ‘ butlers in the buff wearing nothing except little aprons and bow ties ’			1
the colourful row has shattered the genteel tranquillity of the @entity25 village , with its medieval church and riverside green			1
@entity21 ( pictured ) denies being homophobic - but admits he built a bench directly behind their house neighbours at war : mr @entity21 's house ( pictured left ) and mr @entity6 and mr @entity4 's house ( right ) mr @entity4 , 53 , moved in to his 18th - century cottage more than a decade ago , and later received planning permission to double its size			1
but over the years tensions developed between him and mr @entity21			2
the 66 - year - old retired mechanical engineer , whose family has been in the village for generations , is said to have started a one - man campaign to convince mr @entity4 and his partner their parking area was really part of the village green			1
the couple claim he prompted his ‘ drinking buddies ’ on the parish council to launch a ‘ homophobic vendetta ’ against them			1
they say the council has spent nearly £ 7,000 – 20 per cent of its annual budget – on a legal bid to take away part of their parking space			1
the row came to a head last week when police were called after a councillor turned up at their house with a contractor to erect a fence that would have reduced the size of the parking area			1
mr @entity4 said : ‘ when i told them they had no right to put the fence there the contractor shouted homophobic abuse at me and pushed me against a car , which @entity6 managed to film			1
' my glasses were broken and i was hurt and shocked			0
mr @entity4 ( left ) moved in to the cottage more than a decade ago and later doubled it in size the couple claim mr @entity21 made his ‘ drinking buddies ’ on the parish council launch a ‘ homophobic vendetta ’ against them - and the council has spent 20 per cent of its budget on a bid to take away part of their parking ‘ the parish councillor just stood there			1
the police turned up and went away with the contractor to question him about my report of a homophobic assault			2
’ he added : ‘ mr @entity21 has complained about everything we ’ve done – and drinking buddies on the council always back him up			2
‘ he ’s also used a chainsaw to make himself a bench on the riverbank behind our garden , facing our bedroom , which seems a bit pervy and an invasion of our privacy			0
’ he said mr @entity21 ’s behaviour had left him and his partner feeling intimidated			2
‘ we ’ve made a beautiful house in keeping with its 200 years of history , ’ he added			0
‘ i do n’t understand why there ’s all this hatred			0
' we think it can only be because we ’re the only gays in the village			0
’ mr @entity4 said the problem began when the parish council suddenly registered a new plan of its village green land , and began clearing an overgrown patch next to his garden – while claiming that he had unlawfully extended his boundary			1
‘ it was around that time that mr @entity21 decided to go back on the parish council , ’ he said			1
‘ they ’ve since spent almost £ 7,000 in legal fees and other costs on trying to take a few feet of land off us			0
' it ’s a fifth of the council ’s annual budget			0
they ’ve taken down a fence we had up , although the land has been part of the cottage for decades with no complaints			0
’ but mr @entity21 insisted that the council was right to take action over an attempt to ‘ steal ’ land from the green			1
and he said he had also phoned the police after mr @entity4 called his wife a ‘ witch ’			2
the controversial log bench - mr @entity4 said it ' seems a bit pervy and is an invasion of our privacy ’ he told the @entity43 the trouble started when mr @entity4 began extending his cottage , encroaching on public land			2
threatening to sue over claims he is homophobic , mr @entity21 said that he and his wife @entity197 had welcomed mr @entity4 to the village , adding : ‘ he and his partner were guests at our daughter ’s wedding			1
‘ and as he used to be married to a woman he has three children and we treated them like grandchildren , giving them presents and letting them play in our garden			0
' we went to a number of parties at his house where 90 per cent of the guests were gay couples and butlers in the buff			0
' it is incorrect to say i ’m homophobic			0
there are other people in the village who are basically gay or homosexual or whatever you want to call it			2
' i ’m very friendly with a lesbian blacksmith			0
but he is basically stealing land from the parish , and that is not right			0
’ mr @entity21 said he had resigned as a councillor after mr @entity4 alleged that he was behind the boundary dispute with the parish , which he denies			1
he claimed his neighbour was ‘ just crying homophobia because he ’s not getting his own way ’ , adding : ‘ he provoked the incident with the contractor , who i feel sorry for			0
and i had to call the police when he called my wife a witch			0
’ the contractor denies a homophobic assault on mr @entity4			1
@entity245 , the clerk of @entity246 , said : ‘ the council does have a boundary dispute , but it is in the hands of lawyers and we can not openly discuss it			0
' there is not , however , a homophobic vendetta against the couple involved , and the councillors are very upset at the suggestion ’			2
a police spokesman said investigations were continuing			0
the ‘ only gay in the village ’ was a catchphrase used in @entity264 comedy @entity8 by @entity265 , a ‘ committed homosexualist ’ who pranced around a small @entity269 town dressed in black rubber			0
mr @entity4 ( pictured right with his partner @entity6 ) said mr @entity21 ’s behaviour has left them feeling intimidated			1
