by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 21 january 2013 as if @entity3 in north @entity4 with its gravestones and lonely walkways were not scary enough , now a rare species of giant spider has been discovered lurking in its lightless vaults			1
staff at @entity9 came across a population of the @entity11 , or orb weaver spiders , when working on a bat survey in december			1
the identity of the spider , which requires darkness so total that even night is too bright for it , was confirmed by @entity18 , @entity19 at the @entity20			1
the rare orb weaver spider spans 30 mm across - including all eight of its legs - and shuns any form of light the spiders - among the largest found in @entity27 - were discovered in the vaults of the @entity29 at the cemetery			1
sometimes known as ' cave spiders ' , the @entity32 , or orb weaving spider , is found in places of complete darkness , including cellars , ice houses - and now vaults in graveyards			1
but although the adult spiders shun the light , baby spiders , or spiderlings , actively seek it out			2
this means that they can emerge from their dark birthplace and find new spaces to colonise			0
the spider is about 30 mm across , including its legs			1
that makes it comparable to @entity50 ( the large spider often found in the bath ) and is probably slightly larger			1
the trust said that the spiders , which ( including their legs ) measure 30mm across , could have been living undetected in the vaults for at least 150 years			0
the sealed vaults , which are designed to hold up to 12 coffins , are the perfect breeding ground for the shy spiders because they are so rarely opened , said the trust			0
@entity29 is at the heart of the cemetery			0
it consists of 16 vaults on either side of a broad passageway , which is entered via a great arch. the vaults were bought by individual families for their sole use			0
the orb spiders are not the first rare species to be found at the cemetery : @entity9 said that researchers have found 227 other species previously unrecorded at the graveyard			1
@entity3 , with its spooky graves and monolithic structures , was created in 1836 , along with other graveyards around @entity4 , in an attempt to deal with the growing problem of how to dispose of the capital 's dead the grand north @entity4 cemetery is the final resting place of such diverse luminaries as @entity89 ( left ) and @entity90 , a founding father of @entity92 @entity93 is one of the seven great burial grounds created in the 1830s when @entity4 became so overcrowded that there was little room left to bury the dead			0
@entity93 attracted a varied clientele and over the next 20 years became one of the capital â€™s most fashionable cemeteries			0
it is the final resting place of notables as varied as the writers @entity105 and @entity107 , as well as tv star @entity108 , @entity89 , who discovered the @entity109 , and @entity90			0
burials are still carried out at the cemetery , which sees up to 70 funerals a year			0
despite their alarming size , meta spiders help us by eating woodlice and small insects			0
the cemetery is n't the only place the spiders have been found in @entity27 : researchers have found males of the species close to the ancient oak trees of @entity124 , which suggests that they had made the dark , damp spaces within the trees themselves their home			1
the spiders have also been found in the @entity131 , as well as in @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			2
they have also been found in @entity136 and in @entity137			2
@entity138 of the @entity9 said : ' the discovery of this important spider population in the heart of @entity4 shows just how valuable cemeteries such as @entity93 can be in providing refuges for wildlife			2

@entity147 weaver spider needs darkness so total that even night is too bright
rare @entity32 spider is one of the largest found in @entity27
