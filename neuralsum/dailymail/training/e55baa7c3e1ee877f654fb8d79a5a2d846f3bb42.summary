home secretary @entity2 has taken a tough new line on @entity5 migrants , amid reports of a major @entity8 split over how to respond to the triumph of @entity10 , led by @entity22 , pictured right , in the election the @entity8 are under pressure after @entity22 ’s triumph at last week ’s @entity27 elections			1
ministers have already said they would restrict migration from new @entity5 states until their country ’s economy was in line with @entity34 ’s			1
but mrs may is said to also be pressing to limit migrants from existing member states			1
this would allow migrants from developed countries such as @entity40 , but block those from poorer countries such as @entity42 and @entity43			1
mrs may said : ‘ we need to reduce the abuse in free movement and we do need to look at free movement			2
’ campaigning in @entity48 , mrs may added : ‘ i recognise the concern people have shown on immigration			2
’ she went on that she was working ‘ across the board to deal with abuse , to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live here , and [ to ] reduce the pull - factors for people coming here from the @entity5 '			1
former @entity8 cabinet minister @entity59 has warned that uncontrolled immigration will have ' serious consequences ' for society a report in @entity64 yesterday claimed mr @entity17 has moved to block tougher controls , saying such a move would be ‘ undeliverable ’			1
but a @entity68 spokesman said : ‘ there is no disagreement between the prime minister , the home secretary and the foreign secretary			1
’ meanwhile , former @entity8 cabinet minister @entity59 warned last night that uncontrolled immigration will have ‘ serious consequences ’ for society			1
lord @entity59 criticised claims by former labour cabinet ministers @entity78 and @entity79 this week , saying they exaggerated the economic benefits of immigration			2
the @entity86 former ministers made the pro-immigration case , writing : ‘ instead of preparing to concede yet more ground on the issue , mr @entity82 should have the courage of his convictions and come out fighting			0
’ they said the @entity95 leader must not ‘ retreat in the face of the myths and fears of anti-immigrationists ’			0
@entity59 , the chancellor under @entity96 , dismissed their views in a letter to the @entity101 newspaper			0
he cited a @entity103 report that found ‘ no evidence			0
that immigration generates significant economic benefit ’			0
he also rubbished the claim that migrants were a ‘ bulwark against an ageing population ’			2
this , he said , would lead to a need for ‘ ever escalating levels of immigration ’			0
lord @entity59 added : ‘ i am entirely in favour of an open economy such as we have enjoyed for decades , but that does not require massive immigration			0
‘ to dismiss genuine and justified concerns as “ myths and fears ” is to play into the hands of extremists			0
‘ it is not a more stringent immigration policy which would have ' serious consequences for the wellbeing of our economy and society ' , as they claim			0
on the contrary , it is failure to respond to the clear and consistent wishes of three - quarters of our population			0
