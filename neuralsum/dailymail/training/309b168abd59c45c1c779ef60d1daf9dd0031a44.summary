@entity1 's footballers have yet to get back on track with the public after their woeful @entity4 but at least @entity5 are prepared to go out of their way for @entity8 ’s squad			1
travellers from @entity10 to @entity11 who had booked first - class seats in the two most convenient carriages , were surprised to be relocated because of a block booking			0
then the service stopped unexpectedly at @entity17 for the @entity1 party , who were on the way to a rare training stay at @entity22 in @entity23 , to board			2
they later disembarked at @entity25 , another unscheduled port of call			0
the train announcer made no apology for running 12 minutes late due to looking after @entity1 ’s needs			1
the @entity30 said fans would approve of @entity1 travelling on public transport and it was an issue for @entity5 where the train stopped			1
time : @entity5 experienced delays to their service as one of their trains made extra stops for the @entity1 squad a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we try to accommodate the requirements of the @entity1 team when we can and we do n’t broadcast when they travel with us for security reasons			1
we apologise if any of our customers were inconvenienced			0
’ lncreasingly irrational @entity48 pundit @entity47 seems to have got the wrong message from @entity51 approaches last may as to whether he would be available for @entity53 duties this season			1
@entity47 announced it as a job offer , saying he received a ‘ welcome aboard ’ tweet from @entity58			1
however the @entity51 confirmed yesterday that @entity47 was only one of many being sounded out and that they have no current plans to use him on @entity61 programmes			1
captain : the @entity63 came out in support of @entity65 saying : ' do n't sack him - back him ' eyebrows were raised around the cricket circuit after the @entity63 , who look after all members of the players union , gave strong public support to @entity1 ’s beleaguered one - day captain @entity65			2
the @entity63 posted a number of tweets with the hashtag ‘ do n’t sack him — back him ’ detailing why @entity65 should remain at the helm of the 50 - over side despite their dismal run of results			0
the campaign had the endorsement of @entity63 chief executive @entity84 , who said : ‘ we historically back the incumbent captain and we wanted to demonstrate that with @entity65 having had such a difficult summer			0
we do n’t feel it is inappropriate			0
’ there is understood to be further tension at @entity91 in the fall - out from their pantomime deadline day coverage			1
newcomer @entity95 was chosen to work alongside @entity96 and @entity97 on the flagship programme , which is believed to have upset some of the established presenters			0
verdict : @entity101 address the background to @entity103 replacing @entity104 at @entity105 sir @entity106 , famous for sitting on the fence as a pundit , will nevertheless address the background to @entity103 replacing @entity104 as @entity105 manager in 1994 in his updated autobiography to be published this month			1
rather than give an opinion , @entity106 details the events surrounding the sensitive change			2
sir @entity101 is a close friend of @entity104 and has always taken his side			0
indeed , there are those who believe his presence at the @entity30 would have made it very difficult for @entity103 to become @entity1 manager			1
@entity106 , now retired , glowingly described @entity104 in the @entity122 programme this week as ‘ a colossus , a top , top man and an absolute leader			2
’ @entity122 : @entity1 vs @entity127 was watched by fewer people on television and at @entity122 the @entity30 sadly will not throw the book at referee grandee @entity131 for making a ghastly racist comment			2
but window - dressing anti-discrimination initiatives to help black players and others from ethnic minority backgrounds develop careers after football will see former @entity140 forward @entity139 observe @entity30 board meetings and @entity142 attend the @entity144 ones			0
wednesday 's non-event against @entity127 , watched by the new @entity122 ’s lowest crowd for an @entity1 international , did however attract a reasonable peak viewing audience of 5.6m on @entity150 , although the 4.5m average was 1m down on recent friendlies			0
@entity150 , with exclusive rights to all @entity1 ’s games until november 2017 , should have concerns if ratings for next monday ’s @entity158 qualifier in @entity159 — the most attractive game of the group — are not considerably higher .			0

@entity8 and @entity1 squad caused delays on @entity5 train
@entity47 *prematurely* *suggested* he had been offered @entity51 job
sir @entity106 speaks on @entity103
transfer deadline day causes *bickering* at @entity91
