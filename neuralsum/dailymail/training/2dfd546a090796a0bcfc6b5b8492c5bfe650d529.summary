by @entity0 a @entity2 - based entreprenuer has come up with something worth getting egg - cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell			1
the £ 10 ( $ 17 ) contraption gently spins the egg , blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself			1
the already - scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator , @entity14 , claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs			1
pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin , mixing the egg 's contents without damaging the fragile shell			1
mr @entity14 is currently seeking funding for the product , named @entity30 , on crowdsourcing website @entity31 and if successful plans to launch the product later this year			0
it 's no yolk : a @entity2 - based entreprenuer has invented a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its shell egg - cellent system : pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin , mixing the egg 's contents cracking invention : @entity14 , a 37 - year - old industrial designer , said the idea for the goose gadget came about after he found a video online in which a guy claims to make an in - shell scrambled egg with a tea towel the gadget works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth.pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin , mixing the egg 's contents without damaging the fragile shell			1
because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there , air does n’t get into the egg			2
‘ the result is a much creamier , custardy tasting egg which is far superior to normal scrambled eggs , ’ said mr @entity14			1
mr @entity14 , 37 , who is an industrial designer , said : ‘ the idea for the @entity30 all started when i found a video online in which a guy claimed to make an in - shell scrambled egg with a tea towel			1
‘ i did n't believe it could be done so i decided i had to give it a go			0
i quickly used up all the eggs in my fridge and not one attempt was successful			0
‘ something sparked inside me and i became obsessed with trying to find an easy way of scrambling an egg in its shell every time			0
‘ i remembered seeing a @entity84 child 's game that involves pulling two cords apart to spin a disc and thought i could apply the same principals in my design			2
eggs - traordinary : the gadget works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth			2
because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there , air does n’t get into the egg			2
the result is a much creamier , custardy taste sunny side up : ‘ ‘ in the culinary world people are always looking to create different flavour profiles using the chemistry of cooking and this is exactly what the goose does ’ , said @entity2 - based inventor @entity14 @entity107 special : gadget took a year to create and is raising funds for development on @entity31 ‘ i worked on the @entity30 for one year before i finally got the finished product			1
the result is a gadget that can fit any egg in and is guaranteed not to break the shell			0
