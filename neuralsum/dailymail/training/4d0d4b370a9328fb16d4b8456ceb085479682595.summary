missy the penguin will claim the crown as the oldest in the world after reaching 36 years old - a staggering 108 in human years			2
the ancient king penguin arrived at the @entity18 wildlife park in @entity19 when she was at least five years old in 1982 - and despite losing the sight in one eye she is still the leader of the colony today			1
keepers had no idea that she was the world 's oldest until a zoo in @entity26 claimed the title with a @entity29 penguin two years younger than @entity2			2
staff at @entity18 , in @entity32 are now planning to send her details to the @entity34 to prove she has smashed the record			0
king penguins - @entity36 in @entity38 - are only expected to live up to 26 years in captivity , much more than the 15 - 20 years life expectancy in the wild			1

' the fact that she can only see out of one eye does n't appear to have slowed her down at all			0
