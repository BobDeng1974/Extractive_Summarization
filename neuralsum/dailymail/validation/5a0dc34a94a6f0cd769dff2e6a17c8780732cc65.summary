the ladies who lunch at the @entity3 of the @entity4 were oblivious that one of the most decorated @entity7 footballers had just strolled in			1
at 6ft 4in , @entity10 and @entity11 centre - back @entity8 ought to be hard to miss , especially when he is the national team ’s vice-captain , having picked up pretty much every club honour in the game			1
win the @entity15 in may and he will have the full set - following @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 success in little more than three years			1
yet he goes relatively unnoticed while the likes of @entity22 , or his old @entity10 team - mate @entity23 , both with similar achievements to their name , would be stopped in their tracks			1
@entity8 went relatively unnoticed during an interview with the @entity28 at the pennyhill park hotel @entity10 defender @entity8 has picked up nearly every club honour in the game , including the @entity16 ‘ if you ’d said to me four or five years ago i would be in this position i ’d have snapped your hands off , ’ says @entity8 , 29			1
‘ it ’s an amazing feeling			1
i often think about how lucky i am and how so many people would love to be in this position			2
’ since arriving at @entity40 from @entity41 in january 2012 , the medals and trophies have simply kept on coming			2
‘ moving to @entity10 has been such a success in terms of the titles i have won in three years , ’ he says			1
‘ the winning mentality of the club rubs off on the players and you just want to win even more			2
’ @entity8 poses with the @entity16 trophy and the @entity18 after @entity10 completed the double in 2012 the former @entity41 and @entity53 centre back holds aloft the @entity17 trophy in @entity55 a year later a week ago , @entity8 added a @entity20 winner ’s medal as @entity10 clinched the first major silverware of season in a 2 - 0 victory over @entity61 at @entity62			1
‘ it was almost like the lads were bouncing into training the following day , ’ he recalls			2
‘ winning anything is special to [ @entity67 ] @entity66			2
it ’s his first trophy since he returned			2
‘ there was very little celebration considering we had just won a competition			1
my family had come down from the north to watch the game and they all stayed at my house			2
there ’s no better feeling than driving home from @entity62 to my family at home			2
’ @entity8 added the @entity20 trophy to his haul last week as @entity10 defeated @entity61 2 - 0 at @entity62 @entity10 boss @entity66 is all smiles as he and his team celebrate after landing their latest silverware @entity8 ( centre ) appears highly amused as @entity66 throws himself to the floor during the celebrations but with the @entity16 and @entity15 high on @entity10 ’s agenda , it is ‘ back to business ’ as @entity8 says			1
@entity66 keeps stoking up the warrior - like instincts in his team and @entity8 believes that , aside from the manager ’s meticulous pre-match planning , two key elements are contributing to the team ’s success this season			1
‘ we ’ve learned from our experiences , ’ he says			2
‘ we played several teams last season where people expected us to get results but we did n’t			2
having that in the back of your mind going into the season has helped , you do n’t want to go through that again — you do n’t want to waste opportunities			0
’ the second key factor is the quality of signings who joined the club in the past two transfer windows — including @entity120 and one of the best strikers in @entity123 , @entity124			0
@entity8 says @entity10 learnt from setbacks last season and insists the club do not want to waste opportunities @entity124 arrived at @entity10 from @entity127 and is one of the @entity15 's most - feared strikers former @entity130 midfielder @entity120 , signed from @entity131 , has formed a connection with @entity124 ‘ @entity124 has come in and although he hardly speaks any @entity7 , had never played in this league before and has never lived in this country , he had an impact from the word go			1
‘ @entity138 and again players come over and take a long time to settle down and get into the groove of the @entity15 but it has n’t fazed him			1
he ’s one of the liveliest jokers in the changing room			0
he ’s certainly entertaining and he has settled into the group really well			0
‘ with @entity120 , everyone knew his quality and he has played in this league before so in a way it was easy for him to come back			0
but still , he has come into the side like he has never been away and the connection @entity124 and @entity120 have had this season has been fantastic for us			0
‘ there ’s also the likes of @entity156 , who has come in and done tremendously well			0
there ’s a real fight on at left - back			0
it ’s one of those positions where we ’re blessed			0
you know whoever plays is going to do the job			0
‘ @entity165 is another great talent , he listens to everybody and he takes on advice			0
he ’s a nice lad and a fantastic player			0
playing at a club like @entity10 and being given the opportunity to play with the world - class players that we have means you can learn from them and improve your game			1
’ @entity10 centre backs @entity8 , captain @entity22 and @entity165 celebrate together at @entity62 @entity8 had to take some flak after @entity61 ’s @entity181 inspired a 5 - 3 win over @entity10 on @entity183 , but he takes such criticism as ‘ part and parcel of the game , ’ and points out that ‘ there is n’t a footballer on the planet who has n’t received negative press ’ at some stage in their career			1
‘ you need to have a thick skin at times , especially at the highest level			0
i am constantly analysing my performances and i tend to focus more on things i have n’t done as well as i ’d have liked			0
i always look to improve and that ’s what ’s got me to where i am today			0
’ @entity8 ’s greatest day in @entity10 colours came in the @entity16 victory over @entity206 in 2012			1
now he is playing his part in their bid to repeat the feat , and his magnificently timed flick , from a @entity22 cross , led to @entity214 ’s header putting @entity10 in front against @entity216 at the @entity217 in the first leg of their last 16 tie last month			1
@entity214 celebrates after scoring for @entity10 against @entity216 in the @entity16 @entity8 's flick from @entity22 's cross at the @entity217 led to @entity214 's important goal in the @entity224 capital ‘ it was a crazy situation because we found all three of us in the box and nobody else , ’ recalls @entity8			1
‘ @entity22 played it to me and i knew @entity214 was coming in behind me			0
i could n’t score from that angle so i tried to help it on and he did the rest			0
’ on wednesday , @entity10 host @entity216 in the return leg , with the tie 1 - 1 , and it ’s a mouthwatering challenge			1
‘ it ’s got that final - feel about it because if you lose the game you ’re out — and you have to really push hard to win the game			0
the atmosphere on @entity245 nights is something special and that ’s another positive with the second leg being played at home , the fans are our 12th man			0
have we got the squad and the players to win it again ? yes we have			0

@entity8 has won @entity16 and @entity17 with @entity10
the defender has also landed the @entity18 and @entity20 with @entity255
@entity11 vice-captain could complete set with @entity15 title
