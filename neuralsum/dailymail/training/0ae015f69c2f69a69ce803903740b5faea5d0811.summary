by @entity0 last updated at 3:43 pm on 3rd september 2011 @entity1 , who died of a single stab wound while four met police officers searched his @entity5 home police who carried out the raid on the home of @entity1 , in which the reggae star allegedly stabbed himself to death , are unlikely to face any charges			1
police claim @entity1 , real name @entity15 , stabbed himself in the heart while officers were searching his home for evidence of drugs trafficking			1
in a confidential letter leaked to the @entity24 , @entity22 commissioner @entity21 told the singer 's family no evidence was found to imply any police misconduct			1
he said : ' the [ @entity22 ] investigation has identified aspects of the operation which were not satisfactory , and criticisms have been made of some of the officer 's actions			1
' however , these do not meet the threshold for misconduct under the police misconduct system			2
' mr @entity15 's family have bitterly criticised the @entity44 officers involved in the incident , none of whom have been suspended			2
they are also angry over the @entity22 's decision to treat the officers as witnesses rather than suspects , meaning they can not be forced to answer questions in a formal interview			1
mr @entity15 's family was told that he stabbed himself while making a cup of tea , despite the presence of officers in his home			2
they question why the four officers involved in the raid handcuffed mr @entity15 after his fatal injury and want to know why the officer in the kitchen at the time refused a direct request by the @entity22 's lead investigator to give a formal interview			1
no justice , no peace : a girl holds a placard on a demonstration questioning the circumstances surrounding the death of @entity1 @entity76 , mr @entity15 's 17 - year - old daughter , told the @entity24 : ' their story just does n't add up and until it does , i ca n't believe that my dad killed himself			0
' the only action the officers can now face is if the @entity44 initiates an ' unsatisfactory performance procedure ' , which can result in dismissal , but which the @entity22 can not direct			1
the teenage daughter of reggae star @entity1 has told of her disbelief at the outcome of the @entity22 investigation into the death of her father			1
@entity76 said her father was a ' calm and spiritual person ' who would never have the kind of outburst police say led to his alleged suicide			2
in an article written for the @entity24 newspaper , the 17 - year - old told how her father was excited about his life and always working towards the future			0
' i ca n't imagine him decideing to throw his future away , whatever was happening to him at any one moment , ' she said			0
' added to all that , he was scared of needles – he hated them – so the idea he would kill himself with a sharp knife seems insane			0
' ms @entity76 said her father 's death has changed her deeply and left her with sleepless nights			0
' until i get to the bottom of it , i wo n't know what peace is , ' she said			0
mr @entity15 , who was 48 , found fame as @entity1 with the @entity115 hits @entity116 and police officer			2
his autobiographical 1984 hit @entity117 tells how he was caught in possession of cannabis but let off when the officer recognised him as a reggae artist			0
@entity122 , @entity1 's nephew , to whom the @entity22 sent the letter outlining the outcome of its investigation , told the @entity126 he was disappointed but not surprised by the decision			1
' if we look historically speaking about the other families [ who have lost relatives in police custody ] we did n't hold out much hope , ' he said			2
' we did think that in the particular unique circumstances in which @entity1 died at least some officers would be found to have questions to answer			0
' he was particularly stinging in his criticism of the @entity22 , saying the police watchdog ' have no real authority to procure justice for the ordinary citizen			1
' since 1990 there have been a total of 940 deaths in police custody , according to the charity inquest			0
' at the end of the day , we would have expected some kind of justice because if they did n't go to his home that morning @entity1 would still be here , ' the younger @entity15 said			0
he added : ' in cases like ours it seems that we just feel like we are up against a great @entity156 and we are not equipped to handle them			0

no police officers have *submitted* to a formal interview
@entity22 *concedes* aspects of the raid were ' unsatisfactory '
@entity165 says he is disappointed but not surprised
