by @entity0 everyone knows that too much sunbathing can cause skin cancer			1
but now research suggests that , in moderation , sunbathing could actually be good for people ’s health			1
a new study has revealed that it could prevent heart attacks			2
sunbathing could reduce the risk of heart attacks , new research suggests it shows that cardiovascular disease is more severe in patients deficient in vitamin d , known as the ' sunshine vitamin '			1
although people are advised not to overdo it because of the risk of skin cancer , the latest finding backs up previous studies suggesting sunshine is good for the heart			1
in the largest analysis to date , vitamin d deficiency was identified in seven in ten patients undergoing coronary angiography - an imaging test used to see how blood flows through the arteries in the heart			2
it was associated with higher prevalence of coronary artery disease , with a 32 per cent higher occurrence in those with the lowest levels			1
there were also almost 20 per cent more severe cases affecting multiple vessels among those with less of the nutrient			0
a progressive increase in heart disease was found according to the severity of vitamin d deficiency			2
people who are deficient in the sunshine vitamin - vitamin d - are more likely to have severe coronary artery disease patients with the lowest levels of vitamin d had nearly double the rate of clogged arteries as those with normal levels			1
cardiologist dr @entity60 , of @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ‘ present results suggest vitamin d deficiency to be the cause rather than the consequence of hardening of the arteries			0
‘ although evidence of benefits with vitamin d supplementation in cardiovascular outcomes are still lacking , strategies to raise natural vitamin d should probably be advised in the prevention of cardiovascular disease			0
’ presenting her work to an @entity80 meeting in @entity81 , she said vitamin d deficiency is an independent risk factor for heart disease			1
but it is still not clear whether adding vitamin d supplements may help reduce that risk			0
her researchers evaluated amounts of the nutrient in 1,484 patients who were considered to have heart disease			0
the extent and severity of their heart disease was measured by a scanning procedure that determines the degree of artery blockage			0
dr @entity60 said eating foods rich in vitamin d such as fish , cereal and eggs and moderate exercise outdoors should be advised in healthy people as well as those with heart disease			1
this is because the nutrient boosts the immune system as well as reducing inflammatory processes that lead to illness			0
the researchers estimate more than half of @entity114 adults are vitamin d deficient , with the highest rates among @entity117 and @entity118			0
in the @entity120 vitamin d deficiency is likely to affect at least half of white adults , up to 90 per cent of the multi ethnic population and a quarter of all children			0
@entity124 is being studied for its possible connection to several diseases and health problems including diabetes , high blood pressure , multiple sclerosis , autoimmune conditions , bone disorders and some types of cancer .			2

@entity124 could be good for heart health , a new study has revealed
coronary artery disease is 32 *%* more likely in people deficient in the vitamin
they are also more likely to have a severe case of the disease
but *experts* urge moderation because of the risk of skin cancer
