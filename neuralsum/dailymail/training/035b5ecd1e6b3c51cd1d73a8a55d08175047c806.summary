by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 declared its independence from the @entity4 on august 17 , 1945 in one of the first acts of post-war decolonisation			1
the colourful independence celebrations draw upon the many traditions of @entity2 culture , including bizarre tests of agility and strength			0
during @entity14 @entity2 had been invaded by @entity15 and following their surrender @entity2 nationalists declared independence			2
initially , the @entity4 resisted the nationalists , holding onto the country they called the @entity22			0
the @entity4 tried to resist the independence movement , eventually accepting defeat after four years following pressure from the @entity26			0
one of the most bizarre parts of the @entity2 independence celebrations is the @entity30 competition where men clamber up greased poles the @entity30 game was introduced to @entity2 by the @entity4 colonists , who placed prizes at the top of the pole during special occasions for entertainment because the poles are covered in grease or oil , one man is unable to clamber up unaided as they are unable to grip and climb at the same time as a result , the men form teams where they help each other on the understanding that they split the goodies from the top of the pole equally in an amazing feat of strength , one man grapples with the base of the pole while his friends use him as a ladder to get to the goodies from the top this man is guiding down a brand new bicycle which has been lowered from the top of the pole by a team mate who managed to scramble to the top in some cases , two or three men will stand on each other 's shoulders as they defy the laws of gravity in a bid to unhook the prizes from the top of the pole as well as bicycles , which are generally the top prize , other gifts include electronic goods , and even food women and children look on from the ground and cheer on their friends and relatives as they try and dislodge the goodies from the top of the pole the men have to co-operate with each other to work their way up the pole , here one of the men wraps his arms and legs to anchor himself , allowing his friend to climb one of the biggest celebrations is in the @entity2 capital of @entity91 , which also features a flypast by members of the @entity2 airforce here one man stands on his friend 's head , while on the right a man tries to climb over his friend who is gripping on half - way up the pole in a remarkable display of dexterity , this man uses his feet to lower this full - size adult 's bicycle from the top of the pole so it wo n't be damaged the poles are nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration and loaded with gifts and secured upright the independence celebration is a major day out for @entity2 families who decorate buildings and homes in the red and white national colours the @entity30 competition is designed to teach young people the importance of working together for the common good but some @entity2 believe that because the tradition was introduced by the @entity4 colonists it should be banned as it is demeaning a more recent objection concerns the large number of nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration the @entity4 colonists introduced the tradition in the 1700s for their own amusement where they would place trinkets at the top of the greased poles unsurprisingly , the strongest man is positioned at the bottom of the human pyramid while the lightest , most agile climber makes his way to the top for those @entity2 who are unable to clamber to the top of a greased pole , another competition involved competitors eating crackers women are not allowed to participate in the pole climbing competition , but they are allowed to take part in a special sack race which is also very popular other competitions involve a marble and spoon race , where participants grip a metal spoon with their teeth and walk while balancing a marble another bizarre game played on independence day is cone football , where players cover their faces with a cone and race around after the ball			1
