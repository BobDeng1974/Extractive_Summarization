by @entity0 agreeing to judge the @entity2 beauty pageant in @entity3 in the run up to the @entity5 was not the toughest decision of my life			1
let me think about this : 21 stunning women , motor racing 's most glamorous event , followed by the @entity5 's most luxurious after - party			0
the winner of miss @entity15 will have the arduous task of sitting aboard the @entity20 120ft tri-deck super-yacht to watch the race from the best spot on the race - track , with @entity24 on tap			1
next , if she is n't too exhausted , it 's off to the @entity20 after - party on the penthouse terrace of @entity30 's nightclub			2
it 's a tough life : this week @entity0 was a judge at the @entity33 beauty pageant , pictured here with two contestants normally , this kind of a-list hospitality package would set you back around £ 10,000 per person , so it 's safe to say that the competition is intense			1
as i arrived , there were gorgeous women limbering up , hair being teased into shape , vertiginous high heels attached , last - minute make - up applied and @entity50 being put on teeth - it 's an old beauty pageant tip to help contestants smile easily			0
i also noticed a couple of rather racy ladies who were wearing little more than some bodypaint			0
race - y ladies : @entity0 looks pleased with himself as he poses with half - naked models tricky decision : @entity0 had some tough choices to make - though we 're sure the margaritas helped celebration time : @entity0 could n't help but get a taste of the action ( left ) and poses with the winner , @entity66 ( right ) a few of the models came over to me before the start to say hello and bat their eyelids , but i made it clear that i would be a totally impartial judge			1
one of them was well over six foot in her heels and towered over me , and was kind enough to slouch in our photo together			0
another contestant 's boyfriend came over ; he was very keen to point out that she was not single			0
with that in mind , i took my seat on the judging panel next to the @entity20 organisers @entity86 and @entity87			2
@entity0 was joined by new made in @entity90 flame @entity88 following the eveningwear round a couple of favourites were way out in front			1
it was a tough decision , but in the end we decided the winner was number 14 , @entity66			0
i think it was her impassioned speech about world peace and loving animals that clinched it - that , and the fact she was absolutely stunning			0
but despite all that , the real winner on the night was the gorgeous model and made in @entity90 newcomer , @entity88 , who rocked up near the end of the night with her friend @entity111			2
i invited @entity88 to go to the @entity20 in @entity15 with me , so hopefully @entity88 will agree to be my miss @entity15			1
lots of love , @entity0			2
