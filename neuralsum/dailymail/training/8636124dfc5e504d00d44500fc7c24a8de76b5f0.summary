@entity1 interim boss @entity0 has confirmed that @entity2 and @entity3 will both be fit for the @entity4			1
there were fears that @entity2 would be ruled out of @entity8 ’s squad for @entity9 after he damaged his left shoulder in tuesday ’s win over @entity12 at @entity13 and was taken to hospital			1
the problem has since been diagnosed as heavy bruising and possible ligament damage			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , has missed the last two games with a groin strain and is unlikely to play in sunday ’s final @entity21 game of the season at @entity23			1
agony : @entity2 looks in real pain after landing awkwardly on tuesday night high hopes : @entity2 challenges @entity12 's @entity27 before going down injured concerns were growing that the injury might be worse than first thought , but @entity0 revealed that @entity3 returned to training on thursday			1
he said : ' @entity2 ’s injury is n’t as bad as i thought on the night			1
he ’s obviously out for sunday but should be ok for the @entity4			2
‘ @entity3 has just started training over the last couple of days			1
sunday probably will be a little be a bit too quick for him but he ’ll train and be fine for the @entity4 also			2
’ the trip to @entity38 ’s will be @entity0 ’s last game in temporary charge as @entity1 prepare to appoint @entity41 next week			1
@entity0 is still undecided over his future at @entity13 , either as a player or possibly part of @entity46 ’s backroom team , but admits that confirmation of the appointment will allow @entity1 to begin a new chapter after a disappointing season			1
asked if he was looking forward to it , he replied : ‘ everyone is			2
it ’s been a difficult season for us and when the management situation gets sorted out then we can move on and that will probably be in the next couple of weeks			2
crocked : @entity3 is likely to miss the final game of the season but will be fit for the @entity4 ‘ there ’s huge speculation but nothing has been announced yet and my job is to prepare the team for @entity23 so that ’s what i ’ll do			1
i ’m sure there ’ll be an announcement soon and maybe i can comment then but at the moment it ’s just speculation so there ’s not a lot i can say			2
’ @entity1 need to win at @entity23 and rely on @entity72 losing at home to @entity74 to clinch sixth place and qualification for the @entity77			2
@entity0 admits that his brief spell in charge has whetted the appetite to go into management when he hangs up his boots			1
‘ there ’s not really a lot of pressure on me at the moment , ’ he added			2
‘ it was four games and we could n’t really win anything			2
we could only qualify for the @entity77 and we ’ll carry on trying to do that			0
‘ you get a little taste of the pressure you ’re put under regarding picking teams and wanting to do your best , so you get a little taste of it			0
@entity97 : @entity0 brought himself on as a substitute in the 3 - 1 win over @entity12 ‘ sometimes you probably think , “ i can do without it ” and other times it gives you so much pleasure			1
after the game on saturday ( the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity106 ) you ’d do without it , but you learn more from defeats and not doing so well , just like when you ’re a player			0
‘ but i ’ve enjoyed it			0
i ’ve enjoyed the whole experience and it ’s definitely helped me prepare for what will come after my playing career			0
‘ it ’s not a lot different from a player really , the satisfaction you get from winning and the pleasure you get from setting a team up and they go out and do their stuff			0
‘ when you lose a game you ’re gutted , angry and disappointed			0
but then , just like a player , you ca n’t wait for the next game to come so you can do something about it			0
‘ it goes in waves where one minute you ’re enjoying it one minute you ’re not but ultimately it gives you a lot of satisfaction when it goes right			0
’ farewell ? @entity0 may well have played his last game for @entity1 having given senior debuts to @entity133 and @entity134 against @entity12 in midweek , @entity0 has supported plans for a new division for @entity21 ‘ b ’ teams to give young @entity139 players more opportunities			1
‘ i would support it , ’ he said			0
‘ only speaking from my experience , i remember playing at @entity13 for the reserves when i was maybe 15 or 16 against @entity144 at two o’clock on a saturday afternoon			1
i was playing against men and it helped me			0
physically and mentally it brought me on			0
‘ that experience that young players will get rather than playing against players of their own age prepares you for what is the fastest quickest , strongest league in the world			0
i can only speak from my own experience and it definitely helped me			0
’ @entity157 of class : @entity41 is expected to be announced as @entity1 's new manager next week			0
