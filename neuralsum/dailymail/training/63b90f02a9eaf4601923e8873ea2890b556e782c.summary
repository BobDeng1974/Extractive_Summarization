by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is aiming to arrive in @entity3 on wednesday well rested and well read			1
the @entity6 fly - half ’s flight plan included further exploration of the power of instinctive thought			1
the book in his carry - on bag for the long - haul journey is another minor element of the 26 - year - old ’s career revival strategy — fine - tuned with the help of @entity19 ’s long - term mentor , @entity18			1
so , as the first contingent of @entity22 ’s squad hurtled across the time zones to @entity24 , @entity2 intended to peruse more words of wisdom			1
‘ i ’m about a third of the way through a book called @entity31 , by @entity32 , ’ he said , after explaining a recent reading habit			1
‘ it ’s about going with your instinctive decisions rather than taking the time to think and then trying to adjust , because about 90 per cent of the time our instincts are correct			2
you can take things out of it and apply it to rugby in terms of how you want to play , your decision - making , things like that			2
it keeps your mind occupied and working			0
’ back in the picture : @entity2 flew out to @entity24 with the @entity22 squad on tuesday made his point : @entity2 issues orders during @entity22 training at the @entity52 earlier this month black sets @entity2 various tasks , such as keeping a daily journal and reading books , then discussing the contents			1
the intention is to occupy his mind and make him think — in this case , ironically , think about not thinking too much			0
both mentor and pupil will recognise the fact that the gifted @entity64 has not always been well served by his instincts but they have been more reliable for the past year and more			2
@entity2 has spoken of how a drunken night out in @entity67 last april served as a tipping point			1
the shock of being rushed to hospital after being hit by a bus convinced him finally to make the most of a talent which had been in danger of going to waste			0
the decision to seek assistance from black last summer was the first step towards a profound transformation			0
the upshot has been a season of consistent form at his improving club and enough evidence of enhanced commitment and defensive resilience that an international recall which had seemed a distant prospect has now come to pass			0
‘ i knew i had to make some changes , to get my head down and do it the rugby way , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ that came probably in april last year			0
i started to work with @entity18 and i made the conscious decision that i wanted to put my head down and really go for it			0
‘ i ’ve had quite an enjoyable 12 - 15 months since then and it was always the dream , always the goal to get back in the @entity22 squad			1
fortunately enough , i have the chance to go to @entity24 and hopefully i ’ll represent my country again			0
’ this is a player with a high profile who attracts strident preconceptions and polarises opinion			0
but there is a sense that the penny has dropped			0
@entity107 has seized @entity2 and pointed him towards the virtues of selfless hard graft and modest professionalism			1
having played his way back into the @entity22 squad , he is hell - bent on showing team - mates , coaches and the public his altered nature and determination to make best use of his ability			1
hitting form : @entity2 has impressed for sale in the @entity120 during the last 12 months bon voyage : @entity2 ( left ) posted a picture alongside @entity123 on the flight to @entity24 asked if he relished this chance to change perceptions , he said : ‘ definitely , especially off the field			1
i want to give the best example of myself that i can over the next month and show them that i want to be an @entity22 rugby player more than anything			2
’ @entity22 in the @entity134 era have a revived streak of humility at their core			1
there are those who would question how a player often regarded as brash and self - centred could fit into a set - up where the emphasis is so emphatically on national pride and the common cause			2
yet , @entity2 rejects the notion that he must change to gain acceptance			2
‘ i feel like that has always been me , ’ he said			0
‘ to come into this environment , i ’ve got so much learning and catching up to do , i ’ve not really got time to focus on anything else			0
i know i ’m not first - choice here so humility has to come with that immediately			2
but i know where i want to be			0
’ @entity156 : @entity2 has not played for @entity22 since @entity157 was manager in 2008 lifeline : @entity134 is the first @entity22 coach to pick @entity2 in almost six years where he wants to be is in the @entity161 10 shirt — not just as a temporary stand - in , but when @entity163 has everyone available , unlike in @entity3 next weekend when @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 will all be out of contention			1
even without those more established rivals to usurp , @entity2 is destined to play second fiddle to @entity171			2
he will have to fight tooth and nail for a chance to add to the tally of seven caps he won in 2008 , but he has the hunger to do so and knows that the satisfaction will be all the greater if he makes it			0
‘ you do n’t want it to be an easy ride , ’ he said			0
‘ when it is tough , you have to keep working at it and there are obstacles to overcome , that ’s when you feel like you have achieved something			0
’ to reach this point has been an achievement in itself			0
for so long , it felt as if @entity2 ’s face did n’t fit ; that he was a maverick who could n’t be trusted			1
clearing that hurdle has been the hardest part			0
now he is in the @entity22 system again , his chance will surely come to prove that his instincts are suitably reliable these days			1
explosive impact : @entity2 looked to be a world - class star in the making during his early days with @entity22 shunned the celebrity lifestyle : @entity2 is now more associated with playing a starring role for @entity205 ( right ) than being pictured with glamorous women , such as former girlfriend @entity207 ( left )			1
