from their hairy bodies to their rippling legs , spiders can strike terror into even the the most seasoned nature lover			0
now a new video showing a giant parasitic worm bursting from the body of a huge @entity9 arachnid may push arachnophobes over the edge			1
the disgusting spectacle was filmed by @entity15 member @entity13 in @entity9 , who was shocked to see the writhing worm after spraying the spider with insecticide			1
it was filmed by @entity15 member @entity13 in @entity9 his video seems to show a giant parasitic nematode , or roundworm , erupting from the dead spider ’s body in a spiral shape , before unfurling to look like a strand of wriggling wholemeal spaghetti			1
it appears to be over 15 times longer than the spider ’s body and around the same size as the arachnid ’s abdomen			1
once the parasite is wriggling in a foamy sea of insecticide , the disgusted cameraman blasts it with more poison , as the video cuts out			2
@entity13 writes on his @entity15 page : ‘ ok so i was just editing my latest montage and this huge spider came out , so i sprayed it and killed it , then this f * * * * * n alien worm came out of it ! ’ comments include : ' just what in the sweet , holy , blessed reaches of sacred heaven is this ? ? ? ! ! ' and ' kill it with fire '			1
there is some conjecture as to exactly what the parasite is			2
the video seems to show a giant parasitic nematode worm erupting from the dead spider ’s body in a spiral shape , before unfurling to look like a strange of wriggling wholemeal spaghetti			1
an expert from @entity71 told @entity72 that it is a a @entity74 nematode worm , which infects arthropods , such as spiders a @entity74 nematode worm is a parasite of arthropods			1
@entity79 is an old family of nematode worms that live in arthropods such as crabs and spiders			2
a specimen is even preserved in a 40 million - year - old piece of amber			2
they are wire - like and smooth , with a tubular digestive tract with openings at each end			0
their larvae is eaten by an unfortunate arthropod and the parasite drinks its body fluids and east its digestive glands and muscles to grow			2
the host becomes less mobile but stays alive because its vital organs are not eaten			0
the ' zombie ' worm may take control of its host 's nervous system to guide to towards somewhere with water , to ensure the aquatic parasite 's survival			1
it bursts through its host 's body , eventually killing it			1
@entity113 , @entity114 at @entity71 told @entity72 : ‘ this is a @entity74 nematode worm , a parasite of arthropods			1
‘ the worm would have emerged at some point soon anyway but was obviously annoyed by the spraying of the spider			2
‘ the size of the worm is shockingly large in proportion to the body size of the host			1
’ the worm has also been identified as a hairworm , which looks similar to the untrained eye and can also infects spiders			0

the worms are wire - like and smooth , with a tubular digestive tract with openings at each end			0
the unfortunate spider likely ate its larvae , which then feasted on its host ’s body fluids , digestive glands , sexual organs and muscles to grow into a sizeable worm , @entity142 reported			1
the spider would have become less mobile but because its vital organs were not eaten , probably remained alive , despite the parasite filling its abdomen and cephalothorax ( mid-section )			2
even without the insecticide , the spider would likely have met a grisly end , because the @entity74 nematode worm would have burst out of the creature ’s body , killing it			1
the parasite ( pictured ) appears to be over 15 times longer than the spider ’s body and around the same size as the arachnid ’s abdomen			1
@entity79 is an old family of nematode worms that live in arthropods such as crabs and spiders - a specimen is even preserved in a 40 million - year - old piece of amber ingeniously , the aquatic parasite may also have taken control of its host ’s nervous system , causing the probably thirsty spider to seek out water and possibly drown in it , so that the parasite could continue to survive in liquid			1
the video may prove even more unpalatable for some , because humans can be infected with thousands of tiny nematodes too			0
dr @entity190 , an entomologist at @entity191 , told @entity192 : ‘ most have no obvious effect on us , and we are mostly unaware of their presence , but a few are large enough to cause diseases such as trichinosis			0
’ there are plenty of examples of zombiism in the animal kingdom			0
a fungus called @entity206 takes over the minds of insects			0
it starts life as a spore that lands on an ant , which slowly stops performing its usual role in a colony , so it ’s thrown out by more diligent worker ants			0
the fungus takes control of the ganglion cells that make up the insect ’s brain , forcing it to bite down hard on a leaf with its mandibles			1
at this point , @entity206 kills its host , causing a stalk to erupt through the ant ’s head and release more zombie spores to secure the fungus ’ grisly existence			0
@entity231 can be seen in the natural world : a fungus called @entity206 takes over the minds of insects			0
it controls the mind of its host ant , before killing it and releasing spores through its body ( pictured ) similarly , a tiny thorny - headed worm of the phylum @entity244 , burrows into the brain of a tiny crustacean , @entity246 , to take control of its nervous system			1
it forces the crab to swim towards the ocean ’s surface where it will be attacked by predators			0
in humans , tapeworms can make its way into the brain to change our behaviour , but a microbe called @entity261 ( @entity262 ) goes a step further			0
found in cat faeces , it can infect humans and stop them fearing risky behaviour , with tragic results			0
people can get roundworm , for example from swallowing microscopic eggs in food and water , or by touching contaminated soil			0
while it can be treated with medication – and some 80 cases are reported in the @entity279 every year – symptoms include a persistent dry cough and fever .			0

terrifying *footage* was filmed by @entity15 member @entity13 in @entity9
writhing spaghetti - like worm unfurls from the dead arachnid 's body
it appears to be over 15 times the length of the spider 's abdomen
expert from @entity71 told @entity72 the parasite is a @entity74 nematode worm , which lives inside arthropods
parasite eats muscle and takes control of a creature 's nervous system
it finally bursts forth , killing its host , as seen in this video
