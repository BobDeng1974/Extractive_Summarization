last month was the warmest august globally since records began 130 years ago			1
data by @entity2 shows that august 2014 experienced global highs 0.70 ° c above the 1951 - 1980 temperature average			1
however , the difference is small compared with previous warm @entity6 , including that of 2011 , 2008 , 2006 and 2003			0
pictured is tow august 2014 compared to the long - term average global temperature in august , in degrees @entity11			1
the 0.68 shown at the top right - hand corner is an estimate for the global mean change the second warmest august was 0.69 ° @entity11 in 2011 followed by 0.68 ° c in 1998 and 0.66 ° @entity11 in 2006			2
while this year has been exceptionally warm , @entity2 has warned against reading too much into a single month ’s records			1
dr @entity16 , a @entity2 climatologist told @entity17 that a very hot august is just one part of the data that ‘ point [ s ] towards the long - term trends			2
’ scientists had predicted extreme weather events to surface earlier this year after it looked like an @entity26 event would develop in the @entity27			1
@entity26 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity33 in the central and eastern @entity27 becomes hotter than usual			1

scientists had predicted extreme weather events to surface earlier this year after it looked like an @entity26 event would develop in the @entity27 @entity26 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity33 in the central and eastern @entity27 becomes hotter than usual			1
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity48 ( around 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			2
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity27 and globally			0
strong @entity26 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			2
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity63 is the climatological counterpart to @entity26			0
this refers to periods when sea temperatures around the @entity33 are cooler than normal			2
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity48 ( around 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			2
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity27 and globally			0
@entity78 wrote in science blogs : ‘ we do n’t know how 2014 will rank as a year			0
if there is no @entity26 it will rank high			0
‘ if an @entity26 gets going soon enough to affect the year ’s average , 2014 may well be in the top few warmest years since global warming began			1
’ but warmer weather in some parts of the world could trigger a freeze elsewhere			0
in a separate study , researchers discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures , and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex			0
they found that as oceans heat up and melt the @entity98 ice , warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere			0
the polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the @entity105 last winter			0
last month was the warmest august globally since records began 130 years ago , according to recent data released by @entity2			1

august 2014 experienced global highs 0.70 ° c above the 1951 - 1980 average
@entity2 claims it was the hottest august since records began 130 years ago
if an @entity26 affect the year ’s average , it will make 2014 a *sweltering* year
