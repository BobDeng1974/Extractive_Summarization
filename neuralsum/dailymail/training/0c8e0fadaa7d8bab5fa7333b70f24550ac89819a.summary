@entity0 is a time for full - on glamour , but i ’m not a fan of plunging necklines which can look desperate on an older woman — unless you ’re @entity6			1
however , too much fabric says ‘ matronly ’ and boring			1
how wonderful then that many of this year ’s frocks come with a daring twist			0
demure and covered at the front , they swoop sexily — in some cases perilously — low at the back			1
they ’re marvellous fun at drinks parties : chat sweetly to the vicar while letting the chap behind know you ’re less buttoned up than he thought			2
so which of the sexiest backless dresses on the @entity23 left me feeling full of @entity0 sparkle ? @entity26 gold sequin full length dress , £ 350 , phase - eight.com i ’m becoming seriously addicted to @entity29			1
this beautiful dress is part of their ‘ collection ’ and , although it ’s expensive , you get what you pay for			2
there ’s loads of hand - finishing and the stunning sequins — muted enough to gleam elegantly rather than blind you — coupled with the elegant net , silky lining and gorgeous shape make me feel like a million - dollar mermaid			0
and — oh joy ! — the cleverly positioned back strap , fitted with a cunning loop , enables you to wear a normal bra			0
yesterday , i saw a bride emerging from @entity51 in this dress , and she looked stunning			0
5/5 @entity53 and fabulous coral maxi dress , £ 130 , @entity56 ; earrings , £ 278 , @entity58 i leapt at this hour - glass shaped dress as soon as i saw it on the hanger : it ’s such a gorgeous , mood - lifting colour , and not one i ’d usually think of wearing			1
it ’s very well priced , easy to wear and the stretchy lace is not only firm enough to keep me comfortable without a bra , it ’s also very forgiving to any droopy bits			0
it fastens with a pretty diamante clasp , too			0
5/5 no room for a bra @entity72 dress , £ 65 , @entity73 ; shoes , £ 195 , @entity75 ; earrings , £ 95 , @entity77 this was the hardest for me to wear : it looks good from a certain distance but it ’s so tight and clingy that it would be best on someone younger			0
it ’s very sexy and fantastic value for a designer lookalike , but you need to avoid it if you ’ve any spare flesh			0
brilliant for @entity0 parties in a red , but make sure you ’re chauffeured around — there ’s no running for a bus or taxi in the tight skirt			1
and there ’s absolutely no room for a bra — i went for a clever trick from my theatre days , a skin - to - fabric glue called ‘ it stays ’			2
3/5 what a little gem @entity106 jewel strap full - length dress , £ 45 , @entity107 ; earrings , £ 15 , @entity109 - @entity110 excellent all round this one , and an amazing price			1
it ’s extremely comfortable and the high , elasticised empire - line waist supported me just enough to make a bra unnecessary			0
the very pretty neckline is jazzed up with shiny ‘ jewels ’ and i love the cute little tie at the back , which makes it feel very secure — and sexy			0
4/5 @entity122 teal full - length dress , £ 69.99 , @entity124 ; necklace , £ 45 , @entity109 - @entity110 another very good price but the material feels rather stiff — there ’s not much give in it so it needs to fit well and you would n’t want to overindulge on the cheese straws in this one			1
it ’s tricky bra-wise as the sides are cut away at the back in a heart shape , so it needs the cups - only sticky - on type , but the shape is very flattering			2
3/5 @entity142 - but beware of @entity143 long - sleeved full - length dress , £ 75 , @entity145 ; sandals , £ 175 , @entity147 ; belt , £ 60 , and earrings , £ 18 , @entity150 very good value for a glamorous red dress but the material is a bit thin and so clingy that you have to wear knickers without a @entity143 , or be brave and wear none at all ! the good thing here is that the v at the back is n’t too wide , so you can get away with a sticky - winged bra with this — and the long sleeves are great if you worry about exposed arms			1

@entity0 is a time for full - on glamour
but plunging necklines do *n't* suit women of all ages
too much fabric can look manly and boring
a sexily low swoop at the back of the dress is *perfect* for parties
