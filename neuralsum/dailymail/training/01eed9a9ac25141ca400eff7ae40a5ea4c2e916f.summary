last month the world was stunned as @entity3 's @entity2 rocket experienced a fault shortly after launching , falling back to @entity5 in an enormous fiery explosion			1
now new footage has been released from up close that shows the demise of the rocket like never before			2
remotely operated cameras recently recovered from the launch pad captured the explosion in incredible detail - and one even reveals footage from inside the resultant cloud of dust and debris			1
an @entity2 rocket failed and exploded seconds after launching from @entity26 on 28 october			1
officials later explained that they detonated the rocket after a fault was spotted the footage was compiled by websites @entity31 and @entity33			1
they explain that , as their cameras were so close to the launchpad , they had not been hopeful of retrieving much , if any , of the data			2
and they were also restricted from retrieving their data after lift - off owing to the obviously hazardous conditions			0
the @entity2 rocket was due to launch an unmanned @entity47 @entity46 spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the @entity50			1
this included science experiments , experiment hardware , spare parts , and crew provisions - as part of a £ 1.2 billion ( $ 1.9billion ) deal with @entity3			0
outfitted with a new , more powerful upper - stage engine , the @entity2 rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds ( 2,293 kg ) of supplies , science experiments and equipment , a 15 percent increase over previous missions			1
' the initial liftoff looked flawless			0
then , suddenly , the exhaust turned bright yellow and became far brighter than usual			0
' that 's when we knew things were about to get bad , ' said @entity69 , a launch photojournalist for @entity31 and @entity71			0
' the vehicle seemed to hang in the air and started to burn , it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion			0
' it fell in a pillar of fire and exploded on impact , and we could feel the heat on our face from 1.5 miles [ 2.4km ] away			0
seconds later the shockwave hit , and we all ran for the buses to evacuate			0
we had little hope of any cameras surviving			0
' but amazingly four cameras from journalists working for the two websites did survive , ' and the footage is nothing short of spectacular ' said @entity92			2
the @entity3 - funded rocket exploded ( previous image shown ) on its way to the @entity50 just six seconds after lift - off from the @entity97 on @entity98 in @entity21			1
the rocket exploded at 6:22pm edt on 28 october , and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion ( previous image shown )			1
@entity107 said it would ' likely ' stop using the type of @entity110 engines that were employed when its unmanned @entity2 commercial supply rocket exploded they explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras , but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the @entity119			1
one of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion			2
as dust and debris flies around , the camera somehow manages to survive			2
the @entity3 - funded rocket exploded on its way to the @entity50 just six seconds after lift - off from the @entity97 on @entity98 in @entity21			1
the rocket exploded at 6:22pm edt on 28 october , and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of @entity5 - observation satellites			1
organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion			0
@entity107 said it would ' likely ' stop using the type of old @entity110 engines that were employed when its unmanned @entity2 commercial supply rocket bound for the @entity50 exploded moments after liftoff last week			1
the company said its investigation of the crash is continuing , but preliminary results point to a failure in one of its two main engines involved in the first stage of launch			2
' as a result , the use of these engines for the @entity2 vehicle likely will be discontinued , ' it said			0
but the company still plans to fulfill its contract with @entity3 to fulfill all its remaining cargo missions to the @entity50 by the end of 2016 .			0

cameras recovered from launch pad in @entity21 shed new light on disaster
@entity2 rocket failed and exploded seconds after launching from @entity26 on 28 october
officials later explained that they detonated the rocket after fault spotted
new footage shows the launch up close and one camera was even inside the resultant cloud of dust and debris
at the time the failure was blamed on a @entity110 engine so rocket operator @entity107 will use a new engine for *future* *flights*
