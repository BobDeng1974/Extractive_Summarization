by @entity1 reporter published : 12:14 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 29 may 2013 a set of 26 - year - old twins have stunned doctors by both suffering strokes just months apart from each other			1
@entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , @entity9 , felt a sharp pain on the back of her head as she got into bed last july - just nine months before her non-identical twin , @entity14 , felt the same pain			1
both women also suffered a loss of vision and numbness down their body , but for @entity7 , the pain occurred on the right side , while for @entity14 , it occurred on the left			1
medical staff said that for both of the women - who are fraternal twins - to suffer a stroke at such a young age is ' like lightning striking twice ' , especially as they had no family history of the condition			1
alike : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity32 , 26 , suffered strokes nine months apart from each other it is a common misconception only the elderly suffer strokes ; in fact , one third of sufferers are under 65 and people younger than 45 , the stroke risk has jumped 14 to 20 per cent , experts said			1
while @entity7 and @entity14 are both active women , they increased their risk by smoking and taking the contraceptive pill			1
they had both previously suffered migraines and @entity7 also had a small , previously undetected hole in her heart			1
despite the prevalence of strokes among young people , doctors did not at first diagnose @entity7 correctly , @entity50 reported			1
when she suffered the pain in her head , loss of vision and numbness , her brother rushed her to hospital , where doctors believed she was just suffering a migraine and sent her home			0
' i was absolutely terrified , ' she told @entity50			0
' i slept for three days straight			0
then , when i woke up , my vision was horrible			0
everything was distorted and one - dimensional			0
i could barely get around			0
' treatment : they received treatment at the @entity71 in @entity72 , pictured , and have undergone therapy			0
they still sufferer with vision issues but are otherwise back to full health stroke is a leading cause of death in the @entity80 , claiming the lives of nearly 130,000 @entity80 each year , according to the @entity82			2
about one - third of strokes are believed to occur in people younger than 65 , and for people younger than 45 , the stroke risk has jumped 14 to 20 percent , according to dr. @entity87 , a vascular neurologist at @entity71			1
it means that about about one in five victims is now below the age of 55			0
symptoms include sudden numbness or weakness in the face , arm or leg , sudden confusion , sudden vision loss and dizziness , and sudden severe headache			0
risk is increased by alcohol and drug consumption and by smoking			2
experts also believe the increasing number of young sufferers is due to the rise in diabetes , obesity and high cholesterol			1
eating a balanced diet , exercising regularly and getting blood pressure checks can help reduce the chance of suffering a stroke			0
she was sent to an urgent care facility , where she learned she had had a stroke			0
@entity32 left school in @entity119 to take care of @entity7 - but nine months later , their roles reversed			1
after running in a 5k race , @entity32 returned home feeling thirsty and tired			2
but when she awoke , she felt a sharp pain at the back of her head and was suffering poor vision and jumbled thoughts			0
yet because of her sister 's experience , she knew she was having a stroke - although medical staff initially disagreed			1
' the @entity133 told me that the chance of both me and my sister having a stroke this young was that of being struck by lightning twice , ' she said			2
dr. @entity87 , a vascular neurologist at @entity71 in @entity72 , told @entity50 that it was indeed very rare for the two sisters , who do not share dna , to suffer strokes at a young age			2
' honestly , it 's rare for us to actually evaluate two sisters who 've had strokes within months of each other , ' she said			2
' if they had a family history , it would not be a surprise			1
' she added that most of the cases among young people are spontaneous , and can be brought on my obesity and the diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol that is associated with it			1
the twins said they have both stopped smoking and taking the pill			2
they have undergone occupational and speech therapy , but their vision is still affected and they can not drive			0
' we think we are invincible until we are not , ' @entity32 said			0
' this taught us a huge lesson that we are not guaranteed great health and we need to take care of our bodies			0

@entity7 suffered a stroke in august last year - nine months before her twin @entity32 did
their risks were increased by smoking , the pill and history of migraines
but medical staff said it is ' like lightning striking twice ' as the women are not identical twins and do not have a family history of strokes
strokes among young people on the rise due to *unhealthier* *lifestyles*
