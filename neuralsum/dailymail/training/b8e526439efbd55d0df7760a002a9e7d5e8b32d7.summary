@entity1 in the jungle was a sad , sorry sight			1
in some ways it epitomised what ’s wrong with @entity7 football – too many who have the privilege of being involved in our beautiful game see it as one big joke			2
@entity1 became the first contestant to be voted off the @entity15 show on monday after topping the public vote			1
@entity18 @entity1 blames editing for making him look like a bully @entity1 was booted out of the jungle on monday after topping the public vote @entity1 gave fellow contestant @entity23 some stick during the show do n’t get me wrong , apart from the unnecessary and annoying shouting , @entity1 seemed to enjoy being @entity30 , and the bullying of non-league footballer - turned - x - factor - reject @entity23 ( which was passed off as ‘ banter ’ , the standard fallback excuse used by those who enjoy putting others down in a sad attempt to make themselves look good ) , the former @entity27 midfielder was one of the entertainers in this current series of @entity41			1
but he was wasted in there			2
watching @entity1 lose his nerve in a tomb of rats and literally running away because he was so scared , you might be forgiven for thinking he is n’t the kind of guy you ’d want next to you in the trenches			1
@entity1 grimaces during the @entity50 ' you might be right in those circumstances , with hunger and darkness overwhelming him , and home thousands of miles away ( although @entity55 managed to see it through )			1
but in football terms , @entity1 was brave			1
i ’ll give you two examples from early in his career			2
firstly back in 2002 , i commentated on an @entity62 tie at @entity63 in which @entity1 was playing for @entity64			1
( ironically , in his excellent autobiography published recently , @entity65 described moving to @entity64 as like ‘ emigrating to @entity67 ’ )			2
this @entity62 tie at @entity63 was crucial – the winner would face @entity70 – led by sir @entity71 and @entity72 - at home in the fourth round			0
a massive money - spinner for either @entity63 or @entity64			0
bullard in action for @entity64 against @entity77 back in 2003 the home side went 2 - 0 in front and even missed a twice - taken penalty			0
@entity64 pulled one back , and then won a penalty			0
the previous week @entity1 had missed not one but two spot - kicks against @entity83			1
the first was saved by the keeper low to his left , the second saved low to his right			0
despite his @entity83 fail the week before , @entity1 was desperate to take it , so he grabbed the ball and hit the net			1
@entity64 won the replay and earned a small fortune from the @entity70 tie			0
that ’s bottle from @entity1			1
the second example came later that same season , shortly before @entity1 earned a move to @entity98 on his way to the @entity100			1
i was in the away end as @entity64 travelled to @entity103			0
@entity1 's sparkling form for @entity105 earned him a call - up to the @entity108 squad in 2008 @entity64 were shocking , truly terrible , and were comfortably beaten , the 2 - 1 scoreline at the end flattered @entity64			1
but @entity1 stood out head and shoulders above everybody else on the pitch			1
despite being 2 - 0 behind , he wanted the ball all the time			0
he wanted to take responsibility ; he wanted to make things happen			0
he was the one running back to the keeper to receive the ball and start something off , trying to get his team into the game			0
in football terms , that ’s brave – when your team is terrible , you ’re being soundly beaten , none of your team - mates are on your level , yet you do n’t hide , you do n’t belt it long up the field as far away as possible			0
the midfielder 's career was hampered by some serious injury problems no , instead , @entity1 wanted to have the ball at his feet and be a footballer			1
despite defeat that night at @entity142 , i came away from that game full of respect for @entity1			2
it ’s interesting that in his book @entity1 seems to crave the acceptance of fans for his comedy antics rather than his ability			2
staring at @entity151 , mocking @entity152 , diving over a load of team - mates in a penalty area			0
as @entity1 wrote : ‘ it ’s always about the stuff that i did around football , rather than the football itself			2
’ the last time @entity1 and i spoke before he went off to @entity67 was when he came in to do some work at @entity164			2
@entity1 finished his playing days at @entity165 outfit @entity166 in 2012 he accused me of ‘ leaving one on him ’			1
roughly translated this means he was upset that i had suggested that him and @entity170 singing the @entity172 song to @entity174 ’s face during an @entity108 training session was n’t a wise course of action			0
the right attitude at an international training camp ? no , of course not			0
and i think most people who care about football would feel the same , and would therefore ‘ leave one on him ’			0
nothing wrong with joking around , but sometimes you need to rein it in			0
@entity1 is good company and a great laugh			2
but i ca n’t help thinking football is missing out without him			0
it should not have been @entity41 for @entity1 , it should be : ‘ i was a naturally talented footballer , get me out of here so i can pass on my knowledge to young players ’ .			1
