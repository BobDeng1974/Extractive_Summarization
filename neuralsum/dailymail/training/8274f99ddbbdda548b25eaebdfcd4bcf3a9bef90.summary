by @entity0 picture a group of monkeys and you might imagine them swinging from trees , gathering bananas or perhaps squabbling over scraps of food			2
but from toasting marshmallows on a camp fire to writing with paper and pen and flossing their teeth , these primates have found better ways to pass the time			1
and here they are practising their remarkably human - like skills in a series of images that have never been seen before			1
it shows just how like us some primates really are there ’s @entity38 the @entity40 - based bonobo , who orders picnics on a smartphone , using technology that would baffle even some humans			2
he can also cook fry - ups on fires he has built , lighting piles of broken tree branches with a match			1
and to satisfy a sweet tooth , the dexterous primate toasts even uses his homemade fire to toast marshmallows he has skewered on a twig			1
then there ’s the orang - utan who has taught himself how to write , gripping a pen in the fist of his hand			2
and resourceful long - tailed macaques in @entity23 use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth			1
tonight the monkeys will be seen in the first episode of a three - part documentary on @entity27 called @entity28			1
it will see zoologist and presenter dr @entity69 travel the globe to seek out the most interesting primates in the wild			0
unlike some other species , many of them live in close knit communities , where they encounter situations that may be familiar to some humans			0
take the hierarchical system for hamadryas baboons in @entity82 , for example , where the dictatorial males dictate over their packs			0
and in @entity87 , male emperor tamarins are conned into childcare			0
griller in the mist : @entity38 builds a fire from dry twigs and skilfully strikes a match to light it @entity93 : his hands look almost human as he deftly skewers a marshmallow on a branch much of their activities are governed by need – such as an elaborate alarm system @entity102 vervet monkeys use to warn of predators			1
while thieving rhesus macaques in @entity105 stage lookouts as their peers raid properties for food			2
but just like us humans , there ’s room for fun in their lives as well , as proven by the primates cannon balling into a pool of water			0
and enjoying what appears to be the equivalent of a spa day , their cousins in @entity121 spend their days languishing in hot springs , while delighted tourists take their photographs			2
dr @entity69 , who has appeared in several other @entity27 documentaries including @entity130 and @entity131 , spent a year visiting primates to learn about how they behave			1
those with the largest brains , such as apes and orang - utans , he said , were the most equipped to copy human traits , and could be taught how to do things like writing			1
that smells good : @entity38 stays a safe distance from the flames as he toasts the sweet those with the largest brains , such as apes and orangutans were the most equipped to copy human traits , and could be taught to do things such as fishing but smaller primates , like macaques , will adapt their behaviour because of the environment they are in			1
dr @entity69 said : ‘ you can have the same species in two different places and their behaviour will be different			0
with the macaques in @entity23 for example , one of them will have realised they could use a strand of human hair to get annoying bits of food out of their teeth and the others will have copied			1
in another part of @entity23 , where there are fewer tourists , they wo n’t do the same			1
’ what most of it comes down to however , dr @entity69 said , is a desire for food			0
and it is why the @entity105 macaques , living in rural areas , have evolved to scale buildings because they know it comes from inside			2
dr @entity69 said : ‘ animals like this adapt to their habitat very , very easily			0
so as opposed to having a jungle vine you ’ve got power lines and it ’s actually the same			0
you basically swing through those and instead of food being hidden as a prize in the trees it ’s inside the buildings			0
they just have to work out how to get hold of it			0
that ’s evidence of how their brains work			0
