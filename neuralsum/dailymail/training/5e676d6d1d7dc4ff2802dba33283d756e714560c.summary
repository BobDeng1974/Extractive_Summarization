@entity0 is celebrating 20 years at @entity1 - and tells how her heartbreak at being separated from her family while on the road led to her joining the show			1
the mother of three freely admits she put her backpack to rest after filming one particularly gut - wrenching news story			1
the two - time emmy winner , 56 , says : ' i had extra pages in my passport because i was travelling so much			1
i was in @entity13 and my little boy called me crying ' mommy , please come home '			0
' we were on a story about a woman who kidnapped back her son in violation of an agreement with her ex husband in @entity25 , ' she says : ' we were with these former @entity27 commandos , all very @entity28 , whom she had hired after exhausting every resource , spending her last dollar and selling her furniture to finance these efforts			2
she said : ' when they put the key in the motor to crank up the boat , it did n't start , they had come in on fumes			0
' and that really hit me , because here i am , 5,000 miles away from my own child and this woman has given up everything to be reunited with hers			0
happily married to husband @entity60 since 1987 , @entity0 added : ' for me , this was an epiphany , as a journalist that was a really cool story and it hit on a number of levels , but for me personally , as a mom , a woman and a wife , it was like ' what are you doing this for ? when are you going to grow up ? ' this is great , you 're going to cool places , you 're doing nifty stuff , but you have a husband and a son and you may have a two or a four - year - deal with @entity82 news , but you have a lifetime contract with these people , and that 's when i called my agent and said ' when my deal is up i need something where i am an anchor , by anchor , i mean glued , rooted to a show			1
' @entity82 was offering me the evening weekend anchor job , but i would have still been on the road during the week , so that 's when i thanked them and went to @entity1			1
' the willowy blonde , who was one of @entity96 ' best friends ' , started on @entity1 , succeeding @entity97 , on march 5 , 1995			1
@entity1 remains a steady ship in the network sea , averaging 4.7 million viewers last november , second only to @entity101			2
@entity0 revealed : ' i actually wrote into my contract you can not travel more than a certain number of days , but i 've never come close to that as i 'm stuck in the studio ! ' i thought ' if i 'm going to have a long career , i need to be successful for whoever i work for , but also successful as a person '			1
' friends in high places : @entity0 with former secretary of state @entity112 beloved pal : @entity0 , her husband @entity60 and @entity96			2
@entity0 gave a eulogy at @entity96 's funeral following her death in september the young girl from @entity119 , @entity120 , had no expectations of a career where she would end up interviewing the @entity124 prime minister in front of the nation			2
but from winning @entity128 to shining as the only journalist to interview president @entity130 when he returned to his home @entity120 in 1979 when she still a college senior , it was clear that @entity0 was a natural			1
her star rose , and she joined the today show in september 1989 on the newsdesk and took over from @entity136 as co-anchor in october 1989			0
moments she cherishes include interviewing @entity124 prime minister @entity138 in october 1990 , just weeks after @entity139 had invaded @entity140			0
' how long will we have ? ' , the @entity142 asked , to which @entity0 replied : ' unfortunately , madame prime minister , this is live tv , so we 'll have four or five minutes if we 're lucky			2
' ' oh , so you 'd like my answers snappy ' , mrs @entity138 said , and as @entity0 recounts : ' she very snappily proceed to tell me that over dinner the night before , she and president @entity150 decided while it would be nice if there was a @entity155 resolution authorizing the invasion of @entity157 , it was n't necessary , and that @entity124 and the @entity158 were prepared to go in and defend @entity140			1
' as a reporter , you have moments when that bell goes off in your head , but the bell was going off around the world , on wire machines - yes , those still existed - that the @entity158 and @entity124 were prepared to unilaterally defend @entity140			0
' ' that ' , @entity0 says , a touch modestly , ' was cool			2
' but viewers quickly complained there no chemistry between @entity0 and co-host @entity173 , and soon after @entity0 went on maternity leave to have her first son @entity175 in february 1991 , it was announced she would not be returning , @entity176 taking her place instead			1
rebounding , @entity0 got her own radio show with @entity179 , which launched in september 1991 and then joined @entity82 news in 1993 , first on @entity181 then on @entity182			2
fascinating : for @entity1 in 2000 , @entity0 spent a week in prison in @entity184 hard - going : @entity0 said she met women with harrowing stories during her time in prison - including one teenager who had grown up with drug - addict parents and another whose teeth were rotted away due to crack one of @entity0 's most defining tv moments came when she was incarcerated for a week on @entity1 in february 2000			1
she laughed : ' the idea actually has its roots as one of the executives was a fan of the @entity198 show oz and so they went to the federal prison system and said ' we want to put @entity0 in jail ' and the @entity203 , to my everlasting gratitude , said ' no , we wo n't take her '			1
however , the execs then called every single department of corrections ' not even @entity206 would take me on ' , @entity0 says : ' i thought i was off the hook ! ' but they soon found a sheriff in @entity209 , @entity184 , who ran what he called ' the toughest jail in @entity158 '			2
@entity0 said : ' he said ' she do n't get out till i say she gets out ! '			1
they put me in there for a week and it was like cuckoo land			0
' there were six beds , at one point i think we were up to 18 in there			0
it was a real window on what @entity158 jails were like			0
junior miss ! with a talent for sewing , @entity0 's road to success started when she entered the @entity231 ( @entity120 ) junior miss pageant in 1975 - and won live on tv ! @entity0 's passion for tv was sparked by her appearance during the live @entity128 finals - and the cameraman lying at her feet ! budding reporter : @entity0 as a young journalist ' one woman was in there for attempted murder			1
the story , to hear her tell it , was that her boyfriend spontaneously combusted			0
the prosecution seemed to feel that gasoline and a match were somehow involved			0
' a teenager , who had grown up in a house with crack - addict parents who had once sold her bedroom furniture for drugs , was in armed robbery with intent to kill to fund her own drug addiction			0
she thought that @entity258 was not a drug			0
@entity0 said : ' there was another woman , she pulled her mouth back and she showed me where her molars should have been , but the dental material was all gone and nothing was left by the fillings which is what crack will do , it 's same as meth mouth			1
i 'm pretty sure she lost brain material as well			0
' admitting it was a ' high impact stunt ' , @entity0 said : ' i 'll be damned if i 'll let them make me a pawn in a stunt			2
i wanted there to be some journalism there , and in fact at that point , when they put me in jail , the jail population in @entity158 was rising at a rate of nine per cent a year , that 's staggering			0
' and i was able to show there 's nothing happening in jail that 's going to prevent any of these people from doing any of the activities that got them there in the first place			0
' as for the future , @entity0 said : ' i love what i do , we do great work at @entity1 - and here 's to another 20 years ! ' today anchor : @entity0 rose to the ranks of the @entity301 co-anchor , seen here with fellow co-anchor @entity173			1
she left the @entity304 show in 1991 soon after the birth of her first son			0

@entity0 , 56 , has been on @entity1 since march 5 , 1995 , taking over from @entity308
she left her job as an on - the - road journalist after reporting the story of a mom who *rescued* her son from her ex-husband
she says of @entity1 : ' we do good work , i ca n't believe i 've been here for 20 years ! '
