a new book that paints an unprecedented picture of female sexuality and contains explosive theories regarding sexuality and desire may strike fear in the heart of every heterosexual male			1
journalist @entity10 's book ' @entity11 : adventures in the @entity13 ' uses groundbreaking research to reveal that even in our enlightened and permissive culture , female sexuality and desire is completely misunderstood - by both men and women			1
the book explains that research into the area of female desire and sexuality has been shaped by gender stereotypes and how cultural ideals of female sexuality have repressed and even reshaped women 's desires and their sex lives			1
@entity10 , right , drew on research and interviews with behavioral scientists , psychologists , sexologists and everyday women to write an insightful new book that challenges ideas about female sexuality and desire ' @entity11 ' , which began life as an article in the @entity41 in 2009 , claims that despite much evidence suggesting female sexuality is every bit as strong and desire - driven as male sexuality , if not more so , research into female sexuality in both the animal and human realms has been blind to evidence of female lust and and unreserved sexual behavior			1
in fact , @entity10 found that female sexuality is everything we tell ourselves about male sexuality - that it 's base , ravenous and animalistic - is true of female sexuality			1
certain qualities society has traditionally attributed to women - that they are inherently and biologically better suited to monogamy , that women 's desires are based in romantic love - are ' scarcely more than a fairy tale ' , writes @entity10			1
' women are supposed to be the standard ’s more natural allies , caretakers , defenders , ' @entity10 writes , ' their sexual beings more suited , biologically , to faithfulness			1
' @entity72 : @entity10 says female sexuality is not the rational , civilized and balancing force we 've long thought it to be @entity10 told @entity77 that he was struck by ' the distance between reality and the fable that we ’ve been taught most recently by evolutionary psychology , that is , that men are driven to spread their seed and women , by comparison , are more driven to find one good provider , and that , therefore ... women are much better suited to monogamy			1
' the idea of women being passive and men being the initiators of sexual contact is also a myth , both in the human and the animal worlds , says @entity10			1
he mentions the case of the rhesus monkey , @entity100 , who upon observation could be seen relentlessly stalking the object of her desire			0
deirdrah the rhesus monkey showed researcher @entity105 that primate sexuality is not dominated by males ' for decades , ' @entity10 told @entity77 , ' despite evidence to the contrary , scientists had painted primate sex as male dominated			2
males are the initiators ; females the sort of almost indifferent receivers , ' when evidence showed this clearly was n't the case			0
women 's sexual desires and fantasies are often submissive or passive , says @entity10 , and he believes ' the force of culture has , to some degree , inverted things ' in terms of how women think about themselves and sex			1
' the force of culture puts some level of shame on women ’s sexuality and a fantasy of sexual assault is a fantasy that allows for sex that is completely free of blame , ' @entity10 told @entity77			2
desire : @entity10 says the idea that women are biologically better suited to monogamy than men is a ' fairytale ' ' so that ’s one reason			1
another , which [ researcher , @entity147 ] @entity146 brings up , and which i think is very compelling , is this idea that the feeling of being desired is a very powerful one , a very electrical one			2
and i think at least at the fantasy level , that sense of being wanted , and being wanted beyond the man ’s self - control is also really powerful , ' he said , addressing the idea of submission fantasies			0
researchers have also found intriguing disparities between women 's minds and their bodies when it comes to sexuality			2
a study by @entity105 found that male and female subjects shown the same series of videos had markedly different physical and mental reactions			0
the videos consisted of a heterosexual couple having sex , male and female homosexual couples having sex , a woman masturbating , a man masturbating , a naked chiseled man walking along the beach and a naked toned woman doing calisthenics - and a male and female bonobo monkey mating			0
men who identified as straight were aroused mentally and physically by all the videos featuring women - bar the monkeys			0
' gay males were aroused in the opposite categorical pattern			0
any expectation that the animal sex would speak to something primitive within the men seemed to be mistaken ; neither straights nor gays were stirred by the bonobos , ' @entity10 wrote in the @entity41 in 2009			2
but the female subjects of the study were not so straight forward			0
while they reported arousal at only traditional couplings ' no matter what their self - proclaimed sexual orientation , [ women ] showed , on the whole , strong and swift genital arousal when the screen offered men with men , women with women and women with men			0
they responded objectively much more to the exercising woman than to the strolling man , and their blood flow rose quickly ... though to a lesser degree than during all the human scenes except the footage of the ambling , strapping man — as they watched the apes			0
' into film : @entity227 has conducted groundbreaking research into female sexuality , but may be best known for creating ' bonono porn ' @entity10 said that when the women reported their mental arousal , ' mind and genitals seemed scarcely to belong to the same person			1
' all this goes to prove , believes @entity105 , that when it comes to desire , women are as visually stimulated and more easily turned on than men			2
the idea that a woman needs to feel emotionally connected in order to feel attracted and aroused seems to be another story we tell ourselves about women			0
' being a human who is sexual , who is allowed to be sexual , is a freedom accorded by society much more readily to males than to females , ' @entity246 , professor of psychology at @entity247 tells @entity10 in the book			2
loved up : research has show that female primates are n't backwards about coming forwards with their sexual desires for their fellow monkeys @entity10 's book is likely to shine light on the range and power of female sexuality for both men and women , which could prove confronting for some			1
@entity10 says the idea that it 's not only men who struggle with long - term monogamy may cause men to start worrying less about themselves and more about how their partners feel about monogamy			1
' i just had two funny conversations , ' @entity10 told @entity77			0
' one with a male writer , a friend of mine , who said that reading the book had inspired deep concern , and another from an editor who said that it had scared the bejesus out of him			0
[ @entity285 ] i laugh , but i think that maybe it should , and i hope that it at least lets us look past the blinders that we ’ve had on			0
' ' @entity11 : adventures in the @entity13 ' ( @entity290 ) is out now and available in hardcover and digital editions .			0

new book draws on scientific research to prove that our ideas of female sexuality and desire are all wrong
author @entity10 says that female sexuality is every bit as powerful as men 's but that cultural ideals have caused it to be repressed and even reshaped
@entity10 says the idea that women are biologically better suited to monogamy than men is a ' fairytale '
