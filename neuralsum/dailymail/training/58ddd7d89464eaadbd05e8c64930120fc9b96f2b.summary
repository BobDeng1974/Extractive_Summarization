by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:28 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 29 may 2013 an amazing time - lapse video has squeezed the @entity5 's nine - month mission into just one minute of viewing			1
the incredible clip is the work of @entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , who claims that it 's his first time making such a video			1
downloading the raw images from the @entity5 website , @entity9 arranged the photos from the rover 's front left hazcam and into an mpeg format			1
he uploaded the video to @entity23 on may 22			2
start : the incredible time lapse video begins with just a faint shadow of the @entity5 in the early days of its mission in august 2012 surface : the terrain of the red planet is seen in one of the images taken by @entity5 built to amaze : the incredible clip is the work of @entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , who claims that it 's his first time making such a video mr @entity9 also includes a link that provides the code he used to make the clip on @entity40			1
his video has been making the rounds on social media , and even curiosity itself posted the @entity23 link on its official @entity47 account			0
since then , it has gotten about 227,000 hits on the video - sharing site			0
@entity5 landed on @entity51 on august 6 , 2012 , and has spent its time investigating and analyzing the landscape and geology of the red planet			1
leaving a mark : @entity5 's own tire tracks are seen in this image from the rover 's mission on @entity51 dig : an arm containing some of @entity5 's tools is seen on the surface of the planet internet sensation : the video has been making the rounds on social media , and even curiosity itself posted the @entity23 link on its official @entity47 account last week , the rover used a drill on its robotic arm to collect a powdered sample from the interior of a rock called ' @entity78			1
' the sample is now being examined in @entity5 's on - board laboratory			0
in march , data from @entity5 revealed that a rock located near the @entity83 landing site contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for microbial life , the over-arching goal of the planned two - year mission			0
scientists are eager for additional information about the rock sample , which was drilled out from what appears to be a slab of bedrock in an area known as @entity95			0
after back - to - back computer problems , the six - wheel curiosity rover , seen in this self - portrait , has resumed its science experiments an image captured by the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) on @entity103 's @entity51 rover @entity5 revealing interesting internal color in this rock which was broken by @entity5 when it drove over it they have identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed			2
the $ 2.5billion rover landed on @entity51 on aug. 6 to assess if the planet most like @entity119 has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life			2
scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a 3 - mile ( 5 - km ) high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of @entity83 .			0

time - lapse clip created by @entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , using images from the rover 's website
he uploaded video to @entity23 on may 22 , and it has nearly 227,000 views
@entity5 landed on @entity51 in august 2012 , and has been investigating the landscape of the red planet and analyzing rocks
