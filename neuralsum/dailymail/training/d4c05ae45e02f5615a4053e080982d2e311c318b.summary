@entity0 has downplayed emails that suggest the @entity2 knew an @entity4 militant group had claimed credit for the attack on the @entity8 consulate in @entity9 , @entity10 on september 11 just two hours after it took place			1
the dismissal comes after three internal emails sent by her @entity16 staff surfaced in which officials specifically mention that @entity10 group @entity20 had claimed responsibility			1
the secretary of state said that the group 's claims of responsibility on @entity26 and @entity27 were not ' evidence ' - and that they had also denied carrying out the attacks in the same time			1
' posting something on @entity26 is not in and of itself evidence , ' @entity30 said			1
' and i think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be			0
' scroll down to hear secretary @entity30 address the messages denial : @entity0 , pictured on tuesday , has dismissed claims the @entity2 knew that an @entity42 - linked group had claimed responsibility for the @entity8 consulate attacks in @entity10 @entity2 press secretary @entity45 added : ' i think within a few hours that organization itself claimed that it had not been responsible			1
neither should be taken as fact			0
' the emails were obtained by @entity51 from government sources not connected with @entity8 spy agencies or the @entity16 and who requested anonymity			1
three @entity58 senators wrote a letter to the @entity2 on wednesday saying the emails ' add to the confusion ' about what the administration knew of the attacks , @entity56 reported			1
' in television interviews nearly a week after the events in @entity9 , you yourself even refused to describe it as a terrorist attack , instead emphasizing the role played by a hateful video , ' @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 wrote			2
' this concerted misrepresentation of the facts of the case - facts that , it appears , you and your administration possessed almost as soon as the attack began - is why so many of our constituents are demanding a fuller explanation of why your administration responded as it did			2
' the emails in questions were sent on the afternoon of september 11 by the @entity16 's @entity88 to multiple government offices , including addresses at the @entity2 , @entity91 , intelligence community and @entity93			1
deadly : four @entity8 , including ambassador @entity94 , died in the attack on the @entity8 @entity96 in @entity9 the first email , timed at 4.05pm @entity98 time - or 10.05pm @entity9 time , 20 - 30 minutes after the attack on the @entity8 diplomatic mission allegedly began - carried the subject line ‘ @entity8 @entity104 in @entity105 ’ and the notation ‘ @entity103 , ’ meaning ‘ @entity103			1

’ official version : president @entity153 said during an interview on ' @entity155 ' that he did n't believe mob violence alone was responsible for the deadly assault on the embassy while some information identifying recipients of this message was redacted from copies of the messages obtained by @entity51 , a government source said that one of the addresses to which the message was sent was the @entity168 , the president 's secure command post			2
other addressees included intelligence and military units as well as one used by the @entity93 command center , the source said			2
it was not known what other messages were received by agencies in @entity98 from @entity10 that day about who might have been behind the attacks			2
intelligence experts caution that initial reports from the scene of any attack or disaster are often inaccurate			0
@entity8 ambassador @entity94 and three other @entity8 were killed in the @entity9 assault , which president @entity153 and other @entity8 officials ultimately acknowledged was a ‘ terrorist ’ attack carried out by militants with suspected links to @entity42 affiliates or sympathizers			1
administration spokesmen , including @entity2 spokesman @entity45 , citing an unclassified assessment prepared by the @entity198 , maintained for days that the attacks likely were a spontaneous protest against an @entity202 film			0
while officials did mention the possible involvement of ‘ extremists , ’ they did not lay blame on any specific militant groups or possible links to @entity42 or its affiliates until intelligence officials publicly alleged that on september 28			0
killed : ambassador @entity94 ( left ) died following smoke inhalation , while agent @entity213 ( right ) died in a desperate battle heroic : former @entity215 ( left ) and @entity216 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack on a building which has now been revealed to be a @entity198 base there were indications that extremists with possible @entity42 connections were involved , but also evidence that the attacks could have erupted spontaneously , they said , adding that government experts wanted to be cautious about pointing fingers prematurely			0
@entity8 intelligence officials have emphasized since shortly after the attack that early intelligence reporting about the attack was mixed			0
spokesmen for the @entity2 and @entity16 had no immediate response to requests for comments on the emails			1
by the morning of september 12 , the day after the @entity9 attack , @entity51 reported that there were indications that members of both @entity20 , a militia based in the @entity9 area , and @entity244 , the @entity245 affiliate of @entity42 's faltering central command , may have been involved in organizing the attacks			1
fourteen hours after the attack , president @entity153 sat down with @entity250 of ‘ @entity155 ’ for an interview and said he did not believe it was simply due to mob violence , @entity248 reported			0
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours ‘ you 're right that this is not a situation that was -- exactly the same as what happened in @entity269 and my suspicion is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target @entity8 from the start , ’ @entity153 said			0
one @entity8 intelligence official said that during the first classified briefing about @entity9 given to members of @entity280 , officials ' carefully laid out the full range of sparsely available information , relying on the best analysis available at the time			2
' the official added , however , that the initial analysis of the attack that was presented to legislators was mixed			0
‘ @entity291 said extremists were involved in attacks that appeared spontaneous , there may have been a variety of motivating factors , and possible links to groups such as ( @entity244 and @entity20 ) were being looked at closely , ’ the official said .			0
