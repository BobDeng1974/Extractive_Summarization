when going on a holiday many of us fear the inconvenience of having to claim lost items , missing luggage or even delayed flights - but what about having your finger bitten off by a rhino ? seasonal travellers often forget that unusual circumstances can happen while on an overseas holiday , with a number of extraordinary insurance claims making their way to @entity17 insurance companies in recent times			1
@entity19 from @entity20 told @entity21 that most people would be surprised at how many unusual claims come through			1
wrong bullseye : a man spearfishing overseas , mistook his foot for marine life and impaled himself undercover adultery : a woman suffered a motorcycle accident whilst holidaying with her secret boyfriend , while her husband was at home in @entity17 ' @entity17 are becoming very adventurous when they travel , trying to seek a unique experience - sometimes in the hunt of that they can come across circumstances that they were n't expecting , ' ms @entity19 said			1
' you tend to find yourself in these unusual situations when you expand your horizons and become more adventurous			1
' who would ever think they would get their finger bitten off by a rhino at a zoo or be involved in a motorcycle accident while on a holiday with your secret boyfriend , who your husband was n't aware of ? - now that is pretty weird , ' she said			0
good karma backfires : a volunteer helping animals at a zoo had his finger bitten off by a rhino other unusual claims have seen an @entity17 man attending a @entity61 festival in the @entity62 who accidentally set his beard alight while trying to help a fire - breather , another man mistaking his foot for marine life while spear - fishing and also a young male falling from his hotel balcony after attempting to throw a cheese burger to his friend , @entity69 reports			1
ms @entity19 said that claims are reviewed by analyst specialists who are trained at investigating the level of care that would have been taken during the incident			0
they determine whether the person was at fault or if it was out of their hands			0
' the cheeseburger claim came from an @entity17 guy holidaying in @entity89 - you do n't think that those things happen on holiday but we found out that the balcony was actually never fixed correctly so it was a legitimate claim			1
' he was running at full force and threw a cheeseburger to a friend on an adjacent balcony - he flipped and fell			0
' the balcony did n't provide enough assistance and the accident impeded on his holiday experience , ' ms @entity19 said			0
she said that unusual claims tend to be made more frequently during the june / july winter period when people go skiing or during christmas time when @entity17 opt to take longer holidays			1
' as the busier travel periods come around we tend to see more of these unusual claims come up			1
' aside from those unusual and unlucky medical claims , ms @entity19 said the whole lost luggage saga is still a very common claim made by @entity17 travellers			1
losing your luggage is one thing , but losing your luggage as a bride is a whole other story			2
hipster horror : an @entity17 attending the @entity61 festival tried to help a fire - breathing hipster when he accidentally set his beard alight ' we have had a claim from an @entity17 bride getting married in @entity128 - she arrived at the hotel and left her wedding dress and shoe bag in the foyer			2
' it had her garter , her wedding ring , her husband â€™s wedding ring , her dress and shoes in the bag - the hotel concierge slung that bag over another bag that was taken by another guest - it was never returned			0
' that was extremely stressful for the bride , she had to go out locally to buy another dress and we paid her out			0
' ms @entity19 said that no two cases are ever the same but assisting travellers and making sure they are safe is always a number one priority			0
' in the first phone call we have to make sure they are in a safe situation and can be moved safely - people call us very quickly you 'd be surprised			0
' we advise them to immediately seek medical care and make sure they go to a facility for an assessment			0
' she said @entity17 are very fortunate to have the highest level of medical care available			2
travellers often opt for the cheapest insurance policy and forget that extraordinary things do happen while on the other side of the world			1
' in the excitement of booking holidays people may not spend an appropriate amount of time assessing what their insurance covers them for			2
' people need to think , " well if i want to have that open ended experience and pick up those different tours and opportunities then i should make sure i am legally able to claim fully in case something happens " " , ms @entity19 said			0
