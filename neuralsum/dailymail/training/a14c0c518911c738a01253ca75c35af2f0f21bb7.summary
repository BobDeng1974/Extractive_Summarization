the papers , in which @entity277 claims @entity72 has been having sex with @entity31 since 2010 , went on : ‘ @entity0 has flaunted that grotesque lifestyle in front of and in his wife ’s face for nearly their entire marriage of 50 years			1

further , this is not the “ first rodeo ” as the expression goes			0
’ @entity72 ’s lawyer , @entity297 continued : ‘ it is clear from past conduct , that mrs @entity31 has at a minimum , either “ enabled ” @entity0 to do , over and over again what he does , or that she approved of the varied and many gifts as described in the complaint			2
‘ the “ relationship ” ( whatever it may have been or not been ) between @entity0 and @entity306 was open , notorious , obvious and long standing			0
