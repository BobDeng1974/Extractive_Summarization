the @entity0 today launched an extraordinary attack on @entity2 , claiming that after stabbing his brother in the back he now wants to do the same to @entity5			1
defence secretary @entity6 claimed the @entity8 leader was willing to trade away @entity5 's nuclear deterrent in order to secure power in a backroom deal with the @entity13			1
mr @entity2 said the @entity15 campaign had ' descended into the gutter ' and claimed @entity17 ' should be ashamed '			1
deeply personal : defence secretary @entity6 claimed @entity2 is ' so desperate ' for power he is willing to weaken @entity5 defences to win support from @entity21 he confirmed that a @entity15 government would go ahead with four new @entity24 nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet , at a cost of £ 100billion			1
@entity8 rushed to say it was also backing four submarines , despite @entity28 last month saying he was examining the idea of cutting it to three			2
doubt has been cast on @entity8 's commitment to the deterrent because mr @entity2 could be forced to rely on the @entity21 support to form a government			1
@entity21 leader @entity36 has made clear that scrapping the @entity24 missile system , which is based in @entity38 , would be a red line for her propping up a @entity8 government in @entity41			1
mr @entity6 launched a highly personal attack on mr @entity2 , saying it was an issue of trust and leadership			1
he told @entity47 's today programme : ' we need to be absolutely clear when we come to this decision in the next parliament			0
' we saw in that leadership election just what he would do to get into power			0
we saw what he did to his own brother			0
we need to know what he would do			0
' we ca n't be sure what kind of backstairs deal he is likely to do with the @entity21 ... that is the uncertainty			2
we have seen what he is prepared to do to get into power			0
' in a speech today , he said : ' @entity2 stabbed his own brother in the back to become @entity8 leader			1
now he is willing to stab the @entity5 in the back to become prime minister			2
' mr @entity6 will insist the @entity0 would ' never ' do a deal on the future of @entity24 in another coalition – and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the @entity8 leadership can not be trusted not to risk the nation 's security			1
' @entity36 could not be clearer			0
she has told @entity2 that scrapping @entity24 – our country 's vital nuclear deterrent – is a red line she will not cross , ' the defence secretary will say			1
' if he wants the keys to @entity82 , he must abandon any plans to renew our current @entity85 ballistic missile submarines			0
' the @entity21 's childlike world view would sacrifice the long - term security of the @entity5			1
the nuclear deterrent protects all of @entity5 , and the @entity21 represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence			1
@entity5 does n't pay ransoms and the @entity15 would never bow to demands from @entity38 separatists			1
vow : the attack comes as the @entity0 pledge to build a £ 100billion fleet of four new @entity24 submarines mr @entity2 brushed off the criticism , insisting he had ' got use to ' conservative attacks			1
speaking at an event in @entity104 , the @entity8 leader added : ' the @entity15 can throw what they like at me , they can make all the personal attacks on me that they want to , but i 've got use to it			1
' and you know what ? i 'm resilient			0
and i 'm resilient for one reason alone - because i 'm fighting for the @entity5 people in this campaign			2
' i 'm fighting for the kind of country the @entity5 people want			2
' mr @entity2 said that over the first two weeks of the @entity15 campaign , it was clear ' they have nothing positive to say about the country '			1
the @entity8 leader said : ' i think @entity17 should be ashamed			1
he 's got nothing positive to say about the future of the country , he 's got no forward vision for the country			0
and he sends out his minions , like @entity6 , to engage in desperate smears			2
' i think decent conservatives right across our country , decent conservative mps , decent conservative party members , decent people right across @entity5 , will say ` come on , we 're better than this kind of politics '			0
there is mounting @entity8 panic at polls suggesting the rampant @entity21 is on course for a landslide north of the border			1
such a political earthquake would be likely to leave the @entity21 holding the balance of power at @entity41 and determining who is in government for the first time in the 300 - year history of the @entity145			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity146 told the same programme that the @entity148 had made it ' crystal clear ' it supports the renewal of @entity24			2
he said : ' this is desperate stuff from a rattled campaign that spent yesterday defending tax avoidance and is now descending into politics of the gutter			0
' this is not up for negotiation with the @entity21 or with any other party			0
i do n't know how i can say it plainer than that			0
' we are absolutely committed to a continuous at - sea deterrent			0
the @entity0 are like a wounded , cornered animal at the moment			0
' @entity21 leader @entity36 has made clear that scrapping the @entity24 missile system , which is based in @entity38 , would be a red line for her propping up a @entity8 government in @entity41 @entity168 , who used @entity169 to question the £ 100billion cost of the weapons system labour leader @entity2 faces a challenge from dozens of @entity8 candidates calling for @entity24 to be scrapped			1
among them is @entity168 , who used @entity169 to question the £ 100billion cost of the weapons system			0
' how exactly does submarine system designed for @entity179 era combat new threats from international terrorism ? ' she asked			0
' @entity24 could cost £ 100 billion			0
would pay for : 150,000 new nurses ; 1.5 million affordable homes ; 2 million jobs & much more			0
' @entity184 lists 52 candidates standing for election on may 7 calling for @entity24 to be scrapped			0
they call for ' a @entity187 that delivers on disarmament of the @entity5 's nuclear weapons , as we are bound to under the @entity191 '			1
both @entity8 and the @entity21 have ruled out a formal coalition , but left the door open to a looser deal that would see mr @entity2 in power even if he wins fewer seats than the @entity0			1
earlier this year , mr @entity2 suggested he might back a cheaper @entity24 replacement than the current plan , estimated at £ 100billion for four submarines at about £ 5billion each , and annual running costs of £ 3billion over the subs ' lifetime of about 30 years			1
today 's @entity15 pledge puts @entity8 in a difficult position , since ruling out any compromise on @entity24 would infuriate the @entity21 and many voters in @entity38 , where support for the system 's renewal is lower than in the rest of the @entity5			1
mr @entity6 will add today : ' it is a sign of his weakness he has failed to rule out a deal			0
voters can only conclude he would be prepared to trade @entity5 's security just to get his hands on the keys to @entity218			1
' the future of our country 's security will be on the ballot paper too			2
there will be a clear choice between a @entity15 government that will put our national security first			2
or @entity2 , a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the @entity21			2
' @entity232 defence spokesman sir @entity232 said he did not see any need for @entity24 to be patrolling the seas 24/7 while the @entity5 has ' no known nuclear adversary '			1
he told @entity47 's today programme the nuclear deterrent was ' worth retaining ' , but said two submarines would provide a ' perfectly meaningful deterrent ' , although not on a ' continuous basis '			0
retaining three submarines would enable the @entity5 to have a ' continuous at - sea deterrence ' , he added			0
@entity243 , leader of the @entity244 , said : ' this latest round of @entity15 speculation does n't conceal the fact that the @entity148 is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapons system			2
' the truth is that the @entity8 leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending £ 100billion on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs			0
' only one party is standing up to @entity24 across the @entity5			2
@entity260 will put pressure on the government to ensure that a proper debate is had over @entity24			0
