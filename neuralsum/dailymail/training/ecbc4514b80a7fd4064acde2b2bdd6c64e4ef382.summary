@entity0 are left clinging to the hope that @entity2 will beat @entity3 on friday night and then overcome @entity4			1
that way the @entity0 could hatch a ‘ @entity7 ’ with a 2 - 0 win over @entity3 next week providing @entity6 then beat @entity4			1
but of course should @entity11 ’s men lose to @entity3 then this would rank as the country ’s worst - ever @entity15 finals			1
down and ( all - but ) out : @entity17 and @entity18 reflect after @entity0 's defeat against @entity4 match winner : @entity21 is ecstatic after scoring @entity4 's crucial second goal against @entity0 in @entity23 @entity0 have not lost all three group games at a @entity15 since first entering in 1950 ; although @entity0 did lose their three group games at the 1988 @entity26			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity11 has already batted off the ‘ will you resign ? ’ questions with a ‘ no ’			0
publicly the @entity29 stand firm behind the manager			1
not least because chairman @entity31 suggested when he took over that a bloody nose was expected in @entity33 but with a long term aim of a young side developing at @entity36			0
@entity11 is seen as the right man not least because there are no obvious or wiling replacements			0
but there are some around the @entity29 who are not convinced and there is a growing feeling that despite no experience at club level @entity43 could fit the bill			1
successor ? some in the @entity29 believe @entity43 could fit the bill to replace @entity11 as @entity0 manager just to confirm that while many @entity50 football fans are revelling in @entity0 trouble 's a pal from @entity53 rang me on thursday to gloat about @entity4 's 2 - 1 win			1
he could n't resist reading out the back page headline from one of the @entity50 editions of the papers			0
as schadenfreude goes that 's quality			2
delighted : one @entity50 football fan sat among the @entity4 supporters during @entity0 's defeat keep out for left - footed players in today 's games			1
of the 47 @entity15 goals scored with feet this summer , left - pegged efforts trail right - footed finishes by just one at 23 - 24			1
@entity74 are the fifth @entity15 holders to have been deposed at the first hurdle on their defence			2
the previous four were @entity2 in 1950 ( they had won in 1938 then @entity80 intervened ) , @entity33 in 1966 , @entity81 in 2002 and @entity2 again in 2010			2
four years in football is a very long time to fade			0
now that @entity74 are out @entity83 should at last complete the £ 32 million capture of striker @entity85 from @entity86 next week			0
@entity88 fans will be hoping he does n't go a bit ‘ @entity91 ’ on them and become known as @entity92 all the frontman failed to register a single shot on target during 126 minutes of action in @entity33			0
poor : @entity97 - born @entity85 was a huge disappointment for @entity74 during their first two @entity15 games for many it would seem @entity81 , after their impressive 3 - 0 win over @entity102 , should ease towards the knockout stages against @entity105			1
but the @entity109 , despite the small size of their nation , should never be underestimated and they have a good record against the @entity81			0
in previous meetings between the two sides , the @entity109 have won 12 , @entity81 have been victorious in 15 and there have been nine draws			0
for those not utterly obsessed with football who have a social conscience and concerns about the environment , 16 per cent of the @entity123 rainforest , an area larger than @entity116 , has been cut down since @entity33 lost a competitive home match			0
that was a 3 - 1 defeat to @entity126 in the @entity127 in 1975			2
look out for : @entity128 @entity3 's @entity130 striker caught the eye in their opening win over @entity4 and could well be the player to probe the @entity6 defence on friday evening			1
however , the player that could undermine the @entity6 and stick a knife into @entity0 is @entity128			2
currently with @entity142 club @entity140 , the right back will no doubt be attracting the attention of @entity145 and @entity146 clubs			0
one to watch : @entity3 right - back @entity128 will no doubt attract attention from @entity146 clubs @entity149 the battle of the rainforests between @entity102 and @entity152 could well be a nervy and perhaps feisty affair			2
so 3/1 for the draw looks a decent shout			0
@entity156 @entity2 have a fantastic @entity15 pedigree even if many matches have been tough on the eye			1
but in 1982 they were involved in one of the all - time greatest games when they overcome a brilliant @entity33 side winning late on as @entity164 stabbed home to complete a hat - trick .			2

@entity15 2014 could be @entity0 's worst ever should they lose to @entity3
@entity0 needs @entity2 to win remaining games and need to defeat @entity170 themselves
@entity172 growing among *members* of the @entity29 that @entity43 could fit the bill as the next @entity0 manager
