by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 07:46 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 16 march 2013 a key witness at the @entity2 rape trial has admitted sending a text on the day of the alleged incident saying he said he feared the victim would be raped			1
the text , sent to a fellow @entity10 student at 1.38am on 12 august read : ‘ @entity12 they are going to rape that girl tonight			1
’ it refers to the 16 - year - old victim at the centre of the case and the accused , @entity18 , 16 , and @entity19 , 17			1
@entity20 received text messages from a friend telling him to ' be careful ' on the night of the alleged attack the message was sent from the basement of the house where the alleged assault took place at a time when the sender already knew that the girl had been stripped , photographed and humiliated			1
taking the stand , the former boyfriend of the ‘ victim , ’ an eye witness to some of the night 's events , admitted to taking a picture of her on the floor lying on her stomach , naked and unresponsive , before sending the text and leaving the house soon after			1
barely an hour later , at 2.36am , he texted @entity45 : ‘ be careful bro			1
’ asked by state prosecutor @entity52 , ‘ in all of your knowledge of what happened why would you send a text like that ? ’ he replied : ‘ i was worried he might do something stupid and get himself into trouble			2
’ ‘ kind of like what ’s happened ? ’ she asked			2
he replied : ‘ @entity59			2
’ and though the witness , a lifelong friend of @entity18 and @entity63 teammate of @entity45 , attempted to downplay those fears , they were underlined with a series of texts he sent that same morning to yet another friend			1
the string of communications culiminated in one sent at 2.42am which read simply : ‘ @entity71 got raped i think			0
’ asked why he would send that he replied : ‘ i do n’t know			0
’ @entity18 is charged with rape and dissemination of nude images of a minor in a text sent later that morning the witness described the ‘ victim ’ as ‘ basically dead			1
’ he went on : ‘ they were feeding her alcohol like it was water all night long			0
’ the case in which two high school football stars stand accused of raping a catastrophically drunk young girl has taken over the city of @entity1 and caught the national attention			1
the attention it has drawn is thanks , in large part , to the extent to which it has been played out over social media			0
a now infamous instagram picture of the ‘ victim ’ being carried from a party by her wrists and ankles and a video posted on @entity103 in which a drunk youth mocks her as ‘ dead ’ and ‘ so raped ’ proved crucial to the discovery of a crime of which the ‘ victim ’ claims to have no memory			1
@entity18 faces two charges : rape and dissemination of nude images of a minor			1
@entity45 faces a rape charge alone			1
the prosecution does not hinge on establishing , ‘ consent or force ’ but on the ‘ victim ’s ’ substantial intoxication			1
once again the court heard witnesses describe a night on which the ‘ victim ’ – a petite brunette , wearing only denim shorts , a light shirt and flip flops that night – was seen stumbling , slurring her words , vomiting on the street and then later in the basement of a house to which she had been carried			1
it was a night of back to back end of summer parties , of underage drinking , slushies mixed with vodka , beer pong and music blaring			0
and according to three eye witnesses – each of whom attempted to invoke the 5th amendment and not testify – it resulted in the alleged victim naked , pictured , digitally penetrated and degraded			2
asked to describe the scene he walked into when he arrived at the third and final house of the night , the scene of the incident , the ‘ victim ’s ’ former boyfriend said : ‘ she was on the ground			1
she was laying on her stomach			0
’ asked if she had any clothing on he responded : ‘ no. ’ he continued : ‘ @entity18 was just walking around the basement – by her and away from her at different times			1
‘ @entity19 was behind her			0
on his stomach , by her feet			0
’ asked : ‘ was his face in a position to lick between her legs ? ’ he said ‘ yes			0
’ the witness claimed he tried to stop the accused but was told ‘ not to worry about it			0
’ fury : the notorious picture posted on @entity174 , right , and footage which appeared on @entity103 , left , of the incident has sparked nationwide anger throughout a series of humiliations the ‘ victim ’ was , he said motionless and unresponsive			2
at one point @entity18 attempted to ‘ wake her up … nudging her shoulders			1
’ she did not respond			0
the next day , a female witness who arrived at the same house in the early hours of the morning andstayed the night , testified that she had to help the ‘ victim ’ to put on her bra			2
the victim left in some disarray , without her underwear , earings , cell phone or flip flops – her flip flops werer later retrieved from the site of the second party			2
in the days since the trial began on wednesday visiting judge @entity198 has heard hour upon hour of testimony			0
much of the court ’s time has been occupied with the minutiae of play by play text accounts as he , like the victim , has been tasked with joining the dots of what truly happened on the night of 11 - 12 august			1
it is a task complicated many times over : by the unreliable sexual boasts of 16 year old boys , the various versions recounted by witnesses to friends , authorities and ultimately the court , the consumption of alcohol on the night , peer pressure and shame in the glare of scrutiny , multiplied by the fact that this is a town where everybody knows everybody and technical limitations			1
judge @entity198 is presiding over the court room in @entity1 , @entity2 images deleted from @entity233 , which many involved have , can not be retrieved			0
much has been made of the pressure that the media attention and the involvement of groups such as @entity238 has placed on witnesses , the accused and the victim herself			2
but according to detective @entity243 , now an officer at the @entity244 ( @entity245 ) but with the @entity246 of @entity247 at the time , the initial investigation was hampered by fear which existed long before the rest of @entity250 had directed its attention on this town or this case			0
he said : ‘ the perception that i had was there was a lot of fear , not related to the issues we have seen more recently			0
at that point it really was all			0
. i do n’t know for certain but it seemd to be fear of co-operation , of talking with the police			0
or , as some in @entity1 and beyond would have it , of speaking out against the much lauded @entity10 athletes			1
@entity18 for one certainly appears to have believed his status as a star @entity271 player – he was quarterback – and the power of coach @entity273 would be enough to smooth away any awkwardness			1
in a series of texts to a female friend on 13 august he responded to her question , ‘ what did @entity279 say to you last night ? ’ ‘ nothing really			2
we got to stay in for a week			0
next time nay of use to anything we are suspended from games …			0
but i feel like he took care of it for us			0
’ but that same day in a @entity292 conversation the victim wrote : ‘ i woke up naked like i seriously have no memory at all			2
’ she claimed to have undergone a toxicology test which had confirmed her own assertions that she had been drugged on the night in question			0
but @entity298 understands that in spite of her assertions no such tests were ever conducted – a fact expected to be exploited by the defence when they make their case .			0

allegedly refers to high school footballers @entity18 , 16 , and @entity20 , 17 , and 16 - year - old victim
sent to fellow @entity10 student at 1.38am on 12 august
former boyfriend of victim also texted @entity45 saying ' be careful bro '
