by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 08:54 est , 3 june 2013 hi there beauty chums			1
i 'm trying my best to stay smiley but you have to agree it ’s been a pretty glum summer so far - rain , rain , freezing wind , and more rain			1
until we finish work on this series of made in @entity15 i ca n't even jet off to the sunshine			1
boo ! so to cheer myself up this week , i invited the girls round for a make - up party			1
as a beauty blogger , i am very lucky to get sent tons of products to test			1
we had all sorts of girly fun trying out new make - up colours and ideas , and it gave me the chance to experiment with one of this year 's biggest beauty looks : attention - grabbing eyebrows			1
i 've blogged before about eyebrow grooming , and what a huge impact shaping your brows can have on your overall look			1
a professional session with a brow waxer or threader leaves you looking elegant and polished in no time			1
bigger is better : this week @entity0 had the chance to experiment with one of this year 's biggest beauty looks : attention - grabbing eyebrows to look like @entity46 semi-permanent make - up treatments can also boost a brow depleted by years of plucking and i had a treatment with one of the @entity54 's leading experts @entity52 and she really created a much stronger framing of my brow with her @entity58 treatment			1
you can see the difference in the before and after shots			1
it 's not just about well - groomed eyebrows though			1
@entity46 has been the hot model for the last 18 months , and her thick , bold brows have prompted a major beauty trend			1
i 'm lucky enough to have a nice healthy pair , but there 's always room for improvement			1
hence this week 's subject : @entity71 's @entity70 how to do @entity72 with @entity0 step 1 : apply your base brows are the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make - up look			1
the @entity80 creates a wonderfully even , matte base			2
it 's quite thick , so you only need to apply a little to conceal shadows and achieve a smooth finish			2
dab a little foundation onto the back of your hand , then apply it to the face using a foundation brush and blend with your fingers			2
step 2 : highlight your eyes get the look : brows are the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make - up look the eyes need to be subtle , so as not to distract from your bold brows			2
so i 've used this pretty @entity103 eyeshadow in @entity104 just to add a hint of sparkle			2
apply the eyeshadow using a small , angled brush , blending it across the whole eyelid and in the tear duct to brighten your eyes and create a flattering wash of pale , shimmery colour			2
step 3 : add a darker shade it ’s always nice to add a little definition to your eyes , so apply a soft line of the @entity120 eyeshadow along the upper and lower lash lines and into the crease of your eyelid using a small brush			2
bareminerals eyeshadows are packed with colour and a little goes a long way , so be careful when applying this darker shade as you do n't want to overdo it			2
step 4 : luscious lashes finish off your eyes by emphasising your lashes - both upper and lower - with a couple of coats of mascara			0
the slimline brush on the @entity139 is especially good for lengthening your lashes , so the results look natural but lush			0
step 5 : tidy and wax your brows now for the brows			0
if you 've not used brow wax before , do n't be afraid - it 's a brilliant way to groom your brows , smoothing the shape and fixing the brow hairs in place			0
simply use the small mascara brush that comes with the @entity154 to blend the wax from the palette into your brows			0
step 6 : shape and darken the best way to achieve a bold yet natural finish is to apply your brow colour in tiny strokes			0
i used the small angled brush and the darker brow colour from the @entity139 palette , but there 's a lighter shade to choose if you have fair hair			0
gently build up the colour until you achieve the desired shape and thickness			0
wax lyrical : if you 've not used brow wax before , do n't be afraid - it 's a brilliant way to groom your brows , smoothing the shape and fixing the brow hairs in place step 7 : highlight your brows next use the pinky colour from the brow palette , blending it underneath your eyebrows			0
this is a clever little make - up trick that helps highlight your brow bones and adds more definition to the eyes			0
step 8 : brush on your bronzer finally , its bronzer time - my favourite ! blend @entity193 across the cheekbones and along the side of the forehead using a large powder brush			0
you know how much i adore wearing bronzer but for this look i 've taken things easy and not added too much as it might draw attention away from the eyes			0
and that 's it - eight easy steps to brilliantly bold brows ! i did n’t add anything to my lips for this look , but for a sheer and subtle touch of lip colour i ’d recommend a moisturising lip butter like @entity214 in the shade @entity216			0
i 'd definitely recommend investing in the @entity139 brow palette to keep your brows looking super-groomed			0
however , those of you on a budget could try these lower cost brow boosters : @entity223 , £ 2.69 , @entity224 , £ 3.50 , @entity225 , £ 8.50			0
