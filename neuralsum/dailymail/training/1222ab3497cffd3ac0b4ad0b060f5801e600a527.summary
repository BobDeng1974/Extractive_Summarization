by @entity0 last updated at 9:42 pm on 16th february 2012 the careworn house not far from @entity2 resembles millions of other homes that have been foreclosed on since the calamitous @entity5 housing crash four years ago			0
garbage spews from trash bags behind the property			0
a smashed television leans against broken furniture			0
a filthy toy dog lies on its side , an ear draped across its face			0
the house needs a paint job			0
yet the property on @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , is no ordinary foreclosure			1
foreclosed : this sprawling , @entity24 - style estate is one of many foreclosures in @entity20			1
its former owners were $ 205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $ 6.9 million a sprawling , @entity24 - style estate , fringed by majestic pine trees and located near the boutiques of @entity2 , its former owners were served with a default notice in 2010 ; they were $ 205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $ 6.9 million			1
welcome to foreclosure @entity20 - style			1
some 180 houses in @entity20 , the storied @entity38 enclave rich with @entity40 stars and music moguls , have been foreclosed on by lenders , scheduled for auction , or served with a default notice , the highest level since the 2008 financial crash , according to a @entity48 analysis of figures compiled by @entity50 , which tracks foreclosures nationwide			1
as in the default - ravaged suburban subdivisions of @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 , @entity57 , plunging real estate prices are the root of the problem in @entity20			1
but the dynamics of the residential real estate collapse are very different in elite neighborhoods such as this			0
the majority of delinquent homeowners here owe more than $ 1 million			1
many are walking away not because they ca n't pay , but because they judge it would be foolish to keep doing so			0
' it 's a business decision , not an emotional one which it is for normal people , ' said @entity73 , owner of the @entity74 at @entity75 , which specializes in high - end properties in the @entity38 area			0
' i go to cocktail parties and all people are talking about is whether it is time to walk away , although they will never be quoted in the real world			0
' the mansion , overgrown , abandoned and badly in need of a paint job , is one of 180 foreclosures in the wealthy @entity38 enclave she said she had seen in @entity20 a big increase in ' strategic defaults , ' in which owners who can still afford to make their monthly mortgage payment choose not to because the property is now worth so much less than the giant loan used to buy it during the housing bubble			1
strategic default is an especially appealing option in @entity21 , one of only a handful of @entity5 states where primary mortgages made by banks are ' non-recourse ' loans			1
that means the loan is secured solely by the property , and banks can not go after a delinquent owner 's wages or other assets if they default			1
@entity73 said she helped a client buy a @entity20 mansion last year that the prior owner had bought for over $ 4 million			1
he decided to stop paying his $ 3 million mortgage - even though he could easily afford it - when the value of the property had dropped to $ 2.5 million			2
' they were able to comfortably cover the loan , ' @entity73 said			0
' they were just no longer willing to see the value of the property drop			0
' a huge ' shadow inventory ' is building of elite homes that are in default but have not been put on the market			2
of the 180 distressed properties in @entity20 , only 12 are up for sale			1
the backlog reflects the pent - up flood of foreclosed properties of all price ranges that are expected to hit the @entity5 market this year , especially after five major banks reached a $ 25 billion settlement last week with the @entity5 over fraudulent foreclosure practices			2
default is a popular option in @entity21 as banks can not go after other assets , only the property used to secure the loan			1
that is not the case in most states , including foreclosure ridden @entity57 , where the pictured home is located across the @entity5 , the largest increase in foreclosures and delinquencies , compared with 2008 levels , is with ' jumbo ' mortgages - loans too large to be insured by @entity154 and @entity155 , the government controlled mortgage finance providers			2
foreclosures on jumbo loans are up 579 percent since 2008 , greater than any other form of loan , according to a report last month by @entity163 strategic defaults are now more likely among jumbo loan - holders than any other type of borrower , according to a report issued late last year by @entity169 nearly 40 percent of delinquencies among non-governmental mortgages , which are mostly jumbo loans , are strategic defaults , the report said			2
' now that these homeowners with jumbo loans are finding out you can do this , more and more are doing strategic foreclosures , ' said @entity178 the ceo of @entity180 , which advises homeowners who are ' underwater , ' the term for those whose loans exceed the value of their home			1
@entity186 , a @entity20 lawyer , insists he is not a strategic defaulter - that he never missed a mortgage payment in his life			1
but he stopped making payments on his five - bedroom , six - bathroom @entity20 house on @entity193 three years ago			2
@entity186 , who had mortgages totaling $ 3 million with the now - defunct @entity195 , returned home one evening in january 2009 to find a letter from @entity195 freezing his $ 150,000 line of credit , which was linked to his second $ 900,000 loan			1
his primary loan was $ 2.1 million			2
the property is worth about $ 2 million today			2
@entity186 says he decided to stop paying out of a sense of vengeance from the moment he received that letter			0
he has been in negotiations for months with @entity206 , which took over @entity195 after its collapse , to modify the loan			0
' i thought to hell with it , ' he told @entity48			0
' why should i keep feeding a dead horse if the bank has no confidence in me ? ' ' i was able to maneuver things my way because of the inertia of the banking sector , ' @entity186 said			0
he believes the bank will blink first , and eventually modify his loan .			0

majority of delinquent homeowners in @entity20 owe over $ *1million*
' strategic default ' popular as in @entity21 mortgages can be secured just by the home and banks can not go after other assets
