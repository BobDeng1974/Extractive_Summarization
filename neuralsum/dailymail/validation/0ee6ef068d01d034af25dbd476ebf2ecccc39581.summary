prince @entity0 arrived in @entity1 tonight for one of the most high - profile – and diplomatically sensitive – tours of his fledgling royal career			1
following four successful days in @entity7 , the future king flew on to @entity8 where he was greeted at the @entity10 - designed @entity9 by @entity12 ambassador @entity11 , @entity12 's first female ambassador to the country			0
also present was the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity12 , @entity15 , and ambassador @entity16 of the @entity19 's @entity18			0
stepping foot for the first time on @entity1 soil , the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the royal family to visit the country since the @entity43 nearly 30 years ago			1
in truth , many had believed that @entity0 ’s father , prince @entity46 , would be the first to stake that claim			2
the @entity43 ’s heir has been assiduously courting the @entity1 in recent years on behalf of his charities , setting up a number of initiatives in the country , including @entity54 ( @entity1 ) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture			0
he has also met with several senior @entity58 leaders in the @entity12			1
however he has also made no secret of his personal , and deeply held , opposition to @entity1 actions in @entity62 , regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader , the @entity63 ( reviled in @entity8 as a dangerous separatist ) , to @entity66			0
the pair have even been photographed holding hands			0
prince @entity0 with the @entity12 ambassador @entity11 after taking part in the formal handover of the former @entity12 colony of @entity72 in 1997 to @entity1 , @entity46 also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as ‘ appalling old waxworks ’			1
two years later let it be known he was boycotting a @entity79 banquet in honour of the then visiting president of @entity1 , @entity81			2
@entity0 ’s grandfather , prince @entity82 , also has form in the country			2
during the @entity43 ’s 1986 visit to @entity1 he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of @entity12 students : ‘ if you stay here much longer , you ’ll all be slitty - eyed			2
’ something of a herd of elephants in the room , then , for 32 - year - old @entity0 to manoeuvre – and that ’s even before he flies to the west of the country to visit @entity1 ’s own dwindling band of wild @entity100 elephants and convince the locals to curb their demand for ivory and other illegal animals products			1
first , however , he will spend a morning in @entity8 , visiting the exquisite @entity105 – the ancient home of @entity1 ’s deposed emperors - as well as a traditional @entity108 , a traditional narrow alley unique to the country			1
he will also meet several senior @entity58 leaders , including , it is believed , the @entity1 premier , @entity113			1
with @entity1 on course to overtake the @entity116 as the world ’s largest economy , the @entity12 government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and @entity0 ’s visit will be seen as part of that			1
given the sensitivity of these meetings the prince – who is putting off becoming a full - time working royal for at least two years to work as an air ambulance pilot – will have to show both maturity and diplomatic dexterity			2
the royal is scheduled to visit the @entity105 – the ancient home of @entity1 ’s deposed emperors ( pictured : @entity0 with @entity11 ) he will no doubt be grateful for the assured presence of the @entity43 ’s favourite diplomat , sir @entity131 , who has accompanied him to the @entity133 at her request			1
later on monday he will fly to @entity135 to embark on a concerted push to promote @entity12 business and culture when he opens the government ’s great festival of creativity at the city ’s @entity142			0
the festival is designed to showcase @entity12 innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health , technology , education and entertainment			0
he will even attend the premiere of home - grown success story @entity154 , although @entity0 will be too busy to see the actual film			0
it ’s a packed programme and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince ’s wife , the @entity160 , had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy , @entity0 has made the right noises so far , it seems			2
earlier in the day the @entity82 was in northern @entity7 , where he was greeted by @entity1 - style lions thousands of well wishers lined the streets during his visit to the @entity170 in @entity171 , northern @entity7 earlier today in @entity7 he even threw his usual caution to the wind and was persuaded to don a samurai outfit – although drew the line at a ponytailed wig			0
earlier today he looked delighted to be greet by a traditional @entity177 as he visited the north - eastern city of @entity179 , which was devastated by a tsunami in 2011 , which killed some 19,000 people			0
@entity0 placed a bouquet at a hilltop shrine and was mobbed by wellwishers , taken aback by the prince ’s willingness to interact , in stark comparison with the rather staid nature of their own @entity190 family			0
@entity0 placed a bouquet at a hilltop shrine for the victims of march 11 , 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity179 , @entity7 prince @entity0 took a moment to remember the victims of the tsunami at the hilltop shrine			1

prince @entity0 is visiting @entity1 for the first time
while there , the royal will take a tour of @entity105 and visit a @entity108
he will also meet several senior @entity58 leaders during the trip
the @entity1 tour is one of the most diplomatically sensitive of his career
