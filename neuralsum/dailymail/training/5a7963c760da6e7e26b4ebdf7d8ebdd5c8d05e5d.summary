by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 11 july 2013 when toddler @entity3 leapt through an open first - floor window , his horrified parents feared he would be killed			1
but the 23 - month - old survived the 20ft fall on to a patio with only a cut knee and a bruised forehead – and it seems his favourite movie character may be the reason			1
@entity3 ’s mother thinks he may have been trying to copy @entity13 , the astronaut from the @entity15 films who launches himself into the air with the cry ‘ to infinity , and beyond ! ’ as he tries – mostly unsuccessfully – to fly			1
his parents found him standing on the patio covered in blood - but doctors could n't find any damage apart from a cut knee and bruised forehead on young @entity3 doctors say @entity3 survived because he was not scared when he jumped , so his body was totally limp as he hit the ground			1
experts believe you are more likely to survive a fall if your muscles are relaxed			2
they think it helps cushion the impact , acting rather like shock absorbers			0
if the muscles are tense , as would instinctively happen during a fall , the force travels straight to the organs , spine and limbs , causing major injuries			0
in car accidents , passengers who are asleep have been known to suffer fewer injuries than those who are awake and brace themselves for impact			0
@entity3 's brother @entity48 , 3 , with mother @entity49 and the toddler with father @entity51 stand on the spot where the youngster was found @entity3 had been playing with his brother @entity55 and father @entity51 , 34 , when he bolted towards the open window at their home in @entity59			1
@entity3 tumbled out the first storey of his home and crashed onto the patio despite his father ’s desperate lunge to stop him , @entity3 leapt out			1
his mother @entity49 , 27 , said yesterday : ‘ i was in the other room when i heard @entity51 screaming , “ @entity67 , @entity3 ’s fallen out of the window ”			1
' i screamed and rushed to the garden			0
i did n’t know what i ’d find			0
' i found @entity3 standing up with blood all over his face and crying			1
‘ i snatched him up and hugged him and my mum called the ambulance			0
' i was wiping the blood out of his eyes when the paramedics arrived			0
‘ he was in accident and emergency for hours as they did x-rays on his whole body , an mri scan and ultrasound checks – but he did n’t have any broken bones			2
' the nurses said what saved his life was that he was n’t scared and did n’t stiffen up when he fell			2
' he also bounced off the lower window sill , which broke his fall a bit			2
‘ he has been the talk of the hospital			0
he ’s a massive fan of @entity13 so maybe he can fly too			2
to infinity ! by copying @entity13 , the boy managed to survive the high fall			0

@entity3 , one , was playing with his brother when he fell 20ft from a window
he was relaxed as he thought he could fly so did n't break any bones
