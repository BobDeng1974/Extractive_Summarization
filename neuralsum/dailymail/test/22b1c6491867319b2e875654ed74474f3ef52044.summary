@entity0 saved his goalkeeper 's blushes with a late equaliser which put defending champions @entity4 into the last four of the @entity5			1
@entity6 had looked to have cost his side their progress , with the game heading towards extra time , before substitute @entity0 arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining			1
it had been a risk to start the @entity14 keeper , but @entity4 boss @entity15 decided it one he was prepared to take , despite @entity6 's absence since a game against @entity18 in the first week of february			1
@entity19 slams home the early penalty after @entity21 had been brought down by @entity22 after five minute @entity23 celebrates his goal with @entity25 but @entity26 could n't hold on for extra time in the end it was a gamble that spectacularly back - fired , with the keeper gifting @entity26 two of the softest goals imaginable , to see the holders surrender a two - goal lead in the tie			1
first , just a matter of seconds after the half - time break , with @entity4 two goals up on aggregate a cruising , @entity6 dropped the ball , under no pressure , at the feet of @entity42 , allowing the @entity43 to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards			1
then , when @entity46 forward @entity23 hit a speculative , but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards , @entity6 could only flap it over his own line , turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time			1
but as @entity26 looked to apply the pressure , and @entity6 attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves , one from each of the two goalscorers , the champions struck on the break			2
@entity59 is mobbed by his @entity4 team - mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on @entity26 : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity22 , @entity65 , @entity66 ; @entity67 , @entity25 ; @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity23 , @entity42 ( @entity70 83 mins ) subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 goal : @entity42 48 , @entity23 72 booked : @entity22 , @entity25 , @entity63 @entity4 : @entity6 , @entity79 , @entity80 ( @entity81 22 ) , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity21 ( @entity85 92 ) , banega , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity19 ( @entity0 72 ) subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 goal : @entity59 6 , @entity0 85 booked : @entity81 it was a pulsating finish to a game that had started promisingly , but looked to have faded away somewhat in the first half			1
the @entity98 side carried a slim lead , given them by a stunning @entity85 volley at the end of the first leg , into the second game , but @entity26 were optimistic after scoring an away goal in @entity106 , which gave them a perceived edge			0
that advantage lasted little more than five minutes however , as defender @entity22 stupidly dived in on @entity4 winger @entity21 , to concede an early penalty			1
it was a bizarre challenge to make , with @entity21 running towards the byline , and the ball not even close to within winning distance			0
the contact may have been minimal , but the fact that it was there at all was as much down to @entity22 's stupidity as anything else , and it was hard to feel sympathy for the @entity14 defender			0
@entity19 was not in the mood to show any mercy , dispatching the spot - kick beautifully , high into the top corner , and the visitors were in complete control			2
from then the pattern of play was set , with @entity4 inviting pressure , absorbing it , and hitting @entity26 on the break			0
indeed , the visitors , two goals ahead on aggregate and with the majority of the game in their own half , had much the better chances in the first period			0
@entity82 tries to get a shot away as @entity4 threatened on the break , before @entity26 hit back in the second half @entity26 midfielder @entity25 challenges @entity4 's @entity79 during a tense first half @entity84 should have put them further in front , after out - pacing former @entity146 midfielder @entity67 , but he seemed to forget that running is not enough , failing to either pass or shoot and simply running into @entity147			2
soon after @entity59 sprang the offside trap and rounded the @entity26 keeper , only to see his shot cleared off the line by @entity66			0
@entity153 ' team barely registered a shot before first - half stoppage time , the one exception coming in the 18th minute , when captain @entity68 exchanged passes with @entity23 before seeing his near - post shot saved by @entity6			1
but , as the first 45 approached its conclusion , the hosts suddenly produced a succession of chances , and could easily have got themselves back into the tie			0
@entity42 , whose goal got @entity26 back in the tie , was starved of service for long periods of the game @entity170 , almost entirely ineffectual up front in the opening period , was gifted the ball three yards from goal following some dubious defending at a set piece , but the @entity43 striker could n't sort his feet out , and stumbled the ball away from target			2
moments later @entity68 struck the base of the post with a vicious effort that suggested @entity26 might have more to offer in the final quarter of the tie			0
not that they could have expected the sort of favours that @entity6 handed them in the second period , and which looked to have at least earned them an extra 30 minutes			0
in the end though , it was the home side 's defending that let them down , failing to keep the back door shut as they pushed for a winner , allowing @entity0 to do the damage .			0

@entity19 puts @entity4 ahead from the spot after @entity21 was fouled
@entity42 equalises following blunder from @entity6
@entity6 gives away second goal when he turns @entity23 shot over his own line
@entity0 wins the tie for @entity4 on break in closing minutes
