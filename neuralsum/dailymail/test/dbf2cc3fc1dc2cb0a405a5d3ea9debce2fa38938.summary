mr @entity54 told @entity63 5 live : ‘ i think it is quite distasteful , actually , to reduce this total human tragedy of hundreds of people dying out in the @entity14 to a political point - scoring blame game , particularly , i have to say , from a party that of course brought us into an illegal invasion in @entity62 where there was no planning at all for the aftermath			2
’ mr @entity54 said there should be ‘ a little more adherence to the facts as to who is ending up on these boats , why they are and what we can do about it to stop this terrible human tragedy ’			2

no. look , what this is about is saying very clearly to the @entity109 people that there is a huge issue we face as a country which is learning the lessons of the @entity115			0
‘ the problem is that in relation to @entity26 we have repeated the mistake because we have n’t done the post-conflict planning			0
‘ i think people should just read my words and i do n’t think anybody in the foreign policy community or in the wider international community would disagree with what i ’ve said about the failure of post-conflict planning			2
’ labour aides pointed out that mr @entity0 did raise the issue of post-war plans after supporting bombing raids in @entity26 in 2011			0
but footage of him also emerged from the same year suggesting the new @entity26 authorities should be left to get on with it			0
‘ this is an important moment to recognise the @entity136 and their role in taking @entity26 forward , and we ’ve got to be led by them			0
it ’s very important that @entity26 determine their future , ’ he said at the time			0
