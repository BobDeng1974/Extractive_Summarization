a football press conference is not the usual place to witness a moment of heartfelt compassion			2
yet @entity5 manager @entity4 stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome back @entity11 journalist @entity9			1
@entity9 had recently recovered from thyroid cancer , and the press conference in january was his first day back at work			1
fighting on : @entity11 sports journalist @entity15 , 37 , from @entity16 , was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in august 2013 , after a friend spotted a lump on his neck @entity4 was delighted to see him again , and quickly made his way out from behind his desk to shake hands with the sports reporter while asking him : ‘ all good ? ’ ‘ all good , ’ replied @entity25 , 37 , before adding : ‘ it ’s good to see you back , ’ in reference to the @entity29 manager ’s return to the @entity31 club during the summer			1
speaking today for the first time about his illness and his subsequent return to health , @entity25 explains how the pair had become acquainted months earlier when he asked @entity4 a series of difficult questions at a previous press conference			2
during @entity9 ’s recuperation , @entity4 sent him a get - well card saying : ‘ i miss a difficult question			2
’ the journalist reveals : ‘ being welcomed back by @entity4 was a sweet moment , and as i ’m a @entity5 supporter , when i got the card i said , “ this is almost worth getting cancer for			1
” i was being ironic , of course			2
’ he also found comfort in the words of fellow sports reporter @entity55 , who underwent surgery for the same kind of cancer in 2009			1
letting them know : @entity60 told his colleagues , and the world , that he was suffering from thyroid cancer via social media ‘ i heard her on @entity66 discussing her own thyroid cancer , ’ he explains			1
‘ i welled up and cried			2
she was talking about her treatment – which was very similar to mine – and the worry of who you tell			1
‘ it happened so fast with me i did n’t have time to think			2
you ’re told you have cancer , you get a date for the operation , and then the radiotherapy			1
hearing @entity55 on the radio was the first time i had heard someone talking about surviving it and it struck a nerve with me			2
‘ i ’ve never met her but i ’ve met other people who have suddenly showed me their own surgery scars			2
that ’s the thing with cancer – one in three of us will get it			1
i was perhaps slightly younger than most but it ’s on the cards for a lot of us			2
’ @entity25 was diagnosed in august 2013			1
he says : ‘ i was at a railway station early one morning when a friend of mine spotted the lump by the right side of my @entity100 and asked , “ what ’s that ? ” ‘ i had never noticed it before but i saw a doctor straight away and he said it had been growing for many months			2
it baffles me that i did n’t spot it earlier because the lump was the size of a small plum , but i suppose you do n’t look at that part of your neck much			2
‘ the gp seemed concerned			2
he said it could be a cyst and sent me to hospital for tests			0
’ however , a week later @entity25 was told his lump was cancerous and that he needed surgery to remove his thyroid			1
the butterfly - shaped gland is located in the neck , sitting around the trachea and just below the voice box			0
it is responsible for producing the hormone thyroxine , which regulates the body ’s metabolism – including how fast the heart beats and how much sleep we need			0
once the gland is removed , patients have to take a synthetic form of the hormone in a daily drug dose			0
‘ i was in disbelief , ’ says @entity25 of his initial diagnosis			0
‘ the bad thing is you turn to @entity141 for answers and you end up assuming the worst will happen			0
‘ i had a type of thyroid cancer which has a 90 per cent survival rate – but that still means one in ten people will die			1
’ @entity25 , who lives with his partner , fellow tv reporter @entity148 , says his first concern was how to tell his 11 - year - old daughter @entity150 , his child from a previous relationship			1
‘ i was very open with her , ’ he says			0
‘ i showed her the lump and told her it was something called cancer			1
there was a lot of not knowing what was going to happen – i did n’t want to worry her but i wanted to be honest with her too			0
i had that worry of , “ will i leave my daughter without a father ? ” ’ @entity9 had surgery to remove the cancerous lump in his neck on october 14 last year			1
‘ basically they slit my throat at the base of my neck , ’ he says cheerfully			0
‘ i now have a 3in scar			0
‘ they removed my entire thyroid in an operation lasting about 90 minutes			1
i felt pretty rotten when i came around – very nauseous , and doped up on morphine – but then felt better hour by hour			0
’ after three days in hospital , he went home and he says he felt completely recovered about three weeks later			0
show of support : when @entity25 returned to his job as a sports reporter for @entity11 , @entity5 manager @entity4 stunned onlookers when he halted one of his pre-match briefings to welcome him back however , one of his big concerns was how to tell friends and colleagues he had cancer			1
‘ you get those emails at work saying , “ hi , i ’ve had a baby , ” but it did n’t seem right to do it about cancer , ’ he says			1
instead , while he was in his hospital bed recovering from surgery , @entity9 took a picture of himself and uploaded it to social media site @entity203			0
‘ it got the job done but i was probably a bit out of it on painkilling medication at the time and did n’t consider what i was doing			0
i was fortunate enough to receive a lot of supportive comments			0
’ as a follow - up to the surgery , @entity9 then received iodine radiotherapy treatment			1
professor @entity216 , consultant clinical oncologist at the @entity218 , who treated him , explains : ‘ the thyroid gland absorbs iodine which you get from eating seafood and then converts it into thyroxin , which regulates body function			1
‘ by giving the patient a radioactive type of iodine in the form of a tablet , if there are any thyroid cancer cells left after surgery , they will absorb the radiation and die			1
‘ no other organ in the body is interested in iodine so it ’s an effective targeted treatment			1
’ @entity9 needed only one dose of iodine treatment , although sometimes patients need more			1
an mri scan is also given to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body			1
he took the tablet in an isolated room in a @entity16 clinic and remained there for 24 hours as patients are left radioactive afterwards			0
‘ then staff said i could go home but not to be in contact with children or pregnant women , because i was technically radioactive , ’ he adds			0
@entity9 returned to work in january , when he had that encounter with @entity4 , and is upbeat about the future			1
the prognosis for those who have been effectively treated for differentiated thyroid cancer is good – but they will need to be tested for the rest of their lives as there is a possibility the cancer will recur			1
‘ i have seen a patient where it has returned after 20 years but that ’s rare , ’ says prof @entity216			2
‘ it ’s a cancer that can be cured but may still show up further down the line , and for that reason patients need lifelong follow - up			2
’ @entity9 is still getting used to his new medication			0
at first his dosage needed to be adjusted as he was getting by on just three hours ’ sleep a night			0
‘ i still think it ’s all going to be over but then i realise i ’ll be on those pills until the day i die			0
i forgot to take them one morning recently and was i falling asleep by midday			0
’ thyroid cancer has changed his outlook on life			1
‘ i ’m more spontaneous now , ’ he admits			0
‘ i ’d always wanted to go sky - diving so i ’ll do that soon			0
i do n’t want to delay things because i ’ve realised i ’m not going to be here for ever			0
‘ @entity289 is a way of telling you you ’re not immortal and your body can give up on you and you will die			0
it ’s given me a new appreciation of life			0
you just want to live life and tell your family and friends how much you love them			0
i have a more positive outlook now			0
