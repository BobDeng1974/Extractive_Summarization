@entity0 had placed the @entity2 ’s joint - top goalscorer on standby for this match , insisting he would only turn to @entity4 if absolutely necessary			1
as it turned out , the emergency glass needed to be broken			0
the £ 32million striker was required to stop @entity7 squandering the opportunity to open a seven - point advantage over their title rivals			1
yet all they got was 11 minutes before @entity4 was forced off with a recurrence of the hamstring injury that ruled him out of the international break with @entity15			1
@entity7 striker @entity4 limped off with a hamstring injury shortly after coming on at the interval will he be out for a week , a month , two months , maybe more ? ‘ it ’s too early , ’ said @entity0 , who went on to defend throwing @entity4 on			1
‘ i do n’t say “ gamble ” because we did every test , every scan , the player trained for two days , he was 100 per cent with the team			0
‘ the medical department were convinced he was ready			0
the player was convinced he was ready			0
not for 90 minutes but he was ready to play and to help the team			0
’ in the meantime a chunk of the @entity7 contingent will be wondering how they fill the void left by @entity4			1
they need look no further than this win against @entity34 as the answer presents itself in the form of @entity37 and , of course , @entity39			1
@entity41 striker @entity4 looks despondent as he sits on the turf following another injury to his hamstring @entity39 scored and assisted in the same @entity2 match for the seventh time , and looked like a man ready to rubbish the idea he was too tired to play a full 90 minutes for @entity49 in midweek			1
he tormented the @entity34 defence here at @entity51 , and has scored more @entity2 goals for @entity7 over the past three seasons than any other player			1
that ’s 35 , by the way			0
so , too , was @entity37 equally as clinical against @entity34			2
acting as @entity4 ’s replacement for the starting @entity58 , he proved more than a handful for the visitors on his fourth start for @entity7 in the @entity2			2
it took an outstanding one - handed save from @entity34 goalkeeper @entity63 at full stretch to deny @entity37 ’s deflected shot from giving @entity7 the lead after just three minutes			1
then , four minutes later , it was him again , going close as his curled shot skipped agonisingly wide of the far post			0
the man turned down by @entity71 was given the unfortunate task of trying to fill the boots of @entity4 , but rarely looked shy in doing so			2
yet it remained 0 - 0 as half time approached			0
was it time for @entity0 to roll the dice ? it was in the 32nd minute his patience wore thin			0
@entity4 looks in pain after pulling up at @entity51 during @entity7 's 2 - 1 win over @entity34 @entity7 gave away possession in the final third – not for the first time – and a frowning @entity0 turned to his substitutes ’ bench , gestured at @entity4 with a nod , and the striker began warming up down the touchline			1
a sign he was to be introduced soon enough			0
it took a smidgen of luck for the deadlock to be broken thanks to the quick feet of @entity96 earning a penalty , and @entity39 was cool as ever in putting @entity7 ahead			2
never in doubt , as no player in @entity2 history has taken more and never missed than @entity39			2
yet @entity51 ’s celebrations were short - lived			2
@entity0 ’s frustration grew when @entity103 channelled his inner @entity104 and scored from more than 60 yards out			0
with @entity105 left embarrassed , @entity0 knew it was time to ‘ gamble ’			0
@entity0 was happy to have gambled with @entity4 's fitness despite losing the striker after 10 minutes @entity109 went @entity110 , on came @entity4 for the second half			2
no sooner had he been on the pitch than he had to come off			0
he signalled to the bench after just 10 minutes and was replaced by veteran @entity114			0
yet this was all about @entity7 's go - to guy , @entity39 , and @entity4 ’s worthy replacement , @entity118 ‘ we have three strikers , ’ @entity0 declared afterwards			1
‘ we decided at the beginning of the season to go more with @entity4			2
he won the right of being first choice			0
’ but by this evidence , @entity7 supporters need not lose sleep over their first - choice striker 's injury			1
as @entity34 found out , @entity37 can fill the gap left by @entity4 , and @entity39 is simply every bit a @entity2 title winner in the making			1
@entity39 steps up to stroke home the opener for @entity7 from the penalty spot in the first half @entity37 finishes to put @entity7 back in front after a mistake from @entity34 keeper @entity63			1

@entity7 will be without top scorer @entity4 for at least two games
