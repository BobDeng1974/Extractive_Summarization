cutting costs : doctors are being urged to cut costs by slashing the number of patients they send for cancer tests , a report by @entity7 warns doctors are being urged to cut costs by slashing the number of patients they send for cancer tests , a charity warns			1
@entity14 are being told by @entity16 bosses to reduce referral rates despite wanting more patients screened in the hope that the disease will be picked up at an earlier stage			1
a report by @entity7 says waiting times for treatment are at their highest in four years			1
almost 10,000 waited at least two months from being referred by their gp to surgery , medication or chemotherapy in the first half of 2014			2
this means the @entity16 has breached its target of ensuring that 85 per cent of patients are treated within this time frame – it now stands at 84.4 per cent			2
the charity warns that the cash - strapped health service is struggling to cope with the rising numbers with cancer			1
more than 331,000 @entity40 were diagnosed with the disease last year , up by a quarter compared with the 1970s			0
the report warns that unless the @entity16 invests more money in cancer , waiting times will rise further – which could lead to a drop in survival rates			1
@entity49 , @entity7 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ in many ways , @entity16 cancer services have held up remarkably well			1
‘ staff have bravely dug - in and done their best in the face of overwhelming change , increased demand , squeezed budgets and fragmented leadership			0
but that can not continue indefinitely			0
' more people are surviving cancer than ever before – survival rates in the @entity40 have doubled in the last 40 years because research is delivering better diagnosis and treatments			1
‘ but the number of cases is also going up as the @entity40 population ages			2
' this combination means we ’ll be diagnosing more people , treating more people and helping more people recover from cancer in coming decades			2
’ the charity interviewed doctors who said they were being discouraged by @entity16 clinical commissioning groups ( @entity92 ) – which organise delivery of services – from referring too many patients for tests to diagnose cancer			1
one gp said : ‘ we ’re trying to get people diagnosed earlier , which means an increased referral rate from primary care			0
you ’ve got to increase referral rates to get people in at an early stage of disease			0
‘ the @entity92 mantra is exactly opposite of that			0
you have to reduce your referral rate			0
’ and one hospital manager warned that there might soon be a shortage of beds and nurses for patients needing chemotherapy			0
@entity117 , director of policy and research at @entity120 , said cancer services were in a state of ‘ utter confusion and uncertainty ’			0
but @entity125 , national clinical director for cancer at @entity128 , said : ‘ the @entity16 is successfully seeing 50 per cent more patients than four years ago and survival rates have never been higher			1
‘ almost nine out of ten patients say their care is excellent or very good			0
