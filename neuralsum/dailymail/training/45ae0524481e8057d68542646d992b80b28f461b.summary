sleek , stylish and boasting strong audio quality , the @entity1 headphones are something of a complete package			1
and even though the hefty £ 199 price tag may put some people off , there ’s no hiding their build quality			1
take the shatterproof headband , featuring aluminum hooks and foldable cups			0
or the touch - sensitive controls on the right cup that let you pause and play audio by tapping the centre			0
goodbye wires : earlier wireless headsets suffered from a noticeable dip in audio quality compared to their wired counterparts , but these headphones are a shining example of just how far technology has come this latter feature is slightly fiddly to start with , although more refined than , say , the @entity27 wireless headphones			1
on the left cup is a 3.5mm headphone connector and @entity31 zone , which lets you sync to a mobile device			0
there are no issues with syncing – the process managed by a simple ‘ on / off ’ switch and charging is easy , too , via a smart - looking micro usb cable			0
the impressive packaging – so often the weakest link in high - end headphones – even contains a carry case			2
thankfully , audio echoes overall build quality			1
the 40mm dynamic speakers pack some hefty low - end thump , with minimal distortion			1
pitches take a slight hit - sounding slightly muffled , but are still able to cut through and overall sound - stage is impressive			0
by downloading the @entity54 app , this gives you access to @entity57 , which offers even better performance			2
it also gives you 17 equaliser presets for different music @entity62 insulation is strong but when tested outside some wind noise can intrude			2
a system called @entity66 helps to minimise this when making a call using the in - built microphone			0
topped off with a remarkable 240 - hour battery life in standby and 12 hours of wireless output between charges , and these headphones become pretty irresistible			1
