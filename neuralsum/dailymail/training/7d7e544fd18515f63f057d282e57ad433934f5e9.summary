by @entity0 for @entity1 driving in thick fog can be rather unnerving , with it being difficult to see other cars in the low visibility conditions			2
but a new heads - up - display ( @entity7 ) for cars could alleviate these concerns by showing the position of other cars on the windscreen			1
the fighter - jet - style display can alert drivers to other cars in dense fog and other extreme weather conditions - and this could help avoid a collision			1
researchers at @entity21 have developed a smart heads - up - display for cars ( shown )			1
it can alert drivers to other cars on the road in poor weather conditions the display is being developed at @entity21 ( @entity30 )			1
a photorealistic 3d model of a @entity33 car has been developed for accommodating the @entity7 interface and to enhance the realism of the simulation			1
the driving simulator allows the user to drive in clear conditions and thick fog , clearly illustrating the requirement for @entity7 interfaces to display information which the driver no longer has access to when driving ‘ blind ’			2
more than 150 user trials have already been performed during the evaluation of the different iterations of the innovative @entity7 interface			0
this presents significantly improved response times for a large variety of everyday drivers and reduced the rear collision probability under low visibility by 70 per cent on average			0
it is the work of professor @entity58 and his team , based in the @entity60 and @entity61 ( @entity62 )			0
the display has been developed and evaluated in a @entity65 driving simulator , which allows ‘ drivers ’ to navigate a perfectly recreated stretch of the @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 motorways in a choice of conditions			1
one of the options lets the driver tackle the motorways in dense fog , before giving them the chance to drive the same stretch again using the @entity7			0
when started , the windscreen of the car highlights where other vehicles are on the motorway within a range of 1,300ft ( 400 metres ) and even lets the driver know when it ’s safe to change lanes			0
it 's hoped that the display will eventually be used in the windscreens of real cars to help drivers see other vehicles on the road under low visibility conditions			2
further testing will need to be carried out before the technology is available to the public			0
the display is being tested in a 3d simulation of a @entity33 car			1
this allows drivers to navigate recreated motorways in various weather			1
it could be used in both civilian and emergency services vehicles in future ‘ driving is a demanding psychomotor activity which can be significantly hampered by adverse weather conditions , ’ said professor @entity58			1
‘ drivers ’ spatial and situational awareness suffers in such conditions , as neighbouring vehicles and other objects can be hard to see and avoid			2
' being able to see clearly obstacles on the road while driving , despite visual restrictions such as thick fog , is important to avoid collisions			0
‘ [ @entity126 ] are a potential solution to this problem as they can provide the user with information directly in the field of view , allowing the driver to remain focused on the road			0
' the @entity7 system projects crucial information on the windscreen , using augmented digital input to enhance the real environment			0
' the presented data can provide notification of road markings , the proximity of neighbouring vehicles and warnings of traffic congestion to enhance human responses and improve driving safety			0
