scientists have invented a pioneering ' injectable foam ' device to save wounded soldiers from bleeding to death			1
the groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station			1
biomedical engineers developed the technology after finding traditional methods often ca n't be used on deep neck , shoulder or groin wounds			1
the groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station two liquid chemicals which rapidly form a foam when mixed are stored separately in canisters in an injector device the size of a marker pen			1
in action , a soldier would mix the two chemicals inside the injector and push down on a plunger to insert the expanding foam into a colleague 's wound			2
by filling the wound area , it blocks blood loss during the critical first hour until patients can receive urgent medical treatment			2
the canisters can keep the chemicals - a polyol and a diisocyanate - stable in military conditions at up to 38 ° @entity50 ) for at least a year			0
student @entity51 , from @entity52 , in @entity53 , @entity54 , led the team as part of a course project			2
they came up with the injectable foam system aimed to stop profuse bleeding from a wound near a limb or the head			1
such wounds can typically be difficult to stem , as finding the exact source of blood loss is tricky			1
eight undergraduates at the @entity69 university came up with the idea to beat the weaknesses of using a traditional tourniquet or a gauze pad with a clotting agent			2
they can be difficult to apply effectively to deep wounds on neck , shoulder and groin injuries			1
ms @entity51 said the group wanted to stop soldiers losing more than half their blood before getting to a medical station			2
' the problem is that damage from bullets and bone fragments deep inside a wound is not always visible from outside the body , ' she said			2
' a regular clotting agent may not be able to reach the origin of the bleeding			0
' we came up with a foam injection system that fills the wound area and blocks the blood loss			1
' our project has been dealing literally with a life - and - death matter and at the end of the day , that provided some extra motivation for our team			0

the groundbreaking treatment is designed to stem blood loss while casualties are rushed from the battlefield to a hospital or medical station the students carried out experiments with a gel that mimics the consistency of human tissue			2
they then used a rod to create ' blood vessels ' filled with water within the gel and carved ' wounds ' into the gel to simulate the bleeding process			1
team member @entity153 said : ' the foam fills up the wound opening , hardens , and applies pressure to the walls of the cavity			1
' this should lead to more - effective targeting and treatment at the source of the bleeding			0
' two surgeons proposed and supervised the project at @entity166 , a @entity168 facility in @entity169 , @entity170			0
this is a clinical training site for medics in the @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			0
one of the surgeons , dr @entity176 , a military veteran , said the prototype was very promising			0
' i do n't think it 's pie in the sky at all , ' he said			0
' i think it 's a very viable solution to a problem that 's been plaguing us on the battlefield			0
' all children 's pediatric surgeon @entity186 raised the group 's ' simple , intuitive ' design and said it had the ' potential to save many lives '			0
while no human testing has yet taken place , the students have received university approval to begin animal testing of the prototype system			0

researchers in @entity54 *unveil* device to help soldiers survive injuries
their ' injectable foam ' can be applied to deep wounds to stem bleeding
the device is much more effective than traditional gauze or tourniquets
when applied foam fills the wound and stops blood *escaping*
foam is stored in a canister and has a shelf life of at least a year
