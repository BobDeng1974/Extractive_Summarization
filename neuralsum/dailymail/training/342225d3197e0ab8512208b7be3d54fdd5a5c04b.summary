i said afterwards everyone in football understands what i was trying to do and i just mis - timed it			0

i tried to stop a counter attack and misjudged it			0

with @entity43 and @entity44 to face in the next five days , it could be assumed that the @entity4 striker could take a large step towards surpassing those landmarks , and @entity0 admits it is in the back of his mind			1

' @entity37 is there and if i can overtake him this week , in the coming weeks , the coming months ( then ) that would be great			0
' it 's not something going into the game ( i 'm ) thinking : ' oh , i 've got to beat @entity37 ' record to get close to @entity40 '			0
' i 'm wanting to do well for the team and if i can score goals then great and the most important thing for us is to perform well and to win the games			0
' @entity9 have scored 26 goals in four matches against @entity43 and conceded just one , @entity78 's infamous strike just 8.3 seconds into a @entity80 qualifier in @entity81 in 1993			2
@entity0 will be demanding better concentration on thursday , though the last two meetings in qualifying for this year 's @entity80 brought crushing @entity9 wins , 5 - 0 and 8 - 0			1
' i am enjoying the role of captain and the responsibility and in terms of results it is going very well , ' added @entity0 , ' it 's always nice to score goals but the most important thing is the performance and winning the game			2
