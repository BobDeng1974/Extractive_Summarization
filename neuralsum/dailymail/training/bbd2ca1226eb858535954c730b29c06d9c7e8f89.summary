the money is down but , to here , @entity1 ’s roster has been largely unaffected by their post-ferguson slump			2
they still recruit big players , they still shed the ones of their choosing			0
@entity10 ’s next career move could alter that			2
he is out of contract in summer 2016 , meaning @entity1 will want to get him signed long - term before the start of next season			2
@entity10 , celebrating against @entity16 , could come to symbolise @entity1 's current status @entity18 will be aware , however , that @entity19 are in the market for a goalkeeper , with @entity22 nearing the end of his run			1
if @entity18 stalls , it would be the first sign of @entity1 ’s changing status			1
for @entity18 is not @entity28			1
playing for @entity19 was never his dream			1
he was an @entity30 boy , at the club from the age of 10 until his £ 18m transfer to @entity1 11 years later			0
often , such an upbringing makes a player immune to @entity19 ’s overtures			0
@entity37 said he would never play for them			0
@entity18 dives in an attempt to make a save during @entity42 training last week to lose @entity18 just as he is reaching maturity would be a significant blow for @entity1 but it would equally demonstrate that they can not remain untouched by this slump indefinitely			1
with a long run until the next international break , @entity49 ’s regime must turn the corner			0
the @entity1 keeper injured his finger while training with @entity42 but could be back sooner than expected			0

if @entity10 stalls on a new deal at @entity1 it will be the first sign of their changing status within the game
to lose @entity18 at *24* would be a significant loss for @entity1
playing for @entity19 is *n't* @entity18 's dream as it was @entity28 's
@entity54 qualification is essential for @entity49
