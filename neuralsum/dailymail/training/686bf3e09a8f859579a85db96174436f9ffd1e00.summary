@entity0 took aim wednesday night at @entity2 who have blocked global warming legislation , saying they ' pretend ' they ' do n't read ' science			1
but the president ignored the latest claims that threaten to destroy the @entity11 climate change movement			2
in a speech to the @entity13 , an environmental activist organization , @entity0 mocked the @entity2 for playing dumb on global warming in order to evade the criticism of tea party groups and other elements on their right wing			1
@entity2 have ' ducked the question and said , " hey , i 'm not a scientist " , ' @entity0 claimed , ' which really translates into " i accept that man - made climate change is real , but if i say so i will be run out of town by a bunch of fringe elements , so i am just going to pretend like – i do n't know – i ca n't read "			1
as he tries to rally public support around new @entity51 rules aimed at coal - burning power plants , however , the president has n't yet addressed a brewing scandal in the scientific community			0
global warming specialists inside the scientific community are buzzing about revelations first made friday , which show how the the @entity59 's official graph of historical surface temperatures has been quietly altered for years			1
government scientists , it is alleged , have been tweaking some of the world ’s most oft - cited climate records by replacing actual temperature readings in the @entity11 , @entity66 and @entity67 with hypothetical numbers derived from computer models			1
the result has been a distorted view of temperature trends , according to a blogger who first assembled the evidence , changing a steady temperature decline into an ominous - looking warming			0
the damning graphs published on the ' @entity79 ' blog by @entity80 , the nom de plume of a self - described ' lifelong environmentalist ' with graduate - level scientific credentials			0
they show the impact of replacing the real measurements with computer - generated estimates , in an alleged scheme to de-emphasize temperature readings from earlier decades while giving added weight to more recent numbers			2
@entity0 spoke before an audience of more than 800 enthusiastic environmentalists in @entity94 during a gala hosted by the @entity96 not dying off : an @entity11 climate scientist was forced into retirement after being accused of falsifying data to show polar bears were drowning because polar ice caps had melted they are also tripped up by the changing list of temperature measurement stations , @entity80 writes , as more estimates are used instead of real readings : ' as rural stations are lost , the infilling process contaminates them with warmer urban stations			1
' this , he says , is how the @entity11 government has claimed the earth has been steadily warming by 3 degrees @entity114 per century , while the actual measurements indicate that the planet has been cooling since the 1930s			2
@entity0 , however , steered clear of science on wednesday and accused @entity2 of ignoring global - warming evidence for political advantage			1
' in @entity122 , ' he said , ' folks will tell you climate change is a hoax , a fad , or a plot – a liberal plot			0
' ' if a bunch of doctors tell me that tobacco can cause lung cancer , then i ’ll say , " ok			0
" it ’s not that hard , ' he said to loud applause			0
' climate change ' down under : this graph shows how replacing temperature data taken in @entity140 , @entity67 with computer - modeled approximations has created the impression of warming even in @entity66 : discarding real temperature measurements from 50 or more years ago and replacing them with numbers from computer models has allegedly helped @entity11 government scientists demonstrate nonexistent climate change he said the future efforts to solidify a consensus about climate change will depend on the next generation , including his own daughters			1
' you talk to @entity156 , you talk to @entity157 , you talk to your kids or your grandkids – this is something they get , ' said the president			0
' they do n’t need a lot of persuading			0
' other controversial hiccups have cast the climate wars into disarray in recent years			0
in a 1999 email revealed following the 2009 hacking of an email server at the @entity175 's @entity174 , the institute 's director @entity169 wrote that he had altered the famed ' hockey stick ' graph in order to ' hide the [ temperature ] decline ' shown in scientific data			0
and in december 2013 , an @entity183 scientist whose reported observations of polar bears that had drowned in the polar @entity186 helped motivate the global warming movement was forced into retirement			1
@entity190 , it was alleged by an official at the @entity11 @entity192 , had colluded with another scientist to use false data in is research .			2

the president spoke to a partisan audience of environmental activists on wednesday night in @entity94
he claimed @entity2 *lawmakers* believe global warming is real but wo n't admit it because they *'re* *afraid* of ' a bunch fringe elements ' in their own party
' they ducked the question and said " hey , i 'm not a scientist " , ' @entity0 *joked*
@entity0 ignored new evidence that @entity11 scientists have been altering climate data for years
the @entity11 @entity216 has been *adjusting* its records by replacing temperatures with data *fabricated* by computer models
