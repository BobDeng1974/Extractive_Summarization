by @entity0 the pro-union better together campaign has been criticised for a ‘ sexist ’ advert aimed at winning the support of undecided women voters ahead of the @entity7 referendum			1
nationalist supporters claimed the video , which features a mother talking to the camera about her concerns about independence , depicts @entity7 women as ‘ daft ditherers ’			1
in the broadcast , first shown on @entity7 television on tuesday night , the woman played by an actress says : ‘ there ’s only so many hours in the day and there ’s so much to weigh up ’			1
the ' no ' campaign has been ridiculed in @entity7 after releasing a ' patronising ' video urging voters to reject independence parodies images of the film have been posted online , showing a ' busy mum ' the images mock the message of the official ' better together ' campaign film she says that her off - screen husband , ‘ @entity33 ’ , keeps going on about the referendum and she refers to first minister @entity35 as ‘ that guy off the telly ’			1
a spokeswoman for nationalist campaign group @entity39 said : ‘ we think it 's disappointing that @entity42 decided to portray @entity7 's women in this way			1
‘ the narrative suggests that women who are still making up their minds how to vote do n't understand enough about the issues to arrive at an informed decision			1
that is not our experience			0
they are thoughtful , intelligent and articulate			0
’ the video has been mocked online with people nicknaming the woman ‘ patronising @entity42 ( better together ) lady ’ and posting their own spoof versions of the advert			2
in one the woman is quoted as saying : ‘ maybe i wo n't even bother voting			0
it 's too much hassle			0
i 'll let the men decide whilst i bake cookies in the kitchen ! ’ another @entity66 user posted : ‘ # @entity67 leave the kitchen and shape your future			2
the dour sexist no camp want to transport us back to fifties			0
over my dead body ! ’ while one added : ‘ @entity76 , foodbanks , unelected lords ? i ’ve got a kitchen to clean			0
’ better together said the wording of the advert was drawn from the verbatim comments of women in focus groups and doorstep canvassing			0
@entity86 and @entity87 joined forces today in @entity89 in a bid to check @entity35 's momentum after his crushing win in monday 's live tv debate campaign director @entity94 said : ‘ the key factor for people is n't the love of our country - as both yes and no voters love @entity7			1
the key factor is the love of our families			0
’ he added : ‘ the words spoken in the film are taken verbatim from conversations on doorsteps with undecided women voters and from the opinion of women in dozens of focus groups around the country			0
‘ with so many unanswered questions , more and more of us are coming to the decision that it is just too big a risk to take with our kids ' future			0
’ women have become a key campaign target for both sides of the campaign			1
polls have consistently shown that women are less likely to support independence than men			1
last night , pro-union campaigner @entity127 sarcastically tweeted : ‘ breaking : nationalists do n't like @entity42 campaign material			2
’ a group of 130 business leaders yesterday urged voters to reject @entity7 independence , saying the case ‘ has not been made ’			1
bosses of firms including @entity139 soup , @entity140 and @entity141 signed the open letter , which said : ‘ we should be proud @entity7 is a great place to build businesses and create jobs ... success that has been achieved as an integral part of the @entity148			2
’ meanwhile , past rivals @entity86 and @entity87 put their differences aside to share the no campaign platform , insisting ‘ of course ’ they are friends			0
