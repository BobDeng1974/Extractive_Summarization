@entity0 and @entity1 will be handed a late @entity3 opportunity when they are named in an @entity6 one - day squad laden with experience to take on @entity8 under @entity10 ’s captaincy			1
@entity6 will reveal what is , with the exception of the injured @entity13 , effectively their @entity3 hand when they unveil a 16 - man squad that will rely heavily on the tried and trusted rather than any radical late changes			0
there is no place for @entity20 ’s big - hitting @entity19 , who @entity6 believe is not yet ready for 50 - over international cricket , but there are reprieves for @entity0 and @entity1 who both missed out on the 3 - 1 one - day series defeat by @entity27			1
@entity0 will be handed a late @entity3 opportunity when named in the @entity30 squad to face @entity8 probable squad for @entity8 : @entity10 ( captain ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( keeper ) , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity1 , @entity41 , @entity0 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
the unlucky @entity0 has been consistently overlooked but is finally rewarded for prolific runscoring for @entity48 , particularly in limited - overs cricket , while @entity1 is welcomed back after his controversial omission			0
@entity41 , despite only three hundreds in 148 one - day internationals , makes the cut for a seven - match series in @entity8 that will provide testing preparation for @entity6 in november and december ahead of february ’s @entity3			1
@entity55 , who averages 52 in domestic one - day cricket for @entity58 , could be the most unlucky casualty of @entity6 ’s inconsistent one - day cricket as he looks sure to miss out despite playing in only one match against @entity27			2
the retention of @entity10 as captain was far less certain in one - day cricket than for the test arena but the vote of confidence from the selectors now is confirmation of their desire for him to lead @entity6 in the @entity3			1
@entity1 ( pictured playing for @entity73 in the @entity74 on wednesday ) will also be included @entity10 will lead @entity6 at next year 's @entity3 in @entity75 and @entity76 @entity36 's form in the 50 - over game has been a source of concern for the @entity6 selectors @entity41 has made the cut despite scoring just three hundreds in 148 one - day internationals @entity10 has his detractors in limited - overs cricket but the fact remains that he has five one - day hundreds , is one of the top 10 runscorers in world 50 - over cricket since the last @entity3 and has a strike - rate as captain comparable to @entity94 ’s			1
he has silenced doubters before and is determined to do so again , as he told @entity96 in an exclusive interview where he said he would be ' devastated ' to miss out now , before almost certainly handing over the one - day reins after the @entity3			2
the difficulties encountered by @entity33 on his step up to 50 - over international cricket against @entity27 , where he was quickly worked out by @entity104 seamers using two new white balls , convinced the selectors that there is still more chance of test - class batsmen in @entity10 and @entity41 scoring centuries than an exciting @entity112 rookie like @entity19			2
there have been more concerns among the selectors about @entity36 ’s form than @entity10 ’s but he made a welcome return to something close to his best in the @entity112 international that finished the international season			0
@entity36 remains a key figure if @entity6 are going to upset the odds and compete for their long overdue first @entity3 title , something they have not come even close to since losing the 1992 final to @entity124 in @entity125			0
@entity6 have under - achieved in limited - overs cricket for much of the 22 years since but they did briefly reach the top of the world one - day standings two years ago and reached the final of last year ’s @entity129 under @entity10 ’s captaincy and using the traditional one - day methods they continue to advocate now			2
that means they will look to the likes of @entity10 , @entity41 and @entity35 to provide the anchor role and try to bat throughout the innings , leaving wickets in hand for @entity36 , @entity1 and @entity37 to explode in the final overs			0
there have been selectorial concerns over the one - dimensional nature of @entity44 but he survives now in a largely unchanged bowling attack because of coach @entity145 preference for a left - armer and with there being few viable alternatives			0
@entity73 ’s @entity149 remains highly - regarded but he has suffered a recurrence of serious back problems this season and is not fit enough to be considered now			0
the @entity153 , which will be based in @entity8 at the same time as the one - day series , will provide @entity19 with one last chance to stake his claim but time is running out for him and other aspirants to gatecrash @entity6 ’s @entity3 party			1
@entity20 's big - hitting @entity19 looks set to miss the cut as @entity6 do n't believe he 's ready for 50 - over cricket			1

@entity10 will lead @entity6 for the one - day series starting in november
big - hitting @entity20 opener @entity19 not given a chance
@entity41 makes the cut with @entity55 set to miss out
