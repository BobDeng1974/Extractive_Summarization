space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction , and even the odd @entity5 movie			0
but one @entity7 scientist is hoping they could , in fact , be the answer to heating our homes in the future			1
however , he has n't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons			0
space lasers : dr @entity19 has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like @entity25 ( pictured ) dr @entity19 , of @entity27 , is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy , the @entity26 reported			1
the satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light			1
the energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth			2
if it works , it could mean solar power could even become viable in @entity7 , or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas			1
the physicist told @entity26 : ' what this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving			2
' initial trials in @entity7 were successful , but dr @entity19 is now hoping to move the trials to @entity54			1
similar ? : @entity56 rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the @entity58 which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in @entity62 orbit ( artist 's illustration shown ) unlike the lasers in the movies , however , they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon , let alone blow up a planet			2
and it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the @entity58 fitted with lasers to clear up ' space junk '			0
the system , suggested by researchers at the @entity77 research institute in @entity56 , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away			0
powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into @entity62 â€™s atmosphere , where it would burn up			0
but this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon : the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size			0
however , dr @entity19 has acknowledged you ' might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control ' of his satellites .			1

dr @entity19 has suggested mirrored satellites to *collect* sunlight
the beams can then be converted into laser light and sent down to earth
the physicist *believes* it could even make solar power feasible in @entity7
but he admits you might need to worry about who is in control of them
