@entity10 , who was 28 when she was shot to death in @entity12 in 2010 , threatened to walk out on him before their ill - fated honeymoon after he told her he regretted their marriage , his murder trial heard			1
the @entity18 engineer sent two scathing late - night messages to bisexual @entity0 , 34 , just a week before her murder following his frank admissions which left her feeling hurt , confused and unable to sleep			1
this is not a joke			2
i ca n't sleep at night ' @entity31 wrote back : ' i love you			2
surely , this is what is the most important thing			0
the rest will just come ' @entity31 's response : the 28 - year - old expresses serious concerns over the state of the marriage ' because we had a bollywood wedding does n't mean we r bollywood actors and just pretending that everything is good when it is n't will just end up with us hating each other , ' the 28 year - old wrote on 5 november 2010			0
in another email , composed in her third language , the @entity18 asked : ' seriously , do you want me to leave you ? its very mean of you to tell me these things that you told me just after marriage then you should have told me this before ! ! ! ' i do n't want an insecure man or a man that feelings does n't ( sic ) come natural that you have to force yourself			0
' never expected things like that from you			0
never expected things like that from you but now i want you to tell me exactly how u feel and honestly , u hurt me a lot by this and iam ready to pack and leave and this is not a joke ! i ca n't even sleep at night			1
' @entity0 , left , is on trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his new wife @entity10 , right , on their honeymoon the correspondence was extracted from @entity0 's phone by police a month after mrs @entity30 was killed in a township carjacking during her @entity12 honeymoon , the @entity85 heard			1
they were read into the record by captain @entity93 whose investigation into the bride 's death concluded that her husband of two weeks was the mastermind of her cold - blooded murder			2
@entity0 's emailed response to his wife 's outpourings was handed to judge @entity102 by defence barrister @entity103			1
in contrast to his wife 's excitable tones , @entity0 's reply was curt , rebutting her concerns in numerical order – number two being the most revealing			1
' when i said it was not natural and was forcing myself – we were talking about not feeling happy			2
not that i was forcing myself to be with you , ' he wrote , nearly four hours after his wife 's two - part screed			0
the accused took copious notes during the testimony of captain @entity93 ' they are very different comments and seriously you can not just take a meaning that you want			0
' you need to listen to what i meant			0
' @entity0 denies recruiting taxi driver @entity126 to organise a fake carjacking as a cover for his wife 's murder at the hands of two gunmen during their trip to @entity134 , exactly four years ago			1
capt @entity93 told the court he had been assigned to investigating mrs @entity30 's murder shortly after her body was discovered , with a fatal gun shot wound to her neck , in the back of @entity126 's taxi			2
he formally interviewed @entity30 48 hours after he and @entity126 had been freed unharmed from the ambush which claimed his wife 's life and it was during that interview that the grieving husband 's story began to unravel			0
basic details from the first - hand account of the carjacking given to police by @entity0 in the hours after the incident were then changed in his later statement , the court heard			1
@entity0 told a new story about the location of the two gun men at the point they confronted the taxi carrying the newylweds , changed the number of guns the men were carrying and what valuables were stolen in the terrifying ordeal			1
in his first account to police , @entity0 had described pleading for his bride 's life in return for the weddings rings he handed over			1
the following morning , he had phoned capt @entity93 to tell him exactly where officers should look for his wife 's £ 25,000 engagement ring - ' in the stitching ' in one of the taxi 's car seats , the court heard			0
the detective said he was'a bit confused because @entity0 told me specifically where to find the ring , after he said [ in his statement ] that he gave the rings to the attackers			1
' after being confronted by the detective with the contradictory versions , @entity0 ' became uneasy with the question and began pacing up and down my office and then gave me that explanation , ' capt @entity93 said			1
the body language between @entity0 and his family was noticeably tense as the policeman gave his testimony - during which @entity0 took copious notes which he passed over the dock to his brother @entity202 , who has sat with the defence team since the start of the trial last month			1
capt @entity93 told the court that by the time @entity126 was in custody , @entity0 had returned to @entity208 but kept in touch with the officer to check on the investigation 's progress			1
during one call to the detective , he learned of @entity126 's arrest			0
@entity217 footage shows @entity0 's reaction to the death of his wife the vehicle where @entity10 's body was found			1
she had been shot in the neck ' the accused was somewhat surprised that i had arrested the taxi driver , ' the detective said			0
the following day , he was contacted by a lawyer , acting for @entity0 , who wanted to know ' whether her client had been implicated in any way			2
' the policeman said that @entity0 had failed to mention a number of vital facts during the hunt for his wife 's killers , which would have entirely changed the direction of their inquiry			2
most significantly , @entity0 had not revealed that he had put @entity241 , 000 ( £ 500 ) in his wife 's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking - or that it was payment for a surprise helicopter ride that he had asked @entity126 to arrange			1
@entity0 did not reveal to police that he had put @entity241 , 000 ( £ 500 ) in his wife 's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking it was only at the opening of his trial , that the helicopter trip was raised for the first time by @entity0 as the cover for the secret meetings , phone calls and text messages between him and @entity126 , and the cash the couple was carrying on the night of his wife 's murder			1
' if that explanation had been given to me , mr @entity126 would automatically have become a suspect , ' capt @entity93 told the court			0
' it would have created a motive for what transpired			0
i did not have any of those facts available			0
' there would have been a motive for @entity126 to have robbed mr @entity0			2
' he dismissed @entity0 's explanation as ' a newly - fabricated story '			2
after the lunch break , during cross-examination mr @entity103 revealed that he had spoken to @entity278 , the lawyer first instructed by @entity0 in the wake of @entity126 's arrest			2
the barrister put it to @entity283 that he had told ms @entity278 outside an earlier hearing dealing with the cases of @entity126 and hit man @entity286 , that mrs @entity30 had been shot in error			2
' she told me that you said they [ hitmen ] did not mean to shoot her			0
they only shot her because she would n't stop screaming , ' mr @entity103 said to the officer , who said he could not recall the exchange			0
mr @entity103 also summed up his client 's contribution to the fiery email exchange as , ' @entity31 says he loves @entity10 ' , referring to bullet point number three of his e-mail			0
surely this is the most important thing			0
the rest will just come , ' it read			0
intriguingly , the two - page print out of the correspondence revealed that it was an innocuous – if impersonal – message from @entity0 , which was obviously followed by a more intimate confession in person - that triggered her fervent reply			1
in a stark list – under the subject : things to get ready – @entity0 offers his wife of five days a list of six items to pack – five of them electronic			1
passports , your laptop , laptop charger , camera , camera charger , camera memory card			0
mr @entity103 told the court : ' the accused will say that they had a discussion when they were in a hotel in @entity334			0
he said how he felt and she did n't like it			0
' @entity0 denies five charges including murder and robbery			1
