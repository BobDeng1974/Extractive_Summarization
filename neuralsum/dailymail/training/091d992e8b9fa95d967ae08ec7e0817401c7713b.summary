a photographer has created a portfolio of incredibly surreal images using a combination of raw materials , original photography and @entity7 alterations			1
@entity8 , originally from @entity9 , claims to capture ' ideas ' in his work			2
whether using photographs and digital editing , or even paint and hand made cardboard models to re-create an imagined vision , his completed images look as though they are perfectly genuine photographs			1
in fact , every new image is a combination of hundreds of original photographs , sometimes with raw materials created by mr @entity8 himself , and dozens of hours spent in @entity7 to digitally alter and combine different elements to illustrate his idea			1
mr @entity8 writes on his website that he uses photography as a means of ' collecting material to realise the ideas in my mind '			1
first the image is sketched as a basic idea			2
he then plans what is required to create the landscape and starts identifying locations to photograph			0
these serve as the basis for the photo , or what he calls the ' raw material '			0
any additional materials needed , such as the cardboard model and paints required for @entity48 are also photographed			0
the final part is putting the photos together			0
this can take him anywhere from a few days to several weeks and he describes it as the easiest step - like putting together the pieces of a puzzle			0

@entity8 has created a portfolio of *stunning* images combining photography , raw materials and digital editing
he takes hundreds of photographs for a single image and pulls them all together using @entity7
the finished pictures show surreal and lifelike scenes which are a mix of fantasy and *authentic* natural landscapes
