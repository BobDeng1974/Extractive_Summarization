host commentator @entity2 are out of the @entity4 after tonight 's defeat			1
with zero points from their opening two games , @entity2 can not progress from the group with @entity55 and @entity56 level on four points and @entity5 now on three			1

would have been a great goal ! @entity38 gets the ball on the edge of the area and attempts to curl the ball into the top corner but scuffs it hopelessly wide			2

former @entity93 man @entity86 , currently with @entity95 giants @entity94 , comes on for @entity7			0

click the above link for the full story			0
the @entity110 frontman was through on goal but @entity32 does enough to put the striker off who shoots wide			0
@entity18 should have done better with that opportunity			0
@entity17 doubles @entity5 's advantage ! the wideman received the ball just on the halfway line and raced towards goal unchallenged before slotting the ball into the far corner			1
great solo effort from @entity17 ! the @entity2 wideman spent last season in the @entity126 second division having signed for @entity127 from @entity128 in 2011			2

@entity37 blazes over just before the referee blows for half - time			0
@entity5 lead and @entity2 are down to ten men			1
can the @entity138 nation turn things around or will @entity141 's men make their numerical advantage count ? @entity143 , silly boy			2

the midfielder could have crossed first time but instead raced goalwards and saw his eventual square ball easily blocked			0
the ball bounces into the box and @entity7 takes a swing of his left foot from a tight angle ... but the ball ends up in row @entity182 looks like the @entity5 left - back felt it was time for a change ... the crowd waited for the net to bulge as @entity17 's effort looked destined for the goal but @entity31 somehow managed to whack it away for a @entity5 throw			1
@entity5 take the lead through the evergreen @entity7			1
the @entity195 frontman had it laid on a plate to him courtesy of @entity17 's tidy square ball and made no mistake in slotting the ball into the corner of the net			2

the @entity2 frontman has just shown off the old @entity204 ( the original , not @entity204 ) stepover to beat his man			0

following @entity56 's stalemate with @entity55 yesterday , defeat for either side will spell elimination .			1

@entity146 scored a tap in to make it four for @entity5
@entity18 goal put the game beyond @entity2 , if it was n't out of reach for the ten men side already
@entity17 scored with a top finish to put @entity5 two nil up and pile further misery on @entity2
@entity11 received a red card for whacking @entity146 in an off the ball *altercation*
@entity7 scored to give his country an early lead
@entity56 defeated @entity5 3 - 1 in @entity4 's opening game
@entity2 also suffered loss in first match , going down 1 - 0 against @entity55
group a clash to be played at @entity281 , the same venue where @entity283 triumphed 2 - 1 over @entity284
losing side in @entity6 would be *dumped* out of @entity4 in group stage
