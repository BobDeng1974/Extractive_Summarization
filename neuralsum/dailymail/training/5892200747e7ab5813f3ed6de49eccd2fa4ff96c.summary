click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100million squad now ... as part of the build - up to the start of @entity8 's @entity7 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity11 with the potential to light up @entity14 's top tier over the coming campaign			2
@entity16 in a nutshell @entity16 arrives at @entity18 with plenty of experience from @entity21 the 26 - year - old made over 150 appearances in @entity25 's top division with @entity26 and current parent club @entity27 - and that should stand him in fine stead to show his ability as a @entity11 wing back			1
@entity32 will deploy the @entity33 on the right of his midfield in his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation , although @entity16 's versatility means he could be pushed further up or into a back four should @entity32 want to mix thing up			0
@entity16 boasts pace down the flank with the ability to whip the ball into the box and he should be a perfect fit at @entity44			0
new in blue ( and red , and black ) : @entity16 poses for a photo at @entity44 after sealing his move getting to grips with the best : @entity16 takes on @entity50 's @entity49 during his time with @entity52 at the @entity53 born : @entity54 , @entity52 , june 12 , 1988 ( age 26 ) position : right wing back / midfielder previous clubs : @entity26 , @entity27 2007 - 2012 : @entity26 ( 127 appearances , 6 goals ) 2012 - : @entity27 ( 29 apps , 0 goal ) @entity53 2014 appearances : 4 tackles won : 6 blocks : 4 recovered balls : 22 @entity68 : 76.9 % stats from @entity70 why you should have @entity72 wing backs look to be a popular option with a lot of @entity11 sides this year - and that offers the perfect option for @entity7 managers looking for more points from their defenders			1
playing out at right wing back should give @entity16 the chance to run up and down that wing and with his crossing ability he will weigh in with a good few assists especially with a poacher like @entity89 to aim for			1
and at just £ 4.1million - why not go for him ? that 's £ 0.6m cheaper than @entity93 's hapless centre back @entity94 ! @entity95 @entity16 was one of @entity52 's many stars that impressed with their brilliant team play at this summer 's @entity53			2
they were unlucky to be beaten on penalties by hosts @entity50 and @entity16 looked pretty good - making his loan signing a bit of a coup for @entity18			1
there 's not just that though - @entity16 has played in the @entity106 with @entity27 too , so he should have no trouble adapting to the testing conditions of the @entity11			2
but how will he pick up points ? @entity112 runs up the flank should provide a fair share of assists for a defender - while @entity16 should be an almost certain starter for the @entity18 , meaning plenty of appearance points			2
you would n't expect someone from a newly promoted side to pick up much in terms of clean sheets but that might be a bit different for @entity18			1
@entity32 knows the league well and with experienced defenders like @entity129 and the quality of @entity131 helping out in defence , there 's still potential for bonuses for @entity7 managers			0
@entity136 touch : @entity16 in action during a @entity106 game with @entity139 for his parent club @entity27 skillful : you can rely on @entity16 to grab some assist points in @entity7 - perfect for any manager do n't just take our word for it @entity32 knows a thing or two about what makes a good @entity11 player - and he seems excited to see @entity16 in action for his newly promoted side			1
' he 's a top player and we 're delighted to have him here , ' @entity32 said			0
' he showed his quality in the @entity53 for @entity52 and it 's a great loan signing for us			0
' ' he ’s a versatile player , he ’s full of energy			0
i ’m confident he ’ll be a really big asset for us this season			0
' @entity32 's words seem to indicate that he would even be happy playing @entity16 further up the field should the @entity18 change formation - great news for @entity7 managers looking to get more out of their defenders			1
energetic : @entity16 will be up and down the flank for @entity18 this season - let 's hope for big points from him !			0
