republicans danced tuesday night to the tune of a new @entity3 majority , but governor 's mansions will also be redder in 2015 than they were this year			1
stunning upsets in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 – three of @entity11 's more liberal - dominated states – left political consultants and commentators shaking their heads			1
the strong @entity16 showing – they won at least six races in states with @entity20 governors – will be seen as a repudiation of @entity22 , who said in october that while he would n't be on the ballot , his policies would be			1
it also will cast doubt on former secretary of state @entity28 's ability to galvanize @entity20 voters in states she would need to win in order to claim the presidency in 2016			1
@entity33 stumped for @entity8 lt. gov. @entity34 in october , carefully controlling events by limiting reporters ' access while playing to half - empty auditoriums			1
@entity34 lost big to political newcomer @entity39 , known in real estate but not in @entity41 , in a 6 - point upset that also brought first lady @entity43 out of @entity44 to buck up @entity34 as his campaign flagged			0
his stock fell tuesday , too , as @entity20 saw him surrendering the keys to the governor 's mansion to a @entity16			1
that sleeper race was one of tuesday 's biggest shockers			2
@entity34 led in nine of the last 10 opinion polls covering the race , slipping behind just days before the election – and then only in a poll commissioned by @entity39 's campaign			2
in june , @entity39 faced a seemingly insurmountable 18 - point deficit			0
five months later , he thanked @entity76 gov. @entity75 , the chairman of the @entity77 , for helping him seal the deal			1
@entity75 , he told wildly cheering supporters , ' was so excited that we had the biggest upset in the entire country , that he wanted to fly his helicopter down here to be with us tonight			2
' he framed his victory as the ' largest mandate for change in @entity8 in 63 years			2
' ' tonight countless @entity20 crossed over , ' he said , ' and affirmed the wisdom of @entity89 who said , " sometimes party loyalty demands too much "			2
' @entity9 @entity16 @entity92 ( left ) won his race despite the state 's liberal - bastion status two - time loser : democrat @entity97 ( right ) crashed and burned for the second time in four years , earning her the nickname ' @entity100 ' in @entity9 , state attorney general @entity97 crashed and burned at the hands of former state cabinet member @entity92 , who won in every county except those in the western part of the state plus @entity106 and the elite playground islands of @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity97 earned the sobriquet ' @entity100 ' after losing a special election in 2010 that was called to fill a @entity3 seat after the death of @entity114			0
that seat had been in @entity20 ' hands for ages , but then - unknown @entity16 @entity117 trounced her			1
@entity34 appeared to have failed in a bid to return to the @entity3 in a @entity120 race on tuesday , in a race he lost by less than one - half of one percent			2
he has not , however , conceded the race			0
that 's one thing he and @entity97 have in common : on tuesday night , trailing by one and one - half percentage points , she sent her supporters home and said she would n't admit she had lost			1
@entity92 trailed all summer in the polls but held a consistent if narrow lead through october			0
@entity75 , the pugnacious @entity76 loudmouth who may fancy himself a presidential contender in just a few short months , also stumped for @entity136 gov. @entity135 , who squeaked by @entity20 former gov. @entity137 by about 1 per cent of the votes cast			1
president @entity22 , too , had a hard night at the polls as @entity11 saw evidence that his 39 per cent approval rating has rendered his coattails too short to grasp			2
@entity144 duck : @entity146 democrat @entity145 failed to end the rule of gov. @entity148 , even though she got some raer in - person help from president @entity22 he personally campaigned for @entity20 challenger @entity145 in @entity146 , only to see her fall to incumbent gov. @entity148 by a 7 - point margin – in a state where every @entity20 incumbent in the @entity156 won another two - year term			1
during an october 28 rally , cameras caught people leaving in droves as the president spoke			0
in @entity22 's adopted home state of @entity7 , incumbent gov. @entity163 lost by 5 points to @entity166			1
he , too , had n't conceded the race by the time @entity166 delivered his victory speech			0
' there are a lot of votes still to be counted , ' @entity163 said			0
' i do n’t believe in throwing in the towel when there are that many votes still to be counted			0
' but @entity166 was romping , crediting his outreach to black pastors – a constituency that helped @entity22 launch his political career – with delivering crucial margins in nearly every county statewide			1
' are you ready for a new direction ? are you ready to bring back @entity7 ? ' he asked a capacity crowd at his victory party			2
' this election is about bringing back our great state			0
this is a victory for our taxpayers who need to have a lower tax burden			0
this is a victory for our workers who deserve to have a booming economy			0
' ' this victory is for our students , our children , who deserve the best schools in @entity11			0
and this is a victory for our citizens who deserve a government without corruption			0
' the win changes the political landscape in @entity7 with an injection of @entity206 for the first time in a dozen years			2
winner : @entity210 attorney general and @entity16 governor - elect @entity211 cruised to victory not her night : an emotional @entity213 ( right ) wiped away her tears after she lost her bid to become governor of @entity210 , as her daughter @entity217 ( left ) looked on in @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 , incumbent @entity20 governors held on in races that were too close to call			1
@entity20 ' only bight spot all night came in @entity224 , as @entity225 gov. @entity225 lost his job to @entity228 @entity227			1
another closely watched race turned into a @entity16 landslide as @entity211 , the paraplegic state attorney general , trounced state sen. @entity213 by 20 points			1
@entity232 is a freshly minted feminist icon known for filibustering an anti-abortion bill in pink sneakers			0
@entity211 had pulled away in recent days , enlarging a 6 - point lead to an 18 - point spread in the last two weeks – since @entity232 ran a controversial tv ad making a wheelchair the center of attention			1
he won big on tuesday , despite reports that his name never appeared on touch - screen voting machines in at least one polling place			0
in her concession speech , @entity232 told her supporters to be disappointed , but not discouraged			0
accusations surfaced tuesday afternoon that in the @entity210 's third-most populous county , @entity211 's name is n't on at least one touch - screen ballot machine			1
instead , an @entity255 photo of a @entity257 machine shows , the @entity16 slot is taken by @entity258 , the 2012 failed @entity16 candidate for lieutenant governor			2
an alert @entity257 , @entity210 voter snapped this picture of a voting machine that omitted the name of @entity16 gubernatorial candidate @entity211 , substituting 2012 failed lieutenant governor hopeful @entity258 instead gov. @entity148 has attracted scorn and tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from angry labor unions , but still could not be stopped big surrogate : @entity76 gov. @entity75 ( front ) stumped last week for @entity8 @entity16 gubernatorial hopeful @entity39 in a race that 's now too close to call @entity272 , communications director at the conservative @entity274 organization , told @entity275 that his group had confirmed @entity257 has received ' additional complaints ' and that ' they are currently investigating how widespread the matter is			1
' ' i think it 's a photoshopped deal but we are checking , ' @entity257 elections administrator @entity279 told the @entity283			0
the image , which shows clunky block - like sections of the video template out of place , could reflect a ham - fisted @entity289 attempt , a @entity16 campaign consultant in @entity291 told @entity275			2
' or , ' he said , ' it could be that the voting machine 's software is messed up			0
if it 's pulling in candidates from two years ago , who knows what else is wrong in those computers ? ' the campaign operative insisted , though , that @entity211 would win tuesday			1
' not even the @entity20 could buy enough votes or stuff enough ballot boxes to save @entity213 at this point , ' he said			1
@entity306 reporter @entity305 posted the @entity255 photo after she interviewed the woman who snapped it			0
it 's unclear how that voter could have edited the image so fast , and without leaving the polling place			0
' i do n't have time for that , ' the woman told her			0
@entity305 posted a second photo on @entity320 , showing the same kind of digital goof .			0

*massive* power shifts came tuesday in liberal - dominated @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity9 as @entity16 sent @entity20 packing
