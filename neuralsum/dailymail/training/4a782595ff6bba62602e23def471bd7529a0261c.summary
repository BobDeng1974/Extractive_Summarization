by @entity0 last updated at 11:54 am on 21st july 2011 convicted : student @entity1 , pictured here with a male companion , who ran up thousands of pounds of bills on her mother 's credit cards she stole tens of thousands of pounds from her mother to fund lavish spending sprees and foreign holidays			1
not content with that , @entity1 then targeted her elderly grandmother			1
but incredibly , the student still has her mother 's support - although her pleas for leniency fell on deaf ears yesterday			1
a judge jailed @entity19 , 26 , for nine months and said : ' it was the ultimate betrayal of a family			1
' he rejected a claim by @entity19 , a single mother of a seven - month - old boy , that she committed the crimes over five years to punish mother @entity27 for keeping her in the dark when her father @entity29 was dying of leukaemia in 2000			1
her thefts totalled £ 38,000 - but she was thwarted in an attempt to gain £ 360,000 more by remortgaging the family home			1
the court heard that @entity19 was a talented student who won a place to study at @entity38 @entity37			1
but she began using her mother ’s @entity41 bank card and credit card and @entity45 ’s store card without permission , and flew to @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
she also used her mother ’s identity and funds for three holidays at @entity55 , trips on @entity58 ferries , stays in hotels , clothes and restaurant meals			2
her tally on ten cards in her mother ’s name reached £ 26,000 , including £ 3,000 on phone bills , £ 3,000 on clothes and more on sofas , cosmetics and tickets to comedy shows			2
astonishingly , for four years , her mother blamed herself and paid off the debts without taking further action			2
last year , she reached the end of her tether and called the police – but she dropped the charges after her daughter promised to change			2
within months , however , the fraudster turned to stealing from her grandmother , @entity81 , who lived in @entity82 , @entity83			1
cash cow : @entity1 tried to remortgage her mother @entity27 's house ( pictured ) in @entity86 , @entity83 by the time the elderly mrs @entity1 found out , her granddaughter had run up bills of £ 12,000 in her name			1
mrs @entity1 died within a week of discovering the betrayal			1
the student was also caught plotting to forge signatures so she could remortgage her mother ’s home and raise more cash			2
delusional : @entity1 told her mother she had graduated from @entity38 's @entity37 ( pictured ) with a first , but she had n't even finished her degree the court also heard that @entity19 falsely told her mother she had graduated from her university with a first class degree , when she had not even completed her course			1
but despite all this , her mother sent a letter to @entity104 to try to save her from jail after she pleaded guilty to 12 counts of fraud and asked for a further 150 to be taken into consideration			0
the mother , 60 , of @entity86 in @entity83 , wrote : ‘ i want to beg you to show her mercy by not giving her a custodial sentence			0
i have forgiven her for her actions			0
‘ i feel they were a result of my husband ’s death			0
she struggled to cope with the loss of a much - loved father			0
she realises she has ruined her life			0
’ but judge @entity121 told a weeping @entity19 , of @entity122 , @entity83 : ‘ over five years , you acted in a determined and deliberate way			0
‘ it was utterly despicable			0
you have been given chance after chance by your mother			0
‘ you threw it back in her face after she declined to continue with the police investigation and turned your attention to your grandmother , which was almost unimaginable			0
‘ i do not accept it was all down to the loss of your father			0
no doubt you were extremely upset , but this was determined dishonesty			0
’ lavish : a flight to @entity49 ( pictured ) was among @entity1 's fraudulent purchases			1

@entity1 , 26 , jailed for nine months after lavish spending spree
