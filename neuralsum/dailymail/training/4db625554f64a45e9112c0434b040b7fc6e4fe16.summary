by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:26 am on 11th november 2011 a senior @entity3 journalist arrested over the phone hacking scandal claimed yesterday he had made secret recordings of his bosses			1
@entity7 , ex-chief reporter for the sunday tabloid who is currently on police bail , claims to have compiled a large dossier of taped conversations and memos , which is now with his lawyers and proves phone hacking was ingrained in the culture of the paper			1
mr @entity7 also cast doubt on @entity20 's insistence to the culture select committee that he was never told the full extent of illegal voicemail interceptions at the @entity3			1
phone - hacking suspect @entity7 , the former @entity3 chief reporter , claims he was offered immunity in return for evidence that could potentially implicate ex-news editor @entity29 , right he claims the @entity31 executive chairman was shown the crucial ' for @entity7 ' email , which first made clear that journalists other than royal editor @entity34 , jailed in 2007 , were engaged in criminal activity			1
yesterday mp @entity36 told the @entity37 that he had met with mr @entity7 , and that he – like mr @entity20 – insists that he was never shown the ' for @entity7 ' e-mail , even though it bears his name and was apparently meant to be forwarded to him			2
it emerged during a legal action taken against the paper by @entity44 chief @entity43			0
mr @entity7 claims he pleaded with @entity31 's former legal manager @entity45 not to show it to mr @entity20 because he feared he would lose his job as a result			1
more questions : news international executive chairman @entity20 gives evidence to the @entity52 inquiry into phone hacking today detectives have been deluged with 300million emails handed over by @entity31			1
the extraordinary amount of evidence was revealed as an outside police force recommended more officers be drafted in			2
initially the @entity62 team began with 45 detectives , there are now 118 working on the hacking inquiry and two associated investigations , at a cost of £ 3million in salaries alone			0
@entity68 has arrested 17 people so far over the scandal			0
but he says he could not persuade him , and a week later mr @entity45 allegedly confirmed to mr @entity7 that he had shown it to his boss			2
this would appear to contradict mr @entity20 's testimony that he was never shown the e-mail			0
the evidence seized from mr @entity7 's home by police is thought to include a recording of a conversation between him and @entity83 , the junior @entity84 journalist who sent the e-mail			1
in the tape @entity83 is alleged to blame a senior @entity84 executive for commissioning the hacking of mr @entity43			0
mr @entity7 , 50 , has lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against @entity31			1
among the large batch of recordings and memos which are with his lawyers , one tape is said to be of a @entity84 executive agreeing that mr @entity7 had nothing to do with the hacking of mr @entity43			2
it is understood that @entity7 tried to offer the tape to very senior @entity84 executives in april this year in a bid to prove his innocence			1
however , they were said to have been ' very angry ' that the paper 's chief reporter was conducting his own inquiries , refused to collect the recording and told him to keep quiet			2
the revelation that mr @entity43 had been targeted dispelled @entity31 's claims that phone - hacking was limited to rogue @entity34 reporter @entity34 , who was jailed over the affair			1
mr @entity7 denied commissioning the voice - mail interception and it is believed that a recording and a memo that were found at his home may go some way to clear his name			1
the memo to the paper 's former editor , @entity122 , and the former head of legal , @entity45 , is said to name other senior executives			1
it is claimed that the message was sent in july 2009 before @entity127 was told that hacking was restricted to a rogue reporter			0
after his arrest mr @entity7 claims to have been offered potential immunity from prosecution if he would testify against former colleagues			2
he refused because he thinks he will be exonerated			0
pressure : the paper 's former editor @entity122 , left , and @entity31 head of legal affairs @entity45 , right , give evidence to mps close : @entity140 chairman @entity139 , left , and former news international chief executive @entity141 , right , who have also been questioned over the scandal police allegedly made the approach after previous suggestions that @entity7 had passed information on crime to the police			1
court reports revealed mr @entity7 was charged with corruption over his relationship with a @entity153 detective			0
but the men were acquitted in july 2000 and mr @entity7 later said that the information he provided to police was applauded by the judge			2
police have refused to discuss the role of informants			0
the apparent move suggests that police are still gathering evidence in the investigation which could run for many more months			0
mr @entity7 , who has always insisted that he is innocent , said that he declined the offer			0
he told the @entity165 that he believed he would eventually be cleared			0
he said : ' i have informed @entity68 that while i fully understand and respect the reason for their request of me to give evidence for the @entity172 in any prosecution arising from @entity62 , it is my opinion that a detailed and forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly professional police unit will fully exonerate me			0
so ... i have declined their offer			0
' the latest evidence is believed to have emerged after officers from the @entity183 raided mr @entity7 's home earlier this year .			1

police ' found memo and secret recordings ' at @entity7 's home
evidence points the *finger* at senior @entity31 executives
@entity7 ' conducted his own clandestine operation to clear his name '
reporter was a ' police informant ' while covering crime stories
