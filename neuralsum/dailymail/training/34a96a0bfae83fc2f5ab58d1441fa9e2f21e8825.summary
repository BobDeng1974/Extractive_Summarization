the biggest surprise about @entity2 general secretary @entity1 leaving after 11 years with @entity5 football ’s ruling body is that no scandal or controversy accompanies his departure			1
@entity1 ’s four predecessors - @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - either walked out ( in @entity10 ’s case after just nine months ) or were forced out			1
however @entity1 , 42 , appears to be leaving his £ 580,000 - a - year post at the end of january for the reason he gave in his statement on tuesday : ‘ the time is right for me to look for a change of direction			1
’ @entity1 has left his post as @entity2 general secretary after 11 years with @entity5 football 's ruling body with a @entity26 background , he will be able to match or better his @entity2 salary , which made him the best - paid chief of any @entity30 sports governing body			1
and his cv , that includes the opening of @entity33 and @entity34 , winning the @entity37 2022 final and steering a very turbulent organisation into calmer waters , looks good			1
but there is conjecture outside @entity33 that @entity2 chairman @entity40 is looking to reform the management as one of his strategic initiatives after the @entity44 and @entity1 might have decided that this is the right time for a parting of the ways			1
@entity1 , a methodical and organised executive , would have found @entity40 , who shoots from the hip and tends to make up his mind on the hoof , a more difficult chairman to work with than his predecessor @entity52			1
@entity1 's reign has included the opening of @entity33 and @entity44 winning the right to host the @entity37 final the @entity57 are only just starting to look for a new chairman six months after @entity26 stalwart @entity59 suffered the stroke that forced him to quit			1
the @entity57 ’s audit and remuneration committee have taken their time because of complications with @entity59 ’s lawyers and his family and they waited for chief executive @entity67 to fully recover from heart surgery in the summer			2
@entity44 rugby head coach @entity69 has commissioned a video promoting @entity44 pride ahead of the @entity72 which features patriotic englishmen @entity73 and @entity75			2
but @entity69 is keeping the film , inspired by the way @entity78 and @entity79 utilise their national togetherness , in - house until after the @entity82			2
he told a business audience in @entity84 he does n’t want any political ramifications over stressing @entity5 identity during a tournament involving all the home nations			2
@entity44 head coach @entity69 has commissioned a video to help raise pride within his squad the upheaval at @entity93 has been such that the three senior executives - @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 - were escorted off the premises by security before starting suspensions on full pay from which they are not expected to return			0
the @entity102 , who own the circuit , are conducting a root and branch investigation into a loss - making operation led by @entity102 director @entity109 , care home tycoon and a government business advisor , who has big motorsport interests			0
it 's been a nightmare fortnight for publishers with @entity118 ’s updated paperback edition of sir @entity120 ’s autobiography being made public on tuesday before wednesday ’s supposedly orchestrated release			2
this closely follows @entity125 ’s @entity124 book being sold by @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 before the publication date			0
the @entity118 inquiry should start at @entity131 in @entity132			0
meanwhile , the four - day sports - writing festival at @entity134 ’s this week is a highly admirable initiative			0
but it ’s bizarre that former rugby hooker @entity139 ’s obscene book , what goes on tour stays on tour , that contains lyrics of rugby songs sure to offend many readers , has been given a prime promotional spot on thursday night			0
@entity124 poses with his autobiography , which was released by @entity126 in @entity127 before the publication date following talks between sport , government and funding agencies , basketball is expected to receive the money in the next fortnight that will allow the @entity30 women ’s team to compete in the @entity158			0
@entity160 ’s zero tolerance towards sports with no medal potential in @entity163 brought about basketball ’s cash problems			0
a @entity160 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are in discussions with the @entity169 and @entity44 regarding what support can be offered to sports that fall outside our investment criteria			0

@entity1 will step down as @entity2 general secretary in january
@entity1 's reign includes the opening of @entity33 and @entity34 as well as winning the bid to host @entity37 final
his four predecessors either walked out or were forced out
there is conjecture outside @entity33 that @entity2 chairman @entity40 is looking to reform the management of the @entity2
