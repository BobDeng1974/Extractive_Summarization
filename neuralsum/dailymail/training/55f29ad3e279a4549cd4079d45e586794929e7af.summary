by @entity0 published : 23:46 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 18 june 2013 supermarket bread contains 20 per cent less salt than it did a decade ago , according to new research			1
some of the most popular branded products also trail supermarket 's own packaged loaves , with less than half meeting @entity8 guidelines on what is a healthy amount			1
and a group of scientists behind a new study insist that more work needs to be done to drive down the amount of salt in our bread and help lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes			2
health boost : supermarket own brand breads contain 20 per cent less salt than they did a decade ago , according to new research bread is the biggest contributor of dietary salt in the @entity28 , providing almost a fifth of the total derived from processed foods			1
the recommended daily intake for @entity28 adults is a maximum of 6g , compared with the current average of 8.1g a day			0
@entity37 levels in packaged bread in supermarkets across the @entity28 fell around a fifth from 1.23g per 100g in 2001 , to 0.98g per 100g in 2011 , according to findings published in the online journal @entity43			0
researchers examined 40 products in 2001 , and 203 in 2011 for the study by the @entity47 in @entity48			0
overall , the number of products meeting the @entity52 's 2012 target - of less than or equal to 1g of salt per 100g - rose from under a third in 2001 to almost three - quarters in 2011			2
guilty pleasure : bread is the biggest single contributor of salt to the @entity28 diet accounting for almost a fifth of the total from processed foods but wide variations in salt content persist between supermarket own - label and branded products , the results showed			1
in 2001 , 38 per cent of supermarket own - label loaves met the 2012 target compared with just 17 per cent of branded products			1
by 2011 , the equivalent figures were 89 per cent and 42 per cent respectively			0
little difference in salt content was found between white , wholemeal , and brown loaves despite the common perception that wholemeal and brown bread are healthier alternatives to white bread			2
the scientists behind the research said : ' a wide variation in salt levels was found , with many products already meeting the 2012 targets , indicating that further reductions can be made			0
' this requires further progressive lower targets to be set , so that the @entity28 can continue to lead the world in salt reduction and save the maximum number of lives			0
' professor @entity91 , chairman of @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity47 , said : ' a reduction in population salt intake is one of the most cost - effective measures to improve public health , as lowering salt intake lowers blood pressure and reduces the number of people suffering and dying from strokes , heart attacks and heart failure			1
' a @entity52 spokesman said : ' too much salt can lead to high blood pressure , heart disease and stroke			0
' so we are really pleased that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of salt in bread and are continuing to work with industry , through ' he @entity119 , to help people reduce their salt intake			1
' many foods contain higher levels of salt than we might expect so it 's important to check the label			2
' to make it easy for everyone to keep track of what they eat and make healthier choices , we will soon be announcing a simple and clear system for front - of - pack labelling that everyone can use to help people make healthier choices			0

almost *90* per cent of supermarket loaves meet @entity8 ' healthy ' target
that figure is less than 50 per cent when it comes to branded bread
bread accounts for a fifth of our salt intake from processed foods
