fine margins and good fortune allowed @entity2 to claim a quarter - final place on sunday afternoon			1
after the scorching demolition of @entity6 a week earlier , this was a victory for the earthy virtue of pack power			1
the home side had come into this contest at @entity11 determined to reach the knock - out stages and also avenge the 37 - 10 drubbing they were subjected to in the reverse fixture back in october			1
ultimately , they achieved both objectives , but despite finishing top of @entity20 , this was not a statement of intent that will reverberate around the @entity24 game			1
@entity2 wing @entity25 ( centre ) runs at the @entity29 defence during his side 's 20 - 15 win on sunday @entity32 of @entity2 is tackled by @entity29 pair @entity33 and @entity34 at the @entity11 @entity2 : @entity32 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 , 6 ; @entity39 , 71 ) , @entity25 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 , 66 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 , 63 ) ; @entity43 ( @entity44 , 50 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 , 50 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 , 50 ) ; @entity49 ( capt ) , day ( @entity51 , 56 ) ; @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 , 63 ) , @entity55			1

@entity29 : @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 , 46 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 , 63 ) ; @entity34 , @entity68 ( @entity69 , 70 ) ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity73 , 41 ) ; @entity74 , @entity75 ( capt ) ; @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79			2
tries : @entity64 , @entity78			0
referee : @entity83 ( @entity84 )			0
att : 13,349 two penalty tries were a testament to @entity2 ’s dominance in scrum and maul , but in most aspects of the game they were emphatically out - played by their @entity93 opponents in this qualification decider			1
@entity29 ’s ambition and open - field cohesion had already delivered two tries – one a long - range classic – and they so nearly snatched a third to secure a draw or win at the death			0
in the last minute , @entity101 full back @entity33 – an outstanding , threatening runner throughout – surged towards the left corner			0
he seemed certain to score but was stopped short of the line			0
the danger was not averted though and @entity71 lunged to touch the ball down but fumbled at agonisingly close - range			0
seconds later , @entity2 ’s players celebrated the tense result , without knowing the wider implications			1
news soon filtered through from @entity112 that @entity6 , who had led the pool going into this final pool weekend , had been beaten by a single point at @entity117 , which meant that @entity59 ’s men had nipped in front of them to claim an automatic last - eight place			1
seven days after running riot against one of the continent ’s superpower clubs , this was an occasion far removed from that thrilling spectacle			0
@entity2 turned the screw in the scrum ; led by their @entity130 prop pair – @entity47 and @entity43			1
but they were only actually in front for 19 minutes of this disjointed contest , which tells a tale of their struggle to impose themselves on rivals who appeared vulnerable due to the absence of several key players			0
@entity2 's players including @entity38 ( centre ) and @entity51 ( right ) applaud their fans after the game @entity2 forward @entity52 ( centre ) breaks free with the ball during their @entity150 clash it did n’t help @entity2 ’s cause that they lost influential @entity155 centre @entity153 to an injury early on , while his midfield partner , @entity36 – the hero of @entity6 – had limited opportunities to provide repeat fireworks and was largely contained			1
so the thrills and spills of round five gave way to dogged , primal force , to become the first team to win a pool after losing their first two games			1
‘ last week you saw the dash , this week you saw the grunt , ’ said director of rugby @entity59 – to neatly encapsulate the contrast			1
‘ i ’m pleased that when we were n’t playing our “ a ” game , we still found a way to win			0
it came down to small margins – they were attacking our line at the end but we came out on the right side of it			2
‘ we lost our first two games in october , so to end up as pool winners is brilliant			2
this club wants to play in the big games			2
a quarter - final of the @entity150 will be a huge game and a huge step , it will be great for us			0
’ @entity29 deservedly went ahead in the fifth minute as @entity191 burst through @entity41 ’s attempted tackle and released impressive @entity193 centre @entity64 , who raced clear to score			0
@entity34 converted and later – after half - time – the fly - half set the wheels in motion for the visitors ’ scintillating second try			0
@entity29 star @entity33 attempts to run clear of @entity2 's defence during a tense clash on sunday afternoon @entity29 's @entity74 appears dejected after the final whistle at the @entity11 in @entity2 from turn - over ball in his own half , the @entity203 10 stormed over halfway on the right and sent @entity63 away into space			1
after @entity208 maintained the momentum , @entity63 ran on and passed out for @entity210 to round off a devastating counter-attack			0
but for all their slick attacking , the @entity93 side were undermined by their struggles up front			2
in the 52nd minute , @entity2 only had two @entity217 penalties to show for their faltering efforts , but then a penalty to the left corner brought the hosts their first try			1
captain @entity49 won the lineout , the home pack drove for the line and when the maul went down , a penalty try was awarded , which @entity39 converted			0
@entity29 were soon back in front courtesy of a @entity34 penalty , but in the 66th minute @entity2 ’s forwards delivered another decisive show of force			2
@entity32 had just squandered a clear scoring chance in the right corner – where he was superbly held up by @entity34 – but the subsequent scrum was another one - sided rout which yielded another penalty try for the @entity238			0
@entity38 added the conversion to give @entity2 a five - point advantage but at the end they were hanging on			1
@entity55 claimed one last turn - over to quell the @entity29 resistance and leave their head coach , @entity244 , to lament the so - near - but - so - far outcome			0
‘ we came up two inches short , ’ he said			0
@entity51 celebrates a decisive try scored by @entity247 as @entity2 reached the quarter - finals of the competition			2
