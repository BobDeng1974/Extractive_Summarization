sisters @entity0 and @entity2 have both been given breast enhancements - by their plastic surgeon father			1
the girls , from fashionable @entity6 in @entity7 , are walking advertisements for their famous plastic surgeon parent , dr @entity9			0
@entity2 , 25 , first had breast surgery as a gift for her 18th birthday when she went from an a cup to @entity14 three years later @entity9 gave her a rhinoplasty for her 21st birthday , when he narrowed the bridge of her nose			1
this year she also opted for a breast augmentation to take her from @entity31 to @entity32 - and did n't have to look far for a surgeon			1
charm , also 25 , who works in marketing said : ' having surgery done by my dad makes sense - he 's the best at what he does and i know i 'm in safe hands			1
growing up in @entity6 and seeing so many people having surgery , it never seemed like a big deal to me			1
' out here cosmetic surgery is a normal part of everyday life			1
since i had my boob job all my friends tell me that i look great			0
' ' i did n't want to go too big and i think this is my perfect size			0
you might not even know i 'd had them done if you did n't know me			0
' both women regularly have facial peels and @entity57 at their dad 's clinic , @entity58 and @entity60 , to reduce the chances of wrinkles			1
cosmetic surgeon dr @entity9 injecting his adopted daughter charm in the forehead - both sisters , aged 25 , regularly have @entity57 , which he administers himself the sisters ( @entity0 , left , @entity2 , right ) , who were adopted by @entity9 and wife @entity67 as babies , have attracted criticism about their decision to cosmetically alter their appearance @entity0 said : ' every other month i 'll get something done to my skin			1
' ' i think @entity57 is important because it prevents you from getting wrinkles			1
i also get @entity57 in my armpits , which helps me stop sweating			1
' unsurprisingly the sisters , who were adopted by @entity9 and wife @entity67 as babies , have attracted criticism about their decision to cosmetically alter their appearance			0
however , the girls say they have valid reasons for making the most of their dad 's skills			0
@entity2 , a make - up artist , said : ' i was totally flat chested so i just wanted to feel more comfortable in my own skin			1
' when i first told my parents i wanted my breasts done i was about 15			0
i knew i had to wait until i was 18 but i was nagging them about it all the time			0
' when i graduated high school @entity91 surprised me by saying , " i 've scheduled you in to have your boobs done next week "			0
mother @entity67 was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance the pair act as ambassadors for their dad 's work , and say more and more young women are approaching their father @entity9 for cosmetic work ' it 's the best thing i 've ever done			1
i love my boobs now - they 're perfect			1
' but for some people having an intimate cosmetic produce done by their dad is a little too close to home			0
' when @entity2 first told me she wanted to get implants i i fought it for a long time			1
but she was so insistent that eventually i said " okay show me your breasts "			0
then i could see why she wanted implants ' @entity2 said : ' some people say , " is n't it weird that your dad has seen your breasts ? " and i say no. ' first of all i 'm his daughter and he 's seen me naked when i was a baby , so really who cares ? ' ' secondly , he sees thousands of boobs a year so a boob to him is just an object like a pen			1
it 's just what he does			0
' and as ambassadors for their dad 's work , more and more young women are approaching @entity9 for cosmetic work			0
@entity0 said : ' almost all of our friends have had procedures done by my dad , whether that 's boob jobs , liposuction , @entity57 or skin peels			1
@entity146 dr @entity9 with his daughters @entity2 ( right ) and @entity0 ( left ) at his practice			1
he admits : ' there are people that would critique me for doing a breast augmentation on my daughter at 18 ' @entity146 dr @entity9 injecting his adopted daughter @entity2 in the forehead			1
@entity2 , 25 , first had breast surgery for her 18th birthday and three years later got a new nose for her 21st birthday ' if there are ten people in a room , nine out of the ten people have had something done by my dad			1
' @entity167 people even will find me on @entity168 and will say , " oh are you dr. @entity9 's daughter ? i was thinking about getting this procedure done , can you help me ? "			0
' i give their information to a consultant			0
it 's a family business so i 'm contributing and so it 's good			0
' however , not everyone was thrilled with the pair 's enthusiasm for a quick fix			0
@entity67 was initially opposed to her daughters going under the knife to alter their appearance			0
she said : " when @entity2 first told me she wanted to get implants i i fought it for a long time			1
i said , " no we 're not doing this , this is not right "			0
' but she was so insistent that eventually i said " okay show me your breasts "			0
' then i could see why she wanted implants and realised it would be beneficial for her to get her breasts enlarged , so i agreed			0
@entity146 dr @entity9 ( centre left ) with his adopted daughters @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) , and his wife @entity67 ( centre right ) , at his practice @entity7 ' now i can see she 's so much more confident and i think she looks great			1
' but when @entity2 again turned to surgery a few years later to change her nose , @entity67 worried it was going to be a reoccurring trend			1
@entity67 explained : ' i did n't want them to think they could just turn to surgery every time they did n't like something about their appearance			2
' and i worried that with it being so readily available they could become addicted to plastic surgery			2
' i told @entity2 she was beautiful the way she was - we always try to stress , beauty is within			1
' i fought it for a long time but when i saw how much she hated her nose , i gave in again			2
' last month @entity0 decided to have a breast augmentation after exercise had reduced the volume of her chest			1
she said : ' i work out like a fanatic and i noticed my breasts got a lot smaller and i lost a lot of the volume in them			0
' @entity91 would n't do the surgery unless i convinced my mum , so when i convinced her i had to sit her down a couple of different times and really tell her that i was serious about it			2
' despite continued criticism of their decision to have surgery , the sisters remain defiant			2
@entity0 says : ' because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad i realise people can be pretty ignorant ' now the sisters turn heads everywhere they go and are constantly recommending impressed women to their dad 's clinic			1
@entity0 said : ' i went out to a restaurant the other night and started talking about the procedures and everything			1
' my waiter actually wanted to come in to get @entity57 , so i took down her number and i booked her appointment to come in			1
charm breast enhancement @entity57 ( face and armpits ) tummy button tuck @entity260 breast enhancement @entity57 rhinoplasty ' in @entity6 you are judged on your looks			1
there 's just so much pressure on everyone to look perfect ' if you go or a job interview in the beauty industry , obviously the person who is better looking is going to get the job - that 's just how it is here			2
' but despite the continued criticism of their decision to have surgery , the sisters remain defiant			2
@entity0 said : ' because of the criticism we have had for getting surgery done by our dad i realise people can be pretty ignorant			1
' people should understand that we got procedures done because we did n't feel good about ourselves			0
' and @entity9 ca n't deny that his daughters polished appearance is good for business			0
he said : ' there are people that would critique me for doing a breast augmentation on my daughter at 18			2
' but i 've been doing surgery for 30 years and i wanted the best of care , which i feel i can deliver to my daughter			2
' nobody , nobody would treat my daughter the way i would			0
' i do n't think i influenced my daughters personally to have surgery , because we discourage it			2
' but they have grown up in an environment of beauty			0
our cars are always immaculate , our house is immaculate and all our friends are beautiful			0
' you could say they were influenced by that environment			0
they understand the importance of looking and maintaining your beauty the rest of their lives ' i felt very , very comfortable doing her surgery			2
and i would do it over again			0
' the plastic surgical industry today is a thousand fold compared to when i first started			0
' before it was very hush - hush but these days people are having it and talking about it			2
' people will come from all around the world to the @entity330 to have cosmetic surgery			2
' ' you go to @entity333 , you go to @entity334 , i 'll be you 50 per cent of the population have cosmetic surgery			2
