a huge wasps nest measuring about 10 feet long has been found in a camper , in @entity2			1
@entity3 of @entity4 in the sleepy town of @entity6 , had no idea there was a nest in the fold - down camper in his storage yard until he lifted it with a forklift			1
incredibly he was n't stung as he sat perfectly still for 20 minutes and waited for pest control to arrive			2
the nest is believed to have been one of the largest ever cleared in @entity2			1
' i was virtually inside the nest , ' he said			1
' it was very hot , stuffy			2
it was like crawling through a bunch of cushions , and you could feel them buzzing against the bee suit ' , he told the @entity37			2
the singing truth : yellow jackets or wasps are capable of stinging multiple times ... and it hurts ! @entity22 managed to keep his cool as he removed 37 queens , by hand			1
he refused to use pesticides despite the advice of a number of colleagues in the bee extraction business to simply burn the thing out			0
' @entity52 vacuum and grabbing bags , ' he said , literally tearing loose pieces of the comb and stuffing them into trash bags			0
' quite an adrenalin rush			0
' he was stung a half - dozen times , but in a two - decade career extracting hives and nests , he figures he 's been stung more than 6,000 times			0
yellow jacket nests are occasionally very large			0
known as the ' lightweight ' bee , they are casually brushed away by people who would be more circumspect around a honey bee , wasp or hornet however they do sting and are capable of multiple stings with their venom carrying quite the kick			0
a trash can - sized nest found in @entity77 in the 1990s was estimated to have 250,000 worker bees			1

the nest is one of the largest ever found in @entity2
it contained 37 queen wasps which were removed by hand
*driver* was forced to wait in the *vehicle* without moving for fear of *disrupting* the *insects*
