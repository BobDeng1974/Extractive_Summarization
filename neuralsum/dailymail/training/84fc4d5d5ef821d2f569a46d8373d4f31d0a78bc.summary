@entity1 president @entity0 demanded on wednesday that the @entity2 return the @entity2 base at @entity4 , lift the half - century trade embargo on @entity1 and compensate his country for damages before the two nations re-establish normal relations			1
@entity0 told a summit of the @entity11 that @entity1 and the @entity2 are working toward full diplomatic relations but ' if these problems are n't resolved , this diplomatic rapprochement would n't make any sense			1
' no way , the @entity16 said thursday			0
the president 's spokesman affirmed that @entity20 ' does believe that the prison at @entity4 should be closed down			1
' but the naval base is not something we 're interested in closing , ' he clarified			2
@entity1 's president @entity0 demanded that the @entity2 return the @entity2 base at @entity4 , lift the half - century trade embargo on @entity1 and compensate his country for damages before the two nations re-establish normal relations @entity0 and @entity2 president @entity20 announced on december 17 that they would move toward renewing full diplomatic relations by reopening embassies in each other 's countries			1
the two governments held negotiations in @entity36 last week to discuss both the reopening of the embassies and the broader agenda of re-establishing normal relations			2
@entity20 has loosened the trade embargo with a range of measures designed to increase economic ties with @entity1 and increase the number of @entity1 who do n't depend on the communist state for their livelihoods			1
the @entity20 administration says removing barriers to @entity2 travel , remittances and exports to @entity1 is a tactical change that supports the @entity2 ' unaltered goal of reforming @entity1 's single - party political system and centrally planned economy			2
retired @entity1 leader @entity57 released a statement , dated this week , saying that he does n't trust @entity2 policy , but that he does n't reject peaceful solutions to conflicts @entity1 has said it welcomes the measures but has no intention of changing its system			0
without establishing specific conditions , @entity0 's government has increasingly linked the negotiations with the @entity2 to a set of longstanding demands that include an end to @entity2 support for @entity1 dissidents and @entity1 's removal from the @entity2 list of state sponsors of terrorism			2
on wednesday , @entity0 emphasized an even broader list of @entity1 demands , saying that while diplomatic ties may be re-established , normal relations with the @entity2 depend on a series of concessions that appear highly unlikely in the near future			1
the @entity2 established the military base in 1903 , and the current @entity1 government has been demanding the land 's return since the 1959 revolution that brought it to power			0
@entity1 also wants the @entity2 to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for losses caused by the embargo			0
' the re-establishment of diplomatic relations is the start of a process of normalizing bilateral relations , but this will not be possible while the blockade still exists , while they do n't give back the territory illegally occupied by the @entity4 naval base , ' @entity0 said			1
he demanded that the @entity2 end the transmission of @entity107 radio and television broadcasts and deliver ' just compensation to our people for the human and economic damage that they 're suffered			0
' the @entity113 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on @entity0 's remarks			0
the @entity16 confirmed on thursday that returning @entity4 was not a subject of past discussions			0
@entity2 moves to restore diplomatic relations with @entity1 and loosen the five - decade trade embargo have ' the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere ' and have ' added up to new hope for the future in @entity1 , ' @entity20 said in his @entity129 address @entity0 's call for an end to the @entity2 embargo drew support at the summit from the presidents of @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity136 president @entity141 also praised the effort by the leaders of @entity1 and the @entity2 to improve relations			2
' the two heads of state deserve our recognition for the decision they made â€” beneficial for @entity1 and @entity2 , but , most of all , for the entire continent , ' she said			0
@entity151 , who led the @entity152 in @entity36 until last year , said that the tone of @entity1 's recent remarks did n't mean it would be harder than expected to reach a deal on short - term goals like reopening full embassies in @entity36 and @entity158			1
in fact , he said , the comments by @entity0 and high - ranking diplomats may indicate the pressure @entity1 's government is feeling to strike a deal as @entity1 ' hopes for better living conditions rise in the wake of @entity20 's outreach			1
' there is this huge expectation of change and this expectation has been set off by the president 's announcement , ' @entity151 said			0
the @entity1 government feels ' the constant need to tell their people nothing 's going to change ... the more the @entity1 feel obligated to defend the status quo and to say that 's nothing going to change , the more pressure it indicates to me is on them to make these changes , partly on the economic side but i would also say on the political side			0

the @entity1 president had *previously* welcomed @entity20 's normalization efforts but now says @entity190 must go
@entity0 also demanded @entity20 lift the embargo and compensate his country for damages before the two nations reestablish normal ties
both leaders announced december 17 they would move toward renewing full diplomatic relations by reopening embassies in each other 's countries
the @entity16 said today it would not close the naval base at @entity4 even after it shuts down the prison there
