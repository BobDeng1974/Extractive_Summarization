by @entity0 a 14 - year - old @entity2 girl was filmed telling her school board off after they had her father arrested for breaching a two minute rule for speaking			1
@entity7 told the @entity8 ‘ i do n’t trust you ’ only minutes after watching father @entity10 being handcuffed and hauled off by a police officer at the board ’s request			1
the arrest came after @entity10 became upset while being told to be quiet during a discussion about the book ‘ @entity20 , ’ which includes graphic sexual content he felt was inappropriate for a classroom			1
‘ i just watched my father get arrested because he broke the two minute rule , at a board of education meeting			1
‘ this just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of conflict and i am appalled , ’ the teen continued			2
‘ so i do n’t trust you			2
’ her comments came after a police officer hauled her father out of the room , slapped handcuffs on him in the hallway and led him out of the school , as shown in video from @entity45			1
the man was arrested for objecting to a book that includes a graphic sexual content describing rough sex between two teenagers , according to @entity51			0
the sexually - charged read culminates with : ‘ semen , sticky and hot , pooled on the carpet beneath her , ’ according to the website @entity57			0
' this is ridiculous ' : @entity10 ( gesturing and wearing a suit while sitting down at left ) objected to not receiving notification of the book 's graphic content sooner ' you 're arresting me ? ' ; the outraged father was only further aggravated by the police officer arriving to cart him away ‘ this is ridiculous , ’ @entity10 said in response to another parent arguing in favour of allowing high schoolers to read the novel			1
‘ why do n’t you have me arrested , why do n’t we do that as a civics lesson ? ’ he continued			0
‘ @entity79 lesson right ? ‘ nobody ’s talking about censoring the book , nobody ’s talking about banning the book or burning the book , ’ @entity10 continued as he was asked by a moderator off camera to be respectful of other people in attendance			1
‘ like you ’re respectful of my daughter right ? ’ he fired back as an officer confronted him			0
taken away : @entity10 is led out of the school by a cop cuffed : he is then arrested and led outside before his daughter 's outburst ‘ you ’re going to arrest me because i violated the two minute rule ? ’ he asks the cop			1
‘ this is ridiculous , ’ @entity10 says when the cop says he will be arrested			1
‘ this is the civics lesson			0
’ the father is then led out of the board meeting with his young daughter running behind him into the hallway and watching him being handcuffed shortly before returning to chide the board members			1
his wife @entity107 stood by her man when interviewed by @entity51			0
‘ i fully understand how he feels			0
it really is a huge violation , ’ she told the station			2
‘ why should those ideas be put in their mind			0
they can discuss this some other way			0
they do n’t need that kind of imagery			0
’ the school sent notifications home to parents , but only after students had already received the book			2
it is not exactly clear what crime @entity10 was charged with , and @entity125 was not able to immediately reach local authorities .			2

@entity7 told the school board that arresting her father left her ' appalled ' and unable to trust the board members
father @entity10 was taken away in handcuffs for violating the ' two minute rule '
