concerns : a previously hidden email from @entity3 medical director sir @entity2 criticised ' persistently high ' death rates in @entity6 hospitals @entity7 has been accused of trying to cover up warnings over high death rates and lengthy waiting times at hospitals in @entity6			1
an email written by sir @entity2 , the medical director in @entity14 , said mortality rates at six sites were ‘ persistently high ’ and criticised ‘ worrying ’ waits for cancer tests			1
but it has emerged that officials in the devolved government tried to suppress the message ’s release because the information it contained would ‘ prejudice the conduct of public affairs ’			2
sir @entity2 ’s email to dr @entity30 , his counterpart in @entity6 , was only uncovered when it was released under @entity33 laws			1
an email sent by the director of corporate and legal services at the @entity37 , @entity38 , to @entity14 , argues that there is a risk the two medical directors might be too scared to communicate with each other in future			1
the details were uncovered by @entity46 mp @entity45 – again using freedom of information laws – who accused the devolved @entity49 in @entity6 of being ‘ committed to cover - ups			1
’ ‘ if it was not for sir @entity2 , this evidence of potentially fatal diagnostic waiting times , and high mortality rates would probably have been hidden from the public and the welsh people , to protect political careers and pensions			1
’ in her email sent to @entity14 in february – days before the information was released – @entity38 argues that it should not be made public because the medical directors need ‘ a safe space			2
’ it adds : ‘ disclosure of the records of these conversations would likely undermine this safe space , and would severely limit the ability of @entity72 directors in @entity14 and the devolved administrations raising and work through sensitive and complex issues together			0
she says the email is a follow - up to an earlier phone - call to @entity14 – presumably trying to block the release of information – and adds that @entity6 ’ first minister , @entity83 , ‘ is very likely to support our approach			1
’ yet despite sir @entity2 ’s warning email five months ago , the @entity6 @entity3 have still failed to investigate death rates and waiting times			1
miss @entity45 , who sits on the health select committee added : ‘ this all reeks of the fatal cover - ups at @entity90			1
the @entity91 say they have learned lessons from the @entity90 scandal			0
' if they have , for the sake of @entity6 patients , i would make a plea to @entity98 to prevail upon his @entity7 colleagues to make them agree to conduct a @entity2 style review of safety in the @entity3			1
' likely support ' : a government lawyer implied that first minister @entity83 supported the email being suppressed ‘ the time for attacking the messenger is over , we need urgent action			2
lives could be at stake			0
’ the situation in @entity6 has prompted thousands of patients to cross the border to @entity116 hospitals in the hope of better treatment and shorter waits			2
concerns have also been raised by @entity7 mp @entity121 who emotionally revealed the shocking care of her husband @entity123 in 2012 at one of those hospitals with high death rates , @entity127 of @entity6 , @entity128			1
latest figures show that 15 out of the 18 district general hospitals in @entity6 have higher than average mortality rates			2
@entity132 , @entity46 mp for @entity133 , @entity134 , said : ‘ this smacks of a cover - up			1
i ’m hugely concerned by the plummeting standards of care in @entity6			0
‘ people are queuing up to get out of the @entity6 system to come to @entity14 because they are worried about the lack of care and much longer waits			0
now it seems the @entity145 is deliberately trying to cover up the very serious concerns			0
‘ what ’s happening in @entity6 should serve as a warning sign to anyone thinking of voting @entity7 in the next general election			0
the @entity3 can not be trusted in their hands			0
’ deadly : the @entity127 of @entity6 in @entity128 is one of those with high death rates welsh assembly member @entity154 , the @entity155 in @entity6 , said , ‘ the @entity7 ministers in the @entity37 have been caught red handed trying to cover up concerns from @entity14 ’s most senior clinician about high death rates in @entity6 hospitals and excessively long waiting times			1
‘ the 2013 data shows that every hospital in @entity6 , bar three , has a death rate above the @entity14 and @entity6 average yet @entity167 wanted to keep it all hush - hush to avoid criticism and refused to take advice and investigate - it ’s a disgrace			0
a @entity37 spokesman said : ' these emails have been in the public domain for three months			0
' this letter was sent as part of the normal process of considering an @entity33 request			0
' the @entity3 is open and transparent - our diagnostic waiting times are published every month and mortality rates are published every quarter			1
' ‘ if anywhere else in the @entity183 had death rates as high as some of those in @entity6 , there would have been a @entity90 - style investigation by now , but @entity7 are shamefully covering up their own failure for narrow party political reasons			0
’ ‘ the @entity3 is on its knees , reeling from @entity7 ’s record - breaking cuts , closures and cancellations			0
’ unlike the @entity3 in @entity14 , whose budget has been protected from public spending cuts , the @entity37 have slashed theirs by eight per cent since 2009			2
in addition , @entity7 health ministers rejected @entity202 ’s target regime and allow private sector firms to carry out some @entity3 treatment which have both been credited with bringing down waiting times			0
figures show that almost 50 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests to diagnose cancer compared with a 1 per cent figure in @entity14			0
and @entity6 refused to implement a @entity212 , which pays for treatments rejected by the @entity3 or awaiting approval , meaning many patients are denied life - saving drugs they can get in @entity14 .			2
