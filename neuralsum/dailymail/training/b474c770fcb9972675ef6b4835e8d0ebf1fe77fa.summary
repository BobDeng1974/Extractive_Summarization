the captain was the only person who had his own cabin on board the submarine			2
the one pictured here is around 2 metres by 1 metre and contains a pull down sink moving through the submarine , you pass the radio and sonar compartments ( imaged ) on your left ( the boat 's starboard side ) and captain 's cabin on your right ( the boat 's port side ) once strictly off limits to the public , @entity8 now lets anyone take a peek around the sonar and radio compartments			1
however , much of this was removed by the navy when the submarine was decommissioned as it would have still been on the secret list			0
