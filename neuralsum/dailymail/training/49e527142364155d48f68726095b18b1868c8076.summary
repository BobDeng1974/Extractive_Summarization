compassion : prince @entity1 has said the @entity2 should listen to patients and be more caring the @entity4 must learn to listen to its patients and be more caring , prince @entity1 said yesterday			1
modern medicine and technology are putting the ‘ human touch ’ at risk , according to the heir to the throne			2
in a heartfelt plea , he said medical schools should try to foster a climate of care and compassion among doctors			1
@entity1 ’s intervention follows a series of reports of appalling treatment by @entity2 staff , including dying patients left screaming for water			1
he called on doctors and nurses to heed what patients say so they can develop the ‘ healing empathy ’ so badly needed			2
writing in the @entity31 , the prince set out a vision apparently in response to studies showing many patients feel ignored			2
he said : ‘ in the individual encounter between patient and clinician , we are led to believe that there is currently a “ crisis in caring ”			2
i am sure that this is not the case in many or most such encounters			0
‘ nevertheless , i am equally sure that there is much more that can be done to foster and enhance those age - old qualities of human kindness and compassion			1
‘ the media is full of instances where these have been palpably lacking , and i have heard of others speaking of the need to restore urgently a climate of care and compassion at the heart of our health services			1
’ last month , health secretary @entity61 said there was a ‘ kind of normalisation of cruelty ’ in the worst hospitals , with patients too often subjected to coldness , resentment , indifference and even contempt			0
@entity72 , @entity73 mp for @entity74 , broke down when describing how her husband of 49 years , @entity76 , ‘ died like a battery hen ’ in october after being admitted to the @entity77 in @entity78			0
and , in an unprecedented move , the chief nursing officer for @entity80 says nurses will now be formally judged on the compassion they show in ‘ treating patients with dignity and respect ’			1
the @entity87 has highlighted abuses of patient care in its dignity for the @entity92 campaign			1
in his article , the prince said there was unease about poor listening skills that ultimately let down patients			0
one senior professional had impressed upon him the need to equip staff ‘ with skills and a desire to listen and honour what is being said and – importantly – what is not said to them ’			0
@entity1 said a healing empathy could only develop with a ‘ thorough understanding of the patient ’s story ’			0
despite his reputation as a supporter of alternative medicine , the @entity111 stressed he did not want to confront accepted medical wisdom			1
but , he said , the best of science and technology must not be deployed ‘ at the expense of the human elements ’			0
the prince has endorsed homeopathy and has had treatment from herbalists and chiropractors for ailments including severe back pain			0
he says complementary therapies should be used alongside conventional medicine			0
the @entity111 said : ' it seems to me good medicine should aim for a better balance between what science and technology may demand and what patients may actually want and need			0
¿ prince @entity1 talking to staff at @entity139 based at the @entity140 , @entity141 , during a recent visit but he has been criticised by leading medical figures including @entity145 prize - winners , for backing therapies they claim undermine treatments proven to work and may even put patients at risk			1
in his guest editorial , the prince said he had long advocated truly integrated systems of providing health and care ‘ not without criticism ’			1
but the need for a wider perspective on healthcare remained , particularly when the lack of compassion undermined the very purpose of doctors ’ training			2
he said : ‘ it is particularly surprising so many appear to think there is a gap here , when we are told those so - called “ soft skills ” of caring can have a significant impact on the quality and pace of recovery among patients			0
prince @entity1 has spoken out on medical matters previously arguing that complementary therapies such as homeopathy should be used alongside conventional medicine ‘ this inevitably raises the question : “ are we doing enough to ensure there is sufficient empathy and compassion instilled throughout training in medical schools and in later hospital training ? ” ‘ should we not , perhaps , be doing more to enhance the length of contact and continuity , when it comes to relationships between professionals and patients ? ‘ it appears to many ... that our capacity for providing “ the human touch ” has steadily decreased as science and technology have improved			1
surely , it should not be either / or ? thus , it seems to me good medicine should aim for a better balance between what science and technology may demand and what patients may actually want and need			0
’ dr @entity208 , the journal ’s editor , said : ‘ this is an important article and the prince ’s vision for health is engaging			0
’ a @entity215 spokesman said : ' ensuring that patients get the best possible care is a priority			2
we have been clear that quality of care needs to be valued as highly as the quality of treatment			2
' ' nursing leaders recently launched a new drive to ensure values such as compassion and courage are at the heart of the @entity2 and the public health and care sectors			1

his royal highness makes heartfelt plea to medical profession
@entity2 should foster climate of care and compassion , he says
intervention follows series of appalling cases highlighted by the @entity87
