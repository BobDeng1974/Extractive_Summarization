@entity1 's campaign at the @entity2 looks set to be dominated over whether @entity3 is included - but @entity4 may not need him			1
in front of over 30,000 at the @entity6 , @entity1 came from behind to defeat @entity7 3 - 2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the @entity11 this summer			1
@entity4 is still expected to do everything he can to include the @entity14 striker , but the win over @entity7 shows that the @entity16 can go toe - to - toe with the cream of @entity18			1
here @entity19 looks at @entity1 's three stand - out stars from the win in @entity22			2
@entity23 the @entity25 star has already become an established member of the first team at @entity28 's and is set to be a key member of @entity4 's side in the @entity11			1
the 20 - year - old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space			0
but his attacking play extends to set - pieces			0
@entity7 's @entity38 reaches out in vain as @entity23 fires home @entity1 's winning goal the @entity43 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance in @entity46 , @entity1 have potentially their best dead - ball specialist since @entity48 with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game			1
@entity53 was captain for the @entity7 victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on			0
@entity59 named the official @entity60 , @entity59 put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for @entity7 's opening goal after allowing the cross for @entity66 to fire home			2
but after a slow start to each half , the @entity71 full - back , on loan from @entity69 , imposed himself down the right - hand side			0
@entity59 runs the ball out of defence for @entity1 as @entity7 substitute @entity78 looks on @entity59 put in a @entity60 display having assisted two of @entity1 's three goals it was the 23 - year - old 's cross for @entity83 which helped draw the @entity1 level in the first half , while he also provided the pass for @entity53 to tuck home the winning goal			1
with @entity1 's senior team lacking depth in the right - back area , @entity89 could do worse than pick @entity59			0
because if he does n't , then @entity93 will as he can still play for the @entity95 team			0
@entity96 relished the battle with @entity7 full - back @entity98 , often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing			0
@entity96 is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach , with his passing in the final third managing to catch the @entity108 back four flat on a number of occasions			0
@entity96 rifles home @entity1 's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner @entity96 celebrates after drawing @entity1 level late in the game following an impressive display on the right it was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor @entity122 side in the @entity123 last season , but having struck the equaliser against a talented @entity7 team he looks to be improving			1
now a veteran of the @entity43 set - up , it will be difficult for @entity4 to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for @entity3 as he has often impressed on the right wing for the @entity16 .			2

@entity1 recorded impressive 3 - 2 win over @entity7 in under 21 *friendly*
@entity16 twice came from behind to seal late win at @entity6
@entity23 , @entity59 and @entity96 among stars
@entity4 's side look in strong shape heading to the @entity2 in @entity11 this summer
