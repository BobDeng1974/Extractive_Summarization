many millions have suspected it all along , but now the genie is out of the smoked glass bottle , the unvarnished truth laid bare on the pink and orange kitchen units			2
final proof of this comes in the fact that no one wants to buy his six - bedroom , @entity17 - listed , 16th - century @entity16 farmhouse			1
he says would - be buyers have been put off by the ‘ shifting sands of government policy ’			1
but i believe it was because they ’d rather sleep in a sheep ditch than live with his wallpaper			2
and who could blame them ? @entity7 , 50 , pictured here in his kitchen with wife @entity32 is having trouble selling his six - bedroom , @entity17 - listed , 16th - century @entity16 farmhouse			1
why ? @entity35 suspects it may be the decor the £ 1.6 million property just outside @entity38 has been on the market for more than a year			1
the retina - punishing interior , with every last primped and tweaked corner of it designed by @entity7 himself , must take the blame			1
buyers take one look at his work — the neon - hued kitchen , the gravy - coloured drawing room , the tree - painted bedroom , the giant peony print wallpaper , the stone lions by the front door ( i could go on ) — then head for the @entity16 hills			1
in a humiliating climbdown , the outrageously camp @entity7 has had to dismantle his own designs and redecorate the place with the kind of bland neutrals he loathes			1
ooh , his feelings must be hurt — but surely the only person surprised by the antipathy to his exuberant individual style must be @entity7 himself ? for the evidence of his frightful taste has been there , for all to see , for years			1
it is not so much his studiedly gaudy everyday appearance , with his tan leather jackets , polka dot shirt’n’tie combos , @entity79 beard and unquenchable fondness for a ruffle — although all that does not help			2
it is more his murky history as an interior designer and style expert on television shows such as the hit @entity90 series @entity88			2
before it ended in 2004 , @entity7 had a reputation for making people cry by forcing his vision of grand living on to what he described as their ‘ dark , drab and depressing ’ homes			1
@entity7 and his flamboyant taste had a reputation for making people cry on @entity90 hit tv series @entity88			1
' the evidence of his frightful taste has been there , for all to see , for years , ' says @entity35 this usually involved the great man insisting that they threw out their neutral , ‘ suburban ’ colour schemes and replace them with blood - red walls , furniture made from repurposed fruit crates painted in @entity110 colours and perhaps a dado - height glitter frieze of unicorns and dodos			1
‘ fabulous ! ’ he would shriek , as innocent housewives sobbed in the wreckage of their living rooms			2
meanwhile , the flamboyant designer would never miss an opportunity to lecture on his phobia about magnolia			2
he has always been very grand about not being bland			2
appearing on the @entity90 ’s @entity122 television show last year , @entity7 , now 50 , launched into a passionate diatribe against the colour beige			1
‘ in all its gory , in all its understated , delusional blandure , ’ he fumed			2
according to him , beige is ‘ always wrong , never sexy ’ and is ‘ just colour with the volume turned down ’			2
according to @entity7 , beige is ‘ always wrong , never sexy ’ and is ‘ just colour with the volume turned down ’			1
but the interior designer has been forced to tone down the decor of his home , in a bid to appeal to buyers the message was clearer than a coat of @entity140			1
those of us who love to take refuge in neutrals are deficient in taste and style			0
we lack the courage and discrimination of design arbitrators like him			0
he is right and anyone who disagrees is wrong and pitiable			0
and , of course , it is not really about paint — an undercoat of snobbery pulses through everything people like mr @entity7 advise and recommend			1
yet i love neutrals ! what could be nicer than a cool , quiet room in pale cream , a @entity165 - style template of white and grey , a ‘ greige ’ — grey - beige — horizon on a rolling wallscape of @entity173 ’s eternally popular paint shade @entity171 ? there are many times when i long for a world without colour , without someone like @entity7 pummelling the eyeballs with their bullying , hectoring , god - awful taste strictures			1
and do n’t you think that after being creamed and buffed , his mansion looks a thousand times better — a place a person would actually want to live in without throwing themselves out of a bedroom window ? following on from his television work , @entity7 now designs a range of furniture and soft furnishings for @entity195			1
his latest addition being a sconce , ' a typically @entity197 way of bringing in romantic light ' so where does this leave our @entity7 ? exposed as a taste fraud , with fifty shades of egg on face ? how did he ever become an arbiter of national taste in the first place ? like many television experts , his credentials appear scant : a fine arts degree and a stint with an interior design company before forming his own company and launching himself on the world			1
following on from his television work , he now designs a range of furniture and soft furnishings for @entity195			0
in an advert for them , he enthuses about the texture of one of his rugs , which ‘ feels like standing on a sea of soft cherubs ’			0
squelch and ugh ! anything new ? yes			0
‘ for the first time ever in my collection , i have incorporated a sconce , ’ he says , ‘ a typically @entity197 way of bringing romantic light into an environment			0
’ in one episode of @entity88 , @entity236 and @entity237 from @entity238 complained that @entity7 ’s scarlet walls ( similar to his own bedroom , pictured ) , zebra - patterned panels and leopard - print cushions turned their lounge into ‘ a w * * * * ’s palace ’			1
‘ it ’s going to have to go			0
every single bit , ’ said @entity236			0
or ‘ lighting a candle ’ as i call it			0
one wonders how he has the nerve			0
in 2010 , @entity7 became a ‘ celebrity ambassador ’ and designer for @entity254			1
he advised its customers to paint their bathrooms black and ‘ take a cold bottle of white wine ’ with them when they had a bath in the evening			0
@entity254 went bust the following year			2
of course , his greatest creation is himself			0
with his curls flapping and his certitude of opinion , @entity7 was made to paddle in the shallows of light entertainment television			1
particularly in the highly sensitive area of interior design , where a great number are unsure of their own instincts and desperate for the benediction of an expert			0
@entity7 , with his definite views on colour ( ‘ purple is sex personified ’ ) and his flowing cravat , was the man for the job			1
even if his reputation as a taste monger always seemed far from deserved			0
on @entity88 in 1998 , poor @entity284 had to be comforted by her husband @entity285 after @entity7 turned their dining room into something that looked like a snack bar in a crematorium			1
he opted for a ‘ queen anne style ’ , featuring a mock fireplace and portraits of @entity284 and @entity285 as royal mistress @entity293 and diarist @entity294			0
( oddly enough , it all looked very similar to his own @entity16 drawing room			0
) @entity284 thought that he was having a joke at their expense			0
‘ i thought she would really like it			0
i was very upset when she did n’t , ’ he said at the time			0
the £ 1.6 million property owned by @entity7 , just outside @entity38 , has been on the market for over a year in another show , @entity236 and @entity237 from @entity238 complained that @entity7 ’s scarlet walls , zebra - patterned panels and leopard - print cushions turned their lounge into ‘ a whore ’s palace ’			1
‘ it ’s going to have to go			0
every single bit , ’ said @entity236			0
and @entity313 from @entity314 fell out with @entity7 in 1999 when he turned her playroom into a ‘ brown death trap ’ , complete with a piano painted in orange and brown stripes and a toy box ‘ the size of a coffin ’			1
punches were n’t pulled when the cameras stopped rolling			0
‘ i kicked him out and called him a pretentious , frilly - sleeved prat with a paintbrush , ’ said @entity313 at the time			2
it is rather thrilling to know that even with all the time and money at his disposal , @entity7 still managed to make his own house look like a stage set for an am - dram remake of @entity334			1
so let us don our dark glasses and take a retrospective tour around the home where @entity7 , his wife @entity32 and two teenage daughters have lived since 2007			1
one style writer called it ‘ a witty homage to the @entity347 ’ , but the house - hunters who have trooped through its portals have been less than impressed			2
perhaps it was the orange and pink @entity350 toile wallpaper in the kitchen ? costing £ 63 a roll , it depicted courting couples at play			0
it came with a matching fabric , with which @entity7 had covered the seven lampshades in the kitchen			1
there was matching orange shelving , ornate mirrored sconces and a kitchen table covered with a red daisy @entity366 print			0
if he was aiming for the effect of being trapped inside an inflamed tonsil , he succeeded			0
before @entity88 ended in 2004 , @entity7 , pictured here with co-star @entity372 ( real name @entity372 ) , had built himself a reputation for making people cry upon seeing what he 'd done to their front rooms the bathroom was black , the bedroom had trees painted along the wall , the drawing room looked like a passageway in a country house hotel called @entity385			1
it was packed with heavy , shiny drapes , chocolate walls with a nude over the fireplace , burgundy leather chairs , knick - knacks on radiator shelves and elaborate branches of faux coral used as curtain tiebacks			2
it was exhausting to look at			0
in the new version , all the clutter and grandiose touches have been swept away			0
the fancy - shmancy has been ripped out , replaced with acres of cool beige and some @entity405 hotel lamps			2
it must have killed him to do it , but it is a vast improvement			0
after all this time , perhaps the frilly - sleeved , sconce - loving king of clutter should consider a career doing makeunders rather than makeovers			2
he might even sell his house at the same time .			0

@entity7 *'s* home has been on the market for over a year
is his 6 - bedroom , @entity17 - listed , 16th - century property *unsellable* ?
yes , says @entity35 , who *inspects* his recent makeunder of the decor
