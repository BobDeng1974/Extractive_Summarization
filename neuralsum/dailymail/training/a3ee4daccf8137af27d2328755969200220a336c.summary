by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , 14 , vanished in rough seas during the @entity5 @entity4 on the @entity6 on march 28 , 2012 a surf lifesaving race that claimed the life of a teenage competitor should have been postponed , a workplace health and safety inspector has told an inquest into the boy 's death			1
@entity2 , 14 , vanished in rough seas during the @entity5 @entity4 at @entity14 on the @entity6 on march 28 , 2012			1
the inspector and lifesaver , @entity17 , told the coronial inquest in @entity19 on monday that @entity2 's race should have been delayed because an inflatable rescue boat was not in the water at the time			1
mr @entity17 had compiled a report that found adequate procedures were in place at the event			0
the inquest has previously heard the device was stranded on the beach because a new driver could n't be found in time			0
mr @entity17 said the decision to start the race was ' problematic ' from a workplace health and safety perspective partly because there was a plunging wave with a shallow bank			2
' the fact that you 're dealing with kids who are n't as qualified in one sense and the fact that you did n't have the safety craft in position ... i think it should probably have been either delayed until that was in place and moved ... to where the break was n't as bad , ' he told the inquest			2
mr @entity17 also criticised an @entity54 application used by officials to rate the conditions during competition			1
inspector and lifesaver , @entity17 , told the coronial inquest in @entity19 on monday that @entity2 's race should have been delayed because an inflatable rescue boat was not in the water at the time the inquest previously heard the application described the under 15 boys as being ' at risk ' but that conclusion was dismissed as ' user error ' by @entity68 's coastal risk manager			1
mr @entity17 said the application attempted to make a ' quantitative ' assessment of conditions based on the user 's subjective judgment , and the results could be misleading			1
' it 's worse than useless in one sense because it can give you a false sense of what you 're doing is correct , ' he told the court			0
the investigator agreed there was a breakdown in the system of communication that day , because lifeguards ' concerns about the conditions were n't passed on to senior officials			0
@entity2 's mother , @entity91 ( right ) and sister , @entity89 ( middle ) left @entity93 on monday following the coronial inquest into his death his report also referred to a ' can do ' attitude within @entity68 , where there may be a reluctance to cancel events			1
' earlier in the day ... we know that the boats were assessed as too risky and ( officials ) moved those events , ' he said			0
' going back to @entity106 's inquest , too , the coroner there , coroner @entity107 , noted his concern when parties at that stage expressed a view that they should n't race and the officials were reluctant to cancel those events			2
' @entity106 was 19 when he died during a surf ski race at the same beach during the national titles in 2010			2
@entity2 's father @entity118 said he 'd like to see firm recommendations about the way surf lifesaving carnivals were run to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring @entity2 's younger sister @entity89 was visibly upset as she left the inquest following mr @entity17 's evidence			1
her father @entity126 said he was relieved the hearing was drawing to a close			0
' some points are very difficult to listen to , certainly not like the first part of the trial where we heard from the pathologist , ' he told reporters outside the building			0
' some of these things ( today ) are more perfunctory than anything , so my daughter was able to listen to a short amount of it before she left but i understand she 's upset now			0
' mr @entity2 said he 'd like to see firm recommendations about the way surf lifesaving carnivals were run to prevent a similar tragedy from occurring			2
the @entity2 inquest continues .			0
