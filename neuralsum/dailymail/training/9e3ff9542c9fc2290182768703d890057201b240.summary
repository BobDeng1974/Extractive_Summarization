killed : @entity8 murdered her ex-boyfriend @entity2 , pictured , who was found stabbed and shot in 2008 the five - month trial that began in january 2013 provided seemingly endless amounts of cable tv and tabloid fodder , including a recorded phone sex call between @entity8 and the victim , nude photos , bloody crime - scene pictures and a defendant who described her life story in intimate detail over 18 days on the witness stand			1
