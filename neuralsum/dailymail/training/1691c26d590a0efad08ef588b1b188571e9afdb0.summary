by @entity0 it has become the latest area of nutrition to be maligned			0
@entity4 , a protein found in wheat , barley and rye , has been linked with bloating , nausea , stomach cramps and fatigue and abandoned by a-listers such as @entity14			2
but new research suggests it may have been unfairly condemned - with ' healthy ' foods such as fruit , pulses and even common sweeteners to blame for bloating			2
unfairly maligned : @entity22 containing gluten might not be responsible for symptoms such as bloating and stomach cramps professor @entity27 , from @entity28 and the @entity29 , in @entity30 , was one of the first who suggested that gluten sensitivity could be behind bloating , but now he believes these symptoms are actually caused by short - chain carbohydrates called @entity37 - also found in many products that contain gluten , @entity34 reports			1
these carbohydrates are fermented in the bowel which means fluid is drawn in and gas is produced			1
this results in symptoms such as flatulence , bloating and an upset stomach			0
professor @entity27 told the publication : ‘ the issue is that wheat has not only gluten , but also @entity53 , and we have found that @entity53 are a very important source that stimulates gut symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome			1
‘ where gluten was being blamed , the @entity53 were probably the more important cause			0
’ dr @entity60 , a gastroenterologist at @entity61 's and @entity62 and the @entity63 , supports this theory and says a ' @entity66 ' diet can be very beneficial for people with @entity68			0
experts say @entity53 , not gluten , could be responsible for symptoms such as bloating and stomach cramps			1
image shows which foods are rich in @entity76 and should be avoided by people with irritable bowel syndrome he says it restricts foods containing poorly absorbed sugars			2
' it works on the principle that not all sugars can be absorbed within the small intestine , ' he said			0
' as a result , they are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the bowel which draws in fluid and produces gas			1
' this can cause symptoms including bloating , abdominal pain and diarrhoea			0
' foods containing @entity53 include honey , apples , pears , stone fruit such as peaches , onions , garlic , cabbage , beans and sweeteners such as sorbitol			2
@entity22 high in @entity107 also include milk , ice cream , yoghurt , broccoli , @entity113 sprouts , pasta , biscuits , watermelon , lentils , baked beans and chickpeas			1
research at @entity121 found that 75 per cent of those on the diet saw their symptoms improve			0
experts say some foods high in @entity76 are not absorbed easily meaning they ferment in the bowel causing water to be drawn in and gas to be produced			1
they say it is this that causes symptoms			0
image shows some foods that are low in @entity76 professor @entity27 studied the effect of @entity76 by looking at 37 people who believed they were sensitive to gluten			0
these people were given all of their meals by the researchers and took stool samples while swapping between high - gluten , low - gluten and gluten - free diets			2
the volunteers did not know which diet they were on at any one time but the researchers found they experienced the same symptoms regardless			0
as a result , professor @entity27 concluded that gluten was not causing their symptoms and hypothesised that they would be more likely to see benefits from giving up @entity37			1
he says the only people who should give up gluten are those who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease .			1

expert says it is not gluten but @entity37 that cause bloating and cramps
*fodmaps* are short - chain carbohydrates found in a range of products
also found in milk , apples , pears , pasta , lentils and beans
they are rapidly fermented by bacteria in bowel as they are not absorbed
causes fluid to be drawn in and gas to be produced , causing symptoms
' only people who should give up gluten is those with coeliac disease '
