by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:29 est , 5 august 2013 @entity3 : 19:54 est , 5 august 2013 @entity4 promised to stand by @entity5 last night as he urged @entity6 to avoid further actions which could ramp up tensions			1
after talks with @entity5 ’s leader @entity11 , the foreign secretary said : ‘ the @entity12 stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of @entity5 at this time of increasing @entity6 pressure and rhetoric			1
‘ we will respect @entity5 ’s 2006 constitution and the commitments the @entity12 has repeatedly made not to compromise on @entity12 sovereignty over @entity5			2
’ alarm : @entity22 is demanding an explanation over threats from @entity6 to impose border charges on @entity5 and he added : ‘ i call upon @entity6 to respect the agreements over the @entity27 and to avoid actions which could increase tension further			1
’ mr @entity11 claimed ‘ hell will freeze over ’ before @entity32 authorities remove an artificial reef @entity6 believes is harming its fisherman and which has been at the centre of escalating tensions			1
accusing @entity37 of ‘ sabre - rattling ’ , he said : ‘ the things that have been said are more reminiscent of the type of statement you ’d hear from @entity43 than from an @entity45 partner			0
‘ we ’ve seen it before during @entity49 ’s time but i think all of us hoped that those politics were never going to come back			0
’ row : @entity5 minister @entity11 ( left ) hit out at the aggressive stance of @entity6 's foreign minister @entity52 who threatened to charge thousands of workers £ 85 a day to cross the border @entity6 officials have continued to delay vehicles at the border , with moped and motorbike riders facing queues of two hours in 90 - degree heat to cross over from @entity5			1
@entity6 claims sovereignty over the @entity27 , which has been a @entity63 since the @entity64 in 1713			2
last week @entity6 foreign minister @entity52 threatened to levy tolls on border crossings and shut @entity6 airspace to flights bound for @entity5			1
but the @entity69 has made it clear that there will be no negotiation over sovereignty as long as @entity5 ’s people want to remain @entity12			2
@entity22 has now flown home from his holiday and will take charge of the crisis			1
the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ clearly , we remain seriously concerned by the events at the @entity6 - @entity5 border			1
‘ the @entity6 have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us			1
we are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target @entity5 with further measures			2
’ tensions : the @entity91 fears the proposed @entity6 border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to @entity6 for work queues : a woman gets out of a car as she waits in line to enter to the @entity12 territory of @entity5 at its border with @entity6 senior mps and government officials have accused @entity37 of ramping up the dispute to divert attention from the dire state of the @entity6 economy			1
@entity108 mp @entity107 said : ‘ the @entity6 are in deep trouble			2
their economy is in grave difficulties			0
they raise the issue of @entity5 to generate domestic support			2
‘ frankly , it ’s shameful for a country like @entity6 , who is meant to be an ally to the @entity12 , to treat @entity5 in this way			1
it ’s time they grew up and behaved like a democracy instead of bullying a small territory which has been @entity12 longer than it was @entity6			2
’ @entity125 sir @entity124 warned that @entity6 ’s tactics were unlikely to succeed			2
‘ it ’s a gross miscalculation to believe that the people of @entity5 , or the @entity69 , are likely to succumb to pressure of the kind that ’s being proposed , ’ he said			0
‘ if anything , it will simply stiffen resolve both in @entity134 and @entity5			0
’ and @entity136 ’s mep for @entity5 , @entity137 , even suggested that @entity12 send a gunboat to the @entity27			0
he said : ‘ it is time the @entity69 pulled its finger out and stopped mouthing diplomatic niceties to @entity37			0
‘ the @entity12 government must show some backbone to support the people of @entity5			0
‘ by sending a frigate to @entity5 , the message will ring out loud and clear : @entity5 is @entity12			0
’ the sovereignty of @entity5 is a major source of tension between the @entity12 and @entity6			1
both in 1967 and 2002 , the people of @entity5 rejected proposals for @entity6 sovereignty			1
despite this , @entity6 still asserts a claim to the territory			0
the tension began in 1704 when an @entity157 - @entity156 force captured @entity5 from @entity6 during the war of the @entity6 succession			1
the territory was then ceded to @entity12 under the @entity64 in 1713			0
historically , it has proved to be an important base for the @entity162			0
