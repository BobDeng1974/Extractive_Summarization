by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 15:29 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 01:02 est , 5 september 2013 the family of a 17 - year - old found dead in a high school gym mat have called for investigators to reopen his case after a second autopsy found that his death resulted from non-accidental blunt - force trauma			1
the independent report , which was released by experts hired by @entity14 's family who had their son 's body exhumed , directly contradicts the results of an autopsy performed by the @entity20 , which named positional asphyxia as the cause of death			1
@entity24 ruled the 17 - year - old 's death an accident , saying that the @entity28 student became lodged inside a rolled - up mat after falling in while reaching for a shoe			1
however , the family has a number of questions around the death particularly related to a group of students who were recorded on security cameras heading into the gym moments after their son			0
warning : @entity43 content these gruesome photos handed to @entity45 by the @entity47 attorney show @entity46 's body wrapped in the mat ( left ) , and his swollen , grotesquely misshapen face ( right ) his body was discovered on the morning of january 11 in the high school 's gym after his parents reported him missing the night before			1
now , attorney @entity55 , who represents the boy 's family , has sent the new autopsy report cited by @entity45 to the @entity59 @entity61 - @entity60 , the @entity20 , the @entity59 attorney for @entity64 ’s @entity63 and the @entity65 for review			1
the next step in the case would be to call a coroner 's inquest to decide the cause of death in a process resembling a grand jury			0
after noticing inconsistencies in the first autopsy report , the @entity14 family asked a judge for permission to exhume their son 's body and conduct another autopsy - a request that was granted in may			1
@entity46 's body was scrutinized june 15 by the @entity86 - based forensic expert dr @entity85 , who concluded that the teenager died from blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues near the carotid artery , ' consistent with inflicted injury			1
' @entity55 said the findings appear consistent with a possible assault			0
the results of the independent autopsy appear to dovetail with the report written by @entity98 who first examined @entity46 ’s ' body on january 11 , 2013 , which indicated that they observed ' bruising ' to the right side jaw			1
evidence : this sneaker was discovered next to the teen 's body in the gym			2
it has been suggested that he fell into the mat while reaching for it inconsistencies : @entity46 's parents insist that their son , whose shoulders were 19 inches across , could not have even fit into the opening of the rolled - up mat the first responders ' findings , however , were later refuted by subsequent reports filed by the crime lab that handled the case and the @entity20 's autopsy , which cited no significant injuries			1
a spokesperson for the @entity20 said the agency stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent autopsy			1
@entity55 said @entity14 's family does n't expect neither the @entity20 nor the sheriff ’s office to take an objective second look at the case			1
@entity14 's parents have always questioned the official version of what happened to their son on the day of january 10 , 2012 , rejecting the idea that the athletic boy accidentally suffocated after being lodged in a rolled - up mat while retrieving a shoe			1
the parents suggested that their son , who was 5 - foot - 10 , would not have tried to reach all the way down into a mat to grab his sneakers since the mat was about 6 feet tall and there was no way his arms could reach the bottom			2
another key factor is the width of the opening of the rolled - up mat measuring 14 - and - a - half inches across			1
the parents claim @entity46 , whose shoulders measured 19 inches across , would not have even fit into the opening			2
also , a question has been raised as to why none of the people who visited the gym that day spotted @entity14 ’s legs sticking out of the mat , which would have been the case had he fallen in with his arms stretched out			2
it is likely the boy would not have lost consciousness at once , leading those skeptical of the investigators ' version of events to wonder : why did n't @entity46 scream for help , and if he did , why none of the students who came to the gym to play basketball heard his voice ? the sneakers , which are at the heart of the @entity20 ’s theory , present another problem			2
if @entity46 fell while reaching to retrieve his shoes from the bottom of the mat , why did they end up lodged between his lower body and the inside of the mat , as if they fell in after him ? droplets of blood , which did not belong to @entity46 , were found on a wall not far from the teen 's body , but according to the @entity191 , no effort has been made to determine whose it was and how it got there			1
perhaps the biggest gap of all in the story is the mystery video showing @entity46 walking into the gym on the day of his death , followed by several other students			2
the sheriff 's department has not released the footage , citing the fact that it depicts minors			0
‘ we have really no recourse but to see whether or not the @entity61 or @entity59 attorney 's office would come in and reopen the investigation , ’ @entity55 said			0
the sheriff and his detectives spent nearly four months investigating @entity14 's death before closing the case in early may			1
from the very beginning , @entity14 's father , @entity214 , has been claiming that his son was murdered			2
' i want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad daylight ? ' we know our son was murdered while he was at @entity28			0
we do know that , ' he told a local television station in january			0
the teen 's aunt , @entity224 , said her nephew was a good student but ran into problems with another student last year , @entity223 reported			2
but the @entity20 autopsy found no signs of a struggle , officials said			2
it has been suggested by investigators that @entity14 may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat. a shoe was found at the scene , but it is not known whether it belonged to @entity46			1
' we feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole , ' the sheriff told the @entity243 , adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat ' but him and the good lord			0
' @entity14 , a 5 - foot - 10 , 160 - pound multi-talented athlete , attended classes on the morning of january 10 , 2012			2
just after 1pm , he entered the gym , never to come out alive			0
some 8 hours later , his mother , @entity250 , started to worry that her son did failed to make it home , @entity249 reported			0
at around 11pm , she drove to and from school looking for her son			0
after midnight , the mother called 911 to report him missing , and was told by a dispatcher that he was probably ' just out with some fast - tailed girl			0
' but mrs @entity250 knew that her son always called if he was planning to stay out late			0
at around 4am , she called police again and prayed through the night			0
at around 8.30am the following morning , @entity250 drove to school to ask around about her son			0
she was sitting in a guidance counselor office when she heard the fateful words on the phone : ' the found a body in the gym			0
' according to the sheriff ’s department , a school security camera captured the teen entering the gym at 1.09pm			0
what happened next remains unclear			0
lingering questions : @entity46 's parents have questioned the official autopsy report , suspecting that their son was murdered second try : the @entity14 family asked for and received permission to exhume their son 's body for another autopsy in june harrowing discovery : the teen 's body was found in the old gym at @entity28 in the south @entity64 town of @entity285 there was a gym class afterward and basketball practice in the gym that evening			1
nobody found @entity14 's body until the next morning			1
the sheriff told @entity243 on may 3 that students who did n't have lockers kept personal belongings such as gym shoes on top of rolled - up wrestling mats left propped up behind the gym bleachers			1
investigators found some of @entity14 's books and one tennis shoe near the body and believe they tumbled from atop the mat when a gym coach frantically pulled it over trying to free @entity14 after students spotted his feet			1
‘ we did everything we knew to do , and this is a tragic accident , ’ @entity309 told the newspaper in may			0
‘ but that 's all it was - an accident			0
