@entity3 , the deputy president of the @entity4 , said she was disappointed that since she was made a @entity6 in 2004 , no other woman has followed in her footsteps			1
men might be more likely to pick other men because it was easier to see merit in ‘ people who are like you ’ , she said			0
since her appointment , 13 lawyers have been elevated to sit in the country ’s highest appeal court as a judge , first in the @entity26 and from 2009 in the @entity4			1
@entity3 , a former @entity27 and @entity29 judge , said : ‘ most of you will also know that while i am flattered and proud to have been the first woman appointed as a @entity6 in 2004 i do not want to be the last			1
’ of all the 20 or so senior politicians and judges who have to be consulted on appointments to the @entity4 , she is the only woman			1
and the five - person selection committee which made three appointments - all men - to the court earlier this year , only one was a woman			2
@entity3 said : ‘ i think of the people who have to be consulted , i am the only woman			2
‘ i do not know whether the fact that the appointments process is dominated by men has anything to do with the choice of people			0
‘ it would not be impossible to speculate that it is always much easier to perceive merit in people who are like you than it is to discern the merit of those who are a bit different			0
