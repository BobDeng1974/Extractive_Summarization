a woman has shared the shocking story of how she was sexually abused by her father and had his baby when she was a teenager			1
@entity4 ( not her real name ) agreed to appear on today 's @entity6 and be interviewed by presenters @entity7 and @entity9 on the condition she would not be identified			1
speaking to them with her face turned away from the cameras , she revealed how she and her younger sister and older brother grew up in @entity16 in fear of their father			1
she said : ' i saw him as a very dark figure , very frightening			2
i could hear him talking to himself a lot , he was crazy , he thought the house was bugged			0
' @entity4 said he treated his son and daughters ' like animals '			1
they had no bedding and only ate bread and potatoes while he had ' fancy food '			0
he would torment them by buying pick n ' mix sweets and eating them in front of them			0
but his abuse was also far more violent and sinister than that			2
@entity4 recalled : ' there was a lot of physical abuse , he would hit us with poker , a belt , or with a branch on the back of our legs			2
my sister and i dressed like old women in long skirts to hide the bruises			0
sometimes he would force our brother to beat us			0
' @entity4 said she was just five years old when the abuse became sexual and her father started visiting her at night			1
' he was the boss , i did n't know any different , ' she said			0
she said she was too scared to tell anyone what was happening			0
' he warned me " if you lose me , you 'll be locked up in an institution and the key will be thrown away " , ' she explained			0
do n't suffer in silence : @entity4 is urging other victims to speak out as a result , @entity4 endured the abuse for years			1
then at the age of 14 , she was stunned to discover she was pregnant			2
' he told me i could n't get pregnant because he was my father			1
i believed that , it was such a shock , ' she said when she found out she was expecting			0
' i did n't know what was going on			0
he shouted at me and said " why did n't you take precautions ? " ' she said of her father 's reaction			1
he tried to arrange for her to have abortion but by the time @entity4 realised she was pregnant , it was too late for a termination			1
when her daughter , @entity89 , arrived , @entity4 said she was her ' pride and joy			1
' but because she was still 14 and they had nowhere to go , she had to take her baby back to live with her father			1
it was when she saw him acting suspiciously with the child that she knew she had to get them both away from him			0
i went out and came back to see him with the baby , her nappy was open , he was rubbing his hands together and he looked guilty , " what are you doing ? " i shouted at him			0
i knew then i had to get out of there , i thought " could this really happen to a little baby ? " ' she reported her father for what he had done to her but he was deemed unfit to stand trial because of his mental health			1
he was put into psychiatric care until he died			0
@entity4 tried her best to move on and give her daughter a happy life			1
she never intended to tell @entity89 the truth about who her father was - but she found out when she was a teenager after she discovered hidden paperwork relating to her grandfather			1
discovering the truth led to her feeling betrayed by her mother			0
' for a period , she hated me , ' @entity4 said			2
' she shut down and stopped dealing with her emotions			0
' @entity4 wonders if things would had been different if she had told @entity89 the truth earlier			1
their relationship is slowly improving and @entity89 is happier and travelling the world			2
speaking of why she has chosen to share her story , @entity4 said she hopes it will encourage other victims to speak out sooner than she did			2
' tell someone , get it out there , ' she urged			0
' do n't live with abuse and remember it 's not your fault			2
