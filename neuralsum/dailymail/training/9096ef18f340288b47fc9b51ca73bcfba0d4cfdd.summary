the dogs spanned 74 breeds and varieties and included 15 mixed - breed hopefuls , which had n't had any place at @entity4 for at least 130 years until last year 's agility contest ' anything can happen , ' said the dog trainer from @entity60 , @entity61			1
' the entries were as tiny as chihuahuas and as big as @entity66			1

@entity79 made it to the 50 - dog final round			2
@entity77 , of @entity80 , hugs her @entity78 , named @entity79 , while competing in the @entity20 on saturday half the 330 entrants were at least seven years old , middle - aged or older for most dogs			2

@entity129 , a @entity91 crested , competes in contest			0
the entries in the championship were as tiny as chihuahuas and as big as rottweilers besides training and competing in their favorite sport , the @entity135 put in 50 - plus hours a week as therapy dogs with @entity124 's mostly child and adolescent psychiatry patients in @entity142 , @entity61			1
@entity143 , a five - pound , wiry terrier mix that made it to the final , soared over jumps as though he 'd been bred to do it			2
but when @entity149 of @entity150 , @entity151 , adopted him from a shelter organization four years ago , he was so nervous he 'd never have been able to compete in front of an audience at @entity155 in @entity156			0
their teamwork in agility helped @entity143 learn to trust that @entity149 would always look out for him , and now ' he 's very confident , very outgoing , ' she said as he licked a visitor 's hand			0
