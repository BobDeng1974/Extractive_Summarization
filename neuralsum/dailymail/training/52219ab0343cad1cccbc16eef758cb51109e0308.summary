@entity4 has a stranglehold on the global supply of 17 rare earth materials essential for making high - end goods such as hybrid cars , camera lenses , mobile phones and weapons			1

the complaints filed today follow an earlier @entity7 challenge to @entity4 at the @entity10 on restrictions on other raw materials			0
