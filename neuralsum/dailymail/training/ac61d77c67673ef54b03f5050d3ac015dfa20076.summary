@entity1 authorities have ordered a search of secret tunnels beneath a former concentration camp complex where @entity6 scientists are believed to have conducted nuclear research in a bid to build an atomic bomb			1
the probe was triggered by a tv documentary which accessed wartime archives containing blueprints and eyewitness accounts of frantic attempts to beat the @entity16 in the race for the weapon to win the war			2
and recently , readings were taken of the area at @entity22 showing elevated levels of uranium - indications of subterranean implosions seven decades ago			1
readings taken at the site of the @entity29 concentration camp near @entity22 , @entity1 show elevated levels of uranium - indications of subterranean implosions seven decades ago			1
there are 15 miles of tunnels under @entity29 , a sub-camp of @entity34 ( above ) where tens of thousands of people were murdered in january 1944 , some 272 inmates of @entity34 were taken from the camp to nearby @entity22 to begin the construction of secret galleries			1
by november that year , 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death			2
( file picture of concentration camp inmates ) the 15 miles of tunnels lie under the nearby @entity29 concentration camp site , a sub-camp of the notorious @entity34 where tens of thousands of people were murdered			1
at one time , 40,000 slave labourers toiled in the tunnels making war weapons , including @entity53 aircraft			2
but now the hunt is on to find evidence of atomic research after a documentary by filmmaker @entity58 on @entity60 's quest for wonder - weapons beneath the @entity63 unnerved locals			1
the local authority has already spent £ 10,000 on preliminary searches of the tunnel system and is now seeking to assemble a team of international experts			0
one hitherto secret underground borehole found by geothermal imaging devices turned up an empty space yielding no clues as to what it might have been used for			0
if the @entity1 site does render up proof of nuclear research , historians may yet have to rewrite the last chapters of @entity80 to show how close @entity60 might have come to winning it @entity82 , a renowned historian at the @entity83 and head of a conflict research institute , is making his own researches in the area in the belief that plant and machinery related to nuclear research might be found			1
@entity58 searched archives in @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity16 for evidence of the @entity97 - led nuke building project			1
he discovered that on january 2 , 1944 , some 272 inmates of @entity34 were taken from the camp to @entity22 to begin the construction of secret galleries			1
by november that year , 20,000 out of 40,000 slave labourers drafted in to build the tunnels had been worked to death			2
after the war , @entity1 spent some £ 10million in pouring concrete into most of the tunnels			0
but @entity58 and his backers believe they missed a secret section where the atomic research was conducted			1
the @entity111 were stationed in @entity22 until 1955 and they took all of the files on the site back with them to @entity94			1
in january 1939 , nine months before the outbreak of the war , @entity93 chemists @entity116 ( pictured ) and @entity117 published the results of a historic experiment about nuclear fission experts are trying to discover if there is a link between @entity22 and sites in @entity93 proper where scientists were assembled during the @entity6 in a bid to match @entity16 efforts to build the ultimate weapon			2
in june 2011 , atomic waste from @entity60 's secret nuclear programme was believed to have been found in an old mine near @entity135			0
more than 126,000 barrels of nuclear material lie rotting over 2,000 feet below ground in an old salt mine			0
rumour has it that the remains of nuclear scientists who worked on the @entity6 programme are also there , their irradiated bodies burned in secret by @entity97 men sworn to secrecy			0
the thought of @entity6 atomic bomb material stored underground made headlines across @entity93 and the country 's @entity155 movement backed a call for secret documents relating to the dump to be released to the state parliament from sealed archives in @entity162			0
it was in january of 1939 , nine months before the outbreak of the @entity80 , that @entity93 chemists @entity116 and @entity117 published the results of a historic experiment about nuclear fission			0
the @entity93 ' uranium project ' began in earnest shortly after @entity93 ’s invasion of @entity172 in september			0
@entity174 physicist @entity173 led a team tasked to investigate the military applications of fission			0
by the end of the year , the physicist @entity178 had calculated that nuclear fission chain reactions might be possible			0
although the war hampered their work , by the fall of the @entity6 in 1945 , @entity6 scientists had achieved a significant enrichment in samples of uranium			0
if the @entity1 site does render up proof of nuclear research , historians may yet have to rewrite the last chapters of @entity80 to show how close @entity60 might have come to winning it .			2
