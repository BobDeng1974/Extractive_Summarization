news ratings for the week beginning september 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last march			1

@entity0 got the wind knocked out of its sails tuesday when @entity3 revealed the network 's evening news ratings have not beaten @entity6 's for the first time in 263 weeks , as they 'd previously believed @entity3 had said last week that @entity0 's ' @entity17 ' had averaged 8.42 million viewers for the affected week to 8.25 million for @entity6 's ' @entity19			1
' @entity6 had n't lost a week since 2009			0
but in its review , @entity3 found that @entity6 actually won the week by 170,000 viewers			2
@entity3 's statistics serve as the foundation for billions of dollars in advertising spending for the entire broadcast industry			0
@entity3 executives said the errors only became apparent in the past few weeks when the beginning of a new television season meant more people were tuning in			1
' the differences are small enough that those of us who look at these numbers every day and live by them did n't notice a difference , ' said @entity38 , @entity3 senior vice president for planning policy and analysis			0
both networks issued statements tuesday			0
@entity6 ’s said : “ we are pleased that the corrected numbers confirm that ‘ @entity19 ’ is the no. 1 news broadcast in @entity45 , and has been for the last 265 weeks			1
” @entity0 ’s said : “ for us , it has always been about the viewer at the end of the day			0
‘ @entity17 ’ is in the tightest evening news race in several years and we ’re honored the viewers are responding			1
” the mistakes came up in adjustments @entity3 makes to its ratings each day between an early morning estimate of viewers and a more complete accounting that is released late in the afternoon			2
the morning estimate does n't account for schedule changes in individual markets and sometimes does n't assign some market results to individual networks			0
@entity6 still # 1 : news ratings for the week beginning september 29 were affected by a software error that created miscalculations of television viewership dating back to last march			1
it was discovered that all of the unassigned viewing was mistakenly being credited to @entity0 , making that network 's afternoon viewership estimates consistently higher than those reported earlier in the day			2
@entity73 research chief @entity72 said his network became suspicious upon looking at ratings for ' @entity76 ' on sept. 22			0
two big @entity0 affiliates , in @entity78 and @entity79 , carried the ' @entity81 ' game that night between the @entity82 and @entity83 instead of ' @entity76			0
' when @entity3 adjusted its ratings to account for two large markets that did not carry ' @entity76 , ' it stood to reason that the show 's ratings would drop with the more detailed afternoon accounting			2
instead , the ' @entity76 ' afternoon numbers went up			0
@entity73 began noticing a pattern of @entity0 ratings being adjusted upward in the afternoon and called it to @entity3 's attention , @entity72 said			1
it 's unclear whether the errors are significant enough to impact advertising spending , which is based on @entity3 's estimates of how many people are watching individual shows			0
@entity3 said that in more than 98 percent of programs , the difference was 0.05 of a ratings point or lower .			2

@entity19 and @entity105 beat out @entity0 despite ratings that said otherwise , @entity3 revealed tuesday
@entity108 at @entity17 had *briefly* *enjoyed* *victory* over their news rival
