the £ 653million spent on drugs to stave off a flu pandemic was ‘ money thrown down the drain ’ , a damning report found yesterday			1
the drugs – @entity6 and @entity7 – were stockpiled at huge cost by health chiefs in the hope they could stem the effects of a pandemic			1
the mass purchase was triggered in 2005 when @entity15 scientists warned that as many as 700,000 @entity16 could die from deadly bird flu			1
the mass purchase of @entity6 and @entity7 was triggered in 2005 when @entity15 scientists warned that as many as 700,000 @entity16 could die from deadly bird flu after millions of doses were stockpiled , spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu ( @entity25 virus ) in 2009 , the first pandemic in 40 years			1
the anti-viral medicines were purchased to reduce admissions to hospital and dangerous complications from flu such as pneumonia			0
but the drugs work no better than remedies such as paracetamol , according to an analysis by researchers			1
there are also claims that vital information from clinical trials was withheld from regulators , researchers and doctors			0
the report , which analysed data from published and unpublished trials , concludes there is no evidence to show that the drugs reduce hospital admissions or complications			2
it also says the two drugs do shorten the symptoms of flu but only by half a day – about the same as some over-the - counter drugs			2
the review by @entity58 , an independent , international network of researchers , also found @entity6 had side effects including a higher risk of psychiatric and kidney symptoms			1
the authors of the report , published in the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , called for an immediate end to stockpiling of the drugs on the basis of the evidence			1
dr @entity71 , professor of evidence - based medicine at @entity73 , said : ‘ the money spent has been thrown down the drain			0
there is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic			2
’ the drugs worked no better at relieving symptoms than over-the - counter medicines but had potential to ‘ cause great harm ’ , he said			0
a second author , dr @entity85 , a clinical epidemiologist , said : ‘ the evidence does n’t justify stockpiling – we should stop it			0
’ the investigators said there had been ‘ multi-system failure ’ which included the role of regulators , the @entity94 – which approved licensing of the drug in @entity97 – and the drugs watchdog @entity98			0
spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu ( @entity25 virus ) in 2009 , the first pandemic in 40 years investigators from @entity58 say the original evidence the drug companies gave to the government was incomplete			1
they used a huge amount of data only made available by manufacturers @entity110 and @entity112 after ‘ years of struggles ’ , said @entity66 editor - in - chief dr @entity114			0
the findings , based on 46 trials involving more than 24,000 people , cast doubt on whether the drugs are worthwhile fighting flu and suggest ‘ insufficient grounds ’ for using @entity6 as a preventive measure			1
@entity110 said it ‘ fundamentally disagreed ’ with the findings			0
between 2006 - 07 and 2012 - 13 the @entity125 spent £ 609million on antiviral medicines , £ 473million on @entity6 and £ 136million on @entity7			1
this includes £ 74million written off because poor record keeping meant medicines had to be thrown away			0
the swine flu pandemic claimed 457 lives in the @entity132 between june 2009 and april 2010			1
there were no human cases of bird flu in the @entity132			1
the latest review follows a highly critical report in january from mps on the @entity139 which warned that a further £ 49million was at stake because drugs running out of shelf life were due to be replaced			2
but the dh confirmed last night that a 2008 contract with @entity110 meant the drugs had been delivered and the money spent in 2013/14 but professor @entity147 , chair in influenza virology at @entity149 , said other evidence showed the drugs benefited sick pregnant women and stockpiling had been ‘ prudent ’			2
@entity132 medical director dr @entity154 said : ‘ @entity110 stands behind the wealth of data for @entity6			0
the report ’s methodology is often unclear and inappropriate , and their conclusions could potentially have serious public health implications			0
’ the @entity125 said : ‘ @entity6 is licensed around the world for the treatment of seasonal flu and is a licensed product with a proven record of safety , quality and efficacy			2
we regularly review all published data and will consider the @entity58 review closely			0

@entity6 and @entity7 were stockpiled to stave off a flu pandemic
mass purchase triggered in 2005 when @entity15 scientist warned as many as 700,000 @entity16 could die from deadly bird flu
researchers discovered the drugs work no better than paracetamol
authors of report have called for stockpiling of the drugs to end
