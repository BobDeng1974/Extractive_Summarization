by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:19 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:00 est , 21 december 2013 @entity3 describes the moment her daughter @entity4 was diagnosed with cancer as like stepping on to a rollercoaster			1
but now , two years on , the 12 - year - old is free of the disease – thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy at the cutting edge of cancer technology			1
@entity15 - beam therapy is already paid for by the @entity16 for certain rare cancers , but patients have to travel to the @entity19 for treatment			1
now it is set to come to @entity22 , after a @entity24 pledge of £ 250 million this summer to build two proton therapy centres , due to open in 2018			1
success story : @entity27 , 12 , is now in remission from tissue cancer thanks to a new type of highly targeted radiotherapy the pioneering technology kills cancer cells in a similar way to conventional radiotherapy but uses proton beams instead of x-rays			1
protons are tiny positively charged particles found in the centre of atoms that are generated and focused into beams in large particle - accelerators called cyclotrons			2
but unlike x-rays , proton beams release their energy only when they reach their target – meaning much less damage to surrounding healthy tissue			1
that reduces the long - term side effects of treatment , which is particularly important for children			2
@entity4 , who had a rare tissue cancer called @entity54 , was an ideal candidate			1
her cancer affects about 60 children in the @entity22 each year and develops from muscle or fibrous tissue in any part of the body			1
@entity4 ’s tumour was at the back of her palate , meaning surgery was n’t a viable option			1
its proximity to her eyes and nose made the pinpoint accuracy of proton - beam therapy extremely beneficial			1
‘ i ’d never heard of proton - beam therapy before , ’ says @entity3 , a medical secretary			1
@entity73 : @entity4 and her mother @entity3 ‘ when the doctor told us it was available only in @entity19 , i immediately thought of the cost and how we could afford it , but the doctor said that if the panel decided it was the best option for @entity4 , the @entity16 would pay for it			1
’ the panel agreed , and in march 2012 @entity4 travelled to the @entity19 with her parents @entity3 and @entity85 and younger sister @entity86			1
@entity4 had 28 sessions over a nine - week period , which fell halfway through her six months of chemotherapy			2
@entity15 therapy is done in tandem with chemotherapy and its timing in the cycle is crucial			0
the treatment is ‘ posh radiotherapy ’ , according to dr @entity96 , the @entity22 ’s clinical lead on proton - beam therapy			1
‘ it ’s unlikely that it is going to cure any more children with cancer but it reduces the chances of long - term side effects and secondary cancers in later life			1
but in adults with some rare cancers like sarcomas of the skull and spine , proton therapy can mean an increased dose of treatment can be directed at the tumour , potentially curing more patients			1
’ each treatment room costs about £ 20 million , more than ten times the cost of the linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy			2
the @entity16 has been sending patients to two centres in the @entity19 – in @entity125 and @entity126 – since 2008 , at a cost of £ 97,500 per patient			1
once the machines begin operating in this country , these costs should drop to about £ 40,000 per patient			2
‘ it is an expensive treatment but at the moment a significant proportion of the cost is travel , accommodation and chemotherapy in @entity19 , ’ says dr @entity96 , whose team have reviewed 504 potential patients since it became available on the @entity16 in 2008			2
of those , 383 have been approved , 70 per cent of them children			0
@entity4 ’s treatment began with surgeons inserting tiny beads , known as fiducial markers , into the surface of her skull			0
these show up on the scan and enable the radiographer to target the proton beams precisely at the site of the tumour			2
a custom - made mask was fitted over @entity4 ’s face to keep her head in place for each 40 - minute session			2
‘ i was worried about how @entity4 would cope and if she ’d be able to stay still for so long , ’ says @entity3			0
‘ we thought she might need to have each session under general anaesthetic [ as some youngsters do ] , but she did brilliantly			0
’ @entity4 recalls : ‘ it was a bit scary at first but i got used to it			0
by the end i sometimes felt so ill i could n’t even be bothered to feel emotions			0
’ importing treatment : the @entity22 government has pledged £ 250million to build two centres to treat cancer with proton therapy a side effect is that the beams burn the area targeted			1
@entity4 ’s throat became so sore after two weeks that she had to be fed through a tube for the final five weeks			0
‘ she was very weak , ’ says @entity3			0
‘ those last weeks were the worst of my life			0
we were so isolated and at the weekends when @entity4 had a break from treatment , we would just sit in the hotel room counting down the hours			0
@entity4 would sleep or just sit there			0
’ the new @entity22 centres – one at @entity190 ’s @entity189 and the other at @entity192 , @entity193 – will mean patients can be treated closer to home			2
and the number treated is expected to rise from 79 @entity16 referrals last year to 1,500 annually			0
some medics are sceptical about how many people will be eligible for the technology , and last month ’s report making the case for the @entity203 said there are ‘ considerable risks in ensuring patient numbers ’			0
but dr @entity96 says this is because proton - beam therapy is still in its early stages			1
‘ it ’s for very specific rare cancers and we ’ve got to be careful about raising false hope , but if you ’re that patient it could make a huge difference to your prognosis			0
’ @entity15 - beam therapy is by no means a miracle cure as only one per cent of patients currently receiving radiotherapy are suitable			1
and it ’s too early to say whether the children treated develop fewer long - term side effects			0
but for @entity4 ’s family , the verdict is a positive one			0
last summer , scans revealed that her tumour had disappeared			0
@entity4 still has scans every six weeks but started secondary school in september and is thriving			0
‘ we feel privileged to have had the best treatment money can buy , ’ says @entity3			0
@entity27 was nominated for a @entity236 in partnership with @entity238			2
the awards celebrate the courage of all children diagnosed with cancer			2
to nominate a @entity243 , visit @entity244 .			0

@entity27 , 12 , was diagnosed with tissue cancer @entity54
she travelled to the @entity19 for highly targeted proton - beam radiotherapy
two years later the tumour at the back of her palate is gone
government has pledged £ 250m to build centres due to open in 2018
