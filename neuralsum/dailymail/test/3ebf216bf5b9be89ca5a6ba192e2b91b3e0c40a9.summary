designer @entity1 's family learned that it 's not always about who you know - or who you are are related to - after they joined the thousands of people who were unable to beat the ' pink sunday ' rush for the late ms @entity1 ’s eponymous brand ’s brightly - colored , limited edition collaboration at @entity10			1
the 250 - piece @entity1 for @entity10 collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on sunday morning			1
@entity18 , the 26 - year - old granddaughter of the @entity20 fashion trendsetter , managed to buy a floral - printed hammock online , but only because she set an alarm			2
meanwhile , mrs @entity1 's own daughter @entity23 wanted a beach chair - but missed out			0
the 58 - year - old @entity25 told the @entity26 that her mother , who died in 2013 at the age of 81 , ' would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something , a piece of @entity33 '			0
@entity23 admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand 's @entity10 collaboration designer demand : shopper @entity46 posted this picture of a cleared - out @entity10 store on sunday , writing that the racks were empty within five minutes ' i think wearing a @entity33 dress and wearing a @entity33 print makes people smile , and the fact more people would have the opportunity - i liked that , ' miss @entity18 added of the @entity10 collection			1
the @entity1 merchandise - which included clothing , accessories , and homeware from the designer at @entity10 's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside @entity10 stores before they opened			1
and while all of the popular products have now officially sold out , more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on @entity73 , many at higher price points , prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with @entity1 merchandise to boycott the second - hand sellers			1
a posting being shared on social media reads : ' here 's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today			2
boycott all second - hand seller of @entity10 's @entity84 until the prices drop below cost			1
do n't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $ 30 dress			0
' just say no : angry @entity1 fans took to social media to start a boycott against second - hand sellers of merchandise just say no : a @entity95 user named @entity96 noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to @entity10 if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on @entity73 colorful addiction : this woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home décor from the @entity1 for @entity10 collection different opinion : not everyone was a fan of the collection ; this @entity95 user named @entity110 could n't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs the message continues : ' if no one buys from @entity73 or instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they 'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks			1
this only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second - hand seller			2
' other @entity95 users noted that the highly - coveted items from the @entity1 collection will be returned to @entity10 and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers			1
' # @entity130 has a 14 day return window			0
boycott # @entity133 and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days , ' one person tweeted , another added : ' can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the @entity130 aka # @entity133 absolutely ridiculous [ sic ]			2
' @entity142 re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price , including a $ 150 hammock for $ 799 and a $ 34 maxi dress for $ 202.50			1
a $ 30 tote bag was posted with a buy it now asking price of $ 300			0
disappointed : @entity152 was angry that @entity10 did n't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time @entity157 woman : @entity158 , who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations , noted that people should have listened to her strategies shocking mark - up : @entity165 encouraged people to buy ' real ' @entity1 instead of spending hundreds on the @entity10 collaboration being sold on @entity73 however , within 24 hours , many more sold - out items became available on @entity73 for under $ 100 , including a $ 9.99 makeup bag that sold for $ 19.99 and a $ 15 headband that sold for $ 30			1
many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers , who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for ' true ' fans of the brand			1
' there 's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on @entity73 , ' one woman wrote on @entity95			2
another said : ' the people who bought hoards of # @entity130 products just to resell them online are ( literally ) the reason we ca n't have nice things			0
[ sic ] ' nothing left : many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various @entity10 stores band together : @entity204 told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on @entity73 better idea : she added that she would rather go to a @entity1 store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second - hand sellers no human decency : meanwhile , @entity215 noted that ' people are the worst ' while encouraging others to join the boycott other customers also complained of problems using @entity10 's website on sunday morning ; ' extreme traffic ' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases			1
@entity10 's chief merchandising and supply chain officer @entity226 apologized for the issues regarding the store 's website on the company 's blog on tuesday , saying the experience customers had on @entity235 on sunday morning ' was n't acceptable ' , while denying that the site had crashed			1
' our goal is to provide an easy , fun experience , whether guests are shopping online or in our stores			2
we did n’t get there with this launch and for that , we ’re sorry , ' she said			0
' the website never crashed , but due to high traffic , it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection			0
' she added : ' that ’s frustrating , both for them and for us			0
we ’re taking a close look at what happened			0
we ’re committed to constant improvement , and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great , seamless experience			0
' ms @entity226 also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection			0
fast fashion gets faster : @entity1 's lower - priced collection for @entity10 sold out almost immediately online and in stores ; customers re-selling this $ 34 maxi dress were netting bids over $ 200 pricey prints : pieces like this @entity1 bag , left , and hammock , right were quickly available at major mark - ups online , though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush ' one of the things we ’re incredibly passionate about at @entity10 is making great design accessible and affordable , ' she said			1
' when we see product that we ’ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit , it ’s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs			0
' she continued : ' when we look at the amount of @entity1 for @entity10 product being resold , it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection			0
while we ’d prefer that number to be zero , it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves			0
' but though frustrated fans criticized @entity10 for poor planning and a lack of bulk - buying policies , these are hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store 's past designer collaborations			2
the highly - anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads , lookbooks and celebrity - packed parties , resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on - sale dates to their calendars			2
in 2011 , @entity322 's collaboration with @entity10 crashed the website as well , and collections from @entity325 , 3.1 @entity326 , and @entity327 all saw marked - up resell value on @entity73 after selling out in stores			1
bait for the belles : ' the things @entity333 girls do for @ @entity334 [ sic ] , ' wrote customer @entity335 of the line outside a @entity337 , @entity339 @entity10 store @entity341 ladies love @entity33 : celebrities including ( l to @entity344 ) @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , and @entity348 all wore @entity1 for @entity10 dresses to the line 's launch party			0

the designer diffusion line went on sale sunday morning but was almost completely sold out online before noon , with stores selling out minutes after opening
re-sellers initially tried to unload merchandise at *inflated* prices including $ 799 for a $ 150 hammock ; now thousands of pieces are available on @entity73 with smaller markups
outraged customers have formed a social media campaign to boycott the merchandise from second - hand sellers
