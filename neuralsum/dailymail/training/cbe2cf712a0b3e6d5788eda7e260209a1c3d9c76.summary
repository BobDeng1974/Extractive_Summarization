by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 10:12 est , 25 february 2013 the skyscrapers of the future will be ' living ' buildings powered by algae that respond automatically to the weather and the changing needs of inhabitants , a new study claims			1
research by engineering multinational @entity10 , the firm behind the @entity11 , the @entity12 and many of the stadia for the @entity15 , has imagined how urban buildings could look by 2050			1
predictions include ideas as outlandish as jet - powered maintenance robots , high - rise farms and photovoltaic paint - all of which , incredibly , are already in development			1
skyscraper of the future : a new report claims that by 2050 buildings will have modular designs maintained by jet - powered drones , a digital ' nervous system ' and be entirely fuel efficient thanks to algae fuel cells ' in 2050 , the urban dweller and the city are in a state of constant flux - changing and evolving in reaction to emerging contexts and conditions , ' the report says			1
' the urban building of the future fosters this innate quality , essentially functioning as a living organism in its own right - reacting to the local environment and engaging with the users within			2
' the study by by @entity10 ’s internal thinktank predicts that structures will be fully integrated into the fabric of the city , responsive to changes in the external environment , and designed for continuous adaptability			2
responding to estimates that in four decades 75 per cent of an estimated global population of nine billion will be living in cities , it foresees a shift to increasingly dense urban environments			0
at the same time , it predicts , the rise of networked ' smart ' devices will lead cities ' where everything can be manipulated in realtime and where all the components of the urban fabric are part of a single smart system and an internet of things '			0
maintenance drones : the modular skyscrapers of the future could have interchangeable units shifted and lifted into place by jet - powered drones , according to the report 's predictions the @entity80 company that built the @entity81 has landed a contract to build what will become the world 's tallest building - and plans reveal the two look remarkably similar			1
@entity89 - based @entity88 won the £ 780million deal to build the @entity91 , pictured right in an artist 's impression , in @entity94 , @entity95 , which will stand more than 3,280ft ( 1km ) high			2
the @entity81 is currently western @entity97 's tallest building at 1,003ft ( 306m ) high			2
@entity88 will participate in a joint venture with fellow @entity80 firm @entity99 to create the huge building , which has been given a completion date of 2018			0
the @entity91 , which will have a construction area of more than 5,381,955 square feet , will stand at four times the size of the @entity81			0
it will overlook the @entity105 and is expected to take over from the @entity106 in @entity107 , which stands at 2,717ft ( 828m ) , as the world 's tallest skyscraper			0
it is not yet known how tall the skyscraper will be as developers keep exact details of the plan a secret			0
the most incredible prediction in the @entity10 report claims that the buildings of the future will benefit from brain - like ' intelligent building systems ' that enable them to automatically adjust to the needs of inhabitants			1
using data about energy consumption , weather , and the whims of residents , they will be able to make ' calculated decisions ' about how to best use resources			0
this could extend as far as using jet - powered maintenance arms to swap the ' modules ' that form the building blocks of the skyscraper			1
such modular components could be used for residential or commercial units , or even urban food production sites housing animal , fish or vegetable farms , depending on what is needed at the time			0
' in this emerging age , with significant developments in construction , prefabricated and modular systems are moved and assembled by robots that work seamlessly together to install , detect , repair and upgrade components of the building system , ' the report says			2
with human population set to mushroom , the predictions take into account likely increased concern about the pressure so many souls would put on our planet 's already - strained natural resources			0
the @entity10 report promises buildings that will one day in fact produce more resources than they consume thanks to external walls coated with photovoltaic paint , wind turbines and even pods growing bio-fuel producing algae			1
@entity176 spaces would be dispersed throughout the building to encourage urban biodiversity , while water systems would be optimised for recycling and reuse and filters would cut down on environmental pollutants , it says			0
green architecture : the report 's proposals include high - rise urban farms which can respond to urban demand , and algae - filled units which are able to grow bio-fuels to meet the needs of the community responsive : the facades , as well as having the potential to generate power from the sun , could also be coated with nano - particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants and capture waste carbon dioxide the building 's facades , as well as having the potential to generate power from the sun , could also be coated with nano - particle treatments that neutralise airborne pollutants and capture waste carbon dioxide			1
elements such as vast organic leds could even allow for whole surfaces of the structure to light up at night , creating a new form of street lighting			0
' coupled with daylight absorbing abilities , the technology realises the possibility of ' net zero energy ' artificial lighting , ' the report says			0
community integration : fully linked to the city 's transport networks , the urban dwellings of the future will integrate with the rest of the urban space and offer public spaces which encourage exploration , says @entity10 smart systems : using data about energy consumption , weather , and the whims of residents , the buildings of 2050 wil be able to make ' calculated decisions ' about how to best use resources the @entity10 report , entitled it 's alive , was put together by @entity241 , a consultant in the company 's foresight + innovation team , an internal thinktank which focuses on the future of the built environment			1
he concludes : ' by producing food and energy , and providing clean air and water , buildings evolve from being passive shells into adaptive and responsive organisms - living and breathing structures supporting the cities of tomorrow			2

research by engineering firm @entity10 has imagined the skyscrapers of 2050
the buildings could include high - rise farms and algae - *biofuel* cells
' intelligent building systems ' will adjust to the needs of inhabitants
jet - powered drones will maintain the modular structures , which can be *reconfigured* to suit the needs of society
