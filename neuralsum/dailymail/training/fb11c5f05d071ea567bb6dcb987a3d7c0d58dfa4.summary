by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 12:57 est , 21 january 2014 a collective sigh of relief was heard throughout the world last night as @entity5 woke from its two - and - half - year slumber			2
the probe creaked into action 500 million miles from @entity9 at 10am yesterday , taking an agonising eight hours to let @entity9 know that it was ok			1
‘ that last quarter of an hour was one of the toughest of my life , ’ mission director , @entity10 told @entity11			2
‘ i never want to do it again			0
it is due to arrive at the comet in august this year @entity5 , named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient @entity30 hieroglyphs , will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			1
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity9 and @entity20 to line it up with its final destination : @entity42 – @entity43			1
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity5 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity46 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
later this year , @entity5 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity53 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			2
@entity56 received the all - clear signal at 6.18pm , some 48 minutes behind schedule			2
a few seconds later , @entity5 sent the message ‘ @entity60 ! ’ out on @entity61 and @entity62			0
‘ having @entity5 go into hibernation was a nightmare for me , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
‘ it ’s the worst thing you can tell a mission controller that you ’re not going to be in touch with your spacecraft for a while , ’ said dr @entity10			1
‘ but i tell you , my life has changed so much since yesterday … and i ’m so happy			0
’ while the celebratory ribbons are being cleared away , mission control is hard at work to uncover any problems @entity5 may now be facing			2
the spacecraft , which was launched in 2004 , is due to rendezvous with comet @entity78 and land a probe on it this year in an unprecedented manoeuvre			1
‘ what we got yesterday was simple a radio frequency carrier from @entity5 saying “ i ’m alive ! ” ’ , said dr @entity10 ‘ we still need to get all the telemetry , which it ’s sending down now , and we ’ll be analysing that overnight			1
’ the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) received the all - clear message ' @entity60 ! ' from its @entity5 spacecraft , 500 million miles away , shortly after 6pm the signal was received by @entity94 's @entity93 ground station in @entity95 at 18:18 gmt , during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with @entity9			1
it was immediately confirmed in @entity56 's space operations centre in @entity101 ( pictured ) the @entity5 mission will perform several historical firsts , including the first time a spacecraft orbits a comet rather than just whizzing by it to snap some fly - by pictures , and the first time a probe has landed on a comet 's nucleus			1
@entity5 is also the first mission to venture beyond the main asteroid belt relying solely on solar cells for power generation , which is also why it had to be put into a deep sleep for 957 days			1
' it has been so far away from the sun that the solar rays were not able to generate enough energy to safely operate the spacecraft , said @entity5 spacecraft operations manager @entity121 , who has been working on the @entity5 mission since 1997			1
the data so far suggests that all the systems are healthy and working perfectly			0
' in the worst case scenario , the instruments are exactly as they were when we entered hibernation 2.5 years ago , ’ said dr @entity10			1
‘ in the best cast , they are better as they ’ve managed to get some rest			0
’ mission control have now switched on the space probe ’s mass memory , and in the coming days will reactivate the crafts four momentum wheels			1
these wheels are essentially fast rotating discs that spin at a few thousand revolutions per minute - similar to a gyroscope			0
they are used to keep the 3 - dimensional attitude of the satellite fixed direction			0
by monday , @entity5 is expected to be fully functional and will remain stable as it falls closer to the sun and its target comet			1
the craft is currently around 5.6 million miles from its destination and closing on the object at more than half a mile a second			0

the spacecraft 's orbit has brought it back to within 673 million km from the sun for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity5 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity46 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation @entity5 is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination , the comet @entity78 , and closing on the object at half a mile a second			1
the spacecraft , which was launched by in @entity164 in 2004 , will now spend several months approaching and orbiting the comet			2
once it has found for a suitable site , it will attempt a landing in november			0
scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples from the comet 's body			0
it now has @entity173 of power from the sun , but scientists want it to gain several hundred watts more before they can switch on its scientific instruments			2
they believe this will happen in early march as @entity5 heads towards closer the sun. ‘ what counts for us now is the relative speed between the spacecraft and the comet , ’ said dr @entity10			1
‘ it ’s now travelling around 1km per second faster than the comet			0
in may , we will need to correct that and slow it down to 0.5m per second – less than walking speed			0
’ by the time @entity5 reaches the comet in august , it will be travelling at only a few tens of centimetres per second			2
‘ what comes after that will be completely new , ’ said dr @entity10			1
‘ i would n’t describe it as a fear			0
but it ’s a big challenge and hugely exciting to learn how to fly around a comet and then try and land a probe on its surface ’			2
the manoeuvre is described by dr @entity10 as a ‘ gentle push ’ with @entity5 releasing the probe between 5 - 10 km away from the comet			1

dr @entity205 describes the moments leading up to the signal as the ' toughest of my life ' later this year , @entity5 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity53 lander onto the comet 's surface in november scientists have no idea whether the comet ’s surface will be as soft as snow or hard as ice			1
and unlike the @entity220 or a planet , the comet is too small , at 2.5 miles across , to have a significant gravity			0
so the lander will fire a harpoon into the surface to keep it anchored			0
lead scientist @entity226 said : ‘ the risks are huge			0
we had to develop something to land on something that was unpredictable and unknown			0
’ both @entity5 and the lander will be able to take images of the comet , as well as use their many onboard instruments to analyse samples			0
scientists hope the probe ’s findings will help them understand the composition of comets and thereby discover more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			1
they have speculated that comets - which are essentially giant , dirty snowballs - may be responsible for the water found on some planets			0
and like asteroids , comets also pose a theoretical threat to life on @entity9			0
‘ i ’m just extremely happy , and relieved , that @entity5 has woken up , ’ said dr @entity10			1
‘ what comes next will be incredibly exciting			0
’ the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity78			0

dr @entity10 claims the spacecraft is currently ' functioning perfectly '
by monday @entity56 plans to activate its mass memory and momentum wheels
group will soon be focusing on slowing the spacecraft to walking pace
@entity5 probe aims to better understand the composition of comets
it launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times
@entity279 has been hibernating for most of the past three years to save power
its alarm sounded at 10am but its signal to @entity9 did *n't* arrive until 6pm
the probe will land on comet @entity42 – @entity43 in november
scientists hope the mission will *provide* more clues about how the solar system came into existence
