by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 16 may 2013 a mother claimed today her daughter was pushed to suicide after police refused to reopen an investigation into sexual abuse she suffered as a child			1
@entity10 graduate dr @entity9 , 33 , took an overdose of prescription medication in october 2011 , at her home in @entity14			1
an inquest later found her ' neighbours from hell ' and a failed love affair had only partially contributed to the gifted academic 's despair and a narrative verdict was recorded			1
narrative verdict : @entity9 who took an overdose of prescription medication in october 2011 but her mother , @entity25 , 65 , claimed her daughter killed herself because the man who abused her , aged ten , had gone unpunished			1
dr @entity28 's abuser admitted what he had done to @entity30 in 1991 but because she was so young her mother decided she did n't want her to give evidence in court			1
that meant that the matter could only be dealt with by way of a caution and dr @entity28 had spent the rest of her life haunted by the knowledge her attacker was still free			1
but when the bright young doctor finally plucked up the courage to pursue her abuser she was told by police that the case was closed			2
and @entity30 said there was no way to reopen the matter because all the original paperwork had been destroyed - as was force policy at the time			2
six months later dr @entity54 committed suicide , leaving her heartbroken mother to dwell on the prospect that her abuser may never be brought to justice			1
@entity9 's former house in @entity14 , which was next door to a drugs den mrs @entity9 today said she had chosen to break her silence after learning @entity30 revealed had handed out 87 cautions in five years for serious sex attacks			1
the grieving mother , from @entity66 , @entity67 , has demanded no other victims should endure the heartache she and her daughter had been left to suffer			1
she said : ' i think children should be protected			2
people need to be protected and they need to be aware			2
' the damage this causes to children lasts a lifetime			2
if he was given a caution what would have stopped him abusing other children ? ' it was never publicly acknowledged he was a danger			2
as the press have said now , it is only when you make these things public that more victims come forwards			2
' an inquest in @entity14 held earlier this year concluded dr @entity28 had in part been driven to her suicide by troublesome neighbours , as part of a narrative verdict			1
' i just want people to understand what she went through and how the abuse affected her life			0
' @entity9 's mother the inquests heard that she lived in fear , was unable to sleep , witnessed drug deals on her doorstep and found hypodermic needles by her home			1
but despite her daughter 's torment mrs @entity9 revealed it was the torment of her sexual abuse , which had been the underlying problem			1
she added : ' it always came back to the abuse			0
we as a family , believed it was the sexual abuse that caused @entity118 's death			0
' her fragility was based on the sex abuse			0
it just never went away fro @entity9			1
she was just a totally innocent child and it ruined her childhood			0
' i just want people to understand what she went through and how the abuse affected her life			0
i cry every day for @entity118			0
she 's my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night			0
' @entity30 had got rid of archived material and taped recordings of the police interview because it was not their policy to keep it on file once they had issued a caution			0
a force spokesman said : ' we can confirm that in april 2011 , @entity30 contacted the mother of a victim who had claimed that a man had been arrested and cautioned in connection with a crime alleged to have taken place in the 1980s			1
' we can also confirm that this approach to the mother was prompted by a call from @entity150 to @entity30 the same month asking @entity151 to investigate			1
' following extensive enquiries , including searching archives and taped interview records held by @entity151 , it was found that the relevant documentation relating to the initial investigation did not exist			0
' it appears this would have been destroyed in accordance with policies regarding cautions that were in place at the time of the original inquiry			0
' he added : ' @entity30 takes reports of sexual offences extremely seriously and they are all investigated			0
' the sexual offences recording category includes a wide range of offences , ranging from the lower level to the more serious , such as a stranger rape			0
' the circumstances in which a caution may be an appropriate outcome may be an inter-familial case , incidents where both the offender and the victim are young children , or consensual sexual activity between those who are underage			0
' however , as with any reported crime the concerns of the victim are always at the forefront of our policing and any investigations that are concluded with a caution are only done so after careful consideration and if it is felt appropriate for all parties concerned			0
' while policies were previously in place where records in relation to cases concluded with cautions were destroyed after three years , new guidelines mean that information is now retained by police			0
