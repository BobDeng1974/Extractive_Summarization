@entity0 has yet to decide whether she will stay with her disgraced husband and her longtime boss @entity2			1
@entity0 has worked for mrs @entity2 for more than 15 years and it is believed that the former first lady gave her an ultimatum , saying that either she ditches husband @entity6 or she will not hold a high office in @entity9 's expected 2016 campaign			1
' @entity2 is horrified by @entity6 , and thinks that he is an embarrassment to his accomplished wife			2
she wants @entity0 to leave him behind			0
but @entity0 is torn between her family and loyalty to @entity2 , ' an unidentified source told the @entity16			2
turning point : @entity0 defended her husband at this july 23 press conference following more revelations about his sexting habits but then she was rarely seen on the trail			0
he went on to lose the race by a massive margin @entity6 's sexting problem first prompted his resignation from @entity27 in 2011 , but it also led to his dramatic downfall in this year 's mayoral primaries			0
sticking together : @entity0 and @entity6 have a son , @entity30 , which will weigh in her decision whether or not to leave the marriage he decided to compete to be the next mayor of @entity35 and @entity0 was largely at his side for the beginning of the campaign			1
she even stood by him and made a public statement defending him when his latest sexting partner @entity42 released transcripts of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent to her			0
the @entity50 were very clear that they were actively staying out of the city 's @entity52 primary race since they had close ties to a number of the candidates - including both @entity6 via @entity57 and the winner @entity58 who helped run @entity9 's senate campaign in 2000			1
while they may have been remaining neutral while @entity6 was in the race , multiple reports have hinted that they are decidedly against @entity6 now that he both embarrassed himself in the polls and @entity0 in the process			0
the unnamed @entity9 source reportedly told @entity66 that if @entity0 chooses to stay with her husband , she will be ' looked after ' and still be given a job with @entity9 's campaign			2
that said , the role would be less high profile than it could be , as many would expect @entity0 to be @entity9 's top campaign manager or chief of staff given how closely they have worked in the past			1
a representative for @entity9 said that the reports of an ultimatum are ' totally false '			0
laying the groundwork : since leaving her post as secretary of state , @entity2 has been ramping up her public appearances which many have seen as her approach towards a @entity86 run @entity0 is one of @entity2 's most trusted advisers and would be expected to be a key part of her team if she enters the 2016 presidential race as for notoriously private @entity0 , actions may be speaking louder than words as she was never seen at her husband 's campaign events following the @entity96 revelations and she was pointedly out of the city on the @entity98			1
she was n't completely out of the loop , however , as she did attend the consolation party that @entity6 held at his brother 's restaurant last week .			0

@entity2 's longtime aide @entity0 is married to former politician @entity6
@entity6 lost his bid to become the next mayor of @entity35 when another woman came *forward* revealing they had a sexting relationship
@entity0 was at his side for much of the campaign but now has retreated and is staying more private
she is thought to be the likely campaign manager and chief of staff for @entity9 should she decide to run for president in 2016
