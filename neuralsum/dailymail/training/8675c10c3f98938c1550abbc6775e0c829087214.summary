by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner in a vast warehouse on the banks of the @entity4 , the @entity1 hosted its most high profile event yet — the unveiling of @entity7 , the superstar billed as the saviour of the @entity1 amid a slew of high profile drop - outs			1
the fastest man in the world will not compete until friday evening and even then , only in the heats of the 4x100 metres relay , but his presence alone is a boost for the @entity1			1
in the absence of @entity18 , who withdrew on thursday — too late for his face to be removed from the promotional material which adorns @entity21 — @entity7 is by far the biggest draw , arguably the only athlete here who transcends the sport			1
his opening address at the dimly lit @entity28 press conference room was as enthusiastically attended as some of the sessions of sport here			1
@entity7 said all the right things , starting with confirmation he would run after weeks of doubt that he would be in shape after suffering a foot injury			1
relaxed : @entity38 's @entity7 jokes with reporters during his press conference at the @entity1 happy to please : @entity7 poses with @entity4 the mascot and children from @entity43 incredulous : @entity7 did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in @entity21 ‘ i have done a lot of training over this past month , ’ he said , ‘ i have been really pushing myself and i am in pretty good shape , but i am not yet in running shape , hence why i am running the heats , just to get a few runs in			1
’ the athletics programme , which gets under way on sunday , needs the star quality he brings			2
@entity7 made his entrance with @entity4 , the @entity1 mascot , and high - fived several local schoolchildren			1
someone tried to present him with a kilt — ‘ red is not my colour , ’ — then some haggis and there were several requests for ‘ selfies ’			2
and that ’s just from reporters			2
the only occasion @entity7 looked troubled in this session was when asked his opinion on the @entity74 conflict			1
he had n’t had a chance to ‘ follow it up , ’ he said , slightly flustered			0
@entity7 , who has eight world titles and six olympic gold medals , has never competed in a @entity1 and will miss the individual sprints again			1
but he denied it had lost its lustre as an event with the absence of @entity83 , suffering from an unspecified illness , and other big stars			0
‘ i do n’t think anybody pulled out on purpose , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s about injuries			0
it happens in the @entity92 and @entity93 , things just go wrong at the last moment			0
it ’s just one of those things			0
there are lot more athletes here and i am sure it ’ll be a good games			0
i am looking forward to watching to see what the level is			0
’ world champ : @entity7 celebrates winning the 4x100m relay at the @entity93 last year smiling @entity7 : the @entity38 sprinter looked in high spirits at his press conference on saturday @entity7 and @entity83 share a major sponsor with the @entity21 2014 organisers , and there have been suggestions he was under pressure to compete for commercial reasons			1
‘ i never try to say it ’s pressure , ’ he said , ‘ i told my coach i wanted to come and he said " right we will make a decision , it depends on how the season is going " , and i got injured and at the end we said we could n’t make it for the trials but let ’s make it for the 4x100m			2
’ @entity7 moved into the athletes ’ village yesterday evening and said he would spend most of his time in his room to avoid requests for photographs and autographs from other competitors			1
he will hope to have more luck with his housemates than @entity92 long jump champion @entity138 , who compared his accommodation to a noisy student flat			0
‘ it ’s like a halls of residence , ’ said @entity138			0
‘ but when you are in professional sport you hope that people respect the fact that you are not about to go out on the lash all day			0
‘ i was actually awake when the noisy b * * * * * * s started this morning but i have heard it is a couple of coaches , my investigations have n’t quite gone as far as getting names but things are going to get sorted out			0
’ unhappy : @entity138 is far from happy with his current living conditions at the @entity1 the first track and field medals will be won on sunday evening in the men ’s and women ’s marathon and the men ’s 5,000m			1
@entity164 ’s @entity163 will run in the 100m heats and has set his sights both on winning a medal and posting his first sub- 10sec time			1
‘ i feel i have been fit enough to do it for a while , weather - permitting , and it would be awesome to do it in front of a @entity175 crowd , ’ said @entity163			0
‘ that would be unbelievable			0
’ he wished @entity177 and his compatriot @entity178 , the second fastest man in the world , were competing in the 100m , even though it gives him more chance of a podium finish			2
‘ if you want to challenge yourself , why not challenge yourself against the quickest man in the world , ’ added @entity163			2
‘ it is lucky i got to race him in @entity189 ( at the @entity93 ) and it is always a shame when he is not at his full fitness to race here			2

@entity194 gave his first press conference after landing on saturday
he says he will definitely run in the 4x100m relay despite *choosing* not to compete in his usual 100m and 200m events
he confirmed he would race in the heats as well as the final , which takes place on *august* 2
@entity7 flew *halfway* around the world to be in @entity21 having missed the 2006 and 2010 competitions through injury
one @entity210 reporter used her question for @entity7 by asking for a selfie
@entity38 posed for pictures with @entity4 the @entity1 mascot and *members* of @entity216
