life expectancy is measured by linking factors such as smoking , eating habits and socio - economic background			1

everyone approaching retirement will be told when they are expected to die , ministers have said			0
the government - backed guidance came as figures from the @entity12 revealed a growing life expectancy gap between @entity14 life expectancy at age 65 was highest for men in @entity22 , where they could expect to live for a further 20.9 years compared with only 14.9 years for men in @entity24			1
for women at age 65 , life expectancy was highest in @entity28 ( 23.8 years ) and lowest in @entity24 ( 18.3 years )			1
average male life expectancy in the @entity30 is now 78.9 years			1
the coast of @entity32 is the longevity capital of @entity30 , with girls born in the @entity36 area expected to live to 86.6 years			1
the neighbouring district of @entity32 has the highest male life expectancy at 82.9 years			1
mr @entity39 said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes , lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors the guidance is designed to help pensioners plan how much to spend and save			1
@entity39 , the @entity51 , said retirees need to gain a sense of how long they might live to help make such financial decisions			1
he said many people underestimate how long they will live			2
‘ if you are thinking about this , what do you do ? for best guidance you probably think about how long your grandparents lived			2
but that is two generations out of date			0
’ the minister is asking pension providers to give people an estimate as part of guidance which will be rolled out in april next year			2
the advice is linked to major pension reforms , announced in the @entity72 , which will allow people to draw down their money at any time , instead of seeing it tied up in annuities			0
that led to warnings that people might be reckless , blowing their pension pots on expensive items instead of saving sensibly to last them throughout retirement			0
at the time mr @entity39 hit back , saying he was ‘ relaxed ’ if people wanted to buy @entity87 @entity86 sports cars because that was their ‘ choice ’			0
mr @entity39 said for most people , their life expectancy will be ' much longer than they think ' but the @entity91 also admitted that ‘ consumers need to be able to make informed decisions ’			1
it is therefore guaranteeing ‘ free , impartial face - to - face guidance ’ for individuals reaching retirement through a new ‘ duty ’ on pension providers to deliver the advice			2
mr @entity39 said the type of questions that would be covered included asking people about their household , such as whether they have a spouse , what might happen if they died and if they had thought about residential care			0
but life expectancy also had to be part of that consultation			1
mr @entity39 said insurance companies already had some of the mechanisms to calculate the figure using information such as postcodes , lifestyle choices like smoking and hereditary factors			2
‘ it is an average , ’ added mr @entity39			0
‘ but for most people it will probably be longer than they think			0
’ figures from the @entity12 show the @entity125 in life expectancy is widening because of the migration of young people with healthy lifestyles to the south - east			1
ambitious young and fit people are increasingly being drawn away from northern areas in search of higher paid jobs around @entity134 , according to the @entity12			0
overall life expectancy is rising steadily across @entity30 – with women now projected to live to 82.7 years – a year longer than they were only four years ago			1
although men are still behind women , they are narrowing the gap rapidly , gaining almost 17 months in the last four years alone			1
noting how death rates are higher in northern @entity142 than the south , the @entity12 report said : ‘ a number of factors have been identified as plausibly being responsible for the excess mortality in the northern regions of @entity142			2
‘ these include socioeconomic , environmental , educational , lifestyle factors , which may act over the whole life course , and possibly over generations			2
’ it added : ‘ one factor that has received less attention is the selective migration of healthy individuals from poorer health areas into better health areas or vice versa			0
’ @entity160 of the @entity161 told @entity162 : ' i think people will either laugh at this idea or be very upset by it			0
it ’s crude , blunt and a bit gimmicky			0
' if you were told you were going to live to 98 , you ’d probably think , ‘ that ’s all right ’ , but if you only made it to 78 , you ’d be upset			0
