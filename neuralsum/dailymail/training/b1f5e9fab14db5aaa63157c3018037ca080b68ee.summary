by @entity0 @entity2 former prime minister @entity1 , released from jail last month after her rival @entity4 fled from power , announced today that said she would run again for president in an election on may 25			1
she also pledged to build a strong army and said she hoped to be able to recover @entity10 from @entity11 , which annexed it last week			1
the announcement by the flamboyant @entity1 set up a contest with boxer - turned - politician @entity15 , who has also declared his candidacy , and other figures who have emerged to contend for top posts after four months of political turmoil			1
' none of the politicians understand the depth of lawlessness ( in the country ) and nobody wants to end it as desperately as i do , ' she said			1
@entity1 , 53 , a powerful speaker known in her heyday for her trademark peasant hair - braid , served twice as prime minister and ran for president in 2010 , only to be narrowly beaten in a run - off vote by @entity4			1
' i plan to run for president , ' she told her first news conference since being released from jail a month ago ' none of the politicians understand the depth of lawlessness ( in the country ) and nobody wants to end it as desperately as i do , ' she said @entity4 , her nemesis , subsequently launched a campaign against her and her allies , and she was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office linked to a gas deal she brokered with @entity11 in 2009			1
she served two years of a seven - year term , mainly under prison guard in a hospital in @entity62 , before being released when @entity4 fled on feb. 20 and was subsequently ousted by parliament			2
she was wildly popular at the height of her power 10 years ago when she led tens of thousands on the streets of @entity67 against an earlier bid for power by @entity4 in what became known as the @entity71			2
but though there was sympathy from many people for her plight during her incarceration , many take the view that she was divisive and headstrong when in power			2
her time as prime minister was marked by infighting between her and then president @entity82 which doomed the record of the ' orange ' order in office and allowed @entity4 to return to power			0
@entity1 , 53 , a powerful speaker known in her heyday for her trademark peasant hair - braid , served twice as prime minister and ran for president in 2010 , only to be narrowly beaten in a run - off vote by @entity4 when she was brought to the ' @entity93 ' - @entity93 - in late february to face the tens of thousands who had forced @entity4 out after three months of violent turmoil in which more than 100 people had been killed , she met with a mixed response from people disenchanted with the political class as a whole			1
recent opinion polls measuring people 's trust in today 's leaders show her well behind @entity15 , a former world heavyweight boxer who has declared his intention to run , and confectionary oligarch @entity107 , an early and influential supporter of the ' @entity93 ' revolt who has yet to declare his intentions			1
@entity1 appears now to have decided to re-brand herself possibly in an attempt to distance herself from an old image which could be used against her in the coming campaign			2
on thursday she eschewed her hair - braid and was carrying a stick , a reminder of the back trouble that plagued her in prison and for which she has had treatment in @entity120 since being released			2

@entity11 president @entity128 chairs a meeting with members of the @entity131 at the @entity133 state residence outside @entity134 today president @entity128 warned the @entity136 on thursday that curbing @entity11 ' use of payment systems based in the @entity139 and @entity140 would backfire by causing companies involved to lose money and market share and she went on to argue that , as someone born in the industrial east of the country , she was particularly suited to build a bridge with @entity11 - speakers there , many of whom are unhappy over the way @entity4 was forced out of power			2
' i can find words and arguments for my mother and that means for those who represent the east and live in the east , ' she said			0

' @entity170 added that he believed @entity2 's new government was committed to economic reforms			0

' the @entity2 authorities have voiced publicly and privately a keen interest in getting their economic house in order			0
' the @entity165 's two most recent programs with @entity2 went off track because of the previous governments ' failure to follow through with politically difficult measures such as raising gas prices , which the @entity165 said was necessary to put the government 's finances in order			0
but @entity67 on wednesday said it would raise the price of energy for domestic consumers by more than 50 percent from may 1 , seen as a gesture to secure the @entity165 package			0
