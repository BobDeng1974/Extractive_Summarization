he told @entity34 : ' we 've had quite a few phone calls and letters off cranks saying i 'm a murderer , that it should be me that 's clubbed to death because they 're saying it 's a coypu			2
' i know the difference between a rat and a coypu , because i 've lived in the country most of my life and it 's vermin , and vermin should be destroyed			2
' rats carry diseases , that 's why they get killed , so you crankers out there , do n't waste my time and do n't waste your own time			0
