by @entity0 published : 05:04 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 14 august 2013 soft drinks giant @entity1 has accused a little - known @entity3 microbrewery of infringing its trademark and has demanded it change its name			1
the energy drinks firm has sent @entity8 - based @entity7 - which only started trading in october and employs just eight staff - a threatening letter insisting it could not use the word ' red ' because it owned the trademark			1
the @entity14 company also objected to the second part of the name ' well ' because it ends with the same two letters as ' bull '			0
finance director @entity25 said : ' it 's quite worrying			2
the reason for their response to our trademark is ridiculous really			2
' their stance is completely unfair and unreasonable			0
it 's quite concerning when you 've got a massive company trying to get you to do something you should n't have to do			2
' our brands are completely different and we 're not trying to infringe their brand in any way			0
' newcomer : the brewery only started trading in october the trouble flared up about two months ago when @entity30 applied to trademark its name			0
@entity1 was alerted to the matter and brand enforcement manager @entity57 wrote to the owners of the small brewery in @entity60 near @entity61 ordering them to withdraw the application			1
in the letter , mr @entity57 , accused @entity30 's application of compromising @entity1 's earlier trademark ' red ' which would confuse the public			1
his letter read : ' furthermore the term " bull " and the term " well " share the same ending and just differ in two letters			0
' the ending " ll " is identical and therefore the terms @entity1 and @entity30 are confusingly similar from a visual as well from a phonetical point of view			2
' he added : ' consumers ... will easily consider the sign " @entity80 " as a line extension under " @entity1 " , in particular that the goods and services offered under " @entity80 " and " @entity1 " are coming from the same undertaking			1
' the consumer will thus be confused as to the origin of the services			0
' threatening legal action unless @entity30 obeyed its demand , mr @entity57 argued that the trademark would ' take unfair advantage of , dilute and tarnish the @entity1 trademarks '			1
@entity7 was founded by directors @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity23			0
and they have vowed to fight the global firm , saying they have already ratcheted up ' thousands of pounds ' in legal fees			1
mr @entity25 said : ' we called ourselves @entity30 after @entity99 in @entity8			0
it was not just some random name we picked out of thin air			0
cheers : mr @entity25 and ms @entity23 raise a glass despite legal worries brought on by global giant @entity1 ' @entity24 and @entity23 are part - owners of the @entity107 in @entity99 , and our beers are sold there			1
' the name of @entity1 never came up at all when we were discussing what to call the brewery			1
i can not see that there would be any confusion between @entity1 and @entity30			2
' for a start , @entity1 is two words and @entity30 is one , and then the second words are different			2
we are different names , brands , designs and products			0
' mr @entity25 explained after some initial legal wrangling , @entity1 agreed to let them keep using the name @entity30 on its existing products , but demanded any new lines it introduces and branding such as t - shirts be given a different name			1
what 's in a name : the firm are refusing to rebrand and say they have already clocked up thousands of pounds in legal fees he added : ' a lot of hard work has gone into developing our brand			1
the design on our bottles and other merchandise was created by third year graphic designers at @entity143			0
' it would be catastrophic for us now to have to go back to the drawing board to find another name			0
' mr @entity24 said : ' it seems like an over-the - top reaction			0
as a small , innovative brewery , it 's quite worrying to have this thing hanging over our heads , when we are looking to move the business forward			2
@entity30 supplies craft beer to pubs in @entity8 and @entity157 and is expanding to sell across the country to @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
it produces 3,000 litres of beer every week , has been selling beer for about five months , and employs eight people			0
confusion : @entity30 say @entity1 never even crossed their minds when they were devising their name , and their name was taken from the street where they also run a pub it claims to be the first brewery to brew its own lager in @entity8 for more than 30 years			1
founded in 1984 , @entity1 employed 8,966 people in 165 countries by the end of last year as its top product rules and dominates the global energy drinks industry			1
mr @entity25 said they had now replied to @entity1 's request and were trying hard to find a reasonable solution without giving up their name			1
a @entity1 spokesman said the company did not comment on pending cases .			2

@entity1 has demanded a tiny brewery called @entity80 change its name
the global giant trademarked the word ' red ' and has cried infringement
but the brewery is fighting back and branded @entity1 's claim ' ridiculous '
they say they have already spent ' thousands of pounds ' in legal fees
