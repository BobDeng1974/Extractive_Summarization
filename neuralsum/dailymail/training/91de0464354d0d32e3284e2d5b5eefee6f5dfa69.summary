he said he intended to relax ahead of @entity1 next week			1
and reigning champion @entity2 looked like he was staying true to his word as he and girlfriend @entity4 dressed down to take their border terriers @entity5 and @entity8 for a walk in the countryside			1
the @entity11 will defend his title at the championships , which start a week today , under the guidance of new coach @entity15			1
@entity2 , who 12 months ago became the first @entity17 man to win a wimbledon singles title in 77 years , was left with some unexpected spare time after losing in the third round at @entity20 ’s last week			1
animal lovers : @entity2 and @entity4 taking their dogs @entity8 and @entity5 for a walk close to their £ 5 million home in @entity27 the couple looked like any other enjoying the countryside on a balmy day near their £ 5million mansion in @entity32 , @entity27 , as they took the @entity34 for a walk last friday			1
the pair , who were both dressed - down in t - shirts , trainers and shorts , then piled into a grey @entity43 worth about £ 25,000			1
it is a reasonable sum to spend on a car in comparison to his previous purchases			2
in 2012 , he was seen driving a silver £ 85,000 @entity52 convertible through south - west @entity53			2
it replaced the grey @entity55 he bought in 2011 for up to £ 135,000			2
and that replaced the red @entity58 he bought before that			0
he admitted that the @entity58 was a ‘ too flash ’ at the time and said he felt like a ‘ prat ’ driving it , adding : ‘ i ’m quite a conservative driver , but when i was driving that you ’d get beeped for getting out of the car			0
’ despite being knocked out of the competition in the third round , @entity2 returned to @entity69 yesterday for the @entity71 exhibition match now , it looks like he has made a much more sensible choice and the decision implies that the 27 - year - old may be growing up			1
he even let his girlfriend of nine years drive him home in a sign he ’s settling down to domestic bliss in the home they share			2
discussing his choice of vehicle previously , he said that miss @entity83 usually drives a @entity85			0
he also admitted that he sometimes prefers to go undercover by riding about in the small @entity86 he bought when he passed his driving test			0
‘ we had a @entity90 which i used to drive and an @entity55 , ’ he told the @entity88			0
‘ i sold the @entity55 and we changed the @entity90 for a @entity85 , i do n’t really drive that much - my girlfriend drives that			2
‘ the only other car i have got is a @entity86 , which is my first car which i have still got			0
i had it when i passed my test at 21			0
following the frustration of his exit at @entity69 last week , @entity2 said he planned to relax and catch up with friends ahead of the start of the defence of his @entity1 title ‘ i drove that to @entity1 last year [ 2012 ]			1
it is still the car i drive most in			0
are people surprised when they see my get out of it ? ‘ i do n’t think many people look to be honest if it ’s a @entity86			0
is it sentimentality ? it ’s not something i ’ve thought much about it			0
‘ the reason i kept it is because if people come to stay , it ’s a good car to pick people up from the station and those sort of things			0
because it is my first car , i have kept it - it ’s done about 30,000 miles now			0
’ last week , as he casually strolled along a country lane , the @entity1 champion wore a blue t - shirt with trainers emblazoned on it and a pair of trainers designed by @entity125 , which is one of his sponsors			1
mr @entity2 , who won @entity129 gold at @entity130 , has a £ 15million five - year deal with the sportswear giant			1
following his @entity20 ’s defeat , he said he planned to relax , catch up with friends and watch the @entity135 - and he was obviously telling the truth given their romantic stroll .			1
