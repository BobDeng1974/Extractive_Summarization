@entity0 claimed his @entity2 title triumph stands him in good stead for upcoming challenges after he fended off five match points to beat @entity6			1
in a match which swung first one way and then the other , the @entity7 eventually won 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 9/7 ) 7 - 6 ( 10/8 ) claiming the final set on a tie - break against his @entity13 opponent			1
the victory is a massive step for @entity0 in qualifying for the @entity16 as he moved up to fifth in the race to @entity19 standings with ninth place enough to qualify			1
even if he was to lose his opening match , all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season - ending finale in @entity19 : ' i know it was an incredible match , ' @entity0 told atpworldtour.com			2
' the tennis at the end and in the second set was high level			0
i played well at the right moments			0
' i do n't know how i managed to come through it - i was very tired , @entity45 was very tired as well			0
' when you have to work hard for something it means more , you get more satisfaction from it			0
' i kept fighting and it stands me in good stead for the end of this year and the beginning of next			0
' @entity0 had also saved five match points against @entity6 when he won the @entity58 title in southern @entity59 last month			1
this match was equally exhausting , lasting three hours and 20 minutes - the longest final on the @entity16 world tour this year - and at the end @entity6 appeared to make a jokey obscene gesture at his opponent			1
it was the 31st title of @entity0 's career and was further demonstration that he is back on track - @entity69 was his first title victory in 14 months			2

it was much tighter in the second set but in the tie - break @entity6 had two points to win the title but @entity0 produced some battling heroics to hold on and then take the set himself , winning the tie - break 9 - 7			1
it looked equally dicey for @entity0 when @entity6 broke serve to take a 4 - 3 lead in the final set but the @entity7 drew on reserves of energy to break back immediately to level the match			1
it was @entity6 's turn then to rescue a match point against him and take the final set to a tie - break , with both players looking to be on their last legs			2
the 32 - year - old @entity117 saw three more match points come and go before he netted to give @entity119 the chance of victory and he made no mistake with a backhand winner after a fierce final rally			1
@entity6 looks fired up as he pushes @entity119 all the way in a tight three - set @entity2 final a general view of the stunning @entity25 building as @entity0 takes on @entity6 for the title in @entity2 it was a heartbreaking defeat for @entity117 @entity6 who failed to capitalise on five match points against @entity0 in front of his home fans			1
it was the second time in a month that the @entity83 no 1 saved five match points against @entity6 , the last time being in the final of the @entity58 on september 28			1
and this time a shattered @entity6 reacted with a light - hearted double middle finger salute			2
