by @entity0 @entity1 : 21:01 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:05 est , 30 december 2013 more than 100 secret documents detailing the private discussions between @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 before the @entity9 war are set to be declassified and published			1
the @entity10 has learned senior civil servants are ‘ close ’ to a deal to let the @entity13 into the war publish the documents after more than a year of wrangling			1
records of telephone conversations between mr @entity5 and mr @entity7 , notes between the two men and even papers documenting @entity21 discussions on the war are expected to be released to the public			1
private notes : @entity7 and @entity5 in february 2001 senior @entity26 sources say that the papers are likely to be published within three months - clearing the way for the publication of the report , nearly five years after sir @entity24 began his inquiries			1
sir @entity24 has repeatedly complained that he has been prevented from publishing his conclusions because cabinet secretary sir @entity34 was blocking publication of the key papers on which his judgments were based			0
last month sir @entity24 wrote to @entity38 to say the @entity41 had ‘ not reached a final position ’ on whether to release the requested documents			2
but a senior @entity43 source has now revealed that sir @entity34 intends to release as many papers as possible , in contrast to his predecessor sir @entity47 , who counselled against publishing any of the @entity21 discussions or private notes between prime ministers and mr @entity7			1
the source said yesterday that ‘ good progress ’ had been made towards declassifying many of the records and added : ‘ there will be a lot more than people were expecting			2
’ some of the contents of the documents will be blacked out for national security reasons and to prevent @entity61 and @entity62 relations being damaged			2
release : telephone records , notes and even documents from @entity21 discussions are to be made public however , the source said : ‘ there is an ongoing process of declassification , which is attempting to strike a balance to ensure you are not setting a legal precedent that could oblige you to publish other documents in the future or damage national security			1
‘ there are likely to be some redactions - but only where absolutely necessary			0
the intention is to be transparent			0
’ the documents at issue include up to 200 cabinet - level discussions on the @entity9 war , notes sent between mr @entity5 and mr @entity7 , and more than 130 records of conversations between either mr @entity5 or mr @entity6 and the @entity89			1
@entity5 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the inquiry of course had full access to all documents , including all the confidential correspondence between president @entity7 and then prime minister , mr @entity5			2
‘ in addition , mr @entity5 agreed at the last inquiry hearing to answer questions in a way that specifically revealed the contents of the correspondence on the issues that interested the inquiry			0
’ but mr @entity5 told sir @entity24 : ‘ i think it is extremely important that the @entity62 prime minister and the @entity61 president are able to communicate in confidence , and if something is given in confidence it should be treated like that , but i am very happy to tell you the basis of what i said			0
’ a @entity41 spokesman said : ‘ the government is currently engaged in discussions with the inquiry , which the inquiry recognises raises difficult issues , including legal and international relations issues			0
‘ these issues are being worked through in good faith and with a view to reaching a position as rapidly as possible			0
‘ the inquiry should be allowed to publish its findings and we should not pre-empt the content of the report			0

the @entity10 has learned civil servants are ‘ close ’ to a deal to allow publication
documents will include telephone records and private notes
