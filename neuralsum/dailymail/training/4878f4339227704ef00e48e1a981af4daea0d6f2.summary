the catadores , as they 're known , of the @entity13 cooperative in the city of @entity15 spend their days sifting through piles of old , discarded material			1
with the help of local artists and volunteers , they then transform the junk they find into furniture , jewelry or works of art. trash to treasure : a catadore sifts through the trash at the @entity32 landfill site in @entity33 jewels : the necklace and earring combination , left , has been fashioned from disused lighting and wire while the one pictured right uses artificial roses ' i have two jobs , ' collector @entity41 , 39 , told @entity44 in its documentary @entity45 to @entity6			1
' i go and collect the trash and then i transform it into art. i make small sofas , wooden benches , tables , and other plastic adornments			0
' he added : ' we have a phrase : ' o seu @entity56 , ' roughly translated as " your trash is our luxury			0
" ' according to @entity44 , catadores are a common sight not just in @entity15 but in cities and towns all across @entity6			2
a 2010 estimate suggested there were roughly one million catadores in the country though only a small number are affiliated with a cooperative or organized group			2
teamwork : the artists and catadores of the @entity13 cooperative pose together in the @entity6 city of @entity15 all sorts : @entity80 , cans , bottles and other recyclable objects are all turned into art or jewelry and sold the people - often formerly homeless or ex-convicts - search for cans , bottles , metals and other recyclable materials in the street trash			1
but the living they can earn has dwindled over the years			0
to help them out , groups like @entity13 teach the workers how to transform the recyclable trash they collect into art or other useful items			1
all the treasures the trash collectors create at the organization are sold at a nearby shop and the profits are divided evenly among the catadores			1
with the art sales and their usual income from collecting recyclables , a catadore affiliated with @entity13 earns around 1,700 @entity107 or $ 800 @entity108 dollars a month - a respectable wage			2
recyclables : some one million catadores sift through trash for recyclables in cities across @entity6 homeless : many of @entity13 's workers are the formerly homeless or ex-convicts ' the art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own carts , and then for the catadores ' children to learn how to make crafts and other art pieces with the material collected , ' @entity13 founder and president @entity118 told @entity44			1
@entity129 , an artist who heads the @entity13 creative program , says helping catadores to produce art also encourages other citizens to see them in a more positive light			2
' in @entity6 the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin , ' @entity129 told @entity44			0
' therefore , linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility			0
' he said the program also promoted recycling and helped people rethink what is trash and what is n't .			0
