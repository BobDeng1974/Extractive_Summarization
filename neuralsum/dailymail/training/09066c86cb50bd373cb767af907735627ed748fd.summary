it is a tradition going back 150 years , with hardened swimmers jumping into the sea at @entity3 on a crisp @entity4			1
but @entity3 and @entity5 has decided it will close the beach on christmas day over ' safety fears ' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago			1
@entity14 agreed to follow the council 's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years			1
' the council said it had decided to close the beach after fears over the safety of people getting into the water on christmas day			1
an experienced male swimmer had to be rescued in october and a spokesman said they were concerned a similar thing could happen during the festive swim			1
also in 2012 a woman died during a similar swim in @entity57 and a year earlier a man had to be rescued			2
seafront manager @entity59 added : ' @entity60 takes skill , stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced , using suitable wetsuits , in very calm conditions and with a friend			0
' even on a calm day sea currents , undertow or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning			2
' even experienced swimmers can get caught out			2
' the cancellation ends a 150 year tradition for @entity14			1
@entity78 , sea swimming coach at the club , said it was a shame for club members but necessary to ensure people 's safety as the event had become so large and unwieldy it was dangerous			1
in 2011 dozens of swimmers turned up at @entity3 for the swim and a man had to be rescued in 2009 a team of @entity89 took part in the swim , but fancy dress can make it dangerous for the inexperienced she said there are no lifeguards on the beach on @entity4 and it was impossible to rely on the swimming club and the @entity100 to look after thousands of people who lack understanding of the tides and risks of swimming in such cold temperatures			1
she said : ' it 's become unsafe			0
we have an @entity109 sea that people have to get into by jumping off a shelf			0
people are not aware of the environment and dangers			0
' @entity115 was one of the biggest problems we had and the event just became unmanageable			0
it went from being a club - only swim to a massive public			2
' when it started there were about 30 people in our club taking part			0
in 2008 a @entity4 day swimmer is pictured in full @entity131 outfit taking part in the swim in freezing waters ' but our club basically became responsible for looking after 4,000 ridiculous people in costumes who were throwing themselves in the sea after drinking alcohol			1
' ms @entity78 was one of the people who rescued a man taking part in the event three years ago , who had been drinking heavily the night before and had come in fancy dress - which can often restrict swimmers once they are in the water			1
she added : ' the biggest turnout we ever had was when we nearly lost a member of the public			0
i and three other club members had to go in and save this man			0
that was really the end of the line			0
' we fully support the council			0
we are sad that we 've had to stop a 150 year tradition but we fully support this for health and safety reasons			2
' last year as the south of @entity163 was battered by heavy rain and storms @entity3 and @entity161 also closed the @entity29 in a bid to stop people venturing into the sea			1
members of @entity14 , pictured in 2002 , will not be able to take part in the swim after the club cancelled the event because it has become dangerous with too many inexperienced people turning up @entity14 said people have been turning up without knowledge of the dangers of swimming in cold waters and often after a heavy night 's drinking , putting themselves in danger once they get in the sea ms @entity78 added : ' we supported this action by the council			1
what we do is pretty extreme and specialised			0
we ca n't be seen as a bad example and encouraging the normal public to think it 's ok to do what we do			0
' she said it was especially dangerous at @entity3 because the pier is shelved - meaning people have to drive straight into the freezing waters to take part			2
at beaches like in @entity199 , where the @entity4 swim is still due to take place this year , the risks are much lower as people are able to walk into the sea from the wide beach			1
last year dozens of swimmers braved the cold to swim in the @entity206 in @entity207 for the @entity208 @entity209 said the popular @entity4 swim would be going ahead as planned this year @entity206 swimming club , based in @entity207 , is also going ahead with an annual @entity4 swim this year			1
it will be the 150th anniversary of the event , which begins at 9am as swimmers compete for the @entity208			0
author @entity215 became associated with the @entity4 race in 1903 and donated the first cup for the winner			2
the traditional @entity222 swim , this year with a @entity220 theme , will also take place on @entity224 in @entity225 .			0
