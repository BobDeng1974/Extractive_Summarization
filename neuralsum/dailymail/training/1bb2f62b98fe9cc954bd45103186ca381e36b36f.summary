by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 08:11 est , 14 january 2014 these astonishing images may look like stills from @entity5 ’s sci - fi special effects spectacular @entity6 - but they are actually long exposures of fireflies here on @entity8			2
the stunning snaps show thousands of the luminous creatures taking flight in a forested area			1
the incredible photos are the work of @entity15 , 28 , from @entity16 , @entity17			1
way to glow : one of mr @entity15 's amazing photos light fantastic : the clever photography makes it look like the forest floor is covered with glowing spaghetti he took them in the @entity28 , @entity29 , and @entity17 ’s @entity31 and @entity30			1
he used a time - lapse technique to capture the shots , leaving his camera stationary on a tripod , with a shutter remote ensuring the camera stayed perfectly still			2
he said : ‘ i 'm inspired by the element of surprise which is why i 'm compelled towards long exposure photography			2
‘ the shot that got me hooked was back in 2007 when i went camping on @entity42 in @entity17			1
in this image the fireflies mimic the array of stars in the night sky above illuminating experience : the forest is lit up by the darting fireflies ‘ there was a forest fire off on the horizon so i decided to take a 30 second exposure and during that time lightning struck unexpectedly in the center of the frame			0
‘ the tripod sank during the exposure and i lost the image but after i saw what came out on the lcd screen i was in love ! ‘ it ’s that element of surprise paired with having the ability to , in a way , manipulate time that has always pressed me to keep experimenting			0
’ capture the images @entity71 used a @entity73 camera , @entity75 14 - 24mm f / 2.8 lens and a timer remote			0
fireflies are actually winged beetles and they produce bioluminescence to snare prey and lure mates			0
there are around 2,000 species worldwide that glow yellow , green or pale red .			0
