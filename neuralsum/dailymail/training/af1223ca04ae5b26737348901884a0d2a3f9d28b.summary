by @entity0 a foreign businessman who bombarded @entity2 with 500,000 spam text messages a day has been convicted after being exposed by a @entity4 on sunday undercover investigation			1
but @entity6 , 43 , has escaped with just a £ 4,000 fine – and investigators say he may still be plaguing mobile phone users with unsolicited texts and nuisance calls			1
@entity6 , who runs a call centre business based in @entity12 , was revealed to be behind thousands of spam messages inviting people to claim compensation for mis - sold payment protection insurance ( @entity17 ) in december 2012			1
he was prosecuted for breaching the @entity18 at a trial in may			2
judgment was reserved to a hearing last week at @entity22 in @entity23 , when @entity6 was found guilty and fined			2
he did not attend the hearing			0
@entity6 was found guilty of being a @entity17 text spammer after being exposed by the @entity26 for allegedly bombarding people with half a million spam messages a day @entity6 had tried to argue at the trial in may that @entity2 law did not apply to him because he operated out of @entity12			1
but a district judge ruled that @entity6 did have to obey @entity2 laws because he came here touting for business			1
however , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) admits it does not know whether @entity6 is still sending spam texts and nuisance calls – although the ruling means they can continue to investigate him			2
the @entity33 ’s @entity38 said : ‘ @entity6 can not just sit in @entity12 and say , “ i am going to generate all these calls to the @entity2 and nothing is going to happen			1
” ‘ @entity6 made it quite clear he came to the @entity2 to speak to clients			1
as far as we are aware , he ’s still operating			0
‘ it ’s difficult to say whether he ’s still doing it because he does not identify who he is when he ’s making calls or who the [ text message ] sender is			0
‘ the options for us are to review whatever evidence we have in relation to his business operations based in the @entity2			1
’ @entity6 is chief executive of his it company @entity56 ( @entity58 ) , based in the @entity12 city of @entity60 , 90 miles east of @entity61			1
vintels closed down its website last week but @entity6 is still registered with @entity2 authorities as someone who handles the personal data of @entity2			1
it was on one of his trips to the @entity2 in december 2012 that @entity6 boasted to an undercover @entity26 reporter how his firm had sent huge numbers of messages telling people they were entitled to free refunds on the @entity17 policies they had taken out			2
this woman looks pleased to receive a text so it probably is not a spam from @entity6 's company anyone who responded to the texts was seen as a ‘ lead ’ , and their mobile number was sold to a claims management company for up to £ 7.50			2
@entity6 told our reporter he had made millions of pounds out of his business , and claimed he was immune from prosecution as it operated from outside the @entity2			1
but he tangled himself up with red tape			0
anyone selling debt leads in the @entity2 has to have a consumer credit licence and @entity6 obeyed that rule			2
he also registered as a ‘ data controller ’ with the @entity33			0
but he failed to declare the true nature of his business on the register – that of ‘ lead generating ’ or selling and using people ’s phone numbers for marketing – and it was on that breach he was found guilty			0
the judge decided he could not argue that @entity2 laws did not apply to him because his operation was abroad as he had a @entity2 consumer credit licence			0
district judge @entity111 said : ‘ i ’m dealing with a failure to keep his entry up to date			0
i ’m not dealing with his company ’s sending millions of unsolicited text messages to people in this country			0
’ @entity6 provided no explanation why he was not present or represented , and in his absence was fined £ 4,000 for the breach , ordered to pay £ 2,703 costs and a £ 400 victim surcharge within 28 days or a warrant can be issued for his arrest			0
the @entity2 authorities have found it almost impossible to get to the bottom of @entity6 ’s operations because he does not have a base here – he used to sleep on his sister ’s sofa in @entity23 when he came to the @entity2 touting for business			1
after the case , one of @entity6 ’s victims , wholesale firm boss @entity136 , 51 , from @entity138 in @entity139 , said : ‘ it ’s a victory but it does not stop it			0
i think @entity6 has got off lightly			0
he should have got a bigger fine			0

@entity6 , 43 , fined just for breaching @entity18
bombarded @entity2 with half a million texts a day
@entity6 runs a call centre business in @entity12 and claimed he was exempt from @entity151 and @entity152 law because he was based abroad
