if the mysterious underwater world was n't already fascinating enough , a diver has captured various fish , crabs , shrimps and coral inhabitants of the @entity7 oceans like never before			1
underwater photographer @entity8 used a standard dslr camera in an underwater housing , along with external flash strobes to create the surreal effect			1
his stunning images show the flora and fauna that live off the coasts of @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19 illuminated in bright colours shining like aliens submerged in the deep waters			1
@entity24 - based underwater photographer @entity8 took these ultraviolet images of underwater creatures as he travelled across @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19			1
he used external flash strobes to illuminate the underwater flora and fauna and , to create the glowing effect , also filmed the marine life using filters and fluorescent lighting			1
this image shows a golden mantis shrimp this image shows a spearing mantis shrimp			0
mantis shrimps have excellent sight with eyes mounted on stalks that provide almost 360 ° vision when diving with a fluorescent mask the diver said he was blown away by the psychedelic colours and immediately wanted to capture the effect on camera			1
the 39 - year - old , from @entity24 , took the photos at @entity51 , @entity17 , the @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity18 and @entity54 in the @entity19			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i enjoy fluorescent photography as it 's a bit different from normal underwater photos			1
' when diving the same area repetitively and seeing the same creatures , it makes things more interesting			0
‘ not too many people have done fluorescent photography well , so it 's quite unique and more of a challenge			2
‘ my camera is a standard dslr in an underwater housing with external strobes - but you need excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect and then @entity74 over the lens to strip away the excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence			1
‘ you also need a fluorescent light to be able to see the fluorescent in the first place and a yellow barrier filter over your mask , which performs the same task as on the camera but for your eyes			1
’ in one image , @entity8 captured a hydroid decorator crab clinging to the side of coral			1
small decorator crabs are often found with stingers on the top of their heads to deter predators			0
decorator crabs have also been known to snap off small branches and hook them onto their shells for camouflage and defense			0
another shot shows a freckled frogfish			0
frogfish are masters of camouflage and change to match their surroundings			0
a stalk between their eyes mimics the movement of other smaller fish and is used to lure in the frogfish 's prey			0
their mouths open and expand to the width of their bodies to easily devour their prey			0

their mouths open and expand to the width of their bodies to easily devour their prey			0
the dusky nebrotha , pictured right , is a member of the @entity157 family			1
it is found either on its own , or as part of a pair on coral and rocky reefs , particularly in sand and rubble in this shot , @entity165 managed to capture the juvenile raggy scorpionfish			1
although @entity8 used red lights to illuminate this fish , adults are best recognised by the tiny light - blue ' eyes ' , or ocelli cells , scattered across their bodies , as well dark triangles below the eyes			1
small juveniles have three distinctive white spots along the back and the species typically lives in coastal reefs , often where the fish can be well camouflaged in areas of algae and seagrass			0
the spines pictured along the bag are venomous while the dusky nebrotha , which looks like a cut out on a @entity189 pumpkin in @entity8 's photos , is a member of the @entity157 family			1
it is found either on its own , or as part of a pair on coral and rocky reefs , particularly in sand and rubble			2
@entity157 are slow moving creatures that swim using either muscular contractions , or by the millions of tiny hairs they have on their ' feet '			0
@entity157 lay their eggs in a ribbon effect on the sand , and each species produces a slightly different colour egg			2
among @entity8 's images is also a @entity206 , known as the orangutan crab			1
it has relatively long arms that are thickly covered with fine hairs that are reddish brown in colour , similar to its mammal namesake			0
these two images show mushroom coral from a distance , left , and close up , right			1
this type of coral varies in shape and colour and the species is generally solitary and can often appear bleached or dead			2
mushroom corals are able to change sex in response to environmental changes this image is of the @entity206 , also known as the orangutan crab			1
it has relatively long arms , which are thickly covered with fine hairs that are reddish brown in colour , similar to its mammal namesake			0
these hairs collect debris to help camouflage it further and it hangs from underwater plants brain coral , pictured , is the name given to the @entity240 family because its surface and grooves resemble that of the brain			1
each head of the coral is formed by a colony of genetically identical polyps that release a hard skeleton of calcium carbonate			2
brain corals are found in shallow warm water and use their tentacles to catch food at night			0
during the day , these tentacles are used for protection the fimbriated moray , pictured , is a moray eel found in the @entity7 oceans , around reefs and harbours			1
it is often founds at depths of 147ft ( 45 metres )			0
it is pale green - yellow in colour and has black spots on its face			0
the eel can can reach a maximum length of 31 inches ( 80 cm ) @entity8 used standard dslr in an underwater housing to take these shots			1
he fitted it with external strobes , as well as so - called excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect			1
additionally , a @entity74 filters was placed over the lens to strip away any excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence			1

small juveniles have three distinctive white spots along the back and the species typically lives in coastal reefs , often where the fish can be well camouflaged in areas of algae and seagrass			0

a number of corals were also captured by @entity8 during his travels			2
two images show mushroom coral - one from a distance and a second close up			2

the torch coral , pictured left , is often known as trumpet coral or pom - pom coral			1
it is brown or green and has yellow tips on its tentacles			0
the yellow will sometimes appear to glow , like in @entity8 's image			2
the left - hand image shows a spawning magnificent sea anemone sat on torch coral this mean - looking fish is the yellowface wrasse			1
when not lit using uv lights , the fish has a grey body , and as its name suggests , a yellow head with pink bands			0
they live in coral areas along the shoreline , as well as in lagoons this staghorn coral is also known as green forest because of its similarity with forests above the ground			2
it is one of several corals of the genus @entity389 which is instantly recognisable for having skeleton branches similar to the antlers of a stag			0

underwater photographer @entity8 took the images on a standard dslr camera in an underwater housing
he used external flash strobes to illuminate the underwater flora and fauna off the coast of @entity17 and @entity18
to create the glowing effect , @entity8 also filmed the marine life using filters and fluorescent lighting
images feature a juvenile fimbriated moray , a dusky nebrotha , torch coral and the orangutan crab
