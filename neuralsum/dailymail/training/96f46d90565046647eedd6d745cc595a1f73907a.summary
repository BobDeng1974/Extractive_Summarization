if you regularly check your @entity2 account , respond to messages and like posts you could be an easy target for cybercriminals			0
in a recent study , researchers subjected students to phishing attacks on @entity2 , using a fake profile			2
they discovered that the majority of regular @entity2 users will accept fake friend requests , but those who use the site habitually are more susceptible to fraud and phishing attacks			1
students at the @entity18 were asked to participate in an online survey about technology use , including how often they used @entity2 , and how concerned they were about security and privacy			1
each student was then sent a fake friend request , followed by a phishing message the research was carried out by dr. @entity28 , author of the @entity30 study			1
he asked 150 students at the @entity18 to participate in an online survey about technology use			1
recent research by @entity35 discovered the number of internet users who faced phishing attacks over the last 12 months has grown from 19.9 million to 37.3 million , an increase of 87 per cent			0
@entity2 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 are among main targets of cybercriminals			0
phishing is a form of internet fraud in which criminals create a fake copy of a popular site - an email service , a banking website , a social networking site , or more - and try to lure the users to these rogue web pages			0
the unsuspecting user enters their login information and passwords into these forged websites as they normally would , but these access credentials are instead sent to the cyberiminals			0
buried among the questions were measures to determine each student ’s @entity2 usage , habitual @entity2 use , total size of their @entity2 social network , and their concern for privacy			2
six weeks later , each student was sent a friend request from a fake @entity2 account , created specifically for the study , and all requests were sent to the 150 students within minutes of each other			1
a further two weeks later , all the subjects who accepted the fake friend were sent a @entity2 message from the fake profile			2
to appear similar to a phishing email attack , this message had a grammatical error and a deadline in the body of the text			0
the phisher stated that someone he knew was looking for interns , and that interested individuals should respond within three days with their student id number , email user name and date of birth			0
the majority of students who used the site regularly accepted the fake friend request			1
but , only the most habitual users fell victim to the phishing attack			1
the phishing messages ( pictured ) stated that someone the user knew was looking for interns , and interested individuals should respond with their personal details			0
the majority of students who used the site regularly accepted the fake friend requests , but , only the most habitual users fell victim to the phishing attack ‘ in social media platforms such as @entity2 , messages sent within the platform show the picture of the sender , ’ said dr @entity28			1
‘ it is conceivable that habitual @entity2 users see the pictures , presume it is from a friend , and automatically respond to such requests without considering how they are connected with the person , how long they have known him , or who else is connected to that individual			2
‘ perhaps being connected to a large number of people makes it difficult to discern a friend from a stranger ; or frequently interacting with the platform makes individuals more likely to overlook the nuances in the message that might reveal deception			0
‘ hence , habitual @entity2 users appear significantly more likely to be inattentive and automatically provide the information requested by a phisher			2

students were asked to participate in an online survey about technology use
this included how often they used @entity2 , and concerns about privacy
each student was sent a fake friend request , followed by a phishing message
majority of @entity2 users were willing to accept the fake friend requests
but only the most habitual users fell victim to the phishing message
