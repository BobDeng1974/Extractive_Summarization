creative : @entity7 said the ideas usually come to her when she sits in front of a mirror and instead of planning them out , she relies on trial and error the eye 's the limit : @entity7 decided to use her lips as a canvas to create living self portraits and the results are incredible her impressive skills have won her worldwide recognition and she now has visitors to her blog from all over the globe			0

creative @entity7 , a care assistant from @entity47 in @entity48 , said the ideas usually come to her when she sits in front of a mirror			1
instead of planning them out , she relies on trial and error			0
she uses a minute eyeliner brush to create fine lines and detail and uses a make - up palette to apply different colours to her skin , a process that can take up to one hour			1
fruity lips : she began creating designs out of products in her make - up bag when she was ' bored ' one night and now has an impressive gallery of work when she has finished , the results are photographed and posted on her make - up blog			2
@entity7 said : ' i began to make advanced make - up designs about three years ago			1
' it was mostly when i was bored and had nothing else to do			0
' but now i use almost any free time i get to do make - up , my interest in it has increased , and because i have found how much fun it is to challenge myself with it			2
intricate detail : she uses a minute eyeliner brush to create fine lines and detail and uses a make - up palette to apply different colours to her skin lengthy process : one design can take up to an hour to create - but her designs have won her much praise online ' i am self - taught and i have tried my own way of doing things , and i have also learned from different video and picture tutorials on @entity97			1
' not all tests have gone well , but then i tend to think that you learn more from an unsuccessful try than successful one , then it at least feels a little better afterwards			0
' the ideas i usually get when i sit in front of the mirror , i try to think of strange things to do that do n't really belong on a pair of lips			0
' i am inspired by nature , animals , pictures and stuff like that			0
natural talent : @entity7 is self - taught and she learned from different video and picture tutorials on @entity97 ' most times i just do something , and let my fantasy take me were it wants to go , then the make - up gets crazy and psycho			1
' what inspires me most is to do different and new things			0
for example doing the same make - up twice feels boring and unchallenging , so i 'd rather not do it			2
' i get really sweet and positive reactions to my make - up which makes me so happy , i often hear that i inspire others and that 's really fun to hear , it 's something i love doing			2
