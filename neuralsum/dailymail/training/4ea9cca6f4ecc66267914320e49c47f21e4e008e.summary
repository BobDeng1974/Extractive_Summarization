the brother of @entity1 said on thursday that the @entity3 administration threatened him when he tried to raise funds for the slain journalist 's release from the terrorist group that beheaded him			1
' they were actually an impedance , ' @entity1 told @entity10 , referring to the government 's role in rescuing his older brother , a photojournalist who was kidnapped by @entity15 militants in @entity16 in 2012			1
' they got in our way ... that 's what really bothers me to the core			1
' the @entity24 follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for @entity24 kidnapped by them , arguing doing so only leads to more abductions			1
@entity32 has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the @entity3 administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release captured and executed : @entity1 was taken hostage on @entity46 , 2012 , while working for @entity47 in northern @entity16 and executed - video of the brutal act was released online on august 19 ' we have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other @entity24 in a position where they 're at even greater risk , ' @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said			1
@entity1 , however , said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brother 's freedom			1
' i was specifically threatened by the @entity70 about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother , ' he said			1
' we were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down			0
we lost a lot of time			0
' @entity24 freelance reporter @entity1 was kidnapped in war - torn @entity16 in november , 2012 and executed by his @entity15 captors in a video posted online on august 19 of this year @entity80 , at right , and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure @entity1 ' release from the hands of his captors in a separate interview with @entity89 , his mother , @entity31 , said a military officer working for the @entity91 told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom			1
' we took it as a threat and it was appalling , ' she said			0
' three times he intimidated us with that message			0
we were horrified he would say that			0
he just told us we would be prosecuted			0
we knew we had to save our son , we had to try , ' a spokeswoman for the @entity91 said that the @entity1 family was informed of @entity24 laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment , according to @entity89			1
@entity80 also said in the interview the new military campaign the @entity24 is pursuing to stop @entity15 ' came too late for @entity114			1
' devastated : @entity31 and @entity115 talk to reporters , on wednesday august 20 , 2014 outside their home in @entity37 , @entity38			0
the day before shocking footage of their son 's execution was posted online strategy : president @entity3 addresses the nation from the @entity124 in the @entity51 in @entity125 on wednesday and said he had authorized @entity24 airstrikes inside @entity16 for the first time , along with expanded strikes in @entity129 , as part of ' a steady , relentless effort ' to root out @entity133 extremists ' i just hope it 's not too late for others , ' he said			2
@entity15 is still holding several hostages from @entity139 and other countries			0
@entity31 earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the @entity3 administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group , saying , ' i really feel our country let @entity114 down			2
' on the 13th anniversary of 9/11 and the day after president @entity3 addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat @entity15 , @entity1 told @entity153 that ' as an @entity24 ' , she was ' embarrassed and appalled ' at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity			2
articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview , she made the startling claim that @entity24 officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for @entity1 , 40 , and said ' @entity114 was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization			1
' and in a thinly veiled attack on @entity3 's new strategy to ' degrade and destroy ' @entity15 she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said , ' bombing caused @entity114 's death			2
' ' @entity114 was killed in the most horrific way			0
he was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination , lack of communication , lack of prioritization , ' @entity1 said			2
' as a family , we had to find our way through this on our own			0
' still grieving , @entity31 also said @entity24 officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son			0
at times withering in her assessment of the @entity3 administration 's co-ordination with her family , mrs. @entity31 poured scorn on the @entity192 's claim they tried to rescue @entity1 on july 4 , only to raid the wrong base			1
speaking to @entity153 's @entity194 , @entity1 said her family knew where @entity1 was being held on two separate occasions in @entity16 , and that each time he was there for months following his capture on @entity46 , 2012			1
on august 19 , @entity15 released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of @entity1 by a masked @entity15 militant , who told the camera in a @entity203 accent , that his ' real killer ' was the @entity24			2
exactly two weeks later , another @entity24 journalist , @entity205 , was beheaded , apparently by the same man , who tells the camera , ' i 'm back @entity3 '			0
during the efforts to get @entity1 home , mrs. @entity31 said she met good people , people who wanted to help , but was adamant that she did n't want to single anyone out and lay ' blame '			2
mrs. @entity31 said it was important to remember that @entity15 is the enemy and not the @entity24			0
however , ultimately , she ' did n't feel that @entity114 was a priority			0
' ' we were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow , miraculously , ' said @entity1 's mother to @entity153			1
' and he was n't , was he ? ' watch the latest video at &amp; lt ; a href = ' http://video.foxnews.com'&amp;gt;video.foxnews.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt ; watch the full interview over at @entity153			0
