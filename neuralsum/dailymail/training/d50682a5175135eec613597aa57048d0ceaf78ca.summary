authorities swooped in on the 49 - year - old kingpin as he left a house in @entity19 , the capital of @entity14 , along with eight bodyguards and associates toting a grenade launcher , three grenades , an uzi machine pistol and assault rifles , national security commissioner @entity15 said			1
they were taken without a shot fired after a months - long intelligence stakeout , in which @entity8 's associates were identified when they gathered for his birthday february 6 with cakes , soft drinks and food			1
he was then dragged to a helicopter in front of waiting press family associate : @entity46 , brother of @entity47 , aka ' @entity48 ' , is also dragged away from another helicopter at an airport in @entity39 @entity15 said the key break came months ago when agents identified one of @entity8 's most - trusted messengers , a group of people who apparently supplied him with food , clothing and medicine when he earlier hid out in the remote mountains of his home state			1
@entity8 's quasi-religious criminal band once exercised what interior secretary @entity63 called ' absolute control ' over @entity14			1
it orchestrated politics , controlled commerce , dictated rules and preached a code of ethics around devotion to @entity73 and family , even as it murdered and plundered			0
but the cartel lost power when the federal government took over the state to try to restore order in january 2014 after vigilantes began fighting the gang			2
other @entity2 leaders were captured or killed over the past year as authorities kept up the hunt for @entity8 , who had a $ 2 million bounty on his head			1
@entity88 's government , which took office a little over two years ago , has been aggressive in capturing drug lords , including the biggest capo , @entity93 ' @entity92 of the powerful @entity94 , a year ago			1
@entity95 down : @entity46 was sat inside the helicopter			0
his brother had is believed to have had a $ 2million bounty on his head transfer : masked federal police stand next to an armored vehicle carrying the drug kingpin on friday in all , 10 top leaders of various cartels have been captured or killed in the last six years , six of them under @entity88			1
of @entity4 's top criminal leaders , only @entity105 of the @entity94 remains at large			2
' we are advancing , we are responding , we are having major apprehensions of the most wanted , most dangerous criminals , ' @entity88 said friday , congratulating and thanking the federal forces that helped apprehend @entity8			1
' overall , we continue to work toward a @entity4 of peace that we all want			0
' crime will only shift around as the now weakened cartel regroups , or even splinters , as has happened with some of @entity4 's drug gangs after the killings or capture of top leaders			1
others continue business as usual after top leadership hits			2
' dismantling them was a necessary step , but that does not end the problem of insecurity , ' @entity122 , a @entity39 - based security analyst , said of the @entity2			2
' the next part is more complicated			0
there are still small groups , remnants , which will be extorting , robbing and perhaps even producing methamphetamine			0
' response : despite a huge armed presence , @entity8 and eight associates were taken without a shot fired following a month - long intelligence stakeout but the arrests , even those hitting the powerful and international @entity94 , seem to have had little effect on the flow of drugs			1
seizures at the @entity145 - @entity4 border have fluctuated since 2010 , when 2.7 million pounds were seized , to a high of 3.1 million in 2011 and down to 2.3 million pounds in 2014 , according to @entity145 government figures , the only way to estimate flows of drugs			2
' it 's a dangerous proposition to suggest @entity2 is dismantled , ' said @entity152 , associate political science professor at the @entity154			0
' it may take six months or a year , but this is a group of illegal actors that has staying power			2
their roots go back to ` 80s and ` 90s			0
they just had different stages			0
the names change and the leaders change , but the problems in many ways persist			0
' indeed , the @entity2 grew out of the @entity171 cartel , where @entity8 started out transporting marijuana before becoming a top leader about a decade ago			1
the cartel initially portrayed itself as a crusader gang , protecting communities from the @entity178 cartel			0
witnesses said @entity171 trained its recruits in ultra-violent techniques like beheading and dismembering victims , and it frequently ambushed soldiers and federal police			0
escort : federal police officers stand on the back of pick - up trucks leaving the assistant attorney general 's office for @entity190 ( @entity191 ) in @entity39 following @entity8 ' capture the government hit @entity171 hard , starting in the administration of president @entity195 in late 2006			1
officials declared the cartel beaten in 2010 after allegedly killing its leader , @entity198			0
but @entity171 fled to the neighboring states of @entity200 and @entity4 , where it now fights other regional gangs for control of the lucrative and growing heroin trade			0
@entity198 , who actually had n't died , then started @entity2 with @entity8 and took an even stronger hold on @entity14			1
after @entity198 was finally killed last year and @entity8 going on the run , the @entity2 too is now operating in @entity200 , at least in the city of @entity207 , extorting protection payments from small business owners			1

they were threatened with violence , kidnapping or the burning of their stores if they did n't pay			0
' i have the impression that this is another detention of no judicial consequence , ' @entity226 , a cartel expert and senior scholar at @entity228 , said of @entity8 's arrest			2
' it 's only meant to reorder the map to reach a @entity236 kind of peace outside the justice system to improve the image of the administration of @entity88			0
' in @entity19 , newspaper vehicles rolled through the streets with loudspeakers announcing a special edition about @entity8 's arrest			2
' it 's very good news that they have detained @entity48 , but i do n't know if it will solve @entity14 's problems , ' said @entity250 , a taxi driver			2
' there will still be crime			0
