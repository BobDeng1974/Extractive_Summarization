by @entity0 a viking metal rod which left experts baffled for more than a century has finally been identified as a ' magic wand ' used by a witch to cast spells			1
the staff , which was found in a ninth - century grave , is curved at the end - causing it to be misidentified as a fishing hook or a spit for roasting food			1
however , archaeologists have now concluded that it was in fact a magical item belonging to a sorceress who was ' on the margins of society '			2
@entity19 : this curved rod is believed to have been a staff belonging to a @entity23 sorceress in the 9th century they suggest that the reason it was bent before being buried with its owner was to remove its magical properties - possibly to prevent the witch coming back from the dead			1
the 90cm - long rod has been part of the @entity34 's collection since 1894 , when it was discovered in @entity38 's @entity37 province			1
it had been buried next to a woman 's body alongside other valuable items including an unusual plaque made of whalebone , implying that the person in the grave had a high status in @entity23 society			2
its unusual shape , with a knobbly ' handle ' and a hooked end , originally led historians to believe that it was a practical object used for catching fish			2
outcast : a reconstruction of how @entity23 witches could have looked as they wielded their fearsome staffs power : runes , seen carved on a standing stone , are thought to have had magical associations magical rituals are thought to have been central to many early medieval societies , but in most regions the advent of @entity66 displaced them and obliterated all trace			2
however , @entity69 was not converted to @entity66 until the late 10th and early 11th centuries , meaning that we have much more historical and architectural evidence about their pagan beliefs			0
the magic apparently carried out by the owner of the @entity34 staff is known as ' seithr ' , and was usually carried out by women sorceresses			1
it was used for both peaceful and aggressive purposes - some practitioners claimed to use their skills to predict the future , but others cast spells to curse their enemies			0
the runic alphabet , used to write @entity89 languages before the coming of @entity66 , is also thought to have had magical associations			2
roman author @entity91 described how germanic priests would write symbols on pieces of bark before casting them as lots to tell the future , while the great god @entity98 was said to have had special skills in rune - reading and divination			0
after @entity66 came to the @entity104 world , traditional magic began to die out - but only after the old and new faiths went through a period of conflict			0
the 10th - century @entity108 of @entity38 was brought up a @entity109 , but after ascending to the throne he found himself pressured to take part in pagan rituals which involved eating horse liver at a pubic feast			1
they later decided that it was in fact a skewer for roasting meat - but after comparing the rod with other similar objects , experts have now reached a different conclusion			1
@entity34 curator @entity123 says that it was probably a magical staff used to perform ' seithr ' , a form of @entity23 sorcery predominantly practiced by women			1
' our rod fits with a number of these rods that turn up in the ninth and 10th century in female burials , ' she told @entity135			2
' they normally take the form of these long iron rods with knobs attached to them			0
' the curve in the end of the staff is likely to have signified that it was being put out of use , a common practice in the medieval period for grave goods which were routinely broken when they were buried			1
bending or breaking the buried possessions of the dead could have served to neutralise their magical properties - preventing their former owners from casting spells from beyond the grave			1
' there must have been some kind of ritual , ' ms @entity123 said			0
' this object was ritually " killed " , an act that would have removed the power of this object			0
' although @entity23 society , like most medieval societies , was dominated by men , some women were believed to have special powers which made them influential figures			0
ms @entity123 said : ' these women were very well respected , but they were quite feared as well			0
they may have been on the margins of society			0
' because the @entity173 were not converted to @entity66 until around 1000 ad , there is strong evidence for the importance of magic in their society at a time when the rest of @entity181 had largely abandoned the practice			0
fierce : but women could be prominent figures in @entity23 society despite the common image of it as being dominated by warriors ; medieval enthusiasts are pictured celebrating @entity189 in @entity190 this week display : the staff will be placed in a new gallery in the @entity34 alongside other early medieval treasures such as this belt buckle from @entity196 @entity198 , the pre-christian writing system used in @entity69 and elsewhere , have long been thought to have had magical associations and were apparently used to tell the future			1
the witch 's staff will go on display in the @entity34 's new early medieval gallery , which is set to open on march 27			1
the room will also contain highlights of the museum 's collections including the @entity210 treasures found at @entity196 .			0
