an extra £ 100million will be made available for homeowners to get cheap new boilers and double glazing , the @entity0 announced today			1
the extra money will allow more families to apply for grants of around £ 8,000 to improve their home ’s energy efficiency			1
those who have moved home in the past year , meanwhile , are likely to get up to £ 500 under the ‘ @entity10 ’ - although the exact details are yet to be agreed			1
the big six energy firms have also been ordered to slash the time it takes for people to switch to cheaper rivals , energy secretary @entity12 said today			1
he also confirmed plans for families to get £ 100 off their council tax bill if they make their property more energy efficient and told delegates that the @entity0 would seek to bring in laws to ban coal being used to generate electricity from 2025 should they be in government after next year 's general election			1
but mr @entity12 's set piece announcement was the £ 100million boost to the @entity10			1
he said : ‘ today i can announce an extra one hundred million pounds to help people cut their energy bills			1
‘ we will extend the @entity10 that proved so popular earlier this year			1
so people can permanently cut their bills			0
’ replacing an inefficient boiler and insulating cavity walls costs about £ 4,000 , with an average energy bill saving of £ 200 to £ 300 a year			1
solid wall insulation costs between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000 , but can save households up to £ 400 a year on heating bills			1
insulating a loft and installing solar panels costs £ 6,000 and saves about £ 200 a year			1
mr @entity12 claimed the energy market was in a ‘ real mess ’ under @entity54			1
he said : ‘ @entity55 , @entity54 ’s last energy minister , left an energy market dominated by the “ @entity58 ” , with over 99 per cent market share			1
‘ @entity55 had refused to take on these big business interests			0
@entity55 was happy with @entity54 ’s @entity61			2
‘ well , @entity0 were n’t			0
we could see the dangers to people ’s energy bills from @entity54 ’s weak approach to energy competition			1
after all , fuel poverty had rocketed under @entity54			0
‘ so we set out to grow new competitors to @entity54 ’s @entity70			2
to make it easier and quicker for people to switch their energy supplier			1
‘ and it ’s worked			2
we ’ve nearly trebled the number of smaller firms			2
two million people have switched from @entity54 ’s big 6			2
‘ and prices are now being frozen – or better , in many cases , cut			0
and despite that success , i want to go much further			0
‘ that ’s why i support the first ever independent review of @entity85 ’s energy markets – a review @entity55 rejected three times when he was doing my job			1
‘ that ’s why i can announce today that i am delivering on my promise to halve switching times this year			2
every major energy firm is on schedule to deliver the faster switching i have demanded			2
’ the @entity0 want more onshore wind farm turbines - like this one next to the coal fired @entity97 at @entity98 , @entity99 mr @entity12 attacked the @entity100 for wanting to ‘ frack every square mile of @entity85 ’ – but warned activists that the ‘ real enemy ’ was not shale gas but coal			0
he said : ‘ @entity107 is the climate destroyer			0
that ’s why i ’m pleased to announce that if the @entity0 are in government after the election , we will legislate to ban the generation of electricity from coal from 2025			2
‘ but renewables can not quickly replace all of the electricity we currently get from coal without carbon , capture and storage			0
we will need gas , as a bridge to a zero fossil fuel future , at least for the next two or three decades			0
‘ and i ’d far rather use @entity85 ’s gas , than @entity130 ’s gas			2
‘ our own gas is much more secure			0
and , thanks to our tougher environmental regulations , and not having to ship it round the world , our own gas is better for the climate			0
‘ as @entity141 gas production falls , we simply can not afford to turn our back on our own , home grown gas supplies			0
‘ but i have had to hold back the @entity100 ’ desire to frack every square mile of @entity85			0
ensuring that gas exploration is safe			0
protecting our national parks , areas of outstanding beauty and world heritage sites			0
stopping a @entity153 free - for - all on fracking			0

families can apply for around £ 8,000 to improve home ’s energy efficiency
cash will top up the popular ' @entity10 '
energy firms also ordered to slash time it takes to switch to cheaper rival
