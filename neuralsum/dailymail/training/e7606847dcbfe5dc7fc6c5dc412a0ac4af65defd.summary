a man who got so fat he could n't fit on the @entity1 has shed an incredible 16st in just 10 months			2
at the beginning of 2014 @entity4 , 33 , weighed 28st and was so worried his enormous frame would get him stuck in a rush hour crush he 'd get up to travel to work three hours early - to make sure he could fit on the @entity1			1
having conquered bulimia in his twenties , the pharmaceutical worker would starve himself of treats before gorging on them - and watched his weight balloon to dangerous levels			1
newly trim @entity4 , who now lives in @entity23 , said : ' at my heaviest i 'd go to work at 6am instead of 9am so nobody saw me on the tube			1
' i was so self - conscious of people staring at me out of breath or sweating - or worse , me not being able to fit in the carriages			2
' when i moved to @entity1 in 2012 , i broke up from a long - term relationship and piled on ten stone in a year			0
' i 'd hole myself up in my room and gorge on about 10,000 calories a day			0
' i was in a vicious cycle where i would n't go out because i was ashamed of my size so i 'd spend my time eating			2
' @entity4 had had an unhealthy relationship with food since he was 15 , when a throwaway insult left him devastated			1
@entity4 , pictured left half way through his amazing weight loss , lost 5st 10lb on his regime of healthy eating and daily walks , before deciding to pay privately for a sleeve gastrectomy to lose the remaining weight he became very aware of his figure and as soon as he ate something , would rush upstairs to vomit			1
despite overcoming bulimia in his twenties , he would starve himself for days at a time , convinced that would maintain a healthy weight			1
eventually , he would cave and eat one small thing before the floodgates opened and he would devour anything he could			0
@entity4 said : ' there was no set pattern to my eating routine			1
' takeaways were the norm for me , because they did n't need cooking so there was no time to talk myself out of them			0
' i would swallow the food as quickly as possible in a desperate attempt to finish it all before i was full			0
@entity4 suffered with bulimia in his adolescence but has managed to finally overcome them and is now happy with his body ' to compensate , the next day i would skip meals but then the pattern would start again			1
' i would see people eat whatever they wanted , but pretend i was full			0
' then , when i got home , i would eat five times as much if i had eaten earlier on			0
' at his heaviest , @entity4 tipped the scales at 30st , but when he moved home he decided to seek counselling			1
@entity4 says : ' my surgeon was exceptional and played a massive part in changing my life			1
one evening he tried to walk around his block , but after getting halfway he considered calling a taxi			2
he powered through , and feeling ridiculously proud managed to walk two streets the following day			2
on his new regime of healthy eating and daily walks , he lost 5st 10lb by march and explored the possibility of surgery			1
he plumped for the stomach reduction surgery , rather than the cheaper gastric band , paying £ 9,000 to have it done privately the operation , a sleeve gastrectomy , reduces the size of the stomach by 75 per cent and removes the part that produces the hormone that makes you hungry			1
@entity4 explains : ' i rejected the idea of having it on the @entity107 as i did n't want people judging me as another fat person getting a free operation			2
' i was in the right frame of mind to have the surgery and went for it			2
' because of the exercise i was reasonably toned and was n't left with a huge excess of skin			0
' the surgeon , mr @entity118 , was exceptional and they played a massive part in changing my life			0
' i 've lost a further 10st and i 'm no longer buying my clothes from plus - size stores			0
' i can get both of my legs into just one of old trouser legs ! ' @entity118 , @entity128 at the @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity131 , said : ' @entity4 is a model patient , one who has been more motivated than most to lose weight			1
' it is a very successful procedure and while it is expensive at about £ 9,000 , in the long term it can save you money			0
' one of our patients put what she used to spend on food in a glass jar and found that over four years she had saved £ 20,000			0
' weight loss surgery is not a vanity issue or a cosmetic issue , it is a health issue			1
' it reduces your risk of @entity151 diabetes by 90 per cent and of high blood pressure by 70 per cent and that has a huge impact on your need for healthcare and on your quality of life			0
