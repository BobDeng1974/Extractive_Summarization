@entity2 's scheming under - butler @entity0 is n’t anyone ’s idea of a hero			1
but in the new series of the hit @entity10 drama , the manservant played by @entity7 risks his life to rescue a sleeping @entity13 from a blaze that engulfs her bedroom			1
our exclusive pictures from the opening episode of the fifth series show the dramatic moment @entity21 lifts the @entity23 ’s daughter into his arms and leads her to safety down a smoke - filled corridor			1
the dramatic storyline – which has been glimpsed in trailers for the series – leads to the full - scale evacuation of @entity2			1
however , to avoid spoiling the series for viewers , we will not reveal the fate of any other characters			1
producers could not risk smoke damage to the corridor at @entity48 , where the series is filmed , so they built a replica at @entity51			2
the fictional fire has echoes in the history of @entity55 , according to @entity56 , chatelaine of the @entity59 stately home			2
writing on her blog about what she calls ‘ the great fire of @entity2 ’ , the @entity60 details the two blazes that hit @entity55 in the past			2
the first ravaged the @entity67 150 years ago , and she said viewers could spot the consequences of that blaze			2
she wrote : ‘ if you look closely at the gilded ceiling when you are watching the tv series you will see that it is far less ornate than the main library			0
’ the second fire broke out in rooms above the library in the 1930s			0
on that occasion three bedrooms were gutted but no one was hurt			0
escape : the pair flee through a corridor - but the scene was filmed in a studio , not the @entity48 flames of passion are also raging through @entity2 in the new series			1
lady @entity92 ’s love life is centre stage now that she has finally come to terms with the death of her husband @entity96 , while the fallout from @entity99 ’s rape and @entity13 ’s secret love child continues to cast a long shadow			1
the new series is set against the election of @entity105 ’s first @entity104 government in 1924			1
the result proves unpopular with butler @entity107 , played by @entity108 , and the @entity23 , played by @entity109 , who is convinced the new government is committed to the destruction of what he calls ‘ @entity113 ’			0
when his daughter @entity92 asks if he is prejudiced because new prime minister @entity114 is the son of a crofter , the @entity23 replies : ‘ i do n’t care if he is the son of @entity117			0
’ the first episode , which airs at 9pm on sunday , september 21 , is set as the @entity119 celebrate their 34th wedding anniversary			1
they may not actually live at @entity2 but these three women will make their presence felt in series five			0
outspoken school teacher @entity125 ( @entity126 , above left ) secretly helps assistant cook @entity126 to brush up on her maths and @entity129			0
but @entity125 ’s left - wing views cause conflict as the @entity23 calls her the ‘ @entity132 of the @entity133 ’			0
meanwhile , the @entity60 ’s imperious friend @entity134 ( @entity135 , centre ) is embroiled in a love triangle with @entity138 and lord @entity139			0
but there ’s far greater scandal as the amorous @entity142 – played by @entity143 , right – is an unwelcome house guest .			0
