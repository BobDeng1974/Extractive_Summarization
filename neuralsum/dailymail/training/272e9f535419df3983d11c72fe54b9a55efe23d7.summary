pose : four members of the drugs gang , which made tens of thousands of pounds from selling cocaine and heroin , pose for a photograph entitled ' @entity8 ' ( after the gangster film by @entity19 ) but their efforts to copy the movie mob ended when they were infiltrated by undercover police … and they were jailed for a total of 62 years			1
