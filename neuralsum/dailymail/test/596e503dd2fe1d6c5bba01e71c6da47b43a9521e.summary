no matter how young or old we are , most of us experience the odd memory lapse			2
perhaps it will be forgetting where you put the car keys , or what you went to get from upstairs			1
thankfully , these moments pass			0
but for those with dementia there is no such relief			2
imagine what it 's like being unable to recall what you 'd done an hour before			1
or not remembering how to navigate around your own house or the names of your nearest and dearest			2
or knowing what everyday things are for , such as a fridge			2
today , in the third part of our major @entity28 series on dementia , we look at ways to help minimise the impact of these memory problems , to prolong independence and help those with dementia live as full a life as possible			1
recently , scientists have found out why			0
during deep sleep , brain waves move memories from the hippocampus - the area of the brain that is involved in short - term memory - to the prefrontal cortex at the front of the brain , where long - term memories are stored			1
if this does n't happen , short - term memories get overwritten with new ones and the consequence is forgetfulness , according to researchers at the @entity66			1
it is a common misconception that we need less sleep as we get older - in fact we need just as much , the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep			1
getting a good night 's sleep can be especially difficult for those with dementia , especially those with @entity78 's disease who may experience changes to their sleeping patterns			1
quite why this happens is not understood , but it may be related to the impact the condition has on the brain			2
but there are steps that can make it easier			2
one of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day ( this becomes harder to avoid as dementia becomes more advanced )			1
@entity93 makes it both harder to fall asleep at night and more likely you 'll wake up earlier than desired			0
other steps include avoiding caffeine - coffee or tea - in the evening			2
a regular bedtime is also important as this gives the body the cues it needs to feel sleepy at set times , making it easier to fall asleep			1
although many people believe a nightcap will help them sleep , alcohol is counter-productive and tends to make you wake in the night			1
it is a diuretic and , therefore , you are likely to wake up needing to go to the loo			0
it is also known to reduce the amount of the night you spend in deep , restorative sleep			0
regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus eating too much junk food : cakes , chips and biscuits wo n't just impact on the waistline - they can adversely affect your memory , too			1
recent research has found that regularly eating food high in fat and sugar leads to inflammation in the hippocampus			0
scientists at the @entity127 , @entity128 , found that eating these foods every day caused inflammation in the brain after just one week			1
the work was done on rats , but it is thought the principle could extend to humans			0
smoking : many studies have found that even occasional smoking can impact on the brain			2
one study , from @entity140 , analysed 8,000 over- 50s and found that smokers performed worst in memory tests , learning ability and reasoning			2
why this happens is thought to be linked to the fact that smoking reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain			0
those who have smoked have also been shown to have greater overall shrinkage of the brain			0
not ' using it ' : when someone is diagnosed with dementia , they often start to withdraw from their normal hobbies and activities			0
yet to retain your mental ability and memory skills for as long as possible you need to keep the brain stimulated			2
think of it this way : just as our bodies need physical exercise in order to stay as strong as possible so , too , do our brains			0
it 's a tried - and - tested principle : for example , a review of 15 studies by the respected @entity174 looked at the benefits of a variety of activities designed to stimulate the brain and promote memory such as word games , puzzles , listening to music and practical activities such as baking and indoor gardening			1
the studies involved 718 participants with dementia - some took part in these activities and others did not			1
after between one and three months those who 'd taken part in the brain stimulating and practical activities did better on cognitive function tests than those who did not			1
@entity198 to help with a failing memory a failing short - term memory is a characteristic of dementia and can make it difficult to cope with day - to - day life			1
the following strategies may help : one of the most important measures is to avoid catnapping during the day have set meal times , as these are easier to remember - and write them down on a whiteboard to help recall what time is meal time			1
the @entity214 type of diet may be most beneficial as it 's been shown to maintain the health of the blood vessels , and keeping a healthy circulation is key for people with dementia as it ensures a healthy flow of blood to the brain			1
try to include oily fish such as trout , salmon or mackerel three times a week : the latest research suggests this is a good way to stop brain shrinkage			1
these fish contain omega - 3 fatty acids and research has found that people with the highest level of these have less shrinkage in the hippocampus , the area associated with memory			1
to confirm a diagnosis of dementia or to access specialist services , a gp can refer a patient to a memory clinic			1
normally , these are based either at a community clinic or at a hospital			0
they will have a team of psychologist nurses and doctors			0
as well as running tests that can help provide a diagnosis , they co-ordinate a range of services to help the dementia patient			0
for example , all clinics will offer cognitive stimulation therapy			0
this takes the form of group activities and exercises the patient is invited to attend twice a week for seven weeks			0
these activities could involve word games or even singing and have been found to help improve language skills and comprehension			0
each session lasts for about 45 minutes			0
you can not simply attend a clinic - you need to be referred			0
typically , there is a four - to - six week wait after referral for an appointment			2
if the patient is too infirm or incapacitated to attend , most clinics can offer a home assessment by one of the community mental health team			0
do it in chronological order			0
having a history of their life can help them remember and , as the condition progresses this book may also be useful to bring out to show them if they seem distressed			1
asking the person with dementia to reminisce and recall stories about the people or events shown in the pictures can also be a good way to ' use it '			1

this is the third part of our major @entity28 series on dementia
we look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems
for example , we need just as much sleep as we get older
the problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep
when the short - term memory starts to go , it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day , such as whether they **'ve** had *breakfast* , or showered , or *spoken* to someone .
it can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day . writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes , which can help slow down *future* decline .
create a memory *hub* - that is , a central place in the home , perhaps the dining room table or a desk , where important notes , car keys , house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept . put things here that you want to be able to find *quickly* . get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things *scattered* about the home .
get a whiteboard or *blackboard* - that can be used to record a *timetable* of what needs to be done each day that week . things that get done can be ticked off . it is another way to show what has been done , but also shows what remains to be done .
label doors , drawers , *cupboards* and *cabinets* to avoid *confusion* about what goes where .
have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your gp and other care professionals , carers , family and *reliable* friends .
have a daily *newspaper* delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day 's date .
when showering or having a bath , establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed . for example , move the conditioner and *shampoo* from one side of the bath to the other once you **'ve** used them .
eat regular meals . while other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere , the brain relies on a good supply of *glucose* from the blood . that 's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning , cognition and memory .
in the early stages of dementia , begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person 's life and who people are . it 's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together . include pictures and *snippets* of *information* and date and label every entry .
