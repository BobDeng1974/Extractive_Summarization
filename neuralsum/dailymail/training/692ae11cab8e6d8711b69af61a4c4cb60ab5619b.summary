three couples , who are determined to build the restaurant of their dreams , have turned to crowd sourcing to fund their $ 100,000 project			1
the entrepreneurs , who also co-own another bar in @entity8 , have so far raised over $ 80,000 for the creation of @entity11 's @entity10 which , if successful , will be the first permanent crowd - funded restaurant in @entity14			1
one of the creative minds behind the community project , @entity17 , told @entity18 that donors were not contributing to a charity , but would have their money returned to them in another form			2
they are given an opportunity to redeem that value at the restaurant when it opens , ' mr @entity17 said			0
' that 's really important as to why we 've been so successfully			0
' the 32 - year - old said that donation options start from as little as $ 5 , with which donors will have their name painted on the ' @entity44 of @entity11 '			2
' the top tier pledge level is $ 20,000 and we have actually had two different people take that on , ' he said			0
' one of them is a lovely couple who are getting married next year and wanted something different for their wedding reception , location and theme			0
we 'll be closing down the venue just for them , as we wo n't take bookings like this in the future			0
with only 15 days to go , the team of entrepreneurs have raised more than $ 80,000 of their $ 100,000 limit one of the future owners of the restaurant , @entity17 ( right ) , said the crowd - sourcing project was not just about sourcing money , but also about hearing design and food ideas from the future customers ' we are also taking the chance to sit down with them and work through wedding cocktails and food for the one off because we 've been blown away by their support			1
' one of the most popular pledges is the @entity79 , designed for a couple to donate $ 55 towards the building of the restaurant and in return receive a romantic dinner and drinks for two to the value of $ 85			2
but it 's not just about sourcing money , mr @entity17 explains			2
even if the owners do n't reach their $ 100,000 target in the next 15 days – which would mean they do n't receive a cent of the pledged donations , @entity11 's will still come to life			1
the future owners of the bar have been using their donations ' page and social media to ask people what they want the future bar and restaurant to serve and even look like and also to create excitement about the coming venue			1
the future site of @entity11 's : the restaurant and bar will be designed to resemble a @entity110 laundry that has been haphazardly converted into a speak - easy ' on the hard dollar side of things , one hundred thousand is n't going to be the complete funding budget for project , ' mr @entity17 said			1
' the reality is that if the @entity117 campaign did n't go ahead , @entity11 's will still be a reality – perhaps a smaller less compelling vision than what we had planned , but with @entity117 it will be enriched by not only financial support but their thoughts and opinions and the feedback about what they want to see when it opens			1
' the feedback we 've been getting most is about our opening hours			0
a lot of restaurants and bars close at midnight and from day one of our campaign people were telling us they wanted a late night option for a good quality meal and drink - and not just the hard core hospitality nerds but mums and dads and professionals			0
' we 've also had great feedback about the décor			0
we 're planning to have a large open air courtyard at the top – so there have been suggestions on how to animate that space at night , like @entity110 lanterns or kind of silent movie screen			2
so all these ideas that we have n't thought of is exactly why we caught these nets out and want to hear from our future customers			0
' the highest contributors include a couple who have donated $ 20,000 for @entity11 's to be built , and in return will have their wedding reception at the venue ' people end up feeling like they own a bit of their own bar , which is exactly what we wanted			1
' if all goes to plan , @entity166 's will open in early january of 2015 as a quirky restaurant and bar that resembles an old @entity110 laundry that has been haphazardly reorganised into a speak - easy			1
' the idea was to create a late night venue in @entity173 which paid homage to the history and culture of the @entity178 migration in the area , ' mr @entity17 said			0
' one of the industries that many brought with them was the concept of the @entity110 laundry and in some small areas during the 1900s , there were something like between 50 and 70 of them			1
' we are not pretending that we are doing an authentic @entity178 restaurant by any means , we just want to pay respect and homage to deep flavours and tastes that went before us			0

@entity11 's @entity10 will be the first permanent crowd - funded restaurant in @entity14 if the future owners reach their target
