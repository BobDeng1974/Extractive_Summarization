police have not opened a kidnapping investigation into @entity3 's case despite his claims , while authorities also have a surveillance video of a man on a $ 10,000 spending spree with @entity3 's stolen credit card in @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity12 reported on thursday that @entity15 investigative reporter @entity14 said police have not opened a kidnapping investigation , only a robbery case and an unauthorised use of credit card case			1
however , he said that police believed there was not even sufficient evidence to pursue the robbery case			2
‘ the investigation is still ongoing but we have opened a robbery and fraudulent theft and credit card investigation			1
that is all , ’ @entity23 of the @entity24 told @entity25			0
mr @entity14 claimed that the same man was also caught on surveillance camera going around stores using @entity3 's credit cards to buy more than $ 10,000 worth of merchandise			1
that 's why they 're pursuing that credit card case , ' mr @entity14 said			1
he also said authorities did not believe @entity3 's wounds were consistent with an assault , and that it looked like a scrape suffered from a fall			1
mr @entity14 made it clear that kidnapping is very rare in @entity11 as it has a very low violent crime rate , and that kidnapping usually involves people who know each other			0
' it 's usually a husband and wife , a girlfriend and boyfriend , or a drug dealer and someone who owes him money , ' he explained to 9 news			0
' it almost never happens in the case of someone who is just trying to steal some money , credit cards or an iphone from a tourist			0
that would be a lot of effort to go through			0
' mr @entity14 reiterated that there was still no evidence that mr @entity3 was lying , but that ' there 's a healthy scepticism about parts of his story '			2
since the @entity92 golfer claimed he was knocked unconscious , placed in a boot and dumped 10km from his hotel after missing the cut at the @entity96 on saturday , holes have appeared in his story			2
in yet another twist to the mystery , a homeless man has also come forward claiming he knows where @entity3 was for the two and a half hours that the golfer says he ca n't recall following his alleged abduction			1
@entity103 says he stumbled across the pro golfer passed out on a sidewalk in @entity10 , in @entity11 , at 11pm on saturday and when he and his friend tried to help @entity3 he accused them of stealing his wallet and phone			1
about two hours later , mr @entity103 says he returned to find the golfer still unconscious on the pavement but now with a bloodied face – the man claims the @entity92 was injured from falling over and hitting his head on a rock			1
' then he ’s accusing me and my friend ' you guys stole my wallet and phone – alright the gig is up just hand it over ' so i was like ' brother we are the ones who woke you up - we are the ones just helping you , ' mr @entity103 told @entity127			2
' he was saying ' you do n’t know who i am '			0
' although mr @entity103 denies stealing @entity3 's possessions - someone has been having a fine time with the golfer 's credit card			1
@entity136 detectives are following the spending spree on @entity3 's stolen credit card , as they try to solve the mystery surrounding his alleged abduction last week			1
investigators have also been door - knocking businesses throughout the city for video surveillance footage that might help them piece together what happened to the @entity92 golfer on the night he was bashed and robbed			2
the new witness says when he returned two hours later @entity3 was still unconscious but with a bloodied face from hitting his head on a rock and accused them again of robbing his possessions four days have passed since @entity3 's attack			1
as yet local police have made no arrests and are still seeking more surveillance video to help with their investigation			1
authorities believe the spending spree on his stolen credit card is their best chance of an arrest @entity3 is disputing reports regarding conflicting details provided by a female witness to the aftermath of his alleged kidnapping , robbery and bashing on saturday morning			1
he said the injuries he suffered are proof an emotional reunion			0
@entity3 meets the homeless woman , now identified as @entity171 , at the park in @entity136 where she came to his aid at the weekend ' thank you for looking after me , ' @entity3 said to ms @entity171 when they were reunited ' it ’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true , ' @entity3 is believed to have said in text messages to the @entity181			1
' i say you only have to look at me to see the truth			0
' ' detectives are reviewing witness statements and gathering security video footage , ' @entity183 said			0
' they are also looking into recent charges made on mr @entity3 ’s credit card			1
no arrest has been made			0
' but other cctv is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where @entity3 was last seen			2
' the ( extra ) video will be very helpful , ' @entity24 captain @entity193 said			0
staff at the wine bar in which @entity3 , 43 , was last seen at about 11pm on friday said ' we ca n't say anything about that ' , when contacted by @entity25 and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night			2
with varying stories from @entity3 and @entity171 , the woman who helped the dazed and bruised @entity92 in the early hours on saturday morning , detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident			2
they are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows @entity3 leaving the @entity208 at about 11pm on the friday , with two , as yet unidentified men , and a woman			2
and more cctv footage of two men buying alcohol , apparently with the golfer 's credit card , has been taken from a store at @entity10			1
ms @entity171 ' dragged ' @entity3 to safety as he was arguing with two men in the park telling him ' you have to leave or they will kill you ' the spot where @entity3 was found ' dazed and confused '			2
' @entity222 say ' we do have video from various retail establishments , so we are looking into it ' the @entity208 in @entity136 where @entity3 was dining with friends before being bashed and robbed the @entity208 is inside the @entity227			1
it 's where @entity3 and friends were before the golfer was beaten and robbed @entity3 missed the cut at the @entity232 in @entity136 @entity3 said he could n't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed			1
capt @entity193 said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what @entity3 described as a @entity237 - style attack and kidnapping , but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards			1
police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves			0
' we do have video from various retail establishments , so we are looking into it , ' capt @entity193 said			0
' of course , if it does show individuals who are possible suspects , we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our @entity256 information			0
' but it is still very early on in our investigation			0
' capt @entity193 said @entity259 gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed			0
@entity3 was drinking with friends at the upmarket @entity208 in @entity10 on friday night and believed he was drugged , bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat , tossed in the boot of a car , robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away			0
the drama began when @entity3 was separated from his friends in the bar , caddie @entity273 and @entity274			0
an image of the intersection where @entity171 found @entity3 slumped in the gutter , bashed and trying to fend off two men @entity92 golfer @entity3 was bloodied and bruised and without his wallet and phone before being placed in a taxi back to the @entity282 by two good samaritans , an ex-military officer and @entity171 the confusion over what happened to @entity3 includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and @entity171 's claim that it was just 50 metres from the @entity208 ' i did n't think i was going to survive this one , ' @entity3 said			1
' i was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know i 'm being dumped in a park miles away			0
' i only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car			0
' that is where i got the scrapes above my eye , from the side - walk			0
' the homeless woman he referred to is believed to be ms @entity171 , who said she found and helped @entity3 a short distance away from the bar , perhaps 50 metres down the road , at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared			1
bizarrely @entity3 had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman , just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night			1
@entity3 , whose face was badly cut and bruised , announced on tuesday he would not play in this week 's @entity318 event in @entity319 , @entity320 , on the advice of his doctor			2
' this will enable me to ensure i am fully recovered prior to rejoining the @entity324 , ' he added the golfer embraced and kissed ms @entity171 , as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met , across the road from the @entity208 in @entity10 on saturday morning			0
' i really appreciate what you did , ' @entity3 told her			0
