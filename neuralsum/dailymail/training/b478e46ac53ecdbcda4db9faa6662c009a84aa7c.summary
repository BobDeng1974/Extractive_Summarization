by @entity0 published : 21:44 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 7 october 2013 urban foxes can be fed , a tv wildlife expert said last night			2
the advice from @entity5 presenter @entity4 appears to fly in the face of claims that feeding the predators makes them more of a nuisance			1
he also claimed that reports about foxes attacking humans , going up the stairs in houses and allowing themselves to be picked up were highly unlikely			1
claims : tv wildlife expert @entity4 has said that urban foxes can be fed speaking ahead of the new @entity19 series of @entity5 , he warned against ‘ demonising ’ the animals , pointing out that urban foxes were responsible for far fewer attacks than domestic dogs			1
the 52 - year - old said stories about foxes were often exaggerated due to a lack of understanding , and he warned against creating a fear of foxes			2
he added : ‘ reports have previously suggested foxes would do things that would be very alien			1
‘ for example going upstairs , allowing people to pick them up and throw them into the garden			0
that seems improbable to me			0
’ there are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the @entity40 , and mr @entity4 said it was easy for people to live alongside them and watch them from their homes			1
but he warned against feeding them too often – saying they should only be fed every now and again			0
he added : ‘ a lot of people like to feed foxes in their back gardens , to see one of the world ’s most beautiful animals from their home			0
@entity57 bandit : urban foxes thrive where food is discarded and are quick to rip open bin bags to feed ' it ’s about feeding them sporadically , not regularly , which can create dependence			2
‘ there are ways we can simply and positively treat these animals			0
' we will look at how we can live more harmoniously with them , which can only come from better understanding of their habits			0
’ mr @entity4 will follow the lives of two urban fox families in @entity5 , which starts on october 29 on @entity76 , working with the @entity77 to show how they can coexist with humans			1
speaking to the @entity80 , he said he wanted to discourage people from feeding foxes by hand or every day as they would start to associate humans with food			1
last year he said the reason why there were so many foxes was because humans in the @entity89 threw away so much food while half the world went hungry			2
he added : ‘ and the reason there are so many ? ‘ because while half the world sleeps hungry , we waste enough food to feed them all			0
‘ foxes brilliantly betray a national shame , that we ’re wasters and i do n’t suppose we like that			0

@entity4 *'s* advice flies in the face of claims that feeding foxes makes them more of a nuisance
he claims that reports about foxes attacking humans and going into houses are ' highly unlikely '
