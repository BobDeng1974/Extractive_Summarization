@entity0 admitted @entity1 did not play well in their 1 - 0 win over @entity4 but insisted that the result was all - important to secure qualification for the knock - out rounds of the @entity8			1
the @entity10 midfielder created the only goal for 19 - year - old striker @entity12 two minutes from time to settle a tight contest against @entity16 's side			1
@entity0 , who came alive during the final 10 minutes and threatened several times before the goal , said : ' it was a difficult match but we are very happy with the result and the victory today means we have already qualified and still have one match to go in the group			1
we did n't play a very good match but the last 10 minutes were better and maybe the @entity44 defence got tired and we got more space for the substitutes , who were fresh , to exploit			2
' i felt fit though - i 'm in good shape and as i often make the difference towards the end of the match it shows i am still fresh			2
' provider : @entity54 sprints straight over to hazard after the @entity10 attacker set up @entity28 vital win : hazard lifts his arms to the sky after @entity1 secured their place in the last 16 of the @entity8 @entity1 boss @entity61 said it was ' a highly tactical game ' and that he might rest players for the third game against @entity65 if they were tired or on yellow cards			1
he said : ' we were fresher , we were better and that made the difference - maybe due to our very good fitness preparations			0
' we want to be number one in the group but if there are yellow cards or for reasons of freshness i may make a decision			0
' disappointing display : @entity0 's @entity10 team - mate @entity80 offered little before he was subbed off @entity28 had come on for @entity80 after 55 minutes and the @entity10 striker trooped off the field looking hugely disappointed			1
@entity61 added : ' if he has to go off after 55 minutes he 's not happy of course - that 's natural			2
it 's not a problem , it 's normal and it happened to me as well			0
' i understand his reaction completely and i will analyse things with him , but i need all my players and the truth of today is not always the truth of tomorrow			0
' bright future : @entity1 's fans went wild as the @entity97 saw off the challenge of @entity16 's team jumping for joy : @entity1 fans celebrate in the @entity103 area on @entity104 as @entity28 scores @entity16 's @entity4 side need to beat @entity107 and hope @entity1 defeat @entity65 to have any chance of progressing , and the @entity109 insisted his players had done well			1
he said : ' frankly i am very happy with the performance the team and i thought the result was unfair			0
' the truth of the matter is we had chances to win it but we lost			0
both teams gave it their all and unfortunately it was @entity1 that was able to make it			2
' we have to look forward and i said when we came to play in this @entity8 after being absent for 12 years that this will be a great help for us to understand the level we need to be at in future competitions			0

@entity0 says the win was all that mattered after @entity1 scored late on
substitute @entity12 won the match with a goal two minutes from time
