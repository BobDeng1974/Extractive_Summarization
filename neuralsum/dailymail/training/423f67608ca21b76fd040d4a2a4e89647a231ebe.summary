he 's a big strong lad and i knew he was making the right decision			0

at 19 he has just completed his conscription in the @entity31 army ' my only regret is that i wish i 'd gone out to see him when i was a bit younger - but @entity45 had a fear of flying so we never did			0
' i think i would have loved it as much as he does			0
the cold never bothered me and i would have loved to see his farm and to help him with the animals			0
' i had a 57 - acre farm myself which @entity1 grew up on so he will definitely know what he 's doing			2
' perhaps i 'll still make it out there , you never know			0
' until then , we speak on the phone every month or so			0
it 's always good to hear his voice			0
' he might speak @entity31 now but he still sounds exactly the same to me			0
' i 'm certainly very proud of him and i 'm sure his mother would be too			0
' @entity1 signed up for @entity29 when he joined a group of @entity32 farmers exploring opportunities in @entity198 in 1992			1
the other nine in the group got cold feet and came back to @entity32 - but @entity1 was the only one to stay			2
he told the @entity201 : ' i have no regrets			0
' we have a long winter and lots of sunshine and a nice mild summer			0
' there 's plenty of fresh air and many beautiful places			0
part of the scenery : the remote village has only 15 inhabitants , who say they can no longer see any difference between themselves and the @entity40 change of scene : it has now been 20 years since mr @entity1 fled @entity26 for the far - flung village of @entity28 , three time - zones east of @entity219 escape : the farmer , pictured on the road to @entity73 , says his only sorrow is that he has lost contact with his three children from his first marriage ' in winter our days can last until midnight and there 's plenty to do , shovelling snow , cutting firewood and looking after the animals			1

' he added : ' nobody can change their own blood			0
