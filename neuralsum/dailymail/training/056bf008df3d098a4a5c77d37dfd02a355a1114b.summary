it is 11 years since it captured the imagination of a nation			0
now , space probe @entity4 is creating excitement all over again			2
the @entity7 has announced it will be giving an ‘ update ’ on the ill - fated @entity13 - led mission to @entity14 on friday – fuelling speculation that the dustbin lid - sized probe has finally been found			1
a speaker list that includes the mission ’s project manager , a scientist who help choose @entity4 ’s landing site and the @entity20 ’s director of science , has only added to the mystery			2
leading space scientist professor @entity22 said that finding the probe would be ‘ wonderful ’			2
the probe was supposed to land on the @entity14 on christmas day in 2003 professor @entity28 , who died last year from a brain haemorhage , never lived to discover what had happened to his probe a model of the @entity34 craft , which was about the size of an open umbrella , at @entity37 in @entity38 in southern @entity39 the brainchild of @entity28 , a maverick scientist with a gift for @entity43 , and built on a shoestring budget , @entity4 was designed to search for signs of life , past or present on the @entity14			1
britpop band @entity47 composed the probe ’s call sign and the ‘ test card ’ used to calibrate probes cameras was painted by @entity53			1
due to land on christmas day , 2003 , the £ 50million spacecraft was last seen heading for @entity14 six days earlier on december 19 , 2003			1
the @entity47 song was never relayed to @entity58 , the tiny craft was officially declared lost in january 2004 and nothing has been heard from it since			2
experts concluded it had fallen foul of an extra-thin @entity14 atmosphere – leading to it travelling too fast on its approach for its parachute to deploy properly and hitting the ground too hard			2
however , those involved refused to give up hope			0
dr @entity71 ’s mission manager and one of the speakers at friday ’s three - hour - long press conference , said at the time : ‘ my nightmare is that @entity4 is sat there on the surface of @entity14 still trying to talk to us and , for the sake of a broken cable , it ’s not			1
’ scientists operating the @entity84 camera on @entity86 ’s @entity85 ( @entity85 ) will take part in the press conference			0
the @entity84 camera can scan the surface of @entity14 in high enough detail to spot missing spacecraft and has already helped to locate the twin @entity94 landers which touched down on @entity14 in the @entity95			2
they have been searching for @entity4 for several years			0

@entity47 composed the probe ’s call sign musician @entity106 of @entity47 painted the ‘ test card ’ used to calibrate cameras on the probe in 2005 , professor @entity28 called an impromptu press conference , convinced that a speck on a photo of the surface of @entity14 was his lost probe			1
later , higher - resolution imagery from @entity86 showed he had been mistaken			0
he never lived to discover what had happened to his probe			0
on his death last year following a brain haemorrhage , @entity28 , 71 , was described as ‘ an archetype eccentric professor ’ – and the @entity4 mission as an ‘ heroic failure ’			1
last night , leading scientists said that the probe may , just may , have been spotted by craft orbiting @entity14			1
professor @entity22 , a former @entity127 colleague of @entity28 , said : ‘ i do n’t know what they will announce			0
all one can think of is that they might have got an image of the probe			0
‘ when dear old @entity28 was alive , he was seeing @entity4 in single pixels			2
‘ none of us could see it - he was the only one who could			0
so if they really have found it this time , it would be wonderful			0
’ the @entity4 lander was designed to look for evidence of life on @entity144 , a large , flat sedimentary basin on @entity14 @entity13 scientists used the @entity146 at @entity147 in @entity148 to search for signs of the @entity4 the professor , who had his own experiment on board @entity4 , a tiny weather station , said that while there is no chance the probe could still work , any find could provide important information about why the mission failed			1
professor @entity22 said : ‘ one of the reasons why space missions on the whole are so successful is that we do learn from experience			0
it is similar to why flying by plane is so safe - we learn from failures			0
’ dr @entity169 , a @entity13 space agency researcher , said that if @entity4 is still fairly intact , it would be visible to craft orbiting @entity14			1
fragments of wreckage , however , would be much harder to spot			0
the @entity7 will only say that friday ’s announcement concerns @entity4 ’s landing – and will ‘ definitely be of interest ’ .			1
