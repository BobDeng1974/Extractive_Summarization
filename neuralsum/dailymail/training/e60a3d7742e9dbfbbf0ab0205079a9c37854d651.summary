by @entity0 it has become the latest must - have app , and raised over $ 1m in funding - despite being described as pointless			1
however , @entity4 - which lets you send just that word to friends - has been hacked , with students claiming they can extract the phone number of any user			1
the app 's makers admit the flaw is real - and say they are ' still working ' on fixing it			1
an app called @entity4 ( logo pictured ) is currently taking the internet by storm			1
since launching in april it has amassed 50,000 users and has apparently been given $ 1 million in funding			0
the app is available to download for free on both @entity24 and @entity25 and lets users send the word yo to others - and nothing else the ' yo ' app can be downloaded from the @entity31 or @entity32 for free			1
when the app is loaded up users are asked to pick a username			2
friends can then be invited to the app by text , @entity39 or @entity40			0
when a friend 's username is added , tapping on it will send them a yo			1
they will then receive a notification saying they have received a yo - and that 's it			1
an additional feature involves adding the user ' @entity53 ' , which will then send you a yo every time a goal is scored in the 2014 @entity58 @entity57			1
but you wo n't know who scored without checking up elsewhere			0
other functionality is promised for the app in the future			0
@entity64 said it was contacted by three college students who said they had uncovered a flaw in the app. ' we can get any @entity4 user 's phone number ( i actually texted the founder , and he called me back ) , ' the students said			1
' we can spoof yos from any users , and we can spam any user ... we could also send any @entity4 user a push notification with any text we want ( though we decided not to do that )			1
' other developers have been able to recreate the flaw			0
others have claimed there are other problems - one even managing to send @entity86 pretending to be @entity87 and @entity89 boss @entity88			2
in just over two months it has gained £ 590,000 ( $ 1 million ) in funding and now has a growing userbase of about 50,000			0
according to the @entity94 the app took just eight hours to build but is quickly proving a hit with its ‘ single - tap zero character communication tool			2
’ @entity97 , the app 's creator			2
told @entity64 he was dealing with the issue , but would not elaborate further			0
' some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on , ' he said , adding that he had hired a specialist security team			0
' we are taking this very seriously			0
' similar problems have hit apps such as @entity106 and @entity107 in the past few months			0
the firm boasts that it takes 11 taps to send the word ‘ yo ’ on a rival messaging service like @entity113 compared to just two on their app. when the app is first installed you will be asked to pick a username			1
you can then add the names of friends to send them a yo ( left )			2
when a yo is sent the recipient will receive a notification that they have received it ( right ) , and nothing else			0
the company says it is a ‘ single - tap zero character communication tool ' some of the tongue - in - cheek reviews on the @entity31 were quick to eschew the apparent qualities of the app. ‘ since downloading @entity4 , all my relationships have improved and i 've regrown most of my hair , ’ said one reviewer			1
‘ receiving a yo is fast becoming the highlight of my day , ’ added another on the @entity32 store			0
‘ so much mystery ! why is this person yo - ing me ? should i respond ? ’ the initial $ 1 million for the app was supplied by investors associated with @entity145 , a ceo involved in a social network called @entity148			2
whether the app continues to wide its wave of success remains to be seen .			0
