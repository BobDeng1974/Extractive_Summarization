by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 11 october 2012 these fish - no longer than two inches long - have sparked a court case and emergency clear - up operation costing the taxpayer up to £ 205,000			2
the @entity6 launched the action after they found topmouth gudgeon , an invasive @entity10 alien species , in a private fishery that feeds into a major river in @entity13			1
despite their tiny size , the fish could have wiped out the local eco-system by mass - breeding and out - competing native rivals for food			1
it is not clear how they entered the 40 acre @entity24 fishery near @entity25 , @entity13 , although it is suspected an angler introduced them			2
deadly killers : these tiny topmouth gudgeon fish measure up to just two inches but caused mass panic when they were found in a @entity13 lake such was the concern about the potential damage , @entity34 officials spent five weeks mounting an operation to remove hundreds of native coarse fish like carp and eel from the fishery			1
after scooping them out one by one in nets , they held them in quarantine while the affected water was treated with a chemical that killed off the invasive minnows			0
these actions alone cost £ 170,000 of public money			0
meanwhile the owners of the fishery , @entity55 and @entity54 , were prosecuted for keeping non-native fish without permission under the @entity58			1
the couple were fined £ 4,950 and ordered to pay £ 30,000 costs			1
the site flows into the @entity62 which is a tributory to the @entity64 , that is rich in salmon , and its owners landed themselves in deep water after they advertised to anglers on their website that they were stocking a species of fish that turned out to also be illegal			1
danger zone : @entity73 , pictured , where the fish was found , had to have all other species pulled out of it and then chemicals added to kill the @entity10 species introduced by an angler this prompted officials from the @entity6 to pay and visit and they found no sign of the advertised fish - but did find thousands of topmouth gudgeon			1
the couple were given a period of time to remove the minnows but when agency staff returned to find nothing had been done , they took direct action themselves			0
@entity92 , a spokesman for the @entity6 , said : ' we were alerted to the fishery because they advertised that they had rosy minnow in their lakes			2
they are an invasive species , so we went to investigate but did n’t actually find any of them			0
instead , we found the topmouth gudgeon			2
' the owners had n’t put the fish in the water themselves , so they must have been carried in on an anglers equipment			0
' we warned the owners that they had to find a way to treat the problem , but when we returned that had n’t done anything about it			0
' then we decided to remove them			0
we scooped out each native fish in nets , and put them into a quarantined pond			0
' then we treated the water with a chemical that killed the topmouth gudgeon , and when the water naturally returned to normal , we introduced the fish back in to the lake			1
” dozens of non-native catfish were also found at the site , which were removed and re-homed .			0

the topmouth gudgeon could have wiped out the local eco-system after they were found in a @entity13 lake with links to the @entity64
the @entity6 took out every other species of fish by hand and then killed the *remaining* @entity10 *tiddlers*
owners of the lake , @entity55 and @entity54 , prosecuted and fined £ 4,950 and ordered to pay £ 30,000 costs despite not introducing the fish
