more than 100 @entity1 bankers will be handed £ 42million in unpaid bonuses after their employer lost a legal battle to block handouts of up to £ 1.6million each			1
@entity7 judges said today @entity8 was wrong to refuse to pay an average £ 400,000 per person at the height of the financial crisis			1
in 2009 @entity8 had saved rival @entity12 from collapse after it lost billions of pounds and had to be bailed out by @entity15 taxpayers			1
lost : @entity15 's @entity8 refused to pay 104 bankers their bonuses at the height of the financial crisis , but lost their @entity20 case today as part of the deal they took on @entity12 bankers in @entity25 and then refused to pay their 104 new staff the £ 42million bonus pot they had been promised by their ailing former employer			1
refusal : the bankers ( file picture ) were to receive up to £ 1.6m from their previous employer , which had to be bailed out the legal battle over the cash has lasted four years , but @entity36 judges today found in favour of the bankers and said that the decision was a breach of contract by @entity8 , and they must now pay the cash in full			1
a panel comprising of @entity44 sitting with lord justice @entity45 , vice president of the @entity7 , and @entity47 said they rejected the bank 's concerns case			0
their decision upheld a previous @entity36 ruling last may saying that the bankers were entitled to the cash @entity8 had argued that the judge had not treated their arguments objectively , and that it was artificial to treat the promised bonuses distinct from financial performance			1
at a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses the 104 bankers			2
had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a guaranteed bonus pool announced by @entity69 in august 2008			0
as well as being ordered to pay the bonuses @entity8 have been left with a legal bill estimated at £ 5 million for a hearing lasting more than three weeks			1
they will also face the costs of a three day appeal which could add another £ 500,000 to their legal bill			2
decision : judges at the @entity36 found that it was a breach of contract not to pay the £ 42m promised a @entity8 spokesman said : ' @entity8 is disappointed with this decision and is considering its legal options			1
it is a regrettable outcome in view of the on - going regulatory , public and shareholder calls to establish a sound relationship between banks ' performance and variable remuneration			0
' it remains the @entity92 's belief that as a matter of law , no binding contractual commitment was made , that bonus amounts communicated were provisional and that it was reasonable and rational to reduce the bonuses in the light of the 6.5bn euro loss that @entity12 's investment banking operation posted for 2008			2
' in other jurisdictions , national courts upheld @entity8 's position			0
in october 2011 the highest court in @entity15 , the @entity106 , ruled in @entity8 's favour on the same case for employees whose contracts fell under @entity15 employment law in the third and last instance			0
' in @entity114 and @entity115 , the bank succeeded in having claims with the same facts dismissed			0
in @entity120 arbitration proceedings earlier this year , the claims were rejected			0
' ' the individual claims range from 15,000 euros to 2 million euros , with the total claim amounting to 50 million euros - £ 42 million			0
' it was claimed the bonus pool was created to keep staff but they only received 10 per cent of what they were promised and launched the legal action to get the missing 90 per cent			2
' but the @entity92 claimed that under a @entity131 clause and because there was a deterioration in the bank 's performance they were entitled to reduce bonus payouts			0

staff were promised up to £ 1.6million each at the height of the financial crisis
the 104 worked for @entity12 , which was *bought* by @entity8
@entity8 then refused to pay the cash , starting a four - year legal battle
@entity20 finds that blocking bonuses was wrong , and they must pay
