the emails that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of @entity6 , @entity0 were released on thursday			1

' in the other emails president @entity11 is labelled a monkey , welfare recipients are described as ' lazy ' and unable to speak @entity18 before being compared to dogs and black individuals are first lady @entity21 is called a tribeswoman			1
the caption underneath reads ; ' rare photo of @entity43 babysitting @entity11 in early 1962			1

' all three were removed from their jobs after the emails were discovered			2

' last week i went to sign my dogs up for welfare			2
at first the lady said , ' dogs are not elgible to draw welfare			2
' so i explained to her that my dogs are mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak @entity18 , and have no frigging clues who their daddies are			1
they expect me to feed them , provide them with housing and medical care			0
so she looked in her policy book to see what it takes to qualify			0
my dogs get their first checks friday			0
damn , this is a great country ! ! ' i be anxious to hear what she say , and bout the ' spression on her face , ' says the father			0
when she returns , he asks his daughter ; ' now what yo momma say about that ? ' the girl replies , ' she say to tell you that " you ai n't my daddy " and what the ' spression on your face			0
' there is then a photo of a black man who is missing almost all of his teeth screaming ' lawd a @entity109 ! ! ! ! ! ' what 's more , at the bottom it says ; ' a smile is contagious , pass it around			1
' @entity58 also sent an email that showed a group of tribespeople in costumes dancing with the subject line ' simply beautiful , ' and wrote ; ' @entity21 's high school reunion			1
' @entity58 is also responsible for sending an email called ' @entity122 , ' saying ; ' this is pretty funny stuff			1
' to the question ' are there too many immigrants in @entity127 ? ' the email says that 72 % responded ; ' i am not understanding the question please			0
' another says a man converted to @entity133 so he could stone his wife to death after she cheated , and there are numerous references to pedophilia and sex with underage girls			0
' went to the pub with my girlfriend last night			0
locals were shouting " pedophile ! " and other names at me just because my girlfriend is 21 and i 'm 50 , ' says the email at one point			0
' it completely spoiled our 10th anniversary			0
an email sent by @entity32 to @entity58 and then forwarded on by @entity58 to unknown recipients is about a black woman getting an abortion in @entity155			1
' two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000 , ' reads the email			1
' she phoned the hospital to ask who it was from			0
' it then closes by saying ; ' the hospital said , ' @entity162 , " ' in another , @entity32 writes to @entity164 about getting his dogs on welfare as they ' are mixed in color , unemployed , lazy , ca n't speak @entity18 , and have no frigging clues who their daddies are			1
' he adds ; ' they expect me to feed them , provide them with housing and medical care			0
' @entity32 then says at this point the worker went to see if his dogs qualified for @entity179			1
' my dogs get their first checks friday , ' he wrote after that			0
' damn , this is a great country ! ! ! ! ' the only email sent by captain @entity9 meanwhile was the aforementioned one about president @entity11			1
president @entity11 ( above ) has not commented yet on the emails released on thursday analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records in @entity6 last month found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in @entity6 , an unnamed department official said			1
a black woman in @entity155 was admitted into the hospital [ for ] pregnancy termination			1
two weeks later she received a check for $ 5,000			1
she phoned the hospital to ask who it was from			0
the hospital said , ‘ @entity162			2
’ the @entity204 report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black			2
according to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014 , blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops , though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers			0
what 's more , charges for minor violations such as ' manner of walking in roadway ' disproportionately affected black residents and were used ' not as a public service , but as a tool for raising revenue			2
' @entity225 protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of @entity228 in @entity6 , @entity229 and @entity230 laid bare racial tensions and what president @entity11 called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities			1
black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops , compared to their white counterparts			0
the @entity204 plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with @entity6 officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change			2
previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the @entity204 and installing federal monitors to oversee operations			2
the report 's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in @entity6			2
but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the @entity6 police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict @entity265 's killer , officer @entity264			1
after a separate investigation , the @entity204 decided not to pursue federal charges against @entity264 , who has said he acted in self - defense			0
' what it shows is that a culture existed and was allowed to fester in @entity6 municipal government and @entity273			2
what we have seen so far is a few voluntary resignations but not a full acceptance of responsibility for that culture that has been allowed to exist in that municipal government , ' @entity275 official @entity274 said of the emails			0
' even after the @entity204 report			0
there is still a lot of work to be done and it still remains to be seen whether the people who remain in power will be the ones to make the change			0
