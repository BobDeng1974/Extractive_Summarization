australians using surrogates in @entity6 could also be prosecuted for human trafficking under the new laws that ban surrogacy if the prospective parents are n't blood relatives			1
lawyer @entity1 called the changes ' appalling ' and said his clients have been left with no way to contact the pregnant woman carrying their babies , after the @entity6 military allegedly confiscated medical records from @entity27 clinics			1
' i 've been contacted by parents who ca n't contact the surrogate parents midway through pregnancy			0
they ca n't find out whether their baby or the mother is ok , ' mr @entity1 told @entity35			2
' it 's a disaster how the @entity6 government have announced it			2
' these children did n't ask to born in this mess , ' he explained			0
mr @entity1 spoke out on the same day that it was revealed a @entity6 surrogate mother revealed she was forced to care for her six - month - old baby after an @entity3 couple refused to take him home once they found out he had down syndrome			1
the @entity3 had paid 21 - year - old @entity47 $ 11,700 to give them a baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl home to @entity3			1

the @entity6 surrogate mother has received more than $ 182,000 in donations to care for @entity55 after he was abandoned mr @entity1 said all the @entity3 couples he 'd met only seek overseas surrogacy as a last resort because @entity3 laws are so restrictive			1
' the laws here makes it almost impossible			0
you ca n't advertise , you ca n't get an egg donor			0
some people have waited seven years			0
' he explained that parents who were unable to conceive naturally , cancer patients and gay couples came to him after all other avenues had been exhausted			0

over 400 @entity3 children were born in @entity6 between 2012 - 2013 and 600 were born in @entity79			1

now the @entity82 have said there wo n't be any overseas surrogacy allowed at all , ' mr @entity1 explained			2
baby boy @entity55 has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell he said this will cause more pressure on the @entity3 surrogacy system , plus parents will end up spending over $ 100,000 to get treatment in the @entity91 or @entity92			1
it is cheaper to have a surrogate child in @entity6 and @entity79 at around $ 80,000			2

' suddenly the @entity82 had a crackdown			0
they are fearing a loss of face because of that story and they want to be seen as tough , ' mr @entity1 said			2
the lawyer , who is based in @entity112 but works with @entity3 who are trying to have children from every state , said he wants the @entity3 government to take active steps with @entity6 authorities to make sure people who have signed contracts with pregnant surrogates can get their children back to @entity3			1
' what i would hate to see is these babies stuck in a @entity6 orphanage or people prosecuted for child trafficking offences for something that has been legal for years , ' he added			2
the @entity3 couple who have abandoned @entity130 remain anonymous but they reportedly told ms @entity47 to have an abortion when they found out four - months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had down syndrome			1
the @entity3 couple , who have remained anonymous , reportedly told ms @entity138 to have an abortion ' i would like to tell @entity6 women – do n't get into this business as a surrogate			1
do n't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society , then we have to take responsibility for that , ' ms @entity47 said , the @entity143 reports			2
the couple paid an extra $ 1673 when they first realised - three - months into the pregnancy - that ms @entity47 was having twins for them			1
ms @entity47 is a @entity157 and thinks abortion is a ' sin '			2
she originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family 's financial problems and the arrangement was set - up through an agency			1
the @entity3 man and his ethnic - @entity168 wife could not conceive a baby themselves			0
ms @entity170 , from a village in @entity172 in northern @entity6 , gave birth to @entity55 and his twin sister in @entity176 hospital			1
however , when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the @entity3 couple who ms @entity170 has never met			1
she never received the remaining $ 2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive			0
a hope for @entity55 campaign has been set up on @entity184 and has now smashed its $ 25,000 target after receiving more than $ 50,000			0
the page pleads : ' 6 month old baby @entity55 was born in @entity187 with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition			2
he was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young @entity6 woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment			1
' please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life			0
all monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of @entity130			0
' ms @entity138 , 21 , agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family 's financial problems one doctor has donated $ 3,000 to the cause			1

the claims were made by the @entity249 group ' help us bring the @entity251			0

current @entity3 @entity268 policy forbids @entity268 rebates for @entity27 use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in @entity3 the following conditions must be fulfilled : many @entity3 have flocked to @entity6 over the years because the rules were far less strict			1
