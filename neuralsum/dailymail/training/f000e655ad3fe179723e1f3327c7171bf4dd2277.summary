a @entity1 flight hit by a 22 - hour delay from @entity3 , @entity4 , to @entity5 , saw passengers celebrating the @entity7 on the beach instead of in the air			1
the flight was due to depart from @entity3 at 4.10pm local time on @entity11 and fly overnight to arrive in @entity12 at 7.05 am on @entity13			2
but instead , passengers spent @entity11 in a hotel on @entity4 's @entity16 coast , after problems with the scheduling of cabin staff for the plane , apparently being delayed in @entity21 , meant the aircraft was left sitting on the runway			1
speaking to @entity41 , father @entity26 , who had spent two weeks in the the five - star star all - inclusive @entity44 , said : ' when we came down for breakfast on the day of departure , our tour guide came over and told us that the flight had been delayed			0
' when she said by 22 hours i thought she was joking at first ; but in the end it meant we got an extra day of holiday			0
the family were treated to live dolphin shows at their hotel , and were able to sneak in an extra performance with an extra day of holiday handed to them , the @entity60 begin to set up their beach spot ' i 'm not totally sure what the problem was ; we were told the staff had been held up in @entity21 , but it was crazy as the plane was just sitting there with nowhere to go			1
' we were taken off to another hotel in @entity3 , and the extra day we spent by the swimming pool , exploring @entity3 , and getting some last - minute sun - the temperature was around 30 degrees			0
' incredibly , last year on their trip to annual @entity77 trip to @entity4 , the @entity31 , father @entity26 , mother @entity79 and sons @entity80 and @entity82 , were delayed 24 hours at @entity5 due to flood problems			1
their desperation to make it to the airport had seen the family of four take a taxi all the way from their home in @entity36 to @entity5 - a 70 - mile journey and a £ 150 fare to boot			1
@entity26 added : ' last year was the full 24 - hour , full - day delay , so i suppose this time we 're two hours better off ! it was n't a bad way to spend @entity11 as the @entity31 got the chance to sun themselves on the beach it 's not a bad thing when a flight delay means an extra day 's stay in @entity3 , @entity4 ' it 's some contrast though ; from travelling in a taxi to the airport to be told the flight is delayed last year and put up in an airport hotel , to getting an extra day in the @entity4 sun this year			1
' we really love this part of @entity4 , i would highly recommend a family holiday here , so getting an extra day , despite the flight delay , is n't all bad			1
the family 's flight out of @entity3 was yesterday ( thursday ) at 4.10pm local time , landing back in the @entity121 at 7.27am this morning			0
@entity41 have contacted @entity1 for comment regarding the delayed flight , and are awaiting a response			0
a spokesperson for @entity1 told @entity41 : ' @entity126 would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers travelling on flight @entity129 from @entity3 , @entity4 to @entity5			2
' the aircraft operating this flight was delayed on another route and as a result the flight had to be delayed further , due to mandatory crew rest restrictions			2
' @entity1 provided customers with overnight accommodation and meals in a hotel in @entity3			0
all customers are now back in the @entity121 after the aircraft landed at @entity5 airport at 07.27 today ( friday )			0
' we would like to reassure customers that delays of this length are extremely rare			0
