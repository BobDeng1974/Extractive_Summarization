in @entity2 's long and illustrious history , there is no such thing as a routine victory			2
this club thrives on the thrill of the chase			0
they are programmed to do everything the hard way and here at @entity12 , in this third round replay against @entity14 , there was no exception			1
they set themselves the most strenuous test , conceding twice within the opening seven minutes against @entity20 's spirited @entity14 team			2
spurs got there in the end			0
@entity2 midfielder @entity23 ( right ) slips as he scores his side 's opening goal of their @entity27 third round replay on wednesday night @entity14 goalkeeper @entity28 throws himself down to his left but he ca n't keep out the @entity31 's low effort @entity2 midfielder @entity32 ( left ) blasts @entity2 level with a powerful effort from outside @entity14 's penalty area @entity36 international @entity32 screams with delight after levelling the scores at @entity12 just before half - time @entity2 defender @entity40 ( left ) nods in from close - range after a perfect cross from fellow goalscorer @entity23 @entity40 ( left ) gestures to the @entity12 crowd after netting his second goal for @entity2 since joining in 2013 @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity46 ; @entity40 6.5 ( @entity47 80 ) , @entity48 5.5 , @entity49 5 , @entity50 6 ; @entity32 6.5 , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 7 ( @entity53 76 ) , @entity23 7.5 , @entity54 7 ( @entity55 59mins , 6 ) 6 ) ; @entity56 5			1

subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 goals : @entity76 3 , @entity74 8 manager : @entity20 6 booked : @entity71 , @entity68 @entity85 : @entity23 referee : @entity87 6 their recovery means that from the moment @entity64 's team set foot at @entity12 on saturday for a 3pm kick off against @entity94 , @entity2 will begin a treacherous run of five games in 15 days in three competitions			1
dare it be said , with a @entity99 semi-final against @entity101 to come , an @entity27 tie with @entity102 and a shot at fourth place in the @entity105 , they are a successful outfit			1
this is what the players are in the business for and @entity2 deserve to be in the fourth round after this impressive , yet ultimately comfortable , comeback			1
@entity2 's manager had fiddled with his formation , mixing things up after their setback at @entity116 on saturday , where they were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity119			1
to play @entity120 in place of @entity58 , to promote @entity122 to orthodox left wing and to swap @entity56 for the 18 goals of @entity61 takes some time to acclimatise to			2
by the end , when they were 4 - 2 up and turning their attentions to saturday 's clash with @entity94 , they looked the business			1
to @entity64 's credit there was even a nod in the direction of the long - term future of the club when he sent on young @entity53 for the final 14 minutes			1
there is much more to come from him			0
back to @entity14 and the incredible and the opening seven minutes of this third round replay			2
they went in front after two minutes when @entity76 's corkscrew beat @entity120 from distance and added another when @entity74 's free - kick was guided into the net off the shoulder of @entity56			1
it was an eventful evening for the @entity2 striker			0
in the great pantheon of misses , the moment @entity56 hit the crossbar from a few yards out with the goal at his mercy is right up there with @entity157 at @entity158 in 1992			0
the @entity2 forward has form for this , somehow skying a routine cross in a @entity162 tie against @entity163 in february last year			0
which was worse ? it 's a tough call			0
still , there was something positive about his game , playing his part in the ninth - minute goal that prompted @entity2 ' comeback at @entity12			2
@entity122 slides in to poke the ball beyond @entity28 and give @entity2 a 4 - 2 lead on home soil @entity176 celebrates as summer signing @entity51 ( right ) runs to join him down by the corner flag @entity14 striker @entity76 smashes the visitors into the lead with a stunning left - foot strike past @entity2 goalkeeper @entity120 @entity76 is congratulated by his team - mate @entity70 ( left ) after finding the back of the net in just the third minute @entity14 winger @entity74 ( left ) bends home a free - kick to give @entity20 's side a two - goal advantage at @entity12 former @entity94 star @entity74 watches on as his free - kick takes a deflection off striker @entity56 before finding the net @entity74 is lifted up by team - mate @entity65 as @entity14 's players celebrate extending their lead against @entity2 from @entity52 's cross down the right , @entity56 's flick on fell to @entity23 and the @entity31 midfielder chested the ball down and volleyed beyond @entity28			1
there was a sense then that the comeback was on , that this @entity2 team would begin to stir after the impressive move that led to that opening goal			0
after @entity56 blew his big chance , @entity32 equalised on the stroke of half - time with a well - placed effort that beat @entity28 from distance			1
when they emerged for the second half , the impetus was with @entity2 and their fans dreaming of @entity213 in the @entity214			0
it is too soon to check the availability of @entity217 , but there will be a few among that number forecasting their ninth @entity27 win in may			0
there is way to go yet , particularly with the development of this team			0
@entity76 took his early chance , scoring for the first time since his move to @entity229 on a free transfer from nearby @entity231 last summer			2
his career has plateaued in recent seasons , struggling to make an impression at the @entity235 following his Â£ 3m move from @entity237 and farmed out on loan to @entity239 last season			0
back in @entity241 he took his chance for @entity20 's side , taking advantage of the customary confusion in @entity2 's defence when @entity247 and @entity48 failed to clear			1
spurs wobbled again , conceding a second when @entity74 's left - foot free kick deflected off @entity56 and beat diving figure of @entity46			1
what a start for this @entity14 side , making the running and roared on by a few hundred brave supporters clad in claret and blue who made the trip south			2
their ambitions to win here ended at the start of the second half when @entity40 scored their third goal in the 48th minute			0
@entity20 claimed a corner was incorrectly given , launching into the fourth official and yelling at him that there was little point having radio contact with referee @entity270 if he did n't use it			0
the goal appeared telepathic , with @entity40 arriving at the far post to head in @entity23 's corner			2
spurs scored again when @entity56 set up @entity54 , steaming into the penalty area , to apply the finishing touch at the far post			0
they are safely through , but @entity2 can not resist the odd scare			0
@entity282 striker @entity56 ( right ) somehow manages to hit the bar from close - range when it appeared easier to score @entity2 defender @entity40 ( right ) keeps his eyes on the ball under pressure from @entity14 striker @entity77 managers @entity20 ( left ) and @entity64 react on the touchline during a dramatic opening period in their @entity27 replay @entity2 captain @entity48 shouts at his defensive partner @entity247 as tempers flared in north @entity241			1

@entity76 gave @entity14 the lead after just three minutes with a stunning left - foot strike
@entity74 *doubled* the visitors ' advantage with a deflected free - kick after 10 minutes
@entity31 midfielder @entity23 pulled one back for @entity2 before @entity32 equalised just before half - time
@entity2 took the lead through @entity40 ' header early in the second half
@entity64 's side took full control when @entity122 made it 4 - 2 after 52 minutes
@entity2 will face @entity102 at @entity12 in the @entity27 fourth round
