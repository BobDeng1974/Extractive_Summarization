@entity2 ' @entity1 curtain - raiser with @entity3 is bound to be a bone - crushing affair to get the tournament started			1
while the match at the @entity8 in @entity9 is set to be a fast - paced tussle , fine details are likely to separate the two sides			2
@entity2 head coach @entity12 and his @entity3 counterpart @entity13 will have both devised a gameplan to win the game on friday night			1
here , @entity17 assesses the crucial elements of where the match will be won or lost for either side			0
the midfield gain line - stand up @entity22 @entity2 ’ famous ‘ @entity24 ’ strategy is basically pretty simple			2
it ’s based around power runners blasting holes in the opposition defence and forcing their way across the gain line to give the pack momentum			0
in @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity2 have a midfield with a combined weight of more than 33 stone who are capable of off - loading out of the tackle for supporting runners to surge forward			2
@entity2 will look to use the brute force of @entity32 ( centre ) to create gaps in the @entity3 midfield at just 13st 3lb , @entity3 fly - half @entity22 is certain to be targeted by the @entity46 centres while @entity3 centres @entity47 and @entity48 will need to ‘ get in the faces ’ of their opposite numbers in defence to stop @entity46 attacks before they reach the gain line			1
@entity47 is also the quickest of the four men and will look to exploit a weakness in @entity33 ’ defence on the outside , which @entity58 took advantage of ruthlessly last summer			0
@entity3 will hope centre @entity47 's speed will exploit a weakness in @entity33 ’ defence the scrum - no excuses for @entity3 this time the last time @entity3 visited the @entity8 they were heavily penalised at the scrum by referee @entity66 and their game disintegrated without a set - piece platform			2
@entity3 were left incensed and frustrated by some of @entity71 ’s decisions			0
friday night ’s @entity73 referee @entity72 is renowned as an excellent referee of the scrum and @entity3 will have no excuses if they come off second best again			1
picking @entity77 at tighthead prop in place of the injured @entity80 following a six - week lay - off is a gamble by @entity13 but @entity3 will be hoping the experienced @entity83 3 can have a bigger scrummaging impact than the @entity2 tighthead prop @entity85			1
@entity3 prop @entity77 will start against @entity2 despite only recovering from a six - week injury lay - off discipline - keep calm , @entity87 @entity13 places a huge emphasis on discipline but @entity3 ’s has not been brilliant in recent times			1
they were heavily penalised in the defeat by @entity58 last autumn when @entity92 was sent to the sin - bin in the second half for a petulant stamp			0
the @entity3 hooker is sure to be on the receiving end of some @entity46 provocation tonight and if he can keep his cool his side will benefit			0
if @entity3 are to stand a chance against @entity2 , then hooker @entity92 must be able to keep his discipline kicking game - @entity102 hard and keep your nerve fly - half @entity107 impressed in the autumn with the variety of his kicking game , while scrum - half @entity112 is also considered a fine box kicker			1
@entity3 must chase well or risk the likes of @entity116 and @entity117 returning with interest			2
kicking at goal is sure to be key and will also be linked to discipline			0
if @entity3 concede penalties in their own half then @entity121 is sure to punish them as one of the world ’s best goal - kickers			0
@entity22 , who is in the infancy of his international career , has been working with @entity130 ’s kicking mentor , @entity129 , and he faces the biggest challenge of his career on friday night			1
he will never have kicked in such a hostile environment			0
@entity2 full - back @entity121 ( right ) is one of the world 's best goal - kickers and could punish @entity3 the breakdown - channel no 7 the debate over whether @entity138 is an out - and - out no 7 is unlikely to die down soon but @entity2 have no doubts over @entity141 ’s openside credentials			1
@entity138 got the better of his man at @entity143 last year and @entity3 ’s work in this area will be boosted by @entity77 ’s return			0
@entity147 has been dominant in this area for @entity149 this season and @entity3 will look to their in - form no 6 to help speed up ball recycling in attack and slow down @entity46 ball in defence			0
every attacking side needs quick ball to flourish and both sides will be desperate for it on friday night			1
@entity3 will hope that @entity147 ( right ) will be able provide them quick ball when in attack on friday the coaches @entity12 ’s been there and done it @entity12 has a significant edge over @entity162 in terms of experience but a six - year contract signed last year by the @entity3 head coach leaves him knowing he has time on his side in the job			2
both sides will look to spring surprises in attack and defence with the smallest advantage set to make a difference			0
@entity2 head coach @entity12 ( left ) will be looking to get one over @entity3 counterpart @entity13 is the roof important ? not really			1
the forecast is chilly but dry and with the @entity8 ’s steep sides the wind should not be a huge factor			0
arguably the game could be faster with the fresher air which will not cause dew to form on the pitch as can happen with the roof on			0
@entity3 are clearly concerned about communication with decibel levels set to match a jet fighter flying at 50 feet , and having the roof open will allow some noise to dissipate			1
the roof at the @entity8 in @entity9 will remain open for the @entity1 opener on friday night			1

wales take on @entity3 in the @entity1 opener on friday night
the midfield battle is set to be a key component to the match
@entity3 must chase their kicks well to stop @entity2 *counter-attacking* *threat*
