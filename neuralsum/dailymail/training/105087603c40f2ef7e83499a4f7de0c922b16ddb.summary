scientists have warned massive agricultural expansion in @entity2 could lead to a ' perfect storm ' for human plague transmission by encouraging an increase in the number of disease - carrying rats			1
a new study published yesterday in the @entity9 of @entity10 and @entity11 by researchers from the @entity13 found that the expansion of crop lands by 70 per cent over recent years has caused the number of plague - carrying rodents to double			1
rats which live in human areas are also particularly competent hosts for plague and are more likely to interact with humans , increasing the chance of humans being bitten by plague - infected fleas			2
these rats transmit deadly diseases to humans , including @entity41 fever and plague			1
@entity43 , a @entity13 professor and a lead author of the study , said : ' we found that introducing maize production in natural areas appears to create a perfect storm for plague transmission			1
' local farmers often then store this harvested corn next to or inside their homes - baiting in the hungry field rats and increasing opportunities for human infection			2
' these kinds of conditions are what breed outbreaks			0
' the report warned these numbers could rise as new wilderness areas become farmland and rat populations increase			2
though less deadly than @entity66 or other epidemics , plague â€“ caused by the bacterium @entity70 is fatal in more than 30 percent of cases if left untreated , the study said			1
the bubonic plague remains one of the most destructive pandemics in history which peaked in @entity76 between 1348 and 1350 as @entity37 's population soars , and food demand increases , scientists , farmers and politicians will have to balance the need for more farmland with concerns over the spread of disease , the scientists added			1
most of the plague outbreaks recorded since 2000 have taken place in @entity37			1
a recent outbreak in @entity92 saw 263 people infected and 71 deaths			2
in @entity2 , there have been over 8,000 cases over the last 30 years , including 675 deaths , @entity95 reported			0
the scientists studied three areas of northern @entity2 where plague outbreaks have been documented in the past and where maize production has expanded over recent times			2
concluding , the authors said : ' lessons learned from this case are also broadly important for understanding the dynamics of other zoonotic diseases in this era of rapid landscape change			0
' bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history , having killed around 100million people during the ' @entity117 ' in the 14th @entity118 and paintings from the outbreak , which wiped out about a third of the @entity76 population , depict town criers saying ' bring out your dead ' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses			1
it is caused by a bacterium known as @entity70 , which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats			0
the disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin , armpits or neck , known as ' buboes '			0
it kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated , although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive			0
after the @entity117 arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in @entity76 , with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century			2
bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world , with 90 per cent of all cases now found in @entity37			1
however , there have been a few non-fatal cases in the @entity154 in recent years , while in august 2013 a 15 - year - old boy died in @entity156 after eating a groundhog infected with the disease			0
three months later , an outbreak in a @entity160 killed at least 20 people in a week			1
a year before 60 people died as a result of the infection , more than in any other country in the world			0
outbreaks in @entity168 have been rare in recent years , and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west			0
@entity168 's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of @entity177 in 2009 , and one in @entity178 in 2012			0
in the @entity154 between five and 15 people die every year as a result , mostly in western states .			0

expansion of crops has caused 20-fold increase in population of @entity37 rat
rodent is carrier of the plague and @entity41 fever - which is similar to @entity66
scientists warn this *combination* is a ' perfect storm ' for a plague outbreak
bubonic plague killed around 100 million people during the 14th century
