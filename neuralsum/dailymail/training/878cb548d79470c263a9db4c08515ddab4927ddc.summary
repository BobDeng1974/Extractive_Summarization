by @entity0 wedding guests can breathe a sigh of relief - no more sitting through endless wedding photos and a four - hour long video of the big day			1
but instead they might find themselves having to lip - sync along to romantic hits such as ' @entity9 ' and ' i 've had the time of my life ' while in their wedding finery			1
welcome to ' marryoke ' - the latest must - have for couple planning their @entity15			2
it 's marriage - plus karaoke			0
the footage is then cleverly interwoven with video of all the traditional features of the happy day , from the groom waiting at the altar for his bride , to the wedding ceremony and onto the reception afterwards			1
it 's supposed to be the happiest day of your life , so there 's no wonder that newly - weds have always wanted to have a permanent record of the day			0
but marryoke is certainly a step up from a formal photo on the steps of the church			0
' there has been a real shift in wedding 's recently , ' says marryoke maker @entity57			0
' people are constantly looking for something that 's unique so there 's a real competitive element going on			0
people search for something different at their weddings , whether it 's with the flowers , or the cake , the wedding favours or the video			1
there 's also a social media element where people want to upload photos and videos of the day on @entity76 or @entity77			1
' ready for her close - up : bride @entity80 poses for her marryoke video before marrying @entity82 husband and wife team @entity57 and @entity84 set up their company @entity85 three years ago having made a wedding video for some friends as a present			1
it got 50,000 hits when they uploaded it onto @entity77 and they realised that they were onto something			2
a few months later they made a couple of marryoke videos for music producer @entity97 and his wife @entity98 and , aided by the appearance of @entity100 , got more than two million hits			0
the couple , based in @entity103 , now spend their time travelling off to exotic locations such as @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
husband and wife marryoke team @entity57 and @entity84 may say they work hard to make each video special ' there are all kinds of crazy things at weddings nowaways , ' says @entity57			0
' we 've seen elephants , magicians , helicopters , secret singers - all sorts			0
' the @entity126 will be at a wedding from make - up and hair styling at the very beginning of the day to dancing until the early hours			2
as well as doing marryokes they also make traditional 40 - minute wedding videos and a three - minute highlights package			1
' people are becoming less bothered about recording the speeches and the vows and are more interested in putting the highlights package on @entity76 , ' says @entity57			2
as for the songs , people tend to stay away from the traditionally romantic tunes in favour of high - energy pop songs , including @entity145 and @entity146 .			1

traditional wedding videos being shunned in favour of three - minute pop videos which can be easily *shared* on @entity76 and @entity77
popular tracks include i got ta feeling and @entity146
weddings *increasingly* competitive as couples search for *novelty* to *impress* their guests
