@entity1 boss @entity0 was frustrated with his side 's defensive lapses after the @entity1 crashed to a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity5 on monday night			1
@entity8 's double meant @entity7 's men took all three points from their trip to @entity11 's			2
but @entity0 seemed to have recovered by tuesday , wearing his @entity13 jumper before the @entity1 ' festive bash and tweeting : ready for the @entity13 at @ southamptonfc i believe in the way we played			1
@entity0 's men dominated the match against @entity5 for large parts but some costly defensive lapses handed the visitors the game with the @entity1 crashing to their third defeat in just over a week			1
' we did everything , we created chances			0
but we also made mistakes , ' said the @entity48			0
' maybe they [ @entity5 ] made more mistakes than we did but they have players who handle those kind of mistakes and that was the difference today			2
@entity8 ( top ) intercepted @entity56 's poor pass to fire past @entity57 for the opening goal @entity59 ( right ) pounced in the 71st minute to put @entity5 back in front and secure the points for @entity5 ' at this level detail makes the difference in football			1
you can talk about who deserved it , who played offensively , who pressed , but everything is s * * * because we lost			0
' i said to my players , we did not lose against @entity5 tonight ; we lost by ourselves			2
' @entity0 remained upbeat despite his side 's recent slump in form and insisted that his team would continue with their playing style that has yielded such positive results thus far			2
@entity59 is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate his strike in front of the away supporters despite three consecutive losses to @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity5 , @entity1 hold o nto fifth place in the @entity90 table , and @entity0 believes there is still grounds for optimism heading into the @entity13 period			1
' i like to see my team playing football in the way that we 've started this season , ' he added			0
' if we lose or we win , that 's our way of playing because i believe in that way of playing even now when we 've lost the last three games			0
' ( @entity106 ) @entity85 were the much better team but we deserved more against @entity86 , we deserve much more tonight but we made mistakes			0
' if you give players like @entity59 those kind of mistakes , he will punish you , for sure			0
