by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:44 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 11:41 est , 3 october 2012 @entity2 today said he wants builders , plumbers and mechanics to stand as @entity6 in a further escalation of his attempt to draw a class divide with @entity11 ’s @entity10			2
the @entity13 leader said he wanted fewer ‘ middle class ’ candidates standing for his party in 2015			1
and he renewed his attacks on the competence of the government , branding ministers ‘ useless ’			2
labour leader @entity2 took questions from party members on the fourth day of his conference in @entity24 party members were so keen to ask a question they went to great lengths to attract his attention			1
delegates were seen waving umbrellas , crutches , flags and even cuddly toys to catch his eye			1
one construction worker , wielding a hard hat , called for more builders , plumbers , mechanics and shop workers to be selected as @entity13 candidates in winnable seats			1
mr @entity2 backed the idea and said it was ‘ something that i have made a bigger feature of my leadership ’			2
he added : ‘ i am not going to start saying we are going to decide who the candidates are but we do have a responsibility to make sure it is not just people from middle class backgrounds to into the contest			1
you have more absolute commitment			2
‘ we are right to say we need more women and we need 50 per cent of our mps being women in my view , that is the only way we can be a truly representative country			2
we need to be more diverse in terms of ethnic diversity			2
‘ but it is also got to be more diverse in terms of class background			1
’ @entity69 , the shadow cabinet office minister , is reviewing how the party chooses candidates			1
queuing app : delegates at the conference try to catch the eye of @entity13 leader using old methods and new @entity2 's conference speech drew heavily on the @entity80 theme of @entity10 prime minister @entity81			1
but today lord @entity82 admitted he did no know who the conservative was			1
he told @entity87 's @entity86 : ' you know me , i 'm not an intellectual			2
who the hell 's @entity91 ? ' the @entity94 changes			1
@entity2 did a brilliant speech there			2
' mr @entity2 unveiled what was described as @entity13 , noting that @entity81 gave a famous three - hour speech on the subject in 1842 at the @entity100 , just yards from where the @entity13 conference is being held			1
lord @entity82 added : ' we 've had @entity104 , @entity105 , all sorts of @entity13			1
i 'm just @entity13 - traditional values in a modern setting			1
' i 'm the old man in this , but i still think when he talks about the health service , about getting our people back to work and making the changes , having a go at the banks - it sounds like traditional values to me			0
' speaking at a fringe meeting today , mr @entity69 , a former plumber , said : ‘ we need to rebuild our party in the image of the rest of the nation			2
' this means redressing the problem of working class representation			0
let me just say this , 7 per cent of the population went to a public school but 35 per cent of @entity6 went to a public school – five times as many as in the wider population			0
we have to make sure we reverse the trend we have seen			0
’ mr @entity2 has been accused of using class attacks on mr @entity11 , using a party political broadcast and his main conference speech to highlight his education at a comprehensive school while the prime minister went to @entity143			1
in interviews today he seemed to be rowing back , insisting : ‘ i am not making an issue of @entity11 ’s background			2
’ however , his announcement that he wants class background to be a consideration when select candidates will fuel speculation that he will target the upbringing and wealth of the @entity154 at the next election			1
he was challenged over his support for public sector freezes and tuition fees , and @entity13 environment policy			1
and he revealed he would attend a union march against spending cuts on october 20 , accusing the government of an ' arrogant ' approach to public services			1
' there has got to be an end to a style of government which is just arrogant and high - handed , ' he said			0
' it does n't mean that there wo n't be disagreements between public servants and a @entity13 government but it does mean that you have got to be able to listen			1
' and this government is just totally unable to listen and just behaves in an incredibly high - handed way			0
' mr @entity2 's new slogan appears to have caught on			1
he revealed his two - year - old son @entity179 was watching the speech , and after 15 minutes he suddenly said ' @entity80 '			1
but he admitted he thought his wife was ' trying to make me feel good , but anyway '			0
mr @entity2 renewed his attack on government competence , citing today 's revelation that the @entity187 franchise process was flawed			2
he said : ' i had the list yesterday of the incompetence of this government , little did i know that the lost would be out of date in less than 24 hours			0
‘ what can you say about the @entity187 fiasco			0
‘ it is a disgrace that it is going to cost £ 40m of taxpayers money because they have so bungled this franchise			0
‘ the prime minister needs to get a grip on this useless incompetent government			0
‘ there is a pattern with this government			0
already we see them scurrying for cover			0
it is not their fault			0
‘ they always find somebody else to blame , this time it ’s the civil service			0
‘ it ’s @entity11 ’s @entity215			0
when it comes to who is to blame , it is " @entity219 "			0
that is the reality of this government			0
’ mr @entity2 's schooldays at a comprehensive school are being contrasted with @entity11 's time at @entity143 tonight a @entity13 party political broadcast will again emphasise mr @entity2 's upbringing and experience at @entity228 , a comprehensive in north @entity229			1
in the broadcast , mr @entity2 says : ' every young person should feel they can have a career , a future like i had , you should n’t be the lucky few			0
' i think the education that i got at this comprehensive was so much more than how to pass exams			0
' it was about how do you look after yourself , it was about the world is a complex place with people of all kinds and all nationalities , all classes , all races and you know , that is a really important lesson in life			0
' earlier , the @entity252 launched a poster campaign in @entity24 attacking mr @entity2			0
a van circulated the city with an advert depicting the @entity257 as a poodle on a lead held by a pin - striped banker , under the slogan : ' @entity13 : 13 years as the bankers ' lapdog			1
two years trying to hide it			0
' a @entity252 spokesman said : ' @entity2 's political education did n't take place at school in @entity269 but in the @entity270 under @entity271			2
' he and @entity272 were special advisers to @entity271 when they let the banks run amok and claimed to have abolished boom and bust			0
' but @entity13 was disimissive of the criticism			1
a @entity13 source said : ' this is ridiculous , desperate stuff from a party that voted to help @entity11 give a £ 40,000 tax cut to 8,000 millionaires			1

@entity13 leader says he wants *social* background to be considered when selecting @entity13 election candidates
in question and answer *session* , party members wave umbrellas , hard hats and cuddly toys to attract his attention
announces he will join union 's *anti-cuts* march
after @entity80 speech , he says even his son @entity179 , 2 , is using his new slogan
but lord @entity82 asks : ' who the hell is @entity91 ? '
