by @entity0 @entity2 businesswomen @entity3 , 41 , left , and @entity4 , 37 , admitted conspiracy to defraud at @entity6 they rubbed shoulders with the stars , chatted to the chancellor and even shook hands with the @entity11 at @entity12 – all the while being praised for helping people find work			1
but unknown to those they mingled with , businesswomen @entity16 and @entity4 had been busy masterminding a sophisticated scam which saw them steal £ 200,000 of taxpayers ’ money			1
the pair co-founded simply recruitment in 2008 – a company that claimed to ‘ help adult learners improve their job chances ’			1
this led to them being awarded the @entity31 award			0
they relied on their carefully constructed veneer of respectability as they hobnobbed with the likes of prince @entity37 and former dragons ’ den tycoon @entity38			0
their success led to them meeting the @entity11 at an @entity43 reception held at @entity12 , and at other prestigious events they mingled with @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
but it has now emerged that the pair ’s astonishing rise to success was built on a complex scam which involved taking money from the government - funded quango , @entity57			2
a court heard @entity16 , 41 and @entity4 , 37 , recruited an army of ‘ ghost students ’ to pose as clients in order to acquire large amounts of funding			1
investigators believe they claimed the money by charging @entity57 for fraudulent training courses , most of which took place between march and november 2010			1
the pair used company employees to fake student enrolment and exam result records in adult education packages			1
their staff were told to sit the exams and then doctor the results in order to secure funding from the government			0
employees were coerced into forging the signatures of fake students to add extra weight to the fraud			2
hundreds of real students are also thought to have been enrolled without their knowledge , and work was faked for students who signed up to courses but later pulled out			2
other results were doctored to make it appear that students who failed the tests had actually passed their exams			0

@entity3 and @entity4 entered their pleas last august , but they can only now be reported after the scam ’s ringleader , @entity116 , admitted the same charge in january			1
he swindled at least £ 120,000 from the charity @entity57 by creating ghost students , – but was caught when the @entity122 ’s fraud squad was alerted to concerns over an unusual number of high - level passes in february 2011			1
@entity116 , 43 , from @entity126 , @entity127 , was jailed for a year and has already had to repay £ 120,000			2
