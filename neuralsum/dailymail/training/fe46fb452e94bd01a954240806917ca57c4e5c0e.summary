' tactical ' : policies announced by @entity1 have been criticised as ill - thought - out and not up to the task of combating terrorism @entity1 ’s anti-terror plans came under fresh attack yesterday amid claims he proposed the crackdown to shift attention from the embarrassment of a @entity11 mp defecting to @entity12			1
in a major @entity14 statement on monday , he vowed to introduce measures to bar @entity17 fanatics fighting in @entity18 and @entity19 from re-entering the @entity17 , either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home			1
but critics suggested mr @entity1 had ratcheted up the rhetoric to try to ‘ bury bad news ’ after @entity11 backbencher @entity29 stunned @entity30 by defecting to @entity12 last week			1
@entity32 mp @entity31 , a member of the @entity33 , said : ‘ @entity1 used the most apocalyptic language to tell us that we faced a generational struggle against the threat of jihadists to @entity39			1
‘ i agree with him			2
tackling extremists and extremism to prevent @entity17 people becoming terrorists at home and abroad is a huge priority			2
‘ but the measures he announced were a damp squib			0
they did not amount to much more than tough talking			0
it looks very much like he was playing politics with security to deflect attention from the problems he is having within his own party			0
’ in a further blow to @entity60 , the independent reviewer of terror laws warned there would be ‘ significant difficulties ’ in stopping @entity17 - born suspects re-entering the country			1
it also emerged another proposal , to force terror suspects living in the @entity17 to be relocated away from other militants , might be blocked by deputy prime minister @entity69 , the @entity69 leader			2
the criticism increased the sense of disarray surrounding the ‘ targeted ’ package of proposals unveiled by mr @entity1			1
a senior @entity11 criticised @entity60 for briefing ill - thought out terror policies			1
he said : ‘ they do n’t think , “ let ’s get a serious set of policies that may solve the problem			0
” they think , “ let ’s brief something that will get rid of this problem for the next 72 hours			0
” it is tactical media management , nothing else			0
’ @entity88 , the counter-terrorism watchdog , said there were ‘ legal difficulties ’ with stopping @entity17 - born citizens who had been fighting abroad from returning to the @entity17 , as rendering them stateless would breach international law			2
do n't look at this : @entity1 's announcement have been derided as an attempt to deflect attention from the defection of @entity11 mp @entity99 ( pictured left with @entity100 ) to @entity12 the prime minister also wants to force airlines to hand over advanced passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing planes in the @entity17			1
mr @entity106 said : ‘ the whole concept of citizenship is about the right of abode ... if you ’re going to suspend that , even on a temporary basis , i think you run into some legal difficulties			0
‘ where does the person go ? do they go back to @entity19 for a bit more jihad ? do they go and find a beach somewhere in @entity121 ? ‘ the trouble with this game of pass the parcel , whether it comes to terrorists or other criminals , is that if other people ’s terrorists or criminals find their way to @entity39 , they too could say , “ well we wash our hands of these people , we ’re not going to let them back , they ’re your problem ” .			0
