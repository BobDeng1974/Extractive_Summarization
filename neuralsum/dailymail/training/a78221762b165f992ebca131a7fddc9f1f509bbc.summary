a total of 13 aircraft suddenly vanished off radars for about 25 minutes on two occasions while flying over @entity4 , it has been revealed			1
in what is being billed as ' unprecedented ' circumstances , the incidents on june 5 and yesterday saw the flight data disappear from air controller screens			1
@entity4 's flight safety organisation admitted that the height , location and other information for a total of 13 aircraft mysteriously vanished from radars			1
' unprecedented ' : the planes disappeared from radars over @entity4			1
pictured , air traffic controllers in @entity18 investigation : data for the planes disappeared as they were flying over @entity4 and other @entity23 countries air traffic control monitors airspace using two radar systems : primary and secondary - which is the main system used worldwide for controlling aircraft			1
the primary radar detects and measures the approximate position of aircraft using radio signals			0
the secondary radar , which relies on targets being equipped with a transponder , also requests additional information from the aircraft - such as its identity and altitude			0
all commercial aircraft are equipped with transponders , which automatically transmit a unique four - digit code when they receive a radio signal sent by radar			0
the code gives the plane 's identity and radar stations go on to establish speed and direction			0
this flight data is then relayed to air traffic controllers			1
however , once an aircraft is more than 240km ( 150 miles ) out to sea , radar coverage fades and high - frequency radio is used by air crew to keep in touch with those on the ground			2
@entity61 is only used by pilots to show their own position on a map , and these signals are not relayed to air traffic control			1
the ' @entity67 ' contains a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder			1
they emit ultrasonic waves , but have limited range , and do n't use @entity61			0
it is believed that some of the planes were long - haul flights carrying passengers on board			1
@entity79 , a spokesman for @entity80 , said relevant @entity82 agencies have been asked to investigate the ' unprecedented ' situation			0
he added that other unnamed neighbouring countries had similar incidents and the @entity82 's @entity86 , and @entity87 has been asked for a probe			1
@entity79 did not identify the other nations that the @entity23 flights were flying over when they disappeared from secondary surveillance radars			0
however , a report in the @entity102 newspaper said as well as in @entity103 in @entity4 , flight controllers in @entity93 and @entity94 in @entity95 , and in @entity96 , the @entity97 , and @entity98 in @entity99 also reported related problems			2
the report said @entity95 air traffic control had confirmed the black outs , adding that the reason there were no collisions was due to the air traffic controllers			1
it could have had dramatic consequences , as 4,000 planes take to the sky in @entity4 every day - with 50 in the air at any one time , according to the report			1
air traffic was conducted ' blind ' - by voice only - during the temporary outage , it claimed			1
the revelations echo the circumstances surrounding missing @entity122 from @entity123 to @entity124 which disappeared on march 8			0
the @entity125 777 - with 239 passengers and crew on board - vanished from civilian radar screens about an hour into the night flight			2
the search for the flight - which involves countries including the @entity134 , the @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 - has so far recovered nothing			2
in relation to the 13 missing flights about @entity23 , @entity102 cited unnamed experts as saying interference between the aircrafts ' transponders and ground control was apparently to blame			2
map of locations over @entity23 which have reportedly experienced flight data black outs @entity79 declined to confirm that or to say which airlines and planes were involved			1
but he suggested that at least some may have been long - distance passenger aircraft , based on their high altitudes			2
there was no danger at any time , he said			0
@entity79 said extra air controllers immediately were called to their posts and emergency measures , including establishing voice contact with the pilots and widening flight corridors , were put into effect			2
the @entity82 â€™s @entity86 and @entity87 will investigate the incidents			0
missing : the news echoes the surroundings of the @entity173 flight that disappeared in march			0
pictured , @entity173 aircraft parked on the tarmac at @entity176 @entity79 said that safety in the @entity4 air space was guaranteed at all times			2
he told @entity180 : ' there is no situation in aviation where there is not another procedure that takes place			0
' we noticed that some of the responder data sent from the plane to the ground disappeared for a short period of time from the radar screens			0
' that is the reason why the contingency procedures were put into place			0
' voice communication guaranteed that we knew everything about the planes in @entity4 air space and allowed air traffic controllers to do their jobs			1
' distance between aircraft was increased			0
' when asked what had caused the black out , @entity79 said no error was indicated on the operating system , but they would have to wait to hear the results of the investigation .			0
