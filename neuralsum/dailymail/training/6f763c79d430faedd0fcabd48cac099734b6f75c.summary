by @entity0 as the longest - serving heir to the throne in @entity5 history , prince @entity1 is well versed in representing his country in a ceremonial role			1
and yesterday , as he reached his landmark 65th birthday , he fulfilled his official duties in @entity10 with his usual style and bonhomie			2
as he walked along bustling @entity13 in the city of @entity15 , @entity16 , he stopped in his tracks when he heard an @entity19 voice serenading him with a tuneful version of @entity21 from a balcony			1
after a little scrabbling , and to the prince ’s cheers , the holidaymaker managed to grab the flower			0
‘ we could n’t believe we were coming half way round the world and here they are , ’ said mrs @entity26 , who sings with @entity39 back home in @entity41 , @entity42			1
‘ i feel so thrilled and flattered he threw me a rose			1
i just ca n’t believe it			0
’ as well as flowers , the prince was the recipient of no fewer than six birthday cakes yesterday – the last following a 75 - minute flight from @entity10 to @entity54			2
at the @entity31 in @entity55 he was presented with a large carrot cake decorated with the @entity1 feathers			1
a metropolitan police protection officer had to hastily move prince @entity1 away after his jacket almost caught alight on the 100 - year - old burner lit with 65 flaming wicks in honour of his birthday the royal couple were cheered by hundreds of wellwishers as they walked along the bustling @entity13 and some sang @entity21 to the prince prince @entity1 offered ' namaste ' - or greetings - to people on @entity13 as he walked past a poster of himself the cake was so moist the slice he cut off fell from his knife			1
undeterred , he offered a morsel to his wife , the @entity74 , and popped one into his own mouth in front of a cheering crowd of wellwishers			0
back in @entity16 , his staff had teased him with a cake in the shape of a free bus pass , which he can now claim as a pensioner			2
marked with @entity85 , it said : ‘ hrh prince @entity1			1
valid from 14 nov 2013			0
concessionary travel funded by @entity88 with your local authority			0
happy 65th birthday ! ’ everywhere he went he was the centre of attention – on walkabouts , pressing the flesh and allowing himself to be festooned with flowers in ancient @entity15			2
a birthday message for @entity1 that was put on a building wall on @entity13 the prince throws a flower into a giant cooking bowl big enough to feed 6,000 people @entity29 carried a parasol and a fan during as they arrived at the @entity105 in @entity15 for most people reaching the age of 65 , such a relaxing and carefree day would be a fitting way to start slipping into a comfortable retirement			1
but for the prince it marks the beginning of something more profound			0
with his mother the @entity114 now in her 88th year , he is likely to be asked to assume more and more of her duties as head of state			0
his mission now – with his chosen consort @entity29 at his side – is to prove himself a worthy king - in - waiting			0
his first task – opening the @entity123 conference in @entity54 today – is at best a challenge , at worst a diplomatic minefield			0
@entity126 , @entity10 , and @entity127 have boycotted the meeting in protest at @entity54 ’s alleged human rights abuses against its @entity132 minority and the atmosphere in @entity55 is crackling with tension			0
but keeping the @entity123 together through monumentally difficult times in the post-colonial era is one of his mother ’s proudest achievements			0
it is now up to @entity1 to show the same leadership and qualities of conciliation			2
the royal couple received a garland of flower each before being given a tour of the synagogue @entity149 was trying to keep herself cool during the string of engagements today a small boy is held up by his father as places a garland of flowers over prince @entity1 's head @entity157 has refused to comment on whether @entity1 plans to raise in private the human rights issue with @entity54 president @entity159 but @entity161 ’s @entity160 urged him to take action			1
‘ prince @entity1 is clearly in a difficult position representing the @entity114 who famously avoids politics in all contexts , ’ he said			2
‘ but i very much hope that in private prince @entity1 will make absolutely clear how dismayed anybody who cares about human rights would be , seeing what is happening in @entity54 today			2
‘ as the representative of the @entity114 he will no doubt choose his words carefully when speaking publicly , but i hope that even there we will see a reflection and understanding of how serious the problems are that @entity54 is facing , and one would hope that will not be swept under the carpet			0
’ @entity1 tastes into his 65th birthday cake which had been decorated with the @entity1 feathers after landing in @entity55 , @entity54 , prince @entity1 toasts the assembled crowd after having come carrot cake the prince started his birthday in the £ 500 a night presidential suite of the luxury @entity186 , situated on the banks of the @entity188 , a vast stretch of tranquil , emerald green backwaters			1
it was n’t quite the romantic getaway his wife might have hoped			0
thirty rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort			1
on waking up @entity1 was presented with cake number one featuring a portrait of himself and his wife			1
he cut a slice to enjoy on his plane later and arranged for the rest be sent to a local orphanage			0
the @entity1 ( centre ) is presented with a birthday cake topped by three elephants , by the president of @entity54 @entity159 ( left ) and his wife @entity208 ( right ) at the @entity210 in @entity55 , @entity54 after that , however , it was very much business as usual with a break - neck string of engagements – another example of what his wife affectionately described in yesterday ’s @entity218 as her exhausting , workaholic husband			1
at a souvenir shop @entity1 almost set himself alight on a 100 - year - old oil burner that had been lit with 65 wicks to honour his big day			2
one of his @entity224 protection officers lunged forwards to stop the prince ’s clothing catching alight but slipped on the shop ’s highly polished doorstep and stumbled against his boss – to comic effect			0
it was also to @entity1 ’s relief because of the intense heat from the wicks – and the @entity10 sun. the prince woke up to a view like no other to start his birthday at the £ 500 - a - night @entity241 at the luxury @entity186 in rural @entity16 prince @entity1 stayed in the £ 500 - a - night presidential suite , which is a by - word for royal seclusion the luxury stay was not quite the romantic getaway @entity29 might have hoped for as 30 rooms were booked by the royal party and close to 400 police officers took over the security of the resort a gun fires in front of @entity254 as members of the @entity256 fire a gun salute at the @entity258 to mark prince @entity1 birthday today			1

@entity1 threw rose to @entity5 tourist @entity26 when she started singing
was serenaded as he walked along bustling @entity13 during tour
@entity1 spent birthday *morning* at luxury @entity186
royal party booked 30 rooms at hotel which was guarded by 400 police
