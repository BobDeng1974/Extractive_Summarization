families of victims of the september 11th terrorist attacks are outraged over the proposed changes to @entity5 policies that will now allow small knives and large athletic equipment like lacrosse sticks of golf clubs on board commercial airplanes			1
' i 'm really horrified and i would say the majority of 911 family members are really shocked by it , ' said @entity16 , the mother of firefighter @entity17 who died trying to save people in the @entity19			2
ms @entity16 is just one of the relatives of 9/11 victims who can not believe that the @entity5 would allow so many more items past security now after they announced just yesterday that the changes will go into effect because of a review of @entity28 regulations			1
she is one of the many family members of victims who is outraged at the new @entity5 changes new rules : flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board remaining restrictions : @entity5 officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers the @entity5 said effective april 25 , it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide			1
ms @entity16 told @entity54 about a recent flight she took to @entity56 where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yoghurt onto a flight			1
' yoghurt 's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club ! ' she said			1
' i am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife			1
i do n't think there is another 9/11 family who does n't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear			2
' i always think of 9/11			2
i always think " is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist ? " ' another relative , @entity78 , says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned			2
ms @entity78 's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the @entity83 on september 11 , 2001			0
the hijackers wielded box cutters			0
the families of victims are not the only ones who are upset : the former colleagues of victims are as well			0
specific : the @entity5 says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures exemptions : only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all the @entity101 ' categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin , ' and they do n't understand why ' such a momentous decision ' was made without any consultation			1
as for some of the larger items that they will now allow , like the sports equipment , increases ' the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning			0
it 's a recipe for disaster , ' said the @entity118 representative			0
' this is part of an overall risk - based security approach , which allows transportation security officers to better focus their efforts on finding higher - threat items such as explosives , ' he said			0
travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs , ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes			1
other items that will be allowed on board again as part of a passenger 's carry - on luggage include billiard cues , ski poles , hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks			0
items that had been prohibited like razors , box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board			0
the restrictions about liquids are still in place as well , meaning that anything under 3 - ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint			0
loosening the reins : @entity5 officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on april 25 no longer a threat ? billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now the @entity161 , which represents nearly 90,000 flight attendants from carriers across the country , called the decision a ' poor and shortsighted decision ' by the @entity5			1
' as the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners , we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure , ' the coalition said in a statement			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity178 said the decision was made to bring @entity28 regulations more in line with @entity183 standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers			1
@entity178 said the @entity5 has implemented a number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors , allowing some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes			2
he said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew			0
