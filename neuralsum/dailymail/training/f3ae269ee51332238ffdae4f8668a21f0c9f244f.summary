by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 11:04 est , 7 march 2014 solar storms and distant stars are just some of the wonders seen by astronauts on the @entity6			2
but when living so far from home , it ’s the poignant marks of humanity revealed in space that really capture their attention			2
and from their 200 - mile - high perch on the space station , far more detail about life on @entity19 can be seen that you might expect			2
this image from the @entity6 shows the @entity22 including @entity23 and @entity24 at night			1
the lights from human settlements reveal where the major towns and activity are			0
the large mass of light in the middle is @entity33 , @entity23 's capital city			1
the @entity22 coastline is heavily populated with @entity36 and @entity37 along the @entity38 prominent at the bottom right of this photo			1
the white light in the top left of the photo is a reflection of the camera flash in this recent image from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , the @entity22 showing @entity23 and @entity24 can be clearly seen			1
the lights from human settlements reveal the major towns			0
the large mass of light in the middle is @entity33 , @entity23 ’s capital city			1
it shows how the @entity22 coastline is heavily populated with @entity36 and @entity37 along the @entity38 prominent at the bottom right of this photo			1
@entity24 , to the west , shows similar lighting with the coast from @entity57 to @entity58 a haze of light			1
@entity24 , to the west , shows similar lighting with the coast from @entity57 to @entity58 a haze of light			1
the green line shows @entity19 's atmosphere which protects the planet here , the capital city of @entity24 , @entity57 , is shown with south at the top of the image			1
the brightest area is the city centre			0
the two bridges connecting the capital to the south - @entity73 @entity74 and @entity73 - show up as two straight lines crossing the black @entity76			0
the peninsular city of @entity78 shows up as a blob of light protruding into the @entity81 at the bottom of the picture the city lights of @entity23 and @entity24 define the @entity22 in this photograph from the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
several large metropolitan areas are visible , marked by their relatively large and brightly lit areas , including the capital cities of @entity33 , @entity23 - located near the centre of the peninsula			2
the astronaut view is looking toward the east the @entity22 is in southwestern @entity92 and occupied by @entity23 and @entity24			1
its name derives from its ancient inhabitants whom the @entity95 called @entity96			0
the @entity81 hits the western and northern coasts , and the @entity38 the eastern			0
@entity98 , in @entity24 , is the most westerly point of continental @entity92			2
the @entity100 form an effective land barrier in the northeast from the rest of @entity92 , and in the south at @entity106 the peninsula is separated from @entity107 by a narrow strait			0
this astronaut - image reveals how close the @entity22 is to @entity110			2
a thin line of blackness – the @entity113 – separates the two			0
another thin line stands out in this picture			0
it shows @entity19 ’s atmosphere as a green shroud that surrounds and protects our planet			1
in another image from the @entity6 , the capital city of @entity24 is shown with its south end facing the top of the picture			1
the brightest area is the city centre			0
the two bridges connecting the capital to the south – @entity131 @entity74 and @entity73 – show up as two straight lines crossing the black @entity76			0
the peninsular city of @entity78 shows up as a haze of light protruding into the @entity81 at the bottom of the picture			2
this image was taken using @entity141 ’s @entity140 camera aid that compensates for the motion of the @entity6			1
the target stays firmly centred in frame so the final image is in focus			0
astronauts can set up the device to take ultra-sharp images automatically using off - the - shelf cameras from 400 km up			0
perhaps one of the most striking recent images from the @entity6 shows how @entity153 really are kept in the dark			1
@entity153 appears like a black hole in a sea of light in this remarkable @entity159 satellite image of the isolated communist state			1
the image , taken from the @entity6 earlier this year , shows @entity153 as a swathe of dark ground between @entity164 in the north and @entity166 the bright sun greets the @entity6 in this november 22 scene from the @entity170 section of the orbital outpost , photographed by one of the astronauts taken at night on january 30 from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) this picture shows @entity153 almost completely devoid of lights			1
in stark contrast to the south of the image @entity166 is shown bathed in light as is @entity164 to the north both clearly visible bustling with energy			2
@entity153 - which is ruled by supreme leader @entity183 - is almost completely black appearing to show a distinct lack of power or energy supply			0
the only exception is the country 's capital @entity190 to the south east of the nation which is illuminated by city lights			0
however the rest of the country - which has a population of 24 million - is pitch black looking almost like a sea between @entity166 and @entity164			0
other images of the planet by night have recently been released in ‘ gravity : @entity159 ’s real - life images from space ’ series uses photos taken over the last several years			2
the collection was put together to celebrate the success of the 2013 film ‘ gravity ’ which swept the board at the 86th @entity211 with seven @entity211			0
this unique photographic angle , featuring the @entity6 's @entity216 and crew activity inside it , other hardware belonging to the station , city lights on @entity19 and airglow was captured by one of the expedition 28 crew members			1
the major urban area on the coast is @entity223 , @entity224			0
the station was passing over an area southwest of @entity227			0

image shows @entity22 coastline heavily populated with @entity36 and @entity37 visible at bottom right of the photo
mass of light in the middle is @entity33 and @entity24 is shown to the west with lights on coastline from @entity57 to @entity58
taken from the @entity6 , the image shows @entity19 ’s atmosphere as a green shroud that surrounds and protects the planet
previous images of the @entity19 by night have revealed the *staggering* *extent* that @entity153 are kept in the dark
