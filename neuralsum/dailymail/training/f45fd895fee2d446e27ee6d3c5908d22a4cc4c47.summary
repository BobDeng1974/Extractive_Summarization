so it is perhaps unsurprising that a collagen drink introduced at @entity4 last month is already proving to be something of a beauty hit			1
the supplement has become the biggest - selling product on the @entity4 website after the chain became the first in the @entity6 to stock it			1
experts , however , have said it ‘ offers no advantage ’ over a normal diet			0
the anti-ageing drink , called @entity25 , comes in 50ml bottles containing a daily dose of collagen – a protein that gives skin strength and elasticity – along with acids designed to promote the protein ’s production			1
as it gets older , the body ’s reserves of collagen deplete , causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles			2
a @entity4 spokesman yesterday said that the drink was up to 50 times more effective than collagen creams and pills at replacing the skin ’s protein stores			1
he said : ‘ it not only replaces collagen but gets straight into the blood stream so the effects can last up to two months if you stop using it			0
’ in clinical trials of 1,500 women aged 35 to 55 who drank it daily , two - thirds reported an ‘ up to 30 per cent reduction ’ in lines and wrinkles			2
a number of celebrities also praised the drink , which costs £ 35.99 for a ten - day supply			1
@entity65 , 52 , said it was ‘ one of the most effective skincare products ’ she had tried			2
the former @entity70 presenter said : ‘ i ’m always a little sceptical of things like this but people have been saying “ you look well ” and to be honest i do			0
’ celebrities backing : former @entity70 presenter @entity65 said the supplement was ' effective ' presenter @entity78 , 50 , added that , after taking the drink for a few weeks , ‘ my skin looks and feels more youthful , radiant and hydrated ’			1
but some experts said the supplement was unlikely to be effective			0
cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity83 said : ‘ a collagen drink offers no advantage that i ’m aware of over normal dietary protein			0
‘ replenishing collagen stores is a complex and finely tuned biological process			0
you ca n’t cheat by importing these molecules “ whole ” from the diet			0
’ consultant dermatologist dr @entity93 added that the drinks were ‘ interesting ’ , but said : ‘ more research is needed before we can be sure if they result in facial rejuvenation			0
