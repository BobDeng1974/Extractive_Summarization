a new type of solar cloud has been discovered emanating from the sun. the magnetic cloud is a smaller version of larger clouds of particles known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections , which can produce auroras on @entity10			1
and the finding could apparently help us understand how such space weather affects our planet			1
dr @entity15 from the @entity16 has discovered a new solar cloud			1
solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space , often as coronal mass ejections ( @entity24 ) , shown			1
this latest finding is smaller than comparable @entity24			2
but she says it could help us understand how space weather affects @entity10 the discovery was made by dr @entity15 from the @entity16 together with @entity32 of the @entity33 in @entity34 , and @entity35 at the @entity36			1
she made the discovery while looking at matter expelled from the sun and thrown out into space			0
' our work has been studying how solar flares are generated and the effects they cause , ' explained dr @entity15 , reports the @entity46			2
' we already knew there were these large magnetic clouds generated by solar flares			0
' we also knew that smaller magnetised structures existed , but what we have found is that they have a completely different origin			0
the earth 's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years , researchers have found			0
the move , which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north , was thought to take thousands of years			0
however , a new study found it can happen far faster			0
the new study by a team of scientists from @entity63 , @entity34 , @entity64 and the @entity65 , demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly , in less than 100 years - roughly a human lifetime			0
the discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of @entity10 's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal , leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years			2
' these smaller clouds have different characteristics which mean they must be generated in a different place and / or in a different way			0
' they must be coming from the sun but we are not sure yet where in the sun 's atmosphere they are being born			0
' she explained to @entity85 the finding is comparable to hurricanes and regular storms on @entity10			2
in this instance coronal mass ejections are much larger clouds of particles , whereas these new ' flux ropes ' are much smaller			1
their size can be one tenth the @entity10 - sun distance , but they are thought to be much more numerous on the sun than larger coronal mass ejections			1
but she adds : ' we did n't just see one cloud , it was a population of smaller clouds			2
' solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds of up to 370 miles ( 600 kilometres ) per second			2
when they arrive at @entity10 they can cause geomagnetic storms and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the @entity113 solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds approaching that of light			1
when they arrive at @entity10 they can cause geomagnetic storms and auroras ( shown ) , and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the @entity113 numerous spacecraft are in orbit around the sun to observe these events , including @entity129 's twin stereo spacecraft			1
the two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms			1
however , the agency announced the other day that they had lost contact with @entity138 ( ' behind ' ) , putting the mission in jeopardy			0
' communications with the stereo behind spacecraft were interrupted on 1 october , immediately after a planned reset of the spacecraft performed as part of a test of solar conjunction operations , ' @entity129 said			2
' the cause of the anomaly is not yet known , though a sensor anomaly in the guidance and control system is suspected			0
attempts to recover the spacecraft are continuing			0
' the latest findings , though , will be useful for other spacecraft including the sun , such as a planned probe by @entity160 in 2017			0
the discovery comes as one of @entity129 's twin sun - observing stereo spacecraft failed ( illustration shown )			1

@entity16 's dr @entity15 discovered a new type of solar cloud
solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space
this latest finding is smaller than comparable coronal mass ejections
she tells @entity85 they are known as ' flux ropes ' owing to their shape
but they were found to be much more numerous than bigger solar *eruptions*
she says it could help us understand how space weather affects @entity10
@entity197 comes as one of @entity129 's sun - observing stereo spacecraft failed
