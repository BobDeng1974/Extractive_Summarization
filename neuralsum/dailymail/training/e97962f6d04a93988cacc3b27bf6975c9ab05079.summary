by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 06:47 est , 5 march 2014 detained : @entity2 , a key adviser to @entity3 and deputy director of the no 10 policy unit , resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago @entity6 was last night facing allegations of a cover - up over the child porn arrest of one of @entity3 ’s oldest friends			1
@entity2 , 62 , deputy director of the no 10 policy unit , resigned and was arrested almost three weeks ago			1
but @entity6 said nothing , only choosing to confirm his arrest and departure after being questioned on monday by the @entity16			1
not even senior ministers had been informed			0
officials yesterday confirmed mr @entity2 had also previously been the subject of a formal sexual harassment complaint understood to involve a high - flying woman civil servant			1
she moved out of no 10 to another department after the case had been examined by mr @entity3 ’s chief of staff @entity26			2
yesterday , @entity28 insisted it was extraordinary that a senior figure could resign in such circumstances without any public announcement			0
no 10 faced also awkward questions about why mr @entity2 was confronted with the child pornography allegations and allowed to quietly resign hours before the police were called in			1
incredibly , outside mr @entity3 ’s close circle , only home secretary @entity35 was informed of mr @entity2 ’s resignation			1
on a dramatic day in the affair : @entity6 was first made aware of a potential offence on february 12 , when the matter was apparently brought to mr @entity3 ’s attention			2
mr @entity2 – who has been closely involved in drawing up @entity43 policy on internet porn filters – resigned later that day and was reported to the @entity45			1
he was arrested at his home in @entity47 in the early hours of february 13			0
police were also invited into @entity6 to examine it systems and the office used by mr @entity2			1
@entity3 and @entity51 outside @entity52 last week : officials faced awkward questions about why mr @entity2 was confronted with the child porn allegations and allowed to quietly resign before police were called in the senior no 10 aide quizzed by police over child porn offences has also faced a serious sexual harassment allegation , it was confirmed last night			1
until now @entity6 has refused to comment			0
@entity2 was accused by a woman civil servant who worked on major matters of government policy			0
highest level : @entity3 's chief of staff @entity26 treated the case of mr @entity2 's alleged sexual harassment of female colleague ' very seriously ' the woman is understood to be younger than mr @entity2 and has worked across @entity71			1
however , in another example of the secrecy surrounding the @entity76 affair , officials have refused to say when the complaint was made and what the details of her allegations were			0
but , such was the sensitivity of the case , it was treated ‘ very seriously ’ by @entity3 ’s chief of staff @entity26			2
it is understood the woman has now transferred to another @entity71 department following consultation with mr @entity2			2
the allegation is not , however , thought to be related in any way to mr @entity2 ’s arrest			1
the woman ’s identity is known to this newspaper but is not being published to protect her privacy			0
officials yesterday flatly refused to discuss any of the details of the claim against mr @entity2 and whether he faced any formal censure			1
last night no 10 dismissed rumours that the complainant had been unhappy with the handling of the case			0
a spokesman insisted it had been ‘ appropriately resolved ’ with the ‘ consent and in consultation with the individual that raised the issue ’			0
‘ i can confirm that a complaint around alleged inappropriate behaviour was raised			0
‘ the matter was dealt with very seriously at senior levels in full accordance with the @entity118 ’s human resources policy , ’ the prime minister ’s spokesman said			2
asked why it had taken so long for no 10 to come clean about the resignation of such a senior aide , mr @entity3 said : ‘ first of all , i have to be careful what i say about this issue because there is a criminal investigation underway			2
from yesterday 's mail ' obviously when i heard these allegations i was profoundly shocked and i remain profoundly shocked			2
‘ in terms of the release of this information , i do not think it would be right to pre-emptively speak about a criminal investigation and that is why we did not do that			0
' as questions were asked and as questions will inevitably be asked , we have given very full and straightforward answers , which is absolutely the right way to handle this situation			0
‘ i ’ve been clear right along , when i was first told about this issue – pretty much as soon as it was discovered – that we must handle this in absolutely the correct way			0
' i am satisfied that this is what no 10 has done			0
he did play an important role at @entity6			0
’ ' i have to be careful what i say ' : @entity3 , left , said he was ' profoundly shocked ' by the allegations			1
but @entity28 mp @entity154 , right , said the pm can not just bury his head in the sand and hope the issue goes away a senior @entity28 source said mr @entity2 ’s departure was ‘ clearly in the public interest ’ and questions were being asked about ‘ whether @entity6 sat on this information in order to exploit what was happening with @entity165 ’			1
miss @entity165 has faced controversy in recent weeks over links between a civil liberties organisation she used to work for and a paedophile group			0
a @entity28 source said questions had been asked about whether @entity52 ' sat on ' information to exploit the outcry over @entity165 's links to @entity176 @entity154 , a senior @entity28 mp who is calling for a public inquiry into child abuse allegations , said : ‘ i fully understand no 10 has a duty of care to a former staff member who has n’t yet been charged			1
people expect answers to their legitimate questions though			0
' did mr @entity2 go through developed vetting [ for security clearance ] ? why did he appear to have advance notice of police involvement ? mr @entity3 can not put his head in the sand and hope this goes away			1
’ mr @entity2 has yet to comment on the allegations against him , and has not been charged with any offence			1
a @entity6 source said : ‘ any decision to proactively announce the arrest is clearly a matter for the @entity45			2
' it would have been completely inappropriate for us to have ignored the police and made such an announcement , not least because it might have jeopardised the investigation			0
’ mr @entity3 and mr @entity2 worked together as special advisers to @entity204 in his time as home secretary in the mid- 1990s			1
mr @entity2 later worked for @entity207 during his time as a @entity210 commissioner in @entity211			2
the prime minister brought him back into government in 2011			0
in the policy unit , mr @entity2 helped broker a deal with internet firms which means millions of households are being asked if they want family friendly filters to screen out porn from their computers .			2

@entity2 resigned and was arrested nearly three weeks ago
but @entity52 only confirmed it after being questioned by the @entity16 on monday
it also emerged that he was accused of sexual harassment by a colleague
officials face quiz as to why @entity2 was allowed to resign before his arrest
and there are questions over silence as @entity239 faced *pressure* over @entity176
@entity3 said he had been ‘ profoundly shocked ’ by the charges against mr @entity2 , who he has been close to for decades ;
mr @entity2 was said to have been ‘ top of the list ’ in the next tranche of *conservative* *nominations* for the @entity248 ;
it emerged he had been at an *election* *manifesto* meeting with @entity35 and @entity254 very shortly before his arrest ;
senior officials at the *shadowy* @entity45 – @entity259 ’s answer to the @entity260 – still refused even to confirm or deny the arrest as a *row* raged about why it had been kept under *wraps* .
