exactly where the mutual animosity comes from is a mystery but the friction between @entity4 and @entity5 was clear for all to see at the @entity7 awards for the best footballer in the world			1
the body language of both players and their partners as they sat waiting for the result spoke volumes			2
scratch a little deeper and it ’s clear from both players ’ vote in the competition that they could not bring themselves to recognise the other ’s remarkable talents			0
for the record , @entity4 , who tearfully accepted the top award , voted for @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity5 plumped for @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			2
friendship , @entity33 football politics and sheer childishness came before a genuine appraisal of genius			0
thumbs up : @entity4 salutes adoring fans in his first appearance since being crowned the world 's best signing it off : @entity4 pens autographs for fans ahead of @entity43 's clash with @entity44 frosty : ronaldo and girlfriend @entity46 ( left ) ignoring @entity5 and @entity48 emotional : a tearful @entity4 collects the @entity7 trophy from @entity50 with his son @entity4 lack of respect ? in the interview before the ceremony the pair barely acknowledged each other and the world ’s two finest players were not alone			1
one only had to look at @entity59 ’s website to appreciate the degree of tactical voting that goes on in football ’s answer to the @entity64			0
@entity4 even brought a bit of @entity64 to his acceptance speech , shedding @entity68 - style tears			2
yes , we ended up with the right result , but closer analysis of how the votes were cast made the whole thing a bit of a farce and something of an embarrassment to @entity59			0
the @entity7 is supposed to be a night when rivalries are put to one side to celebrate football at its finest			2
in concept it is similar to @entity64 , which was designed to help heal the scars of war - torn @entity84 in an attempt to celebrate a multi-cultural continent			0
in @entity88 on monday night , @entity4 and @entity5 did at least say the right things			1
@entity4 was deserving of his award , remarked @entity5 , and from the @entity43 superstar came similar words of respect			1
but the body language was dreadful , with @entity4 ’s girlfriend @entity46 turning her back on @entity5 ’s partner @entity48 as the couples sat side by side			1
@entity99 bias : @entity5 voted for @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity28 ( not pictured ) for his top three both @entity25 and @entity27 were among @entity4 's choices for the world 's best player body language was dreadful			1
it was plain rude the two men really should get on better , given how much they have in common			0
both are from impoverished backgrounds — @entity5 ’s father was a steel worker in @entity109 , @entity4 ’s a gardener in @entity110 — and they have risen to the top not only because of their tremendous talent but because of an incredible work ethic			1
but they have embraced their success in a different manner			0
@entity5 seems more down to earth , often arriving at training in a tracksuit , while @entity4 often looks as though he has just walked off a @entity121 catwalk			1
that said , @entity5 seemed to be over-compensating at the @entity7 when he opted for a daring , deep red dinner suit in contrast to @entity4 ’s more traditional black tuxedo			1
loyal : @entity129 captain @entity128 ( left ) even voted for his @entity131 team - mate @entity130 ( second right ) that difference in style fuelled the footballing equivalent of a diplomatic incident last october , when @entity136 told an @entity138 audience that he preferred @entity5 , praising his modesty			2
@entity136 went on to imply that @entity4 was far too interested in hair products			2
the rift between @entity4 and @entity5 certainly goes beyond their respective roles as ambassadors for adidas and @entity146			1
when major commercial opportunities have been presented to the two of them , one has been known to reject such offers upon discovering that the other is involved			0
perhaps the issue stems from an exchange that allegedly took place at the 2009 ceremony			0
@entity5 won the award for the first time and @entity4 , having emerged triumphant the previous year , whispered to @entity5 to enjoy his moment because the award would soon be coming back to him			1
it must , therefore , have wounded him to see the diminutive @entity109 beat him to the prize for the following three years			0
needs fixing : there was @entity33 bias in the team of the year with seven players based there retrieved : @entity4 won the award back in 2008 but on the last four occasions he had to watch @entity5 take it some argue that what animosity does exist is generated not by the players but by those around them			1
in an attempt to establish his client as the undisputed no 1 , @entity4 ’s agent @entity175 even played a part in creating a rival awards ceremony — the @entity181 — in 2010			2
but the childish voting by both players is , let ’s be honest , the clearest indication that a problem exists between the two			0
@entity4 and @entity5 were given a vote because they are captains of their national teams — leaders of men and , you would think , above such infantile behaviour			1
with a clear @entity43 bias , @entity194 went for @entity4 but ignored @entity5			1
@entity196 ’s @entity128 went for his @entity131 colleague @entity130 ahead of both of them			0
@entity200 also went for @entity130 , as a fellow @entity201 , and @entity202 chose another @entity203 in @entity204			0
patriotism : @entity202 voted for his @entity203 countryman @entity204 some of the national coaches were no better			0
@entity109 ’s man went for @entity5 , @entity211 ’s went for @entity4 and , lo and behold , the @entity209 manager went for @entity130			1
and how did @entity213 ’s players score ? well , in the best @entity64 tradition , nul points			0
on tuesday , @entity216 lavished praise on both @entity4 and @entity5			1
‘ i ’m still truly astonished by the drive and determination to stay at the top by not only @entity4 but @entity5 too , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s been a joy to witness these two push each other week in , week out			0
' the question i ask however is : would they be as relentless in scoring so many goals without each other , breaking every record along the way ? ’ all smiles : @entity232 , winner of the goal of the season , posing alongside model @entity235 @entity216 may have a point			0
they need each other and the animosity obviously plays its part in that competitive ‘ anything - you - can - do ’ tussle between two of the greatest players to have graced a football pitch			2
football may well be the winner			0
@entity4 and @entity5 have both brought joy and excitement to all of us			1
but it might not be the worst idea for @entity59 to change the voting process to avoid further embarrassment			0
‘ @entity258 , ’ declared @entity216			0

@entity4 and @entity5 appeared to ignore each other at the @entity7
even their girlfriends were pictured with their backs to one another
@entity5 only voted for @entity99 players while @entity4 did *n't* choose him
one theory is they need a hint of animosity to keep them motivated
