@entity7 eventually decided to battle the bulge after she went into @entity40 for cellutitis and overheard a nurse tell a colleague : ' if i ever get that fat , shoot me '			1

' then another time on holiday as he played on the beach i wept when i thought i would always have to watch from the back of the car because it was so hard to get out			0
' i would n’t go outdoors because of the cruel abuse			0
the worst came from kids but some was from those who should know better			0

' @entity7 eventually decided to battle the bulge after she went into @entity40 for cellutitis and overheard a nurse tell a colleague : ' if i ever get that fat , shoot me ' incredibly , the change was so astonishing that her sister - in - law @entity96 did n’t even recognise @entity7			1
the 49 - year - old , who works at a local newsagents , said : ' i did n’t even know she was having it so i failed to recognise who i was serving			0
' then i noticed her eyes and we hugged and both wept to know her ordeal was over			0
' daughter - in - law @entity105 , 28 , added : ' before the op she was very self - conscious			0
' she did n’t want to go out because sometimes people would stare and make comments			2

' in fact , since 2012 obesity has replaced smoking as the biggest cause of death			0
