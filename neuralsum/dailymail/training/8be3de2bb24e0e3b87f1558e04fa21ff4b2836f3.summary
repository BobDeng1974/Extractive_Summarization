by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 23 november 2012 @entity1 claimed to have gone straight back to her day job as a politician yesterday – while holed up in a luxury hotel in @entity5			1
but her bewildered constituency association said the mp , who has been suspended by the @entity8 after abandoning her post to appear on i ’m a celebrity ... @entity11 ! , has still not been in contact			1
miss @entity1 insisted she had started work within hours of being the first contestant evicted from the @entity5 jungle , as seen by viewers of the @entity17 reality show on wednesday night			1
the @entity38 mp , who has been paid up to £ 40,000 to appear on the show , said : ‘ there ’s been an office set up in my hotel room and i ’ve already been back at work actually			1
' as soon as i got out of the jungle i was straight back to work			2
’ but @entity46 , deputy chairman of the @entity47 , last night said he has still to hear from his mp , adding : ‘ she has not been in contact with me or anyone else in the association			2
‘ as i understand it she has set up an office in her hotel and says she has gone straight back to work but we have not heard from her			1
’ the association was furious when @entity60 , 55 , left for @entity5 without telling them and is considering deselecting her for the next general election			2
there have been more than 100 complaints from constituents about her absence			0
mr @entity46 added : ‘ i ’m looking forward to having her back in the constituency ; we would like to discuss with her the whole matter of what has gone on since she went away			2
' obviously what she has done has raised a few questions but we will just have to wait and see what she says before deciding on what action to take			0
’ eviction : the mp survived 12 days in the jungle as a contestant on i 'm a celebrity miss @entity1 was greeted by her partner , vet @entity85 , after surviving 12 days on the show and tackling some of its infamous @entity87 , which included eating an ostrich anus to win meals for her campmates			1
one of her first moves was to attack former chief whip @entity94 , who she claimed had given her permission to be away from @entity96 for a month			1
she said : ‘ a lot of mps can take between four and six weeks a year and he said that was fine and that i could take the month away			0
' i did n’t tell him what it was for , because i could n’t , as i was bound to confidentiality			0
' but i did tell him what i was going to do would be quite controversial			0
’ miss @entity1 said her office had been manned and her staff had been working for her constituents while she was away			1
' however well - intentioned , @entity1 's publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for ' conservative peer @entity112 she has also pledged to give her mp ’s salary for the time she is in @entity5 to local charities , although she has made no such comment regarding her much larger fee from i ’m a celebrity			1
a poll in her constituency revealed almost 60 per cent of conservatives ‘ disapprove ’ of her decision to abandon @entity125			2
asked to rate how they feel about @entity60 , ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘ extremely negative ’ , she scored just 2.82 , while 58 per cent said @entity127 was right to suspend her			0
just 8 per cent said they are now more likely to vote for her			2
conservative peer @entity112 , who commissioned the survey , said : ‘ @entity1 said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions , at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians			1
unfortunately , her constituents are not buying this			0
‘ there is a long way to go to the next election and voters can be forgiving			2
but however well - intentioned , @entity1 ’s publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for			1
’ @entity146 mp @entity145 mocked miss @entity1 ’s claim to be working , saying : ‘ i ’m sure her constituents will be greatly relieved to hear that she is going to do part of her job from her five - star hotel			1
’ he went on : ‘ if she was swallowed by a python and never came back to @entity96 i would n't lose too much sleep over it , ’ the @entity152 reported			0
‘ if she wanted to connect with people she should have talked to people face - to - face			0
i do n't have to go to @entity5 to do that			0
’ out of the jungle : @entity1 is the first one to be evicted from this year 's show but says she is already back at work in her @entity5 hotel room big hugs : the evicted mp was greeted by partner @entity85 and then there were two : @entity167 and @entity1 waited to find out which one was staying in the jungle hugging it out : @entity1 is comforted by her campmates following her eviction walk of shame : @entity1 crosses the bridge to be interviewed by @entity175 lazing about : @entity1 was spotted relaxing in the jungle , but has now been voted out bugged out : she was subjected to @entity178 trials , including being buried in a coffin with bugs speaking to i 'm a celeb hosts @entity175 announced the outcome of the vote at the campsite			1

i kind of expected it			0
' it 's been a fascinating experience			0
i actually came here self - important for a few days , but i 'm not now			0
' speaking about @entity190 , who she praised as ' very intelligent ' , @entity1 has revealed she gave her a motivational talk prior to her bushtucker victory , and seemed to take credit for @entity190 's trial triumph			1
