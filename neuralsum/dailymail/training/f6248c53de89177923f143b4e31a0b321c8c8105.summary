detectives believe they have finally unravelled the identity of ' the man who fell to @entity3 ' onto a suburban street near @entity5 , thanks to a @entity8 woman in @entity9			1
it was three months ago the man , an @entity12 in his 20s or 30s , plummeted 2,500ft to his death from the undercarriage of what is believed to have been a @entity18 plane landing from @entity19 , @entity20			1
he hit the ground in @entity22 , @entity23 , a wealthy street beneath the flightpath , with only some rudimentary possessions , small change and , crucially , a mobile sim card in his pockets			0
stowaway from @entity29 ( right ) worked for @entity30 in @entity31 ( 1 ) before heading home ( 2 )			0
he was found with money in pockets from @entity35 ( 3 ) and also headed through @entity36 ( 4 ) before catching a plane in @entity20 ( 5 ) and falling near @entity23 @entity38 : the stowaway 's body landed in a suburban street near @entity5 his identity had been a mystery but after a pain - staking trawl for information that led them to the woman in @entity9 , police now believe they know who he is , according to @entity52			1
key : police made breakthrough after tracing a woman who used to employ the man as a housekeeper			2
she recognised this tattoo which says @entity60 , the initials of his nickname they are not yet releasing his name publicly but say the victim - referred to as the man who fell to @entity3 in a poem left at the spot where he died - was from @entity29			1
the breakthrough came when they trailed information found on the @entity74 , which opened them up to a world of information about his life			0
among the several @entity35 and @entity36 numbers on his @entity20 - registered phone was that of the @entity8 - @entity9 woman , who had sent him a message saying : ' i need a favour			1
' after several failed attempts at contacting her , the intrigued woman responded to detectives ' messages and told them their description matched that of the man she had employed as a housekeeper in @entity31 in 2010			1
unprompted , she then described a tattoo on his arm bearing the initials @entity60 , which was his nickname			0
after 2010 it is thought the man had travelled across @entity31 , through @entity35 and @entity36 in search of work , before crossing the border into @entity20 and making the decision that would ultimately cause his death - to move to @entity108			2
when detectives arrived at the scene on september 9 , they initially thought they were dealing with a violent crime			0
but the man 's injuries and a witness 's report of a thump at 7.42am changed the course of the investigation			0
it was at precisely that time that @entity18 flight 76 from @entity19 had passed overhead			1
it is thought the man managed to clamber aboard the aircraft by evading security at @entity126 under the cover of darkness , and then escaping the attention of pilots during pre-flight checks			0
@entity18 maintain there is ' no direct evidence ' he was on their flight but police are certain this was the case			0
it is almost certain the man would have been dead by the time he fell to earth - temperatures would have fallen to as low as -60c during the 4,000 - mile flight .			2
