@entity1 's shocking demise has become even more stark as @entity2 can reveal that a whopping six of the side to beat @entity5 8 - 2 three years ago starting in the troubling draw away at @entity7 last week			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all lined up at the @entity14 on sunday ahead of another afternoon to lay bare the problems facing the club after sir @entity18 's departure			1
the @entity19 has been heavily criticised for the way in which he spent money towards the end of his tenure - jones , @entity9 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity10 have all been pinned up as poster boys for a flailing transfer policy			1
that , with the power of hindsight , has n’t exactly materialised - all too apparent on @entity54 and during the opening day defeat by @entity56 before it			0
since the @entity19 ’s retirement in 2013 , @entity1 ’s fortunes have taken a complete nosedive			1
@entity60 came and went in less than 12 months while @entity28 is struggling to get to grips with a largely incompetent squad			0
it was a scandalous seventh - place finish under @entity60 last season , with no @entity66 football , that led to the overwhelming need for change and the feeling that this is a club in need of a mammoth overhaul			0
@entity60 knew it ; @entity74 is all too aware			0
@entity24 is ready to be shipped out of @entity37 should a suitor be willing to pay his wages , while @entity25 is at @entity77 and question marks still loom large over @entity10			1
but do not forget that this pair also played in the thumping win against @entity5			2
@entity81 played up front in each			2
@entity83 was a substitute , too			0
then and now : @entity8 played against @entity5 in 2011 ( left ) and away at @entity7 this season ( right ) trouble : @entity60 was n't afforded the opportunity to sign big names during his time at the club and then the problems began : sir @entity18 's retirement rocked @entity1 to their core and those six starters were all on @entity74 's teamsheet as they stumbled to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity7 last weekend			1
that shines a rather bright light on the remarkable change in fortunes around @entity98 and poses questions as to what has actually happened			0
the players @entity18 spent huge sums on – and those youngsters he placed faith in from their teens – were the ones to demolish @entity109 ’s side 36 months ago			0
@entity12 netted a hat - trick , @entity10 got two , @entity81 opened the scoring and even @entity25 notched			1
that was a team at the peak of its powers			2
admittedly this was a dismal @entity117 outfit – their lowest point during @entity109 ’s reign – but @entity18 ’s young guns still finished them off			0
@entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 could only stand and watch			0
like our dedicated @entity1 facebook page			1
whipped : @entity10 scored a stunning goal against @entity5 to put the champions two ahead a happier time : @entity10 's stock has fallen dramatically over the course of the last three seasons the old saying is that players do not become bad ones overnight			1
@entity11 is being chased by @entity136 , who know a good ball player when they see one , while @entity25 has been deemed good enough for the @entity139 this term			1
fatal for @entity1 is that they stood still , perhaps even became complacent , with @entity18 in charge – trophies were still being won , there appeared no end to their dominance – and they ’ve been unable to deal with clear deficiencies since			1
@entity11 and @entity24 had both gone backwards , through injury and loss of confidence , but @entity60 suffered at the hands of @entity153 's incompetence in going out and failing to sign a quality central midfielder			2
they wanted @entity156 and failed , ending up with the overpriced @entity157 who – putting it mildly - has flattered to deceive			0
they have moved to sign players in areas that did n’t warrant it – see the £ 60million @entity163 as a frame of reference just this week – and were left with a crèche of a back three against @entity7			2
@entity167 and @entity168 's absence is become ever more glaring as the weeks float by			0
it really is hard to believe that most of the same players to shrink on @entity54 beat everything put in front of them three years ago ; @entity18 's spending was n't to blame , it 's what was done with them after that was the main problem			0
video i will help @entity1 return to the top - @entity182			2

@entity13 , @entity8 and @entity9 all played against the @entity184
@entity12 , @entity10 and @entity11 were all involved as well
@entity1 *limped* to a point against @entity7 with more than half of the same team from 2011 last weekend
