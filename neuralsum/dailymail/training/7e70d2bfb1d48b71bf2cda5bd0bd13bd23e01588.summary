by @entity0 many drivers think they will escape prosecution for texting at the wheel because they see so many others ‘ getting away with it ’ , an @entity2 report reveals today			2
some 51 per cent of motorists believe it is unlikely that they will ever be penalised for sending texts while their car is stopped in traffic			0
forty - two per cent think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move , with 16 per cent believing it is ‘ extremely unlikely ’ they will be challenged			1
unlikely : nearly half of drivers think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move and a shocking six out of ten of motorists are ignorant of the fact that texting at the wheel of a stationary car with the engine on is against the law despite the fact it has been illegal since 2003 for drivers to use a hand - held mobile phone			1
more than half of motorists report regularly seeing other people texting in stationary traffic during half or some of their journeys , while nearly a third claim to see this during most journeys			0
when it comes to drivers owning up to texting in stationary vehicles on the road , only one in 14 of motorists say they do , though this figure almost doubles to 15per cent for 17 to 24 - year - olds			1
one in six admit to not knowing texting and driving is illegal and one in five say do not know it is illegal to check @entity53 and @entity54 while driving			1
more than a quarter think it safe to text and look at social media sites when stationary with the engine running , despite this being illegal			1
this is also despite research that shows texting at the wheel is more distracting than driving when drunk			1
using a hand - held phone to text or speak at the wheel carries a £ 100 fixed penalty – recently increased from £ 60 - plus three points on the licence			2
ministers have pledged to review this and impose a higher penalty if widespread abuse continues			0
phone fans : six out of ten of motorists are ignorant of the fact that texting at the wheel of a stationary car with the engine on is against the law more broadly , 75per cent of motorists report regularly seeing other people talking on mobile phones with nearly half saying they see this happening during most of their car journeys			1
yet only 1 in 12 of drivers admit themselves to using a hand - held phone on most journeys			0
more than a third of motorists are concerned about other drivers talking on hand - held mobile phones and more than one in five about other motorists breaking traffic laws generally			0
but law - abiding motorists are deeply frustrated that law - breakers are being left to ‘ get away with it ’ because there are too few police on the road , according to the @entity2 report on @entity104 for 2014			0
by contrast they note how police and other authorities are happy to clamp down on speeding – because most of the work is done for them with automated cameras and requires little or no effort from actual officers			0
no likes : one in five drivers do not know it is illegal to check @entity53 while driving the @entity2 mooring report concludes : ‘ many motorists in 21st century @entity116 think there is little risk of being caught breaking the law at the wheel for anything other than speeding or running a red light : offences typically enforced via cameras			1
’ it says four out of ten motorists believe anyone committing common offences such as texting at the wheel of either a moving or stationary vehicle , aggressive driving , tailgating , middle lane hogging on the motorway or undertaking would more than likely ‘ get away with it ’			2
as a result 60per cent of motorists surveyed believe there are insufficient numbers of police officers on the roads to enforce driving laws			2
the @entity149 notes : ‘ while the vast majority of motorists are law - abiding , with only three million of more than 35.8m drivers having points on their licences , there seems to be a perception among many motorists – rightly or wrongly – that drivers wo n’t be caught if they flout the law			2
’ it notes : ‘ this is especially the case with the use of mobile phones while driving			0
’ for the new offences of tailgating and middle lane hogging only a quarter and one in five respectively think motorists are likely to be pulled up by a traffic police officer			0
for aggressive driving some 40per cent of motorists felt drivers would be unlikely to be caught , with 30per cent believing it likely			1
for so - called ‘ undertaking ’ passing a car on the inside - the figures were 49per cent unlikely and only 20per - cent likely			1
the report says : ‘ the only offences that motorists truly believe are dealt with effectively are the ones that are enforced via cameras such as speeding and traffic light violations			0
’ here nearly half think drivers will get caught for speeding and 46per cent for running a red light			1
of motorists with speeding points on their licences half say they were trapped by a speed camera , whereas only a quarter were caught by a police officer			2
@entity2 technical director @entity187 said : ‘ our research shows that millions of law - abiding motorists are frustrated with the reduction of traffic police and believe that the chances of drivers being pulled up for breaking the law are now minimal			0
‘ motorists are tired of constantly seeing other drivers breaking the law and getting away with it so it is hardly surprising that they want to see a greater police presence on our roads to enforce motoring legislation more effectively , which would also act as a genuine deterrent			0

forty - two per cent think it *'s* unlikely they *'ll* be caught texting and driving
one in five do *n't* know it is illegal to check @entity53 while driving
more than a quarter think it safe to text with engine running
