a mum who was persuaded to try for ' one last child ' by her husband was stunned when she beat odds of two million to one - to have naturally conceived identical triplets			1
@entity5 , 33 , thought her family was complete with daughter @entity7 , 13 , when her partner @entity8 , 27 , talked her into trying for another child			1
a scan at five weeks confirmed one little ' sack ' but she was astonished when medics later revealed she was expecting three identical triplet girls			1
@entity5 , a sales manager from @entity26 , @entity27 , said her living room ' resembles @entity29 ' with the couple bulk buying in almost 100 litres of baby formula a month for the growing babies			1
she has even arranged special rubbish collections to deal with more than 250 dirty nappies a week , as well as ordering a special £ 2,000 bumper pram for three			1
the @entity36 have also had to sell their @entity38 car - trading it in for a £ 5,000 second - hand @entity40			2
@entity5 also estimates her electricity bills have doubled since the twins have been born			1
but the proud mum insists the mountains of dirty babygrows and endless feeds are all worth it for the adorable trio , who are happiest snuggled up together holding hands			2
@entity5 fell pregnant with the triplets , pictured above , after being persuaded by her husband @entity8 to try for a second child			1
she said she ' thought it was a joke ' when told she was expecting three babies @entity5 's 12 - week scan revealed she was expecting triplets - after the previous scan had showed one ' sack ' the proud mum - of - four said : ' before the scan i had been saying something felt really different this time round			1
' i said a few times " i 'm sure there 's more than one " but i never said anything about triplets			0
' i just burst out laughing and asked " where are the cameras ? " i thought it must have been a joke , a set up			0
' when they were finally born it was so nice to finally see them - i did n't know who to go to first , who to touch or who to talk to first			2
' now we 've got them home everyone keeps offering to come round to help me because i have three , but they are great - they all slept through the night last night			0
' if i split them up though they do start to cry - the closer together they are the better			0
' the couple started trying for a baby early last year and found out on @entity88 that @entity5 was expecting			1
@entity5 said : ' i really disliked being pregnant the first time so i thought that was that , but a couple of years ago my husband said he wanted to have another baby			1
' he managed to talk me into it and i had my implant removed and we were pregnant after about four months			0
' mother - of - four @entity5 has had to buy extra equipment for the triplets - including a three - way pram bulk - buys 100 litres of baby formula a month had to arrange a special rubbish collection for the 250 dirty nappies does up to 20 washing machine loads a week electricity bills have doubled the special £ 2,000 three - baby pram had to be imported from @entity107 they all currently sleep in one cot - bed together , but they have bought two more £ 50 second - hand beds for when they grow too big to share , along with three £ 80 mattresses the family used to have a @entity38 car , but traded it in for a £ 5,000 second hand @entity40 van - with extra seats added mother 's instinct told @entity5 she might be carrying more than one baby , but a private scan at five weeks reassured her , after it appeared to show a single embryo			1
but when they went for the 12 - week scan at @entity126 , medics - who thought the couple must have had @entity130 - told the shocked pair they were expecting three			1
@entity5 said : ' i kept having a recurring dream where the sonographer said to me " have you had @entity130 ? have you got a history of twins in your family ? " ' so when we went for the 12 - week scan and he said we were having triplets i thought it was a joke			1
' doctors warned the family of the dangers of multiple births and for the whole pregnancy they said the smallest baby - named @entity20 - was unlikely to survive			1
' it was stressful , ' recalled @entity5			2
' we 'd have to go for scans every two weeks , and they would constantly warn us of the death and mortality rates for triplets			0
happy @entity155 ! the triplets pictured dressed as @entity157 were all home in time for the festive season ' they said @entity20 was n't going to make it to birth			2
every day onwards from then i was almost waiting for her to die			0
' i was depressed for about a week and then i realised that while i was doing that she was just kicking harder and harder			0
i could tell where each one was			0
' i thought , you know what , if she 's not going to give up , then i was n't either			0
the adorable trio were born at 32 weeks and four days on august 25 , via caesarean section at @entity126			0
@entity18 arrived first at 2.37am weighing 3lbs and 3oz , @entity19 was a minute later weighing 3lbs and 1oz and @entity20 arrived last at 2.39am weighing just 2lbs and 13oz			1
after five weeks , everyone except @entity20 was allowed to go home , and she joined them on october 16 - her due date - after an operation to remove fluid around her brain			1
' i 'd looked up pictures of premature babies before so i expected them to look a bit weird , but they were n't they were perfectly formed tiny little babies , ' @entity5 said			2
my babies took up the whole room			0
' it was so reassuring to see how perfect they were and they did n't need any help or anything with breathing - just a little tube for food			0
' now aged 20 weeks , the siblings have already formed a close bond			0
' they are such content and happy little babies , ' @entity5 said			2
' they love to cuddle			0
they put their arms around each other and love to hold hands			0
their favourite way to be is with @entity19 in the middle , and she holds both hands			2
' my living room does look like @entity29 and the washing machine is constantly on			1
' when i 'm feeding and burping them it is a lot of balancing , and juggling and holding bottles , but of course it is worth it			0
' i ca n't really remember life when my family was half the size			0
