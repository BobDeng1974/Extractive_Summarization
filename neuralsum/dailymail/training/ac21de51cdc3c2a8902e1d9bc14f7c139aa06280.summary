criticism : judge @entity21 ( left ) slammed @entity14 for failing to prevent @entity16 ( right ) repeatedly abusing a 14 - year - old girl the crimes happened after the force launched @entity25 in may 2011 , which targeted men sexually abusing vulnerable young girls in council care and saw seven men jailed for a total of 95 years after an 18 - week trial at the @entity33 last year			1
at @entity34 , judge @entity21 told how @entity16 , who was jailed for 14 years , subjected a vulnerable teenage girl to repeated abuse and forced her to have sex with his friends			1
