@entity7 goalkeeper @entity0 has revealed he 's been working with a psychologist @entity0 spoke to @entity15 about his meetings @entity0 told @entity17 : ' i 've got a relationship with someone who i 've worked with for a while			1
it 's a lot of fun			1
i like what i get out of it			0
just generally – it 's not necessarily just football and trying to ' unlock doors '			1
' it 's just general – kind of free - flowing , feeling comfortable and safe to talk			1
everyone could benefit from it , really , for life in general			2
' the goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper			1
' you can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do , the same as i can feel it with strikers			0
so , to be in a naturally good place is a lot better			0
' you 've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out			0
being in the right frame of mind always helps – we all have vulnerable parts , times in our game when you 're thinking the worst can happen			0
but you need to limit them as best you can			0
' ' i 've always kind of accepted in my role as a goalkeeper that making mistakes is going to happen			1
but turning it into a positive is something that i 've improved on , definitely			0
' @entity63 no 1 @entity0 denies @entity65 ace @entity64 as the former @entity67 man looms down on goal the @entity63 no 1 has been in fine form for his club this season , despite his defence struggling for form , but @entity0 admitted that making a save is n't quite the feeling as scoring a goal			1
' it 's a very good feeling , ' he says			2
' it 's a good surge			2
but the thing with making a save is that you ca n't run off and slide on your knees			0
unless you 've caught it , you 've either pushed it out into play or pushed it for a corner			0
' as good as making a good save can be , you 've got to be aware that five seconds later you can let one through your hands			0
' @entity63 's no 1 gets down low to deny @entity6 during his side 's defeat to @entity9 at the @entity11 despite going out of the @entity8 on wednesday , the 27 - year - old made a crucial penalty save against @entity6 to keep his side well and truly in it after the first leg			1
' penalties are an easy one to zone in on because it 's a one - on - one duel			1
there 's nothing that can be done – it 's not like someone can do a sneaky one when you 're not looking			2
' you try and make the moment as big for them as it is for you			2
some people are immune to that , and you 're wasting your time			0
but there 's a few people who it might help with			2
' saving one is a good feeling			0
in my head it 's all because of me			2
but , realistically , they might have just taken a bad penalty or made the wrong decision			0
anyone is more than capable of scoring past me from 12 yards , whatever team it is			0
