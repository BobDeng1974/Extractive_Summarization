by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:59 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 12 november 2013 it was an evening of fashion fails , shocks and awes at the star - studded 2013 @entity5 on sunday night			1
@entity6 , 20 , managed to turn heads for all the wrong reasons ( again ) in an ensemble resembling a bargain - bin find in an 80s thrift store , while @entity12 tried to out flash the @entity14 star			1
meanwhile @entity15 and @entity16 wowed the crowds at the @entity18 in @entity19 with their figure - revealing outfits			2
here @entity21 brings you our pick of the best - and worst - dressed ... we wish she 'd adhere to the message on her rear when it comes to flashing the flesh : @entity6 ' dress was adorned with pictures of @entity32 and @entity33 , with the words violence scrawled across the crotch area and please stop on the back @entity6 's plunging lace - up mini dress was adorned with pictures of @entity32 and @entity33 , with the words violence scrawled across the crotch area and please stop across the rear			1
the racy @entity43 number from @entity45 archives barely covered @entity6 's bottom and drawstrings just about kept the tiny piece of fabric attached to her slim frame			2
she completed her look with a selection of gold and silver jewels and monochrome chequered thigh - high boots from @entity57 2013			2
while the current bad girl of pop showed she definitely does n't feel the cold , she was n't the only car - crash on the red carpet			1
@entity6 's crotch - skimming number was rivalled by @entity12 's sheer black dress that was slashed all the way up to her bellybutton - as both stars proved it must be busy season for bikini waxers			1
the @entity71 rapper , 23 , suffered a shocking wardrobe malfunction which saw her bare all to the cameras as she readjusted her outfit			0
she seemed to forget she was being photographed as she lifted up her dress , seemingly to check everything was in order ' down below ' , and exposed her miniscule flesh - coloured pants			1
@entity80 certainly was n't afraid to flash the flesh in her revealing dress , which she topped off with red platform heels and a slick curled ponytail			1
too much ! @entity12 , 23 , suffered a shocking wardrobe malfunction which saw her bare all to the cameras as she readjusted her outfit camera ready : @entity12 , in her sheer black dress slashed all the way up to her bellybutton , proved it must be busy season for bikini waxers style aside , she seemed to get the colour of her ensemble bang on trend , as most stars seemed to opt for black at sunday night 's @entity5			1
@entity102 , @entity16 and @entity15 all joined the @entity104 rapper in choosing outfits in the classic shade			0
@entity16 continued her penchant for wearing very little to high - profile events as she opted for a daring sheer lace gown as she hit the red carpet			0
the @entity112 singer , 26 , dared to bare in the totally see - through number , proudly flaunting her black bra and pants which were revealed beneath			1
the burn hitmaker wore her long blonde locks hanging in loose waves around her shoulders , while opting for natural , dewy make - up			0
meanwhile , @entity15 opted for a relatively low - key look considering her usual wacky and wild sartorial tastes			0
the 22 - year - old singer turned on the old @entity125 glamour in a plunging black gown with a thigh - high split , featuring a sexy scooped back			2
showcasing her recently - dyed white platinum locks , the @entity112 star injected a welcome pop of colour to her ensemble with a slick of pillar - box red lipstick and dramatic eyeliner flicks racy : @entity102 with her gong @entity139 : @entity16 at arrivals sultry : @entity15 in the press room @entity102 , 29 , also went for black as she wore a fishnet skater dress paired with chunky @entity146 jewellery and red lips to collect her @entity148			1
but she arrived in an altogether more prim and elegant ensemble and changed again to perform , bringing us to our third style lesson of the night : multiple outfit changes are now compulsory			2
in her first outfit of the night , the @entity154 singer looked the picture of ladylike chic in a satin fishtail pencil dress featuring a conservative high neck and flattering knee - length hem			1
she completed her look with a pair of salmon pink platform sandals and a pretty jewelled headband as she smiled for the cameras , before embarking on two outfit changes			0
@entity12 , born @entity167 , also opted for three different outfits			2
arriving in her skimpy thigh - split number , the @entity170 rapper later changed into skinny leather trousers and plunging top , and then again into a space age silver stage outfit with matching lace - up knee - high boots to perform with @entity176			2
chameleon : @entity178 in elegant mint at arrivals ( left ) and performing onstage in an applique catsuit ( right ) during the @entity5 all change : @entity12 and @entity183 onstage ( left ) and the rapper in a silver get up to perform with @entity176 ( right ) @entity6 performs in her two different outfits : wearing a super-skimpy white leotard ( left ) and twerking in a silver dress ( right ) elsewhere , @entity189 showed that the mini is still in for @entity192 / @entity191 as she posed up a storm in a classy white number			1
the red carpet presenter looked positively showstopping as she paraded her seemingly endless pins in a daringly thigh - skimming minidress			0
featuring a flattering peplum detail , the strapless number was adorned with a dramatic lace and feather detail , which certainly ensured the @entity203 beauty stood out from the crowd as she hit the red carpet			0
but @entity189 , 28 , was disappointed that she was n't able to get changed three times throughout her presenting stint as planned ( as per the trend )			0
she had to jet off straight to @entity104 after fronting her segment of the awards to prepare for her next job on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity214			0
speaking to @entity215 , she said : ' i had three outfit choices for tonight , but sadly i wo n't be changing as i 'm flying straight out to @entity104			2
' adding even more height to her seemingly endless legs in a pair of black strappy sandals , @entity189 completed her striking look with her signature winged eyeliner and plum lips , while wearing her blonde locks tied back loosely from her face			0
legs on parade : @entity189 showed that the mini is still in for @entity192 / @entity191 as she posed up a storm in a classy white number @entity233 were recognised for their winning style on sunday as member @entity235 scooped the @entity236			0
the band also took home the awards for @entity240 and @entity241 & @entity242			0

@entity264 - @entity235 @entity243 - @entity6 - @entity14 @entity265 - @entity266 @entity256 - @entity267 @entity268 @entity252 - @entity249 @entity270 - @entity269 @entity271 @entity272 @entity273 @entity245 - @entity102 @entity274 - @entity275 @entity248 - @entity246 @entity276 - @entity277 best @entity279 & @entity278 @entity250 - @entity249			1

after that @entity283 outfit @entity6 *taught* us she really does n't feel the cold - in the tiniest *vintage* dress
@entity287 were on the grooming menu as the @entity14 singer and @entity12 flashed the flesh
classic black proved most popular colour of the night
three outfit changes minimum now seen as compulsory for stars - and even more for presenters
