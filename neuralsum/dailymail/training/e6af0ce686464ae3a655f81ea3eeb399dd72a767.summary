by @entity0 , political editor published : 18:40 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 18:40 est , 25 june 2013 @entity1 is facing a standoff with @entity3 after being summoned to give evidence to a @entity5 on the future of press regulation			1
the judge , who led last year ’s inquiry into media standards , was yesterday called to appear before the @entity8			1
he refused to answer questions on the day his report was published and is understood to have indicated that he has no desire to appear before mps , arguing that judges do not have to explain themselves to @entity17			1
@entity1 ( left ) has been called to appear in before the @entity8			1
@entity19 chair @entity18 said @entity3 want to hear @entity1 's view of the proposed @entity21 discussions between @entity17 and the lord chief justice , which started some months ago , are thought to have ended in stalemate			1
but yesterday members of the committee agreed at a private meeting to ask @entity1 to appear before them			1
they want him to face questions – expected to include the issue of why wider evidence of phone hacking and surveillance by law and insurance firms was not highlighted in his report – before the @entity5 begins its summer break on july 18			2
@entity18 , the committee ’s chairman , said : ‘ we would like to hear his views on the developments that have taken place since the publication of the report			2
we would like to hear his view of what is on the table			0
‘ he chaired an inquiry which made recommendations to @entity17 – it does n’t seem unreasonable that @entity17 ask him some questions about that			0
if he were a sitting judge delivering a verdict on a case , that would be different			0
that was n’t the case in this instance			0
’ if he agrees to appear , @entity1 will be questioned on the two rival versions of a @entity21 that would underpin a new media regulator – one produced after cross-party talks , and the other by the newspaper industry			1
@entity3 want to question him on two rival versions of a @entity21 that would underpin a new media regulator @entity1 is also likely to be questioned about the affair between @entity69 , a lawyer to his inquiry , and @entity72 , a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the press both are being considered by the @entity77 , an advisory body to the @entity79 which issues such charters			1
@entity1 is also likely to be questioned about the revelation that a lawyer to his inquiry had an affair with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the @entity75			2
@entity69 , a married mother of two , started a relationship with @entity72 , a barrister representing advocates of statutory press regulation			0
the invitation to @entity1 is believed to be the first time a judge has been publicly summoned to a commons select committee			1
however @entity94 , who led an inquiry into the death of government scientist dr @entity97 , gave evidence to the public administration select committee after he had retired as a judge			0
appearances by judges before mps are usually choreographed , with questioning limited to matters that do not draw judges into individual cases , criticism of public figures or political controversy			0
the rules that govern judicial select committee appearances state that it is ‘ extremely unusual and very unlikely to be the case that a parliamentary committee will order a judge to attend ’			0
asked whether the judge should appear before the committee , @entity117 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ it is a matter for him			0
’ a spokesman for the judiciary said : ‘ @entity1 has not received any communication from the committee			2
he will respond if and when he does			0

@entity3 want to question @entity1 on rival @entity21
judge refused to answer questions on day report was published
