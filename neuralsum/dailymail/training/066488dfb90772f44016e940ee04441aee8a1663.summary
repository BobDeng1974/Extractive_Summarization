by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 20:41 est , 8 february 2013 @entity1 , the disgraced former boss of @entity2 , faces demands to hand back up to £ 6 million in bonuses earned at the height of the rate rigging scandal			1
the state backed bank is preparing to appeal to @entity1 and former @entity2 investment bank chief @entity10 to voluntarily give up their awards after deciding that the chances of successful legal action would be slim			1
but these efforts to ‘ appeal to their better nature ’ were described last night as ‘ laughable ’ by critics			0
the news came as chief executive @entity19 also faced growing pressure to forfeit a £ 2 million bonus awarded in 2010			2
former @entity2 chief executive sir @entity1 , pictured , has been asked to repay the £ 6m bonus earned during the rate rigging scandal @entity2 , fined £ 390 million for criminally rigging crucial interest rates on wednesday , has already pledged to use special ‘ claw back ’ powers to recoup £ 300 million from staff			1
but the bank believes its only option is to ask @entity1 and @entity10 to voluntarily hand back some of the lavish rewards paid during their disastrous reign			1
banks only have the power to dock ‘ deferred ’ bonuses – issued in company shares - that have not yet paid out			2
@entity2 also introduced the policy in 2009 , after it received a £ 45 billion bail out from taxpayers , meaning it can not automatically recoup bonuses paid before then			1
this means those at the helm of @entity2 when the worst of the rate – rigging was going on are currently untouchable unless criminal statutes are enforced			1
one option is mounting a legal battle to retrieve some of @entity1 ’s bonuses if the disgraced former boss refuses to co-operate			1
@entity1 was stripped of his knighthood last year over his role in the bank ’s collapse			1
but insiders believe it would be too costly and the chances of success would be slim			0
chairman sir @entity59 said on wednesday that the option of asking ex directors to voluntarily hand back their bonuses is ‘ being addressed ’			0
under pressure : chief executive @entity19 is facing growing pressure to forfeit a £ 2 million bonus awarded in 2010 but this was slammed by critics			2
@entity68 , chair of the @entity69 said : ‘ they had to force @entity1 to give back some of his pension - it ’s highly unlikely that he will just hand back his bonus			2
’ she added : ‘ morally you ’d think @entity1 and @entity10 would feel some obligation to make amends for what happened under their make money at all costs culture			1
but @entity59 is assuming that bankers still have some moral standards when they are quite happy to just take the money and run			0
’ @entity1 ran @entity2 from 2000 until it collapsed in october 2008 , and was rescued with a £ 45 billion bail - out from taxpayers			1
the rigging of @entity88 interest rates started under his watch in january 2006 and went on until november 2010			0
@entity1 , received a £ 2.8 million bonus in 2006 and a £ 2.9 million pay out the following year when the worst of the wrong - doing occurred			1
he enjoys a £ 342,500 pension paid for by the taxpayer			2
he had been in line for a £ 550,000 annual pension , having cashed in a £ 2.7 million tax free lump sum , but was forced into giving up more than £ 200,000 a year after months of political pressure			0
other executives who could receive a call from @entity2 include @entity10 , the former head of the investment bank			1
@entity10 , who has received a lifetime ban from the @entity104 for his part in the bank ’s collapse , received over £ 4 million in bonuses , split between 2006 and 2007			1
this week @entity59 warned of the ‘ dangerous ’ consequences if rogue traders are not locked up			0
he pledged to help authorities investigating 21 @entity2 workers involved in manipulating interest rates			2
this includes six individuals still working at the bank			0
he said : ‘ if people do n’t end up in prison over this scandal i worry it will further perpetuate the sense that there is one rule for the financial system and another set of rules			0
’ incoming @entity128 governor @entity127 also described @entity88 rigging as ‘ reprehensible ’ and said it ‘ should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law in the various jurisdictions that are affected			0
’ chief executive @entity19 also came under fire last night for refusing to hand back a £ 2 million shares bonus awarded in 2010 while his traders cointinued to rig interest rates			2
half of this bonus is due to pay out this year			0
liberal democrat peer @entity140 said : ‘ the board looks more laughable by the day			0
asking @entity1 for a generous gesture now is like whistling in a hurricane			2
but the real test for the @entity2 board is to see how long it takes them to realise @entity148 can not possibly ckling on to his £ 2m bonus awarded in 2010 when the bank was still rigging rates			1
’ the row comes amid reports that scandal hit @entity155 is set to dish out between £ 1.5 billion and £ 2 billion in bonuses to staff for their work last year , despite being emboiled in a string of scandals			1
this would mark a drop from the £ 2.2 billion awarded for 2011 , £ 1.5 billion of which was paid to its investment bankers			1
but it comes after arguably its most shameful year in its 323 year history			0
in the summer it was slapped with a £ 290 million fine for rigging crucial interest rates			0
it set aside another £ 1.6 billion to pay compensation to customers mis - sold payment protection insurance			0
and it has built up an £ 850 million pot to compensate small businesses sold interest rate swaps alongside loans			0
these complex financial instruments were meant to protect firms , from care homes to hair salons , from rising interest rates			0
instead they often left businesses with crippling bills when rates fell to record lows			0
chief executive @entity188 has attempted to douse public anger by banning upfront cash bonuses for more than a thousand top investment bankers .			1

@entity1 ran @entity2 from 2000 until it collapsed in october 2008
@entity1 paid £ 6m bonuses earned at the height of the rate rigging scandal
