contamination of chicken with a potentially lethal food poisoning bug is getting worse , new evidence revealed today			0
the proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent at the same time , the number considered highly contaminated rose from 18 per cent to 18.9 per cent , according to figures from the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
simply picking up chickens from a shelf to check the price is also a risk , the @entity10 warned			1
it found the proportion of packs contaminated on the outside rose from 6 per cent to 6.8 per cent - or one in 14 packs			1
danger : the proportion of fresh roasting chickens on supermarket shelves carrying campylobacter is up from 70 per cent to 72.9 per cent			1
the bug is @entity24 ’s most common cause of food poisoning the increase compared to november figures suggest that supermarkets , farmers and processors are not doing enough to protect customers			0
an estimated 280,000 people fall ill and 100 people die every year because of campylobacter , which is @entity24 ’s most common cause of food poisoning			1
the @entity10 says the resulting cost to the @entity24 in terms of @entity39 treatment and lost productivity due to people being off work sick is a staggering £ 900 million			1
the figures come as a @entity45 study published today warned about the emergence of new ‘ superbug ’ versions of campylobacter , which are resistant to antibiotic medicines			1
as a result , doctors find it increasingly difficult to treat people who fall ill after handling and eating chicken			0
the @entity10 says it expects stores to reduce the number of birds that are highly contaminated to no more than 10 per cent by the end of the year			1
if this target is met - which seems unlikely - the @entity10 claims it would reduce the number of food poisoning cases by 84,000 and save around 30 lives a year			1
@entity64 , professor of microbial pathogenesis at the @entity66 , described the situation as ‘ scandalous ’			0
the professor , who has studied campylobacter for 25 years , called for urgent action from stores and the government to protect shoppers			1

the @entity10 says the resulting cost to the @entity24 in terms of @entity39 treatment and lost productivity due to people being off work sick is a staggering £ 900 million			1
the @entity10 figures show that @entity84 came out worst on virtually every measure with a contamination level of 78.9per cent and 31.1per cent at the highest level			1
by contrast , @entity88 , the co-op and @entity90 saw a fall in the number of birds with the highest contamination			2
‘ we have legislation to prevent harmful substances in our houses such as asbestos , yet we are happy to allow more than two out three chickens into our kitchens that can cause severe diarrhoea and in some cases can be life threatening , ’ he said			2
‘ it has to be stopped at source and poultry needs to be campylobacter - free , which could be achieved through vaccinating flocks			2
supermarkets and government agencies need to take responsibility			0
’ professor @entity64 said a number of vaccines are in development and this work must be accelerated with funding from the government , the industry and , potentially , supermarkets			2

dr @entity127 , a food microbiologist at the @entity128 , said contamination on the outside of packs is a real threat			0
‘ it is particularly concerning that so many chickens are being sold with bacteria on the outside of the packaging			2
' this hugely increases the risk of cross-contamination to other food in your supermarket trolley or your fridge , ’ he said			2
concern : the figures come as a @entity45 study published today warned about the emergence of new ‘ superbug ’ versions of campylobacter ( pictured ) , which are resistant to antibiotic medicines the @entity10 today praised @entity88 for leading the way in tackling the bug			1
the store has moved to selling chickens in ‘ cook in the bag ’ packs , paying farmers a bonus if they keep their flocks bug - free , and blast or rapid chilling the birds in an attempt to kill campylobacter			1
the store ’s own most recent survey covering found the proportion of birds contaminated at the highest levels was down to just three per cent in january			2
mr @entity172 said : ‘ we warmly welcome what @entity88 is doing			0
it shows that one retailer can achieve the target through a programme of systematic interventions and we think others can , and should , do the same			0
’ @entity84 said it has introduced new measures to protect consumers , however these will take time to deliver results			0
the majority of its chickens are now being sold as ‘ roast in the bag ’ and it is looking at treating carcasses with @entity190 , which uses steam and ultrasound to kill the bug			0
mr @entity172 added : ‘ @entity194 is killed by thorough cooking , but it should not be left to consumers to manage the risk			0
' it is the most common form of food poisoning in the @entity24 , affecting an estimated 280,000 people a year			0
‘ @entity203 is the source of the majority of these cases , so the industry should be making every effort to ensure chickens are as free from campylobacter as possible before they reach customers			1
@entity213 , executive director at consumer group which ? , said : ‘ it ’s unacceptable that we 're still seeing such high and rising levels of campylobacter in chicken			0
' people need reassurance that supermarkets are doing everything they can to make chicken safe			0
‘ this problem requires everyone in the food chain , from farmers , to supermarkets , and consumers , to improve practices if we want to cut infection rates			0
’ @entity232 , chief scientist at the @entity233 , said doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to treat people infected with superbug versions of campylobacter , which are resistant to antibiotic medicines such as fluoroquinolones			0
‘ the high levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones observed in campylobacter isolates - from both humans and chickens - are of concern , considering that a large proportion of human campylobacter infections come from handling , preparation and consumption of chicken meat , ’ he said			1
‘ such high resistance levels reduce the effective treatment options for severe human campylobacter infections			0
’ the @entity10 director of policy , @entity172 , said the onus is on stores to reduce the number of birds that carry high contamination to under 10 per cent by the end of 2015			1
he admitted the watchdog has no legal powers to punish stores that miss the target , however he said they would be held to account by customers			0
‘ @entity268 is running out for the industry to take action to meet the target , ’ he said .			0

72.9 **%** of fresh roasting chickens are carrying campylobacter , says @entity10
number considered to be ' highly contaminated ' rose from 18 to 18.9 **%**
simply picking up chickens from a shelf to check the price is also a risk
