by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:04 est , 26 february 2014 former casualty star @entity3 has admitted he is ‘ utterly shellshocked ’ after two men he called @entity6 - type @entity5 were cleared of an attack in which a chunk of his ear was gnawed off			1
@entity11 , 33 , admitted biting the 6ft 5in actor ’s ear after they clashed in a @entity16 hotel corridor in a late night row over noise last march , but claimed self - defence			2
he and his friend @entity20 , 32 , were cleared of grievous bodily harm ( @entity22 ) with intent and the lesser charge of @entity22 after a jury at @entity26 deliberated for almost five hours			1
trial : former casualty actor @entity3 said he is ' utterly shellshocked ' after @entity11 , right , and his friend @entity20 were cleared of @entity22 despite one biting part of his ear off the court heard how mr @entity20 and mr @entity11 , both of @entity33 , @entity34 , had been in the city for a weekend with friends and had been drinking heavily since earlier in the morning			1
mr @entity11 , his friends and mr @entity3 were all staying in the same @entity38 on @entity16 ’s @entity39 where the incident happened			1
relief : mr @entity20 smiled as he left @entity26 following the verdict yesterday the court heard how mr @entity20 and mr @entity11 had been in the corridor making a lot of noise when mr @entity3 , 56 , came out to ask them to quieten down on march 24 last year			1
there was then a scuffle in which mr @entity3 – who has starred in the hit tv show @entity50 – allegedly ran at the pair and they ended up locked in a fight			2
the court heard mr @entity3 was on top of mr @entity11 , who called him a ' big monster ' and feared ' he was trying to kill me ' so he admitted biting a part of mr @entity3 's ear off			1
it was put in a glass of water to preserve it , but that compromised the tissue and it could not be re-attached			0
neither of the acquitted men wanted to comment as they walked out of court with family members yesterday			0
but mr @entity3 issued a statement in which he said : ‘ i am utterly shellshocked by the verdict of the court , and have lost a great deal of faith in a process which can deliver such an injustice			1
‘ as much as i am hurt and baffled by the decision , i am more worried at the message it gives out to law - abiding people who dare to point out the terrible behaviour of others			0
are we all just meant to sit back and not say anything ? ‘ the fact that violent acts go unpunished is equally worrying			0
‘ i would like to thank my friends , family and hundreds of well - wishers for their support and i look forward to getting back to work			0
’ room for the night : mr @entity3 was staying at the £ 91 - a - night @entity92 while working in the area			1
but the jury did not accept he suffered @entity22 that night casualty star @entity3 ( left ) was left severely disfigured when part of his ear was bitten off during an incident at the @entity38 in @entity16 in march last year mr @entity3 was appearing in a touring production of @entity99 and was woken in his room by repeated shouting in the corridor outside			1
the actor went to summon security when there was a clash in which the three men ended on the floor and mr @entity3 ’s ear was severed			1
mr @entity11 claimed he was acting in self - defence after the actor charged at him and knocked him to the floor			2
he told the jury : ‘ i turned around and the next thing i was taken out by this big guy			0
it was like being hit by a car			0
i was on my back and mr @entity3 was straight on top of me			2
’ he believed he had no alternative but to bite mr @entity3 ’s ear to stop the attack			2
mr @entity11 told the court he had previously been in trouble for fighting and had been convicted of assault			0
he also said his brother had been stabbed to death			0
mr @entity20 said he saw the two wrestling on the floor and tried to intervene			0
he told the court : ‘ i started shouting , telling him to walk away , please walk away , you do n’t need to do this			0

@entity11 and @entity20 cleared of causing grievous bodily harm
mr @entity3 lost a *substantial* part of his ear in a @entity92 melee last year
@entity11 said he was defending himself from the ' big monster ' who he believed ' was going to kill him '
