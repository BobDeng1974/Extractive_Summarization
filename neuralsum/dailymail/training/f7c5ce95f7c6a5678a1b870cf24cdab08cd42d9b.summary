remarkable new images from the @entity2 spacecraft have revealed the surface of its comet like never before			1
in the pictures an incredible amount of detail can be spotted - including boulders on the surface and dust moving across plains			1
the images come as @entity14 prepares to attempt to land a probe on the comet in two weeks			1
@entity14 , headquartered in @entity17 , has released new images of @entity2 's comet ( mosaic shown )			1
they reveal fascinating details on the surface including boulders			1
sand dunes can also be seen on the comet 's surface the latest images of comet @entity28 were taken from a distance of 9.8km from the comet ’s centre and revealed in a blog post by @entity14			1
four new images have been released , which have been combined into one mosaic image			0
in those images the scale is about 26 inches ( 66 cm ) per pixel			0
the mosaic covers about 3,940 to 4,430ft ( 1,200 to 1,350 metres ) on the comet ’s surface			0
towards the upper left of the image is an area of bright material that was cast in shadow in previous images , possibly at the base of a cliff			1
a recent landslide of sorts may have uncovered this material			0
@entity14 adds though that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading , as the comet is actually blacker than coal			2
in order to make features visible the images are grey - scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter			0
it 's thought some sort of landslide may have revealed bright material seen at the bottom of this image under what appears to be a cliff			1
this image and the next three were used to make he mosaic @entity14 is preparing to attempt to land a probe called @entity72 on the comet in two weeks the images also take another look at a pyramid - like rock on the comet			1
this was named @entity79 by @entity14 after the pyramid on @entity81			1
it is seen here as the largest boulder just left and down of the centre @entity14 adds though that the brightness of the images is a little bit misleading , as the comet is actually blacker than coal			2
in order to make features visible the images are grey - scaled and also set to a high contrast to make them appear brighter ' also not seen previously in this much detail are the two boulders just below the centre of the mosaic , one of which takes on a heart - shaped appearance from this angle , ' space science editor @entity94 write for @entity14 on the blog			1
' zooming in reveals hints of a layered structure and both objects seems to be appearing from beneath the dusty layer , just like some of the smaller ‘ boulders ’ around them			0
' within the images can also be seen a mysterious pyramid - shaped rock that was previously spotted by @entity14			1
it can be seen just above the middle in the mosaic			0
at around 82ft - tall ( 25 metres ) , the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history			2
@entity79 , taken by @entity2 ’s @entity124 camera on 19 september , from a distance of 17.7 miles ( 28.5km ) in this image released on 18 october , meanwhile , sand dunes can be seen drifting down the centre the ' pyramid ' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of @entity28 's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at @entity137 near @entity138 in @entity139			1
@entity14 named the structure @entity79 , after the largest of those pyramids , the @entity140 , which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh cheops around 2550 bc. @entity2 has spent 10 years chasing down comet @entity144 and is now in orbit around the ' ice mountain ' , edging in closer to its surface each day			1
for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity154 and @entity2 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			2
the ' pyramid ' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of @entity28 's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at @entity137 near @entity138 in @entity139 a patchwork of images of comet @entity167 from a distance of 10.5 miles ( 16.9km ) from the centre of the comet @entity2 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week			1
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity179 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible as @entity2 continues to survey and monitor the comet 's surface in the next months , the scientists will be looking for clues to better explain the formation of the comet			1
last month a 2.4 mile - wide ( 4km ) region on the ' head ' of comet @entity144 was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity2 's @entity72 probe			1
the high - risk manoeuvre on november 12 , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			0
scientists at mission control in @entity201 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity81 's water and perhaps even life			2
but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity2 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			0
the recent decision that the mission is ' go ' for @entity213 confirms the timeline of events leading up to the landing of @entity72 on @entity2			0
@entity2 will release @entity72 at 08:35 gmt / 09:35 cet on 12 november at a distance of approximately 14 miles ( 22.5km ) from the centre of the comet			2
the landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 gmt / 16:30 cet			0
during the seven - hour descent , @entity72 will take images and conduct science experiments , sampling the dust , gas and plasma environment close to the comet			2
it will take a ' farewell ' image of the @entity2 orbiter shortly after separation , along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface			2
it is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on @entity81 several hours after separation			2
once safely on the surface , @entity72 will take a panorama of its surroundings			0
again , this is expected back on @entity81 several hours later			0
the first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours , constrained by the lander 's primary battery lifetime			0
longer - term study of the comet by @entity72 will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge , which in turn is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels			0
in any case , it is expected that by march 2015 , as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the @entity261 , temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations , and @entity72 's science mission will come to an end			0
the @entity2 orbiter 's mission will continue for much longer			2
it will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the @entity261 in august 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer @entity274			0
the reconstructed - colour image indicates how dark the comet really appears			0
on average , the comet 's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light , making it as dark as coal last month a 2.4 mile - wide ( 4km ) region on the ' head ' of comet @entity144 was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity2 's @entity72 probe ( illustration shown )			1
the high - risk manoeuvre on november 12 , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			0
