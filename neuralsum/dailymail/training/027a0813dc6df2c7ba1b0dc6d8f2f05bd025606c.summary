by @entity0 everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol - busting statins , an eminent heart surgeon says everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol - busting statins , an eminent heart surgeon says			1
professor sir @entity6 , who has carried out more heart transplants than anyone else , said the benefits of taking the controversial drugs ‘ massively ’ outweigh the risks and to not make them more widely available is ‘ lunacy ’			1
sir @entity6 , professor of cardiothoracic surgery at @entity16 , also believes statins should be available without a prescription			1
statins are the most - widely prescribed drugs in @entity18 and are credited with saving thousands of lives a year by preventing heart attacks and strokes			1
but a row is raging about their side - effects			0
a report published in the @entity26 said the cholesterol - lowering drugs , taken by eight million @entity18 , cause side - effects such as liver and kidney disease and diabetes in one in five patients			1
parts of the article were withdrawn last week , following repeated criticism from an @entity37 academic that the risks had been exaggerated up to 20-fold			0
sir @entity39 said the figure is one in 100 and described the published claims as a ‘ huge error ’ that will ‘ cause unnecessary deaths ’ by discouraging patients from taking the medicine			2
now , sir @entity6 has said that stopping taking the drugs would be disastrous			1
he told @entity47 ’s today programme on saturday that he found the row very upsetting , adding : ‘ it is almost certainly going to result in people not taking statins and that is a major worry to many of us because the evidence is overwhelming , the lower the cholesterol , the healthier you are and the longer you will live			2
‘ not only that , it prevents heart attacks and strokes but also cancer , dementia			0
so not to take statins is a disaster			0
’ he then called for the drugs to be easier to access – and for more people to take @entity6 said he believed statins should be available from chemists without prescription and that everyone over 40 should take them			1
he said that side - effects pale into insignificance when compared with the benefits and ‘ not to make use of what we have is lunacy ’			2
statins are the most - widely prescribed drugs in @entity18 and are credited with saving thousands of lives a year by preventing heart attacks and stroke sir @entity6 said : ‘ the drug has been around for 25 years or so and we do know the long - term results and exactly what it does biochemically			1
‘ we know exactly how to monitor any complications which are very minor compared to the benefits so i do n’t see the problem			0
’ currently , the prescription of statins is based on health , rather than age , with anyone judged to have a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack in the next decade offered them			2
but millions more could soon take the pills , as the cut - off is expected to be lowered to 10 per @entity99 doctors have questioned the mass - medication of essentially healthy people and say there are better ways of spending @entity105 money			0
dr @entity106 , a gp and associate medical director at the @entity109 , said : ‘ i am not sure we are yet in a position where everybody over a certain age should be prescribed a statin			0
‘ even if in theory it would have public health benefits it could turn life into a disease			0
