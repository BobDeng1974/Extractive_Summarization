by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 7 june 2013 it 's officially @entity2 summertime and for millions of women that means the inevitable countdown to baring it all on the beach			0
but struggling into a skimpy bikini after a winter of comfort food and covering up is rarely a moment women look forward to			0
it comes as no surprise then that the classic one - piece has been voted the number one swimsuit of choice this summer , with over half of insecure @entity2 opting for the more conservative style			2
covering up : like @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , over half of @entity20 are now opting for one - piece swimsuits over bikinis this summer in comparison just 8 per cent of us would dare to bare in a two - piece bikini style and a tiny 1 per cent of @entity20 confirm they would n't brave it with a thong shaped swimsuit			1
one fashion e-tailer has seen sales of swimsuits soar 80 per cent over the last month as the warm weather hits and holiday fever sets in			0
following in the footsteps of celebrities such as @entity21 and @entity23 , sales of one - piece swimsuits on @entity41 have shot up by 110 per cent , with sales of tankinis not far behind , rising 60 per cent since this time last month			1
the research also found that over a quarter of @entity20 only start preparations to perfect their beach bodies just a few days ahead of their holiday and over a third of @entity20 admitted that they carry out no preparation at all			0
so despite what your gloating @entity55 friends are telling you , only one in 10 kick start their beach body routine six months or more before hitting the pool side			0
style watch : the triangle / halter neck bikini is most favoured in @entity65 , while a bandeau style would most likely be spotted on @entity67 according to a ' swimwear map of @entity2 ' put together by the e-tailer , @entity69 ladies are the most daring when it comes to their choices in swimwear , with one in five of those surveyed from the area opting for a push - up bikini			1
women from @entity78 are the most conservative , with a massive 73 per cent opting for a one - piece style			2
the triangle / halter neck bikini is most favoured in @entity65 with 17 per cent opting for this look			1
a bandeau style is most likely to be spotted on @entity67 with one in 10 women from @entity85 choosing this option			0
a spokesman for @entity88 said : â€˜ with the warm weather setting in , we are seeing a huge increase in the sales of swimwear on the site with sales of the classic one - piece style overtaking bikini sales for the first time			1
