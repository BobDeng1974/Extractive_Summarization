those who achieve greatness are high achievers from an early stage			0
they know this better than most at @entity5			2
by the time he was 20 in december 1999 , his list of accomplishments read like the wish - list of many footballers			2
he had been named @entity11 ( 1998 ) , scored one of the greatest @entity14 finals goals and won @entity15			1
there were also 18 @entity18 caps and he had passed 50 career goals for @entity20			1
@entity21 , pictured in training on thursday , has rejected a new contract worth £ 100,000 - a - week @entity21 trains with his @entity20 team - mates at @entity25 as the @entity26 prepare to face @entity27 on saturday @entity20 boss @entity28 ( right ) insists that @entity21 will not be sold in the summer transfer window then there is @entity31			1
another @entity32 ( 1995 ) , he had entered the record books by scoring the fastest hat - trick in the @entity35 on his way to 50 goals by his 20th birthday and won his first major honour ( the 1995 @entity40 )			1
@entity43 ended his first season as a @entity20 regular with a @entity47 performance in the 1992 @entity49 final win over @entity50			2
@entity51 's first year out of his teens saw him collect the @entity40 , the @entity49 and the @entity53			1
that is the barometer by which those on the @entity57 judge prodigies			0
so let us now look at the cv of @entity21 , who was 20 on december 8 last year			1
it currently reads : @entity62 2013 - 2014 and @entity64 's @entity63 2014			0
there are also 14 @entity18 caps and one goal			0
@entity51 had won three trophies in the first year out of his teens including the @entity49 and @entity53 @entity6 scored this memorable goal against @entity71 at the @entity72 when he was just 18 @entity6 had been named @entity15 and scored over 50 goals when he hit 20 @entity43 lifts the @entity49 in 1992 after helping @entity20 defeat @entity50 at @entity75 @entity31 was @entity11 in 1995 and scored the @entity35 's fastest hat - trick good ? yes			1
great ? no. just 18 months ago he could n't even get a start for @entity20			2
this should not come across as an attempt to belittle @entity21 's talents — he is undeniably exciting — but he has become embroiled in a storm that has made him out to be on par with the four men named above			2
his comments in that ridiculously misguided @entity15 interview about wanting to challenge for trophies in his career and playing with the best players evoked memories of the @entity94 affair			2
he is absolutely not in the same sphere as the @entity96			0
' that was probably @entity21 looking over the course of the next 15 years if he plays to 35 , ' @entity28 observed on thursday			1
' players now look to later in their career and their life			0
but i can only focus on here , @entity20 and what is best for now			0
as a 20 - year - old , he 's not at that level			1
' we think that it will be best for him here and we will work hard to ensure he stays			0
' @entity21 receives @entity64 's @entity63 award ahead of a game against @entity27 in december last year @entity21 was named @entity20 's @entity11 for 2013 - 14 but he is miles behind @entity94 @entity21 's first and only @entity18 goal arrived against @entity115 in a @entity117 qualifier last friday @entity20 should n't have to work hard to keep @entity21			1
his advisors have every right to look to maximise their client 's earnings but , somewhere and somehow , they have lost sight of the bigger picture and a series of dreadful judgements have been made			0
the first signs that all was not well came on october 3 when @entity127 ran a back page story with the headline ' @entity57 fight to keep @entity21 '			0
that the story came after @entity21 had been anonymous in a 1 - 0 @entity133 defeat in @entity134 did n't do him any favours			1
there have been a raft of similar stories , a lot of which have either coincided with games that have gone against @entity20 — such as when their fate in the @entity133 was condemned in december — or ones in which he has played well , @entity18 against @entity115 being a prime example			0
@entity21 , pictured in action against @entity146 , has only scored six @entity35 goals so far this season @entity21 is expected to start for @entity20 when they take on @entity27 at the @entity148 on saturday the former @entity150 youngster is wanted by clubs including @entity27 , @entity146 , @entity152 and @entity153 as he looks to steer @entity20 into the @entity133 and win the @entity49 , @entity28 could do without this sideshow unfolding and so , more than anyone , could @entity21			1
if he wants to get to the level of @entity6 , @entity31 or @entity51 , he needs to influence the games that matter			1
he has been regularly championed for his strength , pace and trickery after being given a platform on which to thrive by @entity28			0
deep down , @entity21 will know what his manager has done for him			0
now is the time to pay him back — and show potential , perhaps , can become something more substantial .			0

@entity21 has rejected a new contract worth £ 100,000 - a - week
@entity20 boss @entity28 says @entity21 wo n't be sold this summer
his achievements at 20 are not on the same level as some @entity5 greats
@entity51 won three trophies in the first year out of his teens
@entity6 had scored more than 50 career goals for @entity20
@entity21 has a long way to go if he is to fulfil his huge potential
