having scored with their first shot on target against @entity3 , @entity4 have not found the net in 526 minutes since			1
take two teams without a @entity8 win to their name this season – in @entity4 ’s case one without a goal in almost eight hours of football now – and the outcome at @entity15 was rather predictable			1
@entity17 ’s side have played 470 minutes since @entity18 stunned @entity3 in the opening game of the season here with a strike that ultimately counted for nothing			1
the elation of that moment has long since faded with @entity4 picking up three points from their opening five games			1
@entity28 ( r ) and @entity4 boss @entity17 are both still looking for a first league win this season @entity30 have fared little better , although they had at least scored five coming into this encounter			1
both teams did their best to improve on those records and there was plenty of effort yesterday but also a distinct lack of craft			0
both came agonisingly close to that first win in the closing minutes when @entity4 substitute @entity42 saw his effort deflected against the bar and @entity30 ’s @entity45 had a 30 - yard shot turned against the post by @entity48			1
but neither manager was particularly overjoyed with another draw , even though @entity17 remains positive that @entity4 will find their way in the top - flight			1
@entity53 ( r ) hinted that @entity30 could be struggling with the mental side of their game their next two games are against @entity57 and @entity58 , and that first win can not come soon enough			1
‘ league tables are for other people to talk about but if we keep playing like that i ’m convinced there are wins around the corner , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ i ’m not naïve			0
i know you have to score goal to win games , but you also got to believe in performance levels and ours are very good			2
over time , if you keep putting up those kind of performances it ’s my belief that you will win games			0
‘ overall we probably edged it			0
we had one hit the bar and a couple of big penalty shouts , one in the second half against @entity84 ( @entity85 )			0
anywhere else on the pitch that ’s a foul so it ’s got to be given			0
but it ’s tough on for referees , the hardest part of the job is defining those moments			0
’ @entity17 claims @entity85 ( c ) could have earned a penalty after a challenge from @entity92 @entity17 was referring to a collision between @entity85 and @entity92 which was ignored by referee @entity94			2
the @entity95 actually threw himself to the floor far more dramatically , perhaps forgetting that he was in his own penalty box			0
leading the line in the absence of the injured @entity101 and @entity102 , two strikers who contributed 46 goals to @entity4 ’s promotion campaign last season , @entity85 was a handful throughout			1
@entity53 and @entity108 had their arms all over him at times , but even that was not enough when he broke away from @entity108 in the second half to force a fine diving save from @entity115			2
‘ i thought he was top drawer , a real handful , ’ added @entity17			2
‘ if i was a centre - half i would n’t have enjoyed playing against him today , that ’s for sure			0
’ @entity121 ( c ) missed a chance to break the deadlock on his first league start for @entity4 @entity121 , making his first league start for @entity4 alongside @entity85 , wasted a great chance as early as the fourth minute when he failed to connect with @entity128 ’s pullback , and @entity129 drilled another low effort straight at @entity115 from 15 yards			2
@entity92 was @entity30 ’s most lively player but having failed to trouble @entity48 with a 25 - yard effort in the first half , his low cross in the second looked destined to present @entity135 with a simple tap - in at the far post before @entity138 intervened with a marvellous back - heeled clearance			1
the match came alive in the dying stages when @entity142 tried to block a shot from @entity42 on the edge of the area in the 86th minute and the ball looped over @entity115 but came back off the bar			0
then @entity30 were inches away from claiming that elusive victory as they also hit the woodwork in added time			2
@entity30 's @entity45 reacts after hitting the post in injury time @entity153 played a freekick square across the pitch and when it was passed back to him decided to try his luck from fully 30 yards			2
@entity48 ’s view was impeded as it flew through a crowded box but he touched the ball against the post and was then relieved to see it deflect against his body and away to safety			0
events at @entity165 will no doubt ease the pain for @entity30 , but @entity28 wore the look of a manager who is growing increasingly frustrated with their indifferent start			1
‘ we played okay , but okay is not enough in the @entity8 , ’ said @entity28			1
‘ we played the way i want for three or four minutes every now and then but not consistently enough			0
‘ it was a great opportunity to take the three points			0
i ’ll take a clean sheet today but nothing else			0

@entity30 drew 0 - 0 with @entity4 in @entity8 clash on *saturday*
@entity28 is still waiting for a first win of the season
@entity17 remains confident that the @entity4 will come good
@entity53 hints @entity30 may be struggling with mental side of game
