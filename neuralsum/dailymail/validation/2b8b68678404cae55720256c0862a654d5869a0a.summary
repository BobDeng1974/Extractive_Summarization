scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species which could have grown to 65ft tall â€“ three times the height of a @entity3			2
nicknamed the @entity5 , the creature would have been among the largest to roam the @entity6 100 million years ago			1
it is thought to be related to the @entity8 which grew to 131ft long and weighed 90 tons - the equivalent of nine african elephants			1

pictured : fragments taken for examination the news comes after experts in @entity16 discovered fossils in rocks on the banks of the @entity20 in @entity21 in 2008			1
the rocks could not be removed so scientists from @entity29 extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination , @entity26 reported			1
dr @entity32 , a scientific researcher in the @entity33 , said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore			2
it took many years of research to discover it was an entirely new dinosaur			1
it is thought a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly identified species			1
he told the newspaper : ' when we discovered this finding , it was only clear that the remains belonged to a very large herbivorous dinosaur from the sauropods group			1
it was the first scientifically described dinosaur from this group in @entity16			1
' now after work on the extraction of all the remnants and the restoration ( of the bones ) are almost completed , we can confidently say that we have found a new species , and maybe even genus			2
dr @entity32 ( pictured left ) said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore the rocks could not be removed so scientists from @entity29 extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination ' if we talk about our discovery , this dinosaur lived in the @entity71 , that is about 100 million years ago			1
' experts believe a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly discovered species			1
dr @entity32 said : ' we constantly find the remains of dinosaurs on this site , near @entity82 village			0
they fall down from the steep river bank regularly and we collect them			0
' bones including part of a shoulder blade will be exhibited permanently in @entity89 of @entity29			0
they were named after the mythical titans of @entity93 - giant deities of incredible strength			0
titanosaurs have very long necks and whip - like tails , tiny heads and thick stumpy legs			2
they ate plants and were armoured with small bony plates along its back which helped protect them from predators			0
titanosaurs were some of the biggest dinosaurs to ever walk the earth and weighed up to 90 tons			0
pictured : fossil fragments @entity111 , director of studies in @entity113 at @entity114 , said it is not rare to find dinosaur remains , but the discovery is notable because it suggests the large herbivores lived in areas they have not been found in before			0
he said : ' it is a case of look and usually you will find			0
although , they are animals that lived on land and because of that the chances of them being preserved is less than if they were creatures in the seas or rivers , so they are certainly rarer			0
' on that basis the discovery that has been made is interesting because it is from a part of the world that has n't yielded these particular sorts of dinosaurs			0
' it therefore increases the geographic range - they have been found in @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 before			0
' dr @entity111 said @entity106 are large ling - necked dinosaurs which travelled in herds			0
he said : ' it is an animal a bit like @entity149 , the dinosaur in the hall of the @entity152 - it is that sort of shape			0
it is long - necked and has a long tail with an elephant sized body			2
' he said dinosaur footprints suggest they travelled in herds with the largest members on the outside creating a kind of ring of steel which protected the women and children in the centre .			2
