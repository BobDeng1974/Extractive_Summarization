a kitchen with a lavatory at one end – it would be hard to imagine a more unsanitary place to live			2
this unappealing arrangement is what planning officers found when they investigated outbuildings that they suspected fell foul of planning laws			1
these are the grotty living quarters in @entity12 of @entity13 , a chef from the @entity15 who has been living in the @entity17 for eight years @entity19 's action in @entity12 comes at a time of growing controversy over the use of garden sheds to house low - paid immigrants in areas where property commands high prices			1
the city has a large student population but @entity32 ’s agriculture and food processing sectors have proved a strong magnet for thousands of @entity35 immigrants			0
the influx has led property developers to rent out renovated garages and sheds			0
yesterday a chef from the @entity15 said he has lived in another concrete outbuilding since may and said he was ‘ very happy ’ there			2
@entity13 , 32 , who moved to @entity17 eight years ago , said : ‘ when i come back from work it ’s nice to be able to rest here			0
i do n’t want to move and it is just nice to enjoy our quiet life here			0
it does n’t bother me			0
’ the toilet - come - kitchen was found in this brick out building behind a semi-detached house in a separate bungalow were bedrooms for two people which feature a @entity15 flag landlord @entity58 clashed with his local authority when he built a back garden chalet bungalow with three bedrooms , a lounge , a kitchen and a bathroom on the site of an old garage			1
the two ramshackle homes were built behind this property in @entity12 where there is a shortage of housing but when council bosses told him they intended to take enforcement action , he removed the kitchen and placed it in a nearby outbuilding , which was already equipped with a toilet			1
he claimed this showed that the new building ’s residents used facilities in the main house and it was therefore not separate accommodation			2
however , the plan failed and he has now been ordered to tear down the bungalow			1
he intends to appeal against the ruling			2
mr @entity58 , who has two tenants in the outhouse and two in the bungalow , claimed the toilet was installed for people working on the site and the kitchen was not properly fitted			1
‘ the kitchen was temporary and was moved into the shed holding the toilet so the tenants did n’t have to all use the kitchen in the main house , ’ he said			1
‘ i intend to appeal and i will not let my tenants become homeless			2
’ @entity103 councillor @entity102 said : ‘ i have never seen anything like that in three - and - a - half years of evaluating planning applications and i hope it is a one - off			0
’ @entity109 councillor @entity108 added : ‘ there has to be controls to make sure these places are safe and reasonable , especially in a city where there ’s such a shortage of accommodation that people will live wherever they can find			0
’ earlier this year the @entity118 published a map created with heat - imaging cameras that showed garden outbuildings in a @entity123 street where officials believe as many as 1,000 migrants could have been living secretly			0
the discovery , in @entity127 , west @entity123 , led borough leaders to believe there may be 20,000 sheds rented out to 50,000 immigrants			0
this shed housed two people but mr @entity58 has now been ordered to tear it down after a visit from city planners			1

@entity138 found in kitchen of an outhouse
two people also lived in a bungalow behind the house in @entity12
landlord @entity145 has been ordered to tear the bungalow down
however one tenant says he does *n't* mind the *conditions*
mr @entity58 says he is planning to appeal the *decision*
