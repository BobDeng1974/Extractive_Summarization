it is a dilemma faced by anyone invited to meet the queen : what exactly does one wear ? this sniper serving with the @entity5 opted for his work outfit ... leaving the @entity2 looking more than a little perplexed			1
looking like @entity8 from the movie blockbuster @entity9 , the crack marksman wore a ' ghillie suit ' , a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble heavy foliage , leaves and twigs to remain concealed from the enemy			2
the suit even moves in gusts of wind			0
perplexed : @entity2 as she meets a sniper from the @entity5 at @entity21 in @entity22 today the @entity2 as she meets a veteran @entity23 called ' @entity24 ' in her visit today he also wore @entity28 - issue brown boots and carried a powerful sniper rifle while chatting to her majesty			1
@entity2 , dressed in a long violet coat with a matching hat , met soldiers and horses from the @entity5 when she visited @entity21 in @entity22 today			1
she also took a tour of the training school where she saw a riding lesson being undertaken by trooper @entity38 , 19 , from @entity39 , @entity40			0
trooper @entity38 has been learning to ride for four weeks , after joining the @entity28 in march			0
the @entity2 asked him about his horse , which is named @entity2 after her and is often ridden by the princess royal at the @entity44 in june each year			1
members of the @entity5 dressed in camouflage meet the @entity2 on her visit to the barracks the @entity2 laughs with a soldier as she eyes up machinery during her tour of the barracks she was also impressed to know that joining the @entity28 was what @entity54 had always wanted to do			1
and the @entity2 , who famously loves horses , petted a drum steed called @entity58 ' in @entity59 - who will be on official duty for the first time when the emir of @entity64 visits @entity22 tomorrow			1
the drum horse was renamed @entity66 today in commemoration of the @entity68			0
smiling away : the @entity2 speaks with trooper @entity38 who joined the @entity28 in march dressed in purple , the @entity2 is shown around the barracks which dates back to 1804 a soldier chats to the @entity2 as she takes a walk around the @entity21 situated less than a mile away from @entity74 the @entity2 also seemed intrigued when shown armoured fighting vehicles which were at the forefront of @entity78 ’s military operations in the @entity79 , @entity80 and more recently in @entity81 and @entity82			2
she asked soldiers about their families and their time in @entity82			2
she then took part in a photograph with 875 members of both regiments			0
@entity21 is less than a mile from @entity74 and dates back to 1804			0
