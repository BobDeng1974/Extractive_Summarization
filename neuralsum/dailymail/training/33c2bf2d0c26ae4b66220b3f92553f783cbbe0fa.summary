by @entity0 and @entity1 police have no idea where he is : murderer @entity4 has been on the run since fleeing an open prison four years ago police were under fire last night for taking four years to warn the public that a dangerous murderer was on the run from an open prison			1
@entity4 , who was convicted of stabbing a @entity13 theatre manager to death , walked out of @entity16 prison in june 2010			1
police considered him so dangerous that he should not be approached by the public , but not a single appeal was made for help catching him until yesterday			2
@entity4 , 57 , had been in open conditions for less than a year when he absconded from the prison near @entity23 , @entity24			1
officers said they had decided to act only after concluding he was probably no longer in the county			2
@entity29 mp @entity28 , who has campaigned for tighter rules on open prisons , said : ‘ it is quite extraordinary that this is only just coming to light now			2
the public should have been informed straight away			0
‘ people need to know for their own safety			0
if the authorities had to make an announcement every time somebody absconded , i suspect a much more robust system would soon be put in place			0
’ @entity4 was jailed indefinitely at the @entity43 in december 1974 for a crime that shocked the nation			1
the sentence – in this case , the juvenile equivalent of a life term – meant he would be detained until the prison authorities decided it was safe to release him			1
he was 17 when he and his brother @entity51 , 19 , and @entity52 , 17 , killed @entity54 stage manager @entity53			0
prosecutors claimed @entity51 posed as a rent boy to lure mr @entity53			0
he was robbed before being fatally stabbed in the neck with a flick - knife on @entity59 over the @entity60			0
all three youths admitted robbing him			0
@entity4 was convicted of murder			1
the other two were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for up to six years			2
absconded : @entity4 was moved to @entity16 near @entity23 , @entity24 , and left there on day release on june 19 , 2010 , police said the fact that @entity4 has been at large for four years was made public by @entity67 just 24 hours after the @entity68 revealed how murderer @entity69 was able to walk out of jail and go on the run for nine years			1
the disappearance of the 53 - year - old @entity73 should have triggered a manhunt after he absconded from an open prison in @entity76 in 2005 , but local police refused to look for him and did not alert the public			1
back in jail : @entity81 ' @entity80 he was able to reinvent himself as a respectable member of society , renting a flat , claiming thousands in benefits , getting a passport and going to @entity87 on holiday			0
@entity89 , who murdered teenager @entity90 in 1984 , was recaptured only after the @entity68 was tipped off about him , traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act			0
it was left to the @entity94 , which dealt with his murder , to travel to @entity97 and arrest him			0
finally making a public appeal yesterday for @entity4 ’s capture , pc @entity99 , from @entity67 , said : ‘ we have been looking for @entity4 for several years without success , which suggests he has left @entity106 and could be elsewhere in the country			1
we need to speak to anyone who could have any idea where he is or where he could be			0
’ he added : ‘ there is nothing to suggest @entity4 is currently a danger to the public , but he has not served his sentence , so we want to get him back into custody so justice can be done			1
’ @entity4 was said to have links to @entity118 and the @entity119 , and may have family in @entity121 , according to police			1
he may also be using the alias @entity124			0
@entity67 said : ‘ if you see @entity4 , do not approach him but call 999 immediately			2
’ last month @entity80 , 55 , an armed robber known as the @entity126 , walked out of an open prison in @entity128 and held up a building society in @entity130 before being recaptured			1
ministers said inmates should no longer be kept in open conditions or given a temporary release if they had absconded before .			2

he fled open prison in @entity24 in 2010 while out on day release
