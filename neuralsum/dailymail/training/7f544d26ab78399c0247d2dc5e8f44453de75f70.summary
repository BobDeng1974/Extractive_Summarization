@entity0 was too hot for @entity1 in @entity2			2
he may not be in the class of @entity4 — although he ’s probably not inferior to the tune of £ 59million , as their transfer fees suggest — but he is still a goalscorer capable of defining a match from nowhere , and every title - chasing team needs at least one			0
as football becomes increasingly mired in five - man midfields , the biggest games will be decided by one moment of individual genius			1
there is no doubt @entity0 is capable of providing that			2
yet he is still a risk , no matter how many assurances his new employers require			0
it is not what @entity0 does that is the problem , but the tension his maverick presence can create			1
inbound : will @entity0 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) fire @entity29 and @entity30 to glory ? deadly : @entity0 wheels away after scoring for @entity33 against @entity1 at the @entity34 in june popular : @entity0 signs autographs for @entity29 supporters after leaving @entity38 training ground on friday smile for the cameras : @entity0 waves as he arrives at @entity38 for his medical on friday when @entity0 was at @entity43 it seemed the club was never out of the headlines			1
it was n’t ‘ why always me ? ’ but ‘ why always us ? ’ — and there is enough pressure on @entity29 already this season without @entity0 drawing the eyes of the world to @entity53			1
it is no coincidence @entity29 ’s best season was also @entity4 ’s quietest off the field			1
@entity29 need to go about their business this season with the minimum of commotion : @entity0 has all the gift for tranquility of a 10 - year - old with a birthday drum kit			2
ordered off : former @entity43 striker @entity0 is shown a red card against @entity67 in 2012 business as usual : @entity29 players train at @entity38 on sunday ahead of their match against @entity43 so , where does @entity28 fit in ? @entity28 was as good as any player at @entity74 last season , even @entity76			1
one imagines if coach @entity77 had control over transfer policy he would not be on his way out			0
@entity74 need to feed the brand image annually , however , and @entity83 was one of the stars of the @entity34			0
so he ’s in and @entity28 is out — and @entity30 are the beneficiaries			2
@entity28 ’s fee , anywhere between £ 60million and £ 75m depending on reports , would put him up with the greatest players in the world			0
is he worth that ? perhaps to a club that needs a world - class attacking wide player to complete their vision			0
is that @entity30 , though , particularly when @entity97 ’s game plan calls for wing - backs ? where , for instance , does this leave @entity102 , the one bright spark for @entity30 last season ? can @entity28 and @entity102 protect a back three ? and what then happens to @entity107 ? on the move ? @entity74 star @entity28 looks set to sign for @entity30 this week in the last transfer window , @entity30 responded to growing frustration with the £ 37m marquee signing of @entity112 from @entity113			1
at the time it looked a great buy , if costly			0
yet it quickly became plain that @entity30 ’s problems lay elsewhere			0
@entity28 ? he ’s a brilliant , energetic , creative forward that any club would be lucky to have			0
but @entity30 , for the same fee as @entity4 ? is this their priority ? the jury is out			2
young star : @entity30 's @entity102 ( centre ) in action against @entity125 on sunday			1

@entity0 is capable of providing moments of individual genius that can decide the biggest games
the @entity131 is still a risk for @entity29 because of the tension his maverick presence can create
it is no coincidence that the @entity53 club 's best season was @entity4 's quietest off the field
@entity28 was as good as any player at @entity74 last season , even @entity76
but is it @entity30 's priority to sign the costly @entity148 star ?
