by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 12 september 2013 when @entity2 refused to cancel his dead son ’s phone contract , @entity1 was incensed			1
so he posted his exchange with its ‘ heartless ’ customer service team on @entity7 – and shamed the firm into an apology			0
@entity10 , 14 , had his blackberry with him when he fell to his death from a motorway bridge last month			2
@entity1 , seen with son @entity10 , branded @entity2 a heartless money - grabbing profiteering company but when his father asked @entity2 to cancel the monthly bills , it refused and said he would need to pay off the remainder of the contract – even suggesting he sold @entity10 ’s phone to recoup some of the cost			1
the 50 - year - old teacher was so furious that he posted the exchange on @entity7 under the heading : ‘ think maybe i ’ve been too polite			0
please feel free to repost / share			0
’ thousands passed on the email conversation – and @entity2 caved in within hours , cancelling the contract and issuing mr @entity1 a full apology			1
@entity10 , a hard - working student and talented musician , had just returned from an adventure holiday in @entity31 when he fell from a bridge over the @entity33 near his home in @entity35 on august 19			2
police have said there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death , and the matter has been passed to the coroner			0
@entity10 's father @entity42 was disgusted by the insensitive reaction of @entity2 , who refused to cancel his son 's contract mr @entity1 later contacted his local @entity2 shop asking for @entity10 ’s phone contract to be cancelled , but it refused as it had been taken out in @entity42 ’s name			1
in an email to the network ’s customer services team he complained : ‘ my son ’s sudden death has been traumatic enough without this experience			2
it simply is not good enough			0
’ he received an astonishing reply two days later from an employee who gave his name only as @entity59			0
he informed mr @entity10 : ‘ unfortunately , as the contract will be under your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement , it can not be cancelled			2
we really do appreciate the situation you are in and the very emotional time you must be going through , but we can only offer alternatives to your situation			0
’ he suggested ‘ buying out ’ of the agreement , which would have cost over £ 300 for a 12 - month contract based on @entity2 ’s basic @entity75 package			1
the email continued : ‘ whilst we can understand you may wish to keep your son ’s phone , you could sell the handset , to offset the fee			1
’ mr @entity1 explained that police had not yet returned @entity10 ’s handset , adding : ‘ maybe it is in good condition after such a fall , although i genuinely doubt it			1
would you like to make me an offer ? ’ he also pointed out that @entity2 ’s shop staff had advised that the contract be taken out in his name in the first place , due to @entity10 ’s young age			1
he suggested cuttingly : ‘ maybe you do this [ so ] in the eventuality of children dying it wo n’t affect your profits			0
’ @entity10 was a hard working student , who enjoyed being a member of the local @entity97 and a volunteer at the @entity99 @entity10 's father encountered trouble with @entity2 just days after his son 's funeral when he went to a phone shop to cancel the teenager 's contract @entity10 died after he was seen falling from a bridge on the @entity33 eastbound near to junction 20 mr @entity1 said yesterday : ‘ the situation has been resolved but this is still a very , very traumatic time for us			1
’ a spokesman for @entity2 – now part of the @entity114 network – said it had policies for cancelling deceased users ’ contracts and was investigating why these had n’t been followed			2
she added : ‘ we have been in contact with mr @entity1 to offer our sincerest apologies for any distress caused and can confirm that we have fully resolved this matter with him			1
’ mr @entity1 posted the emails to and from customers services on @entity7			1
here are some extracts from the exchange : my 14 - year - old son has recently died , and we buried him this week ... when we got his @entity75 last year , we were advised to add him onto my account as he was a minor ... but upon trying to cancel the shop is now telling me it ’s not possible and i am liable for the full term of the contract as it ’s in my name ! ! we have been passed from pillar to post on the phone			1
it simply is not good enough , and i await a fairly quick reply please			0
thank you , @entity1 we are extremely sorry to hear about your recent loss			2
unfortunately , as the contract will be under your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement , it can not be cancelled ... there is always the buying - out of the agreement , and whilst we can understand you may wish to keep your son ’s phone , you could sell the handset to offset the fee			1
kindest regards , @entity59 yes , the contract is under my name , as advised by @entity2			2
maybe you do this [ so ] in the eventuality of children dying it wo n’t affect your profits			0
i ’m sure my 14 year old son was n’t really thinking about the repercussions – we would have to deal with such a heartless , money - grabbing , profiteering company – as he threw himself off a motorway bridge to commit suicide ... now , selling the handset to offset the fee			1
maybe it is in good condition after such a fall , although i genuinely doubt it			0
would you like to make me an offer ? i suggest that you ask a senior manager to contact me			0
i would love to hear their side of the story			0
i await your immediate response			0
