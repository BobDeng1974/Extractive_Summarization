a woman has written a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways			1
sleep - deprived @entity7 based - actor , @entity6 , even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics			1
also a comedian , @entity14 used her humour in the two - page rant to get her rage across to the party - hard residents who live next door and cause her never - ending grief			1
@entity14 posted the letter on her blog with the precursor : ' so if you never hear from me again , i 've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours ' sound system			1
' please turn your funking music down so i can get some funking sleep , ' the letter opened with			1
she then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them ' all the funking time '			2
' last night , like many other nights , it was at 4.30am , a time of morning that should be reserved for breakfast radio hosts , international flight passengers , and parents of infants , ' she said			2
she signed off with her @entity73 handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left ' @entity6 said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but would n't have been heard over the revving of their friend 's engine of their ' sh * thouse fancy ute			1
' ' they were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty , that i am worried that the man behind the wheel was : ' a ) drink driving b ) not sure how to drive c ) brain damaged @entity97 ) actually a potato			2
' her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar ' over and funking over			2
' ' i 'm not sure if it 's you , or perhaps a friend , but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling ' derpa , derpa , derpa , derpa ' at the top of his lungs			0
is he okay ? ' she asked sarcastically			0
' i have genuine concern that this man is : a ) not sure how to human b ) brain damaged @entity117 ) actually a moron			0
' she also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the @entity124 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs @entity6 said she bought this card because ' @entity128 ' was not available in a large size the music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before @entity14 had to go out and begin her day			1
' everyone in my street probably feels the same			0
and the street behind us			0
and the deaf man in the next suburb			0
and anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away			0
' as the thoughtful neighbour , @entity6 gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with the apt songs : respect by @entity146 , ' @entity147 ' by @entity148 , ' all about the @entity149 ' by @entity150 , ' @entity151 ' by @entity152 and @entity153 ' by @entity154 ' because it 's just a funkin ' good song , really '			1
but she later revealed in the note that the @entity124 was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs			2
after suggesting to catch up over a @entity157 sometime , she asked them to ' grow up			0
' @entity6 also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time			1
the exhausted performer signed off with her @entity73 handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left '			0
