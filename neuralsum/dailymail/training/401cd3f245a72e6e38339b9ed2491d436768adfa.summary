by @entity0 published : 21:36 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 21:36 est , 30 november 2013 the campaign to tear @entity4 out of the @entity5 has failed to gain any ground despite the launch of the @entity9 ’s long - awaited prospectus for independence			1
an exclusive poll of more than 1100 @entity12 for @entity13 has revealed that only 27 per cent of voters plan to vote yes in next year ’s referendum , while 56 per cent intend to vote no and 17 per cent still do n’t know how they will vote			1
it means that support for @entity12 independence is still trailing far behind the @entity22 campaign – and remains at the same level as an identical @entity13 poll carried out in september			1
the poll was the first carried out since the @entity9 launched its ‘ white paper ’ on independence , which was supposed to provide details of every aspect of what an independent @entity4 would look like			1
setback : @entity33 's launch of the white paper on @entity12 independence does not seem to have boosted support for his cause as well as asking the main question that will appear on the referendum ballot paper – ' should @entity4 be an independent country ? ' - the poll also found that only 23 per cent of @entity12 think they would be better off if @entity4 went it alone			1
experts say that the findings reveal that the series of pledges unveiled by @entity4 ’s first minister @entity33 last tuesday have failed to have any impact on voters			0
it leaves the yes camp staring at defeat with less than one year to go until the vote			0
@entity9 leaders had described the launch of the @entity54 as a ‘ key moment ’ in the referendum campaign and were desperate to get a pick - up in the polls from the media blitz which followed the launch of the @entity54			0
opposition : the news will be welcome for @entity63 , leader of the pro-union ' better together ' campaign polling expert @entity66 , a research consultant at @entity67 , said : ‘ there can be little doubt that the yes side will be disappointed with this result because it does not show any evidence of any measurable swing of opinion			2
‘ opinion on this has proved to be so stable in the last 12 months			0
all the criticism of the no side has not gone anywhere so why should we be surprised a paper by the yes side makes no difference either ? ‘ the yes side may say the white paper will be a slow burner but , given the intensity of the media splash following the launch , they may have hoped it would make some difference			1
‘ one of the reasons there has been no immediate impact is it has not immediately persuaded people that people will be better off and this is crucial			0
’ the @entity13 ’s survey , carried out by respected pollsters @entity100 – the first firm to correctly predict the @entity9 majority victory in the 2011 @entity104 elections – is the first test of public opinion since the launch of the ‘ @entity109 ’ document , with 1134 @entity12 surveyed over the course of last wednesday and thursday			1
in an identical poll carried out by the same firm in september , 27 per cent of @entity12 intended to vote yes while 59 per cent intended to vote no and 14 per cent did not know how they would vote			1
despite an unprecedented push to attract female voters , who have traditionally been less supportive of independence than men , the poll shows that just 23 per cent of women intend to vote yes , while 56 per cent will vote no. the @entity9 had been hoping to secure an upturn in support from women after pledging to increase the amount of free childcare in an independent @entity4			1
there was also a huge difference in voting intentions depending on whether people work			0
incredibly , two – thirds of unemployed people intend to vote yes , compared to just one in four of full - time workers – a clear sign that lose who have most to lose are most fearful of separation			2
much of the @entity9 ’s campaign has focused on the @entity139 coalition ’s welfare shake - up			0
the poll also asked voters how independence would affect their own household financially – a crucial aspect of the referendum campaign since the @entity9 claim they will secure a yes vote if people think they will be £ 500 better off			1
it found that just 23 per cent of people think that their household would be better off if @entity4 became independent , while 49 per cent think they would be worse off and 13 per cent thought their finances would be the same – with the remainder not knowing how they would be affected			0
debate : @entity4 will go to the polls to decide its future on september 18 next year since last tuesday ’s launch , the @entity9 have come under fire for failing to provide a ‘ plan b ’ on currency if they fail to secure a pound - sharing currency union with the rest of the @entity5 following a yes vote , and for failing to accept the demands that other @entity169 countries may place on them in order to grant a separate @entity4 @entity169 membership			1
@entity63 , chairman of the @entity173 campaign , said : ‘ the @entity9 ’s manifesto for breaking up the @entity5 completely failed to pass even the basic tests			1
‘ they failed to offer a plan for what currency we would use if , as seems increasingly certain , the rest of the @entity5 say no to @entity4 keeping the pound , they failed to tell us anything about how much independence would cost us and their wish list of false promises lacked any sort of price list			1
‘ and their claims that we could leave the @entity5 without losing anything fell apart when the @entity194 prime minister said that leaving the @entity5 meant leaving the @entity169			2
‘ what was extraordinary was that the only new policy they announced was something that they could deliver now because childcare is already the responsibility of the @entity104 and the @entity9			0
‘ this poll confirms that @entity12 are choosing devolution in the @entity5 over separation from the @entity5			2
but we can not be complacent for one moment			0
’ @entity4 and @entity206 is the part of @entity4 with most support for the @entity209 , with 67 per cent of voters intending to vote no. surprisingly , another stronghold for the @entity173 campaign is @entity213 , where the @entity9 has been most successful in recent years , where 64 per cent intend to vote no and only 26 per cent intend to vote yes			2
support for the @entity209 increases with age , with 63 per cent of the over- 55s intending to vote no , compared to 42 per cent of 18 - 24 - year - olds			0
on the question of household finances , top earners were more likely to think they would be worse off in an independent @entity4 – which is a clear sign that voters fear savage tax rises – with 54 per cent of those in the @entity226 social grade thinking their household would be worse off in an independent @entity4 , compared to 45 per cent of people in the @entity226 social grades			0
@entity12 conservative leader @entity231 said : ‘ we take nothing for granted and continue the fight to keep our @entity5 together			2
‘ the majority of the @entity12 people have seen through the empty prospectus of the white paper and have recognised it is little more than an uncosted wishlist			1
‘ @entity4 is better off as part of one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the developed world , with a stable currency and a fully funded pensions system			0
‘ in stark contrast , the @entity9 ’s @entity54 featured just a single page on how a separate @entity4 would be paid for , which beggars belief			0
’ @entity250 , @entity251 's constitutional spokesman , said : ‘ the @entity9 promised the @entity54 would be a game changer but it would appear it has had no impact on the people of @entity4 who just do n't share the @entity9 's obsession with the constitution			2

only 27 *%* said they would vote for independence in @entity13 poll
more than half intend to vote to stay in @entity5 in fresh blow for ' yes ' campaign
public opinion does n't seem to have been swayed by this week 's white paper
