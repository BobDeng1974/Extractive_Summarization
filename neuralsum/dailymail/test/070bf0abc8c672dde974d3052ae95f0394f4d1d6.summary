@entity0 , the oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found , still has a few secrets to reveal			1
discovered in 1974 , the 3.2 million - year - old skeleton stunned archaeologists who unearthed the fossil while digging in an isolated spot in the @entity8 of @entity9			0
now , a new look at the ancient hominin 's skeleton suggests one of the bones may , in fact , belong to a baboon			2
@entity0 , the oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found , still has a few secrets to reveal			1
a new look at the ancient hominin 's skeleton suggests one of the vertebrae bones may belong to a baboon despite being uncovered 40 years ago , @entity0 is still being studied to learn more about our ancestors			1
the skeleton belongs to a species called @entity28 and is around 40 per cent complete			0
when discovered in @entity9 , @entity0 was the only skeleton of the species known ; she would 've stood 3.5 feet ( about a meter ) tall			0
currently , more than 300 individuals of this species , which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago , have been uncovered the strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when @entity37 and @entity38 at the @entity39 in @entity40 began work on a reconstruction of @entity0 's skeleton ( right ) the strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when @entity37 and @entity38 at the @entity39 in @entity40 began work on a reconstruction of @entity0 's skeleton			1
' @entity38 pointed out that one of the [ vertebra ] fragments , which no one , including me , had really paid close attention to , looked fairly small to fit with the rest of @entity0 's vertebral column , ' @entity47 at @entity48 told the @entity56			1
the researchers thought one possible explanation was that the fragment was missed up with another , younger member of @entity0 's species			1
a comparative study of vertebrae from other @entity66 fossils in that region disproved this theory			0
the researchers analysed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete @entity72 fossil skeleton from @entity73 to gauge its age scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating technique shows that @entity72 , an important fossil of an early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in @entity80 , is roughly 3.7 million years old			1
' the age of @entity72 has been highly debated , ' said geologist @entity82 of @entity83 in @entity84 , whose research appears in the journal @entity87			0
the study found @entity72 , a member of the species @entity90 , lived at roughly the same time as @entity28 , the species whose most famous fossil , known as @entity0 , comes from @entity9			2
both species blended ape - like and human - like traits but with different features			0
the researchers analysed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete @entity72 fossil skeleton from the @entity99 to gauge its age			2
the findings may have important implications about the evolutionary relationships among humankind 's ancient relatives			0
the team then compared it to the vertebrae of other creatures living in that region 3.2 million years ago , and found a baboon bone was the closest fit			1
@entity47 told @entity56 that the fossil of a gelada baboon thoracic vertebra must have somehow been mixed up with @entity0 's remains			1
the team now plan to present their findings at the @entity118 in @entity119 next week			0
our species , @entity120 , appeared roughly 200,000 years ago			0
earlier members of the human genus , @entity125 , date back more than 2 million years			0
our genus was predated by other species on the human family tree including various representatives of @entity0 's genus @entity66			1
dr @entity132 , principal lecturer in anthropology at @entity134 , said : ' the co-mingling of skeletons is quite common in the archaeological record and it can often be difficult to separate out different elements if multiple bodies are mixed together			0
' @entity0 was not found in association with lots of other different bones and was painstakingly studied during excavation and description			2
mistakes can of course be made with 1000s of fragments but that was nâ€™t the case here			0
' even if one fragment of a bone from the spine turns out to be from a baboon it does not alter the larger picture of what @entity0 brings to the story of human evolution			1
' our genus was predated by other species on the human family tree including various representatives of the genus @entity66 , of which @entity0 ( reconstruction pictured ) belonged to			2

baboon bone was spotted by the @entity39
researchers thought one of the vertebra bones was too small to fit @entity0
they say the baboon bone was somehow mixed up with @entity0 's remains
@entity0 is oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found
