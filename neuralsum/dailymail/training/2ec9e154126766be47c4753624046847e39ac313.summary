by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 5 november 2013 the @entity1 chief in @entity2 says agents can continue using deadly force against rock - throwers , despite the recommendation of a government - commissioned review to end the practice			1
the @entity10 , a nonprofit group that advises law enforcement agencies , recommended that the @entity1 and its parent agency , @entity12 , stop the use of deadly force against rock throwers and assailants in vehicles , @entity1 chief @entity1 said			1
both recommendations were part of a broader internal review of @entity12 's use - of - force policies and practices that began last year			1
@entity23 border patrol agents examine the area near where 14 - year - old @entity26 youth @entity25 was killed , allegedly shot by a @entity23 @entity1 agent , in 2010 the measures were not included in a revised policy announced on sept. 25 that calls for more training and better record - keeping			1
@entity12 considered the proposed curbs ' very restrictive ' , @entity1 told @entity0			2
under current policy , agents can use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that their lives or the lives of others are in danger			1
' we should n't have carve - outs in our policy and say , except for this , except for that , ' @entity1 said			0
' just to say that you should n't shoot at rock - throwers or vehicles for us , in our environment , was very problematic and could potentially put @entity1 agents in danger			1
' @entity12 has not released the full findings of the @entity10			2
@entity1 's comments are the most publicly detailed about them			0
@entity23 border patrol vehicle drives along the @entity23 - @entity26 border fence near @entity57 , @entity58 the internal review began last year after 16 members of @entity61 raised concern about the may 2010 killing of @entity64 , an unarmed @entity26 who died from stun gun wounds at @entity2 's @entity68 port of entry			1
authorities have said he was being combative while being returned to @entity26			0
the @entity71 is investigating that killing			0
@entity64 was one of 20 people killed by @entity12 officials since 2010 , including eight who died in rock - throwing incidents with @entity1 agents , according to the @entity77			1
@entity1 repeated the agency 's long - standing position that rocks are lethal weapons			1
smugglers have long pelted agents with rocks , bottles and other objects — often from @entity26 — hoping to create an opening elsewhere along the border when agents rush to assist colleagues being pelted			2
agents were attacked with rocks 339 times in the 2011 fiscal year , more than any other type of assault , according to the @entity97 inspector general			1
they responded with gunfire 33 times and with less - than - lethal force — a category that includes pepper spray and batons — 118 times			0
migrants look at a @entity23 @entity1 car from the @entity26 side of the @entity23 - @entity26 border in @entity109 , @entity26 rock attacks fell to 185 in the 2012 fiscal year , the second most common type of assault			1
agents fired a gun 22 times and responded 42 times with less - than - lethal force			1
the proposed ban on firing at vehicles would have brought the @entity1 in line with some metropolitan police departments , @entity1 said			0
but he pointed out that the federal agency operates in much different terrain			0
' you do n't want to just start shooting indiscriminately at a vehicle and try to blow out tires like they do on tv , but our environment is totally different , ' @entity1 said			0
' in many cases , unlike a concrete jungle , you have a very narrow trail and the @entity1 agent does n't always have the ability to get out of the way			0
' activists were disappointed that @entity12 rejected the recommendations			0
' we 've long held that deadly force should be limited to the most exceptional circumstances , ' said @entity141 , executive director of @entity142 , who attended a meeting with @entity146 administration officials at the @entity147 in september that covered the topic			2
' @entity1 has yet to demonstrate that that 's the appropriate level of force in the cases that have happened , ' @entity141 said			2
@entity151 , spokesman for the @entity152 , the union representing @entity1 officers , welcomed the agency 's position			0
' almost every @entity1 agent has been rocked at one point or another , ' @entity151 said			0
' i know agents here that have had vehicles accelerate toward them , attempt to run them down			0
' @entity1 rejected any suggestion that @entity1 agents were trigger - happy			2
' when you look at that environment , that workspace , i think our agents show a great deal of restraint when it comes to use of deadly force , ' he said .			2
