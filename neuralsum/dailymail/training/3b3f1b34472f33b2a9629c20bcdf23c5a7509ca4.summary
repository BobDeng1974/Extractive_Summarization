by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 7 november 2013 hero : @entity2 single - handedly destroyed a @entity3 and was awarded a vc but was left off a commemorative list because he was born in @entity6 a first world war flying hero is to be honoured in his hometown - after a @entity9			1
@entity11 chiefs had banned @entity12 sub lieutenant @entity2 from having his name immortalised with an honour plaque because he was born in @entity6			1
@entity15 was awarded the @entity16 aged just 23 when he became the first person to destroy a @entity3 airship planning to bomb @entity19			1
over @entity20 in 1915 he hit the @entity22 airship @entity23 - 37 with a bomb sending it down in flames			2
it was expected that his name would lie alongside that of fellow @entity4 hero submariner lt @entity29 in their home town of @entity32 in east @entity33			1
the stones are part of a @entity37 plan to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of @entity40 by laying plaques in the birthplaces of @entity4 heroes			2
but then they ruled that only those born in @entity46 would be honoured and @entity15 was born in @entity6 and did not move to @entity32 until he was thirteen years old			1
there was an outcry over the exclusion of @entity15 and other foreign - born @entity4 winners			1
but now communities minister @entity51 said : ' there are a number of @entity4 recipients who may have been born in @entity6 like sub lt @entity2 that have local ties			1
' in cases like this we are happy to provide ( @entity61 ) with a commemorative paving stone			2
' @entity15 ’s nephew @entity63 said : ' we are delighted the government has changed its mind			2
@entity32 was the only home @entity15 knew			1
' the government plans to commemorate every @entity46 - born @entity4 winner			1
@entity15 's hometown honours his memory ( right ) - now the @entity37 is set to do the same plans are now being made to unveil the tribute stones in the town ’s @entity72 in the spring			2
@entity74 , archivist for the @entity75 where @entity15 's @entity4 is held , said eastern @entity76 had ' lived in fear ' of the devastating zeppelin bombing raids			2
' overnight , @entity2 became a national hero and gave us hope , ' said mrs @entity74			0
' killed in a crash only two weeks later , his death led to national mourning			0
' some 99 years on , it is fitting that we should remember him			0
' an artist 's impression of the daring @entity3 raid which was celebrated nationally and earned @entity90 the @entity16 and @entity92 's @entity91 sub-lt @entity2 was born on october 15 , 1891 , in @entity94 in the foothills of the @entity96 , where his parents served in the colonial service at the height of the @entity100			1
he had completed a dozen solo flights when on june 7 , 1915 , he was ordered to join a four - plane midnight attack on the @entity3 sheds at @entity104 in occupied @entity20			1
sub lt @entity2 had never flown in the dark before and quickly lost his fellow pilots			0
flying a tiny single - seater @entity107 , mostly made from just wood and canvas , he came across airship @entity111 airship cruising at 7,000ft			0
the massive bomber was kept airborne by 953,000 cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen			0
@entity15 was armed with just a revolver , a carbine , and six 20 - pound bombs			0
he spotted the airship at @entity119 and he followed it for 50 minutes over @entity120 before @entity2 shot at it			0
after the @entity3 dropped to 7,000ft , @entity2 was able to climb above it and dropped his bombs , which ripped the airship apart			1
@entity2 's plane was enveloped in flames and he crash - landed 35 miles behind @entity22 lines			0
he found only his fuel line was broken and fixed the problem with a cigarette holder before coolly flying home			0
by the time he returned to base at 10.30am the next day , his exploits were being celebrated across the empire			0
@entity134 awarded @entity15 the @entity16 that day , while @entity92 followed up with its prestigious @entity91			0
he won worldwide fame for becoming the first pilot to shoot down a feared zeppelin			2
but he was killed 10 days later after he returned from @entity92 after collecting the award in a new biplane that bucked moments after take - off and the pilot was thrown out and killed .			0

@entity144 ' @entity143 lived in @entity32 but was born in @entity6
he was *denied* a plaque in the east @entity33 town because of his foreign birth
but now officials have *decided* he will be honoured for his brave *actions*
the destruction of the feared @entity3 *captured* the public *imagination*
