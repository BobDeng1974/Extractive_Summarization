during an interview with @entity2 to be shown this week , @entity0 announces that his best position is striker			1
' i can have my greatest impact there , ' he claims			1
' i 'm free to roam around , take players on , have shots and create chances			0
' this season , the year when people were convinced @entity0 would come of age in the colours of @entity15 , he has scored twice and created just two more			1
little wonder he accepts he has had a dip in form			0
@entity0 ( right ) gets away from @entity21 's @entity20 during @entity23 's 1 - 1 draw in @entity24 the @entity15 midfielder loses the ball after a challenge from @entity21 defender @entity28 @entity0 replaced @entity29 in the second half and looked bright as the @entity23 earned a draw the problem with @entity0 , who showed flashes of his talent after coming on as a 55th - minute substitute during @entity23 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity21 in @entity24 , is that nobody is quite sure what his best position is			1
ask everybody involved with him at @entity15 or with @entity23 and they will come up with a different answer			1
this season alone he has played in five different roles ( six if his appearances as a substitute are included ) for @entity15 : 10 in his favoured role off the main forward , six starts on the left , once in front of the back four , once in the centre of midfield and one start at right wing			1
at 21 there has to be an element of confusion , struggling to work out why his manager @entity59 is playing him in so many different positions at @entity62			1
@entity0 came off the bench as @entity23 beat @entity64 on friday to stay on course for @entity66 the 21 - year - old replaced midfielder @entity67 for the last 20 minutes at @entity68 for some players this would be an education , an opportunity to experience the game from different areas of the pitch as they continue their development			2
with @entity0 , it feels very different			2
he has had such a billing since he first broke in to the @entity15 them , with comparisons to the late , great @entity81 , to the mercurial talents of @entity83 over recent times , that his name creates mild hysteria whenever it is mentioned			2
it seems particularly unfair to compare him with @entity81 , a man who controlled the tempo of matches when he was playing for @entity15 , @entity90 and @entity23			2
he was also , notably , a @entity92 winner			0
it should also be remembered that @entity83 , who had a far better goalscoring record at @entity95 , had to wait until he was 21 to make his @entity23 debut , against @entity97 in 1988			0
@entity0 has serious potential , something @entity98 and his coaching staff recognise with his regular appearances in the @entity23 squad			2
they , too , are baffled by @entity0 's failure to hold down a regular , fixed position with his club because he is attentive and willing to learn during @entity23 's training sessions			2
@entity0 has been compared with @entity81 - pictured on the left celebrating @entity23 's 1966 @entity92 win @entity111 - an @entity23 hero at the @entity112 - is another former star @entity0 has been likened to 2011 - 12 appearances 9 goals 0 2012 - 13 appearances 0 goals 0 @entity117 ( loan ) appearances 13 goals 4 @entity120 ( loan ) appearances 4 goals 0 2013 - 14 appearances 38 goals 7 2014 - 15 appearances 28 goals 2 @entity0 made his @entity23 debut in 2013 - he has 12 caps and no goals			1
there is a theory that @entity0 , who began his career as central defender , would be better making those surging runs from deeper position			2
the problem is convincing @entity0 to commit to the idea			0
in @entity138 last summer , after @entity23 had drawn a tune - up game 2 - 2 with @entity140 , he was encouraged by @entity98 to keep the ball , to be more intuitive and use it more wisely			0
there is a similar issue with @entity15 's central defender @entity145 : he has outstanding attributes , but he is caught in possession , in dangerous areas of the pitch , too often			0
this is an area @entity23 's coaching staff have addressed with @entity0 , showing him the hotspots when a careless ball or misplaced pass at the highest level can end in the back of @entity158 's net			0
against @entity159 last november , when @entity98 placed enormous pressure on himself to secure a result at @entity162 against an old rival , he was caught screaming expletives at @entity0 after he came on as a substitute			0
there is certainly an element of frustration building up around this young player because has yet to convert his obvious talent into the complete , all round , match - winning performance			0
@entity0 featured against @entity159 last year but was on the receiving end of a @entity98 blast at @entity162 like @entity0 , @entity15 's @entity145 ( left ) can also get caught in possession in dangerous areas of the pitch there is certainly a demand for more goals , something he aspired to with those two shots that hit the woodwork during @entity15 's damaging 5 - 2 defeat by @entity183 in the @entity184			1
last summer , when @entity0 was in @entity138 preparing for the @entity92 with @entity23 , @entity59 told @entity185 that his young midfielder needed room to breathe			1
' we have to allow him to develop and let 's not put too much pressure on him			0
at the moment he is perfectly suited to playing in the no 10 role , but in time he will develop into the complete midfielder			0
' at the moment he is a substitute for @entity23 , watching the games from the bench and listening to the advice of captain @entity198 after the game with @entity64 on friday			0
@entity198 has taken a pastoral role in @entity0 's welfare , offering him advice when he was named among @entity23 's substitutes for the 4 - 0 victory over @entity64 at @entity68 last friday			1
@entity0 accepts that his form has dipped , well aware that he has yet to mature in to a role that suits club and country			1
when he settles on a preferred position , @entity0 will be the biggest beneficiary			0
@entity0 , keeping an eye on @entity211 playmaker @entity210 , was expected to shine this season the midfielder , pictured trying his luck against @entity214 , has just two goals this season one of his goals came in the 3 - 0 win over @entity95 at @entity62 in the middle of march			1

@entity0 has just two goals and two **assists** this season for @entity15
this was the season @entity0 was expected to come of age
but he has just two goals and two **assists** for the campaign with @entity15
he says his favourite role is striker where can have the ' greatest impact '
