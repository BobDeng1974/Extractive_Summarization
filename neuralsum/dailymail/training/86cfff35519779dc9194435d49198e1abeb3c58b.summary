by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 outside @entity4 ’s @entity3 , @entity2 has been engulfed by scarves and shirts			2
on his head , someone has placed a golden crown and the bronze figure , frozen mid-shot , has been encased in protective glass			2
@entity2 died in january and @entity13 mourned , but today in @entity16 , the @entity15 final feels as if it might have been designed as the coronation of his natural heir			1
‘ @entity21 reminds me of @entity2 , ’ said none other than @entity20			1
‘ he has the elegance and creativity of the great players			2
he has been voted the world ’s best player , broken the record for goals scored in a single @entity15 campaign and set a record for @entity13 with 49 goals			1
this final is momentous — and mouth - watering — for many special reasons			2
it is the first city derby in a @entity15 final , @entity36 are close to @entity62 and yet standing before them are the unfashionable neighbours , led by @entity65			1
@entity66 are trying to win this trophy for the first time , having just won their first @entity70 title for 18 years			2
@entity66 midfielder @entity71 hailed @entity65 as a ‘ god ’			0
‘ he arrived and changed everything , ’ said @entity71 , one of four @entity74 likely to play in the final			1
‘ we follow him ; if he asks us to jump from the bridge , we jump			0
’ there is @entity79 seeking his third @entity81 title as coach , in charge of a third different club , with his @entity86 backroom , and there is @entity88 , the world ’s most expensive footballer stepping into this showpiece nine months after leaving @entity91			2
in tears : @entity21 cries as @entity13 lose to @entity93 in the @entity95 final home comforts : @entity21 hopes to triumph in @entity16 there is @entity99 goalkeeper @entity98 and the centre forward they want to buy , @entity102 , although he is doubtful with a hamstring injury			1
sub-plots are everywhere and yet all eyes are on @entity21 as he swaggers back to the city where he played for @entity31 , scoring five goals in 30 games before being lured to @entity109			1
‘ it is going to be a very special game , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ i am playing in my country , in my first final with @entity36			1
i ’m very happy , very excited			0
it is a legendary stadium for everyone in @entity74 and for me			1
it has been a great period			0
‘ the fans realise that			2
they know we are close to achieving greatness			0
because of that , they are more enthusiastic			0
as players , we have to do our bit by winning games and they support us home and away			0
‘ there is a feeling of joy , of passion , expectation			0
the players feel we are very close to achieving something very special in football history , in @entity36 history , in the history of all the players			1
we are one step away			0
’ local support is firmly behind him			0
as he trained in the stadium last night , the young dancers waiting beneath the stands to rehearse for the pre-match show could be heard singing his name long and loud			0
it was a few miles around the ring road , at the opening of @entity31 ’s brand - new @entity148 in 2003 , where the teenage winger from @entity150 led @entity109 ’s defence a merry dance			0
centre of attention : @entity21 talks to the media ahead of the final starting out : @entity21 began his career at @entity31 it ’s the toughest and most exclusive double in world football — winning the @entity15 and @entity160 in the same year			1
since 1992 , when the @entity15 changed to its current format , only two players have managed it			1
@entity164 ( @entity36 and @entity165 , 1998 ) and @entity166 ( @entity36 and @entity167 , 2002 ) are the pair who made history , but others can take the first step to joining them when real face @entity66 on saturday			1
@entity36 ’s @entity174 has an excellent chance as he will hope to start at left back for hosts @entity167			1
@entity177 was key to @entity36 ’s run to the final and should feature for @entity180 this summer			1
@entity66 stars @entity102 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 could play a part for holders @entity186			0
everyone present that night suspected they had seen something special and the @entity74 press were keen to ask sir @entity191 who he liked most from this @entity31 team			1
@entity191 mumbled that he had always admired veteran striker @entity194 and a few days later spent £ 12.8million on @entity21			1
he has won the @entity197 and plundered 16 @entity15 goals			1
‘ we need him , ’ said boss @entity79			0
‘ he is a very important weapon			0
his statistics are there for all to see			0
’ he passed @entity203 as @entity36 ’s leading @entity81 scorer in the quarter - finals and , with 66 @entity15 goals , is only five behind the competition ’s top scorer @entity207			1
when he fired in no 15 for the season , he performed a special ‘ 15 ’ celebration with @entity88 , which made you wonder if his true inspiration is personal glory or @entity36 ’s long pursuit of a 10th @entity81 crown			1
‘ it ’s a special record , ’ said @entity21 , who is expected to be fit			1
‘ that ’s why i celebrated like that			0
not only on an individual level but also on a collective level			0
@entity36 have proved they are an excellent team who deserve to win this trophy			1
‘ on an individual level , it has gone well			0
i ’ve scored the most goals in this tournament			2
so i ’m happy about that			0
‘ i ’ve evolved a little every year			2
a footballer always needs to progress			0
there are always things to improve			0
‘ equalling or beating @entity203 ’s record gives me real pride			2
i admire him as a person			0
i have seen videos of him playing			2
but records are there to be broken			2
generation after generation , things have to change			0
‘ i ’m very happy to become part of @entity36 ’s history			1
i will try to win this as much as i can for this club , because this is certainly the club i like the most			0
