@entity0 had chosen the ambitious mission that will visit a comet and pluck a boulder from its surface to create an orbiting base for astronauts			1
a robot ship will pluck a large boulder off an asteroid and sling it around the moon , becoming a destination to prepare for future human missions to @entity17 , the @entity8 space agency has revealed			1
the so - called @entity18 is estimated to cost about $ 1.25 billion not including launch costs and is targeted for liftoff in december 2020			0
it would be followed five years later by a human expedition to the space rock , a modification of a plan proposed by president @entity25 in 2010			0
after extensive studies , @entity0 opted to collect and move a boulder , a mission that will cost about $ 100 million more , but which better prepares the agency for the ultimate goal of landing astronauts on @entity17			1
' they 're the kind of things that we know we 're going to need when we go to another planetary body , ' nasa associate administrator @entity48 told reporters on a conference call			0
@entity0 plans to study the asteroid for about a year and test deflection techniques that one day may be necessary to save @entity54 from a potentially catastrophic collision			1
an asteroid or comet smashed into the planet about 65 million years ago , leading to climate changes that killed off dinosaurs and most other life on @entity54 then			0
so far , @entity0 has three candidate asteroids , but does not expect to make a decision about where to fly before 2019			2
the mission involves flying a robotic spacecraft , powered by solar electric propulsion , to an asteroid for an extensive survey			1
once a target boulder was selected , the probe would hover down toward the surface and deploy a pair of robot arms to grab hold of a 6.5 - to 13 - foot ( 2 - to 4 meter ) wide boulder			2
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity82			1
after the @entity82 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			1
once the @entity82 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			1
after the mission is complete , @entity82 returns to @entity54 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the @entity104 days later			1
the mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to @entity17 and returning them safely			1
' i 'm going to have multiple targets ... we can assess which one we want to go after and i then have three - to five tries to get it , or i can move on to a different one , ' @entity48 said			0
the captured boulder , which would remain attached to the probe , would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around the moon , a maneuver expected to take about six years			0
the probe would include a docking ring so a @entity82 spaceship , carrying two astronauts , could reach the asteroid , a mission targeted for around 2025			1
@entity0 's ultimate goal is to send humans to @entity17 , and they say the @entity18 ( @entity126 ) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there			1
a number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission , which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it			2
astronauts aboard @entity0 's @entity82 spacecraft , launched from the upcoming @entity141 ( @entity141 ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon @entity0 plans to launch an @entity126 robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade			1
the spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a ' @entity155 ' - one that orbits the moon very widely , coming quite close before extending out much further away			0
astronauts aboard @entity0 's @entity82 spacecraft , launched from the upcoming @entity141 ( @entity141 ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon			1
within the papers , authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions			0
this includes advanced @entity167 ( @entity167 ) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the @entity17 system			1
@entity167 - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays , which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms ( ions )			0
this is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry , which can be heavy and expensive to launch from @entity54			0
an asteroid named @entity183 photographed by the @entity185 probe			0
the agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019 , approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft			1
before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission , scientists must first determine its characteristics , in addition to size , such as rotation , shape and precise orbit			2
@entity0 has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far : @entity202 , @entity203 and 2008 @entity204			2
the agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission			0
returning asteroid samples will help @entity0 develop tools and techniques for future space exploration			1
this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space			0
rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel			0
there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future			0
with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on @entity54 or in space			0
current studies at @entity0 detailed in the papers are examining ways @entity167 will be used to power the arm robotic mission			2
@entity0 was also working on a mission concept that would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms			1
the @entity126 crewed mission , in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon , provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well			1
the papers detail current work underway at @entity0 to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from @entity54 than ever before			2
concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and uncrewed spacecraft together are also in development			0
this will allow the crew aboard @entity82 to attach to the @entity126 robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid			1
this could be later used to connect @entity82 with a deep space habitat or ' stepping stone ' on its way to @entity17 , or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit			1
astronauts returning home with samples from @entity17 will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about @entity17 and the solar system 's history			1
various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on @entity126 to enable planetary defense capabilities			0
these techniques include @entity295 , @entity296 , and kinetic impactors			0
in @entity295 , the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area			0
a thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid			2
the @entity295 approach is independent of the size of the asteroid , and it could be demonstrated on either mission option			2
in the @entity296 approach , the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid 's surface as in mission option @entity318 the spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid 's velocity vector			1
the mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid			2
by flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid 's trajectory			2
a kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle , and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact			2
as well as this , returning asteroid samples will help @entity0 develop tools and techniques for future space exploration			1
this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space			0
rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel			0
there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future			0
with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on @entity54 or in space .			0
