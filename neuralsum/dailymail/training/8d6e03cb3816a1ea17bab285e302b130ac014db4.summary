after the travel chaos which preceded the game perhaps @entity2 can be forgiven for the erratic hand gestures at the back - post			1
was he hailing a cab ? or stopping a routemaster ? @entity8 were 18 minutes from a clean sheet in the first leg of this @entity12 semi-final , when @entity2 challenged @entity13 for a deep cross			1
first his right - hand went up in a hopeful appeal for offside and then his left hand swung through the line of the ball , clearing it somewhere into the crowd			0
@entity24 jumps for joy after scoring from the penalty spot to give @entity27 a first - leg lead over @entity8 @entity2 handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give @entity27 a penalty @entity24 stepped up to the spot and coolly converted to put @entity27 ahead with just over 15 minutes to play @entity27 : @entity32 6 , @entity33 6 , @entity34 6.5 , @entity35 6 , @entity36 5 , @entity37 7 ( @entity38 75 ) , @entity39 5.5 ( @entity40 65 , 6 ) , @entity41 8 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 5 ( @entity13 65 , 6 )			1

ratings by @entity73 helped by his assistant , referee @entity70 awarded the penalty and @entity24 stepped forward to smash @entity27 into the lead with a confident strike and give them a glimpse of @entity80			1
that was all that separated the @entity84 team from their @entity86 hosts			0
overall , @entity27 were probably worth the narrow victory having dominated the game while rarely troubling @entity8 goalkeeper @entity52 , but this tie is not over			1
@entity91 ’s side proved that they are not short on belief			0
the game ended with them on the attack in search of an equaliser , and they coped well with pre-match problems which saw the game delayed because @entity8 ’s team - bus was stuck on the congested streets of north @entity101			0
travel issues aside , the @entity103 team must have made their way to @entity106 in confident mood , having reached the semi-finals of last season ’s @entity109 and beaten @entity111 and @entity112 on the road to the same stage of this competition			0
they have not reached a major final since 1936 , and @entity118 has acquired a giant - killing knack			0
there was no inferiority complex as they opened at a strong tempo , hustling @entity27 , refusing to let them settle			1
in midfield they snapped into tackles and spreading the ball wide and goalkeeper @entity52 launched it forward with great gusto when given the chance			0
@entity61 enjoyed early flickers of success against @entity33 , @entity27 ’s former @entity8 defender , as the 4,000 visiting fans sang : ' @entity33 , he wants us to win '			1
@entity56 lashed one effort over in the chaos of the first 10 minutes , before the @entity86 side were able to impose any degree of control			0
@entity27 striker @entity44 , who was jeered by fans , tries to evade the challenge from @entity8 's @entity56 @entity142 turns away from pressure from @entity8 's @entity2 even then , it was unconvincing			1
@entity44 , starting for the first time since early november , was unable to link up and allowed his frustrations to boil over when he flung an arm at @entity57 a few yards from the @entity8 bench			2
@entity91 and his coaching staff reacted angrily			0
they were certain an elbow had been thrown with intent as @entity57 crashed to the deck			0
there was certainly heavy contact , although it was @entity44 ’s left hand which caught the 17 - year - old around the jawline , rather than his elbow			2
still , it was a hand in the face and @entity161 must have been relieved when @entity70 pulled out a yellow card rather than a red one			0
@entity27 defender @entity33 and @entity8 's @entity59 both leap to try and win a header @entity42 holds off @entity59 as he attempts a run at @entity8 's defence during the first leg of the semi-final tie @entity27 captain @entity44 talks to @entity33 during the first leg of the last - four contest at @entity106 many @entity27 supporters were surprised to see @entity44 made captain for the night , given that he has played just 32 minutes of football since november , his future at @entity106 is in doubt and he looked largely uninterested against @entity177 at the weekend			1
this time he managed to avoid being booed by his own fans at the start , but was seriously off the pace and ineffectual			0
in the absence of @entity183 and with @entity47 on the bench , the @entity27 boss had taken the strange decision to make @entity44 his captain for the night			1
just four days earlier , some @entity27 fans had booed the @entity189 striker as he came on as a substitute , unhappy with the application of their £ 100,000 - a - week top - earner this season			1
his reception was warmer on wednesday , but supporters cheered the change when he was replaced by @entity197 through the second half			2
they prefer the fella who can not score but clearly tries , and especially if he helps them over the line by winning a penalty			0
it would have been far worse had @entity44 been dismissed for his careless challenge on @entity57 , who accepted an apologetic handshake before the game went on			2
@entity44 is shown a yellow card in the first half ( left ) before being substituted in the 65th minute ( right ) @entity44 cut a frustrated figure on a cold evening at @entity106 , and he was jeered by supporters when substituted @entity44 's evening came to an end after 65 minutes when he was substituted by @entity13 to boos from the home fans , which seemed to make @entity91 chuckle @entity91 was still demanding answers from fourth official @entity218 as @entity219 burst inside from the right and zipped a low cross-shot close but the brief interruption energised the home team			1
with @entity225 boss @entity224 in the crowd , @entity24 became more influential , running at left - back @entity55 , although his delivery was as haphazard as ever			2
on the other flank , @entity42 found it difficult to get into the game for the first half - hour , although he was more effective when he drifted inside as the game went on			2
@entity34 was the first to test @entity8 ’s ‘ keeper @entity52 , with a powerful header from a free - kick swung in from the right by @entity24			2
@entity34 ’s contact was strong but he could not direct the ball well and @entity52 was able to push the effort aside			0
@entity43 ’s long ball over the top was collected by @entity44 with a decent first touch but he screwed a volley well wide under pressure from @entity2			1
@entity34 went close with a glancing header , again from an in - swinging @entity24 free - kick , this time inches wide			2
but @entity59 fired a warning @entity27 ’s way when @entity36 was dispossessed by @entity57 deep in his own territory			2
@entity59 ’s effort from the edge of the penalty area was narrowly off target			1
spurs dominated possession and forced @entity8 back as the second half went on , but @entity91 ’s defensive unit were organised and committed even if they did start to show signs of tiring			0
@entity13 came on for @entity44 , and he forced @entity8 defender @entity2 into a mistake that won @entity27 a penalty @entity24 fired the ball home past the despairing dive of @entity8 goalkeeper @entity52 in the 74th minute @entity24 shields the ball from @entity262 as the @entity8 man looks to apply the pressure to the winger @entity27 defender @entity33 holds off a challenge from @entity8 's @entity61 as he looks to start an attack for his team @entity225 manager @entity224 was in the stands for the match along with @entity27 chairman @entity272 @entity8 manager @entity91 and @entity27 boss @entity161 have a chat on the touchline all four of @entity24 ’s goals for @entity27 this season have been penalties — two in the @entity279 , one in the @entity12 and one in the @entity86 @entity2 was booked for a mistimed slide on @entity41 and some panic set in but optimism was rising among the noisy @entity8 fans			1
they had seen another performance to belie the club ’s third tier existence and their remains the possibility of another trip to @entity80 and their first major final since 1936			1
@entity291 ’s adventure two years ago has given hope to all lower league teams in this position , but @entity27 have the edge thanks to @entity2 ’s hand signals and @entity24 ’s penalty .			1

@entity24 scored from the penalty spot in the second half for @entity27
@entity24 converted after @entity2 handled the ball inside his own penalty area
@entity44 jeered by home fans when he was substituted in the second half
second leg of semi-final clash takes place at @entity311 next wednesday
