@entity1 boss @entity0 has criticised @entity4 's ' crazy ' @entity3 schedule , claiming the traditional fixture pile - up only favours the biggest clubs			1
the @entity1 , who are second in the @entity8 , face @entity9 on monday ahead of a testing month that brings games against @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity0 's side also have to play four games in nine days over @entity3 including league fixtures on @entity20 and @entity21 before the @entity23 third round on the first weekend in january			1
' i always used to be on holiday during @entity3 and now we have a lot of games to prepare for			0
' i told the players , " honestly , i do n't have that experience " , it 's difficult			0
' we have to play december 26 and then again on the 28th , january 1 and then january 3 for the @entity23 - it 's crazy			1
' it 's not crazy to play at @entity3 because i understand - we had that in @entity45 and the people like that			2
' i 'd like that as well if i like football and support @entity1 - i can have my @entity3 meal then go to the stadium and watch @entity1 , i am happy			2
@entity1 have only started 15 different players in the @entity8 this season @entity0 took over from @entity53 in the summer and @entity1 have been a revelation ' the problem is you have one day off between two games and that 's crazy , that 's impossible			1
' that 's my problem with the schedule because if it 's the 26th and the 29th , no problem , but it 's friday and sunday			0
that 's crazy , one day off , crazy			0
' @entity1 have reaped the benefits of @entity0 's consistent selection policy this season			1
the @entity1 have started less players ( 15 ) in the league so far than top four rivals @entity13 ( 18 ) , @entity71 ( 21 ) , @entity72 ( 21 ) and @entity14 ( 22 )			1
@entity0 believes the fixture congestion at @entity3 plays into the hands of those teams with bigger squads at their disposal			1
' does it favour the big clubs ? yes			0
they can change players much easier than other teams in the @entity8 , ' @entity0 said			2
' it is worst for the clubs who have n't got 24 players at the same level			0
@entity0 believes the smaller squads are at a disadvantage over a hectic festive period ' you have to change your team and i do n't like to change my team			1
i believe if the team is doing well you can change one or two positions but i do n't believe in changing my team in six or seven positions			0
' if @entity1 want to keep pace with the sides at the top of the table , they may need to bolster their options in the january transfer window			2
' our transfer policy in january does n't depend on winning and losing over the next month , ' @entity0 said			2
' it depends on the players we have - for example we know that @entity111 has to play at the @entity112 , @entity107 will play in the @entity113 but we do n't need a lot of players			0
' i am happy with the players we have			0
it depends on injuries if you need someone but it 's too early to make conclusions about that			0

@entity0 labels festive fixture pile - up ' crazy '
@entity1 play four games in nine days in december and january
@entity1 boss says it favours clubs with bigger squads
@entity1 have only started 15 players in the league this season
