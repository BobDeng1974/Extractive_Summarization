the @entity0 was closed down in 2007			1
its founder and operator , @entity3 , could no longer establish work visas for his many international performers - mostly from @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 - following legislative changes , and was forced to stop the tour he had done for almost 10 years			1
however the circus will forever live on thanks to photographer @entity13			1
the one - ring show started in 1998 , and the following year visited @entity15 , @entity16 , where @entity13 lived at the time			1
she quickly became obsessed , wanting to know more about the people involved , and , with @entity3 blessing , following the circus every summer from that year right up until the end			2
while other shows were strict about hiding their performers until it was time for them to be in the big top , @entity38 was open			2
' it felt like home in the back , ' she told @entity47			0
' they were with their children , having cookouts , repairing costumes			0
' this experience was very different from the others			0
' over the years performers would come and go , but the circus remained the same despite its changes in acts			2
each summer @entity13 would shoot behind - the - scenes in black - and - white using only natural light			1
as a mother herself , she was drawn to the parents in the show and how they managed their children			0
' they had the ability to strap their kids in the stroller , do these death - defying acts , then put on their shoes and return to the trailer , ' @entity13 said			1
afternoon nap : @entity13 has published her images into a book called circus : a traveling life child star : as a mother herself , @entity13 was particularly interested in the parents and their kids multi-tasking : candid : @entity13 's photo book contains almost 100 black - and - white portraits @entity84 : @entity13 photographed the circus until the end of its run in 2007 @entity13 said that , while the circus folk were fine with being photographed , it was initially difficult to get them to act the way she hoped because ' they immediately act ' , she told @entity94 in october			1
' i wanted to provide more of a human side to it — a sense of family and tradition and culture and love of performance , ' she said			0
@entity13 would usually go to the shows and then leave at night			2
sometimes she stayed with them if it was too late			0
' i dreamt of having my own trailer , but usually i ’d leave when the lights would go down , ' she told @entity109			0
' i did it even when my kids were little			0
' my family thought i ’d lost my mind			0
' for more information @entity13 's work , visit her website , www.normaiquintana.com snap shot : the book represents a decade - long collaboration with the families and performers of @entity0			1

photographer @entity13 spent 10 summers travelling with the @entity0
it was forced to close down in 2007
she has since published a book , circus : a @entity132 , of the images she *collected* over the decade
