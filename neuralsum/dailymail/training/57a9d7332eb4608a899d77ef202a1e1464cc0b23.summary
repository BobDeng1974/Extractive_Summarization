however , the office of police and crime commissioner @entity23 has reiterated he has no intention to step down from his role , despite the mounting public pressure			1
at least 1,400 girls were left to be abused by @entity30 men because the authorities were too scared to admit there was a race issue , a recent report said			0
but police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist			0
mr @entity1 , who joined @entity3 in 2009 , said : ' i believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks , and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery			1

i believe that new leadership will enable the town to recover more quickly from the events of the last two weeks , and strongly signal a new beginning at this critical time in its recovery			0
the time is therefore now right for me to leave			0
' i will be sorry to leave @entity39 but firmly believe that this will leave the council in a stronger position in the future			0
it is therefore the right thing to do in the interests of the people of the town			0
mr @entity1 said he was committed to supporting his colleagues at @entity3 ( pictured ) over the next three months ' i remain committed to supporting colleagues over the next three months			2
there is no more important job for this council than to ensure it continues to work with partners to seek justice for those young people and their families who are affected by this vile crime , and to give our vulnerable children and young people the protection they deserve			0
