by @entity0 @entity2 ’s command over @entity3 has been diluted for the first time in 40 years with the announcement that he is no longer signing the cheques			1
the landmark statement came on thursday from the sport ’s parent company @entity8 , seemingly bringing an end to ‘ @entity11 ’ — his @entity13 - like hold over virtually every aspect of @entity3 ’s billion - dollar empire			1
but later @entity2 defiantly refused to countenance the idea that he was being stripped of his power , posing the question : ‘ if people want to shake someone ’s hand ( on a deal ) , whose hand do they shake ? it will still be my hand			2
’ on trial : the 83 - year - old will stand trial on criminal charges later this year , a @entity27 court has announced @entity31 prosecutors ... allege @entity2 paid @entity32 a £ 27.5million bribe to ensure @entity35 ’s 47.2 per cent stake was sold to @entity36			1
@entity37 ... sold their 16.7 per cent stake to @entity38 for just £ 7.2m with a guarantee of 10 per cent of the proceeds if sold for more than £ 670m			0
it was sold to @entity36 for £ 467m			0
the media company claim @entity2 entered into a ‘ corrupt bargain ’ with @entity32 to undervalue @entity38 ’s stake			2
@entity45 ... also claim to have missed out on a significant sum when @entity2 allegedly undervalued their 47.2 per cent stake when it was sold to @entity36			2
. filed a £ 408m lawsuit at the @entity50 in 2012 against @entity2 , @entity36 and @entity38 , alleging @entity2 bribed @entity32 to ensure the @entity38 stake was sold to @entity36 , despite their offer of ‘ 10 per cent above any genuine bona fide offer ’			2
@entity56 prosecutors ... are investigating whether the alleged £ 27.5m bribe paid by @entity2 to @entity32 was a criminal offence under @entity56 law after a complaint brought by an unnamed ‘ third party ’			2
@entity2 added : ‘ that is how i do business , always have done and it will be the same in the future			2
‘ these changes were discussed a year ago and agreed			0
they are a bit theatrical really			0
‘ we have to do things more formally than in the past — very formally			0
‘ it has not been my style but it is part of what we need to do because we have been thinking about floating the business			0
that is all there is to it			0
’ the announcement comes as @entity2 fights four cases concerning alleged bribery , including a criminal case in @entity27 , where the prosecutors have formally charged him — the development that prompted the restructuring			1
he could also face charges in @entity56 where , after a complaint from a ‘ third party ’ , investigations are under way to establish whether there was any criminal activity under @entity56 law			0
thursday 's statement said : ‘ the board of @entity95 ( the holding company for the @entity8 of companies ) has met today to discuss the decision of the @entity98 to commence proceedings against mr @entity2			1
‘ mr @entity2 has reassured the board that he is innocent of the charges and intends to vigorously defend the case which will commence in late april 2014			1
’ @entity2 is accused of paying £ 27.5million to @entity27 banker @entity32 — who has already been sentenced to jail in @entity27 — so that he would push through the sale of the sport to its current majority owners , @entity36 , a private equity firm , in 2006			1
however , @entity8 added : ‘ after discussion with the board , mr @entity2 has proposed , and the board has agreed , that until the case has been concluded he will step down as a director with immediate effect , thereby relinquishing his board duties and responsibilities until the case has been resolved			1
keeping faith : @entity118 team principal @entity117 insists @entity2 is still the ' right man for the job ' ‘ the board believes that it is in the best interests of both the @entity3 business and the sport that mr @entity2 should continue to run the business on a day - to - day basis but subject to increased monitoring and control by the @entity129			1
‘ mr @entity2 has agreed to these arrangements			2
the approval and signing of significant contracts and other material business arrangements shall now be the responsibility of the chairman , @entity137 , and deputy chairman , @entity138			0
’ @entity139 , who is in charge of @entity36 , declined to talk to @entity141			0
he has generally been loyal to @entity2 , though told the @entity142 in @entity143 last month that @entity2 would be replaced if he was found guilty			2
there was little reaction from the teams as news broke yesterday			0
they do not want to speak out against @entity2 while he may still be in power and have long believed the ‘ fact ’ that ‘ @entity2 still runs @entity3 ’ is the third guarantee of life , along with taxes and death			1
many also feel great affection and admiration towards him for the transformational role he has played in monetising the sport and elevating its status around the world			0
the only person who spoke up yesterday , did so in @entity2 ’s favour			2
@entity118 ’s @entity117 , who holidays with @entity2 and attended his latest wedding , said : ‘ @entity2 is absolutely the best and only guy to do what he does , to take @entity3 to the global reach that the sport has achieved , introducing races in @entity171 this year , going back to the @entity173 @entity172			1
‘ it ’s in all our interests that he ’s around as long as possible			0
’ @entity177 time : @entity2 on the grid in @entity179 at last year 's @entity180 @entity172 @entity2 recently spoke of @entity117 as his possible replacement — the first time he had publicly contemplated @entity3 in a @entity184 world			1
but at least one member of the @entity3 board would like to hasten @entity2 ’s demise : sir @entity188 , the founder and chief executive of multi-national advertising and public relations company @entity190			1
a jew , he was angry about comments @entity2 made lauding @entity194 as a man who ‘ got things done ’ in an interview in the @entity198 five years ago and has since kept a close , and often disapproving , eye on @entity2			0
while it is clear that @entity2 ’s tenure would entirely end if he went to jail in @entity27 , it is uncertain whether he would get his place on the board back if cleared of wrongdoing			1
the @entity27 trial starts in april and will drag on for several months — detaining @entity2 at the hearing which will take place for two days each week — and he will be in his mid- 80s by the time it is resolved			1
@entity2 ’s change of status throws doubt on the prospect of @entity3 agreeing a new @entity216 — the tripartite regulatory and commercial package between the rights holder ( represented by @entity2 ) , the @entity220 and the teams			1
a test of @entity2 ’s status will be whether he is still conducting those negotiations , or will @entity139 or @entity137 ? @entity2 , as he told the @entity142 last month , keeps all the papers in his offices and controls who sees them			0
it would , therefore , be difficult for anyone else to pick up the pieces immediately			0
and , despite the mighty symbolism of thursday 's developments , he wo n’t be handing over the keys readily .			0

@entity2 will stand trial in @entity27 on bribery charges later this year
the sport 's parent company have announced that the 83 - year - old will step down from the board but will remain in day - to - day control of @entity3
@entity2 will fight to clear his name and insists he did ' nothing *illegal* '
the *rignmaster* will be ' subjected to increased monitoring by the board '
@entity118 's @entity117 believes @entity2 is the ' only guy ' for the job
