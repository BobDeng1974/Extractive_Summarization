‘ he is a big part of what we do here			0
his age is n’t an issue in my view because he ’s a player whose strengths are n’t based on pace but his other attributes are likely to remain with him for any number of seasons after this one			0

' that means we do n’t let anybody leave even if there ’s a real interest or situations that might develop			0
it ’s about making sure we are strong as a club			0
from our point of view we are not anticipating anyone leaving , that ’s not what we need to do			0
