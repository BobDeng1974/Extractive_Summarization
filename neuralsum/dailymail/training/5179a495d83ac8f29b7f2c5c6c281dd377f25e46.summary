president @entity2 's intelligence briefings have provided him with specific information since before he won re-election in 2012 about the growing threat of the terror group now known alternatively as @entity7 and @entity7 , an administration insider told @entity8 on monday			1
' unless someone very senior has been shredding the president 's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them , highly accurate predictions about @entity7 have been showing up in the @entity15 since before the 2012 election , ' said a national security staffer in the @entity2 administration who is familiar with the content of intelligence briefings			1
the staffer declined to share anything specific about the content of those briefings , citing his need to maintain a security clearance			2
but ' it 's true , ' he said , ' that the [ intelligence ] community was sending pretty specific intel up to us			2
' ' we were seeing specific threat assessments and many of them have panned out exactly as we were told they would			0
' too little , too late ? @entity36 - led coalition airstrikes against targets near @entity38 , @entity40 welcome relief but do n't change tough questions about when the @entity42 knew @entity7 had become a genocidal terror army while @entity7 claims it is plotting attacks on @entity36 and @entity46 targets , president @entity2 says his intelligence chiefs failed to tell him how dire the threat was all along @entity2 campaigned in 2012 while @entity36 intelligence services provided him with specific information about the moves and threats of militants who would later declare themselves a state as @entity7 the aide said he is familiar with some of the material regarding the @entity58 that reaches @entity2 's desk			1
in a ' @entity62 ' interview that aired sunday , the president singled out @entity63 , his director of national intelligence , for blame in failing to understand the significance of the threat posed by the terror army that calls itself the @entity7			1
' our head of the intelligence community , @entity68 , ' @entity2 said , ' has acknowledged that , i think , they underestimated what had been taking place in @entity75			1
' that finger - pointing , @entity8 's source said , is not sitting well in the @entity42			2
' it 's starting to affect morale around here , ' he said			0
' any time you 're hired by a boss to advise him about what to do in a high - stakes area , and he ignores you for a long time , it 's going to gnaw at you			0
' and choosing a fall guy , he said , has a smell of desperation about it since the president was warned long ago what could happen if @entity7 , formerly known in the @entity95 as @entity7 , were left alone to fester following a @entity36 military withdrawal			1
the last @entity36 boots on the ground were airlifted from @entity99 in december 2011			2
in the months that followed , he explained , @entity36 intelligence services compiled detailed information about what the groups he called ' bad guys ' were doing to take advantage of the sudden power vacuum			1
and those briefings were specific about both the breadth of @entity7 's aims and their ability to run roughshod over large swaths of two countries			1
there 's ' no way ' the president should blame the alphabet - soup of intelligence agencies for what resulted , the aide said			1
' he had enough to go on ... he knew what was at stake			2
he knew where all the moving pieces were			1
' ' by february [ 2014 ] we had generals basically reading out their memos to @entity130 , ' he added , referring to testimony from lieutenant general @entity132 , the director of the @entity133			0
@entity132 predicted @entity7 ' probably will attempt to take territory in @entity99 and @entity75 to exhibit its strength in 2014			2
' the @entity137 terror group had already seized @entity138 and @entity139 , he said , had the ' ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in @entity75			0
' by the time @entity132 spoke on @entity142 , @entity130 had already heard the story at least once before			0
assistant secretary of state @entity144 told a @entity146 subcommittee in november 2013 that @entity7 had been militarily active all year because of ' a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of @entity150 security forces , poor operational tactics , and popular grievances , which remain unaddressed			1
' ' it has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in @entity75 , control of lucrative facilities there , such as oil wells , and regular movement of weapons and fighters between @entity75 and @entity99 , ' @entity144 said			0
is an air campaign enough ? @entity2 is sending planes like these @entity166 @entity165 over targets in @entity99 and @entity75 , but his enthusiasm for defeating the loathed @entity137 radicals is late in coming if he has been briefed about them for more than two years under the bus : @entity2 told the ' @entity62 ' program on sunday that ' our head of the intelligence community , @entity68 , has acknowledged that , i think , they underestimated what had been taking place in @entity75 ' asked monday whether the president heard that early warning and found it credible , @entity42 press secretary @entity180 told an @entity185 reporter that ' nobody could predict ... the ( lack of ) willingness of the @entity150 security forces to stand up and fight for their own country			1
' but @entity8 's source said that even @entity144 's warning bells were old news in the @entity42			1
the president , he said , was hearing information about @entity7 ' long before that			1
it goes back to the autumn of 2012			0
' @entity7 in @entity99 , he said , had already begun to metamorphose into @entity7 before @entity2 ran for president the first time			1
in 2006 the group 's @entity205 declared an @entity7 ' state ' in western and central @entity99 , a development @entity36 military intelligence was aware of since they were stationed ' in country			1
' by the late autumn of that year the nascent self - proclaimed @entity211 country was organized and holding open - air military parades			0
president @entity2 ordered @entity36 's military to pack up and return home at the end of 2011			1
by that time , the would - be nation @entity7 's goals had exploded to encompass controlling land in @entity75			2
and its tactical toolbox had grown to include the kind of genocidal preferences that @entity7 has showed in 2013 and 2014			0
while the @entity36 officially left no residual military force in @entity99 , the aide told @entity8 , small contingents of @entity226 and intelligence assets did remain behind			1
and the information they provided became part of the president 's briefings in the months that followed – right in the midst of presidential campaign season			1
the @entity42 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
shots across the bow : the president is seeing significant pushback now from members of the intel and national security communities who resent the @entity42 ignoring their warning for years still , @entity2 repeatedly claimed in his campaign speeches that his administration had left @entity58 terror groups hamstrung and hurting			1
' four years ago , i promised to end the war in @entity99 – and we did , ' he said during a sept. 13 , 2012 speech in @entity253			0
' i said we ’d wind down the war in @entity255 – and we are			0
' ' and while a new tower rises above the @entity259 skyline , @entity256 is on the path to defeat and @entity261 is dead			0
' those words came two days after a terror attack that left a @entity36 ambassador and three other @entity36 dead in @entity265 , @entity266			2
the administration later claimed he was referring to ' @entity256 core , ' the @entity271 - based mother ship once helped by @entity261			2
but @entity7 's roots as an @entity256 faction now make @entity2 's pronouncements look questionable			1
since the president 's @entity277 interview aired sunday night , a few intrepid whistle - blowers have poked their heads above @entity281 's parapets to disagree with his claim that his intelligence advisers failed to pinpoint the growing @entity7 threat			1
one former senior @entity286 aide told @entity287 that ' either the president does n't read the intelligence he ’s getting or he ’s bulls * * * ting			2
' like that former official , @entity8 's source requested anonymity			0
he echoed the @entity286 veteran 's concerns about how the president digests the information that @entity68 and others distill for him on a daily basis			2
' it 's pretty well - known that the president has n’t taken in - person intelligence briefings with any regularity since the early days of 2009 , ' the aide said			1
' he gets them in writing			0
' ' and it 's well - understood why			0
no one sits and watches him read them , and no one can come back later and tell @entity130 in a closed session that " i told the president this specific thing was likely to happen "			0
' @entity7 , which has its roots in @entity7 , is a 31,000 - strong terror army that has seized massive land areas in @entity99 and @entity75 and now occupies about one - third of both @entity317 chairman @entity316 , a @entity319 @entity318 , said late monday in a statement that @entity36 intelligence agencies have ' specifically warned ' for ' over a year ' that @entity7 ' was taking advantage of the situation in @entity75 to recruit members and provoke violence that could spill into @entity99 and the rest of the region			1
' in 2013 , he said , his committee ' formally pressed the administration for action to address the terrorist threat present in @entity75			0
' ' we all knew that former @entity150 prime minster @entity333 had mismanaged his military and gutted the @entity335 ( @entity336 ) of its top commanders			0
indeed , over a year ago , our @entity339 partners sought @entity36 support and leadership for a coordinated effort to address the extremist threat in eastern @entity75			2
' ' this was not an @entity346 failure , ' @entity316 said , ' but a failure by policy makers to confront the threat			0
' @entity351 @entity350 sen. @entity350 told a @entity353 audience on monday that he was ' puzzled by the president , some of his statements			0
... we predicted what would happen if we did n’t leave ( a ) residual force ' in @entity99			0
' the intelligence people are pushing back hard , ' @entity350 observed			0
' we predicted this and watched it , it was like watching a train wreck , and warning every step of the way that this was happening			0

a national security staffer in the @entity2 administration said the president has been seeing ' highly accurate predictions ' about the rise of the @entity7 terror army since ' before the 2012 election '
@entity2 **insisted** in his campaign speeches that year that @entity36 was safe and @entity256 was ' on the run '
the president said during sunday 's ' @entity62 ' program that his director of national intelligence had conceded he underestimated @entity7
but the administration aide **insisted** that @entity2 's advisers gave him actionable information that sat and gathered dust for more than a year
' he knew what was at stake , ' the aide said of the president , and ' he knew where all the moving pieces were '
@entity2 takes daily intelligence briefings in writing , he explained , because no one will be able to testify about warning the president in person about threats that the @entity42 does n't act on
