before that , he did the same job for mr @entity1 , also in the party ’s office in @entity39 , @entity27 , and considered both men to be among his closest friends			2
but after his diagnosis in 2013 he claims colleagues in the party accused of him of a lack of commitment to the cause , when in fact he was simply trying to battle cancer			2
‘ i became very disillusioned with the party because of the way they treated their own members			0

he has since been given the all - clear			0
he added : ‘ i ’ve never heard from @entity1			0
he never contacted me to see how i was doing , how the treatment was going , not one single word			0
if i see other @entity3 members , they physically ignore me			0
it feels very much like they ’ve been ordered not to speak to me			0
‘ a convicted terrorist who had the same cancer as me was shown compassion by the @entity3 , but i was given the cold shoulder			2
’ critics say mr @entity0 ’s case is yet another example of the callous way the @entity3 can treat even its own supporters			1

@entity117 : the former @entity3 member is now backing @entity11 candidate @entity26 , a local councillor , to oust his former boss @entity1 in @entity27 comparison : like @entity19 – the @entity7 bomber , left and right - mr @entity0 was diagnosed with prostate cancer - but mr @entity0 said the terrorist treated better than him by the party the @entity11 hopeful has the support of the @entity125 and @entity126 as part of a cross-party tactical voting bid to oust mr @entity1			1
despite the @entity3 flying high in the polls , mr @entity26 , who was the @entity11 election candidate in @entity27 in 2010 , believes he can pull off an upset			1
he said : ‘ people are looking for a change in representation			0
being the best placed of the @entity134 , i can take support from various parties			0
’ he added : ‘ the way @entity0 has been treated while dealing with a very difficult illness is shameful			2
’ @entity139 , who fought @entity27 four times for the @entity125 , is urging supporters to back mr @entity26			0
