given the typical undergraduate 's love of lie - ins , some might say they get enough sleep already			0
but one university is clearly worried its students could do with a little more rest , to the point where it has introduced a designated nap room			1
the ' @entity11 ' is based on a sleepy room opened at @entity13 at @entity14 , @entity15 , in the @entity16			2
sleepy students can book a 40 minute nap in the designated room ( pictured ) at the @entity20 students will be well catered for with comfy bags and chairs , white noise to block out the busy campus and blackout curtains			1
eye masks and anti-microbial pillows are also supplied in the room , which is open from noon until 6pm every day			1
students can simply turn up or reserve a slot in advance for 40 minutes of sleep â€“ monitored by @entity34 to make sure they abide by the rules			1
@entity37 , postgraduate students officer , said students live in a world of high expectations and volunteering , private study and nights out take their toll			2
he said students often live in noisy houses with their friends , with loud corridors , facing busy roads			1
and sleep is one thing that can be easily changed			0
@entity37 , 23 , of @entity51 , said : ' sleep is one of the biggest factors in a person 's life and one of the easiest things to change			0
' the nap room will give students a chance to see the benefits			1
' we hope the room will help , anything that encourages students to think positively about the benefits of sleep is a good thing			2
' students in particular are prone to bad sleeping habits			0
' the room is open from noon until 6pm each day - but students will be closely monitored to ensure they do n't break the rules ( picture posed by a model ) independent sleep expert dr @entity77 said the ' @entity11 ' was a good idea for hard - working students who had toiled in the library the previous night			1
but he warned students should value the importance of sleep and not use the room as an excuse to have a few extra drinks on a night out			2
dr @entity77 said : ' from a simple point of view it 's a good idea			0
drinking energy drinks such as @entity92 is only a temporary boost			0
' a short nap can boost your performance by 20 to 25 per cent			0
' it would be much better for the university to educate their students about the importance of their sleep			0
' if the students are needing the nap room because they are working hard then i am 100 per cent for that			1
