by @entity0 when @entity1 found she was pregnant , just a few months after suffering a miscarriage , she felt joy and anxiety in equal measure			1
while delighted to be expecting again , she was also worried her unborn baby might suffer the same sad fate as the one she had lost 16 weeks into her previous pregnancy			1
so , when a friend offered to lend her a foetal @entity10 - a handheld ultrasound listening device used by midwives at antenatal appointments - to check her unborn baby 's heartbeat , she leapt at the opportunity , never imagining the panic it would induce			1
twice as nice : @entity1 with her partner @entity19 and their one - year - old twins @entity22 and @entity23 ' i thought being able to hear my baby 's heart beating would be hugely reassuring , ' says @entity1 , 32 , of @entity27 , @entity28			1
' but i did n't bargain for the terror i 'd feel when i was unable to detect a heartbeat			1
' this happened several times			2
once , seven months into my pregnancy , i got into such a state that my partner , @entity34 , had to race me to @entity35 for an emergency scan			2
' everything was fine , but it took a few hours for me to calm down - not ideal when stress in pregnancy poses such a risk to you and your baby			1
' indeed , as foetal @entity46 become a must - have piece of kit for mums - to - be , the @entity45 has issued a warning about the risks they pose			1
they urge pregnant women to seek medical advice if they are worried about their baby , rather than attempting to self - diagnose with a doppler			1
' we advise against personal dopplers as it takes considerable training to use them properly , ' says @entity63 of the @entity45			1
' it can cause needless stress to a pregnant woman when she can not pick up her baby 's heartbeat			1
it can lead to raised blood pressure in the mother and premature births			2
12 weeks : @entity1 used a personal @entity73 to listen to her unborn children 's heartbeats ' more worrying , we 've had cases where there has been something wrong with a baby and the mother has been wrongly reassured after hearing her own heartbeat , or the sound of blood pumping through the placenta , leading to a dangerous delay in her seeking medical attention			1
in at least one instance , sadly the baby died			1
' so the message from midwives is loud and clear : leave the job to the professionals			2
although @entity46 for home use can be picked up for as little as £ 30 from online retailers including @entity97 , the £ 250 model @entity1 borrowed from her friend was identical to ones used in hospitals			1
in fact , it was so sensitive that , at ten weeks pregnant , @entity1 detected two foetal heartbeats and realised she was expecting twins			1
' at my first antenatal appointment i said to the midwife : " i think it 's twins , " ' recalls @entity1 , whose partner , @entity34 , 38 , is a chauffeur			2
' she could n't believe how early i 'd picked up the heartbeats			0
' @entity1 then used the doppler every other day , and fought the urge to listen in more often			1
' it sometimes took me 40 minutes to find a heartbeat and even longer to pick up two , because you do n't know whether you 're hearing the same heartbeat twice			0
i 'd get anxious checking and double checking , ' she says			0
' later in the pregnancy one of my twins was breech and the other head down , so it was a real struggle locating both of their little hearts			0
' i got into a terrible state seven months into the pregnancy because my breech baby was not moving very much and i could n't pick up a clear heartbeat			1
realising how worried i was , @entity34 took me to hospital			1
' thankfully the obstetrician who scanned me was able to reassure me that both our babies were fine			0
' the twins , @entity23 and @entity22 , were born in march last year , each weighing a robust 7lb			0
happy families : @entity23 and @entity22 were born in march last year , each weighing a robust 7lb although there are no official figures on the number of mums using @entity46 , midwives have reported a huge increase in pregnant women who admit to listening to their babies ' heartbeats at home			1
dr @entity151 , an obstetrician at the @entity153 's @entity152 , first raised the alarm in the summer of 2009 after a 27 - year - old woman was admitted to his antenatal ward due to reduced foetal movement 32 weeks into her first pregnancy			1
the unnamed woman told doctors that she had first noticed her baby had become less active two days previously , but had been reassured that all was well after using her own doppler to listen to its heartbeat			2
however , concerned by a lack of movement during monitoring , doctors performed an emergency caesarean later that evening			0
the baby was so unwell it spent its first eight weeks on the special care unit			2
while recognising the inevitable anxiety women experience during pregnancy , @entity63 , of the @entity45 , questions the ethics of companies which sell and loan personal @entity46			1
' i think it 's unethical for retailers to overstate their usefulness , ' says @entity63			0
' it 's far more important for mothers - to - be to tune into any changes they notice in their baby ’s movements than to encourage them to rely on a gadget			1
' pregnant : @entity189 ( left ) takes a selfie of her pregnancy bump , and used a foetal doppler in the hopes of reassuring herself that 's a lesson that @entity196 , an @entity197 receptionist from @entity198 , learnt the hard way			1
while pregnant with her fourth child , @entity200 , now six months old , she bought a @entity10 for £ 30 on @entity201			2
' i bought it so that our older children could hear the heartbeat and feel more involved , ' recalls @entity196 , 32			2
' but it was such a worrying pregnancy because i discovered early on that his heart rate was quite irregular			0
' i 'd creep off and listen while my husband , @entity210 , was supervising the children 's teatime			0
when i told my midwife about my concerns , she advised me to stop using the doppler because it was likely to be more stress - inducing than reassuring			2
' i could n't resist the temptation to listen in			0
however , i could n't make sense of what i was hearing			0
' as the pregnancy progressed , @entity196 was unable to hide her fears from @entity210 , 31 , a landscape gardener			0
from the 26th week of pregnancy , @entity196 was admitted to @entity225 in @entity198 no less than 12 times for monitoring after she raised concerns about her baby 's heart rate			2
the first prototype ultrasound system was developed in @entity232 in the fifties @entity200 was born at 37 weeks , three weeks before his due date , weighing just 4lb 6oz , but otherwise healthy			0
' after all those months of worry , of not knowing whether his irregular heart rate symbolised some underlying problem , it was such a relief to finally hold @entity200 , ' says @entity196			0
when a year later , she became pregnant with her youngest child , @entity240 , now five months old , she was far more cautious about using her doppler			2
' i picked up her heartbeat nine weeks into the pregnancy , ' recalls @entity196			0
' but then i only used the doppler a handful of times			0
yes , it was hugely tempting , but i could n't put myself through all that worry again for another nine months			0
' @entity189 is another mother who succumbed to home monitoring , much to her midwife 's disapproval			0
she bought a doppler for £ 40 , but struggled to detect her baby 's heartbeat			2
' i finally heard something at 24 weeks , but even then it was hard to detect , ' says @entity189 , 21 , a trainee teacher			0
' i thought the @entity10 was going to reassure me but in fact it did the opposite			0
' i rang my midwife in a state when i could n't hear anything			0
she said they do n't recommend personal @entity46			1
' she said it did n't help for me to be worried because the baby would become stressed and the heartbeat would be even harder to find			1
after that , i did n't dare call her again when i could n't detect a heartbeat so i 'd just keep trying and fretting			0
' pretty in pink : @entity189 with her daughter , six - month - old @entity270 eight months into her pregnancy , @entity189 's baby became worryingly still , but she decided not to seek immediate help when her mind was put at rest after checking for the heartbeat herself			1
' because i 'd heard the heartbeat , i decided to hold on until the following day when i had an antenatal appointment , ' says @entity189			0
' but towards evening time , she still was n't moving so i called my midwife who told me to go straight into the assessment unit			0
' @entity189 's daughter , @entity281 , was born five days past her due date at @entity283 , weighing 8 lb 2.5 oz. ' she 's healthy so there was no need for all that angst , ' says @entity189			0
' if i have another baby , i wo n't use the doppler again - it 's not worth all the stress it causes			1
' how ironic , then , that this is a device marketed with the promise of alleviating anxiety in pregnancy .			0
