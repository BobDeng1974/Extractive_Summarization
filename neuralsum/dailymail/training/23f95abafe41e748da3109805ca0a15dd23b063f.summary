by @entity0 published : 04:22 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 17 november 2013 @entity1 , mp for @entity3 and the ex @entity5 water minister , said he was thankful for the rain last summer as the @entity8 ' dodged a bullet ' @entity8 was saved from using standpipes thanks to the jubilee downpours last year , the former @entity5 water minister has said			1
@entity1 , mp for @entity3 , has said he felt immense relief last year when it started raining just before the @entity15 's celebrations began because we were just a few months from ' humiliation as a country '			1
the @entity19 had told him during the summer that there was just a three per cent chance of enough rain falling to refill the nation 's reservoirs			1
in an interview with @entity26 , he said : ' i immediately thought of the jubilee and the @entity29 , thinking : ' how are we going to do this ? ' @entity32 assured me there would be enough water for the @entity35 , and all the activities and the hotels , but it would be at a price			2
' @entity40 would have looked awful : brown parks , prematurely leafless trees ; there could have been very serious water restrictions in parts of the south - east , such as @entity46			2
' we knew we were facing a serious problem			0
and then it rained and we dodged a bullet			0
' the deluge started just before the @entity15 's jubilee flotilla celebrations , and continued into winter , only pausing for the @entity29			2
@entity1 's said his comments were made to stop the short term thinking that has dominated the recent debate over bringing down water bills			1
the @entity58 celebrations last year were marked by the largest flotilla seen on the @entity60 in 350 years as well as torrential rain which lead to the wettest june on record in total 548 people had to be check for hypothermia after the flotilla finished due to the weather he said : ' household bills are obviously important			1
but for heaven 's sake , i really hope we can link the need to keep bills lower with the need for investment and protection of the environment			1
' the investment tap can be really quickly turned off if international sovereign wealth funds and pensions funds , who quite like our regulated sector at the moment , think some of the language being used by politicians makes it not the sector in which they want to invest			2
' he called for more water meters to be imposed in people 's homes , increased investment in new reservoirs and greater connectivity between existing water storage			1
he also said there should be a crackdown on the cheap option of companies draining the nation 's rivers to meet shortages in supply			0
@entity1 says before the downpour started he was warned the country was just months away from having to use standpipes in @entity40 leading to ' humiliation as a country ' the mp called for more water meters and investment in reservoirs , and said that debates about bringing down water bills could scare off investors the 1,000 boat flotilla which sailed down the @entity60 last june was the most spectacular event to be held on the river for 350 years			1
however high winds and heavy rain caused some problems , especially among the @entity122 who sang @entity124 along with the national anthem while pulling soggy strands of hair from their faces			0
in fact the weather was so bad that paramedics checked them over for hypothermia once they were back on dry land			0
in total 548 people were checked for signs of the condition , brought about by extreme cold			0
according to the @entity139 , june last year was the wettest since records began in 1910 , with 145.3mm of rainfall recorded , more than twice as much as normal			0
