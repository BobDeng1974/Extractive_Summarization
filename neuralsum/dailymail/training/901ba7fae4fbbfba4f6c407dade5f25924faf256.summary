click here to see @entity1 50 - 41 click here to see @entity1 40 - 31 click here to see @entity1 30 - 21 the centre forward : the leader from the front , the @entity8 9 , the provider , the talisman , the goalscorer			2
since 1992 , the @entity10 has been blessed with the best , from homegrown talents @entity11 and @entity13 , to foreign imports @entity15 and @entity16			1
in this international week , we are begging for goals , and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy			0
here , @entity23 runs you through @entity1 20 - 11 of the best strikers to have ever graced the @entity10 ... do you agree ? 20			1
@entity26 ( @entity27 ) still in the prime of his career , there ’s every chance @entity26 could end up higher in this list if we were to re-visit it in five years ' time			1
but 64 goals in 98 league outings for @entity27 is n’t a bad start			0
@entity27 paid a pretty penny - £ 38m - for the @entity41 ’s service back in 2011 but he did n’t waste any time making an impression , scoring a 30 - yarder on debut against @entity46			2
and , of course , his dramatic last - gasp goal against @entity49 to win @entity27 the title will never be forgotten			2
he is arguably the best striker in the @entity10 at the moment , as 12 goals in 11 games so far this season in an otherwise shaky team have testified			1
@entity26 has been a hit for @entity27 ever since his £ 38m move from @entity57 in 2011 @entity26 scored a dramatic late winner against @entity49 to help @entity27 win the @entity10 title in 2012 ahead of @entity60 19			1
@entity61 ( @entity62 , @entity60 , @entity27 ) from one @entity41 hotshot to another , @entity61 dragged @entity62 to @entity10 survival in 2007 with seven priceless goals , including the winner at @entity68 on the final day of the season			1
his move to @entity60 that summer was protracted but @entity61 was an instant favourite , winning hearts for his committed and high - energy performances			2
sir @entity74 bought him to score important goals and that ’s what he did , especially in his first season when he ended up a @entity10 and @entity80 winner			1
calls to ' sign him up ' fell on deaf ears and @entity61 joined rivals @entity27 , prompting the famous ' welcome to @entity84 ' billboard			0
@entity61 struck 23 and then 20 league goals in his first two seasons , and netted 58 times in all before leaving for @entity88			2
@entity61 helped @entity62 avoid relegation from the @entity10 after joining from @entity91 side @entity90 @entity61 played for both @entity84 giants , the highlight of which being his two @entity10 titles with @entity60 in 2008 and 2009 18			1
@entity95 ( @entity96 ) some would argue with his racism and biting controversies , @entity95 should be nowhere near this list			1
but we ’re hear to talk purely about goals and 69 @entity10 strikes in 110 matches for @entity96 means there is certainly a place			1
this was the man who powered @entity96 to within touching distance of their first post- 1992 title last season with 31 goals			0
and the season before that , he claimed 30			0
@entity95 averaged a hat - trick every 20 games , the best rate of all the players to have score more than one treble in the @entity10			1
aided by @entity121 , he smashed all kinds of records last season and , despite adversity , won the @entity126 and the @entity128 award			0
@entity95 scored 31 goals last season to lead @entity96 to the brink of the @entity10 title the @entity131 was named @entity128 and sealed a £ 75m dream move to @entity133 in the summer 17			1
@entity134 ( @entity135 , @entity96 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 ) one of the @entity10 ’s finest strikers of the mid- to late - @entity141 , @entity134 scored a remarkable 41 goals in 65 league appearances for @entity135 and 28 in 64 for @entity96			1
after helping @entity135 back up to the top division in 1994 , @entity134 ’s 22 goals helped them to an unexpected third - place finish			1
forging an irrepressible strike partnership with @entity148 , he averaged a goal every 2.5 games for @entity96 and created many more			0
his dramatic late winner against @entity152 , destroying their titles hopes in 1996 , will never be forgotten			0
@entity134 scores a dramatic late winner against @entity152 in @entity96 's famous 4 - 3 win in 1996 @entity134 scored 41 goals in 65 league outings for @entity135 and helped them back into @entity159 's top - flight 16			1
@entity160 ( @entity161 ) the ultimate one - club man , @entity160 ’s record of 100 @entity10 goals and 209 overall for @entity161 rivals any attacker			1
he was already an established goalscorer by the time the @entity10 was formed in 1992 and continued in the rich vein afterwards			1
he had an uncanny ability to score classy goals - that immaculate control and blistering finish against @entity152 in 1993 sticks in the memory			2
oh and the touch , swivel and 30 - yard volley later in the match			2
his awesome penalty record must not be overlooked either - unfazed by pressure , he scored all but one of his spot - kicks			2
little wonder he is worshipped as ' @entity183 ' on the south coast			0
@entity160 scored 209 goals for @entity161 during his 16 years with the south coast club @entity160 shoots against @entity60 in 1996 on a day @entity161 won 3 - 1 but the match is better remembered for that kit 15			2
@entity189 ( @entity136 , @entity60 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 ) with his smile and relaxed gait , @entity189 is probably the most laid - back striker on this list but when it came to the business of scoring goals , he was deadly serious			1
the hotshot from @entity200 first shot to prominence at @entity136 , converting to a striker in the 1995 - 1996 season and helping @entity136 to @entity205 success			0
in all , he scored 73 league goals for the club both before and after 1992			0
@entity189 joined @entity60 in 1998 and was the missing piece in @entity74 ’s jigsaw as his haul of 29 goals and telepathic partnership with @entity13 ended in @entity214 glory			0
he continued to score at a prodigious rate for @entity60 , helping them to a further two @entity10 titles in 2000 and 2001			2
@entity189 scored 73 league goals for @entity136 and helped them to @entity205 success before moving to @entity60 @entity189 moved to @entity60 and formed a formidable strike partnership with @entity13 ( right ) 14			0
@entity220 ( @entity221 ) the man @entity222 described as a ‘ wizard ’ and @entity74 called a ‘ clever little so - and - so ’ was the star of @entity221 ’s first cosmopolitan team in the late nineties			1
his £ 4.5m price tag proved a bargain and he helped @entity230 ’s team to @entity232 glory in 1997 , as well as the @entity205 and @entity233 the following season			0
gloriously skilful and a regular goalscorer , he was adored by the @entity221 faithful , who voted him their best - ever player in a 2003 survey			0
in all , he scored 59 goals in 229 league matches for the @entity241			0
his audacious mid-air back heel against @entity243 in the @entity232 in 2002 was the pick of his goals			0

@entity251 ( @entity135 , @entity252 , @entity60 , @entity253 , @entity62 ) @entity251 ’s professional career spanned an incredible 24 years , giving plenty of time to fit in his grand total of 355 goals			2
his first @entity10 involvement was with @entity135 , briefly , and then @entity252 , with whom he became the maiden season ’s top scorer in 1992 - 1993			1
he continued to score at a furious rate before moving to @entity60 for £ 3.5m in 1997 as the replacement for @entity266			0
the success and silverware that eluded him for most of his career quickly arrived , with three @entity10 title wins , an @entity232 and the @entity80			2
he famously scored @entity60 ’s last - gasp equaliser in the final with @entity275 and was named @entity128 in 2001			0

@entity314 ( @entity49 , @entity152 , @entity252 , @entity62 , @entity137 , @entity315 ) direct and deadly in front of goal , @entity314 racked up 149 goals in the @entity10			2
the first of those came with @entity49 and in the inaugural @entity10 campaign , his 20 goals carrying the west @entity323 club to an unlikely fifth place finish			1
he backed this up with hauls of 16 and 24 in the next two campaigns , prompting title challengers @entity152 to pay £ 6m for his services			0
