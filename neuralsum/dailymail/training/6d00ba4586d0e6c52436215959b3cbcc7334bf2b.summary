@entity0 is on the hunt for a new agent right now and in the discussions he has had so far he is said to be making certain demands			1
he wants to know how much money he will make beyond his playing contract at @entity7 : endorsement deals and such like			2
and he wants an assurance that any agreement comes with a job for his older brother , @entity12 , having secured him a position with his previous management company			2
never mind that it was only a few days before pre-season training resumed at @entity7			2
never mind that competition for places in the @entity41 midfield has rarely appeared more intense			2
it ’s only a cigarette , or a cigar ( he was photographed smoking one of those , too ) , or another cocktail			2
their dad , @entity48 , was there in @entity20 , so perhaps we should n’t blame @entity12			0
this might sound like an over-reaction and a bit unfair			0
for a start , @entity0 is not exactly alone when it comes to elite athletes who enjoy an occasional puff when they spend most of their lives striving for physical perfection			1
stagnated : there are worries about the @entity7 player 's progress over the past few years return : @entity0 is set to join up with @entity7 for pre-season next week , after his @entity20 holiday more worrying in @entity0 ’s case is the fact that this is not the first time it has happened and that the 22 - year - old midfielder has failed to act after the first incident — when he expressed remorse having been photographed smoking last october — by making sure he does not find himself in the same position again			1
it might not have mattered quite so much had @entity0 been reflecting on a marvellous season at @entity7 and a brilliant @entity76			1
he was reflecting on a mediocre , injury - troubled season amid accusations that his career has stood still these past couple of years			0
@entity80 said as much on tv and this week his view was echoed by former @entity7 manager @entity83			0
glory : @entity0 won his first silverware for @entity7 last season but faces competition for his place one club man : the midfielder has been with @entity7 since he was a boy but they fear he is not progressing ‘ his career has not gone anywhere in the last 18 months , ’ said @entity83 before suggesting this latest controversy demanded a dressing down from current @entity7 manager @entity93			1
and when @entity0 ’s own family see no harm in smoking and drinking and there is no agent , at least not at the moment , to pull him into line , it is @entity93 ’s responsibility to tackle a footballer in danger of wasting his considerable talent			1
the evidence would suggest he is capable of squandering the gifts he was blessed with and what we actually have here is yet another great @entity113 footballing talent whose career is undermined by personality flaws			2
look , even , at @entity117			0
potential that , for different reasons , is never quite realised			0
mentor : it will be down to @entity93 to take responsibility for @entity0 's personal development unimpressive : the youngster had a difficult @entity76 , as @entity23 crashed out in the @entity125 some would consider that to be harsh and not just in the case of the sometimes brilliant @entity117			1
only recently , senior @entity129 officials were pleased to report how @entity0 had come of age during @entity23 ’s brief stay in @entity132 this summer			1
he was said to have been the model professional , applying himself with maturity even when he knew he was excluded from @entity136 ’s starting line - up for the opening two group games			0
his colleagues at @entity7 would also report how dedicated @entity0 was in returning to fitness last summer after finally recovering from a troublesome ankle injury			1
but in private some of those colleagues have also questioned whether he respects the athletic talent he possesses as much as he should			2
lost vegas : how @entity0 appeared on the back page of the @entity30 plied with champagne : @entity17 ( middle row , right ( circled ) ) poured bubbly down @entity0 's neck in @entity20 whether he is as professional as he needs to be when the modern game places such huge physical demands on the players			1
@entity7 coaching staff , who regard him as a likeable ‘ cheeky chappie ’ , do not feel his game has progressed in the way it should over the past year and it is acknowledged that this season will be an acid test			0
there is little doubt he does not respect the position he has as a sporting role model , however inappropriate it might seem to burden a young man with such responsibility			0
‘ it ’s either arrogance or stupidity but he just does n’t get it , ’ remarked one observer			0
this week officials at the @entity170 were said to be deeply disappointed by his behaviour			0
it has not escaped the attention of the same agents he has been courting that he might not appreciate the role he needs to play in securing endorsement deals			0
potential : @entity117 , like @entity0 , broke onto the scene , and into the @entity23 team , at a young age struggles : @entity117 has never quite lived up to the incredible expectations put upon him right now he has lucrative contracts with @entity183 and @entity184 but blue - chip brands are unlikely to come running after seeing the images from @entity20 this week			1
the detail of @entity0 ’s ‘ boys ’ trip ’ is unlikely to impress them , either			1
organised , apparently , around a friend ’s stag party at the @entity194 on the main @entity195 , the trip became more of an @entity23 footballer affair when @entity0 discovered @entity197 and @entity198 were also going to be there with friends			1
they threw a ‘ wet and wild ’ party , with @entity0 said to have had champagne poured down his throat by former @entity7 masseur @entity17 — a la @entity205 and the ‘ dentist ’s chair ’ in @entity208 in 1996			1
@entity0 is thought to have hired a whole floor of the hotel , with a pool , and guests were asked to surrender their phones so pictures could not be taken : a strategy that did not exactly pay off			1
perhaps @entity0 ’s father , a 49 - year - old former builder who is fiercely protective of his family , saw no harm in his son letting off a bit of steam			1
back on track : the @entity41 midfielder posted this more serene picture on @entity225 after the controversy wasted talent : @entity116 succumbed to alcohol as he failed to reach his potential precedent : @entity116 mocked his critics by imitating the infamous ' dentists chair ' while celebrating a goal but when @entity0 already has something of a track record for trouble , maybe he would have been better advising against a hedonistic hotspot such as @entity20			1
as far back as august 2010 , @entity0 was getting into scrapes			1
he sparked a nightclub brawl by telling a girl to ditch her boyfriend because he and his friends had ‘ more money ’			0
@entity244 broke an elbow when she fell trying to protect boyfriend @entity247 as @entity0 ’s friends attacked them			1
the @entity254 , celebrating her 21st birthday at the @entity252 club in @entity253 , said @entity0 kept telling her to join his party before a crude sexual remark sparked a fight			1
@entity244 needed metal pins inserted in her arm and @entity0 , who claimed to be the peacemaker in the incident , was given a police caution for common assault while @entity267 and @entity268 each pleaded guilty to affray			1
caution : @entity0 was in trouble in 2010 for an incident which saw @entity244 break an elbow time to shine : with @entity7 's summer spending @entity0 needs to start performing to justify his place @entity268 , who left @entity247 with a gashed eye , also admitted assault			1
the following march , @entity0 hurled insults at taxi driver @entity278 , 64 , after realising he was a @entity279 fan			1
‘ @entity0 ’s behaviour is the worst i ’ve ever seen in all my time as a cabbie , ’ said @entity278			2
‘ no one deserves to be spat at just because of the team they support			0
' he was behaving appallingly , but when he noticed my @entity279 hat it got a lot worse			0
he suddenly started calling me every name under the sun. ‘ he walked straight up to me and said , “ you ’re f * * * * * g taking us ” , as he pointed to my cab			0
when i told him he was too drunk he got even more aggressive and started screaming at me that i should take him and his mates			0
’ in that instance @entity0 accepted another police caution and apologised for his behaviour			2
@entity0 , who now has a young family of his own — a girlfriend and two children — is from a tough , working - class background			1
during his formative years he would attend @entity7 ’s academy in @entity305 and the coaches who worked with him remember what a wonderful young player he was : head and shoulders above other kids his age			0
he would often play with youngsters two years above his age group			0
fan favourite : the @entity41 star is still very popular with the club 's fans despite a disappointing season pain : injuries have blighted the young star 's early career but he should be fit for the new season at that stage he did everything right , focusing on football			0
the only negative was that his coaches did not think he would be captain material because he wanted the ball too much and was too involved in the game to be able to organise other things			0
but they knew as long ago as when he was 13 that he was destined to become an @entity7 player — and an @entity23 international			0
one of his early coaches believes @entity0 has lost his innocence about only wanting to play football and feels he has been caught up too much in stuff away from the game			2
however , the coach claims every talented young player goes through that period and that @entity0 needs to realise what is important			2
on one wall at @entity305 a photograph has pride of place			0
it is a teenage @entity0 staring in awe at @entity350			2
one only hopes he admires @entity350 more for his genius than his own , hell - raising behaviour — and recognises that before @entity350 ’s fall he enjoyed quite a rise .			0

*ex-arsenal* masseur plied him with champagne
his family see no harm in him smoking and drinking
@entity0 , who has had his fair share of controversy off the pitch , is in danger of wasting his talent
