monkeys in the wild not only love watching videos , but they also tend to copy the behaviour seen on screen , according to a new study			1
when scientists showed marmosets footage of a monkey opening a box to get a banana , they were able to replicate what they saw and open the box themselves			1
the study , undertaken in @entity16 , @entity17 , reveals new insights into how monkeys learn from each other in the wild , according to @entity23 and @entity24 researchers			1
wild marmosets were chosen because they are native to @entity17 and very social , curious creatures			1
the species tend to live in small families in clearly defined territories			2
they can be fierce creatures if someone disturbs their home			0
but among themselves , marmosets are close - knit community			2
the whole family usually raises a child , and infants learn life skills from older group members			0
wild marmosets were chosen because they are native to @entity17 , and very social , curious creatures			1
the species tend to live in small families , ranging on average from five to 15 monkeys , in a clearly defined territories			0
they can be fierce creatures if someone disturbs their home ‘ how - to ’ videos have been a success when shown to monkeys in captivity , but this is the first time they were used to train creatures in the wild monkeys can use symbols to add , researchers have found			2
experts say the discovery could give new insight into the evolutionary origins of our ability to count			0
the found rhesus monkeys can not only differentiate between symbols but also add the values of two symbols at a time with 90 % accuracy			0
@entity88 , a neuroscientist at @entity89 , led the study in the journal @entity92			2
the team developed a series of tests for rhesus monkeys , which diverged from humans roughly 25 million years ago			0
given the choice of two different symbols , the monkeys chose the symbol that represented the larger reward with up to 90 % accuracy , suggesting that the monkeys had learned to assign specific values to the 26 distinct abstract symbols			0
' the monkeys demonstrated the ability to not only differentiate between the symbols but also to add the values of two symbols at a time , ' the researchers wrote			0
@entity111 at the @entity112 , @entity23 , worked with researchers at @entity114 to film a common marmoset retrieving a banana slice from a plastic device			1
they then placed a screen in a protective enclosure in the jungle and played the video on loop			2
the researchers filmed different groups of marmosets as they were drawn to the enclosure and then acted on what they saw			1
twelve groups were filmed , 108 marmosets in total , with some of the groups seeing video of marmosets opening the box using the drawer , others lifting the lid			1
one group was shown a still image			0
twelve of the marmosets were able to open the box , 11 of which had seen it done first in a video			1
one monkey could do it after just seeing the still image			0
this suggests , compared to monkeys shown a static image , video - watching marmosets were more likely to open the device , typically copying the technique shown			1
young monkeys spent more time near the video box than older family members , suggesting that they found the movie more entertaining			2
professor @entity111 would now like to set up similar experiments to find out whether monkeys are more likely to watch a dominant group - member			0

the study was undertaken in the jungles of @entity16 in @entity17
scientists filmed a marmoset retrieving a banana from a plastic box
they then showed footage and images to 108 marmosets in the wild
12 marmosets were able to open box , 11 of which had seen the video
