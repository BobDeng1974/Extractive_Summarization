by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 3 september 2013 the reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons in @entity5 public schools has caused surprise unrest			1
state representative , @entity7 who was behind the move , told today this morning that she has received a number of ' personal ' complaints from educators and parents			1
one father - of - two telephoned her to tell her that handwriting is a ' total waste of time ' , while a teacher complained that ' these children will never use it in their lifetime			1
' the write stuff : the reintroduction of cursive handwriting lessons into @entity5 public schools has caused surprise unrest , with parents and teachers deeming it ' outdated ' before the bill , elementary schools were not required to teach cursive			1
this is because the national @entity34 , rolled out in 2010 and adopted by 45 @entity36 states , does not include it as part of the curriculum			1
instead students are required to ' demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills			2
' ms @entity43 , said she was inspired to push for the @entity45 bill , after she received thank you notes from a group of fourth graders , following a field trip			1
' it struck me as strange that they were not writing [ in cursive ] , ' she said			2
' it was like these kids were n’t educated			0
i mean , this is n’t hieroglyphics we ’re talking about			0
' ' it was like these kids were n't educated			0
i mean , this is n't hieroglyphics we 're talking about ' thanks to her campaigning , the bill was passed on april 4 2013 , drawing 107 yes votes with no dissenters			1
however , now she has revealed that there has since been ' pushback ' from the public			0
indeed , @entity74 expressed his opposition to writing lessons in an article for @entity78			0
' we have machines to do this stuff for us			0
who writes letters anymore ? ' except for signing my name to checks and legal documents , i ’ve barely used cursive in 20 years			2
all my writing happens at a keyboard			0
@entity91 , i think , is progress			0
' with so much to teach our students , maybe we should stick to the stuff they ’ll actually find useful as workers and as citizens			0
@entity99 is n’t really on that list			0
' others argue that while handwriting is important , cursive is n't			1
@entity104 : today 's school curriculum requires students to ' demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills ' and no guidelines on handwriting are included handwriting expert and instructor @entity112 told @entity114 : ' teaching handwriting does n’t mean it has to be cursive , any more than teaching math means it has to be in roman numerals			1
' she advocates for students learning to read cursive but opposes cursive handwriting mandates , saying that cursive writing should just be an elective			1
despite this , the majority appear to be on ms @entity43 's side			0
' i do n't think we ’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point			2
we need to prepare our students for the unknown future ' @entity132 , a mother - of - two from @entity133 , @entity134 , told today that she thinks ' it ’s important to be able to write it to be a functioning member of society			2
' and @entity139 , a third grade teacher in @entity140 , @entity141 , pointed out : ' i do n’t think we ’re in a world that is completely cursive free at this point			2
we need to prepare our students for the unknown future			0
' meanwhile @entity145 actress , @entity146 wrote on @entity147 : ' i 'm horrified to hear that @entity36 children will no longer learn @entity99 ! ! ! ! american children would not be able to read the @entity150			1
