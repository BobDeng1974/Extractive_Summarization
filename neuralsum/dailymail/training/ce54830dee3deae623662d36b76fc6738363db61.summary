however much @entity1 's pigeons are universally disliked , many would admit their freedom to roam the city 's skies fills them with jealously			0
the filthy urban birds truly have the run of the city , with the best views of the city 's landmarks like the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity16 researchers have combined the @entity18 flight simulator with a motion sensitive controller to allow people to fly around the city using bird movements			1
the research is part of work into urban simulations and procedural modelling undertaken by a team from the @entity51 for @entity52 ( @entity53 ) at @entity54			1
as part of the public outreach side of the work , they have created a the @entity27 where you can fly like a pigeon exploring different parts of @entity1			0
the simulator uses a @entity31 sensor to track users ' body movements and gestures and converts them into movements through @entity68 's web plugin			2
become one with the pigeon : this image shows how the software reads to user 's movements and translates them to pigeon movements within the simulator bird foot : pigeon footprints mark the spot where users stand to control the simulator @entity80 , head of @entity53 , said his team were hoping to bring the simulator to the @entity82 for the public to try and were in negotiation to have one installed in a public area of @entity1 's @entity13			1
' it 's fun but it 's trying to communicate a point that there 's all these live feeds out there , ' he told @entity91			0
' every time we tweet and every time we use a phone we are putting these live feeds out there which can be put to use			0
' he added : ' we can write reports that go out to councils and government offices , but people do n't really read those ; but if you can fly around @entity103 or @entity1 then you can see things like traffic flows and all this data presented			2

*developed* by researchers from @entity54 's @entity51 for @entity109
they hope to bring the simulator to the *museum* of @entity103 and install one in a public area of @entity13 in the near *future*
