by @entity0 last updated at 4:32 pm on 1st november 2011 breakthrough : scientists in have genetically engineered rice to produce high levels of human blood albumin , a protein used to treat serious injury and disease scientists in @entity10 believe they have found a way of harvesting large amounts of a human blood protein used to treat burns , trauma injuries and liver disease - from grains of rice			1
when extracted from rice seeds , the protein is ' physically and chemically equivalent to blood - derived human serum albumin ( @entity22 ) , ' according to research published in the @entity25 @entity24			1
the findings could lead to a breakthrough in production of @entity22 , which typically comes from human blood donations			1
the demand for the blood protein is about 500 tons per year worldwide and @entity10 has faced worrying shortages in the past			2
the rice method was devised by scientists at @entity36 in @entity10 and colleagues from the @entity38 and the @entity39 at the @entity40 in @entity41			0
first , they genetically engineered rice seeds to produce high levels of @entity22			2
then , they worked out a way to purify the protein from the seeds , gathering about 2.75grams of the protein per 1kg ( 2.2lbs ) of rice			0
when they tested the rice - made protein in rats with liver cirrhosis , a common condition for which the human equivalent is often used , they found it produced similar outcomes to treatment with @entity22			1
medical marvel ? it is hoped the new technique will solve shortages in the production of @entity22 , which typically comes from blood donations ' it looks like an interesting technological step forward , ' dr @entity68 , chief medical officer for the @entity69 , told @entity72			1
' it could potentially produce large quantities in a reasonable time			0
the disadvantage of what we currently use is that it is a blood product , which means it could transmit infection			2
' but concerns have been raised that it could actually raise possibility of the transmission of hepatitis and @entity85 since the protein comes from human blood			0
the protein is often used in the manufacture of vaccines and drugs and is given to patients with serious burn injuries , hemorrhagic shock and liver disease , the researchers said			1
concerns : there are fears the large - scale planting of genetically modified rice fields need to produce large amounts of the protein could lead to food - supply contamination in 2007 , a shortage in @entity10 led to price spikes and a brief rise in the number of fraudulent albumin medicines on the market			0
but large - scale planting of genetically modified rice fields that could produce enough seed for mass production of the protein also raises environmental and food supply contamination concerns , since rice is a major world food staple			0
more research is needed to evaluate the safety of the rice - derived protein in animals and humans before it can be considered for the market .			0

@entity22 used to treat burns , shock and liver disease
breakthrough could solve blood shortage *crises*
