it is not only @entity1 struggling for form this term			1
click here to read the five things @entity6 can do to infiltrate the top four on @entity9 last season , @entity1 were top of the @entity12 tree			1
twelve wins from their first 18 saw them one point ahead of @entity16 , two in front of @entity18 and three above @entity6			1
this season , it ia a different story entirely			2
@entity23 's side are 6th in the @entity12 after just seven wins from their first 17 , a massive 12 points behind @entity18 at the top of the table			1
here , @entity28 look at the five things @entity1 need to do to right their wrongs , and climb into the top four of the @entity12			1
@entity31 to a lead ... @entity1 have dropped 11 points from winning positions this season and that suggests either a mental or physical weakness in the team			1
@entity23 ’s team dropped nine in total last season but there appears to be a soft underbelly this campaign , which could be explained by the rotating injury list but is still not good enough			0
the sight of @entity46 ducking at @entity47 on sunday will not have gone down well with either manager or fans			0
@entity50 is a big miss and if @entity23 does decide to buy in january , then a central defender has surely to be his first priority			0
@entity54 had his head in his hands at full - time on sunday after @entity1 squandered another lead to draw @entity58 ... when @entity59 ticks , so do @entity1			1
the winger was on the bench at @entity47 so he is getting closer			0
@entity59 provides pace , vision , finishing and is a marvellous link - up player			0
imagine if @entity59 , @entity65 and @entity66 all clicked at the same time			0
there would be sear marks on the pitch			0
@entity59 ’s intelligence also means he can adapt his role as required			0
@entity59 is back in training , and was on the bench against @entity6 on sunday what to do with @entity74 ... @entity74 likes to be the main man but the return of @entity77 means he is required out wide where his work - rate is unquestioned but where he struggles to have an influence			1
the situation is unlikely to change any time soon with fit - again @entity77 back in the goals and only really able to play as a central striker			0
so @entity23 has to get inside @entity74 ’s brain and persuade him that he can utilise his pace or play two centre forwards , which is about as likely as the manager being made a freeman of @entity90			0
the return of @entity77 means that @entity74 is required in a wide position for @entity1 @entity92 ... easily said , far harder done			1
if @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 are all fit , and @entity59 , @entity97 and @entity65 stay so , @entity1 have an abundance of midfield riches			1
but , at the moment , the only ‘ proper ’ not - injured defensive central midfielder available is @entity101 , who had a nightmare against @entity6			1
the 30 - year - old @entity103 is also a disciplinary risk			0
@entity95 , @entity94 and @entity93 can operate there but they are all occupying the physio room at present			0
@entity1 only have @entity101 fit as a ' proper ' defensive midfielder and he is a disciplinary risk stick with @entity111 ... @entity1 fans should be careful for what they wish for			2
calling for @entity23 ’s head , halfway through a season , is not the way to inspire the team to a top - four position			2
even when @entity1 win – the @entity120 springs to mind – there was a banner asking @entity23 to go			2
the obvious question is who would replace him ? knee - jerk decisions are not the @entity1 way and the sooner every fan shelves their negative feelings the better it will be for the team			2
@entity23 has been criticised by some @entity1 fans , but they need to be careful what they wish for video we could n't find our flow - @entity23			2

last season , @entity1 were top of the @entity12 on @entity9
this season , they are 6th in the league table going into the *festive* period
