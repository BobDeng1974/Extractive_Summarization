it has laid largely unstudied in a university library for more than 100 years			0
but now a 1,500 - year - old papyrus has been identified as one of the world ’s earliest surviving @entity5 charms			1
the ‘ remarkable ’ document contains some of the earliest documented references to @entity10 and sheds new light on early @entity5 practices , experts say			1
a magical find : a 1,500 - year - old papyrus has been identified as one of the world ’s earliest surviving @entity5 charms ( pictured ) and experts believe it sheds light on early @entity5 practices the document was rediscovered in the @entity21 ’s @entity20			1
it is the earliest surviving document to use the @entity24 liturgy - which describes @entity10 - as a protective charm			1
the ‘ magical ’ words are written on a recycled piece of papyrus , which was originally used as a grain tax receipt			1
dr @entity30 , a @entity31 of the @entity20 , came across the @entity33 ‘ amulet ’ while trawling through thousands of fragments of unpublished historical documents that are kept inside the library ’s vaults			2
the charm is written on a recycled piece of papyrus , which was originally used as a grain tax receipt ( pictured )			1
dr @entity30 used spectral imaging techniques to reveal that the charm was written on used material the full text of the papyrus reads : ' fear you all who rule over the earth			0
' know you nations and peoples that @entity53 is our @entity54			0
' for he spoke and they came to being , he commanded and they were created ; he put everything under our feet and delivered us from the wish of our enemies			0
' our @entity54 prepared a sacred table in the desert for the people and gave manna of the new covenant to eat , the @entity69 ’s immortal body and the blood of @entity53 poured for us in remission of sins			0
' she believes that the charm casts important new light on early @entity5 - just 300 years after the roman emperor @entity76 converted to the religion			2
it shows how @entity79 adopted the ancient @entity81 practice of wearing amulets to protect the wearer against dangers			1
this practice of writing charms on pieces of papyrus was continued by the @entity79 who replaced the prayers to @entity81 and @entity91 gods with extracts from the @entity93			1
dr @entity30 used spectral imaging techniques to reveal that the charm was written on recycled papyrus			0
faint lettering on the back of the charm is thought to be a receipt for the payment of grain tax which was certified by a tax collector from the village of @entity106 , outside the ancient city of @entity108 , in modern @entity108			1
dr @entity30 explained : ‘ the amulet maker would have cut a piece of the receipt , written the charm on the other side and then he would have folded the papyrus to be kept in a locket or pendant			2
it is for this reason the tax receipt on the exterior was damaged and faded away			2
’ the document had been held at the library since 1901 , but no - one had realised its significance			0

an image of @entity143 's famous mural is pictured the papyrus contains some of the earliest documented references to @entity10			1
it is also one of the first recorded documents to use magic in the @entity5 context			0
it would have been folded up inside a locket or pendant , worn by someone in the hope it protected them			2

this practice of writing charms on pieces of papyrus was continued by the @entity79 who replaced the prayers to @entity81 and @entity91 gods with extracts from the @entity93			1
the papyrus also shows the extent to which @entity5 had spread in @entity172 1,500 years ago			2
the charm would have been worn by an ordinary person - probably not a priest			0
some @entity79 still use passages from the @entity93 as protective charms , so the amulet marks the beginning of a trend in @entity5			1
dr @entity30 said : ‘ this is an important and unexpected discovery as it ’s one of the first recorded documents to use magic in the @entity5 context and the first charm ever found to refer to the @entity188 - the last supper - as the manna of the @entity190			2
the text of the amulet is a combination of biblical passages including @entity194 78:23 - 24 and @entity195 among others			0
it includes the words : ‘ our @entity54 prepared a sacred table in the desert for the people and gave manna of the new covenant to eat , the @entity69 ’s immortal body and the blood of @entity53 poured for us in remission of sins			0
’ dr @entity30 said that some @entity79 still use passages from the @entity93 as protective charms , so the amulet marks the beginning of a trend in @entity5			1
‘ though we know almost nothing about the owner of the charm , we think it could have been owned by a resident of the village nearby @entity108 ( @entity108 ) , ’ she said			0
‘ we can say this is an incredibly rare example of @entity5 and the @entity93 becoming meaningful to ordinary people - not just priests and the elite			2
‘ it ’s doubly fascinating because the amulet maker clearly knew the @entity93 , but made lots of mistakes : some words are misspelled and others are in the wrong order			0
this suggests that he was writing by heart rather than copying it			0
‘ it ’s quite exciting			0
thanks to this discovery , we now think that the knowledge of the @entity93 was more embedded in sixth century @entity172 than we previously realised			0
