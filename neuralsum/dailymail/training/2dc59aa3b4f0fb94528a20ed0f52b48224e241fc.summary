cast member @entity29 , however , has taken preparation for the overseas trip one step further by spending two days in @entity34 's @entity33 conquering his fear of flying			1
' @entity3 elite : @entity29 joined @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 for filming in @entity7 last year the 24 - year - old hairdresser has hated flying since a child			1

he said : ' the beach outfits are planned , sunglasses collection ready to be showcased and the tan applied but having to fly has always put a dark cloud over the whole holiday			0
' sitting at the airport gate i have always been the one looking nervously out on the runway biting my nails			0
for me it ’s the noises			0
i sit there listening to every bang and whirling , thinking it ’s a signal that we are doomed to drop out of the sky any minute ! ' all calm : @entity29 pictured on the test flight with his @entity67 @entity29 's not alone , it is estimated that one in six people are scared of flying			1
but the former party - planner , and show 's resident @entity72 , has managed to conquer his fear for good with an intensive two - day course			0

' following the course @entity29 said : ' i feel so e-mosh ! i can honestly say that this course has changed my life			1
' waking up the morning after the ground session i felt completely different ; i did n’t feel sick or anxious and was looking forward to the flight – something which i have n’t ever done			0
after 14 years of being scared of flying i now realise i was only scared of the air con noises ! i only wish i had come on this sooner			2
' all ready for @entity103			0
' nervous : @entity29 could n't hide his nerves when travelling to @entity117 in 2013 next to cast member @entity40 @entity29 's co-star @entity118 confirmed that the show was heading there last month in an interview with @entity122			1
