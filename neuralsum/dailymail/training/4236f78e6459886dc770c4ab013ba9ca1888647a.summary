footage of @entity9 , 19 , shows the woman walking into an @entity12 supermarket in @entity13 , @entity14 , in a beige trench coat			1
she walks around the store before coming to a stop in the fruit and vegetable aisle - and then takes a can of @entity21 from her pocket			1
she then downs the can of beer in front of shocked shoppers			0
the act was captured on film by a giggling friend - who at the end of the footage nominates three more friends to take part			1
speaking with @entity43 , miss @entity9 said : ' i just found an aisle and tried to drink it before security came over			2
' people were just looking at me like " what on earth are you doing ? " ' i did n't want to do it at first but then i thought i should just have fun			0
' @entity9 pictured wearing her beige coat in the @entity56 ( left ) removes her clothing ( right ) the teen totters around wearing only her underwear while holding the can of @entity21 ' everyone will go as far as they want to , nobody is forcing anyone to do anything			2
' @entity7 is an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or ' neck ' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours			1
participants often upload the footage onto the internet			0
in some instances , teens can be seen downing ' dirty pints ' - or concoctions of alcohol and other substances - or large amounts of strong spirits as part of the dare			1
last week , footage of one young man from @entity87 drinking a live goldfish as part of the craze			2
the girl 's friend , who 'd been filming the dare , then nominates three others to take part in the challenge miss @entity9 said she did n't want to do it at first , but then thought ' i should just have fun ' the teen added she downed the drink as quickly as she could before security arrived the act is often done in bizarre and dangerous circumstances - such as @entity105 , 18 , who downed a mixture of wine and gin before plunging in to a freezing harbour			1
the craze started in @entity111 last month and has now swept the globe - with thousands of @entity114 youngsters taking part			1
last weekend two young men died in @entity117 as a result of taking part			0
@entity120 , 22 , was found unconscious in a house in @entity122 in the early hours of saturday morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death			0
hours later , the body of @entity130 , 19 , was discovered floating in the river at @entity132 in @entity133 after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination			2
the game has been condemned by experts			0
dr @entity138 , medical adviser to alcohol education charity @entity139 , said : ' young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in , but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise			0
' quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess , there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the ' cyber shame ' some young people may experience			0
' @entity139 research shows nearly half of 18 to 24 - year - olds admitted ' un-tagging ' drunk photos of themselves on @entity162 that they did n't want others to see			0
