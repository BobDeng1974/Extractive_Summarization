by @entity0 published : 08:59 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 21 june 2013 the @entity2 is a plastic container with a lid that locks into place for a set length of time , depending on the desired setting			1
the plastic box will only open when the countdown has ended a chocolate - mad designer from @entity12 has invented a clever contraption to stop weak - willed dieters dipping into the biscuits and crisps			2
the @entity2 is a plastic container with a lid that locks into place using small prongs			1
the lid stays locked for a set length of time - from one minute up to 10 days - and ca n't be opened until the timer runs down			1
it was designed by 39 - year - old @entity26			2
@entity26 said he would often ask his wife @entity27 to hide junk food in the house so he could try and stick to a healthy diet and resist temptation			2
but he was unable to ignore his sweet tooth and always found himself hunting down the sugary snacks and binge eating			0
eventually the 39 - year - old came up with an innovative idea that would keep his favourite treats locked away until after dinner			1
to curb his cravings @entity40 places cookies , chocolates , sweets or crisps into the box and enters the desired time setting			0
the plastic box will then only open when the countdown has ended - even removing the batteries wo n't release the lid			1
the only other way to get into the box is to physically smash it , added @entity26 , although users are given a five - second window to correct the timer if they make a mistake			1
the @entity2 is currently being listed on @entity58 , a website where members of the public can donate money to new products and ideas to get them manufactured			1
if it reaches the £ 19,400 target , @entity26 plans to ship it by september for £ 18			0
use the safe for things which might distract you from something			0
locking up your @entity71 will eliminate the distraction , and putting video games controllers out of reach will encourage children to do their homework they 've thought of everything : the @entity2 , left , can not be opened before a set time without actually breaking it			1
however , if you set the timer wrong you get five seconds to cancel it before it locks			1
other items including keys and gadgets can be locked away from children , for example , right @entity40 said : ' it all started when i was a student and would come home and eat snacks			1
' if it was in the house , i would eat it all			2
i would get my wife to hide food from me but i always searched the house and found it			2
' there are a lot of weight issues in the @entity102 so i thought other people might have a problem with this too , and found a way to solve it			0
' you hear about bank safes which ca n’t open until a certain hour so i thought of that concept			0
the kitchen safe has been listed on @entity58 in an effort to raise funding for manufacturing			0
if they reach the £ 19,400 target , the designer @entity26 expects it to go on sale before september this year for £ 18 ' @entity119 physically can not be opened when the lid is shut			0
' in a prototype i had a way you could re-set it by taking out the batteries but it defeated the point			0
' when i first started using it i wished it would just open but then i thought ‘ ok , i will just have to have an apple or a carrot or something ’			0
' you can also put things in it like @entity71 , which might distract you from something and video games controllers to encourage kids to do their homework			0

the ' @entity2 ' locks tempting foods away so you ca n't eat them
food can be locked away for one minute up to to 10 days
it ca n't be opened before the timer is up - even by removing the batteries
