she said : ‘ [ it could be used for ] some future get back at me			2
bribery , blackmail – we need the blackmail music do n’t we			0
’ last night one @entity37 said he was ‘ disgusted ’ by the comments that had ‘ no place in front line politics ’			2
mrs @entity7 , 54 , became a high - profile recruit to @entity1 when she confronted @entity42 during this year ’s @entity27 conference and told him she was leaving the party			1
she has been called a ‘ trusted ally ’ of @entity1 leader @entity29 , so her comments will come as a blow to the party following a year of controversies			1
earlier this year , mep @entity50 provoked anger after referring to ‘ @entity52 ’ in a speech about foreign aid			0
he later resigned from the party after he called some female activists ‘ sluts ’			0
mr @entity29 last night said that mrs @entity7 ’s comments were ‘ slightly odd ’			1
he added : ‘ i have met her two or three times and i have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party			0
‘ i had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours			0
while this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears			1
’ defiant : video filmed by mrs @entity7 's ex-husband @entity74 in 2008 and last night she said she stood by her comments controversial : the 20 - minute video was shot to promote her political career @entity1 want to end ‘ mass , uncontrolled immigration ’ but does not call for repatriation of legal immigrants			1

mrs @entity7 ’s husband , @entity74 , from whom she has since divorced , helped shoot the footage to promote her political career			1
in one take , she said : ‘ we must basically repatriate those that should n’t be here			0
that ’s not quite policy yet			0
maybe i should soften it a bit			0
’ she then added : ‘ ok			0
’ @entity74 is then heard to mutter : ‘ @entity95			0
’ in the very next take , mrs @entity7 – a @entity96 councillor and deputy leader of the local @entity1 party – says : ‘ multiculturalism is dead , i ’m allowed to say that , but maybe @entity102 is waving the @entity95 flag a bit			1
‘ we must control immigration			0
we can not sustain the numbers coming in ; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous			0
control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in @entity110 and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak @entity113 so they can integrate			0
’ she adds : ‘ i just want to send the lot back but i ca n’t say that			1
’ last night , mrs @entity7 insisted her comments were taken ‘ out of context ’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants			1
' multiculturalism is dead ' : mrs @entity7 references the @entity95 during the video ' complete opportunism ' : mr @entity123 said the video was in the public interest as she tries to become an mp or @entity126 she said : ‘ it is nothing different from what the home secretary is advocating now any way			1
and the blackmail music is from a @entity135 sketch			0
i do n’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect			1
’ ‘ i stand by what i said : illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism wo n’t work			1
it was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context			0
’ speaking about the footage , mr @entity123 said : ‘ @entity7 said during the divorce she would never be entering national politics again			1
now , with her being a rising star of @entity1 , i think it is a public interest story in terms of the electorate knowing what kind of a woman she is			1
’ ‘ i remember remarking that [ her comment ] was a little bit @entity95 and she replied that we should send them back			1
i was n’t shocked as she ’s like that all the time			0
’ ‘ @entity160 will do anything to further her political career			0
she felt she was passed over by the @entity9 , that ’s why she defected			0
she has a better chance of being an mp or @entity126 with @entity1			1
it is complete opportunism , power at all costs			0
’ mrs @entity7 was within 714 votes of becoming @entity27 mp for @entity169 at the 2010 election , and since joining @entity1 has enjoyed a high profile			1
' trusted ally ' : @entity1 insiders said mrs @entity7 was ' fast - tracked ' for a council seat one insider said she was a ‘ trusted ally ’ of mr @entity29 : ‘ she was fast - tracked for a council seat and then went on the @entity179 politics show			1

last night , local mp @entity214 , said : ‘ immigration is a huge issue			0
but anyone who says they “ just want to send the lot back ” has no place at all in frontline politics			1
‘ people who have come here to work hard , to live by @entity5 values and to contribute to our communities have always been welcomed			2
[ @entity226 ] will be as disgusted as i am by the views which mrs @entity7 apparently holds			2
’ @entity229 - born @entity27 mp @entity228 called on miss @entity230 to ‘ retract her deeply damaging comments ’ , adding : ‘ hard - working immigrants contribute significantly to the @entity5			1
