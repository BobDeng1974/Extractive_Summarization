thankful : @entity0 is a pancreatic cancer survivor who owes her life to a locum gp @entity0 was bent double with crippling pains under her ribcage when she went to her gp			1
‘ i ’d already been to the practice three times in as many weeks because it was so intense , ’ recalls @entity0 , 47 , a former geochemist who lives with her husband @entity11 , 49 , a financial it director , and their two sons , @entity14 , 19 , and @entity15 , 16 , in @entity16 , @entity17			1
‘ the pains had started in the centre of my back above my bra strap four weeks earlier			0
i could n’t sit back in a chair or get comfortable in bed			0
‘ there was no lump sticking out as such , but it felt like i had a tennis ball in between my shoulder blades			0
the pain gradually moved round to my front under my rib cage and was much worse after i ’d eaten			0
‘ i completely went off food and lost a stone in just a few weeks			0
i was also suffering from bouts of diarrhoea which i ’d never had before			0
’ one of the regular gps told her she had indigestion and prescribed the antacid @entity40			1
when the pain got worse and @entity0 went back a week later , she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and prescribed an anti-spasmodic drug			1
on her third visit , @entity0 told a third gp the pain had shifted from her back to under her ribcage			1
he said it was probably stomach irritation caused by the anti-inflammatory painkillers she ’d been prescribed previously , and gave her codeine instead			0
‘ but this did n’t touch the pain , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ on my fourth visit , i saw a locum gp			1
she was a lot more thorough than the other doctors had been and asked me lots of detailed questions			0
she even phoned the local hospital ’s @entity61 surgical specialist to get a second opinion			1
‘ i sensed the locum had a hunch it was something serious , as she urged me to go to @entity61 if the pain worsened			0
’ she went to @entity61 , but it was a @entity69 and no scans were being done			0
@entity0 was sent back to the gp			1
‘ i saw the same locum again and she looked very concerned and insisted i needed an urgent referral			0
she referred me to a pancreatic surgeon , which probably saved my life			1
had i been sent to a different type of specialist , such as a gastroenterologist , it might have been too late			2
’ young doctor : the locum gp who helped @entity0 solved her health problems despite her inexperience , and referred her to a specialist who saved her scans taken two days later by the specialist revealed a 5cm cancerous tumour in the middle of @entity0 ’s pancreas			1
she had been just weeks away from being inoperable as the tumour was growing next to major blood vessels			0
‘ i ’m alive five - and - a - half years later because a locum made the right call			2
my own @entity82 admitted to me after my surgery that he ’d never have picked up my cancer because i was young and otherwise healthy , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ you hear so many negative things about locums missing things — but i think the fact that i was seen by someone who was looking at me through a fresh pair of eyes , and who was perhaps more up - to - date in their knowledge , saved my life			1
’ detailed questions : mrs @entity113 said that her own gp admitted after the surgery that he would never have picked up on the cancer because she was otherwise healthy there are an estimated 15,000 gps working as locums in the @entity120			1
they make up a quarter of the general practice workforce and see 36 million patients a year			1
a locum is a fully qualified doctor who provides temporary cover to fill a vacancy or cover sick leave , staff holidays or training commitments			0
many newly qualified doctors work as locums to gain experience			2
there are also older doctors who want more flexibility and doctors from overseas , as well as retired doctors , who take up locum posts			0
‘ i ’ve seen a jump in the number of @entity82 partners leaving their regular practices mid-career to become locums , mostly from the sheer burden of extra paperwork and clinics they have to do , ’ says dr @entity149 , a @entity82 locum and chief executive of the @entity152			1
‘ also , many more gps these days are female			0
working freelance as a locum can offer those with families a much better work - life balance			1
’ however , even though locums are trained to the same level as other doctors , many people are unwilling to see the ‘ stand - in ’			1
this is partly because locums tend to make the headlines only when things go wrong			1
for instance , @entity169 gp locum dr @entity168 was struck off by the @entity171 in 2010 after being found guilty of serious clinical failings			2
one of his patients was given a fatal tenfold overdose of diamorphine			0
while the @entity171 does n’t collect figures about complaints against @entity82 locums , experts say public perception is that numbers are high			2
‘ this idea that locums are somehow second - rate doctors is unfair , ’ says dr fieldhouse			1
‘ i hear so much about patients wanting continuity of care — which is true — but with continuity can sometimes come complacency			0
if a gp is seeing a patient repeatedly about a problem , it can sometimes be hard to spot what is wrong because the changes creep up over time			2
‘ a locum might walk in and spot it straight away			0
they may also find it easier to say difficult things such as the patient needs to lose weight or give up smoking			0
’ dr @entity204 , deputy chairman of the @entity206 ’s @entity205 , agrees that sometimes seeing a different doctor , whether from within the practice or elsewhere , can be a good thing			2
medical students : mrs @entity113 says she owes her life to a keen locum gp fresh out of studying but he adds : ‘ the patient does n’t have the same relationship of trust with a locum that they have with their family doctors and if a consultation does n’t go the way they were expecting , they can be more likely to make a complaint			1
’ @entity224 , a surgeon and chair of the @entity226 ’ @entity152 , a professional body representing 4,000 locums , says stand - in doctors are often subject to more rigorous scrutiny than regular gps			1
‘ locums have to prove themselves in every job			2
when you start a new post , all the other staff eye your work through the microscope			0
if any slight mistake is made , it creates immediate alarm			0
’ miss @entity224 says a locum ’s varied experience can stand them in good stead			0
‘ i know one locum who , because of his wide experience in different general practices , was able to spot an adverse drug reaction when the patient ’s own doctor failed to do so			2
’ like @entity0 , @entity255 , 28 , a charity worker from @entity256 , also owes her life to a newly qualified doctor at a university practice			1
‘ i saw my family gp in @entity260 several times over a period of a year about a mole that had appeared in the middle of my back			2
it was getting bigger , it was raised and was changing colour and i worried about it constantly , ’ says @entity255			0
‘ but he just kept saying it was nothing to worry about and sent me away repeatedly			0
when i started university in @entity270 , i went to the university practice and saw a locum gp			1
shortage : an estimated 15,000 gps are working as locums in the @entity120 , seeing 36million patients a year ‘ far from fobbing me off as my gp had done previously , this doctor took one look at it and made an urgent referral for me to see a dermatologist			1
‘ a week later , i was seen by the specialist who told me that it was malignant melanoma — the worst and most aggressive type of skin cancer			2
’ @entity255 had her operation to remove the cancerous mole a week later — luckily before the cancer could spread to other parts of the body			0
‘ it was the vigilance of the locum doctor that made that timely referral			0
‘ my gp was older , in his 50s , and had practised in a small rural town — maybe he had just got complacent and too set in his ways			2
’ @entity0 has since made a full recovery and set up the charity @entity301			1
‘ i never saw that locum doctor again — but it ’s because of her being so diligent and making the referral to exactly the right specialist that i ’m still here today			2
‘ i owe her a big thank you			0
seeing a locum really did save my life			2

@entity0 , 47 , was mistakenly diagnosed with @entity313 by her regular gp
@entity317 referred mrs stunt to life - saving specialist who operated immediately
locums make up a quarter of the general practice workforce in @entity120
