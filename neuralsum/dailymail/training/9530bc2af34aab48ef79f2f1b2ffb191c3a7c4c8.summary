we all know that panic - stricken moment			0
you drop your mobile and watch , aghast , as it plunges towards the floor , fearing it will land screen - side down – with shattering consequences			2
but now @entity8 plans to spare you that agony , with an invention that will stop your @entity12 hitting the ground face - first			1
the technology giant was granted a patent last week on an invention that can detect when a handset is falling – and flips it to ensure the screen does n’t hit the ground			1
the idea could also work with @entity22 and other devices			2
@entity8 was granted a patent last week for the invention that shifts an internal weight in the device in mid-air so it does n't hit the ground face first on impact			1
industry experts point out that a prototype has yet to be tested @entity8 ’s design features on - board sensors that measure the speed that the phone is falling and predict when it will land and which side of the device will hit the floor			1
if sensors calculate a delicate component , such as the screen or camera , will hit the ground , a motor is instantly activated within the phone			1
this moves an internal weight fast enough to affect the ‘ rotational velocity ’ of the device and spin it around as it falls , so that it lands on a reinforced area			1
the effect is similar to how a falling cat always manages to land on its feet			0
and that ’s not all			0
the patent even includes a system that would eject the headphone cord to avoid damage to the connector			0
@entity64 , a lecturer in science entrepreneurship at @entity66 , said : ‘ this does what a lot of successful innovations do : combines ideas in a way others had not considered , such as adding gyroscopic action within a smartphone			0
‘ but integrating this idea into current slimline designs may be a challenge			0
of course , no one will really know the possible benefits and limitations until @entity8 gets prototypes into the hands of users – hands that are indeed sometimes clumsy			2
’ industry insiders say an @entity12 featuring the new technology may appear within three years .			0

sensors predict speed of device in mid-air so it does n't hit ground face first
a motor shifts internal weight and spins the phone to land on its hard area
tech giant granted patent for invention that could also work with @entity22
@entity8 has yet to get a prototype into hands of users for a real - life test run
