fewer than one in five @entity2 residents want @entity4 bomber @entity3 to be executed believing a quick death would be ' too easy an escape '			1
@entity3 , who killed three people and injured 260 others in the april , 2013 bombings , is due back in court today where his defence team will begin to make its case			1
last week prosecutors described the 21 - year - old as ' @entity17 's worst nightmare ' insisting he deserves to die for carrying out one of the bloodiest attacks on @entity17 soil since 9/11			2
fewer than one in five @entity2 residents believe @entity4 bomber @entity3 , seen here gesturing at his jail cell camera while awaiting trial , should be handed a death penalty however a poll for the @entity28 newspaper found less than 20 per cent of @entity2 residents questioned believed he should be put to death with 63 per cent in favour of a life sentence			1
and in the city of @entity34 itself the figure falls to just 15 per cent of residents in favour of the death penalty and 66 per cent arguing he should be caged for life			1
@entity38 , president of @entity39 , which conducted the poll on behalf of the @entity28 said : ' it seems that voters have concluded that @entity3 does not deserve a quick death , but rather should spend the remainder of his days in a windowless cell contemplating the heinous acts that put him there			1
' to voters , it would seem death is too easy an escape			0
' if he does escape the death penalty , @entity3 is likely to spend the rest of his days in one of @entity17 's @entity57 prisons where inmates are kept mainly in solitary confinement and have minimal contact with staff or fellow prisoners			1
last week protesters demonstrated against the death penalty outside the courthouse holding up banners , one of which read : ' why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong ? ' jurors were selected in part for their openness to imposing the death penalty , controversial in a state that has executed no one since 1947 and where catholic bishops oppose capital punishment			1
evidence photos from the @entity81 trial revealed the aftermath of the blasts			0
three people were killed and 260 others injured in the attacks on april 15 , 2013 an earlier poll carried out by @entity88 found that just over half of @entity17 ( 53 per cent ) , said @entity3 should get the death penalty			1
forty - five per cent said he should spend the rest of his life behind bars			0
if just one juror accepts there were mitigating circumstances to @entity3 's actions , then he will be sentenced to life in prison			2
@entity3 has already been convicted of 30 federal charges in the twin bombings near the marathon 's finish line on april 15 , 2013			0
seventeen of those charges carry the possibility of the death penalty			1
his defense team is set to begin presenting witnesses today in the penalty phase of his trial - the stage that will determine whether he is executed or spends the rest of his life behind bars			2
his lawyers ' primary task will be to humanize @entity3 and undermine prosecutors ' depiction of him as a ruthless and heartless terrorist who placed a bomb just feet from a group of children and targeted the marathon for maximum bloodshed			2
victim : last week the court heard how @entity127 , 8 , suffered a slow and painful death in the trial 's first phase , the defense tried to show that at the time of the attacks , @entity3 was a 19 - year - old college student flunking out of school and heavily influenced by his radicalized older brother , @entity135 , 26			1
the defense likely is to continue emphasizing that theme , but may also focus on @entity3 's seeming aimlessness to show that he did not appear to be motivated by political concerns and that his brother was the driving force behind the attack , aimed at punishing the @entity17 for its wars in @entity145 countries			2
the witness list has not been made public , but legal experts expect the defense to call family members and friends who will describe @entity3 as a well - behaved child who appeared to adjust well to his life in the @entity17 after moving here with his parents and siblings from @entity156 about a decade before the bombings			2
among those who have come out against the death penalty are @entity160 and @entity161 , whose eight - year - old son @entity162 was killed and seven - year - old daughter , @entity163 , lost a leg in the blasts			1
writing in the @entity28 they said : ' we understand all too well the heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed			0
' the defendant murdered our 8 - year - old son , maimed our 7 - year - old daughter , and stole part of our soul			0
' we know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives			1
' last week the trial heard from a trauma surgeon who described how the young @entity127 suffered terribly before he bled to death on the street			0
dr @entity189 , a veteran military combat surgeon , said the little boy was gravely injured in the blasts and suffered ' visceral pain '			0
@entity189 said @entity127 's liver , spleen and intestines were twisted and stretched by the blast			0
the surgeon , who works at @entity198 , said @entity127 's death would have been intensely painful due to the severe injuries to his internal organs			0
' he did not die instantaneously , ' the surgeon said , noting that internal injuries activate a set of pain receptors that call ' a much more primal , very disturbing kind of pain '			0
demonstrators against the death penalty stand outside the @entity210 during first day of the penalty phase hearing on tuesday , last week jurors were played an audio recording of the reaction of the crowd outside the @entity217 between the time of the first and second blasts and heard from some of those who suffered appalling injuries			1
@entity222 , who was one of 17 people to lose a leg , said : ' i saw smoke and started hearing people scream and immediately what came to mind was footage i had seen on 9/11 when the ( @entity232 ) buildings collapsed ... before i could even react , the second explosion occurred , ' @entity233 testified			0
' i was catapulted through the front doors of the restaurant , which were open , and i landed on the ground in a puddle of chaos and glass and blood			0
' @entity233 was one of 18 people who lost legs to the twin pressure - cooker bombs placed at the scene by @entity3 and his 26 - year - old brother , @entity135 , who died four days later after the pair shot dead a police officer			2
the jury saw pictures of all 18 amputees , many of whom testified earlier in the trial , as prosecutors presented the third and final day of their sentencing - phase case in @entity257 in @entity34			0
on tuesday , the court was shown a picture of @entity3 flipping off a surveillance camera in his cell three months after his arrest , revealing utter disdain and lack of remorse for the death and destruction he had wreaked			1

@entity3 , 21 , back in court today for start of defence case
prosecutors last week urged jurors to push for the death penalty
but poll finds *majority* of @entity2 residents want life *imprisonment*
defence expected to *suggest* @entity3 was led astray by his older brother
