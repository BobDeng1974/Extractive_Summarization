dr. @entity0 drew shouts of ' run , @entity3 , @entity4 ' friday night with a double - barreled attack on the @entity7 presidency that included slams on his foreign policy decisions			1
the retired pediatric neurosurgeon , who has attracted a cult - like @entity12 following – and a presidential ' draft ' committee with better fundraising numbers than the ' @entity16 , that the @entity17 need n't ' stick our nose into everybody 's business , but we do need to lead			1
' ' we are the pinnacle nation of the world , ' he told a crowd of thousands at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
' there 's a responsibility that comes with that , and right now the world is like a third - grade class with no teacher in it			1
and it 's going like crazy , okay ? ' dr. @entity0 is being prodded to run for president by a pac that has outraised the ' @entity40 ' group that 's advocating for former secretary of state @entity41 @entity0 said his observations were mostly reflective of the @entity7 administration 's failure to understand @entity46 history and intervene on the side of groups and nations that held promise to become @entity17 allies			1
like former secretary of state @entity41 , he may or may not be running for the @entity52 in 2016			0
but he acknowledged the growing chorus of fans who want him to take the plunge			0
' there are a lot of people who come up to me and say , " doctor , you 've got ta run			0
you 've got ta save us " , ' he said quietly			0
' there are a lot of people who do that			0
' @entity0 also knows how leverage his quiet charisma to appeal to red - meat conservatives			2
' our country is in critical condition right now , ' the doctor said			0
' and if do n't do something about it in the relatively near future			0
it 's going to be over			2
' if @entity80 presidents can appoint three more liberal @entity82 justices , @entity0 warned , it ' is the end of the @entity17 as we know it			1
' he raised eyebrows with prescriptions to combat illegal immigration that included the use of unmanned aircraft to patrol the @entity17 - @entity90 border			1
under @entity7 's leadership , he said , ' we do n't have the will to secure the border			1
we have what we need to do that			0
you know , we have all kinds of technological things			0
' crowd favorites : live - action painter @entity100 splashed his way to a canvas of dr. @entity0 in front of a crowd of 3,000 saturday night , a day after @entity0 spoke at the same event he also hinted that entitlements and the promise of free education and other social programs are a electromagnet for border - crossings that should be switched off			1
' we have to reduce the incentive for people to want to come here , ' he said			0
' i guarantee you that if you remove all the goodies , people will find a way to get out of here just as they found a way to get in			2
' and employers who hire illegal immigrants , @entity0 told his partisan audience , should be prosecuted criminally upon a second offense			1
conceding that immigrant workers often perform jobs that ' @entity17 sometimes do n't want to do , ' he said a solution would involve an expanded guest worker program for which applications would only be accepted if they came from outside the @entity17			1
' there 's no way that we can put people in line to become @entity17 citizens and enjoy the benefits of @entity17 who have broken the law , ' he said , ' and put them in front of people who have not broken the law			1
that does n't make any sense			0
' the ' @entity147 ' committee , a group laying the groundwork for a @entity0 candidacy , reported last week that it raised $ 3.4 million in the second quarter of 2014			1
that amount eclipses the more media - savvy ' ready for @entity41 ' campaign , which raised $ 2.5 million in seed money for a @entity41 run			1
the @entity158 's under - the - radar approach , attracting thousands of small - dollar donations , lines up with @entity0 's own quiet approach			2
@entity0 was the biggest draw and friday night 's final speaker at the @entity26 in @entity27 in order to combat what he called a federal government that 's ' just too big , ' @entity0 steered clear of calling for the aggressive , slashing elimination of entire cabinet agencies			1
instead , he said , federal bureaucracies can be brought to heel passively , through attrition , by a four - year freeze on hiring employees to replace government workers when they retire			2
after four years – coincidentally the length of a presidential term – ' the government will be down to a lean , mean size , ' he said			0
' they will only have enough personnel to do what they 're supposed to do , and they 'll keep their big noses out of everybody 's business			2
' he did propose adding a new government department , ' a covert agency , ' tasked with monitoring government workers and programs			0
' and people who were irresponsible , lazy and unresponsive would find themselves with no job			0
that 's the way it ought to be done			2
' and overgrown government , he said , feeds off of ' absurd taxation policies ' that amount to ' government 's boot on the neck of business and industry			2
' ' people go into business to make money , ' @entity0 said , ' not to support the government			0
' ' we 've got ta get the @entity52 , and we can turn this thing right around			0

retired pediatric neurosurgeon said the @entity17 is ' the pinnacle nation of the world ; there 's a responsibility that comes with that '
he told the @entity26 that a @entity82 with three more liberal justices ' is the end of the @entity17 as we know it '
recommended using drones to monitor the @entity17 - @entity90 border and eliminating ' all the goodies ' illegal immigrants receive from @entity222
said a guest worker program should supply labor for *understaffed* jobs , but *insisted* foreign nationals should have to apply from outside the @entity17
the ' @entity147 ' committee raised $ 3.4 million in the last *fiscal* quarter , *compared* with $ 2.5 million for the ' @entity231
