@entity0 played their best football of the tournament so far in beating @entity4 on friday but i fear the semi-final on tuesday in @entity7 against @entity8 will be as far as they go			1
at this point , and based on all the evidence we ’ve seen so far , @entity8 are now favourites to win this @entity14			2
the @entity8 - @entity16 match was , to put it bluntly , largely boring			1
@entity16 missed that l bit of spark that the absent @entity20 could have provided to tee up @entity21 or someone else			2
step too far : @entity0 may struggle to defeat @entity8 in their @entity24 semi-final @entity8 looked efficient , and i mean that in an admiring way , not a cliched reference to good organisation			1
@entity29 did very well to head the opener and he and @entity31 went on to give the two best performances in the team			0
@entity8 looked completely comfortable , totally in control after taking the lead , squeezing the life out of the game the longer it went on			1
they exude the kind of calm that comes with experience , and that will be vital from here			0
@entity0 did better than in any previous match - but then that ’s not saying much			2
@entity45 and @entity46 were both excellent but now @entity0 will be without @entity45 and @entity47 for the next match and that ’s a big blow			2
celebrate : @entity0 defeated @entity4 2 - 0 to put themselves into the semi-finals they need to play better , dramatically better , and yet will have to do so minus their two best players			1
i ca n’t see it			0
they also got lucky against @entity4 because of a referee who let them get away with murder			2
how does @entity61 get booked for his first or second foul when @entity63 went unpunished for five or six offences ? @entity61 has been the star of this @entity14 : six goals , lots of assists , showing a desire for the ball and a will to make things happen that makes you purr as a fan			0
strong : based on the evidence we 've seen so far , @entity8 must be favourites to win the @entity14 power : @entity29 did brilliantly to head home the winner against @entity16 he should be treasured and treated fairly			1
the referees ’ leniency towards @entity0 has got to stop			0
i ’ve written enough times about @entity0 ’s dodgy defence , which has attacking flair when it needs solidity			1
this is where they ’ll get undone			0
i believe @entity8 will win with their runners — @entity31 , @entity93 and @entity94 — finding the spaces behind the full - backs and between @entity0 ’s defence and midfield			1
they ’ll cause problems , big problems			0
tough : @entity61 was the star of the @entity14 but was almost kicked out of the game by @entity0 to celebrate the @entity14 , i ’ve added a special @entity103 to my fashion range , incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and with a share of the proceeds going to charity			0

@entity0 *'s* weak defence may be their *downfall* against @entity8
