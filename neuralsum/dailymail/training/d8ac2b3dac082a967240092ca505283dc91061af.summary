the chairman of @entity1 has urged the wider @entity3 support to take on @entity4 – after his firm sold its 16 per cent stake in the club to three wealthy businessman			1
the @entity11 investment firm ’s chief @entity9 confirmed he had completed a deal with @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in order to halt @entity4 ’s @entity18 takeover			1
he also accused chairman @entity19 of being a ‘ wet fish ’ and admitted his disillusionment with the ruling @entity18 regime after @entity23 , @entity24 ’s man on the board , decided to quit earlier this month			2
@entity4 's plans to take further control at @entity3 have been stymied by @entity29 rules on dual interest the decision to sell 13.3million shares to the men dubbed the @entity34 is widely seen as an attack on the @entity4 ’s iron grip of @entity3			1
@entity37 believes the billionaire @entity40 tycoon can only be stopped from inside the @entity18 boardroom			0
‘ i sold because a fans - based group were hopefully going to be the best placed to take on @entity4 ’s power , ’ @entity9 stated			1
‘ after @entity4 removed @entity23 , @entity4 ’s most vocal critic , it was obvious @entity19 was just a wet fish agreeing anything @entity4 wanted			1
‘ i am sure the @entity34 are an upgrade on us for fans and hopefully this is the start of the ownership being in the right hands			0
’ @entity54 understands that club legends @entity55 and @entity57 – who hold a combined stake of around two per cent - and a myriad of fans with 10 per cent are firmly behind the @entity34 ’ move			2
@entity62 ( left ) , pictured at @entity63 on december 27 , has offered a cautious welcome to investment a day of high drama in the @entity18 power game took a dramatic twist shortly after trading began on wednesday morning when the three wealthy supporters snapped up 16 per cent of the club			0
the £ 2.6m deal sees @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 become the biggest single shareholders in the club with close to 20 per cent of the equity			1
a stock market announcement has yet to confirm the precise identity of the buyers and sellers with official notification unlikely before friday			0
but sources claim bus tycoon @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are the purchasers after they announced plans for a £ 6.5m investment last week			1
last week the three offered to buy up all the new stock issued in a pending fresh share issue			0
existing shareholders will be given first refusal – and by purchasing @entity24 ’s stake the three will now be guaranteed a chance to up their stake when new shares are sold			1
the development has all the hallmarks of a game - changer in the battle for control of the @entity18 boardroom			0
although wednesday 's purchase does not automatically mean boardroom representation for the three , significantly they are now in a position to call an egm			2
if enough support can be gathered from other factions , potentially they could now seek the removal and appointment of directors			2
the development will be seen a threat to the grip @entity4 and the @entity117 brothers presently have on the club			1
although @entity117 stated on tuesday that he would be open for talks with the @entity34 , the chairman of the football board was believed to be referring to an investment as opposed to the kind of power grab witnessed on wednesday			2
city sources have pointed out that that the proceeds of wednesday 's share sales will go to @entity24 rather than the football club			2
@entity133 owner @entity4 ’s plans to up his stake in the club to 29.9 per cent have been stymied by @entity29 rules on dual interest			1
last week the @entity136 , having met with @entity3 chief executive @entity137 , flatly refused to accede to a request to allow @entity4 to further increase his stake from nine per cent			1
@entity3 fans have protested outside @entity18 on numerous occasions at the running of their football club @entity4 and @entity3 have already been charged by the governing body due to perceived breaches of an agreement on boardroom control , and although the @entity148 would be entitled to ensure his existing stake is n’t diluted in the new rights issue , exceeding that percentage would guarantee another clash with officialdom			1
that situation has opened the door for @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 who could now buy circa 20 per cent of the new issue – as well as any unsold shares – to strengthen their position in the coming weeks			1
a spokesman for the consortium said they had no comment to make on wednesday night			0
but their move saw fans ownership group @entity166 witness a surge in membership after news of a shift to the @entity18 powerbase emerged			0
over 200 fans moved on wednesday morning to pledge financial support for the group ’ s aims of giving supporters a say in the club ’s running via the purchase of shares			1
@entity183 and @entity184 have already moved towards a supporter led model			0
encouraged by the emergence of the wealthy @entity3 supporters , @entity166 now hope to hold discussions with the group			1
@entity191 of @entity166 told @entity54 : ‘ we have had an unprecedented surge in membership this morning			0
‘ we have gone from 1900 members on monday to 2100 in one day			0
the surge created by a little bit of positive news tells me that a lot of people thought fan ownership was something that could only be triggered by crisis			0
@entity18 has not seen @entity206 football for a number of years as @entity3 attempt to climb the leagues ‘ that may have been what happened at @entity183 and @entity184			1
but it looks like a bit of good news can bring the fans to the table as well			0
‘ our strategy is now to wait and see what happens			0
to see who is the big shareholder and then use our members ’ permission to engage with that group			0
‘ it will be good to see who has bought these shares and have a conversation			2
‘ @entity227 would appear to have cut a deal with @entity184 supporters and whoever this is it could be that there is an opportunity now for @entity3 supporters to do something similar			2
‘ there has been division amongst the @entity3 support up until now			1
but i think the division has been created by the unknown and by fear			0
‘ for @entity3 fans this could be the moment when they say that if @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity13 have broken the back of the problem then they will put their shoulder to the wheel too			1
i hope that is the case			0
‘ it ’s an important day for @entity3 on the 44th anniversary of the @entity18 disaster now			2
‘ i hope the fans come out now and demonstrate their passion and care for the club by sending out a powerful message			0
’ the news of the @entity34 ’ investment was welcomed by the club ’s football board chairman @entity117 and his brother , plc director @entity257			0
their spokesman @entity259 said : ‘ if the reports are accurate , @entity117 and @entity257 are delighted that mr @entity262 and his friends have bought the @entity24 shares and they hope they will further invest in the club			0
‘ as we said yesterday the @entity266 and @entity267 , @entity15 and @entity14 have a common goal - the re-emergence of @entity3 as a footballing power			1

@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 have paid £ *2.6million* for three blocks of shares totalling 13.3million
the chairman of @entity1 has urged the wider @entity3 support to take on @entity4
@entity4 's plans to increase his stake have been *rebuffed* by the @entity29
