a family of four are lucky to be alive after a bedroom ceiling collapsed in their home			0
the damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the @entity10 's three bedroom property in @entity11			1
instead , they left @entity13 , his wife @entity14 and their two young children , @entity16 and @entity17 , in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with £ 17,000 of their money			1
' when it rained , water started coming in , it was raining inside our house			0
the box room caved in , the bathroom became bowed , the ceiling will fall in the children 's room			2
' the most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep			0
it collapsed where our bed used to be			0
we were n't in room at time thankfully			0
' for six months , the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they could n't afford to get the problems fixed straight away , having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch			1
@entity13 , a civil servant , said : ' the house was crumbling around us , we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity , it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm , it was miserable			1
i hated leaving @entity14 and the children like that when i had to go to work			0
' @entity13 and @entity14 had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for £ 325,000			1
the builders left the family with no roof and just tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements			2
as a result , rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse the parents say they are devastated at being ' taken for a ride '			1
it will cost £ 35,000 to repair their home as they started a family , they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children			2
when they sprung a small leak in part of the roof , they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about £ 3,000			1
but after removing all the tiles , he then told them that the roof structure was unsound so he would n't be able to re-tile			0
he suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion			1
the couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a £ 7,000 deposit for the work			1
@entity14 said : ' the first builder appeared to be trustyworthy and was very professional , very likable			0
' we did n't have time to check out the sub contractor he recommended as we were without a roof which we needed to be fixed			2
' a back view of the property shows how the garden was left looking like a rubbish tip while the house had no roof			2
the family had to live in one room for six months as they could n't afford the repairs so far the couple had paid the first builder £ 10,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it			1
after the sub contractor began to work on their home , the first builder then disappeared			1
@entity13 said : ' we heard from sub contractor that the builder 's uncle was sick in @entity143 so he was going there - we never hard from him again			1
' meanwhile , the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for £ 7,000 for materials and labour			1
but as the sub contractor got to work , the couple became suspicious about his competency			0
@entity14 said : ' he was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for			1
' that 's when we realised he was trying to take us for a ride like the first guy			0
' @entity13 added : ' when we told him it was n't acceptable , he walked off the job			2
we were left with a roof no longer salvageable			2
' shocking : the collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble daylight : with the tiles gone , the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements the couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to @entity177			1
they have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as £ 17,000 out of pocket			1
' we have lost the home we have been building over the last few years , our whole house has been destroyed , it 's been a living nightmare			1
we wish they have never knocked on our door , ' @entity187 wept			0
' i just want it fixed			0
i still ca n't believe someone would leave me my husband and our two children in so much danger			0
they did n't need to leave us in such an unsafe way			0
' but the family 's trust in humanity has been partly restored thanks to the friends , family and strangers who rallied round to help them			0
a friend set up a fundraising page so people can donate money to help the couple reach the £ 35,000 they will need to repair their home			2
unsafe : the family are devastated that they have been left to live in an unsafe home damage : a local builder @entity215 has been helping the family to clear up the mess left behind a local builder , @entity215 , has been working on the property at weekends - so far without payment - so the family have a roof over their heads again			1
he said : i wanted to help as this is my trade and they are a lovely family			0
they did n't need to do the work in the first place , they were scaremongered into it and then left with a house that 's unsafe			2
' @entity14 said : ' i feel terrible he 's coming here and we have n't paid him			0
he 's coming in trust that we will come through with money in the end			0
' @entity13 said it 's thanks to their friends , family and neighbours they have got through their ordeal			2
he said : ' we were left thinking " can we trust anyone anymore ? " and now we know we can			0
