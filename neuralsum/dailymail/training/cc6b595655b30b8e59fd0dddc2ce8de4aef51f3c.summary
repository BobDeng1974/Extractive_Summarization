by @entity1 correspondent the governor of the @entity4 @entity3 , pictured has defended the 2.5 per cent rise in interest rates the cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £ 175 a month over the next three years , homeowners were warned yesterday			1
the @entity4 suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 – five times the current level of 0.5 per cent			1
such an increase would add £ 174 a month – or £ 2,088 a year – to a typical £ 150,000 standard variable rate mortgage			2
although the move would benefit the millions of savers who have been hit by record rock - bottom rates since march 2009 , many cash - strapped households are ‘ vulnerable ’ to higher borrowing costs			1
the central bank ’s governor @entity3 said a rise of 2.5 per cent would cushion the blow because it is still half the average rate of 5 per cent seen before the financial crisis			1
there would be no fast return to pre-downturn levels , said the @entity26 , adding : ‘ the old normal is not the new normal			1
‘ the new normal is materially lower than the old normal			0
’ his comments came as a series of reports suggested the economic recovery is broadening			0
the @entity32 said gross domestic product , the total size of the economy , rose 0.8 per cent between january and march			0
business investment – which is seen as crucial to a balanced and sustainable recovery – jumped 5 per cent in just three months and was 10.6 per cent higher than a year earlier			0
a separate report by polling group @entity39 showed consumer confidence in may was at its highest level for more than nine years			2
@entity42 , of economic forecasters the @entity44 , said : ‘ it looks like the @entity47 growth engine is now firing on all cylinders			0
’ households have frequently been warned that interest rate rises are imminent as the economy strengthens			2
mr @entity3 , who was this week criticised for behaving like ‘ an unreliable boyfriend ’ for sending out mixed messages about when rates will go up , said the exact timing is not important			2
‘ the big picture is where interest rates go in the medium term , because if i am taking out a mortgage , that is what i care about , ’ he said			1
the @entity4 suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 ¿ five times the current level of 0.5 per cent mr @entity3 said 2.5 per cent rates are ‘ not inconsistent ’ with a full recovery			1
however , he said any increases will be ‘ gradual ’ and ‘ limited ’ – fearing that families struggling with mortgage repayments will harm the economy by reducing their spending			0
figures from the @entity71 yesterday also showed the emergence of a ‘ two - speed ’ housing market between @entity74 and elsewhere in the @entity47			0
average prices in the capital grew 18.5 per cent to £ 439,719 , compared with a rise of just 0.9 per cent in the @entity78 to £ 99,319 .			0

cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £ 175 a month in three years
