@entity1 manager @entity0 will try to persuade @entity2 and @entity3 to extend the centre - back 's loan deal next season - but @entity7 captain @entity6 is also among his defensive targets			1
@entity2 made his full international debut in @entity12 's 1 - 0 @entity11 qualifying victory in @entity13 on tuesday night , coming on as a substitute after @entity15 was sent off			1
the 19 - year - old also faces competition from @entity18 at @entity3 , and @entity0 would welcome another season - long loan arrangement			1
@entity1 want to keep @entity3 defender @entity2 ( left ) on loan for another season @entity7 captain @entity6 is another defensive target for @entity1 manager @entity0 but , with @entity2 due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself , there is no guarantee he will return , and certainly not in time for @entity1 's @entity29 qualifying campaign beginning in @entity30			1
so @entity0 confirmed he would look to sign a centre - back and responded to reports that former @entity33 player @entity6 was among his list of potential targets			1
' that is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that , ' @entity0 said			1
' but he 's a good player			2
' @entity0 , who spent last week watching @entity43 training before their 5 - 1 defeat in @entity46 , added : ' @entity2 is going back to @entity3 after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not			1
that is something we want , but we have to co-operate with @entity3			1
' but i think it 's good for him to stay here because hopefully we will get @entity29 qualification and that will make him even more experienced			2
' @entity2 is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can			1
but it 's playing that is the most important thing , and playing at @entity3 is very , very hard			1
if not , i think @entity1 is a good club for him			2
' @entity1 boss @entity0 has confirmed that he will ask @entity3 if he can keep @entity2 next season @entity2 rises highest to score against @entity65 at @entity66 at the beginning of last month @entity1 were involved in another loan deal this week when 18 - year - old midfielder @entity69 joined @entity70 until the summer			1
@entity69 has made 22 first - team appearances , but competition has increased recently with the signings of @entity74 and @entity75			0
' @entity70 called me and asked if we had a midfielder that could be available and @entity69 is a very , very talented player and he needs games , ' @entity0 said			2
' this was a good move for him			0
we have a lot of options in midfield and he can play until july 1 and get as much experience as possible			0
it 's a big club as well - the biggest club in @entity43 , high expectations there			0
this will give him more experience as a player and a person			0
' he was quite keen and that 's what good about @entity69 - he is so ambitious			0
he really wants to play and develop all the time			0
' he saw this as a very good move for him and i made it quite clear that it 's not as if i do n't want him - it 's just because i think it 's good for his development			0
if i was selfish , i would keep him here			0
' @entity2 , pictured celebrating a goal in august last year , is hoping to break into @entity3 's first - team when asked if more @entity105 players should experience playing abroad , @entity0 said : ' abroad or not , i 'm not sure what is best , but you have to learn a different culture , different ways of playing football , which is positive , and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment			1
' they are positive things but the most important thing is to get experience on the pitch			0
' @entity0 is hoping to get all of his players back fit from international duty ahead of their @entity120 clash at @entity121 on friday night , but @entity122 ( hamstring tendon ) and @entity124 ( ankle ) are still missing			2
' @entity122 is progressing , the same with @entity124 , but the two injuries are very hard to get right , ' @entity0 said			2
' things are going in the right direction but we have to be patient because if we start too early they will have the same injury again and we will be another two or three months			0
' we will not take any risks but hopefully they will be available before the end of the season			0
@entity122 is training half the session but still a long way to get 100 per cent			0

@entity2 has *enjoyed* a *successful* season on loan at @entity1
@entity0 will ask @entity3 about keeping him for next season
@entity7 captain @entity6 is also among @entity0 's defensive targets
