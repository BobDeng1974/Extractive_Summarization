by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 19:19 est , 15 march 2013 campaigners against the £ 34billion @entity4 rail project yesterday won their fight for higher compensation			1

objections from protesters were not ‘ conscientiously considered ’ by ministers , according to a judge			2
blow : the government suffered a humiliating set - back to its £ 34billion high speed rail project today			0
a high speed train is pictured the government will now have to hold the £ 3.6million consultation again and bills picked up by the taxpayer could soar			0
the decision was hailed as a stunning victory for ‘ @entity26 ’ and for the @entity27 , which comprises more than 70 action and residents ’ associations			2
the court heard that around 172,000 homes within 0.6 miles of the first phase of the line from @entity35 to @entity36 are affected by ‘ @entity4 blight ’			1
however some campaigners put the figure as high as 350,000 with a compensation bill of around £ 2.5billion			0
the government won nine other cases yesterday relating to the plan to run 225mph trains from @entity35 to the @entity45 and beyond in a y - shaped route to @entity47 and @entity48			1
under the compensation scheme , those living in a ‘ safeguarded zone ’ within 60 metres of the line will receive a package involving the unblighted value of their property plus 10 per cent and moving costs			2
outside this zone there are a number of less generous discretionary compensation schemes including for those living between 60 metres and 120 metres from the line			2
the @entity4 plan has proved unpopular with many and questions have been raised about the benefits it will bring an ‘ exceptional hardship ’ scheme exists for those who can prove they are forced to move			1
the scheme has provoked a revolt in @entity75 heartlands because it runs through areas of outstanding natural beauty , including the @entity78 and parts of @entity80			0
allowing the challenge by @entity83 , mr @entity81 ruled : ‘ all in all , the consultation on compensation was so unfair as to be unlawful			0
’ @entity86 , appearing for @entity83 , argued successfully that tens of thousands of people who ‘ just happen to live and own properties ’ along the high - speed route faced loss of value on their homes and being unable to move or remortgage for 15 years or more			1
the nine legal claims rejected by the judge included attacks on the manner in which the project had been steered through @entity99 and alleged breaches of @entity103 environmental and habitat directives			0
ministers say the 351 - mile scheme – which wo n’t be completed until 2033 – is in the national interest , will regenerate the @entity107 , boost jobs and help @entity109 compete in the world			0
journey times will be cut			0
rail minister @entity112 said : ‘ this is a major landmark victory for @entity4 and the future of @entity109			1
‘ the judge has categorically given the green light for the government to press ahead without delay			0
’ campaigners against the high speed rail link claimed today 's judgement was a ' huge victory '			1
ministers had provoked fury when they described thousands of middle class homeowners alarmed that their properties were suddenly worthless as selfish ‘ nimbys ’ – the acronym for ‘ not in my @entity129 ’			2
it was claimed they were putting their own family interests ahead of the national interest			0
speaking following today 's judgement , @entity135 , who represented @entity27 , expressed delight at the victory			1
anger : the plans for the new high speed rail line has angered ' @entity26 '			1
these posters are found in the village of @entity144 in @entity145 mr @entity135 said : ' this was never a @entity148 argument			0
many thousands of people living along the route will not be able to sell their homes for some 15 years because their homes are blighted			1
‘ they should not have to bear the burden for this national project			0
' we hope now that proper arrangements are put in place by the government for compensation for those who live by the proposed @entity4 route to make it possible for them to move if and when they wish , in the same way that the rest of us can			1
’ councillor @entity169 , leader of the @entity170 of 18 local authorities which have joined forces to oppose the first stage of the route as far as @entity36 , said they were likely to lodge appeals on some of the points on which they had lost today			0
‘ people are angry , ’ he said			2
@entity83 spokesman @entity179 said it was estimated that more than 300,000 households faced blight from phases one and two of the high - speed project and would need compensation : ’ we do n't have a value for what the compensation bill will be ’			0
