@entity1 's @entity0 on guitar , golf and playing for @entity4 ... who is your sporting hero ? @entity8			1
i play in the same position , so i watched him a lot and liked the way he played and as i was growing up i ’ve looked to mould my game on him , what he does and how he plays in that position			1
@entity0 ( left ) has moulded his career on his hero former @entity18 winger @entity8 ( right ) what would you be if you were n’t a sportsman ? i honestly do n’t know but i have thought about property , being in that business			1
but i think it would still have to be something in sport or sport - related as i do n’t know what else i would like to be in			1
which other sportsman would you like to be ? i would be a golfer i think			0
they travel to the most amazing places and a lot of the time the sun is shining when you watch it , so you are thinking it would be great to play on these courses in this weather			2
a great career and a good chance to travel the world at the same time			2
due to his height , @entity0 said @entity42 ( pictured ) would be the idea person to play him in a film of his life career highlight ? playing for @entity4			1
do n’t think there would be anything higher in the game than that			1
i am very proud to have achieved it and would love to again			0
... and the worst moment ? getting relegated			0
it is a horrible thing and something i would n’t wish on my fellow professionals			0
it affects everyone at the club you are at when this happens			0
if your house was burning down , what one possession would you save ? other than my wife of course , it would have to be the dogs			0
we have three so i would make sure i got those out			0
favourite karaoke song ? i have a couple : @entity71 ’s @entity70 and @entity73 ’s @entity72			1
the second is a bit cringy , but you can really go for it as everyone sings it with you , so they ca n’t really hear your voice if it ’s bad ! three most - listened to songs on your ipod ? i have @entity86 ’s new album @entity84 , which i am really enjoying			1
i could n’t pick out three songs , i am enjoying it all the way through			2
i ’d recommend it , definitely			0
@entity91 is @entity0 ' go - to karaoke song along with @entity71 's @entity70 playing for @entity4 is the highlight of @entity0 ' career and he would love it to happen again the last book @entity0 read was former @entity18 manager sir @entity97 's autobiography last book you read ? it was sir @entity97 ’s autobiography			1
it was a very good read , very interesting			0

can you cook ? best dish ? i can cook — my signature dish would have to be spaghetti bolognese			0
i am better at following instructions than making my own meals or recipe			0
in a film of your life , who would you like to play you ? it ’s an easy one this because everyone batters me for my height , so i would say @entity42			1
but look at all the films he has done , so not a bad choice " ! tell us a secret ... i used to play the guitar when i was really young			2
i have n’t played in years so think i would have lost the art by now , but it is something people would n’t have known about me			0
