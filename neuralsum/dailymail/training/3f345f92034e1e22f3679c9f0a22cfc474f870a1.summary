the citizens @entity0 on @entity2 , a self - selected group of former top military officers , @entity5 insiders and think - tankers , declared tuesday in @entity7 that a seven - month review of the deadly 2012 terrorist attack has determined that it could have been prevented – if the @entity10 had n't been helping to arm @entity12 militias throughout @entity13 a year earlier			1
' the @entity10 switched sides in the war on terror with what we did in @entity13 , knowingly facilitating the provision of weapons to known @entity12 militias and figures , ' @entity14 , a member of the commission and a former @entity5 officer , told @entity26			1
she blamed the @entity28 administration for tacitly approving the diversion of half of a $ 1 billion @entity32 arms shipment to @entity12 - linked militants			1
' remember , these weapons that came into @entity2 were permitted to enter by our armed forces who were blockading the approaches from air and sea , ' @entity34 claimed			2
' they were permitted to come in			0
... [ they ] knew these weapons were coming in , and that was allowed			2
. ' the intelligence community was part of that , the @entity46 was part of that , and certainly that means that the top leadership of the @entity10 , our national security leadership , and potentially @entity56 – if they were briefed on this – also knew about this			1
' the weapons were intended for @entity61 but allowed by the @entity10 to flow to his @entity63 opposition			1

) @entity72 , former @entity5 officer @entity73 and civil rights attorney @entity71 on september 11 , 2012 armed terror - linked militias attacked @entity10 diplomatic outposts in @entity2 , @entity13 , killing four @entity10 and driving the @entity10 out of that part of the country ' the @entity80 and senior congressional members , ' the group wrote in an interim report released tuesday , ' deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler [ @entity61 ] who had been working closely with the @entity88 actively to suppress @entity12			1
' ' some look at it as treasonous moves , ' said @entity73 , a former @entity5 officer who participated in the commission 's research			2
' and our men and women had to follow what many purport as , qualify as treasonous moves			0
' retired rear admiral @entity70 , one of the commission 's sources , told reporters tuesday that those weapons are now ' all in @entity103			0
' ' @entity61 was n't a good guy , but he was being marginalized , ' @entity70 recalled			2
' @entity61 actually offered to abdicate ' shortly after the beginning of a 2011 rebellion			1
' but the @entity10 ignored his calls for a truce , ' the commission wrote , ultimately backing the horse that would later help kill a @entity10 ambassador			1
@entity70 said that the effort at truce talks fell apart when the @entity80 declined to let the @entity114 pursue it seriously			0
' we had a leader who had won the @entity117 , ' @entity70 said , ' but who was unwilling to give peace a chance for 72 hours			0
' in march 2011 , @entity70 said , @entity122 commander general @entity121 told @entity123 that the @entity10 military was not actively targeting @entity61			1
that , @entity70 revealed , was a signal to the @entity13 dictator that there was a chance for a deal			0
@entity61 responded by ' verifiably ... pull [ ing ] his forces back from key rebel - held cities such as @entity2 and @entity135			1
' @entity136 served as the @entity10 ambassador to @entity13 from june 2012 to september 11 , 2012 when he was killed in the attack then - secretary of state @entity139 told the @entity140 in january 23 that it mattered little why the @entity2 diplomatic compound was attacked : ' what difference , at this point , does it make ? ' @entity61 wanted only two conditions to step down : permission to keeo fighting @entity146 ( @entity146 ) , and the lifting of sactions against him , his family , and those loyal to him			1
the @entity28 administration 's unwillingness to help broker a peaceful exit for the @entity13 strongman , ' led to extensive loss of life ( including four @entity10 ) ' when @entity12 - linked militants attacked @entity10 diplomatic facilities in the city of @entity2 , ' the commission told reporters			1
the @entity80 and the @entity162 did not immediately respond to questions about the group 's findings			0
' we do n't claim to have all the answers here , ' said @entity169 , whose center - right group @entity170 sponsored the group and its work			1
' we hope you will , please , pursue this , ' he told reporters			0
' retired admiral @entity70 said the @entity80 refused to let the @entity114 pursue a peaceful exit for @entity61 : ' we had a leader who had won the @entity117 , but who was unwilling to give peace a chance for 72 hours ' the commission and @entity170 filed 85 document requests under the @entity184 , hitting the @entity114 , @entity46 , @entity185 and @entity5 with demand after demand			1
but most of its information has come from insiders with deep knowledge of the flow of weapons in @entity13 and elsewhere in the @entity195			0
admiral @entity72 told the group that he believes the raid on the @entity2 compound was intended as a kidnapping exercise , aimed at snatching @entity10 ambassador @entity136 and demanding a prisoner swap for the ' blind sheikh ' @entity202			1
@entity202 is serving a life sentence in federal prison for planning the 1993 bombing of the @entity207 garage in @entity208			1
he also masterminded a plan , later foiled , to blow up the @entity210 , both the @entity212 and @entity213 tunnels , the @entity214 and a federal building where the @entity185 had a base of operations			0
a senior @entity185 source , @entity72 said tuesday , ' told me that was the plan			0
' the attack , history shows , grew in intensity and resulted in the deaths of @entity136 and three other @entity10 personnel			1
@entity72 also said @entity10 claims that it lacked the resources to mount a counterattack in time to save lives is false			1
' i 'm going to tell you that 's not true , ' he said			0
' we had a 130 - man unit of forces at @entity235 [ @entity236 in @entity237 ]			0
they were ready to go			0
' ' the flight time from @entity235 to @entity2 is roughly an hour			2
' killed : an image captured by a cellular phone camera shows the arrest of strongman @entity61 in @entity243 , @entity13 on october 20 , 2011 former @entity5 officer @entity14 accused the @entity10 government of allowing arms to flow to @entity12 militants who opposed @entity61 in 2011 , ' switching sides in the war on terror ' some of the group 's claims strain credibility , including the assertion that the @entity28 administration 's early effort to blame the @entity2 attack on a protest against a crude anti-muslim @entity259 video ' appears to have been well - coordinated with @entity262 organizations as well as islamic state members of the @entity264 ( @entity264 )			1
' those groups , the commission noted , ' all joined in condemnation of the video , and , even more troubling , issued calls for restrictions on @entity10 ’ free speech rights			1
' but @entity73 , the former @entity5 officer , criticized the @entity28 administration on the familiar refrain of then - secretary of state @entity139 exclaiming in a @entity140 hearing that it mattered little why the @entity2 facilities were struck			2
' they believed they were going to be saved , that they were going to be rescued , but they were n't , ' @entity73 said of the four @entity10 who died			2
' i know who made the decision , in my heart of hearts , to leave our war fighters there and be blown up			0
and then to have one of the most powerful politicians in our country sit there and say , " what difference does it make ? " – should be an alarm bell for all @entity10			2
' it haunts me , ' @entity73 said			0
' i play that line over , and over , and over , and over in my mind			0
' the group has called for a @entity301 to investigate the @entity2 episode			2
a total of 189 @entity80 members have signed on to a bill that would create the committee , which would be bipartisan and have sweeping powers to subpoena the executive branch			0
house speaker @entity309 , @entity34 said tuesday , ' he blocked it			0
one has to wonder if he and @entity56 have had some sort of briefing on what happened			0
' @entity70 insisted that @entity56 is unable to break logjams in the @entity28 administration and find out what happened in the days leading up to and following the @entity2 attack without a new committee			1
' if they do n't have strong subpoena power , if they do n't have the ability to do long - term cross examination , it wo n't work , ' he said .			2

@entity65 on @entity2 claims the @entity10 government allowed arms to flow to @entity12 - linked militants who opposed @entity61
their rise to power , the group says , led to the @entity2 attack in 2012
the group claims the strongman @entity61 offered to abdicate his presidency , but the @entity10 refused to broker his peaceful exit
the commission , part of the center - right @entity341 , concluded that the @entity2 attack was a failed kidnapping plot
@entity10 ambassador @entity136 was to be captured and traded for ' blind sheikh ' @entity202 , who *hatched* the 1993 @entity207 bombing plot
