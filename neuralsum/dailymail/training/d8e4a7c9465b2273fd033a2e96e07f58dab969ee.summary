@entity0 has lifted a ban on safari hunting after it caused financial problems for the country			1
the 20 - month ban was imposed in january 2013 over allegations of corruption in the awarding of government hunting concessions , and amid fears for the future of the country 's population of big cats			1
' we lost too much revenue following the ban on hunting and the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) had a lot of financial problems , ' said tourism minister @entity22			1
big cats : sadly , for some tourists , the appeal of hunting these animals is greater than viewing them @entity20 spokesperson @entity27 said in a statement that the ban on the hunting of lions and leopards remained in place			2
' @entity33 will be conducted under laid down conditions and strict supervision from @entity20			0
but the ban on big cats still stands , ' @entity27 said			0
the southern @entity38 country , home to magnificent wildlife and the world - famous @entity41 , hopes to develop a wildlife tourism trade , which has long been a mainstay of the economies in neighbouring countries			1
at the time the ban was imposed , the former tourism minister @entity47 said : ' we do not have enough cats for hunting purposes			1
' @entity20 had opposed the ban , saying it would be bad for the tourism industry			0
' the population of cats in @entity0 is around 3,400 to 3,500 , and with the ban on safari hunting for cats we are likely to lose on revenue , ' said @entity20 's head of research , @entity63			1
' it is these cats that make @entity0 's safari hunting competitive in the region , ' he said			1
home to the world famous @entity41 , @entity0 hopes to develop its wildlife tourism trade only 55 felines were hunted a year , he said , though the income from the sport was unknown			1
shortly before the ban was imposed , @entity20 's director and senior officials were fired for alleged corruption in the awarding of safari hunting concessions			1
the country 's hunting community saw the ban as political meddling			2
' blood sport is more beneficial to this country than game viewing , ' said @entity89 of the @entity90			2
' people from @entity92 and @entity93 wish to hunt here but they will now move elsewhere , meaning all the clients will leave @entity0 , ' he added			2
conservationists , however , had welcomed the ban			0
@entity97 , a photographer and travel guide with @entity100 , who specialise in tours to the area , said removing the ban was ' deplorable '			0
' if an old animal is dying of starvation and on its last legs and someone pays thousands of dollars to shoot it , then with those funds the community is able to build schools , repair park fences and employ wardens , it has to be looked at , ' he said			0
' however , this is seldom , if ever , the case			0
permits are handed out willy - nilly to whichever ethically derelict hunter can afford the fat fee , so desperate they are to put the trophy on their wall			0
someone in government gets a fat pay off from these canned hunts and the rest turn a blind eye			0
' ' cats bring in money from tourism , unfortunately the pernicious desires of a few corrupt greed - heads just steepens the predators descent into oblivion			0
