it ’s a huge target but we ’re confident we can hit it			2
‘ our message to our donors is quite simple - do n’t risk letting @entity28 back in			0
‘ we tell them to think of their donation as an insurance policy against @entity5 becoming prime minister			2
’ the source said @entity28 would ‘ never raise this amount from the unions – or anyone else ’			0
election spending for each party is capped at about £ 20 million in the year running up to the general election			2
in the last campaign the @entity3 spent £ 16.7 million – around £ 3 million short of the limit			1
insiders say entrepreneurs alarmed by @entity5 's anti-business rhetoric are reaching for their chequebooks the new target shows the @entity48 are determined to max out their spending this time			1
