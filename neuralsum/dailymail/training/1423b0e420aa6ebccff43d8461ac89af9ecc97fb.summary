by @entity0 last updated at 1:25 am on 25th november 2011 he is only 14 and too small to even see over the ledge of the dock when he appeared in court			2
but a teenager admitted having two handguns and live bullets stashed under the floorboards at his home			1
he had also been convicted of carrying a knife in the street when aged just 13			2
lethal weapon : a @entity15 self loading pistol , similar to the one found at the home of the 14 - year - old schoolboy ( file photo ) however , despite these offences , he walked free when a judge said the law had ‘ tied his hands ’			1
judge @entity25 said his powers were ‘ severely limited ’ and he could not lock up the boy because he was not considered a ‘ dangerous offender ’			1
he told the defendant : ‘ if you were two years older , you would be facing a minimum sentence of three years ’ detention			1
‘ @entity33 has tied my hands almost completely			1
i have no power at all in the particular circumstances of your case to send you to any form of detention			0
there is really only one sentence i can pass which is a youth rehabilitation order			1
’ the judge added that he could not even put the boy under a more intensive supervision and surveillance programme because he was not a ‘ persistent offender ’			2
the sentence at @entity48 prompted anger from campaign group @entity50			2
founder @entity51 , 56 , who lost her son @entity52 , 22 , in 2002 when he was shot outside a nightclub , said she was shocked			0
‘ it is difficult to believe that something like this that puts more lives in danger could be dealt with so leniently , ’ she said			0
discovered : an @entity61 @entity60 pistol , similar to the one found by police ‘ we want strong deterrent sentences			1
what message does this send ? if you are 14 you can get caught with a gun and walk free ? ‘ the statistics show that more and more young people are being found with guns and this will not help to stem the problem			2
’ detectives suspected the @entity61 and @entity76 pistols , along with 13 rounds of ammunition , were being looked after for older criminals involved in drugs and violence			1
the court heard the haul was found in a raid at the boy ’s home in @entity87 , @entity88 , in august			1
prosecutor @entity89 said the teenager claimed he was befriended by another boy in a local park who asked him to look after a package			0
the defendant , who can not be named for legal reasons , thought it was cash but , after opening it , failed to call police			0
the boy admitted two counts of possessing a prohibited firearm and one of possessing ammunition without a licence			0
seat of justice ? judge @entity25 told @entity109 he was powerless to give the teen a custodial sentence sentencing him to the three - year order , judge @entity25 said : ‘ you have a chance , please use it			1
‘ do i need to emphasise how dangerous guns are ? they kill people			0
while a gun remains in criminal circulation , the risk is high that it is going to be used to commit crime , to kill or to cause serious injury			0
‘ those who store guns keep them in the hands of the wrong people			2
that is what you did and the courts generally take a very serious view of this sort of thing			0
’ he added ‘ no court can be other than deeply disturbed ’ that a 14 - year - old with a conviction for possessing an offensive weapon at just 13 was found in possession of two handguns and ammunition			1
the boy ’s solicitor @entity140 said he was not involved with gangs and hoped to be an engineer but had been excluded from school			0
anyone aged 18 or over caught with a gun must serve at least five years in prison			0
those aged 16 or 17 must serve at least three years .			0
