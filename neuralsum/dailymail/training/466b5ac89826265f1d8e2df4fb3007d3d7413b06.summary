by @entity0 published : 04:52 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 13 april 2013 professor sir @entity1 told the @entity2 that care at the centre at the @entity6 children 's heart unit was ' on the edge of acceptability ' a senior @entity10 executive has declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis - hit child heart unit in @entity6			1
professor sir @entity1 spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates			1
sir @entity1 , who now oversees @entity10 death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011 , said that care at @entity6 was ‘ on the edge of acceptability ’			1
the father of a ten - year - old daughter , @entity25 , and three grown - up sons , he said : ‘ i tell you that i have a young daughter , i would go somewhere else			0
i would go to @entity29			0
’ his comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at @entity34			0
they want him to be sacked , accusing him of ‘ conducting a cynical vendetta ’			0
paediatric heart surgery at @entity6 was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by sir @entity1 appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average			1
surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive			0
but others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the @entity48 quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline children ’s heart services			0
the hospital insisted the data was incomplete and that full figures would confirm the unit to be @entity59 resumed earlier this week and @entity60 said it was satisfied that immediate safety concerns had been dealt with			2
however , sir @entity1 ’s comments on @entity65 ’s @entity64 programme will reignite the controversy			1
he insisted that , despite safety assurances , a comprehensive analysis of the data showed the unit should remain under supervision			1
‘ we find they ’re just on the edge of what we call an alert			0
‘ in other words , showing that they were right on the edge of acceptability , ’ he said			2
children 's heart surgery at the hospital was suspended at the end of last month after data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres			1
it re-opened again on wednesday @entity88 said that the quality of its service had been independently verified during a rapid review			2
a spokesman added : ‘ this was publicly reconfirmed at a meeting of councillors in @entity6 on wednesday when the deputy medical director of @entity60 reaffirmed that all child heart surgery units in @entity60 , including @entity6 , are safe to undertake surgery			1
’ the @entity100 campaign group said sir @entity1 ’s involvement in deciding which child heart units should close means he is far from impartial			1
his comments , added spokesman @entity103 , were ‘ extremely unhelpful and undermine the progress made over the last few days to begin to rebuild heart patients ’ families ’ trust and confidence ’			2
@entity110 , @entity110 mp for @entity111 , called for sir @entity1 to be @entity112 said the remarks had caused huge and unnecessary distress to families as well as slurring the reputation of those working at the unit			1
@entity10 medical director , sir @entity117 , took the decision to suspend treatment at the unit but said he now ‘ disagreed ’ with sir @entity1			1
‘ having reviewed the unit , having reviewed the data , the performance in @entity6 is in keeping with good national standards and i would be very happy to have my child operated upon in @entity6 , ’ said sir @entity117			2
@entity34 is at the centre of a long - running row over the future of children 's heart services at the hospital			2
the @entity10 announced last july it wanted to close three units and keep seven open , the idea being to concentrate specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients			0
those currently chosen to stay open are at @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity29 , @entity143 and two @entity145 closure are units at @entity148 ’s @entity147 , @entity145 ’s @entity149 and the @entity6 site			0
this means patients in @entity153 would be being forced to travel to @entity142 or @entity29 for treatment - a 150 or 200 - mile round trip respectively			0
there is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the @entity153 and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit , organised by the group @entity100 ( @entity100 )			2
last month , a high court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘ secretive ’ approach of @entity10 chiefs			0
mrs @entity168 backed claims by @entity170 that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept @entity177 month , she ruled the decision was ' unfair and legally flawed '			0
but within 24 hours , sir @entity117 , medical director of @entity60 , had travelled to @entity6 to suspend congenital heart surgery after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average			1
he said the figures were among a ' constellation of reasons ' behind the suspension .			0

professor sir @entity1 is the *government* 's former head of heart disease
surgery at the unit was suspended after data showed high death rates
unit was closed for 11 days but re-opened on wednesday
but sir @entity1 said care at @entity6 was still ' on the edge of acceptability '
