@entity0 are flying the flag for @entity2 in the @entity3 and take on @entity4 in the first leg of their round of 16 clash at @entity9 on thursday night			1
@entity10 fans and perhaps even @entity12 may have been happy to avoid giants such as @entity14 and @entity15 , but face a @entity17 side who are unbeaten in their domestic league			1
the @entity21 strugglers may be the last @entity22 team left in @entity23 after next week 's @entity25 fixtures			0
so , do we know enough about their opponents ? @entity0 manager @entity12 faces a tough challenge when @entity4 visit @entity9 star players @entity31 @entity33 's captain had a three - game ban reduced after an appeal so he can play in thursday night 's game , and his presence could be crucial for the visitors			1
a creative winger , @entity31 loves cutting in from the right - hand side onto his favoured left foot and has impressed for @entity42 against @entity2 over the years			0
@entity12 said : ' it is a blow from our point of view because @entity31 is one of their best performers			0
' @entity31 ( left ) has had his ban reduced and will be aiming to fire the @entity51 side to victory @entity53 linked with @entity55 and @entity56 , the defender is seen as a rising prospect of the game but is already a key player for @entity33			1
their manager @entity60 confirmed as much			2
' you are asking about one of the best players in my team and i do n't want to lose this player			0
' he is a top - class player and i hope he will stay with us			0
' @entity53 ( right ) is seen as a rising prospect in world football as a defender @entity72 a mainstay in a talented @entity76 team , it was somewhat of a surprise when this central midfielder opted for a move to @entity42 when leaving @entity80 last year			2
@entity72 has played at @entity9 before , and will be hoping to prove his 52 international class convert to class on the field , too			2
@entity72 has been capped 52 times by @entity76 and is a classy player in midfield the manager @entity60 should know all about @entity0 having played in the @entity21 for five years with @entity88 and most notably @entity56			1
the striker cost @entity56 around Â£ 11million in 2000 but only scored 10 goals in 60 games ... he will be hoping for better luck on @entity94 soil on this occasion			0

he said in his pre-match conference : ' any success for @entity4 is success for the whole of @entity42			2

' former @entity56 flop @entity60 has impressed in his first stint as manager with @entity33 form thirteen wins from 16 games helping them establish a seven - point advantage over @entity113 in the league is one thing , but @entity33 have brought that style to the @entity3 , too			1
the @entity51 giants stormed through their group and beat @entity119 4 - 3 on aggregate in their round of 32 fixture , despite going down to nine men in the first leg .			1
