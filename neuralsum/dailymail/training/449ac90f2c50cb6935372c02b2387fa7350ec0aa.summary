by @entity0 saved ? scientists claim tomatoes grown amongst other vegetables could protected from whiteflies it is a problem that has puzzled generations of gardeners - but keeping annoying pests away from prized tomatoes may in fact be very simple			1
academics have found that the whitefly , a devastating bug that weaken and kill plants , are easily distracted by the smell of other vegetables			2
simply mixing tomatoes in amongst other plants such as cucumbers or courgettes may be enough to keep the pests at bay			1
scientists at the @entity24 exposed whitefly to a heady aroma of watercress , watermelon , cabbage , cucumber , courgette and beans			1
as a result , the insects struggled to attack tomato plants growing in a greenhouse			1
dr @entity37 , who co-wrote the study , said : ' it 's like trying to concentrate on work while the tv 's on and the radio 's blaring out and someone 's talking to you			0
' you ca n't do it - or at least not properly or efficiently - and it 's the same for the whitefly			0
' whiteflies use their sense of smell to locate tomato plants			2
by bombarding its senses with a range of different smells we create " sensory confusion " and the result is that the insect becomes disorientated and is unable to feed			0
' @entity60 is a major worldwide threat to greenhouse crops and is traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides or natural parasites			0
but the research has opened up the possibilities of an effective , organic way of battling the pest , both on an industrial scale and in amateurs ' back gardens or allotments			1
like many pests , a whitefly feeds by pushing its long mouthpiece into a leaf until it reaches the nutrient - rich plant sap			2
in doing so it weakens the plant and leaves behind a sticky excretion that encourages the development of mould			0
pests struggled to get to the tomatoes hidden between courgettes , beans and cabbages but locating the right plant cells is technically challenging for the insect and can go wrong if it is distracted			1
the study , published in the journal @entity94 , shows that the ' confusion effect ' of an array of vegetable smells can be used to protect a single crop			0
it distracts the bug long enough for the plant 's own defence mechanism to kick in , producing a chemical that makes it and neighbouring plants unpalatable to insects			1
dr @entity37 said : ' because the effect is temporary - we saw it last no more than 15 hours - it 's unlikely this method alone could be used to control crop pests			2
but this is an easy and safe way of buying the plants time until their own chemical defence mechanisms kick in			2
' used in conjunction with other methods , sensory confusion opens up a whole new area in sustainable pest control			0
' the findings suggest there could be an organic way to fight pests on an industrial scale and at home co-author dr @entity128 , also from the @entity24 , said : ' plants talk to each other when they are under attack , producing chemicals which warn other plants close by of the threat			1
at the same time , they produce a chemical which is unpleasant to the predator			0
' but this response does n't happen immediately , so if we can confuse the insects long enough to give the plants time to defend themselves this may go some way to reducing crop losses			1
' the authors think that the same technique could be used to battle other pests , such as blackfly and aphids , and the principle should apply to vegetables other than tomatoes			1
dr @entity128 said that the team is talking to industrial growers about developing an organic spray which pumps the scent of other vegetables into a glasshouse			0
but for amateur growers , simply planting vegetables among other varieties should do just as well - whether in a greenhouse or in the garden			0
' mixing things up should really do the trick , ' he said .			0
