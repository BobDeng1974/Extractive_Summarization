the @entity42 is contesting the case because it officially denies liability and maintains the @entity6 have left it too late to make claims			1
yesterday , each of the three claimants walked slowly to the witness stand to deliver their graphic testimony			2
but before @entity52 , the @entity42 ’s @entity53 , cross-examined them , he said : ‘ i wish to make it clear that the @entity5 government does not dispute that each of you suffered torture and other ill - treatment at the hands of the colonial administration			1
