' ' but it 's not like there was anything special going on			0
she just stood in line like everyone else			0
i hope she stopped at @entity15 locations all the way from @entity12 to wherever she 's headed			0
' the ' @entity2 ' van , named as an homage to the @entity2 cartoon and its ' @entity2 ' vehicle , is an upgraded @entity7 1500			1
