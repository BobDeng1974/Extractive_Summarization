he was sentenced to 14 months in prison today at @entity83 after admitting placing a hoax bomb			1
judge @entity85 told him : ' you placed that device with the intention of inducing someone else to think the object would explore or ignite and likely cause damage			0
' the constable had the unnerving experience to look through the letterbox to find this extraordinary object on the top of the stairs with a red light and wires coming out of it			2
' a 100 metre cordon was thrown round your house , which meant that everyone living within it had to evacuate their homes regardless of their state of health and told to leave their pets behind			0
' they were kept out of their homes for eight or nine hours			0
' it caused immense disruption to the lives of a very large number of people and the whole dreadful incident was spun out for the whole of the day			0
' the fact is that those members of the emergency services who attended were then not available had there been a genuine emergency elsewhere			0
' the enormity of what you did was a deliberate and calculated act			0
you said you felt intimidated by your neighbours - even though on investigation they felt contrary			2
' it is just wholly unacceptable that you respond by drinking alcohol and erecting this hoax device			1
' i regard this as a grave crime , in reality , committed against the whole community			0
' all those people who had their lives turned upside down for the whole of that day - i stress it was avoidable			0
' chaos : dozens of armed police were involved in a nine - hour siege after @entity10 alerted police with a sinister text message			1

' they were able to trace it back to @entity35			0
mr @entity154 said : ' officers banged on the door but there was no answer , so they looked through the letter box			0
' the officers could see a 2ft tall , deep purple cylinder emblazoned with an orange hazard sticker on the top of the stairs			2
wires connected it to a device which had a red light and it looked like explosives			0
14 month sentence : @entity10 was given a jail term at @entity83 , with the judge telling him he had committed a ' grave crime ' against the ' whole community ' ' post-it notes were stuck to the stairs , one of which read : ' just one more step			1
' the notes were inviting someone to go upstairs - officers felt is was a trap being prepared			2
' the defendant was aware that the bomb unit and armed police were in attendance but he would not surrender and he seemed to have a weapon under his bed			2
at 5pm the police decided entry should be forced			0
' once inside , police found parts of the dismantled bomb around the house and arrested @entity10 in his bedroom			1
in mitigation , his counsel @entity212 told the hearing : ' it was his intention to frighten the neighbours , not to alarm the wider public			0
he 's desperately sorry for what he 's done			0
he bitterly regrets his actions on that day			0
' @entity219 : @entity221 ( pictured ) and adjacent @entity220 were sealed off by police during the scare and residents evacuated after the case , det insp @entity225 from @entity226 said : ' i hope the jail sentence serves as a warning to others who think it is acceptable to concoct such terrifying hoaxes			2
' all three emergency services had to respond to this incident which resulted in hours of wasted time and of course wasted money from the public purse			0
' it was also a frightening experience for local residents who had to evacuate their homes and be moved to a rest centre whilst we dealt with the incident			0
' @entity10 will not be able to reflect on what he has done whilst serving time in prison and hopefully he will realise the impact his actions have had on people			2
