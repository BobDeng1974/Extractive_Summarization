we 're all living longer than ever - but will a poor lifestyle send some of us to an early grave ? worldwide , a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 , according to a recent @entity6 report on life expectancy			2
in the @entity10 , life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83 , meanwhile in the @entity12 it is 76 and 81 respectively			0
but are your habits and lifestyle knocking years off your life ? in a bid to raise awareness about the risk factors for a premature death , @entity18 medical experts from various organisations - including the @entity20 - compiled this life expectancy calculator			1
called @entity27 , it was created by a team investigating the deaths of 70,000 people - and how different health behaviours affected the risk of death			1
it takes into account a person 's height and weight , if they smoke ( or ever have ) and how often alcohol is consumed			1
fruit and vegetable intake is also taken into account - in particular the quantity of fruit juice , salad , fruit , salad , potatoes and carrots consumed each week			1
later questions relate to exercise ; how many hours are spent a ) jogging or running and b ) playing ice hockey , soccer , basketball , volleyball , or rollerblading			0
activities such a walking , cycling , gardening , golfing , bowling and fishing are calculated as leisure time			1
finally , stress levels , health conditions ( such as heart disease and diabetes ) and household income are factored in			1
take the test here while the health dangers of smoking are well known , research is increasingly showing that being obese and / or sedentary may be just as bad			0
last month , @entity77 researchers warned that lack of exercise is a worse risk for women over 30 than obesity or smoking			0
and a study published in the @entity85 reported that stress can lower life expectancy			2
researchers from the @entity89 found the risk of heart attack or stroke increases by 20 per cent when a person suffers from low - level stress			2
mental illness has even more of a toll and is as bad as smoking , according to @entity99 research published last month			0
serious mental illness can reduce a person 's life expectancy by 10 to 20 years , when the average reduction in life expectancy for heavy smokers is eight to 10 years			0
across the globe , life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in @entity109 - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in @entity111 - 87			0

called @entity27 , it was created by @entity18 medical experts investigating the deaths of 70,000 people
takes into account factors such as fruit and veg consumption , stress levels and existing medical conditions
plus the amount of sport and leisure activities *undertaken* each week , household income and height / weight
