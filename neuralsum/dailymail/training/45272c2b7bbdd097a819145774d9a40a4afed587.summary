the prime minister admitted in an interview that he is a member of # @entity10 - which is used by those rooting for the @entity3 in her very public battle with ex-husband @entity5			1
mr @entity6 yesterday brushed aside her admission that she had snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis , hailing her as a ‘ very funny and warm person ’ who creates good recipes			1
but his comments led to him becoming embroiled in the ongoing trial at @entity23 , with the judge saying the prime minister caused this morning 's proceedings to be ' wasted '			1
backing : @entity6 has revealed he is supporting tv cook @entity3 in her public battles with her husband , but a judge in her staff 's fraud trial has criticised him for his comments thanks : miss @entity3 has used the hashtag # @entity33 to thank her supporters , and offer a recipe for @entity36 justice @entity37 told jurors in the trial of @entity40 and @entity41 it was ' of regret ' when public figures commented about someone involved in a trial and urged them to only decide the case based on the evidence in court			1
public criticism : judge @entity37 today said that it was ' of regret ' that @entity6 had commented on the row between @entity3 and @entity5 @entity54 , referred to as @entity55 , 41 , and sister @entity41 , 35 , of @entity56 , west @entity57 , each deny a single count of committing fraud by using a company credit card for personal gain between january 1 , 2008 , and december 31 last year			1

the judge says their legal team claims the siblings are ' aggrieved ' by @entity6 's comments			1
the problems have been sparked after the primer minister was asked by the @entity75 if he was a member of # @entity10 , and mr @entity6 admitted : ‘ i am			1
’ he went on : ‘ i ’m a massive fan , i ’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person			1
‘ but i ’m also an amateur cook and i like her recipes			2
@entity85 [ @entity6 ’s nine - year - old daughter ] and i sometimes watch a bit of @entity3 on telly			2
not in court , i hasten to add			0
’ judge @entity37 told jurors at @entity23 the comments were ' regrettable ' and directed the jury of seven men and five women to ignore the comments and to only focus on the evidence they have heard in open court			1
he said : ' ladies and gentlemen , the reason for delay is i have been taken to a large number of press reports			0
' they centre on the prime minister commenting about a prosecution witness , ms @entity3 , during an interview with a journalist			1
' it is of regret when people in public office comment about a person who is involved in a trial that is in progress			2
' it is inconceivable that some of your number may not have seen some of those comments			0
@entity33 : miss @entity3 's team of lawyers , prs and family who supported her as she gave evidence at @entity23 ' the defendants feel aggrieved as a result of the comments , though they do not specifically deal with matters in this trial , are favourable to ms @entity3			1
' the fact that they may feel aggrieved , the defendants , is not without justification			0
' you 'll realise that what public figures may feel about this case or a witness in this case , can have no bearing on the issues that you have to decide			0
' please use the written direction i gave you			0
' businessman @entity5 who has been locked in a bitter and very public dispute with his ex-wife @entity148 he directed jurors concentrate ' on the evidence , and submissions and the legal directions			0
' all this material , you 'll hear in this room and nowhere else			2
' he added : ' jurors are trusted to follow the judge 's directions and i trust you 'll do that			2
' apologising for wasting the court 's morning on legal argument , he added : ' i 'm sorry that it has had the effect of wasting almost all of the morning that should have been devoted to evidence and real issues in this case			0
' it is not clear if mr @entity6 has taken miss @entity3 up on her offer on @entity173 of the recipe for @entity36 , which she described as ' the perfect receip to show tanks for all your support and to those who hashtag # @entity10 '			1
happier times : @entity3 and @entity5 before they split back in june after an incident at @entity184 's restaurant in central @entity57 on trial : @entity187 sisters @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 who are accused of a £ 685,000 credit card fraud using @entity5 's company credit cards last week , ms @entity3 admitted taking cocaine with ex-husband @entity193 when he found out he had terminal cancer , and on another occasion in july 2010 during her troubled marriage to mr @entity5			1
the 53 - year - old also admitted smoking cannabis in the last year of her marriage to the art gallery owner but said the idea that she is a ' drug addict or habitual user of cocaine is absolutely ridiculous '			0
giving evidence on the witness stand , miss @entity3 admitted to taking drugs in front of her children			0
ms @entity3 spoke of suffering ' intimate terrorism ' at the hands of her multi-millionaire ex-husband , describing him as a ' brilliant , but brutal man '			0
she accused him of ' peddling ' stories about her alleged drug habit , including that he was checking her nose for cocaine when he was photographed gripping her throat outside @entity184 's restaurant in @entity220 , central @entity57 , in june			2
@entity5 earlier told the court he still ‘ absolutely adores ’ ex-wife @entity3 , was ‘ very upset ’ over claims she took cocaine and denies ‘ gripping , strangling or throttling ’ her outside a restaurant			0
instead , in the infamous incident captured on camera – which led to the couple ’s divorce – he claimed he was simply ‘ holding her head , by the neck , to get her to focus ’			0
miss @entity3 , he revealed , was unhappy in their marriage because she felt she needed to ask him for a ‘ pass ’ to do what she wanted			0
