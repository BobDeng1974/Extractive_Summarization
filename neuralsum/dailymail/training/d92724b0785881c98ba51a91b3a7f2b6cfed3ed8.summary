@entity1 's prime minister @entity0 resigned along with his entire cabinet today over the country 's deepening political crisis , as parliament repealed harsh anti-protester laws			1
@entity0 said he was stepping down in a bid to ease ' a political compromise to peacefully resolve the conflict ' and preserve @entity1 's unity , adding that he had been forced to work in ' extreme conditions '			1
in a statement on the presidential website prime minister @entity12 said : ' i accept the resignation of @entity0 and as a consequence the resignation of the entire @entity1 government			1
' he added that @entity0 will remain in a temporary role until a new government can be elected			1
@entity12 has also suggested he will offer an amnesty for arrested protesters on the condition that demonstrators stopped occupying buildings and ended their round - the - clock protests on @entity24 's central @entity49			2
@entity0 was a fierce political leader loyal to the president , who once told his critics to ' piss off '			1
the @entity53 national has been the target of opposition ridicule in the past for his inability to speak @entity1			1
he has blasted an @entity59 partnership deal that was scrapped by @entity12 and has hailed @entity53 's controversial bailout of @entity1 as ' historic '			1
@entity0 has also taken to @entity61 to thank supporters and take on critics , accusing the opposition of trying to stage a ' coup ' and reiterating his message of stability - particularly for pensioners			1
he headed the election campaign in 2010 that helped @entity12 defeat his sworn rival - now jailed opposition leader - @entity71			2
@entity0 's departure will be welcomed by the activists , as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred yesterday a man was found dead hanging from @entity49 protest ' tree ' in @entity24			1
the ' new year tree ' has become a symbol of pro-eu and anti-government protests standing guard : demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the @entity88 , which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests , but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency violent : hundreds of protestors burst into the building on sunday night			1
they erected a number of barricades , before burning a portrait of president @entity12 defence : the ministry is situated several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central @entity24			2
above , a protester erects a barricade near the building action : speaking to a local tv crew , ms @entity106 said the ' so - called protesters ' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters			2
above , demonstrators pull a public bin to be used in the construction of barricades @entity118 , one of the protest leaders , has already turned down the now - vacant prime minister 's job , which @entity12 had offered him on saturday			1
a key issue moving forwards will be the amnesty offer , which could allow for the release of dozens of protesters currently being held in jail in exchange for an end to the demonstrations			0
@entity0 's departure has brought encouragement to people at the protest encampment , but no inclination to end their demonstrations			1
' the authorities are afraid and making concessions			0
we should use this moment and continue our fight to achieve a change of power in @entity1 , ' said 23 - year - old demonstrator @entity144			2
in another sinister development yesterday a 55 - year - old man was found dead hanging from the framework of a huge artificial ' @entity150 tree ' in central @entity24 which has become a symbol of anti-government resistance			0
police said they removed the body , which was hanging inside the cone - shaped tubular steel construction on @entity24 's @entity49			0
the ' tree ' is festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader @entity71 and scrawled with graffiti attacking president @entity12			0
the body , that of a man from @entity163 in western @entity1 , had no external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death , a police statement said			2
the incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with protesters day and night since the onset of mass demonstrations against in early december			0
last night protesters briefly occupied the ministry building of @entity106 , @entity1 's justice minister , but abandoned it again after she threatened to call off talks and declare a state of emergency			1
seized : staff had also been attempting to make changes in the constitution , she said			0
above , three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons speech : opposition leader and former @entity188 heavyweight boxing champion @entity186 ( pictured ) addresses the media in front of the ministry in @entity24 today demonstrations : beleaguered president @entity12 offered the prime minister 's post to @entity118 on saturday , which he declined chaos : president @entity12 also offered former boxer @entity186 , another opposition leader , the role of deputy prime minister			1
above , protestors face riot police upcoming ' judgement day ' : mr @entity118 said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for tuesday would be ' judgement day ' though the occupation was short lived , it underlines protesters ' growing inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful demonstrations turned violent			0
three protesters died in the clashes last week , two of whom were shot by hunting rifles , which police insist they do not use			0
with protesters now willing to risk injury , a state of emergency would be likely to set off substantial fighting on the streets of the capital			0
' today , such a measure is not on the table , ' foreign minister @entity225 told journalists			2
@entity59 foreign police chief @entity229 said in a statement that she was alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency and warned that such a move ' would trigger a further downward spiral for @entity1 which would benefit no one			1
' @entity237 , who is set to travel to @entity1 tuesday , called for a dialogue and urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who resort to violence			2
protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown @entity24 , including @entity243			0
one of the buildings was seized in a spectacular assault early sunday , when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering			0
the crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left			0
@entity106 , in a televised statement , noted that protesters seized the building as justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to the activists and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power to the prime minister			1
a city in flames : the president 's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in @entity24 , with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall danger : demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the @entity276 building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas deal : president @entity12 has offered the role of prime minister to @entity118 ( left ) with fellow opposition leader @entity186 ( right ) as his deputy			1
concern : today 's prospect of a state of emergency also follows other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters in the wake of the violent clashes			2
three protesters have now died in the protests - two of them after being shot and one of unspecified injuries @entity12 on saturday offered the prime minister 's post to @entity118 , one of the opposition 's most prominent leaders			1
@entity118 rejected the offer , but said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for tuesday would be ' judgment day ' the protests began in late november when @entity12 shelved a long - awaited agreement to deepen ties with the 28 - nation @entity59 and sought a bailout loan from @entity53			0
the demonstrations grew in size and intensity after police violently dispersed two gatherings			0
demonstrators then set up a large tent camp on @entity24 's main square			0
after @entity12 approved the new anti-protest laws , demonstrations spread into other parts of the country , including to some cities in the @entity53 - speaking east , the base of @entity12 's support			0
fire : a demostrator walks near burning tyres during an anti-government protest in downtown @entity24			0
the protest movement is reportedly now spreading beyond the capital prayers : an orthodox priest stands between between police and protestors at the scene of anti-government demonstrations near @entity340 in @entity24 protesters have occupied @entity24 's city hall for nearly two months and turned it into a makeshift dormitory and headquarters			0
the government claims they are holding two police officers hostage fortifications : the protests began in late november when president @entity12 shelved a long - awaited agreement to deepen ties with the @entity59 spread : protests have now spread into other parts of the country , including to some cities in the @entity53 - speaking east , the base of @entity12 's support			2
