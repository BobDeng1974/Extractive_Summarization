scientists believe they are a step closer to understanding how the human mind ages after discovering a way to boost the number of brain cells in mice			1
researchers from @entity8 discovered that giving old mice blood from younger specimens resulted in a three-fold increase in the number of brain cells			2
they isolated the chemical eotaxin and discovered that injecting it into younger mice had the opposite effect , causing fewer brain cells to be produced			2
the research involved giving blood from younger mice to older specimens and vice versa the team are now testing eotaxin 's role in memory loss associated with alzheimer 's disease and hope their research might also prove useful in treating dementia			1
@entity29 , associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences at @entity8 and the study 's senior author , believes the findings raise the question of whether it might be possible to shield the human brain from aging			1
the experiment involved connecting the circulatory systems of pairs of young and old mice together			2
this produced changes in both brains , with the older mice producing more new nerve cells than would usually be expected			0
dr @entity48 , one of the researchers involved in the study , said : ' with this technique , we could examine the effects of old mice 's blood on young mice 's brains , and vice versa			1
' his colleague professor @entity29 explained : ' we saw a threefold increase in the number of new nerve cells being generated in old mice exposed to this ' younger ' environment			0
' in contrast , the younger members of the pairs showed fewer new nerve cells in the brain that normal , reports journal nature			0
hopes : the team believe the research could provide a better understanding of memory loss in humans associated with @entity78 's disease to establish what was behind the changes , the scientists first looked an exchange of cells between the paired mice by highlighting cells and tracking their progress			1
but they were not found to effect the brains			0
with cell exchange ruled out , they looked at immune signaling proteins in the mice 's blood , and found six which were present in both young mice paired with old mice and old mice on their own			1
at the top of the list was eotaxin , a small protein that attracts certain types of immune cells to areas where it has been secreted by other types of cells , and which , in humans , is associated with allergic responses and asthma			0
tests the team carried out on blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples drawn from healthy people between the ages of 20 and 90 showed a parallel age - related increase in eotaxin			0
when normal young adult mice were given eotaxin injections into their brain , memory was imparied and fewer nerve cells were produced			0
countering the effects if eotaxin could slow or reverse the ageing of the brain , say the researchers			0
a spokesman said : ' the group is now testing eotaxin 's potential role in memory loss associated with alzheimer 's disease , and is developing expanded blood - protein assays in a hunt for ' rejuvenating ' factors in blood that may prove useful in treating dementia and , perhaps , slowing the aging process in older brains			1

*groundbreaking* research could provide a key to the treatment or *prevention* of @entity78 's disease
