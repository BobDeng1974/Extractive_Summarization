by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:51 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 8 february 2013 a healthcare assistant at scandal - hit @entity5 dragged a frail dementia patient around by his pyjamas and called him an ‘ animal ’ , investigators have said			1
@entity11 allegedly pulled the 73 - year - old out of a toilet in a state of undress and told him she ‘ hated having to work with people like him ’			2
she will appear before the @entity19 next week to face charges that her aggression and treatment of the patient , who also has parkinson ’s disease , means she is not fit to practise			2
fears : @entity26 has ordered probes into five more trusts following the @entity30 scandal but expert @entity31 believes 21 more could be added to the list pressure : campaigners and members of the ' cure the @entity37 ' group outside the @entity38 after reading the findings of the @entity40 into the @entity41 @entity42 - born @entity11 is accused of shouting at him : ‘ you are no longer a human being but an animal			1
’ she is alleged to have said ‘ i hate you ’ or words to that effect			2
an inquiry found up to 1,200 patients died on casualty wards at @entity53 between 2005 and 2009 thanks to an obsession with @entity56 targets			1
the latest incident was in 2010 – one year after the period covered by the report – suggesting the problems could be continuing			2
last night it emerged that the @entity63 trust , which covers the hospital , was one of 100 who have still not signed an @entity68 pledge to improve dementia care			2
@entity70 , the charity ’s chief executive , said : ‘ the appalling failures at @entity73 affected people with dementia			0
‘ despite the government ’s prioritisation of the condition , some hospitals are still failing vulnerable people			0
' @entity81 stays in hospital can cause people ’s condition to worsen , rather than helping them to get well			0
‘ hospitals must act now to improve care for people with dementia			1
' only half of hospitals have made a commitment and we need @entity5 to be one of them to support improvement			0
' every day of inaction threatens more scandals of neglect and inappropriate treatment			0
’ the latest scandal to emerge is alleged to have happened on july 22 2010 , according to the @entity19 charge sheet			1
although she is a registered midwife , @entity42 - born @entity11 had been employed by the trust as a healthcare support worker since april 2009			0
the incident happened when she was on a night shift on ward six at @entity5			0
the sheet reveals that @entity11 continued to be employed at the trust for a further two months			0
her case will be heard on february 12			0
analysis suggests more than 4,000 patients a year are dying needlessly in the care of 26 @entity37 trusts			1
the study shows the scandal at @entity5 – where 1,200 are thought to have died through neglect – was not an isolated case			1
the figure of 26 represents one in six of the country ’s health trusts			1
@entity26 has responded to the crisis by ordering probes into five trusts with high mortality rates			1
but @entity31 , a globally - recognised expert on hospital performance , believes 21 more should be added to the list			1
to come up with that figure , the professor compared the numbers of patients who would normally be expected to die at a trust with the number of actual deaths			2
the ‘ normal ’ figure is based on admissions and illnesses			0
his technique – developed in the 1990s – led to the realisation in 2007 that too many patients were dying at @entity30			1
the head of the @entity37 was facing growing calls to step down yesterday			0
the investigator who carried out the original inquiry into @entity30 said sir @entity144 should go			1
@entity145 , who headed the 2009 @entity147 probe but has since joined the campaign group @entity148 the @entity37 , said : ‘ if this were a private sector organisation that had failed to such an extent , we would be calling for the boss to take responsibility			2
‘ there is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
