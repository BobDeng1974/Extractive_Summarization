no mechanical faults have been found on a plane that was forced to make an emergency landing when three passengers passed out and others felt sick			1
@entity6 flight 5622 was flying from @entity7 to @entity8 when the pilot was alerted to a potential loss of cabin pressure			1
as an increasing number of passengers began to complain of dizzyness , and three lost consciousness , the pilot plunged the aircraft into a terrifying dive to drop 30,000 feet in just eight minutes - before landing in @entity19 , @entity20			1
but despite the calamitous events , an investigation has discovered nothing unusual about the mechanics of the plane			1
she said that the plane did not land because of just one person 's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell passenger @entity43 said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane ' nosedived ' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes ' you could feel something in the air , something just was n't right , ' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes			1
passenger @entity54 , right , said : ' a lot of people with their heads down praying			0
it just felt like a re-enactment ' while federal safety officials had no explanation for what happened on the aircraft on wednesday , aviation experts said the flight crew did the right thing by quickly descending to an altitude with life - giving oxygen levels			1
the situation arose about an hour after take - off , when three passengers on the @entity73 175 twin - jet from @entity7 to @entity8 lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick			1
emergency nurse , @entity32 , said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint			2
' the flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out			2
i had to sit down			0
i was short - of - breath , light - headed [ and ] did n't feel great , ' said @entity32 to @entity86			2
initially , reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight , leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure			2
when the plane landed at 11.40am , the @entity92 issued a statement saying the crew ' reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency ' , shortly before landing in @entity19			1
however , in a second statement the @entity92 put out on wednesday afternoon , there was no mention of a ' pressurization ' issue			1
when contacted by the @entity104 to explain this , a spokesperson for the @entity92 would not say why the change was made			1
however , an official with knowledge of the incident told the @entity104 that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing ' rapid depressurization			0
' when the plane landed , @entity6 initially claimed that the aircraft landed ' out of an abundance of caution ' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane			1
late on wednesday , the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that ' a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight '			1
on landing this was declared untrue and @entity6 airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight			1
@entity6 spokeswoman @entity135 said : ' there were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent , but i ca n't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill. ' @entity6 added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft			1
nose dive : emergency vehicles surround a @entity6 plane , operating as @entity154 , that made an emergency landing at @entity156 on wednesday flight 5622 , from @entity7 to @entity158 , made an emergency landing in @entity19 passenger , @entity160 , 46 , told the @entity104 that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious			1
suddenly , the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over @entity169			2
' they said there was a pressure problem with the plane , ' he said			2
' there was no door flying open or anything like that			0
it was something very gradual			0
' @entity160 said that while the passengers were calm , he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made			2
' the way @entity6 is reporting it is that someone got sick , and they had to land , ' he told the @entity104			2
' but the way we understand it , they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane			0
' a nurse flying on the @entity73 twin - jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out			1
it was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks			0
' the passenger was lethargic			0
she was responding but her color was off			0
she did n't look good			0
we got her some oxygen			0
she was much more alert after getting the oxygen , ' the nurse , @entity32 , tells @entity86			0
@entity32 says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better			0
it was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out , as well			0
then @entity32 , herself , took a turn			0
