an underwater diver captures the only place on @entity2 where you can dive or snorkel between two continental plates , the @entity6 canyon in southern @entity7			1
the crystal clear waters flow within the crack between the @entity12 and @entity13 continents , which drift 2cm further apart each year			0
the stunning images were captured at 49ft during an expedition of @entity16 , by @entity18 marine biologist @entity17			1
submerged 49ft deep , a diver explores the pristine waters of the @entity6 canyon in southern @entity7			1
the canyon is a crack between the @entity12 and @entity13 continents and every year these two continental plates drift 2cm further apart the cold water temperature of between 2 and 4 degrees @entity27 , and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches @entity16 , result in the visibility of 100m @entity18 marine biologist @entity17 captured the images during a diving expedition through the freshwater @entity6 canyon , located in @entity16 , @entity7 the 40 - year - old , of @entity37 , @entity18 , says : ' i had the privilege to dive at the famous @entity6 dive site , probably the most impressive freshwater rift in @entity7			1
' it is without a doubt a world class dive site , with one of the clearest freshwaters on @entity2			0
' i felt hypnotised by the transparency , and it almost made me dizzy ! ' the cold water temperature , and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches @entity16 , result in the visibility of 100m			0
the water temperature ranges between 2 and 4 degrees @entity27 all year round , as a result of its source being the second largest ice cap in @entity7 , the nearby @entity57			0
@entity17 , 40 , of @entity37 , @entity18 , says : ' i had the privilege to dive at the famous @entity6 dive site , probably the most impressive freshwater rift in @entity7			1
i felt hypnotised by the transparency , and it almost made me dizzy ! ' @entity17 managed to use this visibility to capture the stunning shots between the two tectonic plates			2
he says : ' i did attempt to have a drink whilst diving in the lake , but the water temperature is about 2 or 3 degrees @entity27 , and you 're already frozen so you do n't really need more refreshing			0
' however , because of the lava filtration - which is one of the best in the world - the lake tastes of the purest of waters			2
' when people look at photographs , the first sentence is usually ' it looks like they were in weightlessness ' - a phenomenon which occurs when there is no force of support on your body			0
' the diver said he attempted to drink from the waters because of the extreme purity due to the lava filtration the water temperature ranges between 2 and 4 degrees @entity27 all year round , as a result of its source being the second largest ice cap in @entity7 , the nearby @entity57			2

@entity18 marine biologist @entity17 captured the stunning @entity6 canyon , southern @entity7
divers are able to explore the crack between continental plates that separate @entity12 and @entity101
cold temperatures and lava filtration cause the extreme *clarity* of the lake water
