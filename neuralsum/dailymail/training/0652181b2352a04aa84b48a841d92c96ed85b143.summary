over 10,000 @entity1 taxi drivers are planning a mass protest over a new app which encourages people to become their own taxi service			1
the @entity1 cabbies are planning to meet in june against the app by @entity8 at a @entity1 landmark , which has yet to be decided			1
@entity12 , the @entity13 ’ @entity11 ’s general secretary said cab drivers are against the @entity8 app because it allows drivers to carry passengers without following the same rules as other services , giving them an unfair advantage			1
@entity12 : the @entity11 's general secretary said the issues over the app are about a good old @entity26 sense of fair play ‘ all we ’re saying is if you want to come to @entity1 and operate the business model you ’re operating , you should operate within our laws , ’ @entity12 told @entity28			1
‘ this is about a good old @entity26 sense of fair play			0
’ however , the app looks set to shake up the taxi market as it has given private drivers the ability to charge for rides without the constraints that taxi drivers tend to face			1
the company was valued at $ 3.5billion last year after raising cash from @entity48 ’s venture - capital arm and private - equity firm @entity49			1
threat : @entity52 's app is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own taxi business @entity57 protest : cab drivers are against the app by @entity8 because it allows drivers to carry passengers without following the same rules as other services @entity52 is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own businesses by showing profiles of top drivers on its website			1
the website shows ordinary people like a single mother who used the app to start her own business to make money and a student who used the app to make money on weekends , along with a man who left his job to drive passengers around @entity85			2
it wants to show that ordinary drivers can become professional drivers without training , licencses or prior experience			2
@entity52 uses a phone 's gps to detect a location and connects them with the nearest available driver even if they do n't know the exact address			0
when a customer requests a ride , a driver will let them track their location on the map			0
@entity52 texts customers when their ride arrives			0
the driver ’s name and car details appear in the app , and they can message or call if they need to			2
customers can view rates in their city in the app and enter a pickup and drop - off locations to get a fare quote for the trip			1
uber users do n't need cash when they ride with @entity52			0
once they arrive at the destination , the fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file , and they e-mail a receipt			0
customers can split the fare with friends			0
other apps like @entity133 are slightly different to @entity52 as they recruit taxi drivers			1
but it has been met with fierce protest in different countries by taxi drivers who are upset that these drivers do not have to pay the same fees , permits or licences that taxi drivers do			1
in @entity145 , @entity145 president @entity144 attempted to impose a 15 - minute pickup delay on @entity52 and other private car services , which was struck down in february by the constitutional court			1
@entity150 drivers staged their own protest against the app by blocking traffic from airports expressing their frustration that the private taxi drivers do not have to buy a taxi permit that costs more than € 200,000			1
in @entity159 , the taxi association said that @entity52 hurt competition by violating rules that force limousine drivers to return to a base after delivering customers			2
in april , a court banned taxi services that use the app , though the injunction was n’t enforced at the time			2
cars in @entity170 that use the app will be subject to a € 10,000 ( $ 13,863 ) fine after a local court ruled against @entity8 cars last month			2
@entity175 vice president @entity174 called the ban ‘ crazy ’ and anti-competitive			0
but mr @entity12 said that @entity1 cab drivers like their @entity179 counterparts also see the app as unfair			1
crazy : @entity174 @entity175 vice president @entity174 called the bans in certain parts of the @entity184 ' crazy ' and anti-competitive ‘ for me to persuade 10,000 guys to take a day off work shows you the strength of feeling , ’ he said			0
‘ they ’re not a commercial threat to us			0
it ’s a sense of fair play			0
’ the @entity196 represents almost half of @entity1 ’s 24,000 cabbies who drive the city ’s black taxis			1
another sticking point over the app is that private hire vehicles , such as @entity52 ’s cars , are n’t allowed to have meters because they ’re pre-booked and can quote a fare in advance			2
the rule is meant to prevent companies from charging different amounts or surprising a passenger with an unexpected charge , he said			0
however , the @entity8 app does have a built in meter			0
@entity12 added : ‘ uber drivers also do n’t always have an operators ’ license , which means that they are n’t supposed to take customers ’ bookings themselves			0
' a spokesman for @entity52 said : ‘ @entity52 is pro rider and pro driver -- we are all about keeping @entity1 moving with our innovative app at great prices			1
’ the @entity85 based app has fought back against the backlash from cab drivers saying that it has all of the licenses needed for private hire cars in @entity1			1
@entity52 said it already provides a $ 1million commercial policy during trips and $ 1million of coverage for uninsured and under insured motorists			0
the firm said that it is abiding by @entity238 ’s rules and @entity238 said in a statement that @entity52 is eligible for a licence			0
but @entity52 is facing a growing barrage of criticism at home			0
commissioner @entity244 of the @entity245 said in a statement last month that the app was ‘ encouraging non-professional drivers to use their personal vehicles to drive passengers for a profit , a risk which personal automobile insurance simply does not cover			2

@entity1 cab drivers plan to **boycott** an app by @entity257
the app gives private drivers the ability to charge for rides - but they escape having to pay stiff fees for licences and permits
over 10,000 cabbies are expected to take part in the **boycott** in june
taxi drivers in @entity150 have already taken to the streets against the app
