by @entity1 reporter published : 10:04 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 10:04 est , 19 may 2013 battler : @entity3 , with her mother @entity4 , was given 10 months to live , but now she is on the road to recovery from a rare cancer a little girl with a terminal tumour who was told she had just ten months to live is on the road to an amazing recovery after battling the rare cancer			1
@entity3 , five , was diagnosed with a @entity14 tumour under her left armpit which had spread through her arm on @entity17			1
her parents had thought the mystery pain in her arm was a trapped nerve			2
but five months later , doctors finally revealed @entity22 had a cancerous tumour - and predicted she had just 10 months to live			1
only two children in the @entity25 are diagnosed each year with the rare cancer , which usually spreads from the kidney or brain - prompting @entity22 's grave prognosis			1
but the brave little girl has continued to battle the cancer and after months of chemotherapy , she is defying the odds and going from strength to strength			1
it has not spread to or from anywhere else in her body and the tumour has already reduced by 70 per cent			1
and doctors will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible next month - before ongoing chemotherapy is hoped to destroy it altogether			1
recovering : @entity3 is described by her mother @entity4 as ' our little miracle after fighting back against the cancer @entity3 's mum @entity4 , 35 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , said : ' the pain of hearing the news that our daughter had a rare form of cancer , with little hope of survival , broke us to the core			1
treatment : @entity3 in hospital where she has had months of chemotherapy that have reduced the tumour by 70 per cent ' you love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away			1
' but our little girl has defied the odds and we are astounded that despite her consultants ' fears , her tumour is actually shrinking			1
' to be even talking about surgery and physiotherapy is amazing - especially considering we were told she would n't survive the year			1
' it made us value our family and our time that we have together , we appreciate it more and we do n't take it for granted			0
' it has been a reminder of those things that are important			0
' when @entity3 left a summer fete with a mystery pain in her arm on the eve of her fifth birthday in july , @entity4 thought she 'd simply hurt it playing			0
but as her agonising pain worsened over the following months , her loving family - who thought she had trapped a muscle - were left baffled			0
they repeatedly returned to their gp as the pain killers did little to ease their little girl 's suffering			1
but it was not until @entity17 that @entity3 was finally diagnosed with a tumour			1
@entity4 , who also has a eight - year - old son @entity101 , added : ' it got to the point where we were having her sleep in our bed as she was just in so much pain			2
' i was told by doctors to give her pain relief medicine and to make sure she rested it			0
but when it got to @entity17 and she was still in agony , i just thought , ' i ca n't let her spend @entity17 like this '			0
' it was then a doctor noticed something was n't right and told us it was n't muscular and that we should take her to hospital straight away			0
devoted : @entity4 and @entity3			0
' you love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away , ' she says ' they did an ultra sound and an mri scan and that was when our whole world was turned upside down			2
' @entity3 was immediately put on a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at @entity135 in @entity48			2
doctors have been amazed at how well she has responded to treatment			2
her case is now being monitored by oncologists across @entity140			0
@entity4 added : ' @entity22 is a walking miracle and she has been so brave too			0
she coped so well with the injections , the needles , the chemotherapy and even losing her hair			2
' it 's been so hard on us all but we are getting there - and that 's mostly thanks to the inspirational strength our little miracle @entity22 has shown			0
' @entity4 's family and her friends are fundraising and have already raised Â£ 4,000 for the @entity154 in @entity135 and @entity155			0
they will also run @entity157 in @entity158 next month and the @entity159 in @entity160 in october			0
