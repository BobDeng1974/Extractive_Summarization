it hit headlines when princess @entity19 was pictured at a minefield in @entity21 , in 1997 , shortly before she died staff who have worked for the charity for more than seven years are eligible for its school fees scheme , but there are just three members of staff which qualify , including mr @entity12			1
the fees are paid for children between 10 and 18			0
mr @entity12 said : ' the advantage to the @entity6 of the remuneration package and the school fees allowance is actually that as employees [ and their children ] get older , it costs the charity less			1
' the board of trustees for @entity6 said : ' like some other charities and their senior executives , @entity12 is very much hands on and leads from the front putting his life in danger regularly , as he himself gets involved clearing landmines by hand , working , surveying and travelling in conflict and post-conflict countries such as @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity21 , @entity131 and the @entity132			2

the charity has had to remain competitive alongside our counterparts , such as the @entity154 , @entity155 and the @entity89			0
' as a result , we introduced a school fees scheme for senior staff with over seven years ’ service , and children from the age of 10 through to 18 are eligible and receive a percentage of their salary , which they put towards the part - payment of their children ’s education - this is a taxable benefit			2
' @entity12 ’s remuneration package as fully disclosed reflects the complexity and responsibility of his role , pay in comparable jobs , entitlements of subordinate staff , the amount of time he is expected to spend abroad , and the value he provides in driving the efficiency and productivity of the charity to the benefit of mine - impacted communities			1
' an ancillary benefit of the school fees scheme is that , as children come out of the education system , eligible senior staff ’s salary will reduce accordingly and therefore it is a more efficient approach in the longer term for the organisation			0
