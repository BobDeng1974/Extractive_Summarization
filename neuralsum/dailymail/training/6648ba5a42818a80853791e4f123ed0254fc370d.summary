’ from @entity8 to @entity1 : a sandstorm over @entity82 last week saw sand launched high into the atmosphere on the continent : @entity87 's car covered in sand at his home in @entity90 , western @entity91 , after rainfall which brought dust from the @entity5 @entity15 forecaster @entity94 said : ‘ this does happen - it has happened before			1

this sort of weather event happens several times a year , particularly in the summer , according to forecasters			0
' but you need the combination of elements - the sandstorm in the @entity5 region , the wind from the @entity115 , and the right sort of rain			1
‘ you need a light rain , not too much - just enough to bring it down and then when it dries out it leaves that residue on cars			0
it 's probably because the rain is not that heavy that it does not get brought down and washed off straight away			0
of course it is n't dangerous			0
‘ the most it 's going to be is an inconvenience to people who have it on their clean cars			0
