by @entity0 the ice cream truck jingle is the sound of innocent childhood summers and also the melody to the most racist song in the history of the @entity7			1
still to this day the familiar tune is responsible for setting off frenzied excitement among children across the country			0
popularly known as the 19th century standard ' @entity13 in the @entity14 ' , the song in fact owes its roots to minstrel song 's including the offensively titled , ' @entity19 ! @entity20 ! @entity20 ! ' racist history : the jingle played by most ice cream trucks is historically based on one of the most racist songs in the history on the @entity7 that song was directly spawned from another composition often performed in blackface called ' @entity30 * * * ' - which in turn lent its lyrics , but not the tune to the @entity34 winning popular song , ' @entity36			1
' the reason why a racist song has come to be so closely , albeit surreptitiously linked with ice cream trucks dates back to 19th century ice cream parlors			2
minstrel songs were the most popular form of entertainment at the time and therefore were played in these parlors , so when ice cream trucks appeared after @entity47 , the same songs people associated were played			2
an investigation by @entity50 discovered that the ice cream truck jingle , played by most , is directly linked to a song that was released in march 1916 by @entity53 , it was written by actor @entity54 and deeply rooted in racial ignorance			1
using a music hall call - and - response technique , @entity57 's lyrics were set to the melody of @entity13 in the @entity14 , which is turn dates back to an even older @entity62 song , ' the @entity63			0
' @entity57 : ' you n * * * * * s quit throwin ' them bones and come down and get your ice cream ! " black men : ( incredulously ) : ' @entity70 ? ! ? ' @entity57 : ' yes , ice cream ! colored man 's ice cream : watermelon ! ' the original song was brought to @entity7 shores by @entity78 and @entity79 immigrants who settled along the @entity80			1
offensive : the @entity30 * * * was a blackface character who parodied a free black man attempting to conform to white high society in the 1802s , the tune had its lyrics changed again for the ' @entity30 * * * ' song that was to be performed by a blackface character bearing the same name			2
he was meant to parody a black man attempting to conform to white society and became the counterpart to the dimwitted character living in the south known as @entity98			0
the two characters would interact in varying degrees of ignorant stereotypical styles of speech and song			0
indeed , for @entity105 , the author of @entity50 's report , his new found knowledge troubles him			0
' i can live with this , but what 's to be done on the summer day when my children 's eyes light up at the far - off sound of the familiar melody , and they dash in a frenzy toward me for change ? ' said @entity105			0
' do i empower them with the history of our country , or encourage the youthful exuberance induced by the ice cream truck ? is it my responsibility to foul the sweet taste of ice cream with their first taste of racism ? ' video courtesy @entity130			1
