by @entity0 most of us would try to avoid coming face to face with anyone who ’d hurt us			2
so the idea of meeting - and forgiving - your rapist is almost unthinkable			1

i did n’t want to go out			2
‘ for months and months afterwards i could still smell him			0
‘ if i was out and anybody looked at my personal space , i lost it			0
ms @entity14 was teaching the boy , who can not be named for legal reasons , at their school when he attacked her			1
‘ it was a normal monday morning and we ’d been on our own for 10 minutes , ’ she explains			0
‘ he lunged for me			0
i tried to get him off me , but he was so determined			0
‘ he raped me quite violently			2
i thought i was going to die that day			0
