by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 09:52 est , 23 july 2012 it is a forbidding place where temperatures reach a million degrees , and violent storms can cause havoc on @entity5			0
the representative - color images were made from observations of ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 19.3 nanometers ( 25 times shorter than the wavelength of visible light )			2
the 16 - megapixel images were captured by @entity21 's @entity20 , or @entity20 , which was launched on a sounding rocket on july 11th			1
the @entity20 telescope provides five times more detail than the next - best observations by @entity21 's @entity33			2
using a new mirror design , the @entity20 telescope is able to obtain images of structures as small as 135 miles across			2
@entity21 compares the advance to switching from ordinary cathode ray television to high - definition tv scientists say the new pictures could help us understand how the sun affects earth , before and after : these photos of the solar corona , or million - degree outer atmosphere , show the improvement in resolution offered by @entity21 's @entity20 , or @entity20 ( bottom ) , versus the @entity50 on @entity21 's @entity33 ( top )			1
' even though this mission was only a few minutes long , it marks a big breakthrough in coronal studies , ' said @entity57 astronomer @entity56 ( @entity58 ) , one of the lead investigators on the mission			0
since @entity20 rode on a suborbital rocket , its flight lasted for just 10 minutes			1
of that time , only about 330 seconds were spent taking data			0
" the @entity20 flight might be the most productive five minutes i 've ever spent , " understanding the @entity68 's activity and its effects on @entity5 's environment was the critical scientific objective of @entity20 , which provided unprecedented views of the dynamic activity and structure in the solar atmosphere			1
' the phrase ' think globally , act locally ' applies to the @entity68 too , ' said @entity56			1
' things happening at a small , local scale can impact the entire @entity68 and result in an eruption , ' explained @entity56			1
researchers with the hi - res @entity82 rocket that took stunning images of the sun 's corona the corona surrounds the visible surface of the @entity68 it is filled with million - degree ionized gas , or plasma , so hot that the light it emits is mainly at x-ray and extreme - ultraviolet wavelengths			1
for decades , solar scientists have been trying to understand why the corona is so hot , and why it erupts in violent solar flares and related blasts known as " coronal mass ejections , " which can produce harmful effects when they hit @entity5			0
the @entity20 telescope was designed and built to see the extremely fine structures thought to be responsible for the @entity68 's dynamic behavior			1
@entity20 focused on an active region on the @entity68 near sunspot @entity107 1520			1
the target , which was finalized on launch day , was selected specifically for its large size and active nature			0
the resulting high - resolution snapshots , at a wavelength of 19.3 nanometers ( 25 times shorter than the wavelength of visible light ) , reveal tangled magnetic fields channeling the solar plasma into a range of complex structures			0
the project was a collaboration between @entity123 , @entity21 and @entity57			0
dr @entity124 , university director of research at @entity123 , said : ' these first images taken by the @entity20 camera are truly awe - inspiring and have surpassed our expectations			0
' we are now able to analyse structural aspects of the @entity68 at a level of complexity we â€™ve never been able to achieve before			1
' the image quality is comparable to looking at a reflection in a steamed up mirror and then wiping it clean to reveal the true detail			0
' findings from the @entity139 will help us to understand the outer atmosphere of the @entity68 , learn more about the electrified gases that erupt from it along with the mechanisms that generate the energy it releases ; all of which have knock on effects on @entity5			2
' ' we have an exceptional instrument and launched at the right time , " said @entity149 , senior heliophysicist at @entity21 's @entity150			2
' because of the intense solar activity we 're seeing right now , we were able to clearly focus on a sizeable , active sunspot and achieve our imaging goals			0

new images show the @entity68 's corona up close for the first time
could reveal new clues to explain how how sunspots form
*experiment* lasted just five minutes
