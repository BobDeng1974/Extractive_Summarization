fishermen working off the coast of @entity2 have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago			1
the short , thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in @entity10 , according to anthropologists			1
the discovery suggests that it belonged to an previously unknown ancient human lineage			1
the fossilised lower jawbone ( above ) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of @entity2 experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in @entity10 until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago			1
the fossilised jawbone is the first ancient hominin remains to be found in @entity2			2
an ancient relative of humans has been dubbed ' @entity27 ' because of his powerful jaws and huge teeth			2
@entity30 lived in @entity31 more than one million years ago and lived side - by - side with direct ancestors of humans			1
it has long been assumed that this species lived on a diet of nuts , seeds and hard fruit because of its powerful jaw muscles and the biggest and flattest molars of any known hominid in the anthropological record			2
the latest research has compared the teeth of these ancient human relatives with those of modern sea otters - known for their ability to crack through the hard shells of mussels and other shellfish			1
dr @entity53 , a research fellow who led the study at the @entity55 and @entity56 , found that @entity30 had tooth enamel that was remarkably similar in structure to those of sea otters			0
tests on otter teeth suggest that the teeth of these ancient humans could have withstood extremely high pressures and could mean they had powerful bite capable of destroying bone , nuts and other hard foods			0
it was dredged up in a fishing net from the @entity72 submarine channel , about 15 miles ( 25km ) off the west coast of @entity2			1
during the @entity76 between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago , periods of low sea level would have meant the area was part of the mainland of @entity10			1
anthropologists from the @entity81 in @entity2 and the @entity82 in @entity83 who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread through out @entity10			1
homo erectus , remains of which have been found in @entity90 , @entity91 , and mainland @entity92 , tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth			1
researchers say that this suggests the robust - jawed ' @entity72 man ' had a different evolutionary origin from the ' classic ' homo erectus found in the area			1
it could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of @entity99			0
dr. @entity105 , an anthropologist at the @entity82 in @entity83 who was involved in the study , told @entity108 : ' it is a well - preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position			0
' what we can say is that it is clearly different from the known homo erectus populations from northern @entity92 and @entity90 , and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so			2
' he added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans			2
he said : '' the new @entity2 mandible is markedly different from us in robusticity , not size , of the mandible			0
' width of the bone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm ( 0.8 inches ) for @entity72 , but on average 14 mm ( 0.55 inches ) for fossil modern humans			2
' dr @entity132 , who led the research at the @entity81 , said the fossil appeared to have quite a primitive jaw but belonged to a now extinct species that most likely lived at a time when more anatomically modern humans were around			1
he said the fossil either belonged to a new type of ancient hominin not previously identified or was the result of more robustly jawed immigrants from @entity31 moving into the region			0
he added that the discovery also suggests that the traditional view of @entity99 as the only ancient human species living on the eastern @entity148 continent until the arrival of modern man is incorrect and it may have in fact shared the area with many other human lineages			1
the @entity72 mandible ( centre ) found off the coast of @entity2 is much larger than the lower jawbones of @entity99 from @entity90 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) , despite its much younger age according to the researchers the @entity160 ( seen above ) , where the jawbone was found , was once been part of mainland @entity10 dr @entity132 said most mandibles from @entity99 from the early and middle pleistocene in @entity10 had much thinner mandible bones and smaller molars			1
he said : ' several different models can be proposed to explain this situation			0
first , such morphology may be primitive retention from earlier @entity148 homo			0
' this hypothesis implies the presence of another longstanding @entity176 lineage in @entity10 that continued from the @entity177			0
' otherwise , there may have been a migration of robust - jawed @entity172 from @entity31 , possibly bringing along @entity181 stone tool technology around the terminal @entity177 , who later evolved some unique morphology locally			0
' both hypotheses cast doubt on the traditional view that h. erectus was the sole hominin species on the @entity148 continent in the @entity190 to early @entity191			0
' scientists used @entity193 to create the virtual reconstruction above of the jawbone discovered in @entity196 the teeth , seen here in ct scans , were much larger than those seen in other fossils but extensively worn the fossil was found by local fishermen when pulling up their nets , who then sold it to a local antique shop , where collector @entity208 purchased it			1
@entity208 donated his collection to the @entity81 in @entity2 , where dr @entity132 works			0
analysis of the fossil , published in the journal @entity215 , show that it is an almost complete right side of the mandible , with many of the molar and premolar teeth still in place			0
however , the molars were found to be extensively worn and scientists hope this may help to provide clues about what this ancient human species may have eaten			1
the wear also suggests that the jaw belonged to an older adult			0
the sockets where the incisor teeth would have sat could also be seen			0
although scientists struggled to accurately date the age of the fossilised jaw found off the coast of @entity2 , using sea level data and information about vegetation , they were able to estimate its age using isotopes found in the fossil			2
they say it is no older than 450,000 years and is probably younger than 190,000 years and could even be as young as 10,000 years old			0
with such a large age range , it is difficult to pin down exactly where in the evolutionary tree the fossil may fit and opens up the possibility that it may have come into contact with modern man , @entity253 , which moved into @entity10 around 55,000 - 40,000 years ago			1
scientists have yet to obtain dna from the fossilised jawbone , but if they were able to , this could help them work out which species it is most closely related to			0
during their study , the scientists found that the teeth are much larger than other homo erectus fossils found in @entity10 at the time when the new species is thought to have been alive			1
instead they more resembled the teeth of fossils that were 400,000 to 800,000 years old			0
in general the jaws and teeth of ancient human species grow smaller over time			1
yet this jaw was found to be much larger than those of other species living at the time			1
this graphic above shows how the @entity72 1 fossil may fit into the complex timeline of human evolution homo erectus remains , like the one above , have been dated to between 1.6 million and 500,000 years ago the scientists claim that it is similar to remains of another robust - jawed fossil , identified as an early @entity99 , in @entity283 , in the @entity284 of @entity286 new finding suggests that these may belong to another unique branch of the human tree			1
some anthropologists , however , believe that it may be the remains of a sister group of the @entity293 known as the @entity294 , which lived in @entity296			0
professor @entity297 , research leader in human origins at the @entity299 in @entity300 who was not involved in the latest study , said : ' this enigmatic fossil is difficult to classify , but it highlights the growing and not unexpected evidence of human diversity in the @entity307 , with the apparent co-existence of different lineages in the region prior to , and perhaps even contemporary with , the arrival of modern humans some 55,000 years ago			1
' he added : ' the jawbone also has some resemblances to even earlier h. erectus fossils from @entity31 , @entity90 and @entity316 ( in @entity317 ) , and to some homo heidelbergensis fossils from @entity31 and @entity319			0
' but it does not sit easily in the latter samples , nor with other later @entity323 archaic @entity92 fossils such as @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326			0
the new fossil had a larger and more powerful jaw than this forensic reconstruction of @entity99 ' one plausible comparison is with the @entity296 ' @entity294 ' , known from ancient @entity255 recovered from a fragmentary fossil finger bone and two very large molar teeth			2
' if @entity72 is indeed a long - awaited @entity294 jawbone , it looks more primitive than i would have expected			2
' other scientists have said that the fossil could be an unusually enlarged example from an existing species as skull sizes are known to vary considerably within species			2
dr @entity342 , principal lecturer in anthropology at @entity344 and vice president of the @entity346 , warned against rushing to attribute this fossil to a new species			0
he said : ' the discovery of this jaw in the fishing nets of a vessel off @entity2 while not a normal form of archaeological excavation is an exciting find			0
' while the authors of the paper suggest that it could represent a new species of @entity176 , because it ’s teeth are unlike other @entity148 homo erectus , we should be careful before adding this fossil to a new species and attaching it to the family tree			2
' the analysis of several homo erectus skulls from @entity316 in @entity317 published in 2013 show that a huge amount of variation can exist in one species and reminds us that we should always take care when dealing with isolated individual fossils			2

unusually thick lower jawbone with large teeth found 15 miles out to sea
fishermen working in the @entity72 channel off @entity2 found it in their nets
@entity383 is thought to be around 200,000 years old and is much larger than the mandibles of other ancient human species living in @entity10 at the time
experts believe it could belong to a previously unknown primitive human
homo erectus was thought to be the only ancient human living in the area
scientists say there may have been several species of early humans living in @entity10 until the arrival of modern humans around 55,000 years ago
some experts say the jawbone could also be from a large skull of a known species or provide evidence that a @entity408 - like species lived in @entity10
