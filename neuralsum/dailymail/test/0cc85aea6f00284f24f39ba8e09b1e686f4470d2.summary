both @entity0 and the @entity1 are furious with the @entity2 for allowing it to be known that the @entity1 trophy was being displayed on the centre circle at @entity6 on tuesday			1
there is great sensitivity at @entity0 about not presuming their title success before they are crowned champions and manager @entity13 has warned players and fans to concentrate on first beating @entity16 on sunday before celebrating			1
yet a 20 - strong stadium tour group at @entity0 clearly saw the @entity1 silverware on the pitch although a security guard attempted to cover it up to prevent photographs being taken			1
@entity23 celebrates against @entity24 as @entity0 took a step closer to the @entity1 title @entity13 has warned players and fans to concentrate on first beating @entity16 before celebrating the @entity1 had agreed to a request from the @entity2 to film the trophy at @entity6 to help with their programme preparation in advance of @entity0 ’s two games this week			1
but it was on the strict understanding that the big prize was not seen at @entity0 by members of the public , who would then assume the club were taking their @entity1 triumph for granted			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman said : ‘ we were filming a sequence for use in the event that @entity0 win the @entity1 and the footage will only air on that basis			1
we made every effort to ensure the trophy was n’t exposed to the public , but unfortunately it was briefly visible from a distance to a stadium tour			1
’ @entity0 allowed the @entity1 trophy , lifted by @entity56 in 2010 , to be displayed at @entity6 for the @entity2 on the strict understanding that the big prize was not seen by members of the public on thursday night , @entity58 received what is sure to be the first of a whole host of awards to mark his retirement as the greatest ever jump jockey when given the @entity66 ’s @entity65 to @entity68 accolade			1
the presentation was made by @entity70 , who opted to present the @entity71 rather than @entity58 ’s last @entity72 , and @entity73 , who was originally due to hand over the jockeys ’ championship trophy to @entity58 at @entity77 last saturday before being replaced by @entity78			2
recently retired jockey @entity58 was in attendance with his wife @entity80 for the @entity81 in @entity82 on thursday and received the @entity65 to @entity84 sport accolade there is still plenty of uncertainty around the exact responsibilities of the @entity90 director of cricket with only a skeleton job description having been sent out			0
and another win by @entity95 ’s side in the third test against @entity97 will further advance the view that the @entity99 should wait and see how the @entity101 and @entity102 series play out before making their choice			2
meanwhile , although new @entity99 chief executive @entity106 gives the early impression he has little or no time for the media , at least his director of communications appointment @entity109 has ordered daily newspapers to be delivered again to the @entity112 at @entity114 - certainly a step in the right direction			2
a sure sign that incoming @entity99 chairman @entity117 will want more transparency around the organisation is that the county he bankrolls , @entity121 , are allowing @entity123 cameras access to all areas — including team talks in the dressing room — for the duration of the season			0
the filming is for a behind - the - scenes documentary			2
@entity121 , bankrolled by @entity117 ( left ) , are allowing @entity123 cameras access to all areas for the season tigers target cup fans @entity24 are being provocative with their @entity135 planning at @entity136 after @entity137 2015 chose to stage two tournament matches at the nearby football stadium where the games are still a long way from selling out			0
tigers are putting on dinners , big - screen showings of matches , entertainment on @entity24 match days and even a rival fan zone to the official one in the city			0
both @entity137 2015 and @entity149 are annoyed with @entity24 ’ tactics			0
but with no major events legislation in place they are relying on @entity153 to halt the ambush marketing			0
meanwhile former @entity90 captain @entity155 , who runs his own business , is on @entity158 ’s radar as he is looking to set up an unofficial hospitality venue as close as he can to @entity160			0
the @entity162 tennis in @entity163 this week is being staged thanks to the patronage of football super-agent @entity166 who is leading a consortium that has rescued the event from closure			0
organisers did not have the funds to carry on the 25 - year - old tournament this year until tennis fan @entity166 , whose clients include @entity13 and @entity176 , became involved .			0

@entity0 agreed to request from @entity2 to film the trophy at @entity6
the @entity180 agreed on understanding public could not see the trophy
however , a 20 - strong stadium tour saw the silverware on the pitch
@entity0 can win the @entity1 with victory over @entity16
