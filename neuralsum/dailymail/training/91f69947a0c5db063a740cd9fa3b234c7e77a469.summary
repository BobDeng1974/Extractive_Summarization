@entity0 , 36 , pictured on today 's @entity1 where she admitted she 's a chocoholic many people will be giving up chocolate for @entity5 but for one mother , the sacrifice will be especially difficult as she currently eats the treat morning , noon and night			1
@entity0 , 36 , from @entity8 , appeared on today 's @entity1 where she revealed the full extent of her addiction			1
she said : ' i eat chocolate every day			0
i do n't just eat one bar or one bag			0
i 'll eat one and have another an hour later - family sized bags and bars , huge amounts of chocolate			1
' i eat amounts that would make others physically sick			2
' i 'll have it mid morning , lunch time , afternoon , evening and on the sofa at night			2
' @entity0 explained to presenters @entity26 and @entity28 that she has loved chocolate ' for as long as i can remember			1
' she said : ' i was brought up to eat healthily and chocolate was just a treat			2
' i used to be afraid of going to the dentist so i would be given it afterwards as a treat			0
when i moved out of home i started buying it for myself and it went from there			0
' she said she has no self - control when it comes to chocolate and she can consume a whole packet of chocolate biscuits or a chocolate cake in one sitting			1
' i do feel guilty afterwards but not for long , so then i eat it again , ' she said			0
while she was once successful in quitting smoking , she said attempts to give up chocolate have always failed			0
she said : '' it 's totally addictive to me , i do n't want to , there 's no reason for it but i ca n't stop eating chocolate			1
' people say " do n't keep it in the house , then you wo n't be able to eat it " but i 'll just drive to the shops and get some or eat it while i 'm at work			0
' as she approaches @entity64 , her ' favourite time of year ' because of all the chocolate eggs on offer , @entity0 said she wants to be able to give up the treat once and for all			1
she said she 's concerned about the effect her eating habits are having on her own health and the example she is setting her children			0
she said if she does n't have any in the house , she 'll just drive out to get some to satisfy her cravings she said : ' it ( chocolate ) is beautiful but it 's no good for me			0
i 'm trying to lead a healthier life , i have lost weight and started running but i ca n't get rid of it			0
' i 'm worried about the impact on my children , i control what they eat but my six - year - old already asks me for chocolate when she sees me eating it			1
it 's not good for the future in that sense			0
' she said she 'd also save money on her shopping bills if she was n't buying so much chocolate every week as she currently spends an ' awful ' amount			2
therapists the @entity107 on this morning said they would be able to stop @entity110 craving chocolate the @entity113 show introduced @entity0 to therapists the @entity107 who promised that they would be able to cure her using their techniques			1
remarkably , when @entity0 returned to the @entity1 sofa an hour later , she said she was a new woman			2
a plate of chocolate cakes and bars were brought out and offered to her but she said she was n't tempted at all			0
after a short session with the @entity107 , @entity0 was able to resist this plate of chocolate offered to her she said : ' i do n't want to look at it , it does n't appeal to me			1
' the mother cried in relief over the fact she no longer felt controlled by her need to eat chocolate			0
@entity130 and @entity131 said their techniques involved changing @entity0 's perception of chocolate and the way she associated with a reward			2
they wanted to replace how @entity0 felt about chocolate with how she felt about less appetising food - such as offal - so that just the thought of eating chocolate would become revolting			1
for anyone seeking to overcome an addiction to comfort eating , they recommend looking for alternatives so you do n't feel deprived ( eg replacing milk chocolate with dark chocolate or having chocolate sprinkles on a coffee rather than a chocolate bar ) , not buying the fattening products in the first place and not telling yourself you ' ca n't ' have something - as denial will make you crave it more .			1
