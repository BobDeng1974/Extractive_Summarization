it is a mission set to solve the mystery of what happened to the atmosphere on @entity4			1
@entity7 's @entity6 spacecraft has given scientists their first glimpse of the upper atmosphere of the red planet , which has baffled them for decades			2
it is hoped the craft can explain why the red planet lost most of its atmosphere			1
in this region , atoms that were once a part of carbon dioxide or water molecules near the surface can escape to space			0
these molecules control the climate , so following them allows us to understand the history of @entity4 over the last four billion years and to track the change from a warm and wet climate to the cold , dry climate we see today			2
@entity6 observed the edges of the @entity4 atmosphere using the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , which is sensitive to the sunlight reflected by these atoms			1
the first images from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) spacecraft has provided scientists their first look at a storm of energetic solar particles on @entity4			1
it has also produced unprecedented ultraviolet images of the tenuous oxygen , hydrogen , and carbon coronas surrounding the @entity4 , and yielded a comprehensive map of highly - variable ozone in the atmosphere underlying the coronas			1
the spacecraft , which entered @entity4 ' orbit sept. 21 , now is lowering its orbit and testing its instruments			2
@entity6 was launched to @entity4 in november 2013 , to help solve the mystery of how the @entity4 lost most of its atmosphere			1
' all the instruments are showing data quality that is better than anticipated at this early stage of the mission , ' said @entity75 , maven principal investigator at the @entity76			2
' all instruments have now been turned on -- although not yet fully checked out -- and are functioning nominally			0
' it 's turning out to be an easy and straightforward spacecraft to fly , at least so far			0
' it really looks as if we 're headed for an exciting science mission			0
' solar energetic particles ( @entity83 ) are streams of high - speed particles blasted from the sun during explosive solar activity like flares or coronal mass ejections ( @entity90 )			1
around @entity93 , @entity92 storms can damage the sensitive electronics on satellites			0
at @entity4 , they are thought to be one possible mechanism for driving atmospheric loss			2
a solar flare on sept. 26 produced a @entity90 that was observed by @entity7 satellites on both sides of the sun. computer models of the @entity90 propagation predicted the disturbance and the accompanying @entity106 would reach @entity4 on sept. 29			1
@entity6 's @entity108 instrument was able to observe the onset of the event that day			0
the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) instrument obtained these false - color images eight hours after the successful completion of @entity4 orbit insertion			1
the image shows the planet from an altitude of 36,500 km in three ultraviolet wavelength bands			0
@entity119 shows the ultraviolet light from the sun scattered from atomic hydrogen gas in an extended cloud that goes to thousands of kilometers above the planet 's surface			0
@entity126 shows a different wavelength of ultraviolet light that is primarily sunlight reflected off of atomic oxygen , showing the smaller oxygen cloud			0
@entity131 shows ultraviolet sunlight reflected from the planet 's surface ; the bright spot in the lower right is light reflected either from polar ice or clouds			0
' after traveling through interplanetary space , these energetic particles of mostly protons deposit their energy in the upper atmosphere of @entity4 , ' said @entity92 instrument lead @entity144 of the @entity146 at the @entity147			1
' a @entity92 event like this typically occurs every couple weeks			0
' once all the instruments are turned on , we expect to also be able to track the response of the upper atmosphere to them			0
' ' with these observations , @entity6 's @entity47 has obtained the most complete picture of the extended @entity4 upper atmosphere ever made , ' said @entity159 member @entity158 of the @entity76			1
' by measuring the extended upper atmosphere of the planet , @entity6 directly probes how these atoms escape to space			2
' the observations support our current understanding that the upper atmosphere of @entity4 , when compared to @entity167 and @entity93 , is only tenuously bound by the @entity4 's weak gravity			1
' there will be about two weeks of additional instrument calibration and testing before @entity6 starts its primary science mission			0
this includes an end - to - end test to transmit data between @entity7 's @entity176 on the surface of @entity4 and @entity93 using the @entity6 mission 's @entity179 telecommunications relay			1
the mission aims to start full science gathering in early to mid-november .			0

first images *reveal* storm of energetic solar particles on @entity4
hoped mission will explain how the *martian* atmosphere ' escaped ' leaving a *barren* planet
