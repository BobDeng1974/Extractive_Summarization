from the exasperatingly dull to the garishly kitsch , lunchboxes are not usually seen as a bastion of style			2
this may all be about to change , however , because today sees the launch of some seriously fashionable food receptacles			2
introducing the @entity7 , which claims to combine the everyday necessity of a lunchbox with the luxury of a designer bag			1
the @entity7 looks every part the normal designer bag but folds out into a lunch box making its debut at @entity19 the stylish sandwich bags have been created in a bid to encourage women to love their lunch			1
the @entity7 appears to be nothing more than a fashionable accessory but once unfolded it reveals itself as the perfect container for a packed lunch , including a square sandwich wallet			1
commissioned by the @entity29 and designed by up and coming handbag designer @entity30 of @entity31 , the limited edition bag provides fashion conscious women everywhere the chance to bring their lunch to work in a brand new design			1
a spokesman for the @entity29 laments the laments the absence of sandwiches in the modern fashion fan 's lunchbox and blames extreme food trends for the loss of interest in sandwiches : ' due to fad diets , women have forgotten about the benefits of eating bread			1
we want to remind women that sandwiches are a healthy , nutritious lunch option , and that they are back in fashion			2
' this is n't the first time gluten has invaded the catwalks of @entity19			0
last year saw the launch of @entity58 , where models were given the chance to hit the catwalk smelling of freshly made toast			0
the designer of the bag , @entity30 wants her creation to encourage women to eat more bread both ' the @entity7 ' and ' @entity58 ' were created as part of the @entity29 's @entity69 , which promotes bread in daily life			1
for @entity30 the design is a must have and she created the bag with herself in mind			1
' i love making sandwiches at home , because i know exactly what i 'm putting in them , so i know i 'm eating a healthy lunch			0
the idea to do this in style really inspired me			0
' the @entity7 is available in five unique colours , including pertunia ( pink ) , anemone ( dark blue ) , mertyl ( aqua green ) , seedem ( yellow ) and sky ( light blue )			1
dietitian @entity92 is also supporting the campaign and says that bread is not something to be frightened of			2
' @entity96 is an important part of a healthy balanced diet ; it 's high in fibre and calcium , and low in fat and calories - an average slice contains only 80 calories			0
' sliced bread is a great option if you 're looking after your figure , as it can really help with portion control by keeping track of exactly how many calories you are consuming per slice			2
if you 're trying to lose weight , it 's important to try and choose healthy fillings for your sandwich at lunch such as egg and cress , or chicken and salad			0
' the bags will be exhibited at @entity19 on the @entity31 's stand at @entity123			0
a limited run of @entity125 is available to order from today for fashionistas and lunch fans alike			0
