a @entity1 mp criticised the @entity2 energy secretary yesterday after he announced new green energy projects that will lead to higher bills			1
@entity5 said the five new offshore wind farms and three wood - burning plants would supply 2million homes , create 8,500 jobs and attract £ 12billion of private investment			1
but he was accused of exploiting the crisis in @entity12 , which he said highlighted the need to develop home - grown power , as a ‘ cover ’ for expensive projects			1
the government announced eight new renewable energy projects , m including four offshore wind sites ( file picture ) investors get a guaranteed price for the electricity they produce – around double the wholesale cost – some of which is added on to consumer electricity bills			1
mr @entity5 said the average bill increase would be £ 11 a year by 2020 – a 2 per cent rise – but insisted green energy would make power more affordable in the long term			1
however , the @entity36 think - tank and a source at one of the major electricity suppliers calculated the rise in bills from these projects would be around £ 20			2
@entity43 sources less than 1 per cent of its gas directly from @entity45 but , at peak times , gas of @entity45 origin is imported from countries such as @entity50			2
energy secretary @entity5 insisted prices would be higher without investment in green projects it comes to @entity55 via a pipeline through @entity12			1
the eight projects , which will power more than three million homes by producing @entity59 of electricity , are : mr @entity5 has accused @entity45 of ‘ holding the @entity61 to ransom ’ by threatening to increase its gas prices , and warned that @entity43 has to produce its own supply			1
@entity66 , a @entity1 member of the @entity67 , suggested the comments provided ‘ a bit of collateral cover ’ for putting up prices			0
the former trade minister said the rise was unacceptable for a single round of new contracts			0
he said : ‘ if you just add 2 per cent to bills , and the next batch adds 2 per cent , and so on , it soon adds up to what @entity80 might call a cost - of - living crisis			2
‘ clearly @entity55 as whole needs to become less dependent on @entity45 gas , but we need more of our own capacity , which will bring down costs			0
the way to do this is perhaps to go ahead with fracking			0
’ in an embarrassment for the energy secretary , the @entity94 power station in @entity95 , where one of the new projects is based , has announced plans to sue his department			1
only one of the two plants that it anticipated would be converted from coal to wood - chip was announced , and the firm ’s shares fell by 13 per cent			0
a spokesman said it would make a legal challenge			0
energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			2
even in the face of price hikes , shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			1
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price .			2

energy secretary *unveils* deal for eight new renewables *schemes*
government to guarantee price paid for power , *pushing* up bills
