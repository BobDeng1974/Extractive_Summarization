forgotten man @entity0 has insisted he never doubted himself after easing the pressure on beleaguered @entity3 boss @entity2 with a priceless winner			1
the 25 - year - old winger secured a 1 - 0 victory over the @entity7 with a decisive 71st - minute strike which underlined both the talent he has and the fact that it has remained largely unfulfilled during his time on @entity12			1
but former the @entity14 midfielder revealed he never lost faith in himself as he redoubled his efforts to to persuade @entity2 he still had a role to play at @entity18 after it appeared that his days in the @entity19 were over			1
i have been grinding quite a while for this and it 's just a great feeling at the moment			2
' i just kept on working hard			2
i know the most important thing is working when people do n't see you			0
' it 's easy to train when you have got the coaches patting you on the back , but these moments when you are by yourself are the moments when you really have to work hard and dig deep			0
' @entity0 appeared to be surplus to requirements at @entity18 ' as @entity2 re-shaped his squad during the summer , and he was not even on the plane when the @entity48 headed for @entity49 as part of their pre-season preparations			1
however , he was the toast of the @entity53 on saturday evening after finally ending the club 's wait for a first @entity57 win of the campaign at the eighth attempt , in the process sparing them from a worst ever start			2
@entity0 celebrates securing a precious three points with his @entity3 team - mates on saturday afternoon @entity0 : ' i just kept on working hard			1
i know the most important thing is working when people do n't see you ' on an eventful day on @entity12 - there are rarely any other kind - @entity0 and his team - mates had to wait an hour to set about their task after the dressing panels surrounding a newly - erected giant tv screen were loosened by the wind , requiring a speedy repair job by hastily - summoned engineers			1
thereafter , it proved far from straightforward as stubborn @entity23 defence and sub-standard finishing kept the scoreline unchanged until 19 minutes from time			2
@entity23 full - back @entity78 strode forward and unleashed a long - range shot which cannoned back off midfielder @entity81 and the ball dropped kindly for @entity83 , who fed @entity0 on the left			1
the winger , as he had done repeatedly during the game , exploited the space ahead of him at pace and cut inside before setting himself and blasting an unstoppable shot past keeper @entity25 and into the bottom corner , his first goal for almost two years and just his third for the club			2
@entity0 's strike prompted a huge sigh of relief , but it took a determined rearguard action to hang on to the points as @entity99 denied @entity100 and @entity101 blocked substitute @entity103 's last - ditch effort			1

we worked really hard in training and it was a tough situation			0
it was great to get the three points and we get a breather for the next game			0
' @entity23 boss @entity130 was frustrated by defeat , but confident his promoted team will improve as the season goes on			1
he said : ' i am very pleased with the group of players i have got			0
i know that they are very disappointed with aspects of certain performances , but we have given , for the most part this season so far , a very good account of ourselves and i think we are very capable			0
' we will get better , so that 's just part and parcel of dealing with the demands of a league which requires quality on lots of different levels			0
