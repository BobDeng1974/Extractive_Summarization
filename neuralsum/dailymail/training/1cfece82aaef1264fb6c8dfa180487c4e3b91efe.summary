the first of four rare ' blood moon ' eclipses is set to happen tonight			1
the event , known as a ' @entity4 ' , is believed to mark the the beginning of significant events - even the second coming of @entity7 to a @entity9 minority			2
however , for the rest of us , it means a unique spectacle as a total lunar eclipse tonight will turn the moon a burnt reddish orange			0
a previous total lunar eclipse as seen from @entity26 on december 21 , 2010 is pictured the four blood moons will occur in roughly six - month intervals on the following dates : april 15 , 2014 october 8 , 2014 april 4 , 2015 september 28 , 2015 the significance of the arrangement is that it happened exactly a week before the first of four dark red ' blood moons , ' which some @entity34 believe marks a cycle associated with the @entity37			1
although lunar eclipses happen multiple times in a year during a full moon , this eclipse will be a particularly unusual viewing opportunity for @entity22			1
since the @entity45 's @entity44 will be facing the moon during the eclipse , the continent will be in prime position to view it from start to finish			1
in addition , the eclipse will coincide with nighttime in @entity22			2
the entire continent wo n't be able to witness a full lunar eclipse in its entirety again until 2019			0
' sometimes they 'll happen and you 'll have to be somewhere else on @entity45 to see them , ' said @entity60 , @entity61 deputy project scientist at @entity63 's @entity62			2
' most [ residents ] of the continental @entity65 will be able to see the whole thing			0
' for those who are awake to watch the eclipse , which is scheduled to begin around 2:00 a.m. edt and last over three hours , @entity60 said there would be several changes people can witness			1
when the moon first enters the @entity45 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow will begin creeping across the moon			1
this will give the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
' eventually there will be a chunk of darkness eating the moon , ' @entity60 said			0
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity45			1
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the @entity92 is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it makes it appear red			2
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			1
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
the eclipse is scheduled to begin around 2:00 a.m. edt and last over three hours			1
when the moon first enters the @entity45 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow will begin creeping across the moon			1
this will give the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
at the eclipse 's peak , around 3:45 a.m. edt , the moon will enter the @entity45 's full shadow , the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity45 's atmosphere will scatter the sun 's red visible light , the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			1
as a result , the red light will reflect off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it			2
it 's not often that we get a chance to see our planet 's shadow , but a lunar eclipse gives us a fleeting glimpse			0
during these rare events , the full moon rapidly darkens and then glows red			1
though a lunar eclipse can be seen only at night , it 's worth staying up to catch the show			0
at the eclipse 's peak , around 3:45 a.m. edt , the moon will enter the @entity45 's full shadow , the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity45 's atmosphere will scatter the sun 's red visible light , the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			1
no show : the total eclipse is visible over most of @entity22 , but not in most of @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity23 , as explained by this map as a result , the red light will reflect off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it			1
' it 's a projection of all the @entity45 's sunsets and sunrises onto the moon , ' @entity60 said			2
' it 's a very subtle effect , and if any part of the moon is illuminated in the sun , you ca n't really see it			2
' ' they do n't happen all the time , and the sky has to be clear , ' @entity60 said			0
' it really gives you a chance to look at the moon changing			0
' however , some believe the eclipse has larger significance			0
the unusual alignment of the sun , @entity45 and @entity186 happened a week before the beginning of the astrological event that some believe is associated with the @entity37 @entity192 , a @entity9 pastor who has written a book on the @entity4 called ' @entity194 : something is about to @entity196 ' told the @entity197 that tuesday night marked the dawn of a ' hugely significant event ' for the world			1
' this is not something that some religious think tank has put together , ' the notoriously outspoken church founder said			0
' @entity63 has confirmed that the @entity4 has only happened three times in more than 500 years — and that it 's going to happen now			1
' also known as the ' @entity4 ' , since it involves four successive total ' blood - red ' lunar eclipses each followed by six full moons , @entity63 has confirmed it started tuesday night and will end on september 28 , 2015			1
in the 21st century , tetrads are a frequent occurrence , with nine sets in total , but this has not always been the case			0
from 1600 to 1900 , for example , there were none at all			0
the ' @entity4 , ' cycle began in april last year			2
it involves a series of four dark red ' blood moons			2
' at the end of the cycle in september 2015 , some believe the end of the world will happen the @entity226 in the @entity227 prophesied about the blood moons and the @entity37 : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity233 comes			1
' according to mr @entity192 , each time the @entity4 has happened during that time , there has been a significant religious event accompanied with it			2
in 1493 , the first @entity4 saw the expulsion of @entity237 by the @entity238			0
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity240 was founded			0
and the most recent one , in 1967 , happened during the @entity242 between @entity243 and @entity240			0
this graphic explains why @entity186 was so visible to the naked eye on tuesday night mr @entity192 said the the first of the blood moons will happen on april 15 , right in the middle of the @entity237 holiday of @entity250			1
the second , on october 8 , occurs during the feast of the @entity253			0
the third will be on april 4 , 2015 , also during @entity250			0
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , also during the @entity256 .			0

@entity258 will begin *tomorrow* morning at 2 a.m. edt
@entity22 will have prime viewing position
will be first of four blood red moon , followed by six full moons
the cycle finishes at the end of september 2015
it coincides with an alignment of @entity45 , @entity186 and the sun
the chance alignment has only happened three times in the last 500 years
some @entity34 believe the @entity4 is a signal the end of the world is near
