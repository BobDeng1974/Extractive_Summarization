as part of the plea deal , @entity12 's sentence could not exceed terms in a sealed agreement between defense lawyers and military attorneys			1

@entity12 's wife @entity61 has not been present during the court - martial proceedings in closing arguments , prosecutors argued @entity12 should be thrown out of the @entity33 and lose his military benefits , while the defense said that would harm his innocent wife and children the most			1

' it 's not just one mistake			0
not just one lapse in judgment			0
it was repeated , ' said prosecutor maj. @entity80			0

this was not the right case , ' @entity93 said			0
prosecutors did not ask the judge to send @entity12 to jail , even though the maximum penalty he faced on the charges to which he pleaded guilty was more than 20 years			1
the judge could have also dismissed @entity12 from the @entity33 , which would have likely wiped out his @entity115 health care and military retirement benefits			2

@entity12 had been accused of twice forcing the female captain to perform oral sex during their affair			0

' believe me when i tell you that the public humiliation and vilification he has endured are nothing compared to the private suffering and guilt that he lives with every day , ' wrote @entity144 , who has n't attended her husband 's hearings			1
@entity28 also broke down at several points as he read a statement to the judge , pausing to collect himself			0
he apologized to his family and the women with whom he admitted inappropriate relationships			1
' i 've been frustrated and angry , but i do n't have to look any further than the mirror for someone to blame , ' he said , noting the hearing came exactly two years after the captain came forward with allegations on march 19 , 2012 .			0
