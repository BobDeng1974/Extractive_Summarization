@entity0 have missed the boat for top midfield target @entity2 , amid claims in @entity5 that they failed with a near - £ 30million bid for the @entity8 powerhouse			1
sources close to the @entity8 board have told @entity11 that the offer was made on friday and that the answer from the @entity15 club effectively ended @entity0 's hopes of installing @entity2 as the midfield general they so desperately need			1
@entity8 bosses informed @entity0 they had set an august 15 deadline for reaching any agreement over a deal for @entity2 and that trying to negotiate so near to the transfer deadline would leave them insufficient time for recruiting an adequate replacement			1
it represents a massive blow for manager @entity44 , who wanted @entity2 's energy and physical presence to revitalise a pedestrian - looking midfield			0
@entity0 were held to a goalless draw at @entity49 on saturday to leave @entity50 still awaiting his first competitive victory in charge at @entity53			0
but the @entity54 was handed a major boost on monday morning when @entity0 won the race to sign @entity57 from @entity58 on a one - year loan			0
whole - hearted : @entity2 's ( centre ) energy and passion are sorely needed in @entity0 's midfield the striker will cost the club £ 12m for the year and the @entity67 star follows @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 as @entity0 's new signings this summer			2
the 28 - year - old has yet to agree personal terms on his move from @entity58 but that is expected to be a formality and he is on his way to @entity80 in a private jet .			0

@entity0 have failed in a bid to sign @entity2 from @entity8
@entity0 bid £ 30million for the @entity86 midfielder , according to sources at @entity8
the bid failed to leave @entity8 enough time to source a replacement
