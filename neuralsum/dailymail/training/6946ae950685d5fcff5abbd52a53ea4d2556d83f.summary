as a large light is wheeled into the room , 66 year old @entity1 's face suddenly lights up and a huge smile spreads across his face			1
the patient at @entity7 in @entity8 is one of the first in the world to be given a bionic eye - and cameras were there to capture the moment he saw for the first time in 30 years			1
as his wife rushed over to hug him , he told surgeons the good news , telling them ' yes ! oh my goodness , yes ! ' moments after surgeon 's pressed a button , activating @entity25 's newly implanted bionic eye			1
using wireless technology , a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses			1
its sophisticated features were further enhanced and marketed by a company called @entity46			2
on oct. 1 , 2014 , @entity25 became only the seventh person in the @entity48 to have a so - called bionic eye - an @entity34 – activated as a visual aid to send light signals to his brain			1
@entity27 , @entity28 , a retinal surgeon at the @entity7 , counted backward from three and pressed a button , activating @entity25 's newly implanted bionic eye			1
the device incorporates technology initially developed by researchers then at the @entity7 ; its sophisticated features were further enhanced and marketed by a company called @entity46			2
using wireless technology , a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses			1
@entity27 implanted the sensor on sept. 10 , and activated the device on three weeks later – to the sheer delight of @entity25 and his family			2
' can i kiss him ? ' his wife , @entity31 , exclaimed in the moment she heard him say he saw flashing lights for the first time			2
however , the device will not restore normal eyesight , but instead provide a visual aid that could help @entity25 distinguish a door from a wall , or a crosswalk painted in a roadway			0

@entity25 describes seeing flashes of light that are more intense when he aims the camera at lights or light - colored objects			2
during a clinic visit on monday , @entity25 described ' seeing ' sights he had long believed were past memories – a white duck swimming in a pond , the harvest moon , his wife 's yellow chrysanthemums			0
in a healthy eye , the rods and cones convert light into tiny electrochemical impulses that are sent through the optic nerve and into the brain , where they are decoded into images			1
if the photoreceptors no longer function correctly the first step in this process is disrupted , and the visual system can not transform light into images			2
the @entity113 ( " @entity34 " ) bypasses the damaged photoreceptors altogether			0
a miniature video camera housed in the patient ’s glasses captures a scene			0
the video is sent to a small patient - worn computer ( i.e. , the video processing unit – @entity122 ) where it is processed and transformed into instructions that are sent back to the glasses via a cable			0
these instructions are transmitted wirelessly to an antenna in the implant			0
the signals are then sent to the electrode array , which emits small pulses of electricity			2
these pulses bypass the damaged photoreceptors and stimulate the retina ’s remaining cells , which transmit the visual information along the optic nerve to the brain , creating the perception of patterns of light			1
patients learn to interpret these visual patterns			0
using wireless technology , a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses			1
@entity31 said her most cherished moment came while they were watching a football game on sunday			0
she was sitting in a dark chair , and her skin was enough of a contrast that @entity1 could see flashes			1
he reached out and touched her face			0
' it was just a beautiful touch , ' she said			0
@entity25 will return to the @entity7 regularly for additional training on the device , learning to discern shapes and objects from the flashes generated by the device			1
he said is eager to provide researchers with information they can use to enhance the technology , so that the next generation of patients will benefit from his pioneering effort			0
' i just wonder how i have been so lucky , ' he said			0
' why me ? but if i can use what i learn from this to help others with @entity181 , it will not just be for my benefit			0

66 year old @entity1 was blind for 30 years *due* to a *degenerative* *disease*
' bionic eye ' can send light signals to his brain
he can now discern *simple* shapes
