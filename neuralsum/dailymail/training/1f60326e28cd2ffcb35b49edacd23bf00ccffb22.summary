by @entity0 , political correspondent bottles of wine should be labelled with cigarette - style warnings to alert shoppers to the risks of drinking too much , according to mps			1
they said most @entity8 have a ‘ low understanding ’ of the health problems associated with alcohol , which contributes to cancer , heart disease and strokes , as well as liver disease			1
@entity16 , @entity17 chairman of the @entity18 on @entity19 , said it was time for ministers to impose standardised health warnings on beer , wine and spirits			1
however , she stopped short of recommending what she called ‘ shock and awe ’ tactics , similar to pictures on some packets of cigarettes showing diseased lungs			1
miss @entity16 said it was important that the warnings also contained the units and calorie content of the alcohol			1
professional women , whose levels of drinking have risen sharply in recent years , might be put off to learn there are around 700 calories in a bottle of wine , she said			0
last week the @entity58 reported that the government ’s health quango will tell @entity8 to avoid drinking alcohol on consecutive days			2
danger : the message would be similar to that on cigarette packets , but the print could be smaller @entity67 says a ‘ one day on , one day off ’ rule is needed because daily drinking is a key contributor to increased health risks			1
the @entity6 ’ report out today says most drinkers do not know there can be up to 2.5 units of alcohol in a pint of high - strength beer , or as many as nine units in a bottle of wine			2
‘ health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products , ’ the report says			2
‘ likewise , detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks			0
yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content			0
‘ in order to inform consumers about balanced risk , every alcohol label should include an evidence - based health warning as well as describing the product ’s nutritional , calorific and alcohol content			0
’ miss @entity16 said the size and wording of labels would be up for debate			1
the powerful drinks industry would object to health warnings , she said , but lack of awareness was leading to ‘ people regularly drinking far more than they should ’			0
although the label recommendation are still at the proposal stage , it will put further pressure on the government to act			0
a government spokesman said : ‘ we are taking action to give people better information about the impact drinking can have on your health			0
‘ through our @entity125 , the drinks industry has committed to putting unit and health messages on 80 per cent of all bottles and cans			0

*parliamentary* *group* on alcohol misuse said it was time to impose warnings
@entity17 chairman @entity16 said message would be stark : ' alcohol kills '
but they stop short of ' shock and awe ' tactics and text could be far smaller
