as sir @entity3 said this week , ‘ the best sports people in the world are n't normal people ’			1
@entity3 was talking in the context of the @entity6 controversy but he just as easily could have been referring to the author rivalling the former @entity9 batsman for the most explosive new sports book to have come out this week on a monday			2
@entity11 would probably admit to being a man of extremes			1
extremely talented , of course			2
there is a sense of warmth as well as self - deprecation ; a sense of humour as well as candid self - analysis			2
and an admission to suffering from the same anxieties , the same self - doubt , that trouble most of us at some point in our lives , if not for much of the time			0
this is not to ignore some of the of more controversial sections			0
we will still wince at his response to news of @entity56 ’s heart attack , just as we will remain uncomfortable with his lack of remorse for that horror challenge on @entity23			1
but we will also delight in the score - settling with sir @entity25 and the brutal , sometimes hilarious , assessment of people he has encountered over the years			1
that said , i ’ve always believed there is a degree of decency about @entity11 , even if i was only ever offered the briefest glimpse of his personality as his ghost for a short - lived newspaper column and the occasional interview			1
i ’d had my fair share of run - ins with him by the time we met in a @entity79 hotel in 2001 , where @entity80 were staying on a pre-season tour , to discuss how we would work together			2
regrets apologising to @entity25 does not regret his tackle on @entity85 told @entity25 ' we need f * * * * * * more ' would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity88 @entity90 @entity89 he had once torn into me for approaching him one morning at the @entity93 team hotel to request an interview			1
on another occasion for diverting my eyes from his stare , towards a team - mate clowning around behind him , during a conversation in a post-match interview zone			0
both times he complained of my bad manners amid a flurry of expletives			0
class of 92 @entity107 regret @entity25 wanted me to wear no 7 turned down @entity109 this summer re-opens feud with @entity25 the @entity93 team hotel incident was one he did return to the following day , approaching me in the same lobby and informing me he was now ready to do the interview			1
you would n’t call it an apology but it was rather like an incident that appears to have happened at an airport earlier this week			0
according to a @entity122 fanzine editor who contacted me via @entity123 , @entity11 cursed at a guy for taking a picture of him only to then agree to a photograph of them together			1
only recently i ran into a former @entity26 coach who only had good things to say about @entity11			1
the coach had been a member of @entity25 ’s staff when they won the @entity133 in 1999 , but had not received a @entity136 winners ’ medal when they were handed out that night in @entity137			1
@entity11 thought this was hugely unfair , and gave the coach his			1
@entity11 celebrates winning the @entity136 in 1999 - but did n't play in the final against @entity141 @entity11 gave his winners ' medal to a @entity26 coach , who had only good things to say about him the @entity146 midfielder celebrates with @entity147 after the final whistle at the @entity149 as a columnist , @entity11 had a very clear idea of how things were going to work			1
my only means of contacting him would be by fax. he would then reply by text , or occasionally with a call , but always with the number withheld			1
at a later date , for an interview after his sudden departure from the @entity160 in 2002 , i was given a home number			2
but he was quick to point out that , once our business had been concluded , the number would be changing			2
if he was n’t the easiest to get hold of , he remained a dream to work with ; even though he was being paid absolute peanuts for doing the fortnightly column			0
for @entity11 this particular exercise was n’t about the money			1
the opportunity had clearly appealed to him			0
it was decided we would always discuss the columns face - to - face , at a hotel in @entity177			0
and he was never late			0
if anything , he would be a little early			0
@entity11 was part of one of @entity80 's most successful teams , with the ' class of 92 ' prominent @entity11 ( left ) , here with @entity26 in @entity183 in 1999 , would never ask for a drink , and only took messages by fax and he would never take a drink ; even water			1
after three or four visits to the same hotel bar i insisted he let me buy a round because we could be there for a couple of hours without spending a penny			0
i bought him a water and he did n’t so much as lift the glass			0
not least his view on the sudden sale of @entity204 to @entity205			0
he might have been the captain of @entity80 but it did not stop him declaring that players can be treated like ‘ pieces of meat ’ by their clubs			2
given that @entity25 ’s son , @entity212 , had been involved in the deal as an agent , that would not have gone down well			1
sadly , after three or four columns i received a call from his lawyer saying he did not want to continue			0
the reason given was the red card he had received after clashing with @entity221 ’s @entity220			0
@entity11 's column was brilliant - he was fantastic talking about @entity204 's departure from @entity26 the piece was stopped as @entity11 did n't want to continue after clashing with @entity221 's @entity220 he was furious with himself for allowing @entity220 to provoke him and was certainly in no mood to reflect on the incident in his next column			1
but reading this new book i wonder if he also did n’t like the sense of routine			2
‘ i do n’t like it when companies become too comfortable with me , ’ he writes in reference to his television work			0
‘ i do n’t like feeling owned – it tightens the chest			0
if i ’m to be an employee , i want it to be for a club or a football organisation , not in media			0
’ beyond his family the game of football is his world , and this new role as deputy to @entity248 and @entity249 seems to be one he enjoys			0
he might be a natural leader but that story of the medal in @entity137 tells you how much importance he stores in a good coach			1
as a captain he must have been as inspiring as he could occasionally be terrifying			2
if @entity6 thinks @entity257 was an intimidating presence in the dressing room , heaven knows what he would have made of @entity261			0
but only now , only with the publication of this book , can we even begin to understand what actually makes the man tick			2
the media work does n't do anything for him : ' i do n't like it when companies become too comfortable with me ' @entity11 knows what a good coach means to a team , so will continue his hard work with @entity146 and @entity275 @entity261 releases second controversial autobiography @entity11 : @entity28 , published by @entity277 £ 20			1

@entity11 will release his autobiography @entity281 on *wednesday*
lack of remorse towards @entity23 and sir @entity25 in book
while ghost writing a feature in 2001 , i saw a glimpse of his personality
@entity11 gave his @entity136 winners ' medal ( 1999 ) to a coach , who had only good things to say about him
he would only contact via fax. . . or he would change his phone number
former @entity26 captain would never ask for a drink during our meetings
