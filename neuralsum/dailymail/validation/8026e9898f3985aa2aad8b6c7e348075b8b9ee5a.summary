@entity0 , the fraternity at the center of the racist @entity3 video , has its roots in the @entity5			1
' we came up from @entity8 land , ' says a ditty from an old songbook , boasting about @entity0 's success			1
now , nearly 160 years after its founding at the @entity14 , another song - this one chanted by members of the frat 's @entity3 chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the bad old times in the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group 's activities over the years			1
@entity0 officials insist the chant is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members			1
this is believed to be a portrait of the original founding members of the @entity0 fraternity in 1856 at the @entity14 @entity35 ( bottom row , second from right ) objected to the fraternity expanding @entity39 because he believed ' agitation ' over slavery would make it impossible for ' harmony ' though the fraternity has its own fraught racial history			1
members originally planned to keep the fraternity on in the @entity5			0
when the question of ' @entity52 ' was brought up , one charter member - later a @entity49 army surgeon - said he did n't think heading north was wise because ' the constant agitation of the slavery question ' would make getting along impossible			1
it is claimed that the fraternity did not invite a black member until 1966 - and it took one activist brother seven ballots and a threat to ban every other new pledge before the other brothers assented			1
in more recent years , fraternity chapters across the country have gotten into trouble over racial incidents - including a hip hop - themed ' cripmas party ' at @entity70 and an entire chapter being suspended at @entity72 at @entity73 in 2013 over allegations of racial insensitivity			1
if there are any other chapters that use the song , ' we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior , ' said @entity0 spokesman @entity85			1
the lyrics ' are so hateful and spiteful that it 's embarrassing to think that @entity0 members would even know the chant or how it goes , if they 've heard it			1
' the fraternity was also investigating reports of other @entity0 incidents that may have been tainted with racism , @entity85 said			1
outed : @entity94 was identified by his family on tuesday night			0
they apologized for his ' disgusting ' behavior			0
right , @entity94 - an accomplished golfer at his former school @entity100 - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo @entity102 , a @entity3 freshman from @entity103 , has been identified as the conductor leading the ' there will never be a n * * * * * in @entity108 ' chant on saturday @entity0 began on the @entity110 campus on march 9 , 1856 , a few months after @entity111 outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the @entity116			1
the initial members visualized ' a bond which would hold them together for all time , ' @entity117 wrote in a 1916 history of the fraternity			2
' so it came about that in the late hours of a stormy night , the friends met in the old southern mansion and by the flicker of dripping candles organized @entity0			2
' more chapters were soon launched in @entity130 , @entity131 and even @entity132 , at what is now @entity134			0
but the founders were n't interested in a national presence			0
according to @entity117 , it was their intention ' to confine the fraternity to the southern states			0
' when a @entity131 chapter member raised the topic of a ' @entity146 , ' charter member @entity141 - who later served as a surgeon in the @entity143 - responded that ' the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters , as it would preclude the possibility of harmony			1
' the @entity153 soon put an end to the internal debate			0
the fraternity 's charter was surrendered in 1861 because of the fighting			0
the @entity160 chapter was the only one to emerge from the war intact			0
@entity0 would not return to its birthplace until 1886 , after the reconstruction - era ban on ' secret societies ' was relaxed and the school 's trustees , in the words of @entity117 , repealed ' its obnoxious anti-fraternity laws			1
' in the meantime , the fraternity had granted its first @entity172 charter in 1883 to , of all schools , @entity174 — the abolitionist institution now known as @entity174			0
the editors of the @entity178 of @entity0 ' the first @entity180 - letter society founded in @entity8 to take permanent root ... ' even in those early years , the fraternity sought to prove that it 's more than just a provincial organization			1
the international headquarters of @entity0 is seen in @entity185 , @entity186			2
the organization re-located to @entity186 after being founded in @entity188 @entity0 was proud to claim president @entity189 as a member at @entity192 's @entity191 — even though it was an honorary initiation that came long after @entity189 's college days			1
in december 1930 , the fraternity dedicated its international headquarters in the @entity198 suburb of @entity185			0
but , like other fraternities @entity199 , @entity0 had not yet embraced racial diversity			2
in his 2013 book , ' @entity203 , ' attorney @entity202 claims credit for championing the bid of @entity207 , who he wrote was ' the first black man to ever receive a nomination for membership in @entity0 in the entire history of that old , traditional southern fraternity			1
' according to @entity202 , he was social chairman of @entity0 's @entity214 chapter in 1966			1
he and @entity207 , a defensive lineman on the @entity217 football team , both lived at @entity218 , and @entity207 's was the first name he called when it was time to vote for new members			0
on the first ballot , @entity202 said , @entity207 received three ' blackballs , ' or negative votes			0
@entity202 then announced he would blackball every other nominee until whoever had blocked @entity207 ' fessed up and gave us their reasons , ' he wrote			0
it took six more ballots for a member to admit that he was voting against @entity207 because he 'd heard that the @entity233 , @entity234 , native ' dated white women			1
' @entity202 said @entity207 's nomination was approved on the seventh ballot			0
but when @entity202 told him how the vote had gone down , he wrote , @entity207 declined the invitation			0
reached by telephone tuesday , @entity207 , who practices employment law in @entity132 , told @entity243 that he was n't really all that interested in joining a fraternity , especially if some members did n't want him			0
this is the @entity248 house			0
the fraternity was founded on this campus - though forced to shut down after the @entity153 ' i did n't want to be the sort of obsessive token negro that , wherever you could be the first black person to do something , you would do that just because you thought white people thought that would help move their organization ahead , ' he said			1
in a phone interview tuesday , @entity202 , who practices constitutional law and teaches at the @entity261 , @entity262 , said of the @entity3 video : ' that 's pretty stunning , actually			0
i 'm glad they shut that chapter down			0
' @entity85 , an @entity0 spokesman , was unable to say whether @entity207 was indeed the first black man formally invited to join a chapter			1
' only within the last couple of years has the organization started to track the ethnicity of people who join the organization , ' he said			0
@entity0 has had its share of controversy in more recent years			1
in 1988 , the founding chapter was suspended again — this time for violations of the university 's drug codes			2
the suspension was lifted two years later , only to be levied again in 1992 when the chapter failed to meet the goals outlined for reinstatement			2
most of the actions taken against @entity0 in the past have been for infractions of a non-racial nature			2
but the @entity3 video is not an isolated incident			0
last year , @entity0 reached what it called ' a historic milestone ' — becoming the first large national fraternity to eliminate the pledge process			2
' instead , we have implemented a holistic education known as the @entity297 , ' @entity0 says on its website			2
' it provides education throughout a member 's collegiate tenure and fosters both personal and professional development			0
' on its website , @entity0 says its mission , based on ideals set forth by the founders , is ' to promote the highest standards of friendship , scholarship , and service ... ' the fraternity 's creed , ' the true gentleman , ' specifies conduct that ' proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety			2
' on monday , the national organization suspended the @entity3 chapter for failing to live up to that creed .			2
