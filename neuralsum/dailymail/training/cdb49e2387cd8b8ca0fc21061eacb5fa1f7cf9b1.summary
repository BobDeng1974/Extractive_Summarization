by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:54 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 10 may 2012 president @entity3 's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage today sent shockwaves through the political world - and a boatload of cash into his campaign war chest			1
after @entity3 's shock announcement last night , his re-election crusade saw a massive spike in donations as gay donors lined up to pour money into his campaign			1
@entity19 reported that @entity3 's campaign collected an astonishing $ 1million within 90 minutes after the @entity22 interview aired			2
but while gay rights advocates applauded @entity3 's announcement on wednesday , @entity23 accused the commander - in - chief of pulling off a cynical political manoeuvre			1
@entity35 said in a statement : ' while president @entity3 has played politics on this issue , the @entity23 and our presumptive nominee @entity39 have been clear			1
' we support maintaining marriage between one man and one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that			2
' @entity3 's announcement yesterday opened up the first major battleground in this year 's election campaign			2
@entity39 himself did not swipe at @entity3 directly , but affirmed his own views on same - sex unions during an @entity55 campaign stop , saying : ' i believe that marriage is between a man and a woman			1
' historic : @entity3 is the first sitting @entity62 president to publicly support gay marriage			1
president @entity64 opposed it and president @entity66 signed the @entity67 into law @entity3 was also rebuked by @entity69 , who also accused the president of playing politics and questioned the timing of his remarks			1
@entity69 executive director @entity75 said in a statement : ' that the president has chosen today , when @entity78 @entity62 are mourning the passage of @entity80 , to finally speak up for marriage equality is offensive and callous			2
' @entity69 appreciate that president @entity3 has finally come in line with leaders like vice president @entity84 on this issue , but @entity78 @entity62 are right to be angry that this calculated announcement comes too late to be of any use to the people of @entity89 , or any of the other states that have addressed this issue on his watch			1
' this administration has manipulated @entity78 families for political gain as much as anybody , and after his campaign ’s ridiculous contortions to deny support for marriage equality this week he does not deserve praise for an announcement that comes a day late and a dollar short			0
' 1996 , running for @entity104 : ' i favor legalizing same - sex marriages , and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			2
' 2004 , running for @entity109 in @entity110 : ' my religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman , gay marriage is not a civil right			1
' 2008 , running for @entity62 president : ' i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman			2
as a @entity123 it 's also a sacred union			0
' 2010 , after @entity36 wave election : ' my feelings with this are constantly evolving , i struggle with this			0
' 2012 , running for reelection : ' i think same sex couples should be able to get married			0
' others , like house speaker @entity131 , said there are more pressing issues at hand			0
@entity131 told the @entity135 : ' i have always believed that marriage was between a man and a woman			0
but @entity23 here on @entity140 are focused in on the economy			0
' the president appears to be banking on the gay marriage issue , which is heavily supported by younger @entity62 , to mobilize the youth vote , which has become disaffected during his term in office			1
@entity3 had long been suspected of holding this view , but was thought to be afraid to make it public because of the political backlash			2
the revelation comes the day after voters in the key battleground state of @entity89 approved a strict new ban on same - sex marriage			2
the measure , which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples , passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote			0
' at a certain point i ’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , ' the president said			0
@entity3 claims the change is a personal one only , and that he he still believes the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states			1
currently , six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it			0
@entity3 said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage			1
' you know , @entity180 and @entity181 , they have friends whose parents are same - sex couples			1
there have been times where @entity187 and i have been sitting around the dinner table and we ’re talking about their friends and their parents and @entity180 and @entity181 , it would n’t dawn on them that somehow their friends ’ parents would be treated differently , ' he said			1
' it does n’t make sense to them and frankly , that ’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective			0
' @entity3 had been under intense pressure to clarify his view toward gay marriage after vice president @entity206 publicly announced he supported it on sunday			1
family affair : @entity3 said talking to his daughters , @entity181 and @entity180 , about their friends who have gay parents made him believe gays should be allowed to get married the @entity212 sought out the interview with @entity214 , the ' @entity215 ' host , to explain himself			1
parts of the interview will aired tonight on ' @entity218 ' and will also appear on thursday morning 's ' @entity215			0
' @entity214 , herself , has never married			0
@entity3 seems to be making an election - year political gamble by directly challenging @entity39 , his likely @entity36 opponent in november			1
' when these issues were raised in my state of @entity224 i indicated my view , which is i do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and i do n't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name , ' he told @entity232 in @entity233			0
' my view is that domestic partnership benefits , hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but the others are not			0
' it could be that @entity3 is hoping to use the issue to energize young voters , who support gay marriage by way margins			1
the president , himself , acknowledged the issue is a generational one			0
' you know when i go to college campuses , sometimes i talk to college republicans who think that i have terrible policies on the economy , on foreign policy , but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or , you know , believe in equality			0
they are much more comfortable with it , ' he said in the interview			0
last week , @entity39 's spokesman for foreign policy , @entity258 , quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay			1
recent polls show 50 per cent of @entity62 support gay marriage , but also reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions			2
this could explain plain why @entity89 's @entity80 1 , which changes the state constitution to prohibit gay marriage and partnership benefits to gay couples , won by such a wide margin among voters			1
@entity206 's remarks on sunday set the stage for @entity3 's announcement			2
' i am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men , women marrying women and heterosexual - men and women marrying - are entitled to the same exact rights , all the civil rights , all the civil liberties			0
and quite frankly , i do n’t see much of a distinction beyond that , ' @entity206 said on @entity290			0
the president signaled that he was open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his feelings on the issues were ' evolving			1
' ' i struggle with this , ' he famously said			0
since 2004 , @entity3 has opposed gay marriage , saying his beliefs were based on his @entity123 faith			1
as a presidential candidate he supported civil unions			0
however , this is n't the first time @entity3 has changed in mind on the issue			2
in 1996 , as an @entity104 candidate , he told a gay newspaper in @entity308 that he was in favor of legalizing same - sex marriage and ' would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			2
' watch video here :			0

@entity3 supported gay marriage in 1996 but later opposed it in 2004
@entity181 and @entity180 's friends , who have gay parents , helped change the president 's mind
@entity3 says issue should still be left up to the states
new position draws sharp contrast with republicans like @entity39 , who opposes same sex unions
