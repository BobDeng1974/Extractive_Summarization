@entity0 , 8 , pictured with her ' twin ' @entity2 - who was born in may last year these are the amazing twins who were born eight years apart			1
@entity0 and @entity4 were conceived at the same time with sperm that was frozen but @entity0 was born in may 2005 and her ‘ twin ’ brother was born in may last year			1
as she cuddled her newborn brother in the hospital , @entity0 told her parents that she had waited such a long time for his arrival			1
mother @entity13 , 48 , a nurse , said : ‘ they are theoretically twins because they were conceived at the same time - even though i gave birth to them eight years apart			2
‘ they were identical as newborn babies - both of them had a full head of black hair - but when people look at them now , they ca n’t believe that they were conceived at the same time , as @entity0 is eight years older than her brother			1
‘ when he arrived , she was so thrilled			2
she cuddled him and told my husband and i that she was so excited as she had waited so long for him to arrive			0
when they are older we will tell them of their remarkable start in life			0
’ mrs @entity0 and her husband @entity31 , 50 , also a nurse , who live in @entity32 , @entity33 , decided they wanted to start trying for a family in 1997 , two years after they had met			1
mr @entity4 had an operation to reverse a vasectomy operation that he ’d had previously , but it was n’t successful			0
in 2002 they decided to go and live in @entity41 for a year , and when they returned home they made an appointment with @entity47 fertility in @entity48			0
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ we really wanted a family and we were disappointed when the vasectomy reversal did n’t work			1
i ’d tried other methods too - like drinking soya milk and making sure my waist did n’t go beyond 30 inches			0
' i tried to have my body in as good a shape as possible to fall pregnant , but nothing was working			0
i thought i would never be a mum			0
’ in 2004 , they underwent ivf treatment and 24 embryos were produced from that treatment cycle			2
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ the doctor was surprised about how many good quality eggs and then embryos we had , as my age was against me			1
we ’d been told there was only about a 14 per cent chance of the treatment working because of how old i was			0
‘ so we were optimistic about the treatment			0
’ @entity13 with her two children			0
the mother and her husband @entity31 tried @entity74 in 2004 after several years of trying to conceive naturally the doctors put two embryos back into her womb and froze the remaining ones			1
mrs @entity0 discovered she was pregnant two weeks later			1
she said : ‘ we were thrilled when i discovered i was pregnant , but we tried not to get our hopes up as i knew there was a possibility i may miscarry because of my age			0
’ mrs @entity0 had to have an emergency caesarean when she was 33 weeks pregnant as her waters broke and she developed an infection			1
she said : ‘ it was frightening , but luckily the baby was healthy			0
i could n’t believe it , that after all this time , i was a mum at last			0
it was such an emotional moment when she was born			2
’ the couple decided to wait several years before trying for a brother or sister for @entity0			1
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ i wanted to enjoy being a mum to @entity0 for a while , and there is 11 years between my sister and i , so i was n’t in any hurry			1
’ in 2012 the couple returned to @entity47 fertility for a second course of @entity74 treatment			1
she said : ‘ we took @entity0 with us and the doctor was delighted to see her			2
they did warn us that we did n’t have a high chance of the treatment working			0
the thawing process combined with my age , as i was 47 by then , were all factors that would go against us			0
but we just had to hope that we would be as lucky as last time			0
’ the family pictured together at their home in @entity33			0
mrs @entity0 had 22 embryos frozen when she fell pregnant with @entity116 - two of which were used when the couple tried for their second child mrs @entity0 ’s remaining embryos were taken out the freezer , where they had been stored for the last seven years			1
only five survived the thawing process and only two were deemed good enough quality to put back into her womb			2
frozen embryos are usually stored for a standard of 10 years , according to the @entity128 which monitors @entity130 fertility clinics			1
but parents wanting to freeze eggs , sperm or embryos must sign consent forms before the process begins setting out how long they want them to be stored for and who is allowed to access them			2
she said : ‘ we only had one remaining chance with our embryos , so we had to keep our fingers crossed and hope for a miracle			2
’ amazingly she discovered she was pregnant two weeks later			2
the pregnancy went smoothly until 33 weeks when she started bleeding			2
she had an emergency caesarean four weeks later and @entity2 arrived into the world at @entity149 in @entity150 weighing @entity151 - exactly the same weight as a his ‘ twin ‘ sister eight years before			1
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ we were so surprised that they had been exactly the same weight - and they both had a head of black hair			1
as babies , they looked like two peas in a pod			0
’ @entity2 suffered from pneumonia when he was born and he had to stay on a ventilator in hospital for two weeks			1
but after his recovery he was allowed home			0
mrs @entity0 added : ‘ @entity0 ’s hair has turned fair now , and people are amazed when we tell them they were born exactly eight years and 16 days apart			1
she ’s so good with her little brother - but then as she keeps reminding us , she ’s waited long enough to meet him			0
