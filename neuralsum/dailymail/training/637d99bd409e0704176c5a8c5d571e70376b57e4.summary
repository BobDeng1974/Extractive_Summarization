a wolverine appears to be thriving in the northern @entity2 seven years after being confirmed as the first one in @entity4 since 1922 , researchers said			1
more than two dozen documented sightings of the solitary predator have occurred since it was first observed in march 2008 about 15 miles northwest of @entity8 , said @entity9 , a biologist with the @entity10			1
the same wolverine is believed to have been last detected in november by a motion - sensing camera in the @entity13 near @entity14 , which is only some 15 miles southwest of where it was originally seen			2
a wolverine appears to be thriving in the northern @entity2 seven years after being confirmed as the first one in @entity4 since 1922 , researchers said the male appears healthy with dense fur and ample weight , @entity9 said , and has staked out a 300 - square - mile swath of the @entity23 between @entity24 and @entity25 as its territory			1
' i think it 's exciting , ' he said			2
' it gives us some hope of bringing back some apex predators like that			0
it would be exciting to have wolverines back in the @entity23			1
' though its dna has been linked to wolverines in @entity41 's @entity40 , biologists are still unsure whether it wandered down to @entity4 or was released into the @entity23 by someone			1
positive identification of the wolverine spotted nov. 3 near @entity14 is pending genetic testing by the @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity49 , @entity50			0
some of its fur was obtained for the test			0
the male appears healthy with dense fur and ample weight , @entity9 said , and has staked out a 300 - square - mile swath of the @entity23 between @entity24 and @entity25 as its territory ' based on our history it 's most likely going to be the same individual , but our hope is it 's not , ' @entity9 said			1
' our hope is we have a pair here so they can mate ... we 're hoping that one animal turns into a population			0
' the odds are good over time that some wolverines will venture south to @entity4 from @entity41 and the @entity71 , he added			1
once found throughout the @entity23 and @entity73 , wolverines were wiped out across most of the @entity74 by the 1930s due to unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns , said @entity78 , a wolverine researcher with the @entity80			1
in the decades since , they largely have recovered in parts of the @entity83 , where 250 to 300 of the animals live , but not in other parts of their historical range			0
positive identification of the wolverine spotted nov. 3 near @entity14 is pending genetic testing by the @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity49 , @entity50 in the @entity92 , they live primarily in @entity93 , @entity41 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
larger populations persist in @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity4 has the habitat to support higher wolverine numbers , @entity9 said , and his agency has discussed the possibility of reintroducing them to the state			2
' they avoid residential areas and livestock			0
there 's not a lot of controversy with having wolverines around , ' he said			2
' how many pairs can the habitat support ? that 's the question			0
' the rarely seen members of the weasel family have a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to their size			0
adults are about as big as medium - size dogs .			0
