as former vice president @entity3 argued on sunday that the @entity5 's aggressive interrogation of terrorism suspects did not amount to torture , the man who provided the legal rationale for the program said that in some cases it had perhaps gone too far			1
former @entity11 lawyer @entity10 said the sleep deprivation , rectal feeding and other harsh treatment outlined in a @entity16 report last week could violate anti-torture laws			1
@entity10 said on @entity19 's ' @entity18 ' ' if these things happened as they â€™re described in the report , as you describe them , those were not authorized by the @entity11			1
they were not supposed to be done and those people who did those are at risk legally because they were acting outside their orders			0
the memo said only prolonged mental harm or serious physical injury , such as organ failure , violated the @entity45 's ban on torture			1
aggressive interrogation methods like waterboarding fell short of that mark			1
@entity10 's comments on sunday contrasted with those of @entity3 and former national security officials who invoke his memo to argue that the harsh treatment of detainees was legal			1
' they specifically authorized and okayed what we did , ' @entity3 said on @entity60 's ' @entity59			0
' ' no one tortured anybody else , ' former @entity5 counter terrorism head @entity61 said during his interview with @entity66 of ' @entity67 sunday			2
' the @entity69 's review of 6.3 million pages of @entity5 documents , released on tuesday , found that some captives were deprived of sleep for more than a week , at times with their hands shackled above their heads , while others were abused sexually			1
' looking at it now , i think of course you can do these things cumulatively or too much that it would cross the line of the anti-torture statute , ' @entity10 said on the @entity87 television network			2
former @entity5 counter terrorism head @entity61 ( seen in this file photo ) said sunday '' no one tortured anybody else ' he questioned whether the report 's findings were reliable , given it was produced only by @entity94 who had a political incentive to cherry - pick the worst examples			1
the report concluded the @entity5 misled the @entity99 and the public about the program and failed to disrupt a single plot			2
those findings have been disputed by former @entity5 officials			0
@entity3 said he was not concerned that the torture program ensnared victims of mistaken identity , and said he had no regrets			0
he said on @entity60 's ' @entity59 , ' ' i have no problem , as long as we achieve our objective			0
and our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11 , and it is to avoid another attack against the @entity116			0
i was prepared , and we did , we got the authorization from the president and the authorization from the @entity11 to go forward to the program			2
it worked now for 13 years			0
he continued ' we 've avoided another mass casualty attack against the @entity116 , we did capture @entity125 , we did capture an awful lot of the senior guys of @entity128 who were responsible for that attack on 9/11			0
i 'd do it again in a minute			0

former @entity11 lawyer @entity10 said the sleep deprivation , rectal feeding and other harsh treatment outlined in a @entity16 report last week could violate anti-torture laws
@entity10 was deputy assistant u.s. attorney general in the @entity34 in 2002
@entity10 co-wrote a memo that was used as the legal sanction for what the @entity5 called its program of enhanced interrogation techniques after the *september* 11 attacks
the memo said only prolonged mental harm or serious physical injury , such as organ failure , violated the @entity45 's ban on torture
aggressive interrogation methods like waterboarding fell short of that mark
