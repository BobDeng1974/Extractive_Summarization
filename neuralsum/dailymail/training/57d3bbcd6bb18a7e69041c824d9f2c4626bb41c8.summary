this couple never let their love life get in the way of their work - even when they perform their knife throwing double act			2
@entity9 and @entity10 , nicknamed @entity11 , put their relationship on the line every day during their high risk circus act with the @entity17			1
the pair , who live in @entity19 , have been together for six years and doing their hair - raising routine for the last three years			2
while trusting @entity10 stands motionless , or strapped to a revolving board , @entity9 takes her life in his hands by throwing sharp blades at her at top speed			1
@entity9 , 53 , was born into a circus family and has been performing life threatening tricks in the ring since he was just 17 years old			1
it was while @entity9 was working for the @entity45 in 2008 that he met his long - term girlfriend @entity10 , who had travelled to @entity47 to work as a dancer in the show			1
but they did n't take up the terrifying feat until @entity9 - who by then had retired from circus acts - was approached by a close friend who runs the famous @entity17 in 2011			1
@entity9 , a father - of - three , said : ' i think it works out better that we are in a relationship , there is a lot of trust between the two of us			2
outside the circus the pair , who met at the @entity66 , look like any other couple in love @entity11 was originally a dancer while @entity9 has been working in circuses since the age of 17 ' we make a great partnership - when you do knife throwing you have to go on stage feeling confident and focused			1
' but when we go on stage we both have to focus completely and forget anything that we have going on outside of work			0
' i know that she trusts me and i have been doing this act for such a long time that i do n't worry that i might miss and hit her			0
' when i was approached to go back to the circus , i said i would only do knife throwing again if @entity11 was my target girl			2
' we both enjoy the adrenaline rush			1
' the pair say that being a couple is beneficial to their act and that they enjoy the adrenaline rush it gives @entity11 , 28 , originally from @entity96 , said : ' when @entity9 first asked me to do this act with him it did n't take much convincing			1
' but that 's probably because he did n't really give me much choice			0
' we have been doing it for three years now and it definitely keeps our relationship interesting			0
' at the start of our relationship we used to argue before we went out on stage , and i used to worry about having him throw knives at me			0
' but i have never really worried about him hitting me with the knives , i have a lot of trust in him and he has been doing this act for a very long time			0
' he has told me before that he is more careful doing the act with me than he has been in the past			0
' but i do n't whether that 's because he is getting older , or because he loves me more			0
