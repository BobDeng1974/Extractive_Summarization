by @entity1 reporter published : 18:17 est , 13 february 2014 @entity3 : 18:22 est , 13 february 2014 zinc has long been seen as a supplement to a healthy diet , with claims that it has many positive effects , but now scientists believe that reducing zinc levels could lead to a new therapies for common disease cartilage can be destroyed by molecular changes involved in processing zinc , a naturally occurring metallic element , a new @entity15 study has found			1
this means that zinc - rich foods , including seafood , cocoa and chicken , could be causing the painful condition osteoarthritis			1
when the cartilage breaks down in osteoarthritis , the bones rub together , causing pain , swelling , and stiffness			0
osteoarthritis affects the joints and is the most common type of arthritis in the @entity34 , with around 1 million people seeing their gp about it every year			1
the @entity38 in @entity39 and @entity40 performs over 140,000 hip and knee replacement operations every year as a result , but almost any joint can be affected by the disease			0
however , there has been a lack of effective therapies for the disease because before now the underlying molecular causes have been unclear			1
but a new study revealed that osteoarthritis - related tissue damage is caused by a molecular pathway that is involved in regulating and responding to zinc levels inside of cartilage cells			1
a protein called @entity57 transports zinc inside these cells , setting off a cascade of molecular events that result in the destruction of cartilage tissue in mice			2
as a result , reducing zinc levels could lead to a new generation of therapies for osteoarthritis			1
@entity70 of the @entity71 in @entity72 said : ' no evidence available to date clearly indicated that zinc plays a causal role in osteoarthritis			2
' in our study , we revealed the entire series of molecular events in the osteoarthritis zinc pathway , from zinc influx into cells to cartilage destruction			2
' cutting down on foods that contain cocoa powder may be the key to reducing diseases like osteoarthritis chicken , one of the @entity34 food staples , might be a slight cause for diseases that can cause crippling joint pain , and in cutting down on them , people might be able to reduce the chances of developing the arthritic diseases later in life the tissue destruction is caused by proteins called ' matrix - degrading enzymes ' , which are produced by cartilage cells and are the key culprits responsible for degrading the extracellular matrix - the structural support system that surrounds cells and holds them together			1
seafood , such as salmon , and other fish , have been found as a strong source of zinc in our everyday diet because matrix - degrading enzymes require zinc to function , researchers suspected that zinc levels inside of cartilage cells may play a role in osteoarthritis			2
to examine the theory they first examined cartilage from osteoarthritis patients as well as a mouse model of the disease			0
they found abnormally high levels of a protein called @entity57 , which is embedded in the plasma membrane of cartilage cells and is involved in transporting zinc inside of these cells from the outside environment			0
zinc influx through @entity57 activated a protein called metal - regulatory transcription factor - 1 ( @entity136 ) , which in turn increased levels of matrix - degrading enzymes in cartilage cells			0
through genetic experiments in mice , the researchers showed that this zinc - @entity57 - @entity136 pathway plays a key role in causing osteoarthritis - related cartilage destruction			0
@entity70 said : ' our findings suggest that local depletion of zinc or pharmacological inhibition of @entity57 function or @entity136 activity in cartilage tissue would be effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of osteoarthritis			0
' we are hopeful that this research will lead to the discovery and rapid development of novel drugs to suppress the progression of this debilitating disease			0

@entity15 study reveals zinc rich foods could be the cause for osteoarthritis
osteoarthritis is the most common arthritis type in @entity34
the underlying molecular cause for arthritis has been unclear
reducing zinc levels could lead to a new therapies for common disease
