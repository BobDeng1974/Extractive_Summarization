by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 4 october 2013 around 20,000 mothers with young children have begun ‘ direct selling ’ jobs over the last year , with many saying they needed to earn money after the loss of their child benefit			1
the @entity9 said it has witnessed a 20 per cent jump in the number of working mothers over the last year , to a total of around 120,000			1
the work has been taken with companies such as @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 which sell to people directly , rather than using a shop			1
following a cut in child benefit more mothers are taking to direct selling as a way maintain their lifestyles for example , mothers might hold parties to sell the products , and receive a commission depending on how much they manage to sell			1
others use catalogues or door - to - door selling			2
when asked why they had decided to take the jobs , many said they urgently needed extra money to cope with the rising cost of living , made worse by the loss of child benefit			2
new rules , which came into effect in january , mean couples no longer receive child benefit if one of them earns more than £ 60,000 , and it begins to be cut once their salary is over £ 50,000			2
even for families who continue to receive the benefit , it has been frozen since 2010 at £ 20.30 per week for the first child and £ 13.40 for each subsequent child			0
@entity53 , general manager of @entity17 @entity54 , which makes everything from cosmetics to washing powder , said : ‘ the recent changes to child benefit have affected thousands of mums , while the rising cost of living continues to impact on families all over the county			1
‘ families are under increasing pressure at the moment			0
‘ we are continuing to see mums being attracted to direct selling as an alternative , and flexible way to generate an income in these difficult times			1
’ a total 120,000 mothers are now using direct selling as a way of boosting stretched home budgets direct selling is highly attractive to women , who represent around three - quarters of its workforce , because they can control when they work			1
many choose to work only while their children are at school , or only in the evenings when their children are asleep , allowing them to avoid the crippling cost of paying for childcare			0
@entity86 , director of the @entity9 , said : ‘ parents are often faced with an impossible choice			0
‘ they can return to work , often under difficult circumstances and face astronomical childcare costs , or they can stay at home resulting in no income			0
’ official figures from the @entity97 show how the number of working women is rising rapidly			1
more than seven in ten mothers who are married or living with a partner are working , the highest percentage since records began			1
over the last two years , around 200,000 women who are married or living with a partner and have young children have joined the workforce			2
this was larger than the total increase in working mothers which took place during the previous 15 years , according to the figures from the @entity97			1
mothers can find an office job difficult after childbirth and relish the flexibility of door - to - door sales the @entity9 said many mothers turn to direct selling due to the problems that they face after returning from maternity leave			1
many find flexible or part - time work is not available , or can only find part - time work which is badly paid and far below their skill level			0
many do go back to their job but find it is entirely incompatible with family life due to the rigidity of the hours that they are required to work , forcing them to miss important events , such as their children ’s nativity play or sports day			0
dame @entity137 , former director general of @entity138 highlighted this problem for mothers this week			2
she said : ‘ i had so many moments where i would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because i was at sports day			0
‘ it was perpetual really - you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office			0
‘ i still had to go home and explain to my child why i did n’t make it			0
‘ there were a number of things i missed - i wish i could go back too			0
when they were growing up i relied hugely on nannies and grannies			0
