fussy shoppers are a major cause of food waste , @entity0 claimed yesterday			2
the supermarket giant said @entity8 customers ‘ always pick the cream of the crop ’ , forcing it to bin thousands of tons of old or misshapen produce			1
its eastern @entity12 customers are , by contrast , more willing to accept less than perfect food			1
blamed : a spokesman for @entity0 supermarket said ' fussy ' customers are the main cause of wasted food confusing sell - by dates and promotions have been blamed for much of the growth in waste			1
but @entity24 , food sourcing director at @entity0 , told a @entity26 inquiry into the issue that customers were also at fault			1
even though @entity32 rules on misshapen fruit and veg were relaxed in 2009 , supermarkets still maintain the higher product standards			0
mr @entity24 said : ‘ the standards are there because that ’s what customers tell us they want in their perishable produce			1
@entity0 said its eastern @entity12 customers are , by contrast , more willing to accept less than perfect food ‘ customers naturally select , they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left			1
' then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old , ugly misshapen produce goes to waste			1
' customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better			2
that ’s a very difficult reality to us			0
’ mr @entity24 said @entity0 would try to persuade more people to buy misshapen fruit and vegetables , including by using more cut - price deals			2
he acknowledged the industry had a role in ‘ educating ’ people to accept that wonky carrots and blemished apples were ‘ perfectly good food ’			1
but he said the retailer sends much of its misshapen produce to its outlets in @entity75 , where customers on tighter budgets do not object			2
in october , @entity0 revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year			1
it found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin , including 68 per cent of bagged salads , half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes			1
much of the food is thrown away by customers but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long			1
@entity0 revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year two in five apples and a fifth of bananas are never eaten			1
the supermarket has now scrapped confusing ‘ display until ’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables , and ended buy one get one free offers on salads			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ we can put more misshapen products through our value range at better prices , we ’ve been doing that for years			2
there are opportunities to do more			0
‘ it ’s less easy to be flexible with the standard ranges , but we can be more flexible with the product that flushes through the stores at a good price for customers			2
‘ we do have a role to educate people			0
it ’s weak to just do what customers think			0
our role is to [ help them ] to make the right choices			0
’ small marks on the skin of fruits do not affect their flavour , but farmers complain that supermarkets will often reject blemished produce			0
apples with slight blemishes or russetting , which makes them too red for the supermarkets , are routinely rejected			0
other fruit is dumped for having small marks , despite the absence of any impact on taste			0
vegetables have to meet certain size and shape standards			0
farmers complain they can have up to 40 per cent of their crop rejected for ‘ cosmetic ’ reasons			1
food waste has risen sharply up the political agenda following a series of reports showing vast quantities of supermarket food are thrown away , either by customers or the stores themselves			1
@entity0 researchers found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin , including 68 per cent of bagged salads , half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes in january , the @entity160 said that up to half the food bought in the @entity162 was binned			1
it said the waste was being caused by poor storage , strict sell - by dates , bulk offers and consumer fussiness			0
last month the government ’s @entity169 said families waste £ 60 a month by throwing the equivalent of almost a meal a day into the bin			0
it said £ 12.5billion worth of food is wasted annually			2
experts blamed the throwaway culture but said shoppers were also confused by sell - by dates and tempted by offers to buy more food than they need			0
despite being a lunchtime favourite , 13 per cent of chicken which could have been eaten is also thrown out – the equivalent of 86million whole chickens a year			0
strict @entity32 rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables were relaxed following years of criticism			0
marketing standards detailing acceptable sizes and shapes were scrapped altogether for 26 types of produce , including carrots , cauliflowers , cucumbers , leeks , plums and onions			0
however they were kept in place for a number of popular items , including tomatoes , apples , grapes and pears – meaning that ‘ substandard ’ produce has to be specially labelled .			2
