@entity0 is lowering fares as a result of plunging international oil prices cutting its fuel costs , sparking hopes other carriers will follow suit			1
@entity0 has cut seat prices on flights from @entity10 to @entity11 by $ 40aus ( £ 20 ) for economy fares and $ 50aus ( £ 25 ) for business class			1
the decision comes after @entity15 cut a £ 10 fule surcharge in december , yet other airlines have not yet offered savings to customers			2
fare drop : @entity0 is cutting seat prices as a result of the plunging price of crude oil however few of the other major carriers are promising similar cuts @entity0 said today it was lowering fares in anticipation that fuel costs would continue to remain at lower levels than the record highs seen in recent years			1
a spokesman said : ' over the past 10 years , despite oil prices reaching some historic highs , domestic airfares in @entity10 have gone down more than 20 per cent , driven by strong competition in the market			1
' however , despite calls by politicians in the @entity41 , other airlines are yet to follow suit			0
they argue that buying fuel months and sometimes years in advance means they are yet to experience the saving caused by recent drops in oil price			1
@entity10 airline @entity50 said : ' the bottom line for consumers is that @entity50 fares already in the market are some of the cheapest in years			0
' oil prices have fallen by roughly 50 per cent in the past four months with barrels of crude trading for just $ 48 in @entity58 today			1
@entity41 chancellor @entity59 has called on to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices to their customers a spokesman for @entity15 said : ' as an airline , we buy our fuel months and years in advance which means that historically when we have had to increase our fuel surcharge this has not been at the same rate as oil costs have increased			1
' similarly , decreases in the price of crude oil do not lead to an immediate significant reduction in our on - going fuel costs			0
' we ’ll continue to monitor the situation and keep fuel surcharges under review to make them as affordable as possible			0
' similarly budget airline @entity82 say that as they too ' hedge ' the majority of their fuel they are yet to benefit from the fall in the price of crude			0
a spokesman said : ' as at 18 november 2014 , we had bought 80 per cent of our fuel until the end of september 2015 ( at $ 944 per metric tonne ) and 58 per cent for the period 1 october 2015 to 30 september 2016 ( at $ 921 per metric tonne ) so oil price fluctuations will only have an effect on less than 20 per cent of our fuel this financial year and less than half our fuel in our 2016 financial year			0
' in the @entity41 politicians are calling on companies to pass on the benefits of falling oil prices on to their customers earlier this month chancellor @entity59 tweeted : ' oil price was $ 53 pbl last night – lowest in 5yrs			2
vital this is passed on to families at petrol pumps , through utility bills and air fares			0
' and @entity110 treasury minister @entity109 has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six - year low			0
he said : ' consumers have suffered the pain of high oil prices , it ’s only right that companies and organisations do all they can to pass on as quickly as possible every last penny of oil price falls			2

@entity0 has slashed ticket prices for seats to @entity11 by up to £ 25
