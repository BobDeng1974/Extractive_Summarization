by @entity0 last updated at 6:37 pm on 2nd january 2012 wearing casual white attire , the two sons of former @entity3 president @entity2 leave court today after a new session of their trial in @entity8			1
@entity9 , the one - time heir - apparent , and @entity11 are accused of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year 's uprising that toppled @entity2 's 29 - year regime			1
earlier , their father , who faces the same charges , was wheeled into the court on a stretcher wearing dark sunglasses and covered in a green blanket			1
on trial with @entity2 are his two sons - @entity9 ( back ) , his one - time heir apparent , and @entity11 - seen here leaving the courthouse today @entity2 - who is suffering from a heart condition , according to his doctors and lawyers - faces charges of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year 's uprising that toppled his 29 - year regime			1
he is seen here outside the courthouse today the 83 - year - old , who was brought by helicopter to the courthouse from a hospital where he is being held in custody , is suffering from a heart condition , according to his doctors and lawyers			0
the trial has resumed amid speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen tried for killing @entity3 protesters could be a prelude to the dismissal of charges against the ousted leader			1
it began on august 3 but has since been bogged down in procedural matters , including a demand by lawyers for the victims that the presiding judge , @entity56 , be removed			0
that request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on			0
another @entity8 court on thursday acquitted five policemen of charges of killing five protesters during the uprising in the capital 's district of @entity66 last january and february			1
an @entity3 woman chants slogans in front of the courtroom in @entity8 where @entity2 's trial has resumed			1
the banners list the names of men killed during the uprising the court said three of the defendants were not at the site of the killings while the other two fired against protesters in self - defence			2
the ruling angered families of the victims			0
activists demanded that the killers be brought to justice and complained that similar cases are languishing in courts in several @entity3 cities			2
also on trial are the ousted leader 's former security chief and six top police commanders			0
@entity9 and @entity11 , who also stand accused of corruption , were brought up in the @entity97 district of @entity8			2
@entity9 went on to become a banker in @entity99 until returning to @entity3 in 1995			1
he climbed up the ranks to lead an influential government committee which instigated liberal economic reforms			0
@entity11 did not assume such a public role , but was alleged to have used his father 's status to become immensely rich through corrupt business enterprises			0
@entity108 supporters gather outside the @entity8 courthouse an @entity3 woman holds a banner with @entity113 writing that reads , ' martyr @entity114 , the blood of any martyr is respected ' in front of the courtroom the acquittal of the police officers in @entity66 and the relatively long time the @entity2 trial is taking before even starting to deal with the core of the charges against him have led many activists to brand the proceedings a farce , organised by the generals who took over power when the longtime leader was ousted			1
the generals are led by field marshal @entity132 , @entity2 's defence minister for the last 20 years he spent in office			0
the activists believe the generals remain beholden to the @entity2 regime , and only placed the former president and his two sons under arrest after mounting pressure by protesters			2
the mubaraks were arrested in april , two months after the ousting of the regime			0
activists believe this was long enough for the three to conceal evidence of their alleged involvement in either the killings or corruption .			0

@entity9 and @entity151 accused , along with their father , of complicity in killing protestors
ousted @entity3 leader turns up to court on stretcher wearing dark sunglasses and covered in blanket
