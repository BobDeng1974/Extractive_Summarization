in a one - time conservative ' red ' state whose map now looks pock - marked with ' blue ' enclaves , @entity4 , the former @entity5 chairman and long - time @entity7 confidante , won a close governor 's election tuesday that is expected to set the tone for broader political battles in 2014 and 2016			1
@entity4 , the fundraising envelope - pusher who cooked up the idea to sell access to the @entity16 under president @entity7 , is now positioned to navigate @entity17 into the @entity19 's column when @entity20 runs for the top job in 2016			1
the governor - elect had held solid double - digit polling leads over @entity24 , the state 's tea party - backed @entity25 attorney general			1
but ultimately fewer than 55,000 votes – out of more than 2.2 million cast – separated the two hard - charging men			2
it was a massive shift from 2009 , when @entity4 crashed and burned in a @entity5 primary because he was seen as a carpetbagger with no @entity17 ties			2
his campaign 's largest source of funding , the @entity59 @entity58 , is kept afloat mainly by @entity64 software tycoon @entity63 , who @entity66 records show ' bundled ' between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 in contributions toward president @entity47 's 2012 re-election			1
@entity63 was among three dozen such bundlers who scored invitations to the @entity72 on mar 14 , 2012 , honoring @entity74 prime minister @entity73			0
@entity53 ' @entity47 connection made some conservative strategists carp on tuesday night that he was a tool of @entity19 eager to split off enough republicans to deliver @entity4 a victory			1
' we 've seen this kind of spoiler effect before			0
remember @entity84 in 2000 ? ' a @entity25 adviser told @entity85 during a phone call from the state capitol of @entity88			2
' the whole @entity90 thing came down to 537 votes in @entity92 , and @entity84 got more than 97,000 votes there			0
if he does n't run in 2000 , @entity95 is president for at least four years			0
' @entity24 conceded the race along with his wife @entity97 and their family after returns showed he would fall less than 2.5 percentage points short @entity17 attorney general @entity24 came up short after a bruising campaign that pitted tea party @entity25 against the star power of both the @entity105 and the @entity106 @entity108 re-enactor @entity107 , a member of four different tea party organizations , waited with other @entity25 on tuesday night , only to learn that @entity24 would lose by a relative handful of votes @entity24 was the first state - level attorney general to initiate legal action against the @entity47 administration over the @entity114			1
he sought to leverage voter dissatisfaction with the failed rollout , tying @entity4 to it at every opportunity			0
@entity4 countered with a more devastating and costly avalanche of advertising that cast the @entity25 as an anti-female tea party stooge who would stand in the way of funding the kind of massive transportation projects that @entity49 commuters have demanded			1
@entity24 opposed it because it requires a tax increase			0
other ads hammered @entity24 for supporting ' personhood ' legislation through an anti-abortion movement that has raised the ire , and opened the pocketbook , of @entity136			0
' i think every single person in @entity17 is glad that the tv ads are now over , ' he quipped during his victory speech			0
' both candidates brought star power across the @entity143 to stump with them			0
@entity24 relied on tea party superstars like @entity64 sen. @entity146			1
@entity4 had the @entity106 and the @entity105			1
ultimately , the president and @entity4 tied @entity24 to other republicans who have caught most of the blame for october 's federal government shutdown			1
blue @entity17 : @entity4 ( r ) cracked a joke at @entity7 ( c ) and won approval from @entity154 senator @entity153 , himself a former @entity17 governor out of tea ? @entity64 sen. @entity146 ( r ) stumped for @entity24 and read @entity158 verses at the @entity159 , but complaints about the @entity47 administration 's ' hostility to religious liberty ' were n't enough pockets of blue : @entity24 won far more @entity17 counties than @entity4 , for the @entity167 swept the most populous urban and suburban areas including @entity88 and the @entity166 adjacent to @entity49 spoiler : @entity53 , the libertarian candidate for @entity170 , collected more than enough right - leaning votes to split the @entity25			1
his main financier was a top @entity47 contribution bundler dumbfounded : @entity25 partisans thought @entity24 had pulled off the upset of the year , with @entity114 driving down @entity19 ' poll numbers and the sting of the partial government shutdown in the rear - view mirror @entity17 's populous exurb counties , blue @entity5 oases in a sea of red , are packed with federal government workers who bore the brunt of temporary furloughs and other job insecurities in what is otherwise the most recession - proof industry in the @entity154 @entity24 committed several unforced political errors , including a 2012 interview in which he was thought to compare illegal immigrants to the rats that plague sections of @entity49 a protester calling for comprehensive immigration reform was removed from the stage before @entity24 gave his concession speech tuesday night			1
the defeated @entity25 candidate had a huge voter deficit among @entity201 talking during a radio interview about a pest - control law in the city that prevents the mass killing of rats , he said , ' it is worse than our immigration policy			2
you ca n't break up rat families ... and you ca n't even kill ' em. ' @entity25 spokesman @entity212 later told the @entity213 that @entity24 ' was talking about how disturbing it was that our laws treat rats better than people , because our laws let us break up immigrant families			0
' but @entity221 voters turned out in droves to support @entity4 on tuesday , with many convinced that his @entity25 opponent was anti-immigrant and anti-hispanic			2
both men had financial scandals to dodge			0
@entity4 was tied to an electric car company , @entity226 , that ran afoul of federal investigators			0
worse for his @entity17 image , the company had set up its production line in @entity232			0
and @entity24 was haplessly tied to the financial scandals the engulfed the current @entity25 governor , @entity234			2
a @entity234 funder who bought access with gifts to him and his wife – including at least one @entity240 watch – also gave @entity24 and his family the run of his lake home for complimentary vacations			0
@entity4 , like all @entity17 governors , will be a short - term winner : the state limits its top political executives to a single term in office .			1

@entity7 's @entity46 money man , @entity4 *dreamed* up a way to *tap* donors for more cash by offering them nights in the @entity16
his rise to the governor 's mansion in @entity88 will *cement* the @entity106 ' chances to turn @entity17 ' blue ' if – or when – @entity20 runs in 2016
the @entity105 and @entity106 stumped for @entity4 , helping him *overwhelm* state ag @entity24 's *reliance* on sen. @entity146 and other tea partiers
@entity4 's campaign vastly *outspent* the @entity25 on broadcast ads , including many that cast @entity24 as *anti-woman* and anti-hispanic
a third - party @entity59 candidate who ultimately split the @entity25 was funded by a top @entity47 campaign bundler , raising @entity25 ' cries of dirty pool
