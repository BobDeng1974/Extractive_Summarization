@entity0 has released an incredible image that shows the dizzying array of colours that can be seen emanating from the sun in wavelengths that can not be seen by the human eye			1
it was made possible by @entity0 's @entity8 , or @entity8 , using the wide range of wavelengths that the telescope can view			1
@entity8 converts the wavelengths into an image humans can see , and the light is colourised into a rainbow of colors			1
a composite image shows the many different wavelengths given off by the sun , usually invisible to the human eye taking a photo of the sun with a standard camera will provide a familiar image : a yellowish , featureless disk , perhaps a bit more red when near the horizon since the light must travel through more of @entity29 's atmosphere and consequently loses blue wavelengths before getting to the camera 's lens			1
the sun , in fact , emits light in all colours , but since yellow is the brightest wavelength from the sun , that is the colour we see with our naked eye - via the camera , since the sun should never be looked at directly			1
when all the visible colours come together , scientists call this ' white light '			0
335 angstroms : this wavelength also shows hotter , magnetically active regions in the corona 211 angstroms : this wavelength shows hotter , magnetically active regions in the sun 's corona we see the visible spectrum of light simply because the sun is made up of a hot gas – heat produces light just as it does in a light bulb			1
but when it comes to the shorter wavelengths , the sun sends out extreme ultraviolet light and x-rays because it is filled with many kinds of atoms , each of which give off light of a certain wavelength when they reach a certain temperature			1
not only does the sun contain many different atoms – helium , hydrogen , iron , for example - but also different kinds of each atom with different electrical charges , known as ions			2
each ion can emit light at specific wavelengths when it reaches a particular temperature			0
the left image highlights regions of the corona during a solar flare , while the one on the right shows light emitted from the chromosphere and transition region 131 angstroms : the hottest material in a flare the wavelengths @entity8 observes , measured in @entity97 ( a measurement used to express the sizes of atoms , molecules ) : 4500 : showing the sun 's surface or photosphere			1
1700 : shows surface of the sun , as well as a layer of the sun 's atmosphere called the chromosphere , which lies just above the photosphere and is where the temperature begins rising			2
1600 : shows a mixture between the upper photosphere and what 's called the transition region , a region between the chromosphere and the upper most layer of the sun 's atmosphere called the corona			2
the transition region is where the temperature rapidly rises			0
304 : this light is emitted from the chromosphere and transition region			0
171 : this wavelength shows the sun 's atmosphere , or corona , when it 's quiet			2
it also shows giant magnetic arcs known as coronal loops			0
193 : shows a slightly hotter region of the corona , and also the much hotter material of a solar flare			0
211 : this wavelength shows hotter , magnetically active regions in the sun 's corona			2
335 : this wavelength also shows hotter , magnetically active regions in the corona			0
94 : this highlights regions of the corona during a solar flare			0
131 : the hottest material in a flare			0
1700 angstroms : shows surface of the sun , as well as a layer of the sun 's atmosphere called the chromosphere , which lies just above the photosphere and is where the temperature begins rising how we see it : the left image incorporates a broad range of visible light			2
the one on the right shows a mixture between the upper photosphere and what 's called the transition region , a region between the chromosphere and the upper most layer of the sun 's atmosphere called the corona solar telescopes make use of this wavelength information in two ways			0
for one , certain instruments , known as spectrometers , observe many wavelengths of light simultaneously and can measure how much of each wavelength of light is present			0
different wavelengths convey information about different components of the sun 's surface and atmosphere , so scientists use them to paint a full picture of our constantly changing and varying star			1
by examining pictures of the sun in a variety of wavelengths – as is done not only by @entity8 , but also by @entity0 's @entity201 , its @entity202 and the @entity204 / @entity203 - scientists can track how particles and heat move through the sun 's atmosphere .			1

the sun is filled with many atoms which give off various wavelengths
@entity8 converts these wavelengths into images the human eye can see
