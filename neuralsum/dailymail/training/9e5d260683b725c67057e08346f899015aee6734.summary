by @entity1 reporter published : 13:37 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 15:25 est , 8 january 2014 @entity4 cameras have caught footage of what could be @entity8 's most desperate robber			1
the ham - fisted thief was filmed trying to smash his way through a @entity13 's toughened glass screen and two reinforced doors before clambering through a ceiling to snatch just a few pounds from the counter			1
moments earlier he was seen pacing up and down the street in @entity20 , near @entity21 , @entity22 , where he was overheard muttering , ' i have no money - may as well do the @entity13 '			1
first he tried to pull open the door to the back			0
finding it unsurprisingly locked , he turned to the cashiers and demanded they hand over the cash , vainly punching the reinforced glass screen			0
next he picked up a plastic national lottery ticket stand and tried to use it as a battering ram to shatter the toughened glass screen			0
when that failed , he vainly tried again to open the secure doors to the back , trying to kick his way through one of them			0
and finally he climbed onto a shelf and started pulling polystyrene tiles from the false ceiling			0
despite almost getting stuck when his legs fell through the ceiling frame , the determined robber was able to clamber through the roof void as staff cowered in a back room after activating a panic alarm			0
he eventually grabbed an undisclosed quantity of cash which had been left on the counter , understood to be a small amount , before making good his escape - leaving a trail of debris in his wake			2
@entity82 today issued @entity4 of the raid at 11am on @entity84 , calling the two minute hold - up ' hamfisted ' and an ' act of desperation			1
' officers believe the man was seen before the robbery outside the @entity13 , where he made several comments about his financial position , including comments about not being able to buy @entity84 presents for children			1
police described balaclava - clad bandit as white , of a pale complexion , about six foot tall , and in his 20s			2
he was also said to have wide , pale blue eyes and was wearing a black woollen balaclava , blue tracksuit and thick black gloves			0
a cunning plan : the thief realises that he might be able to gain access to the back via the roof a breakthrough : after removing several tiles he makes his way into the ceiling void not quite plain sailing : before he can get in , the robbers legs fall through the fragile polystyrene tiles a not so clean getaway : after snatching some money , he makes his escape - leaving a trail of debris behind detective constable @entity123 said : ' this cctv paints perfectly the picture of just how desperate this man was to get his hands on some cash			1
' i believe he has made a spur of the moment decision to rob the @entity13 , and has executed his plan in a rushed and ham - fisted manner			2
' we believe he was pacing about beforehand and making several comments about his dire financial position and inability to afford @entity84 gifts			1
' if you were outside and saw or spoke to this person we really need to hear from you			0
' we also need to hear from anyone who knows who the person responsible is or who , having viewed the @entity4 , recognises someone from the build of the man , the way he has walked or the clothing worn			2
