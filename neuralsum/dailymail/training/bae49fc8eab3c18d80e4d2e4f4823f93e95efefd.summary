by @entity1 reporter published : 23:43 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 14 august 2013 hopes were dashed tuesday when a decades old @entity4 quadruple murder investigation ended when authorities concluded there was no link between their case and the killings dramatized in the book in @entity11			1
the convicted killers , @entity13 and @entity14 , were long suspected in the slayings of @entity16 , his wife , @entity17 , and their two children			1
the family was killed in december of 1959 , about a month after @entity13 and @entity14 murdered a @entity21 farmer and his family			1
investigators were unable to make a dna match between @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity25 , who was raped and had semen on her underwear			1
cold case ? @entity16 and @entity25 were murdered in their @entity4 home along with their children in a crime long connected to @entity35 murderers @entity13 and @entity14 two families ? @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , fled to @entity4 after murdering a family in @entity21 and some believe they killed again authorities said they were unable to match the dna because only partial profiles could be taken from the exhumed bodies in december , and the @entity16 crime scene samples were old and degraded			1
no more tests were scheduled			0
‘ the complication lies in the fact that there 's still some uncertainty , ’ @entity45 said			2
‘ it would n't exclude them but it also does not provide us with any level of confidence to say there 's a match because there 's not			2
’ police still believe the two men were likely involved			0
‘ we 're not closing the case , ’ @entity45 said			0
‘ it remains an unsolved murder			2
the mystery continues and we 'll look for other opportunities			0
we 've reached a point where we do n't believe we 're going to accomplish that through dna testing			0
’ testing decades - old dna can be difficult , said dr. @entity68 , the laboratory director of the @entity69 in @entity70			0
red herring ? @entity13 and @entity14 's remains were exhumed om 2012 and their dna taken			1
however , time had degraded the samples taken from the @entity4 crime scene in 1959 too much to place them at the scene slain : @entity17 and @entity16 met as teenagers , they were murdered in 1959 , along with their two young children unsolved : @entity17 twirled ropes at the local rodeo as a teen and @entity16 roped calves			1
their 1959 murder remains unsolved he said genetic evidence can degrade over time			2
how much dna was retrieved from samples , how it was stored and the conditions it was exposed to all play a role in whether a full dna profile can be collected			0
he said testing a partial dna profile would be like looking at a fingerprint that did n't have all the swirls			0
‘ the ability to make a match with an individual would be compromised , ’ @entity68 said			0
‘ it 's not uncommon for this to happen with a sample that old			0
’ @entity13 and @entity14 fled to @entity4 after killing prominent @entity21 farmer @entity35 , his wife and two of their children			1
cleared ? @entity13 and @entity14 were cleared of the crime after their capture in 1960 for the @entity21 murders of the @entity113 family , but experts have since called the lie detector results of the day useless @entity116 befriended the killers to write his groundbreaking , novel - like book about the @entity21 murders the murders in @entity122 , @entity21 , were chronicled in @entity116 's book , which gripped readers with its vivid narrative of the @entity113 family life and the tormented inner workings of the killers ' minds			1
the book detailed the murders , the trial and the killers ' execution			0
the two men — who were drifters — were eventually captured in @entity136			0
a polygraph test cleared them of the @entity16 murders			2
but in 1987 , a polygraph expert said those tests in the early 1960s were worthless			0
@entity142 took a fresh look at the @entity16 murders and wanted to test the killers ' dna			2
@entity13 and @entity14 killed the @entity113 family on nov. 15 , 1959 , and took off to @entity4 in a stolen car			1
they were spotted at least a dozen times from @entity150 to @entity151 and points in between			0
on dec. 19 , the two men checked out of a @entity154 motel			0
the @entity16 family was killed that day at their home on a ranch in the small community of @entity159 about four hours northwest of @entity151			1
@entity16 was shot to death and his wife was beaten , raped and shot			2
three - year - old @entity163 was shot to death and his 2 - year - old sister was shot and drowned in a bathtub			0
news stories at the time noted that there were gifts around the tree			0
in @entity11 : @entity13 and @entity14 killed the @entity113 family , pictured , in their own @entity122 , @entity21 home in 1959 siblings : @entity35 , 16 ( left ) , and her 15 - year - old brother @entity35 were killed with their parents in @entity21 in 1959 , a quadruple homicide documented in @entity116 's in cold blood but never connected to the @entity182 murders in @entity159 , @entity4 connected ? the caskets containing the bodies of the @entity113 family are loaded into hearses			1
many hoped their murders could be connected to the @entity188 ' in @entity4 , but those hopes have been dashed at some point on the same day , @entity13 and @entity14 bought items at a @entity193 department store			1
on dec. 21 , witnesses say they spoke with @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity150			1
@entity142 said the @entity188 had been considering buying a 1956 @entity195 , which was the kind of car @entity13 and @entity14 had stolen and were driving through @entity4			1
@entity142 thinks that somehow , the @entity188 and the killers met because of the car			0
the detective found witness statements — and talked to people who are still alive — who said they saw @entity13 and @entity14 in the @entity193 area around the time of the @entity16 murders			1
in @entity11 mentions the @entity16 killings in a short passage ; capote incorrectly states that the slayings occurred near @entity150 , @entity4 , about five hours north of the actual scene			1
he also relates a conversation between @entity212 and @entity13 on a beach in @entity151 , and has @entity13 speculating that ‘ a lunatic ’ copied the @entity21 killings			2
the book says that in reply , @entity14 ‘ shrugged and grinned and trotted down to the ocean 's edge			2

@entity17 and @entity16 were killed along with their two children in their @entity159 , @entity4 home
@entity13 and @entity14 fled to @entity4 after killing a family of four in @entity21 , as documented in @entity116 's @entity35
@entity13 and @entity14 have long been connected with the @entity4 murder but dna evidence has been *deemed* *insufficient* to draw any *conlusions*
