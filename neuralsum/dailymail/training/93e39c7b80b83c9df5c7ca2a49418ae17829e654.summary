one such comment , as picked out by @entity6 , was : ' do n't get me wrong , this t - shirt is ace			1
i just ca n't help thinking an additional @entity43 would n't go a miss. ' ( p.s i 've rated this 4 stars			0
1 for each @entity43 and 1 for the moon			0
if the seller wants another star , then i want another @entity43 ...			0
or another moon ) ' other well - known reviews include this effort for a box canvas print of @entity23 : ' if you only buy one 20 inch canvas print of @entity23 this year , this is the one to get			1

this canvas clock of @entity57 actress @entity56 received some memorable reviews this t - shirt of three wolves howling at the moon has become so famous it has sparked its own internet meme it 's design and function inspired one customer to write this glowing review : ' thanks to this revolutionary idea i can now purchase bananas free of fear			1

one review for mr @entity109 begins : ' @entity127 ' first work , and regarded by many as his masterpiece , mr @entity109 is something of a rarity amongst the @entity120 books			0
elsewhere , we see much exposition on the pitfalls of excess - such as in mr @entity136 and mr @entity137 , for instance - but a distinct lack of discourse on personalities that are over- rather than under - regulated ... ' so what a glorious anomaly we find in mr @entity109 - a breath of fresh air from the unrestrained id			2

on the first day when i excitedly unwrapped my pen ( thanks for the high quality packaging @entity6 ! ) i just could n't contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on , like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen , the post-it notes next to the phone , and on my favourite lined @entity173 pad at the side of my desk			2
