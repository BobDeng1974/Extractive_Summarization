by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 5 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:46 est , 5 february 2014 the story of @entity4 has been told so often , most famously in the 1967 film starring @entity6 and @entity7 ; creating an original story based on the couple is seems almost impossible			1
and yet , a new mini-series charting the lives of the gun - toting pair not only breathes new life into their legacy , it also demonstrates that the pair have as much appeal now as they did in their own lifetimes			2
as rising @entity27 star , @entity22 , who plays @entity23 in the new series , remarks , ' it ’s one of those stories that has so many layers of intrigue to it			1
it ’s just endlessly fascinating			0
' outlaws : @entity22 plays @entity34 and @entity35 plays @entity4 in the new mini-series based on the pair @entity37 : the real @entity4 photographed in 1933			1
they died the following year so who were the famous outlaws ? most agree that @entity4 were two gangsters who criss - crossed their way around @entity43 , looting banks and embarking on a two - year killing spree that resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people , including seven police officers			1
had they been imprisoned for their crimes their fame might not have spread , but instead they died in a hail of police gunfire – @entity34 was just 23 and @entity4 25 – thus cementing their fame for good			1
countless books , songs and even musicals have immortalised the couple ’s crimes , but it ’s the @entity65 - directed film , which saw both @entity6 and @entity7 earn @entity67 nominations , that the new series will be compared to			0
' well , ' says @entity22 , ' i ca n’t ever live up to @entity6 ! but our script seems quite different			1
we have four hours to tell a story , so we really get to know the characters , their motivations and the reasons for their actions , which stem from their childhoods			2
it ’s just very different			0
’ the mini-series , which also stars @entity35 as @entity4 , is indeed very different – the most notable difference coming from @entity22 ’s portrayal of @entity82 , dubbed @entity83 at the height of the couple ’s fame			1
while @entity6 exuded a worldly sexuality in her portrayal of @entity23 , 25 - year - old @entity22 ( whose previous roles include @entity90 in the 2012 film adaptation of @entity93 ’ @entity92 ) plays her at times with a wide - eyed innocence , which somehow makes @entity34 ’s crimes seem even more horrifying			1
during her research for the role , @entity22 read @entity34 ’s letters and diaries and admits that , ‘ while in the script she ’s sassy and confident , in her diary she comes across as a lost little girl who just needed to be loved			1
looks familiar ? @entity22 and @entity35 recreate the famous photo of @entity4 ( above ) for the show iconic : a scene from the 1978 film @entity4 , showing @entity6 and @entity7 memorable : according to @entity22 , @entity34 and @entity4 continue to fascinate as a child she would cry for her mother whenever the pair were separated , and even when she married at 15 – to small - time criminal @entity4 – her mother ended up moving in with them			1
' she was terrified of thunderstorms and did n’t like insects , so i liked the idea of this little girl who needed love and recognition			0
that was why she sought fame so much			0
’ the latest version tells the tale as a contemporary fable about @entity34 ’s desire for recognition			1
in one scene she reads a newspaper account of one of the couple ’s heists and frets endlessly about the unflattering photo of her , rather than about the shopkeeper they ’ve just killed in cold blood			0
‘ @entity34 ’s almost like a reality tv star in the way she wanted to be up there on the screen , ’ says @entity22			1
‘ the real @entity34 was an aspiring actress but never made it			1
back then in cinemas they used to show newsreels of @entity148 gangsters before they played the movies			0
' that was the reality tv of the time , and for @entity34 the next best thing to being a glamorous actress was a life of crime			1
today it would be @entity157			0
’ born in @entity158 in 1910 , @entity82 was just four when her father died and her mother @entity160 , played by @entity161 , raised her and her two siblings alone			0
but if her upbringing was poor , @entity163 ’s was even bleaker			0
living in the slums of @entity166 , @entity4 began his life as a petty criminal , stealing turkeys before progressing to holding up stores			2
by the time he met @entity34 at a party in 1930 , he had already had great experience of a life outside the law , yet because he had nice clothes ‘ and fancy cars ’ as she told friends later , she was n’t too concerned with his criminal tendencies			2
as she wrote in her diary , she was n’t ‘ going to sit back and let the world sweep by ’			0
the couple fell in love , in spite of her marriage , but within months @entity4 was in jail			2
rampage : the pair conducted a two - year crime spree with the help of the @entity191 gang before their deaths gruesome : @entity4 's jacket after the 1934 shootout that left the couple dead but immortalised their story when he got out he resolved never again to go back to prison and hit the road , taking @entity23 with him			1
over the next two years the couple rampaged their way across @entity43 ’s south - central states as part of the @entity205 – a group which also included @entity4 ’s older brother @entity208 and @entity208 ’s wife @entity209 – and the public became increasingly enthralled by their exploits			2
when a roll of camera film was discovered by police in one of the couple ’s abandoned hideouts , it featured a shot of @entity23 smoking a cigar , a gun nestling against her hip – the 30s version of the ‘ selfie ’			0
the image scandalised and titillated the public in equal measure , and saw @entity23 feature not only on the covers of true - crime magazines , but also more glamorous publications			0
the fame she ’d craved was hers at last			0
their spree ended when @entity4 and @entity236 , another member of the @entity205 , murdered two highway patrolmen in @entity238 , @entity158 on 1 april 1934			1
even though @entity236 later admitted the killings , his father alerted police to the whereabouts of @entity4 in exchange for leniency towards his son			1
sticky end : this photo shows the car in which the pair died			2
both were hit by more than 50 rounds each the couple were lured onto a deserted road outside @entity254 , @entity255 , and on 23 may 1934 , they came to a bloody end after being ambushed by six officers			0
they were shot more than 50 times without firing a round in return			0
some may criticise the continued glamourisation of the pair , but , says @entity22 , ' @entity4 were glamourising crime themselves – @entity34 would be on the run with her furs and heels			1
' but the ending is such an intensely gruesome and definite ending that it diminishes any glamour			0
' she adds : ' @entity34 was incredibly single - minded in her need for recognition and she trampled on everyone to get that			2
but there ’s a lot of vulnerability to her as well , so the juxtaposing of those two elements was interesting			0
' the tale of @entity4 has a @entity285 love story , it ’s got rebellion , it ’s got everything			2
it ’s a story that people never seem to tire of watching			0
’ @entity4 starts at 9pm on thursday 6 february on @entity290 ( @entity291 156 & @entity292 242 )			2
