two girls high school basketball teams have been suspended from a regional tournament after both of them tried to lose a game			1
the ridiculous game between @entity6 and @entity7 , both in @entity8 , took place on saturday in front of bemused spectators and referees			2
both teams knew that losing the game would mean avoiding having to play nationally - ranked @entity15 in an elimination match			1
the losing team would be placed on the other side of the regional bracket and would have a better chance of making it to the @entity23 finals			0
both teams had already been beaten by @entity25 earlier in the season			0
' one time a @entity40 girl looked at one of the officials and gave the official a 3 - second signal wanting him to call three seconds on her			2
@entity46 stood in the lane as well to have us call three seconds on them , ' the @entity45 reported the referee saying			2
he also noted that @entity40 ' missed 12 - 16 free throws intentionally ' , and @entity46 ' would n't get the ball across the half - court line to get a 10 - second count or to make us call an over and back violation intentionally '			1
the referee had had enough when a @entity46 player was about to deliberately attempt a shot at the wrong basket			1
' that was when i called both coaches together and told them we are not going to make a travesty or mockery of the game			2
' ' we are not going to start trying to shoot and score for the other team			2
' @entity69 who runs @entity70 , a program that girls play basketball at college level , was at the game and filmed some of the ridiculous plays			0
on @entity78 he said : ' this is disgusting and it 's making both schools look bad ...			0
i sure hope both coaches come out in the 2nd half w / a change of heart			0
' the decision by the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) to suspend the teams came after the referee reported the incident			1
the @entity91 schools were subsequently placed on restrictive probation by the high school association for the rest of the academic year and are on probation for the 2015 - 16 year			1
both schools have also been fined $ 1,500			0
@entity69 , who runs a program that helps girls get into college level basketball , was appalled by what he witnessed on the court that night principal @entity102 of @entity46 and principal @entity103 of @entity40 met with @entity86 officials to ask that their teams be allowed to continue to play			1
they instead suggested removing the respective coaches , @entity108 at @entity46 and @entity109 at @entity40 , for the remainder of the season			1
however @entity86 executive director @entity112 stuck by the decision to suspend the teams saying that it was derived from the actions of the players on the court			0
' the student athletes bought into it , ' @entity112 said			0
' they were the ones asking to call three seconds			0
they were the ones stepping back over [ midcourt ]			0
they were the ones not attempting to shoot at the basket			0
' both coaches have been suspended until the end of the 2015 - 2016 school year and neither is allowed to have any role in athletics in @entity91			1
both schools appealed for their teams to be allowed to continue to play , but the local athletic association ruled that the student athletes had bought into the scheme to intentionally lose the game a referee talks to @entity40 coach @entity109 ( left ) and @entity46 coach @entity108 ( right ) during saturday 's game			1
both coaches have been suspended @entity91 director of schools @entity139 said in a statement : ' @entity142 apologizes to the @entity40 and @entity7 basketball players and parents for the lack of leadership exhibited by two of our coaches last saturday evening in the district consolation game			1
' ' players lost opportunities to compete in a regional tournament , lost opportunities for all - tournament status and to showcase their individual talents to collegiate scouts			2
' ' we also apologize to the citizens of @entity91 because of the embarrassment generated locally and nationally for teams motivated to throw a game			2
' the game eventually ended 55 - 29 with @entity46 winning			1
the suspensions meant that @entity166 , who were scheduled to play @entity40 , advanced to the @entity23 semifinals without play			0
@entity169 , scheduled to play @entity46 , also advanced .			0

teams from @entity40 and @entity46 high schools in @entity8 wanted to *bypass* meeting a nationally - ranked rival in the *semi-finals* of a tournament
the game descended into a farce as players missed free throws and incurred penalties in order to lose
one player even tried to deliberately score in her own team 's basket
@entity46 eventually won the game , but a referee reported the incident to the local athletic association and both teams were suspended
both coaches have also been forbidden from taking part in any county athletic program until after the 2015 - 2016 school year
