by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 14 december 2013 snugly wrapped in a stripey towel , the little orphan with heart - melting black eyes wriggles impatiently as he waits for his next feed			1
he does n’t have long to wait , and soon he ’s tucking into his lunch with as much gusto as any hungry infant			2
as any parent knows , baby meal times can be messy and time - consuming affairs			1
so try to imagine what it ’s like being entrusted with the care of 58 noisy			1
these impossibly cute waifs and strays are being cared for by exhausted staff at the @entity20 rescue centre in @entity21 , @entity22 , after an unprecedented number were brought in for emergency care following last week ’s freak storms and tidals surges			1
too young to swim properly or fend for themselves , they were torn from their mothers in the high seas and swept helplessly on to the beaches of @entity33			1
‘ it ’s been absolute chaos , ’ says bleary - eyed @entity21 manager @entity47			1
‘ we have never had this many seals before in one go , and i ’ve been here for two decades			1
‘ there was barely a chance to think			2
it was one arrival after another : bam , bam bam			2
‘ they started coming in on the day after the storm , and by saturday we realised that we were short of pretty much everything we needed to cope			1
i went to the local @entity60 and started throwing supplies into my trolley as if i was on @entity63			2
‘ i worked through my last weekend off and everyone ’s putting in extra hours			2
’ ( if anyone reading this has an industrial liquidiser going spare , by the way , @entity21 is still looking for one			1
their existing model is threatening a nervous breakdown under the stress of catering on such a large scale			0
) for , without the ready supply of their mothers ’ high - calorie milk , if these pups are to have any chance of survival , they need up to five meals a day of a soup made from mashed - up raw fish and an oral rehydration solution			1
@entity86 : a seal being fed and cared for at the @entity20 wildlife hospital in @entity21 , @entity22 but getting nourishment into the unweaned pups is no easy job : they have to be fed with a tube and seals , being torpedo - shaped , are very good at slipping through human hands			1
the process of feeding all the infants takes a laborious two hours — before it starts all over again			0
oh yes , and the staff also have to administer antibiotics , tend wounds , scrub the floors and care for the other creatures — from swans to hedgehogs — that come into the centre			1
no wonder that the devoted wildlife officers , clad in regulation white boiler suits and wellies , seem a little frayed round the edges			0
the 21 core staff have called in favours from retired old hands and there is even an @entity20 chief inspector — @entity116 , usually based in @entity117 — stoically washing feeding tubes at the kitchen sink			1
the nerve centre for the seal rescue is a white - tiled isolation unit with 17 cubicles			1
the unit might be designed to house anything from foxes to otters , but it ’s currently wall - to - wall pups , all of them sharing quarters			1
the usual occupants , among them 140 sickly hedgehogs , have been moved to temporary accommodation in the visitor ’s centre			1
@entity139 puppy irresistible , not only do the big - eyed seal babies look adorable , but the cry of a motherless seal pup is pitiful and disconcertingly human			1
seal of approval : one rather disheveled pup gets to know @entity0 their wailing triggers my maternal instincts , but the impulse to comfort a pup with a cuddle must be resisted			0
i am told i am not allowed to touch them and @entity20 staff try to keep physical contact to an absolute minimum			1
the pups need to be released back into the wild and it is important they do not form attachments to humans			0
whether the humans can resist forming attachments to the pups is another matter			0
@entity47 confesses : ‘ they are gorgeous animals so it ’s easy to get a bit soppy about them , but we remember at all times that they ’re going back to the wild and their own kind			0
‘ the reality is that they are also strong , with very sharp teeth and the older ones can be aggressive when they feel under threat			0
‘ one lady who brought in a pup was bitten very badly on the cheek , simply because the animal was terrified and was defending itself			0
but the bottom line is that if we did n’t take them in , they would starve			0
some pups have arrived in a terrible state , seriously underweight and having been mauled by dogs and other adult seals on beaches			1
it ’s heartbreaking to see them like that			0
’ hanging about : a group of seals lay on the floor of the @entity20 wildlife hospital , waiting for their next feed as hard as it is to resist picking them up , the advice to members of the public who find an abandoned seal is clear : leave them alone and call the @entity20			1
each of the seals is given a name : not for ‘ cutesy ’ reasons , @entity47 insists , but to help identify and track them , and a system has been devised for keeping a record of each season ’s arrivals			2
every year , they are tagged and named according to a theme			0
in 2013 , that theme has been ‘ breakfasts			0
’ i spot @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 among the names written on marker boards pinned beside one of the cubicles , along with the patients ’ medical notes			0
while their beseeching black eyes and winsome expressions would melt even @entity231 ’s heart , there is a downside to housing these little orphans — the pong			0
advice : staff say the best thing for members of the public to do if they discover a pup is to call the @entity20 as i enter a room containing 60 of them , i am almost knocked over by the stench of what seems like raw herring combined with a powerful undertow of wet dog and public convenience			1
the majority of the pups at the wildlife hospital are believed to have come from a 440 - strong breeding colony at @entity252 near @entity253 , further east on the @entity254			2
the storms resulted in one of the highest tides on record for this stretch of coast , and struck at the worst possible time for grey seals , bang in the middle of the pupping season			2
what should happen is that a grey seal pup stays on land for their first three to four weeks , protected by his or her mother and gorging on her nutrient - rich milk			2
pups increase in weight from 13kg to around 45kg during this time , building up valuable fat reserves			0
or to use an analogy , they grow from cocker spaniels into alsatians			0
out and about : @entity0 stands next to a swimming pool - home to numerous rescued pups the juveniles are protected from the cold by their characteristic thick , white coats , which offer high insulation but little water resistance			1
at a month old , the babies are weaned and a sleeker coat replaces their baby fluff , but if they are swept off the beaches before this time it can be catastrophic			1
their white coats , which are designed for insulation , become waterlogged and many drown			0
those who find land are often injured and always hungry			0
and survival is not guaranteed , even among the lucky ones who are rescued			0
the phenomenal rate of weight gain achieved in the wild is simply impossible to replicate with handrearing			0
the solution is to keep the pups for up to five months before they are fit enough to return to the sea			2
now that @entity21 , the biggest centre in the country , is at full stretch , other @entity20 sites are having to take some of the strain			1
i watch as @entity310 , a 19kg pup , is wrapped in a mesh stretcher in preparation for the long journey to a centre in @entity315 , @entity316			2
apparently , seals are quite happy lolling in the back of a van for the duration of a road trip and generally go to sleep , lulled by the vibrations of the vehicle			2
the driver , however , is advised not to stop at any service stations			0
these pups can be as naughty as any human toddler			0
a baby seal , even an underweight and sickly patient , is surprisingly fast and powerful			0
adorable : the @entity20 has now launched a crisis appeal to support the pups ' rehabilitation at one point during my visit , @entity47 has to break from sorting out medicines to stop one of her charges from escaping through a momentarily unguarded door and trying to take a swim in a trough of disinfectant used to clean staff wellies			1
the pups are kept in the isolation unit until they are six weeks old , when they move to shallow indoor bathing pools until they are adult enough to go in larger pools outside			0
once they are old enough , they will be taken on stretchers and released into the water at @entity354 near @entity355 , enabling them to swim into @entity357 , and out to sea on the outgoing tide			0
but first there are thousands of meals to prepare and dish up			2
not surprisingly , with each seal costing £ 22 a week to feed — and expected to stay at @entity21 for five months — the @entity20 has launched a crisis appeal to support their rehabilitation			1
they hope people will give enthusiastically to help save these charismatic creatures			0
as @entity47 says : ‘ @entity368 has n’t been too kind to these seals so far , but hopefully the public ’s generosity will bring them a little bit of festive cheer			2
’ to make a donation towards the pups ’ upkeep , text the @entity20 on 70070 with a message saying @entity379 followed by the amount donated ( e.g. @entity379 £ 3 )			1
the call will cost the chosen amount plus the standard network rate message .			0
