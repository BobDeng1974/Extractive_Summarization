top security experts have warned travelers that a terrorist attack at the @entity3 is ' very likely '			1
the secretary of defense @entity4 said that the @entity6 has deployed two @entity6 warships to stand guard in the @entity9 during the @entity10 , which start next weekend , in case they are needed to help evacuate @entity6			1
the threat of a terrorist attack is being viewed as a very real possibility as @entity17 security forces are hunting a woman suspected of planning a suicide bombing - and she is thought to be in @entity20 already			1
high alert : @entity17 cossacks stand guard near the @entity24 in @entity25 near @entity20			2
@entity27 intelligence chiefs say the 37,000 extra soldiers and police that have been drafted in to boost security have formed a ' ring of steel ' around the event ' soft targets ' : while extra guards in the @entity38 village will make it difficult for terrorists to enter , the more open public locations like the @entity35 ( pictured ) will be more difficult to control still , it is far from clear that @entity17 would allow @entity6 military assets into its territory following a security incident , and @entity45 has made no request for @entity6 security assistance so far			1
the focus of the @entity3 and @entity10 will inevitably be on the 230 athletes who will be competing , but they represent just a fraction of the @entity6 who will be in @entity17			1
there are expected to be 270 coaches and support staff who will accompany the athletes , and a far bigger number of fans in the crowds			0
up to 10,000 spectators are expected to fill the bleachers , putting the best estimate for @entity6 in @entity20 somewhere around 10,600			2
asked about the matter at a @entity65 news conference , @entity62 said only that proper arrangements would be in place , without saying specifically who might do the evacuating			0
' if we need to extract our citizens , we will have appropriate arrangements with the @entity17 to do this , ' @entity62 said on friday			2
the @entity74 also issued a travel alert for @entity6 planning on attending the @entity10 , but it extends throughout the @entity17 and not simply to @entity20			1
' large - scale public events such as the @entity38 present an attractive target for terrorists , and the @entity6 government continues to monitor reported threats of potential terrorist attacks in @entity20 or in @entity17 in general , ' the alert reads			1
@entity6 who decide to travel to @entity17 between the start of the @entity10 between february 7 and march 16 ' should remain attentive regarding their personal security at all times '			1
wanted : @entity86 , whose husband was an @entity88 militant killed by @entity17 security forces last year , is one of the ' black widow ' terrorists who may be in @entity20 plotting an attack @entity27 intelligence have said that some reassurance can come from the reports that an extra 37,000 soldiers and police officers that have been called in to @entity20 in order to boost security have formed a ' ring of steel ' around the event , making it a much harder target			1
many @entity6 commentators - from former @entity107 deputy director @entity106 to former @entity109 presidential candidate @entity108 - have expressed caution but said that they would still go and bring their families			2
mr @entity106 , the former @entity107 deputy director , agreed and urged @entity6 to take care - particularly when they leave the @entity38 village			2
' i think the venue itself is fairly safe			0
i 'd worry about airports elsewhere in @entity17 , i 'd worry about @entity120 hotels elsewhere in @entity17 , ' he said on @entity121			2
back up plan : secretary of defense @entity4 said friday that the @entity6 will have a contingency plan to get the @entity6 out should an attack occur @entity17 president @entity126 , seen in this file photo , told @entity128 that @entity17 will do ' whatever it takes ' to make the @entity3 secure			1
an expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard ' i think these are the most dangerous olympics that i 've experienced in my adult life ... because you have a capable , dedicated , determined terrorist group that has been around for a long time that recently conducted two attacks in @entity17 that say that they want to attack during the @entity10			1
i would take my family			0
i would be very careful			0
i would be very aware of my surroundings			0
' mr @entity108 , who organized the @entity3 in @entity141 in 2002 , told @entity142 last week that the fact that the @entity17 organizers have released the names and photos of suspected terrorists who may be plotting an attack shows that they have an ' extraordinary intelligence ' program			1
‘ there 's never been a games that i know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you 're seeing at @entity20			0
at the same time , the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level , ’ mr @entity108 said			0
‘ i believe the @entity10 will be safe			0
that does n’t mean there ’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today			0
but this is , after all , a dangerous corner of the world			0
a twin bomb attack on the city of @entity167 in december killed 34 people before a militant @entity88 group - based in @entity171 - claimed responsibility			0
@entity172 : a twin bomb attack on the city of @entity167 in december killed 34 people before a militant @entity88 group , based in @entity171 , claimed responsibility			0
