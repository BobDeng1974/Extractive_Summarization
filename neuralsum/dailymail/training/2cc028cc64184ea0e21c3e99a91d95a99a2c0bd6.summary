one of @entity1 ’s canal ways has received a @entity3 makeover with the opening of the @entity6 footbridge			0
spanning the capital ’s @entity8 , the structure looks like a conventional bridge six days of the week			1
but come noon on friday , and it transforms into an incredible fan as it lifts up to let passing boats through the canal			1
the bridge spans the 65ft ( 20 metre ) width of the @entity23 in @entity1 ’s @entity8 , close to @entity25 's @entity24 that curls into a ball			1
@entity28 - based design group @entity27 and structural engineers akt i won a competition to design a kinetic sculpture and have created the ‘ @entity34 ’ as result			0
the bridge ’s five beams , which range from six to seven tonnes , rise to different angles creating a fan effect and are balanced by a 40 tonne counterweight which keeps the beams stable			2
@entity28 - based design group @entity27 and structural engineers akt i won a competition to design a kinetic sculpture and have created the ‘ @entity34 ’ as result ‘ shaped counterweights assist the hydraulic mechanism and reduce the energy required to move the structure , ’ said a spokesperson from @entity27			1
‘ the bridge balustrades are formed from twin rows of inclined stainless steel rods , overlapping to form a robust yet filigree and highly transparent structure			2
’ the @entity24 unfolds across @entity23 every friday at noon the fan bridge spans the 65ft ( 20 metre ) width of the @entity23 in @entity1 ’s @entity8 , close to @entity25 's @entity24 that curls into a ball			1
the @entity24 unfolds across @entity23 every friday at noon			2
a conventional opening bridge mechanism relies on a single rigid element and lifts up to let boats pass			1
but the rolling bridge folds up out of the way of oncoming traffic by curling up into an octagon			0
the design feat , which is the brainchild of @entity66 designer @entity25 , was built in 2004 as part of the newly developed @entity8			0
the bridge consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and is connected above by two part links that collapse towards the deck under the control of pistons			0
‘ the most challenging part of the fabrication was the required accuracy			0
for safety reasons , gaps between the beams had to be no bigger than 3mm over a length of 20 metres ’ , project architect , @entity74 told @entity75			0
‘ as impressive was the fabrication accuracy of the conical counterweights , which sink into the engine room turning into a set of walkable steps flush with the granite slabs around them			0
’ the bridge will let boats past and , when it is fully closed , pedestrians can walk along the 9.8ft ( 3 metre ) wide new design , which is illuminated by led lights			2

the design uses five steel beams which move using hydraulic jacks
