a woman who was left humiliated after discovering she was too fat to fit into her wedding dress is now half the woman she was - after losing eight stone			1
having found the dress of her dreams , @entity6 , 28 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , was looking forward to marrying her sweetheart , @entity10 but just a week before the wedding , she discovered she had gained so much weight , she struggled to fit into her dress - and was left mortified			1
' there were about six to eight weeks between all of the fittings and up until that point it had fitted			0
' yet on that final fitting the zip just would n't go any higher			0
' @entity25 and ' fat and frumpy ' @entity6 celebrate their wedding day the dress was hastily let out by one inch on each side to ensure mrs @entity6 could marry in comfort			1
' i had to have it taken out an inch either side , so two inches in total , ' said the mother - of - two			1
' the dress was already a size 20 , which annoyed me anyway since i did n't believe that i was that size at all , so when they had to let it out , it was absolutely horrifying			1
' as a result , mrs @entity6 said that while most brides feel on top of the world , she walked down the aisle feeling ' fat and frumpy '			1
resolving to ditch her favourite takeaway foods , chocolate and kebabs which had helped her creep up to 16st , she pledged to lose the weight for good			1
' as i got comfortable in the relationship i stopped worrying about my weight and before long the pounds piled on , ' she said ' i knew i had to do something after my wedding dress needed to be let out , but i could n't face another crash diet that only worked for a week and left me feeling hungry			1
' mrs @entity6 then began her battle to beat the bulge with the help of @entity62			1
she had originally piled on the pounds by eating five takeaways a week and drinking up to five cans of cola a day			2
' the problem was that we did n't really cook at home			0
it just got to the point where we would rely on frozen meals and takeaways , ' she said			2
' we 'd probably have five takeaways a week			2
my favourite food was doner kebabs			2
i 'd have one a week			0
' i also lived on cola , i 'd have four or five cans of it a day			0
i just did n't realise how bad for you it was			0
' after joining her local @entity81 , she learned how to cook healthy , fat - free meals			2
she has cut out the takeaways and the family now enjoys healthy home - cooked meals using fresh ingredients every night			1
now the super-slimmer is a trim 8st having shed exactly half of her previous body weight in just 12 months			1
the mother - of - two is now a slimline size 10 and , right , is seen trying on her old size 20 jeans the couple beam as they raise a toast at their wedding - but @entity6 said she felt ' fat and frumpy ' on her big day ' it is fair to say two of me could fit into that dress now , ' said a delighted mrs @entity6 , who lives with @entity25 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
' when i look at my wedding pictures now it feels very odd			0
i do n't remember being like that			0
' i am a completely different person now			0
i have changed so much and feel a lot more confident			0
it has been quite easy to keep the weight off			2
i have changed my lifestyle completely ' as my full time job is working as a @entity62 consultant , i would have felt a bit of a fraud not keeping it off ! ' since losing the weight , mrs @entity6 says she has now got more energy to run around after her two children , six - year - old @entity118 and @entity119 , three			1
' it has improved my family life immeasurably - especially with the kids , ' she said			0
' we have just got a puppy called @entity125 , who we take out walking , and i 'm able to do so much more with the kids			0
' ' i look forward to summer now and wearing size 10 clothes , ' she added			0
' i never thought i would even enter a gym , let alone enjoy personal training sessions			0

@entity6 felt *ashamed* after her size 20 dress had to be made bigger
the 28 - year - old said she felt frumpy as she walked down the aisle
*binging* on takeaways and chocolate saw weight creep up to 16st
has now ditched her doner kebab habit and has shed an *impressive* 8st
