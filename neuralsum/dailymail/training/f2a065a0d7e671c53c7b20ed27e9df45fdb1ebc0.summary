by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 19 november 2012 @entity2 : 20:54 est , 19 november 2012 rodents : mutant ' super rats ' are plaguing the upmarket town of @entity6 - on - @entity7 with its pretty riverside location and the annual @entity10 , @entity6 - on - @entity7 has never had much trouble attracting visitors			1
but the latest ones wo n’t be welcome – the upmarket town in @entity15 has been invaded by a plague of mutant ‘ super-rats ’			0
carrying a poison - resistant gene , they have been found by researchers on farms and other properties around @entity6 after previously being identified in parts of @entity24 and @entity25			1
the brown rats look the same as their non-mutant counterparts and , like them , can carry life - threatening diseases , but are resistant to typical pest controls thanks to genetic mutation			1
dr @entity33 , a research fellow at the @entity34 who carried out the study that found the rats in @entity6 , said : ‘ rats carry a vast range of diseases , including @entity41 ’s disease			1
‘ these diseases are very harmful and potentially fatal to both humans and animals			2
’ @entity41 ’s disease is a water - borne bacterial infection linked to the urine of infected rats			2
it killed @entity49 rowing champion @entity48 in 2010			0
dr @entity33 used new dna techniques to determine the prevalence of rats with the poison - resistant gene			2
as well as areas around @entity6 , they were found in @entity24 near @entity56 and @entity57			1
‘ for 30 years we have been using the same two poisons , ’ dr @entity33 said			2
‘ this has meant that the susceptible rats died and the resistant ones lived and bred			2
‘ we are now in a situation where the rat poison which pest controllers are legally allowed to use is ineffective , meaning it is becoming harder to control rats			1
’ @entity6 - on - @entity7 , pictured , which hosts the world famous annual @entity10 , is the latest place to become host to the creatures after they were found in @entity24 and @entity25 the @entity74 is evaluating whether new poisons should be approved to control rats			1
however , many animal welfare groups believe that this is not the answer as poisons , or rodenticides , can be detrimental to wildlife			0
@entity82 , of the @entity83 , said : ‘ the risk to wildlife by the use of rodenticides is very real , particularly to animals which eat rats such as birds of prey and barn owls			0
‘ rat control is necessary but the @entity83 does not believe that the answer is the licensing of more and more toxic poisons			1
‘ the more poisons we use , the more resistant rats will become to them			1
the answer is firstly prevention and then other control methods such as trapping and shooting			0
’ but @entity101 , a technical manager with the @entity102 , said : ‘ tons and tons of poison are being used to little effect			0
‘ in terms of the threat to wildlife , it would be a lot better if new poisons which actually work could be used as a much smaller amount of them would be needed			0
‘ rats are very intelligent and would soon become behaviourally resistant to traps			0
’ dr @entity33 , whose survey was funded by nine organisations involved in pest control , said : ‘ my view is that we need to use the stronger poisons but we need to tell people how to use them carefully			1
if we can do that we can solve the problem			0
’ there are thought to be 10.5million rats in the country			0
in areas where resistance exists around 70 per cent carry the rodenticide - resistant gene .			0

rats carrying diseases have *spread* from @entity24 and @entity25
stronger poisons that would control ' super rats ' are currently illegal
