projecting unity on @entity4 , president @entity0 and @entity2 chancellor @entity1 put their differences over the @entity8 's spying program aside on friday and threatened tougher and broader new sanctions against @entity10 if it does n't quickly change its disruptive behavior in @entity13			1
' we will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more - severe sanctions ' if @entity4 disrupts a presidential election in @entity13 scheduled for may 25 , @entity0 said at a news conference with @entity1 outside the @entity19 early friday afternoon			1
' further sanctions will be unavoidable , ' @entity1 agreed			0
in october , @entity0 promised that the @entity8 was no longer hacking her personal calls			2
that courtesy does not apply to other residents of @entity2 , including other @entity2 officials , however			0
the issue has aggravated @entity2 citizens , prompting calls for @entity44 to strike some type of agreement with @entity47 to limit @entity8 surveillance on @entity2 soil			1
@entity2 had hoped to get the @entity8 to enter into a no - spy agreement with the country before today 's meeting , but talks fell apart , the @entity50 reports			1
' what the @entity2 want , and wanted , is that we would never do anything against their laws on their territory , ' a senior administration official told the @entity50			0
that 's an agreement the @entity8 ' has with no country			2
' ' there ’s no country where we have a no - spy agreement , ' president @entity0 said in february at a press conference with @entity70 president @entity69 when the subject of spying on that country 's citizens came up			1
president @entity0 said on friday it was n't accurate to say that the @entity8 had proposed and then withdrawn a no - spy agreement			1
instead , he said the government has proposed the same guidelines with @entity2 that it maintains with other allies including the @entity79			0
he did not describe them in any detail			0
at a press conference the two leaders made it clear they have differences when it comes to @entity8 surveillance overseas			1
' there are still some gaps that need to be worked through , ' president @entity0 said			1
@entity1 was diplomatic , as well , but a shade more blunt : ' we have differences of opinion to overcome			1
' a @entity2 parliamentary panel probing the @entity34 issue is eager to invite former @entity34 contractor @entity33 to speak to the panel			1
the @entity2 government has made clear it opposes the idea of letting @entity33 , whose @entity8 passport has been revoked , testify in @entity44 , drawing criticism from @entity33 's opponents			1
this was the first time the two world leaders had met since the @entity33 document leak that revealed the the @entity34 had been listening to @entity1 's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade the two leaders met as the @entity108 announced it would hold talks with @entity13 and @entity4 later this month on the price of natural gas , an attempt to avoid any disruption in supplies			1
@entity10 recently hiked the price of gas shipped to @entity13 to $ 485 per thousand cubic meters from $ 268.50 , and threatened to limit deliveries if @entity119 does not meet the new price and repay a debt of $ 3.5 billion			0
more forebodingly , @entity123 forces shot down two @entity13 helicopters friday and @entity13 reported many rebels dead and wounded as the interim government in @entity119 launched its first major offensive against an insurgency that has seized government buildings across the east			0
the diplomatic deal struck two weeks ago in @entity132 has failed to de-escalate the conflict between @entity135 separatists in eastern @entity13 and the central government in @entity119			0
the @entity8 and @entity137 have sharply rebuked @entity138 for flouting his responsibilities under the deal , and @entity10 on friday declared all hopes for implementing the accord ' effectively destroyed ' after @entity119 's offensive against the insurgents			2
@entity0 said @entity138 is free to offer his own views with regard to events in @entity13 , but it is n't acceptable for the @entity149 to think ' it has veto power ' over decisions made by a duly elected government in @entity119			2
in their remarks , @entity0 and @entity1 both said they would prefer the situation in @entity13 to be settled through diplomacy , but both leaders made it clear that the next step would be to order sanctions on separate parts of the @entity4 economy or military — on energy or arms for example — if @entity4 continued to ignore the agreement it made earlier this month with the @entity8 and @entity108			1
neither leader specified precisely what was being considered			0
as the crisis in @entity13 has worsened , @entity1 has spoken to @entity138 perhaps more frequently than has any other @entity137 leader			0
because of this , the @entity8 sees her as a critical channel of communication , as well as a key player in the effort to prevent other @entity108 nations from going soft on sanctions			0
' there 's no question that the situation in @entity13 , the continued failure by @entity4 to abide by its commitments in the @entity186 will be a focus of the conversation , ' @entity19 spokesman @entity180 said before the two leaders met			0
@entity8 and @entity2 officials said ahead of the @entity0 - @entity1 meeting that part of the discussion probably would focus on how the @entity8 and @entity137 would coordinate harsher punishments — including sanctions targeting broad sectors of @entity4 's economy — should @entity10 further provoke tensions in @entity13 , such as by sending military forces into restive eastern @entity13			1
the @entity19 is concerned that @entity137 's deep economic interests in @entity4 and dependence on @entity4 energy could deter @entity108 nations from following through with sanctions that could ricochet onto their own economies			0
' she 's getting enormous pressure from @entity2 industry not to harm their interests , ' said @entity210 , a @entity137 expert at the @entity211			0
" she has to start laying the political groundwork for this because it requires some sacrifice			0
" @entity1 , like @entity0 , has ruled out military action to deter @entity138 from seizing more of @entity13			2
sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , who has urged @entity0 to send weapons to @entity13 's government , said he planned to tell @entity1 during a private meeting that he was embarrassed but unsurprised by her country 's failure of leadership			2
' the leaders , they 're being governed by the industrial complex of @entity2 , ' @entity216 said thursday			0
' they might as well have them in the government			0
' a troubled @entity108 - @entity8 trade agreement , known as the @entity232 , was also on the agenda , as well as joint efforts to deal with climate change , @entity237 's civil war and nuclear negotiations with @entity239 , said @entity240 of the @entity19 's @entity241			2
@entity1 will also speak to the @entity8 @entity242 on friday , focusing on the fledgling trade agreement and @entity8 - @entity137 economic ties			2
president @entity0 says the @entity8 government has proposed the same spying guidelines to @entity2 that it maintains with other allies including the @entity79			1
he did not describe them in any detail ' there are still some gaps that need to be worked through , ' president @entity0 said on friday of the @entity8 and @entity2 's positions on the @entity8 's spying program			1

president @entity0 and @entity2 chancellor @entity1 met today for the first time since documents leaked by @entity33 revealed the @entity34 was *tapping* @entity1 's personal cell phone
@entity2 had hoped it would get the @entity8 to enter into a no - spy agreement before today 's meeting , but no such deal was made
at a press conference the two leaders made it clear they have differences when it comes to @entity8 surveillance overseas
' there are still some gaps that need to be worked through , ' president @entity0 said
@entity1 was more blunt : ' we have differences of opinion to overcome '
