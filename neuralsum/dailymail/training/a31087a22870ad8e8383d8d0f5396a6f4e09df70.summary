sickened : @entity2 and her husband @entity9 have had £ 900 stolen from their joint account by hackers murdered : @entity2 's son @entity2 was killed by @entity2 and @entity24 in 1993 the 42 - year - old said : ' this has been really sickening for both of us			1
that money was our @entity4 box			2
' it 's an awful feeling , looking at an empty bank account and wondering how it happened , what it means , and wondering how you are going to have any @entity4			0
' you feel powerless and violated , knowing that someone has been into your bank account and cleared it out			2
' electrician mr @entity39 said he knew about £ 900 was missing when he looked at his @entity42 account and it was showing the money had been transferred to @entity14			1
speaking at their home in @entity47 , mr @entity39 , 36 , said : ' i told @entity42 that my bank account had been hacked , but they said there was nothing they could do			0
it was up to @entity14			1
' i phoned @entity14 and they logged my call but said they could not suspend the transfer because they had not proof it was fraudulent			1
' they say i have to make a complaint and it will take between seven to ten days to resolve the matter			0
' i am hoping that because i have spotted it quickly and reported it that they will be able to return the money to us without delay - it 's savings we had put to one side for the children 's @entity4 presents			2
' what seems crazy is that the the bank ca n't stop the payment on my behalf because the money has not yet gone through the clearing system			0
' i went to my local branch of @entity42 as soon as it opened to report it and they said it was showing as being still in process			0
horror : a security camera sees two - year - old @entity83 being abducted from the @entity85 shopping centre in @entity86 @entity87 : schoolboys @entity2 , left , and @entity24 , right , murdered @entity2 when they abducted him from a shopping centre aged two ' i have not used @entity14 this year			1

she added : ' i would warn everyone to look at their @entity94 account and make sure an email address connected with their @entity14 is not public for all to see			1
' it 's awful to think that simply by getting hold of an email address some evil racketeer can clear you out at the touch of a button			0
' we have reported it to the police and they have given us a crime number , but they say it is up to @entity14 and the bank to try to sort it out in the first place			2
' i 'm just hoping and praying that the bank and @entity14 can get the money back to us			1
without it , we are looking at a really grim @entity4			0
