it 's the ultimate treat for @entity2 fans and stands an imposing 6ft tall - just like the man himself			1
but shoppers at @entity8 's @entity7 shopping centre looked more than a little surprised to discover a chocolate sculpture of @entity2 in their midst			1
one lady was spotted cautiously approaching the edible artwork before quickly backing off , while another could n't quite hide their smile of surprise			0
it did , however , prove an immediate hit with a pair of police sniffer dogs who wagged their tails as they gave it a thorough sniffing down			1
the artwork , which has been given pride of place in the shopping mall 's atrium , was commissioned by @entity44 to mark celebrate its screening of the third series of @entity47			0
it took a crew of eight people to complete the sculpture , which took over 250 man hours to create and weighs 40kg does it look like me ? @entity2 strikes a pose with @entity56 during an @entity58 party mixed reaction : a pair of police sniffer dogs loved the sculpture but shoppers looked baffled hilarious : a lady bursts into laughter after spotting the 6ft homage to mr @entity2 not amused : a shopper looks thoroughly unimpressed as she contemplates the artwork luckily for @entity2 , who usually enjoys a considerably more complimentary response to projects he 's involved in , the piece will only be in residence temporarily			1

the confection , which was baked ahead of the release of @entity105 in november , met with the approval of @entity107 herself , who , when asked about it , said ms @entity98 was ' incredibly talented '			0
other a-listers to get the culinary treatment include @entity112 , whose likeness was made from bacon , and @entity115 who featured on a cake			2
