by @entity0 tackling ' accentism ' - discriminaton against people with regional accents - is as important as the fight against racism , ageism and sexism , it has been claimed			1
prejudice against certain accents is the ' last taboo ' , according to @entity12 linguist dr @entity11 , who says people are made to feel ' fake ' when they have to ' posh up ' while talking			1
dr @entity11 is calling on employers to promise that job applicants ' accents will not be used against them in the same way as gender , sexual orientation , religion , age and race are ignored			2
he said : ' we should acknowledge that any form of workplace discrimination , to include accentism , should not be tolerated in a society which seeks to be more inclusive			2
' this is why " accentism " should be taken seriously as a problem which affects many of us			1
' clearly , most people modify their accent not because they lack pride in it , quite the opposite in fact			0
' it 's actually because they fear the negative perceptions others might have of them if they do n't			0
' dr @entity11 , who is from originally from @entity42 , added : ' @entity43 's said ; " it is impossible for an @entity45 to open his mouth without making some other @entity45 hate or despise him			0
" ' i do n't know if one prejudice is better then the other , you 're the wrong colour , the wrong sex , wrong age , wrong accent			0
' his call to battle accentism comes after his research showed many people feel they have to change the way they speak to fit in			1
though accent modification is common , dr @entity11 said it can threaten the way we feel about personal identity , often causing anger and frustration			0
meetings at work with ' posh ' sounding senior managers , he says , can be especially stressful for an individual with a more pronounced regional accent along with job interviews and even speaking on the phone , he said			2
research shows people with strong accents feel they 've ' sold out ' if they change the way they speak at work dr @entity11 's research is based on an ongoing survey of children , students and staff from different institutions and schools			1
it reveals that while most people accept the practice and accent modification , a third of respondents say they feel like a fraud when they consciously change the way they speak			1
though accent modification and the relationship between accent and identity are well researched , it is the first time anyone has attempted to investigate how accent modification in @entity102 affects the way we feel about ourselves			2
@entity43 's claim that ' it is impossible for an @entity45 to open his mouth without making some other @entity45 hate or despise him , ' is still true , according to one academic dr @entity11 added : ' many brits consciously modify their accent in social situations as a means to create a better impression			0
' while this is a common practice , we should not assume that it is accepted by all speakers without issue			0
' as part of my ongoing research , many participants see accent modification as synonymous with selling out and a clear threat to their sense of self			0
' this is especially true in education , where teachers in particular may feel pressure to modify their regional accent in order to be perceived in a more positive light by students and fellow staff alike			1
' my point is perfectly illustrated by an @entity139 inspector who last year told a @entity141 teacher working in a @entity143 school to sound " more southern "			0
' examples revealed by dr @entity11 's research include a teacher from @entity147 , @entity148 , who ' felt disgusted ' with himself for modifying his accent at a job interview , a @entity153 woman who felt ' fake , angry and upset ' for modifying her accent with her lecturers , and believes she is ' betraying ' who she really is , and a @entity157 who stated that accent modification , mostly practised in business contexts , leaves him feeling ' whipped ' .			1
