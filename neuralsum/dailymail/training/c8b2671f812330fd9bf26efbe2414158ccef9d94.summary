when @entity3 ’s world came crashing down in may , her wedding plans suddenly and very publicly cancelled , she knew who she could turn to			2
beyond her immediate family , one of the first people she called was @entity8 , asking if she fancied to spend some party time together on @entity11 ’s @entity10 to help try and regroup after the shock			1
@entity8 , who was also going through a turbulent time with her coach / boyfriend @entity14 , agreed and the pair seemed to be content to be photographed hanging out together			2
friendship : @entity8 was there for @entity3 after her split from @entity19 shelved : while close off the court , all bets will be off when @entity3 and @entity8 meet in the @entity23 final barely three months after offering mutual support they will on sunday night contest the final of the @entity23 , with both pledging their friendship will be set aside as @entity3 goes for her first @entity30 title and @entity8 her 18th			1
the appearance in the final of the two means that eight different women have featured in the climaxes to the @entity36 events in 2014			2
@entity37 , godmother of professional women ’s tennis , sees this as a sign of the game ’s health but is clear that she thinks @entity8 is about to end her barren spell in the @entity46 this season			1
not only that , she also believes that , even approaching 33 , the world @entity51 will one day pass @entity53 ’s mark of 22 @entity36 titles — she stands now on 17 and would equal @entity56 and @entity57 with victory			1
‘ @entity8 is the one to beat , she should win if she plays well			2
the main difference is her serve , although @entity3 is doing a better job on her serve than she was , actually the biggest weakness in women ’s tennis right now is the serve , ' @entity37 says			1
good humour : @entity3 impersonates @entity8 at a charity match and the pair on holiday in @entity11 ‘ i think @entity8 will end up with many more than 18 — and 22 , i can imagine her doing that			1
it ’s up to her , whether she is willing to pay the price			0
i played until i was 40			0
she is a phenomenal athlete and gets a lot of free points on her serve			0
’ frankly it will not say much for the depth in women ’s tennis if @entity8 does get to 23 sometime in her mid-thirties			1
like everyone , @entity37 , a remarkably strong character herself , much admires the way @entity3 has bounced back from personal trauma this summer			1
‘ i think it ’s very character revealing after the break up with @entity19 what she has done			2
taking up the [ @entity88 ] marathon as well and doing it for charity			0
it shows how strong she really is			0
going for it : @entity8 is playing for her 18th @entity30 title on sunday unfinished business : although @entity3 's been no 1 in the world , she 's yet to win a major title ‘ they have both done well in their careers but i think @entity3 is one of the greatest of people , she is very respectful and i take my hat off to her how she has handled everything			1
‘ in the final she has to go to the net when she can			0
she ’s very good at defence so she has to maintain that and her serve has to hold up			0
’ it is the most fascinating backdrop to a women ’s final in years , with one great champion trying to salvage what has been a difficult and deflating season , featuring dramas such as her dazed behaviour at @entity113			1
the challenger is being driven by something more than the desire to win , perhaps as @entity19 was when he went on his tear through the @entity118			0
@entity119 do not always get much support when tackling an @entity121 at @entity122 , but even the most stone hearted @entity88 would struggle not to be somewhat torn about this			0
@entity37 will join sir @entity125 to stage @entity126 on finals day of the @entity129 tournament at the @entity130 on 7th december			2
the event , which will benefit the @entity132 , will feature @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
for tickets visit @entity137 or call 0207 070 4404			0

@entity8 and @entity3 meet in the @entity23 final
the duo are close friends and bonded after *recently* off - court dramas
soon after @entity3 split with @entity19 , the women 's tennis *powerhouses* *enjoyed* a holiday in @entity11
on sunday , @entity8 is playing for her 18th @entity30 title
@entity152 would claim her first slam is she is *victorious*
eight different women have appeared in slam finals this season
@entity37 believes @entity8 can match @entity53 's 22 majors
if @entity8 wins on sunday she *'ll* match @entity56 and @entity57
