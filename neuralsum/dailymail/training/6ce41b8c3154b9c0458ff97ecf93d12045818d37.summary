by @entity0 it 's one of the most unique and deeply personal experiences you 'll ever have ; a private moment where time and vanity disappear in a haze of pain and euphoria			2
for those reasons perhaps , few of us would be willing to share it with the world			2
but @entity15 , a 35 - year - old former nursery nurse and mother - of - one , feels completely different			1
for ms @entity15 is one of the stars of cult @entity19 series @entity21 and says that giving birth in front of the tv cameras was one of the proudest moments of her life			1
thrilled : new mother @entity15 with her daughter @entity28 and her partner , @entity30 although the presence of the cameras would suggest the opposite , @entity15 is no exhibitionist desperate for her 15 minutes of fame			1
instead , her appearance on the show was the culmination of a seven - year battle against infertility and her daughter , 6lb 12oz @entity28 , the much - longed for result			1
' my partner and i started talking about [ going on the show ] and we decided we should have her birth filmed , ' explains @entity15			1
' we thought , " she 's probably going to be the only baby we ever have , so would n't it be nice ? " ' filming itself proved easy and @entity15 says the experience of working with documentary makers was ' fantastic '			1
euphoric : @entity15 with baby @entity28 and @entity30 moments after her birth - and still being filmed nearly there : @entity15 says she enjoyed a wonderful pregnancy until being diagnosed with diabetes ' we got a continuity of care with the producers , ' she explains			1
' every time i went for a scan or a consultation , they were there			2
' we built a friendship up with them , so when we were doing the interviews , it did n't feel like a film crew			1
even though there was a massive camera in my face , it felt like we were doing it with friends			2
' @entity15 's road to motherhood began seven years ago , when , at the age of 28 , she and her partner @entity78 decided to start trying for a baby			1
after two fruitless years of trying , the couple visited the doctor to find out what had gone wrong			2
' @entity30 was fine , ' remembers @entity15			1
' it [ infertility ] was down to me			2
' discovering that she had endometriosis , a condition that results in womb tissue growing in other parts of the body , was a devastating blow			2
' i did n't know too much about it to begin with , ' she explains			2
' i 'd always had heavy and painful periods but i thought it was just one of those things			2
' i suppose my heart sort of sank , and then it got worse because i went and googled it and read that people who have it often have polycystic ovaries too			0
' luckily for @entity15 , her worst fears proved unfounded and doctors were able to cut the endometrioisis away before giving her drugs to turbo - charge her ovaries			1
worth it : despite the trials and tribulations , @entity15 says she would do everything again if she had to endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb ( the endometrium ) appears in other parts of the @entity124 they can be found anywhere , most occur on the ovaries , on the lining of the pelvis behind the uterus and the top of the vagina			1
according to the @entity133 , the condition affects around two million women in the @entity135			0
most are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and @entity137 include painful or heavy periods , and pain in the lower stomach , back and pelvis			0
a lack of energy , fertility problems and depression are often linked to it			1
source : @entity148 ' they put me on clomid but that did n't work either so eventually , we spoke to a consultant who put us on a @entity157 [ intrauterine insemination ] treatment			0
that was very invasive ; i had injections through the stomach every day and there were a lot of nasal sprays			0
' despite their best efforts , the first round of @entity157 treatment was a failure			0
' it was most gut - wrenching thing i 've ever been through , ' says @entity15			1
' it was soul - destroying and i was n't sure whether to do it again			1
it put a real strain on my relationship too			0
' the couple chose to persevere and on the 16th january 2013 , discovered that she was expecting - ' the best feeling ever ' , says @entity15			1
her elation continued as she enjoyed a ' lovely pregnancy ' with no morning sickness and the unexpected bonus of wonderfully thick glossy hair			0
but despite her joy , the road to motherhood proved bumpy once more and she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes			0
' i knew more about it [ than the endometriosis ] and i was n't too worried to begin with but as the weeks went on , the tablets i was given stopped providing my body with enough support			0
they put me on insulin and that did frighten me a bit			0
' new series : the new series of @entity21 was filmed at @entity199 in @entity200 best moment : @entity15 with @entity28 in her arms a few moments after giving birth to her by the time she went into labour , @entity15 was a veteran of multiple hospital visits but admits , as a first time mother , to having some qualms about giving birth			1
' my sister and all their friends have had babies and i 've heard all the horror stories but i had extra worries about going into labour because of all the problems , ' she reveals			2
' i did n't want an epidural , ' she adds			0
' i wanted to go au naturel but as you 'll see [ in the show ] that did n't happen			2
' despite being able to hear the cameras whirring behind the walls , @entity15 says her televised birth was a ' fantastic experience ' and hopes baby @entity28 will one day see the tape			1
' it is a really private , intimate moment but watching @entity21 , i 've always thought what a lovely thing it is to share and what a lovely moment it is			1
' going into labour , there 's so much going on that you forget about them			0
they 're tiny so you do forget they 're there			0
' she adds : ' i was n't very worried about being filmed in labour			0
it can be a bit gory but not a lot of people tune in to see the bits			0
' it 's more informative and i cry every time i watch it			0
without these programmes , women who do n't have children do n't get to see or hear about these experiences			0
' i do n't mind that it 's out there			0
it 's a moment that i 'm proud of			0
i 'm proud of what i achieved with her [ @entity28 ] and i want to show her off			1
' i get to keep that moment for the rest of my life			0
' one born every minute , tonight at 9pm on @entity19			0
