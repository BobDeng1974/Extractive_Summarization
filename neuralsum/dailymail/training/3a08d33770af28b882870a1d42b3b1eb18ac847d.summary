’ the document , known as an apostolic exhortation , builds on views the pontiff has aired since his election in march			1
poverty and peace : since his enthronement @entity4 has repeatedly called for ' a poor church ' @entity4 has previously expressed his disdain for @entity13 capitalism , calling for a more ethical banking system and curbs on financial speculation			1
