by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 1 september 2013 from an old - fashioned barbers , quaint bakery and traditional @entity4 pub - the town of @entity6 is the picture of a thriving community			1
but for the recession - hit @entity4 town , the appearance of prosperity comes from a creative scheme that rejuvenates boarded up windows and doors with colourful paintings			1
the @entity17 aims to use graphics and artwork to encourage tourists to visit the town where @entity6 whiskey was distilled for the first time			1
putting on a front : this remarkable painting of a greengrocer with a bounty of produce on show is just one of the scenes that are brightening up @entity6 where past meets present : the old - fashioned shop fronts , such as this barbers look striking in the town , which has been badly hit by the recession sweet touch : a boarded - up window is made to look like the front of a bakery			1
the scheme aims to attract more tourists to @entity6 window shopping : from strange scene like this headless man ( left ) to an image of a traditional @entity4 pub , artists @entity45 and @entity46 have made the town 's main street vibrant and interesting the project has given around a dozen vacant units a facelift			1
broken windows and unused doors have been covered with scenes of buzzing businesses			0
hundreds of thousands of visitors pass through the town of @entity6 to reach one of @entity4 's biggest attractions - the @entity64			2
now , the village is becoming recognisable for highly detailed artwork and graphics that brighten up its main street			0
director of environmental services for the local council , @entity69 said : ' being a tourist village , there was quite a lot of emphasis put on trying to bring about an uplift and see could it be the catalyst for further economic development in the town			0
appealing : two of the shops that were given a full facelift are now no longer occupied , which is testament to the project 's success view from the top deck : when fake shop fronts ca n't be erected , portraits of farmers have been put up to look down on the town location : tourists pass through the village to reach one of @entity4 's biggest attractions - the @entity64 notable : the town , on the @entity4 's @entity64 is home to @entity6 whiskey ' that seems to be the case now , the village has been very popular this year			1
it 's been very successful			0
' two of the shops brightened up with art over the past year are no longer vacant			1
' obviously locals would much rather see the properties filled and in use all the time but this is definitely the next best option , ' @entity69 said			0
artists @entity45 and @entity46 have painted windows and doors on to empty houses , with farmyard animals emerging from the shops			2
spooky : some of the paintings , such as the scary faces in these windows have a gothic look @entity120 , green grass of home : the @entity4 government has spent £ 2million to tackle dereliction over the past two years			2
this artwork is fixed to a hoarding around a building site points of interest : farmyard animals ( left ) are a recurring theme in the town 's paintings			0
some of the windows have been painted with detailed items ( right ) smarten up : the image of sharp suits in this painting reflects the project 's aim to make @entity6 more appealing walk on by : a painted pheasant looks out on @entity143 's busy main street the scheme was set up by locals and supported by the council			2
the local distillery contributed to the fundraising effort			0
£ 30,000 were raised for the first stage of the project and the second phase was carried out using government funds			1
the @entity4 government has spent £ 2 million pounds to tackle dereliction over the past two years and stickers were applied to windows in areas near the luxury golf resort where @entity160 leaders met to give the impression that business was booming			0
sense of humour : from ' a cut above the rest ' to ' @entity170 ' - the artist responsible for the new barber 's shop had fun with the quirky concept juxtaposition : a woman carried polystyrene takeaway containers past a mural of a wholesome farmer 's market thumbs up : these teenagers give the seal of approval to the town 's innovative scheme			0
