a prison sentence at @entity1 not only separated you from the outside world - but all human contact			1
built in 1829 , it was the first jail to implement solitary confinement for every single inmate which is thought to have brought on mental illness			1
even outside the tiny cells , guards would cover their heads with a hood so they remained in confinement even when they wandered through its stone halls			1
the prison , which closed its doors in 1971 , is considered by many people as one of the most haunted buildings in @entity22			2
haunted halls : @entity1 was the first prison in @entity22 to implement solitary confinement and is believed to be one of the most haunted buildings in the country chilling : thousands of hardcore prisoners housed within these tiny cells in the @entity29 would live alone , eat alone and even exercised alone in tiny individual yards chilling : the guards would even cover the inmates ' heads with a hood when they left their cells so they could not see any of the others or map out the prison in their minds cruelty : and they allegedly subjected the prisoners to inhumane torture methods like the ' mad chair ' , where they would cut off prisoners ' circulation - necessitating amputations notorious : the prison even housed feared prohibition - era gangster @entity48 whose luxurious room has been restored for tourists king among prisoners : @entity48 spent most of his one year sentence in relative comfort and was allowed to furnish his cell with antiques , rugs , and oil paintings ghostly sightings : the prison closed down in 1971 and reopened as a museum in 1996 , but tourists still report ghostly sightings strange presence : those who believe in ghost stories say the trouble souls of the mistreated inmates still roam @entity69 's crumbling hallways home : the prison designer 's ambitious mechanical innovations placed each prisoner had his or her own private cell , centrally heated , with running water , a flush toilet , and a skylight its crumbling stone walls , dark corridors and claustrophobia - inducing cells once housed thousands of hardcore criminals			1
the @entity29 prison 's 142 - year history is steeped in controversy and cruelty and those who believe in ghost stories say the troubled souls of inmates still roam the abandoned halls			2
they were severely mistreated by the prison guards who found a number of sick ways to punish those who misbehaved			2
according to @entity98 , they would use a torture method called the ' water bath ' where they would dunk the prisoner in water then hang them to dry in the cold outside until ice formed on the skin			0
they would also tie inmates so tightly in a device called ' the mad chair ' that it would cut off circulation and necessitate amputations			0
and the worst offenders would be put in ' the hole ' , a pitch - black underground cell where they had no light , no human contact and little air			0
the solitary confinement system was eventually discarded when the prison became overcrowded but @entity69 is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants			1
it housed infamous criminals like bank robber @entity127 and even @entity48 who headed a criminal syndicate illegally supplying alcohol during the prohibition in the early - 1900s			0
infamous : housed inside great , stone walls - @entity69 was just as famous for its wagon - wheel design as it was for the cruelty inflicted on prisoners trapped : prisoners at @entity69 were thought to have gone insane having been housed inside tiny cells with little light and air poltergeist : a man who helps maintain the building says he once walked into @entity142 4 and felt an unknown force grab him so tight he could not move eerie atmosphere : @entity69 certainly has the appearance of a haunted building with its rusting walls and claustrophobia - inducing cells which once housed thousands of hardcore criminals blinded : to prevent distraction , knowledge of the building , and even mild interaction with guards , inmates were hooded whenever they were outside their cells torture : one of the punishments the guards used was called the ' water bath ' where they would dunk inmates in water then hang them in the cold outside until ice formed on their skin punishment : and the worst offenders would be put in ' the hole ' , a pitch - black underground cell where they had no light , no human contact and little air cruel therapy : people who ran the prison believed that the criminals - living in total silence and left alone with the ugliness of their crimes - would repent insanity : critics say the exact opposite occurred and a life of isolation inside these strict , haunting walls drove many of them to madness too late : the solitary confinement system was eventually discarded but @entity69 is widely thought to have induced mental illness in many of its inhabitants since 1996 it has been a museum and @entity193 attraction but visitors still report eerie sightings and noises from the once - notorious prison			1
tourists claim there have been mysterious footsteps in the yard , the sound of pacing in empty cells and strange noises drifting through the ever - cold hallways			0
@entity142 12 has become infamous for reports of chilling laughter and one guard tower sometimes appears to be occupied by a shadowy figure keeping watch over @entity69			2
@entity211 , who helps maintain the crumbling old locks at the prison told @entity98 that he felt a force grip him so tight in @entity142 4 that he was immobilised			0
he described a negative , horrible energy that exploded out of the cell and claims tormented faces appeared on the cell walls and one in particular took hold of him .			0
