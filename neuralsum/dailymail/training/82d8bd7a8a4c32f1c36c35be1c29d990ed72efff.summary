a mother whose cancer has returned for the third time has turned her back on modern medicine - and says she will try to overcome the disease through healthy living and alternative therapies			1
@entity8 , 41 , has been treated for breast cancer twice since 2010			1
during this time , she has undergone two mastectomies , six rounds of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy			1
after beating the disease twice , ms @entity8 found a lump on her rib cage in october 2014 and doctors confirmed the cancer had returned for a third time			1
despite being told the disease will kill her if she does n't embark on more chemotherapy , she has opted out of further treatment			1
instead , she and has decided to beat cancer on her own , by eating healthily , running marathons and using alternative therapies			1
@entity8 , 41 , beat breast cancer twice before , undergoing two mastectomies , chemotherapy and radiotherapy ( she is pictured , left , after a mastectomy )			1
now the cancer has returned , she has decided to try and overcome it on her own by eating healthily , running marathons ( right ) and seeking alternative treatments after being diagnosed with cancer in 2010 , ms @entity8 , who is a sible parent to @entity37 , 16 , and @entity38 , 13 , continued going to work - only taking time off for hospital appointments - as she feared the family would n't survive financially if she was n't working ms @entity8 , a customer services manager who lives in @entity44 with her two children @entity37 , 16 , and @entity38 , 13 , said : ' in my opinion , chemotherapy and radiotherapy do n't cure cancer			1
' that kind of treatment is just a temporary thing and the cancer does come back a few years later			1
' it nearly killed me and was tough for my kids , so i decided i 'd never put my body through it again			0
' instead i took up running			1
' i 've also drastically altered my diet , i go for oxygen therapy every week and see a homeopath			1
i 'm determined to get better this way			0
' at her latest hospital appointment this month , ms @entity8 was told the tumour has grown since october			1
yet she is still refusing any help from the @entity65 , except for examinations every three months			1
she also disagrees with claims by doctors that is she allowing herself to die			0
consultant oncologist professor @entity69 said there is no evidence a healthy diet , exercise and alternative therapies will cure ms @entity8 ’s cancer			1
however , her treatment is her own choice and doctors must respect that , he added			1
he told @entity80 : ‘ the patient is always in the driving seat ; their treatment is up to them			2
‘ i would try and persuade her to have two cycles of chemotherapy , as i ’m sure her doctor is doing			2
‘ there ’s no evidence that diet alone will help without the chemotherapy			2
‘ with the chemotherapy , a healthy diet and exercise is beneficial			2
‘ but it ’s not a cure , you need conventional treatment too			1
‘ different people react to cancer in different ways and one has to respect that			2
‘ oxygen therapy and homeopathy , these alternative therapies offer false hope			1
‘ there ’s no evidence they work			0
a lot of people believe they work and that is the problem			0
‘ alternative therapists will have great stories of people who have benefitted from their therapy , but they wo n’t give you the real statistics , because the facts show it does n’t work			2
‘ i would recommend having conventional treatment , and then by all means , have alternative therapies as well if you really like , but do n’t replace the former with the latter			2
’ she said : ' i do n't want to put my body through any more trauma			2
i want to try and treat this with natural methods			0
' my oncologist is n't very happy , but it 's my body after all			2
i am not in denial or giving up - i 've even registered for a half marathon on @entity134 this summer			0
' but i have lost faith in @entity65			1
i wish they would consider working together with natural treatment , but instead i 'm having to go it alone			2
' her first diagnosis came in january 2010 , after she noticed her left breast had become misshapen			1
she said : ' it was a huge blow			0
my ex-husband is no longer around and i was terrified at the thought of leaving the kids behind if something were to happen to me			0
' i was desperate to get better for their sakes			0
' the tumour was quite large , about 7cm long , so i said yes to everything my doctor suggested			2
' i had chemotherapy from february until june , then a mastectomy , followed by radiotherapy for two months			1
' she had finished her treatment by september 2010 , but describes those months as ' such a struggle '			1
she said : ' i 'd been very honest with the kids about what was happening to me , so it was a horrible time for all three of us			0
' it did n't help that i had to work throughout the whole ordeal , while feeling sick and exhausted , ' i was an office manager at the time and did n't feel we could cope financially if i left my job , so i stayed at work and only took time off for hospital appointments			2
' i put a post on @entity169 asking for advice , sort of a cry for help			0
' an old friend got in touch who had beaten cancer himself and it all started from there			2
he gave me a few tips to gradually change my lifestyle			0
' it was a step - by - step way to get back to normal after cancer			2
' my new diet was mainly based on alkaline foods			0
lots of greens , avoiding anything with sugar and wheat , avoiding most meats			0
ms @entity8 began chemotherapy in january , and says the treatment was a ' struggle '			1
her body suffered further the following january , when , during breast reconstruction surgery , her lung was punctured			2
she is pictured during chemotherapy in october 2014 , she was told her cancer had returned , but she refused surgery or chemotherapy			1
' i decided it was all too invasive			0
i started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers , which i now go to twice a week , ' she said			1
she is pictured with her family during earlier treatment ' dairy produce has been linked to breast cancer too , so that was a major thing i cut out			1
' she also started exercising carefully			0
initially , a ten minute walk would leave her exhausted			0
but she became fitter , building up how far she could walk , until she could jog and run			0
finally , she signed up for the @entity210 to keep herself motivated			0
she said : ' running the marathon in april 2012 was a huge achievement			2
i felt so much better , as though i was finally getting back to myself			0
' but a subsequent medical appointment in january 2014 led to doctors picking up on a second tumour			0
ms @entity8 was told in january her tumour had grown			1
but she is determined to keep refusing @entity65 treatment , and is undergoing oxygen therapy ms @entity8 said : ' i think a lot of things cause cancer and one of the main things is stress			1
i 'd been made redundant the year before , we 'd packed up and moved miles from our home , plus i 'm originally from @entity228 so none of my family were close by to support me			0
' initially , she thought doctors had made a mistake			0
' i was in complete denial , ' she said			0
' i thought they could n't possibly be right as i was on my new diet and i was still training			0
' but obviously they were right			0
it was alarming - the tumour was so big			0
there was a big lump as well as a spotted tumour all over the breast			1
' she underwent a second mastectomy in march 2014 but she refused another ' damaging ' bout of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
instead , she maintained her fitness despite the diagnosis , having signed up to run the @entity251 in october 2014 and a week before running the marathon , a doctor discovered cancer cells next to a scar on her right breast			1
she said : ' doctors wanted me to have a ct scan right away but i refused , as the rays are 200 times more powerful than an x-ray			0
' they then scheduled surgery to remove the cancerous cells , but at the last minute i cancelled the operation			0
' i decided it was all too invasive			0
i started researching other ways to treat cancer and found out about the oxygen chambers , which i now go to twice a week			1
' i have drops prescribed by a homeopath and i take shots of bicarbonate soda with lemon juice			0
' i 've also been in touch with a woman who runs a treatment centre in @entity276			0
' she beat cancer using natural methods , so she 's going to help me raise money for treatment			1
the first step is having my mercury fillings removed			0
