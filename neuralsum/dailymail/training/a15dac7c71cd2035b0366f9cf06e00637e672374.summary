what 's the best country to live in the world ? well it 's no other than @entity4 , as for the best place to live , that gong goes to the country 's capital , @entity9			1
the @entity10 , @entity10 has ranked the 362 regions of its 34 member nations according to nine measures of well - being which include income and education			2
each were given a score out of ten			0
@entity4 led the world ranking with a tidy 76.5 out of 90 , following by @entity20 at 72.3 , @entity21 , @entity22 and then the @entity23			2
@entity4 topped the world list for the best country to live , it 's scorecard 76.5 out of 90 although education only scored a 6.6 out of 10 the nation 's capital , @entity9 , has been voted as the best place to live by @entity10 beating out @entity30 and @entity31 despite being known for @entity32 and it 's popularity with visitors , @entity9 was named the best place to live in the world			1
while @entity4 's scorecard was good enough to see it named best country to live the country that did n't fare so well was @entity41 , which ranked the worst country to live with a measley 15.1 out of 90 scoring zero for safety , housing and accessibility to services			1
@entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 were also judged as some of the hardest places in the world to live			0
all well - being scores out of 10 * education - 6.6 * @entity54 - 8.4 * income - 7.3 * safety - 9.8 * health - 9 * environment - 9.5 * @entity56 - 10 * accessibility to services - 7.2 * housing - 8.7 an earlier version of the report was released in june but since then it has been updated to include one more measure of well being , which is access to affordable and quality housing			1
that got a commendable score of 8.7 out of 10 , while civic engagement took out the honours with full marks of 10 , following closely behind was safety , environment and health			1
even the low performing regions in @entity4 fare better than the @entity10 average in all of the well - being measures			1
but surprisingly @entity4 will have to work on its education which received a 6.6 , well behind countries such as @entity21 , the @entity76 and @entity77 which recorded a high 9			0
the share of the workforce with at least a secondary degree in the bottom 20 per cent of regions in @entity4 is 13 percentage points lower than the @entity10 average			2
the @entity10 has pointed out , large regional disparities in education , health , jobs and key services can damage economic growth which in turn will lower well - being outcomes at a national level			0

@entity4 topping the world as the best country to live @entity4 scored 76.5 out of 90 based on nine well - being measures and reached number one in the world as the best country to live with beautiful places like the @entity101 ( pictured ) to visit @entity103 's white house ( pictured ) the @entity23 was among the top countries to live in the world with @entity4 topping the list while some would argue that @entity30 has the best beaches and harbour while @entity31 's pubs and cafes are a talking point , the nation 's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital , @entity9			1
the territory received three top 10 scores , more than any other region included on the list , for safety , income and civic engagement			1
even its lowest score , for the environment , was still a massive 9.1			0
of all the nine indicators , @entity9 total score was 86.2 out of a possible 90 , thrashing the country 's well being average			2
the nation 's capital was ranked the best place to live in the world while living conditions in @entity9 might be top class , it has built up a reputation as a boring city with little to do @entity9 is truly the place to visit all - year round			1
during summer it 's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country as the political heartland of the country , @entity9 , along with six other of our state 's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning @entity4 is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else			1
the high number of voter engagement , about 95 per cent , was taken from the 2013 federal election and largely reflects the fact that voting in @entity4 is mandatory			0
@entity4 had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election			0
voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights			0
the statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified , and it terms of its murder rate - that 's practically non existent			2
@entity9 has the lowest murder rate across @entity4 averaging just one in 100,000 people			0
it 's commonly confused that @entity30 , and not @entity9 , is referred to as @entity4 's capital city			1
despite its knockers , @entity9 seems to be making its place on the world stage			0
a @entity191 article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the ' glitzier city of @entity30 ' and ' there are no beaches or iconic opera houses ' it does have ' big - sky beauty , breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly			0
' the best way to enjoy @entity9 , the @entity191 said , is ' with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur - crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas			0
' @entity207 in @entity22 , one of the top countries in the world to live , with @entity4 coming in at first unlike most cities , @entity9 was purposefully built as the nation 's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts income 10/10 safety 10/10 civic engagement 10/10 health 9.9/10 accessibility to services 9.6/10 @entity54 9.6/10 environment 9.5/10 education 9.1/10 housing 8.5/10 it also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital 's premier attractions , it 's lake			1
but it is n't just any lake , it was named after @entity229 man , @entity228 , who designed the capital built in the centre of @entity31 and @entity30			0
@entity233 's score for education is 5.6 , putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the @entity10 regions			0
the @entity237 is high on the list , in the top 19 per cent , but when it comes to the country 's natural environment , look no further than @entity233 , @entity242 and @entity243 which all score a perfect 10 out of 10			2
the @entity245 does n't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state 's and territories , scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for @entity250 health score is in the @entity10 's bottom 29 per cent , while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent			1
@entity9 and the @entity237 can count itself a lucky place to live , with a higher average income , civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the @entity10 list the war museum in @entity9 , it was revealed recently , was @entity4 's number one tourist attraction @entity263 was named in honour of @entity265 , the @entity229 - born architect which designed the capital city from scratch @entity233 , along with @entity243 and @entity242 , scored 10 out of 10 in the environment category the @entity245 does n't fare quite as well as its neighboring states and territories , scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety			1
