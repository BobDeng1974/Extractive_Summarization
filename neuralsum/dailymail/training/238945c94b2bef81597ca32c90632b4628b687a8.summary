by @entity0 for @entity1 in the film @entity3 , @entity2 plays a woman who falls in love with a violent escaped criminal with a penchant for peach pie and a heart of gold			0
but while it might sound romantic , the reality , as @entity12 author @entity13 points out , is quite different			1
' these women are looking for romance with a capital r and all its ups and downs and thrills and excitement , ' she explains			2
' the love is not real but delusional love - it ’s not the companionable love that a healthy person seeks but a stage one , always exciting , romance			0
' but the consequences can be appalling , with many abandoning families while more still end up behind bars themselves			0
among them is @entity47 , now 54 , from @entity48 , whose happy family life was ripped apart after she fell in love with convicted murderer @entity52 , now 33			1
' she decided to take a risk and rescue dogs and prisoners at the same time by founding @entity57 in @entity58 in august 2004 , ' says @entity13 , who interviewed @entity47 for her book			1
convict : @entity52 ( left ) and mother - of - two @entity47 ( right ) went on the run together home : both halves of the couple had spent most of their lives in @entity58 or in the local correctional facility ' the men ’s prison at @entity70 gave her security clearance so she could move her mutts in and out and she worked with prisoners who had good records , helping them train dogs			1
' the programme was so successful that , within 18 months , 800 dogs had been trained and adopted by @entity48 families			0
' but unbeknown to prison authorities , @entity47 who was married with two grown - up sons , had grown close to @entity52 and just a year after the affair began , decided to run away with him			1
on the morning of 12th february 2006 , she arrived at the prison driving her white van as normal			0
but when the van drove out a couple of hours later , it was carrying an extra passenger - @entity52 , concealed in one of the dog crates in the back			2
speaking two years after the escape , @entity47 said that everything she did was coloured by the depression she was suffering , caused by the loss of a child 20 years previously			1
' he was just someone i could really talk to , ' she told a local tv channel			0
' we could talk about anything			0
i was very unhappy , and i was so depressed			2
' remote : the couple drove 700 miles to a hidden log cabin near @entity106 in @entity107 entertainment : @entity52 spent his days watching convict film @entity109 ? carrying an overnight bag containing $ 25,000 in cash , two of her husband ’s semi-automatic pistols , black hair dye , a razor , books , videos , puzzles and sex toys , she and @entity52 drove 700 miles into @entity107 where a remote log cabin awaited them			2
' in @entity126 , @entity107 , the couple settled into a life of domesticity as well as sexual experimentation , ' explains @entity13			1
' @entity52 played music from the jailbreak film @entity109 ? and tried to make new identity papers			0
' he watched porn dvds and used a @entity134 while @entity47 did puzzles , read pop fiction , and wrote in her journal			1
sometimes she dressed up , and the couple experimented with whips and sex toys			2
' but less than three weeks after they escaped , the couple 's log cabin was surrounded by police and the two were arrested			1
@entity52 had 10 years added to his already lengthy sentence			0
@entity47 was given 15 months and was eventually released in may 2008 , returning home to be handed a divorce by her husband and attempt to rebuild her relationship with her sons			1
' some days it took all my energy not to break apart a razor and cut my wrists in my room , ' she told @entity162 ahead of her release			0
' the women [ who have relationships with prisoners ] are emotionally damaged but probably no more than most of us , ' comments @entity13			1
' they are looking for a partner who makes them feel whole , which is kind of what all of us do , although i would hope that a healthier person would seek someone who could live a real life in the real world			0
' a relationship with a man in prison is not real in that its parameters are controlled by the prison rules and the prison walls - it ’s not the real world			2
' and yet despite the risks and the unreality , women like @entity47 and like @entity2 's @entity3 character @entity185 continue to pursue relationships with convicts			1
' one that stands out is a woman who was a juror on a murder trial , ' says @entity13			2
' she helped convict a man and then after visiting him in prison , she fell for him , left her husband and children , job and extended family , and moved to live near the prison			0
damaged : like @entity3 's @entity185 , many of the women @entity13 interviewed were damaged ' another story that shocked me was a young woman who fell in love with her grandmother ’s murderer			1
' so why do these doomed romances continue to happen ? @entity13 has several theories but says one standout similarity is that nearly all of the women involved were abuse victims , whether in previous relationships or during childhood			1
' my theory is that for them , relationships with convicted murderers behind bars are " safe " , ' she explains			0
' the men in prison ca n't hurt these women who have been so abused and therein lies their appeal , or at least part of it			2
' also , men in prison for life have a lot of time on their hands and can devote many , many hours to these relationships , ' she adds			0
' they write long love letters , love poems , paint pictures and so on , showering the women with the kind of romantic attention that just is not that common outside prison walls			0
' attention that damaged women such as @entity47 and @entity3 's @entity185 just ca n't resist - whoever it comes from			1
@entity3 is out on blu - ray and dvd now			0
