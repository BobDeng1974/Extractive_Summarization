she already has a stellar music career , her own fragrance and a beauty line with @entity4 - all to the tune of a reported £ 170m - but @entity6 clearly wants world domination			1
the @entity9 singer , who took home the best - dressed gong at the prestigious @entity12 awards this year , may well be launching her own fashion range			2
the 26 - year - old , who has already designed collections for @entity16 and @entity17 , has filed trademark documents in her surname , @entity20 , for apparel , lingerie , hats , sleepwear , cosmetics and swimwear			1
she also lent her fashion expertise to styled to @entity39 , where she assisted up - and - coming @entity41 designers with their clothing lines			2
in february 2013 , the singer presented her first women 's collection at @entity46 for @entity17			1
the sporty urban range was such a hit that she released two more collections for the high street giant			2
let 's hope she 's venturing into fashion ! the documents have been filed with the @entity33 under her @entity54 , and has assigned the ' @entity20 ' mark well , it makes sense ! the global style icon has sat front row at countless fashion shows and modelled for numerous high fashion brands like @entity62 a regular on the @entity46 front rows , she has also lent her good looks to countless high fashion campaigns and topped best dressed lists around the world			1
@entity69 , trademark attorney at @entity70 in @entity71 , said : ' it ’s natural for global celebrities like @entity6 to want to trademark all the insignia for which they are known , and the best time to register a trademark is prior to launch , as is the case for the @entity20 brand			1
' trademarks can include names , nicknames , signatures , slogans and poses and it ’s important for celebrities to have their legal protection in order at the outset			2
' celebrities are global brands , now more than ever before			2
a successful trademark registration will ensure @entity6 has the monopoly over her brand			1
if celebrities do not capitalise on their trademarks , no doubt there will be someone else who is waiting in line to do it for them			2
' whilst @entity6 made her name as a performer , her name and image can be used to sell a huge array of merchandise from clothing to cosmetics			1
this can generate an income that outlives her years as an entertainer , and has the potential to become her most important asset , and her lasting legacy			0
an example is the tennis champion @entity113 , whose name is associated with sportswear and fashion , over and above his tennis career			0
' fashionable friends : @entity6 ( right ) is close with model @entity119 ( centre ) and @entity122 ( back ) , would they model her range ? ' the best way for celebrities to protect their name for product ranges like fashion is to get a trade mark registration			1
this effectively guarantees that no - one else can use their name without permission			0
it 's becoming an increasing trend for celebrity artists to cash in on their name by diversifying into fashion lines , added @entity137 , head of fashion at law firm @entity139			0
and if that was n't enough , it seems that her trip to @entity144 for the tail - end of the @entity146 may have been equal parts business and pleasure			0
according to reports , the @entity150 singer has her eyes firmly fixed on buying a @entity41 football club , after she 's set up a soccer academy in her native @entity9			0
practice makes perfect : in february 2013 , the singer presented her first women 's collection at @entity46 for @entity17 a source said : ' at first we thought @entity6 's desire to be involved with soccer on a business level would soon blow over			1
we figured she was still on a high from the @entity146			0
' but now it 's becoming clear she really is serious			0
she 's talking about setting up a football academy in her native @entity9			0
then her big dream is to be involved with a @entity41 club			0
' while @entity6 has designs on getting her hands on a @entity41 team , the 26 - year - old beauty has also reportedly been considering options closer to her @entity175 home			1
a source told the @entity177 : ' @entity41 is like a second home to her , although she 's also hinted she may do something with an @entity181 team			0

@entity6 , 26 , has filed trademark documents in her surname , @entity20
*categories* include apparel , lingerie , sleepwear , cosmetics and swimwear
has already designed for @entity16 and @entity17
