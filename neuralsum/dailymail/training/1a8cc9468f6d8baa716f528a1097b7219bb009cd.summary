@entity0 gave @entity1 a sobering start to the new year on friday by handing him a crushing defeat , although a new injury concern prevented it from being a perfect afternoon for the @entity5			1
the @entity7 champion , playing for the first time since october after undergoing surgery on his appendix , was hammered 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 by @entity0 in the season 's unofficial curtain raiser in @entity13			1
while @entity1 was shown how much work he needs to catch up , @entity0 's only concern after a highly impressive display was some stiffness in his left shoulder			1
' it 's sore and i 've never had that issue before , i 'll see how i wake up , ' said the 27 year - old @entity5			2
@entity0 celebrates as he thrashes @entity1 in the semi-final of the @entity13 exhibition event @entity1 plays a forehand during his last - four clash against @entity0 at the @entity26 he will have a precautionary scan in the hope that it is nothing more than early season aches before he is scheduled to play in what is nominally the final of the @entity33 exhibition event against @entity34			1
@entity0 had looked contrastingly sharp to @entity35 's finest , who has only played seven matches in all since @entity38 , and clearly lacks match sharpness and fitness			2
having played a surprisingly tough two and a half hour match against @entity42 the day before , the world no 6 came back out and thumped @entity1 - giving him a first win of sorts against a player from the top three since undergoing back surgery in september 2013			1
it already looks clear that his time spent in @entity51 last month with @entity52 was no less rigourous than previous training blocks under the guidance of @entity55			0
@entity0 stretches to play a volley at the net as he storms to victory in @entity13 a general view of the stadium in @entity13 's @entity62 as @entity1 takes on @entity0 ' you never know how you are going to feel until you get out on the match court , ' said @entity0			1
' today was an improvement and i 'm pleased			0
all the hard work is paying off			0
' there were a lot of long games , it should n't really have been that scoreline			0
he had a lot of game points but i was able to win the important points			0
' @entity1 did threaten the @entity0 serve , but could not convert one of his twelve break points in a match of proper intensity			1
on many occasions when he pressured @entity0 he threw in unforced errors to let him recover			0
this is what happens when you have not played much and he will doubtless improve , but it is unlikely that the official @entity88 season opener in @entity89 next week will be enough to get him fully firing in time for the first @entity90 of the year , which begins in @entity91 on january 19			0
@entity0 scrambles to his right to play a forehand back to his @entity35 opponent @entity1 approaches the net to play a volley in the semi-final exhibition match in the @entity98 while no ranking points are at stake @entity0 will already have been encouraged by beating @entity1 so easily , especially after the drubbing received at the hands of @entity103 in the @entity104 in november			1
little , in truth , can be read into these kind of events , but what should be encouraging to @entity0 is the way he moved so well at this embryonic stage of the season			0
there were fewer forays to the net than the previous day , but then @entity1 's groundstrokes are not what you want to test your volleying skills against			2
@entity0 's serve did look vulnerable at times but , like his vanquished opponent , he knows that many aspects can be sharpened up with a volume of matches .			2

@entity0 beat @entity1 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 in the semi-final clash
it is his first win against a top - four player since july 2013
@entity0 will take on @entity34 in *saturday* 's final
the @entity134 no 1 *complained* afterwards of stiffness in his shoulder
