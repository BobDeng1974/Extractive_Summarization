@entity0 gave @entity1 a couple of hefty slaps to the head as he refused to hand over the ball – appearing less like encouragement for the impending penalty kick and more like , ' what the hell are you doing ? ' that was exactly what @entity12 manager @entity11 was thinking on the touchline as his winger , who had never taken a @entity17 spot - kick , refused to hand the ball over to @entity0 who has scored 15 of the 16 he 's struck			1
afterwards , @entity11 claimed he hooked @entity1 at half - time of the goalless draw with @entity21 due to a hamstring injury on monday evening			1

@entity115 had already scored two penalties against @entity117 and @entity118 in december , but while the nation were tucking into their @entity121 dinner leftovers @entity108 insisted on taking one when he went down in the box against @entity109			0
@entity115 made way , but @entity108 struck a weak penalty which was easily saved by @entity126			2
he did , however , make up for it by scoring the first and setting up the second in a 2 - 1 win			2
