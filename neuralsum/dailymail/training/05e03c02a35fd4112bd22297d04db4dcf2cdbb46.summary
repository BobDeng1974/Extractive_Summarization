in one of the worst ever cases of multiple @entity9 failings , patients were left begging for water or left hungry after trays of food were dumped too far from their reach – and one man died of starvation			1
another elderly patient had his ribs ‘ broken open ’ when staff dragged him off a bed with a hoist while others were left lying in their own mess for hours at a time			1
neglect : @entity25 said husband @entity26 wasted away because staff did not know how to fit a feeding tube one woman of 86 , a former @entity9 nurse , was left unwashed and lying in her own faeces for 11 weeks because nurses were ‘ too busy ’ to help her into a bath			1

on his death certificate , inanition , a clinical term for starvation , was recorded as the cause of death			0
@entity76 from @entity77 , which represented the victims , said it was the first time in her ten years as a human rights lawyer that she had come across starvation being given as the primary cause of death			1
she added : ‘ the failings we uncovered were appalling			2
vulnerable and elderly patients were left starving and thirsty , with drinks left out of reach , buzzers ignored and people not being taken to the toilet and instead left to sit in their own faeces by the very people meant to be caring for them			1
‘ the families wanted an apology above all else and that is what they will now receive , in writing			2
’ the incidents took place between 2002 and 2011 , with 35 cases brought against the @entity35 and three against the @entity102 , in @entity103			0

most are around £ 10,000			0
the lawsuit began last summer after @entity56 spot checks found ‘ major concerns ’ at the @entity36 hospital and also @entity119 in @entity120			0
relatives contacted @entity77 , who were involved in legal action on behalf of families caught up in the scandal at @entity125 where it was estimated that up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily between 2005 and 2008			1
apology : @entity35 's head of nursing read the statement outside the hospital today appalled : health secretary @entity33 has said he is ' disgusted ' by the patients ' and families ' accounts mr @entity33 said the @entity37 class action highlighted the ‘ sort of “ care ” that should simply not happen in the @entity9 ’			1
last month , he said there was a ‘ kind of normalisation of cruelty ’ in the worst hospitals , with patients too often subjected to resentment , indifference and even contempt			0
in 2010 - 11 death rates at the @entity149 were 10 per cent higher than the national average			0
yesterday the trust said some of the ‘ very serious allegations ’ were ‘ not borne out by the medical notes ’ , but admitted ‘ certain aspects of care ’ fell below standards patients were entitled to expect			1
