by @entity1 reporter published : 10:11 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 25 september 2013 the evidence that sealed the convictions of @entity5 and @entity6 for the murder of @entity10 student @entity8 is far from conclusive , a new investigation claims			1
on the eve of the retrial of the former lovers in @entity15 , a documentary has asked five key questions about the case against them			2
miss @entity19 , 21 , a @entity20 student from south @entity21 , had her throat slashed on november 1 , 2007 , at her apartment in @entity24 , @entity25			1
she shared the flat with @entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity27 and her @entity25 boyfriend @entity6 faced trial the following year and were also found guilty			1
@entity27 was sentenced to 26 years and @entity6 25 but their guilty verdicts were quashed in 2011 and @entity27 returned to @entity28			1
however , this year the @entity25 courts made the decision to have a retrial			2
it opens on monday and could last a month - but @entity27 is not attending			1
if she is found guilty again , @entity25 could apply for her extradition			2
on the case : the new investigation follows criminal lawyer @entity48 , left , for the prosecution , and criminal litigator @entity50 , for the defence , as they scrutinise evidence to try to find out the truth the new investigation - conducted for a @entity58 documentary - follows criminal lawyer @entity48 , for the prosecution , and criminal litigator @entity50 , for the defence , as they scrutinise the case in an attempt to find out what happened			1
using a purpose - built reconstruction of the @entity65 , the @entity24 home shared by @entity19 and @entity27 , the opposing lawyers set about a csi - style investigation , consulting with crime - scene specialists including experts in glass shatter , self defence , dna and sound			1
employing high - speed cameras , forensic powder and hi - tech audio equipment , they attempt to answer five key questions that remain about one of the most infamous murders of the last decade			2
original investigation : forensic investigators are seen at work in the @entity65 , the @entity24 home shared by @entity19 and @entity27 , the day after miss @entity19 was found dead with her throat cut reconstructed : using this purpose - built reconstruction of the flat shared by @entity19 and @entity27 , the two lawyers set about a csi - style investigation , consulting with experts in glass shatter , self defence , dna and sound @entity94 killer ? @entity8 was found guilty of miss @entity19 's murder after a fast track trial in 2008 in the 2009 trial it was argued that miss @entity19 's body showed few or no defence wounds			1
to the prosecution it meant multiple people had to be involved in her murder - restraining meredith while she was killed			2
but the defence argued that it would have been possible for @entity106 to commit the crime on his own			2
for the tv investigation @entity109 , a martial arts expert , used a set exactly the same size , layout and dimensions as the villa in which miss @entity19 was killed			1
he tested if he could restrain a model and inflict the fatal knife wound without the help of others and found that one person could have carried out the attack			2
however , he said , to do so would have been ' considerably more difficult '			2
mr @entity50 said : ' i do n't think that was conclusive			2
' on the night of the murder a smashed window was discovered in the room of @entity128 , flatmate of miss @entity19 and @entity27			1
the rock used to break the glass lay inside			0
to the defence , this was @entity106 's way in			0
but the prosecution argued that this was a cover - up to hide the killer 's tracks			0
how was the window broken ? glass shatter specialist @entity139 investigated the physics of the smashed window that was discovered in the room of @entity128 , flatmate of miss @entity19 and @entity27 to establish whether the window was broken from inside or out , the investigation lawyers recruited forensic glass specialist @entity139			1
returning to the scale set , mr @entity139 set about throwing a similar rock through a window from the outside - in and then repeated it from the inside - out			0
after consulting the limited crime scene photographs , he concluded that it was ' more likely ' that the rock had come from the outside			0
he said examining ridge marks of the shards of glass would conclusively determine the direction the rock was thrown			0
ms @entity153 and mr @entity50 examine the broken window : after consulting the limited crime scene photographs , mr @entity139 concluded that it was ' more likely ' that the rock had come from the outside during the 2009 trial the prosecution case relied heavily on placing both @entity27 and @entity6 at the scene			1
traces of @entity6 's dna were found on miss @entity19 's bra clasp			1
but at the appeal case his lawyers argued that the clasp had been moved by police and contaminated			0
to test if this theory could be correct , the documentary team consulted @entity169 , an expert in forensics			0
a full - scale replica of @entity8 's bedroom : traces of @entity6 's dna were found on the scene on miss @entity19 's bra clasp			1
but at the appeal his lawyers argued that the clasp had been contaminated by police he applied colourless powder on his hands ( a substitute for @entity161 ) before shaking hands with the lawyers			0
lights showed how the powder was transferred easily			0
@entity50 said : ' the police conducted a @entity185 investigation based on presumption , conjecture and intuition and it frightens me to death to think that you can go to jail for a very long time based on that evidence			2
' did he leave the footprint ? @entity6 was convicted alongside @entity27 of miss @entity19 's killing , but his conviction was also quashed on appeal an unidentified bloody footprint was found on a bathmat in miss @entity19 's home			1
its size appeared too big to be @entity27 's but if the prosecution could prove it belonged to @entity6 , then it would place him at the murder scene			1
according to the tv prosecution , @entity6 has a unique arched toe			1
forensic podiatrist dr @entity208 carried out a test using ink and a sheet			0
it demonstrated that an arched toe would provide distinct imprints in either a walking or a standing position			0
dr @entity217 recommended further footprint tests should be taken at the retrial			0
@entity50 said : ' that could make a difference in terms of identifying the print and whether it is @entity6 's or not			1
' @entity48 agreed a similar test at the trial could be crucial to the defence or prosecution case			0
placing more than one person at the crime scene could prove vital to the prosecution 's case			0
key witness @entity232 claims to have heard at least two people running away from the scene			0
sound engineer dr @entity235 was called in by the documentary team to establish whether noise of someone running on the metal stairs outside @entity8 's home could be heard from inside @entity232 's flat			1
using high - tech audio equipment , dr @entity235 concluded it was ' impossible ' to hear running on the metal stairs			0
guttieres said : ' we heard the audio specialist say " impossible " , you ca n't get any more conclusive an answer			0
' however , @entity48 argued the different conditions had to be considered before dismissing any of the witness testimonies			0
she said : ' we had different stairs , we had a different environment , we were in a different period of the year			0
' █ @entity254 — 5 @entity255 will air on @entity58 on thursday 26th september , 10pm .			0

investigation comes days before @entity27 and *ex-boyfriend* @entity6 are to be retried over the 2007 killing of @entity10 student @entity8
