despite the fact @entity30 has replaced @entity0 in recent weeks , @entity3 has publicly maintained the @entity32 international remains his ‘ no 1 ’ keeper			0
however , there were indications on saturday that @entity17 would be rested for the trip to @entity6 - a further hint towards the @entity38 now being the club ’s first choice - leaving @entity0 and @entity40 to battle it out to play against @entity6			2
