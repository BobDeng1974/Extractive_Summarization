@entity0 allowed himself to be eaten alive by a giant snake in a documentary for the @entity3 the @entity4 boasts the world ’s greatest variety of wildlife , but no one had ever seen anything quite like this			1
gliding through the dense , waterlogged vegetation was a 20ft long , 18 ½ st green anaconda — one of the world ’s most terrifying creatures			1
moving tentatively towards it was a man on his hands and knees pretending to be a wild boar — clad head to toe in a black armoured suit slathered in pig ’s blood			2
@entity0 was on a terrifying mission : to be eaten alive by the biggest and mightiest snake on @entity27			1
the 27 - year - old wildlife presenter and his ten - strong team had spent 60 days struggling up to the headwaters of the world ’s largest river , battling electric eels , floods and poachers			1
finally , they ’d found a snake that might be big enough to swallow @entity0 whole as the cameras rolled			1
tomorrow night in @entity40 , the @entity3 will broadcast the result of his experiment in its show eaten alive , despite protests from conservationists on both sides of the @entity48			1
the documentary — to be aired in the @entity50 on friday — will follow his stomach - churning quest into the very belly of the beast			1
the channel has refused to say exactly what ensued after the snake wrapped @entity0 in its coils			1
but he has explained what drove him to such extremes of apparent lunacy — and told of his fear as he realised the snake had accepted his invitation to subject him to one of the natural world ’s most lingering deaths			2
‘ i wanted to do something to grab people ’s attention to the plight of the disappearing rainforests , something completely crazy , ’ he told me this week			1
‘ everything else has been tried			0
’ whether his idea will ignite a debate about saving the forests or just terrify people even more about snakes remains to be seen			0
@entity0 , who has written the well - received book mother of @entity84 about exploring the region , says anacondas are misunderstood			1
he describes the species as a predator at the top of the food chain , with no natural foes except human beings — who wrongly see the snakes as a threat			0
they are in fact shy creatures , but they can be deadly when roused			0
reaching up to 30ft in length and 39 st , they live in or around water and are far thicker than the pythons of @entity103 and @entity104			0
they are not venomous but boast powerful jaws attached by elastic ligaments			0
@entity0 had already been bitten by one anaconda and seized by another — it took five people to pry it off him , by which time it had broken one of his ribs			1
the naturalist donned a crush - proof suit for the stunt which has been criticised by animal rights groups his bid to be eaten and , of course , rescued before perishing , was filmed last spring but the documentary took two years to prepare			1
its makers ’ main task was to ensure @entity0 did n’t end up like the snake ’s usual meals : crushed until he was asphyxiated			1
anacondas will bite their prey , such as wild pigs , with teeth that curve backwards — preventing the animal from breaking away			2
then they ’ll pull it into water if they can , wrapping it in coils that crush its bones to make swallowing it easier			2
the power of a giant anaconda ( they are always female , the males are much smaller ) is awe - inspiring			1
the force of constriction is equal to having a nine - ton bus on your chest , according to @entity0			1
happily , they rarely encounter people			0
but they will go after any prey that they can subdue and swallow			0
‘ an anaconda can stretch to three times its own girth , so a 20ft snake would easily encompass my shoulders , ’ says @entity0			1
for his experiment , he needed a lightweight but super-strong carbon - fibre suit to protect him from being crushed			1
one was created by a team of engineers , who used a 3d scan of his body to make sure it fit his 5ft 9in frame closely			0
it was also streamlined so he ’d be less likely to damage the snake ’s insides , and — crucially for @entity0 — its material would resist the anaconda ’s digestive fluids			1
the sealed suit was finished with built - in cameras and a radio mic so he could communicate with his watching team			1
doctors also made him swallow a capsule that would transmit his vital signs in case he was unable — or unwilling — to signal he was in trouble			0
‘ they knew i ’m the type who ’ll say “ i ’m fine , i ’m fine … ” until i ’m dead , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ we had to make sure i did n’t get crushed , but the suit took care of that			2
but if i was eaten , we were worried what would happen to my breathing system because i could have suffocated very quickly			2
’ his face mask was connected to a crush - proof hose that trailed behind him , leading to an three - hour oxygen supply			1
another hose removed the air he exhaled so it would n’t leak into the snake ’s stomach and kill it			0
next , the team had to find a suitable snake			0
they eventually encountered a vast beast in the dense foliage of the @entity206			0
then they had to ensure that it ate him			0
pig blood was slathered on the suit to make it smell more like prey			2
but @entity0 says : ‘ i had to provoke a defence response from the snake and turn it into a predator			1
i got down on all fours to make contact with it and simply let it bite me			0
’ the 27 - year - old would not reveal the result of the experiment but said he has not yet fully recovered snakes almost always eat their prey headfirst so it goes down more smoothly			1
‘ she nailed me right in the face , and the last thing i remember was her mouth open wide , straight in my face , and everything went black , ’ he tells me			0
‘ i went limp and let it constrict			0
all the while i was just thinking : “ eat , eat , eat ! ” ’ he describes the crushing feeling of the constriction as like being caught under a powerful wave			0
incredibly , it lasted for more than an hour			0
‘ she wrapped around me and i felt my suit cracking and my arms ripping out of their sockets , ’ he says			2
‘ it was absolutely terrifying			0
’ enveloped in the snake ’s coils , he could n’t see anything but he was able to radio back to his team to say he was alive			2
they had agreed that once he was in past his waist , they would pull him out before it became too difficult to extract him without damaging either him or the snake			0
there were doctors and vets on hand , he says , and his wife @entity259 , who ’s also a naturalist , was watching too			0
‘ she was keeping everybody else relaxed , saying : “ @entity0 will be fine			1
” ’ she was n’t entirely correct , though			0
@entity0 will not reveal until the programme airs how much of him was actually swallowed — but he says the snake ‘ beat the s * * * ’ out of him and came off a lot better from the encounter than he did			2
months later , he is still not entirely recovered			0
he has no problems about people calling his escapade a stunt , saying : ‘ the whole idea is to shock people			2
’ but he had n’t expected the volume of hate mail and even death threats he ’s attracted from animal - rights campaigners around the world			1
the campaign group @entity277 ( @entity277 ) judged from early reports of the experiment that the snake was ‘ tormented and suffered for the sake of ratings ’			2
the anaconda would have expended valuable energy in swallowing @entity0 and then regurgitating him , it argued			1
and dr @entity286 of the @entity287 , which covers the study of reptiles and amphibians , was ‘ horrified ’ by the project			0
‘ it demonstrates a complete disregard for animal welfare of the highest degree , ’ he said			0
‘ it would have been stressed beyond belief			0
’ if it ’s any comfort to his critics , so , surely , was @entity0 .			2

@entity0 wanted to bring attention to the plight of the rainforest
the 27 - year - old allowed himself to be bitten and eaten by an anaconda
wore a crush - proof suit for experiment that was filmed for a documentary
stunt has been *slammed* by animal rights campaigners across the world
eaten alive will be shown in @entity40 on the @entity3 on sunday
