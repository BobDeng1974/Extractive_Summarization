@entity0 has hit out at @entity1 for not being a ‘ real man ’ with ‘ real depth of experience ’			1
the former @entity6 chairman said that unlike major figures such as sir @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 , mr @entity1 had never had a ‘ proper job ’			1
instead , he said the prime minister had done nothing except be a special adviser and working in @entity15 for @entity16			2
@entity0 , pictured , launched an astonishing attack on @entity1 claiming the @entity12 has never had a proper job before entering politics unlike @entity8 , @entity9 or even @entity10 @entity0 , a former airline pilot , also criticised mr @entity1 ’s tactics in playing up the threat of a @entity24 - @entity23 government , and even suggested @entity6 voters north of the border vote tactically for @entity24			1
he told the @entity28 ’s @entity27 : ‘ i just can not read mr @entity1 ’s mind			1
it ’s a foreign country to me			1
‘ men like @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , were real men with real depths of experience			2
‘ they had not gone from school to university to being a special adviser to working in an advertising agency			0
’ he added : ‘ he does n’t have that hinterland of experience any more than mr @entity43			0
’ @entity0 also suggested that mr @entity1 ’s campaign tactics were pushing people into the arms of the @entity23 and @entity47			1
@entity0 accused mr @entity1 , pictured , of bungling the @entity49 referendum and annoying @entity51 voters ‘ having bungled the @entity49 referendum , it seems pointless to just irritate @entity49 by shouting at them from @entity57 , ’ the former cabinet minister under @entity53 said			1
‘ the @entity51 are irritated into voting for @entity47 , by being shouted at from @entity57 – and the @entity49 are irritated similarly			0
’ @entity0 also told @entity59 it was ‘ logical ’ for @entity49 to vote tactically for @entity24 in areas where @entity6 candidates stand no chance			2
‘ from the @entity68 ’ point of view we are not going to come home with a vast number of seats from @entity49 , ’ he said			0
