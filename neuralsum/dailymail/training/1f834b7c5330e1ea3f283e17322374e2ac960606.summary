by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 13 october 2013 you may not recognise its handsome @entity3 facade but it ’s likely you have taken a look inside @entity9 ’s @entity8 house before			1
the interior of the @entity12 property , which is for sale at £ 1.1 million , has been used as a set for numerous advertisements and fashion shoots			1
@entity9 ’s vast kitchen on the lower ground floor has been given a particularly large amount of screen time – culinary superstar @entity21 , @entity23 winner @entity22 and award - winning @entity8 restaurant @entity25 are among those who have recently used the space to film commercials to promote cookbooks			1
‘ it ’s the best kitchen for making cheese on toast , ’ she jokes modestly			2
where @entity9 ’s talents lie are as a film and tv producer and in finding locations for shoots , so it ’s perhaps not surprising her own home has been used as a set			1
she has also produced pop videos , for @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
her contacts in the film and music industry have undoubtedly helped her , but she believes there are several factors that make it attractive for location managers , so a buyer could , if they desired , continue to use it as a set			1
‘ the house is on a very wide road so there is good access for the crews ’ lorries , ’ she says			2
‘ it is also close to the centre of @entity8			1
’ owners of properties used in adverts are generously remunerated and often put up in high - class hotels while filming takes place			1
king of the kitchen : @entity23 winner @entity22 films a commercial in @entity9 's kitchen the house itself has an illustrious history , having been designed by early 19th century builder @entity85 , who built the east front of @entity88 and swathes of @entity90			2
in fact , @entity85 constructed the entire road as dwellings for his workforce : the house sizes are all different and they were built to reflect the rank of his staff			0
@entity9 says her house ’s large size suggests it was built for someone in a senior position			0
she bought the property 12 years ago because she wanted a @entity3 home and a south - west - facing garden			1
but she had to use her intuition and eye as a location manager to realise its potential			0
‘ it was owned by someone who had gone to live abroad and it had been used as a squat , ’ she recalls			0
‘ the kitchen was divided into lots of small rooms and the garden was in a right state			0
’ on location : the home is build in @entity3 style @entity9 stripped out walls to give an open - plan feel , in the process creating the vast kitchen with its central - island work station that has proved so attractive for photoshoots			1
the house now has three bedrooms , three reception rooms and two bathrooms			0
she also put in a conservatory and got to work in the garden , which looks so well - manicured and mature it ’s hard to believe it was used as a dumping ground by squatters just 12 years ago			1
‘ it gets so much light so the plants i put in have grown fantastically , ’ says @entity9 , who plans to move to a large flat she already owns when the house is sold			1
‘ i will miss the garden – it is not overlooked at all , which is very rare in @entity8			1
’ @entity9 , who was raised in @entity143 , @entity144 , is now a convert to the charms of life in the capital south of the @entity148 and believes the buyers of her house will appreciate what life has to offer in @entity12			0
‘ it ’s so green – there ’s @entity155 five minutes ’ walk away and @entity156 and @entity157 close by , ’ she says			0
she also says @entity12 has changed dramatically for the better in the 12 years she has lived there , with a variety of good - quality restaurants and pubs popping up			0
in fact , one of the local pubs proved particularly useful when @entity21 ’s team were at her house to film			2
‘ he arrived with a huge team of chefs and even my kitchen was n’t big enough so they ended up using the kitchen in the pub up the road to prepare food			0
’ @entity174 , area director for @entity175 , said : ‘ the house is a gem with its @entity179 history , but the interior is a real surprise			0
the ground floor has been turned into a magnificent space that is currently both a fabulous live - in kitchen but also a set for commercials			2
if kitchens sell houses , this one will go very quickly			0
