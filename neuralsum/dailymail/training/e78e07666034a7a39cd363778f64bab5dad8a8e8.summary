they are the most loyal of pets , so it is perhaps no surprise that dogs become jealous when we do n’t show the same level of devotion			1
a study found that dogs , like people , can experience envy			2
faced to watch their owner pet a potential rival , they snap , jump , paw and push			1
dogs exhibited jealous behaviour such as snapping and pushing when their owner displayed affection for the stuffed toy			1
stock image pictured while dog owners may not find the result very surprising , some scientists have argued that the complexity of thought behind jealousy makes it a uniquely human emotion			2
for centuries , dogs have been man 's best friend			2
but it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat			0
a study in @entity52 found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed ' social '			0
the researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions			0
but the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it 's monitor , and acted ' socially '			0
to find out if this was the case , the @entity20 researchers videoed 36 dogs in their own homes as their owners ignored them in favour of a stuffed dog , another toy or a book			1
the toy dog barked , whined and wagged its tail at the push of a button and the real dogs seemed to be taken in by the act			2
they were around twice as likely to push or touch their owner when he or she was petting and talking sweetly to the stuffed dog as when the owner was displaying the same behaviour towards the other toy			1
even fewer pushed or touched their owner when the book was being read aloud			1
just under a third of the dogs also tried to get between their owner and the stuffed animal and a quarter snapped at the ‘ other dog ’ but only one did so at the other toy and the book			1
the study found the dogs were around twice as likely to push or touch their owner when he or she was petting and talking sweetly to the false dog ( stock image pictured left ) as when the owner was displaying the same behaviour towards the bucket ( stock image pictured right ) @entity110 ( pictured ) was one of three border collies that inspired the study on dog jealousy this shows that the dogs were n’t simply reacting to the loss of attention and affection			1
instead , their main concern seemed to be that this attention and affection had been switched to another dog , the journal @entity124 reports			2
the fact that most of the pets tried to sniff the bottom of the toy dog also suggests that they thought it was real			0
researcher professor @entity131 said : ‘ our study suggests not only that dogs do engage in what appear to be jealous behaviours but also that they were seeking to break up that connection between the owner and a seeming rival			1
‘ we ca n’t really speak to the dogs ’ subjective experiences , of course , but it looks as though they were motivated to protect an important social relationship			0
’ she added that research into jealousy is important because it can have far - reaching consequences , including , at the extreme , murder			0
the professor said her findings suggest that jealousy is not uniquely human			0
nor is it simply tied to sex and romance			0
and with babies as young as six weeks seemingly capable of experiencing envy , it may have evolved as a way of ensuring that the very young can compete with siblings for parental love and help .			0

the @entity20 studied 36 dogs in their own homes
owners were told to ignore their pet in favour of a stuffed dog or a bucket
in a third test , the owner was asked to read a *musical* pop - up book
dogs exhibited jealous behaviour such as snapping and pushing when their owner displayed affection for the stuffed dog
this behaviour was twice as likely than when the owner touched the bucket
even fewer pushed or touched their owner when the book was being read
