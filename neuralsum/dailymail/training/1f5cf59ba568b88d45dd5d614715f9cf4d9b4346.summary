by @entity0 last updated at 10:36 am on 21st february 2012 @entity3 's shambolic @entity2 has routinely dropped or downgraded major immigration controls for the past five years without ministerial approval , a devastating report revealed last night			1
it found up to half a million @entity8 passengers arriving from @entity10 tourist resorts , including @entity11 , were waved into @entity3 without facing any anti-terror checks			1
the @entity14 nationals were not examined against the @entity16 ’s so - called @entity15 , which contains details of terrorists and dangerous criminals who must be refused entry to keep the public safe			0
concerns : home secretary @entity23 has revealed how security checks at @entity3 's borders have been routinely suspended , including on an occasion when immigration minister @entity27 authorised the downgrading the report also showed how millions of pounds was wasted on schemes which did not work , with ministers being regularly fed misleading information by civil servants			1
foreign students were let in if they ‘ appeared to be genuine ’			1
last night , as home secretary @entity23 announced that she is to split the dysfunctional agency into two , a terrifying culture of arrogance and incompetence emerged			0
the report , which was ordered after last year ’s revelations that senior civil servants were abandoning passport checks , provoked fury , with mps criticising @entity3 ’s ‘ @entity46 ’ immigration controls			1
yesterday ’s report also revealed how : the report , by @entity49 , chief inspector of the @entity50 , was commissioned last year following the so - called ‘ @entity52 ’ scandal			1
taking liberties : the official investigation into the relaxation of border checks last year found staff went ' over and beyond ' any scheme approved by ministers it saw former chief @entity61 resign after the home secretary accused him of weakening controls without her permission			1
yesterday ’s report appeared to clear ministers of downgrading checks , saying that border staff went ‘ beyond ’ what was approved			1
as the chief constable of @entity72 , @entity70 guided it to its current status as the safest in @entity76 and @entity77			2
he will leave the post to set up the @entity79 , a new government agency tasked with policing arrivals in @entity3			2
@entity81 , chair of @entity82 said : ' we are supporting this secondment of @entity70 to the @entity79 where he will be engaged in work of national importance			0
' we are sure he will make an invaluable contribution , and felt that his skills and experience should be made available in the national interest			0
' @entity70 became @entity92 's chief constable in january 2008 and under his leadership @entity92 has become the safest county in @entity76 and @entity77			2
' we know he will be greatly missed by the public , @entity72 and our partners			2
' @entity82 recognises , and is very grateful for , @entity70 's outstanding contribution to the policing of @entity92 and @entity99			0
' deputy chief constable @entity100 will take over from mr @entity70 until a new chief constable is appointed , which will not be until november at the earliest			0
the @entity82 said the new appointment would be a priority once a new commissioner had been sworn in on november 22			0
however , it revealed immigration minister @entity27 did authorise the downgrading of checks early last year			1
mrs may later made clear her opposition but this instruction was ignored			0
in her statement to @entity114 yesterday , she said that from next month the @entity79 – the part of the @entity50 responsible for checking those trying to enter the country – will be hived off			1
@entity72 chief constable @entity70 will replace mr @entity61 and will be ‘ directly accountable ’ to ministers , mrs may said			1
the remaining part of @entity50 will be responsible for processing immigration applications			1
mrs may told @entity114 : ‘ @entity123 report reveals a border force that suspended important checks without permission ; that spent millions on new technologies but chose not to use them ; that was led by managers who did not communicate with their staff ; and that sent reports to ministers that were inaccurate , unbalanced and excluded key information			1
’ @entity137 mp @entity136 said : ‘ this just shows that the @entity50 is a real @entity46 operation			1
unfortunately it is neither entertaining nor funny			0
it is run by clowns for their own advantage and convenience			0
’ the report revealed that since 2007 , passengers on trains arriving from @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity11 station @entity151 had their passports examined but no more detailed checks were carried out			1
separately , @entity15 checks were abandoned more than 350 times , mostly at so - called ‘ juxtaposed controls ’ – immigration posts in @entity10			1
agency records suggest the checks were abandoned for up to six hours at @entity160 , when staff were faced with traffic jams at the port and justified the suspension on ‘ health and safety grounds ’			1
the students scheme – codenamed @entity167 – operated during the peak rush of new arrivals from september last year			2
it allowed @entity172 officials to let in students from ‘ low risk ’ countries if they ‘ otherwise appeared to be genuine students ’			1
mr @entity49 said the policy was ‘ potentially unlawful ’			2
the report stated : ‘ we can not say whether any student was admitted into the @entity3 unlawfully under this initiative and any potential risks to security can not be quantified			2
’ chip reading facilities were ‘ deactivated ’ nearly 15,000 times at ten ports between january and june last year , mr @entity49 said			1
astonishingly , the @entity2 was ‘ unable to explain definitively why these deactivations occurred ’			2
yesterday ’s final , terminal blow for @entity50 follows a string of scandals for the immigration system going back years			2
in 2006 , then home secretary @entity192 branded the immigration system ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
the criticism was repeated by mps on the @entity196 in a report two years ago			0
mr @entity61 resigned in november last year claiming constructive dismissal			0
he is likely to receive a substantial payoff despite yesterday ’s report and a similar internal inquiry finding against him			0
lax : 500,000 @entity8 passengers boarded trains in @entity10 and arrived in the @entity3 without being checked against the warnings index of suspected terrorists and those with adverse immigration histories @entity210 : lord knows how many maniacs , having learned of this gaping hole in our already porous borders - and they do learn very quickly - piled in			1
read more here the internal review by former police officer @entity218 found mr @entity61 took the action he did because he wanted ‘ quick wins ’ to cut queues at airports			0
shadow home secretary @entity223 last night accused mrs may of ‘ passing the buck ’			0
‘ it is clear that on @entity23 ’s watch border controls were substantially weakened last summer compared to previous years , ’ she added			2
@entity228 , chairman of the @entity196 , said yesterday : ‘ the home secretary ’s proposals do not go far enough			0
‘ a separate border force will allow a more focused view on what is happening			0
however , there is a danger in assuming that structural changes will solve these problems			0
‘ what is needed is root and branch reform , not changing faces but cultures			0
this is day one for the future of @entity50			0
the home secretary should abandon her @entity247 approach and become a pit bull			0
otherwise her failures will come back to bite her			0
’ 2006 - the then home secretary @entity49 , now @entity211 , @entity192 , describes the immigration system as ' not fit for purpose ' with ' inadequate ' leadership 2008 - the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) is set up in response to @entity192 's remarks 2009 - a report by the @entity256 highlights a lack of detention space to support the asylum process june 2010 - november 2011 - @entity261 checks are suspended 482 times , including 463 times at @entity172 july 2011 - the former strategic immigration policy functions of @entity50 are moved to the @entity16 november 2011 - the @entity196 reports that the agency has shelved 124,000 deportation cases november 2011 - @entity61 , the @entity268 part of the @entity50 , resigns february 2012 - home secretary @entity23 announces @entity79 will split from @entity50			1

report shows thousands of @entity8 passengers were let in *unchecked*
millions wasted on schemes that did *n't* work
reveals immigration minister @entity27 did downgrade border checks
@entity72 chief to take charge of one part of new border agency
staff at @entity172 allowed foreign students into @entity3 last year – even if they did not have a valid visa ;
officials abandoned reading *expensive* *biometric* chips in passports nearly 15,000 times at ten ports between january and june last year ;
anti-terror checks were abandoned more than 350 times over the two years , mostly at ports in @entity10 , because long traffic jams were a ‘ health and safety ’ problem ;
such is the poor record - keeping at the agency , that the true implications of the border breaches may never be known ;
on a number of occasions , including the @entity8 *loophole* , @entity50 staff acted entirely without ministerial approval .
