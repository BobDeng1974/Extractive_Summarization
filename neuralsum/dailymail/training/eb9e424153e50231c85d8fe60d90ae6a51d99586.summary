the golden age of pantomime : @entity2 , spectacle and subversion in @entity4 by @entity5 often , i wonder what foreigners must think of us come @entity11 time ? the pantomime tradition is so wonderfully and eccentrically uniquely @entity13			1
the daft catchphrases ( ‘ it ’s behind you ! ’ ; ‘ oh no it is n’t ’ ; ‘ oh yes it is ! ’ ) , the oo - err - missus vulgarity of frilly knickers and bras made of colanders , the ugly , old blokes playing women , the girls in tights playing chaps , the cows and horses , which are evidently two people in a silly costume			1
the whole thing is topsy - turvy and corny , and yet even illustrious thespians like sir @entity31 ca n’t wait to show the public his @entity32			1
i think he played @entity32 before he played @entity34 , which gives you an idea of his priorities			1
deliberately uncool , pantomime expresses our nutty national temperament deliberately uncool , pantomime expresses our nutty national temperament			1
as @entity41 says in this unnecessarily sombre tome , pantomime always revolved around slapstick , gender role reversal and topical allusion			1
the latter is what is lost to us — @entity49 jokes about @entity50 ( the first person to swim the @entity51 ) are on the obscure side now			2
the first thing @entity54 did after her @entity55 in 1839 was visit the pantomime in @entity57 , thus making the entertainment ‘ one of the most popular exhibitions of our metropolis ’ , according to contemporary reports			1
the whole thing is topsy - turvy and corny , and yet even illustrious thespians like sir @entity31 ca n’t wait to show the public his @entity32 later , there would be many command performances at @entity69 , culminating in 1941 when princess @entity70 and princess @entity71 starred in their own production of @entity74 , with the band of the @entity76 providing music			1
@entity78 in the 19th century soon belonged with ‘ cards and carols , turkey and plum pudding , presents and family gatherings ’ in the pantheon of a traditional @entity11			2
@entity86 was besotted by the ‘ poetry , the lights , the music , the smooth , stupendous changes of glittering and brilliant scenery ’			2
there was much boisterous physical action deriving from the circus — brutal horseplay based on @entity98 puppets battering wives and beating babies			2
@entity101 made fun of binge - drinking , gambling and knavery , ‘ holding authority up to ridicule ’ by picking pockets , or pilfering legs of mutton			1
audiences grew hysterical if a policeman had his helmet knocked over his eyes — @entity115 perpetuated all this in his silent movies , and the anarchic links with music hall were to continue with the @entity120 , the @entity121 and the @entity123 team			0
i agree with @entity41 that a clown ’s jokes are based on cruelty			0
i always much prefer the comic dame , a role played by male actors since @entity131			0
the performer is clearly a man dressed as an absurd and ugly woman			0
@entity134 was a genius as @entity32 ; today ’s maestro is former @entity138 actor @entity137 , whose mountainous @entity139 the @entity140 appears this year at the @entity141 , co-starring with @entity13 ’s @entity144 winners @entity142 and @entity145			1
opposite the dame was always the principal boy , played by a lissom lass , ‘ ample - bosomed , small - waisted and with thighs — oh , such thighs ! — thighs that shone and glittered in different - coloured tights ’			1
steady on , professor ! the queen was always the principal boy in @entity69			0
but even as an impressionable child , i remember @entity157 smacking her own rounded limbs with a riding crop and lamenting that she was already 50 miles from @entity160 and still there ’d been ‘ no sign of @entity163 ’ — @entity164 , she meant			0
bawdy innuendo was essential and , in @entity49 days , as today ( unless the politically - correct patrol have put a stop to it ) , everyone liked to see the chorus high - kicking and displaying ‘ amber silk drawers ’ or @entity173 knickers			1
plots have always been based on classical myths , fairytales and legends : @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity164 have long been favourites , allowing ample scope for such stock characters as abominable uncles , misers , barons or bailiffs , wicked stepmothers , bankrupt widows , plus wholesome heroes and princes , who embark on quests or are set tests , winning through by using their wits and strength			0
pantomime always revolved around slapstick , gender role reversal and topical allusion they also utilise supernatural aid , represented by the genie of the lamp or a fairy godmother , roles taken today by the likes of @entity207 or @entity208			1
indeed , tv veterans and movie has - beens often tread the boards at @entity11			1
@entity212 is a @entity213 in @entity214 this season ; @entity216 is usually at large somewhere as captain hook			0
i once saw the elderly @entity220 waving a wand			0
as a child , i saw @entity223 and @entity224 giving their @entity225 , whipping up a storm of booing from the audience			0
i met the latter years later and told him he was a bigger ham than @entity230			0
@entity224 told me that when @entity230 dressed up as @entity11 for a @entity233 party , the tots present screamed with terror — @entity230 played @entity235 as @entity236 playing @entity32 in a pantomime has been a priority for many performers the @entity4 also mastered stage illusion , utilising magic lanterns , kaleidoscopes , gaslight and stained glass to create ‘ elaborate mechanical effects ’			1
@entity74 ’s coach , complete with @entity248 ponies , was always a set - piece , as was @entity179 ’s treasure - cave			1
what audiences particularly applauded were the transformation scenes , when ‘ the glitter of tinselled pasteboard ’ turned swamps or the murk of @entity160 , before the spectators ’ very eyes , into paradise gardens : ‘ vistas of flowers and tall , crystal columns ranged in avenues ’			0
this happens today — i ’ve known buttons and @entity267 nip backstage for a fag break , so that the audience can don 3d specs and watch computerised sea - monsters swimming around in front of their faces			1
@entity78 also utilise supernatural aid , represented by the genie of the lamp or a fairy godmother , roles taken today by the likes of @entity208 in the century before foreign travel , what panto provided on stage was a vision of abroad — fantasy foreign realms , ‘ all the gorgeousness of the @entity290 ’ , which was fast becoming part of @entity288 ’s @entity287			0
it did n’t come cheap			2
a @entity11 panto might cost £ 6,000 ( £ 680,000 in today ’s money ) to mount , though profits of £ 25,000 ( £ 4.5 million today ) could accrue			0
eight hundred people were involved , on stage or behind the scenes , particularly troupes of children , dozens in each show , dancing and playing pixies , elves , squirrels , or monkeys			2
incredible as it may sound , @entity41 says an estimated 10,000 children were employed during the pantomime season in @entity160 and up and down the country			2
until @entity310 in 1879 , no particular thought was given to their welfare			0
such moppets were never educated — indeed , they were maltreated , and the reformer @entity313 thundered against the plight of ‘ pantomime waifs ’ , who suffered ‘ physically and morally for no purpose other than to administer to the pernicious amusement of the populace ’			2
i ’m old enough to remember celebrity dwarves and midgets like @entity323 and @entity324			0
i found them dead creepy , actually , yet in typically fascinating detail , @entity41 says the character of @entity328 was a @entity49 hero , rather than outcast			0
the character would be obliged to fall in a honey pot , be carried off in a bag of gold , be devoured and disgorged by a cow , carried into the air by a crow , swallowed by a giant , found in a salmon , drowned in a punch - bowl , and ended up ‘ at @entity343 ’s court riding on a mouse			2
’ beat that , @entity142 and @entity145 .			0

the whole thing is topsy - turvy and corny
