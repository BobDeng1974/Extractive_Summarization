the first pictures have emerged of a @entity2 bomber lost over @entity3 during the @entity4 after its wreckage was found this summer			1
the @entity7 ( db - 7 ) was loaned to @entity8 under the @entity4 @entity10 programme but it crashed in 1943 en route from @entity12 to the eastern front in @entity14			1
the crew of four is believed to have died when the aircraft hit the ground			2
a hunter in the remote taiga had reported seeing the plane as long ago as 1966 but could not retrace his steps or explain its location			2
this year the reserve 's director @entity34 , 52 , found the plane while on an unrelated research trip			2
one large part of the wreckage is plainly visible from the air on a ridge on @entity42 mountain , which makes it surprising that it was not located sooner , despite the remoteness of its location			2
' remains of the crew were not found , ' the reserve 's spokesman @entity46 told @entity50			2
however , the plane 's identification number @entity51 was visible on its fuselage , which leads to hope that the names of the crew of four who perished in the crash can be identified			1
the @entity7 ( db - 7 ) was loaned to @entity8 under the @entity4 @entity10 programme but it crashed in 1943 en route from @entity12 to the eastern front in @entity14 ' the wreckage was discovered during research on other work			1
it was a chance discovery in the north of the reserve , ' she said			0
the aircraft had ' crashed to pieces with fragments of the plane covering a large area '			1
the plane was one of 3,400 such aircraft supplied by the @entity2 to the @entity75 air force as the @entity76 sought to restrain @entity77			1
one large part of the wreckage is plainly visible from the air on a ridge on @entity42 mountain , which makes it surprising that it was not located sooner , despite the remote location the aircraft was a light - bomber , attack and night - fighter			1
the first planes were built in the 1930s and were one of the first @entity2 aircraft to serve in @entity4 the majority of @entity94 served with the @entity75 , but the @entity2 and @entity95 also used the planes			1
it was known as a relatively easy plane to fly with good handling during takeoff and landing			0
the @entity7 also represented an advance in flight control systems with light handling during high - speed flight ' when the team noticed big fragments of the plane , they said that it was hard to understand how previous expeditions failed to find them , ' said ms @entity46			1
' as they walked towards the big parts of the aircraft , they saw and picked up smaller fragments strewn on the ground			0
' they were surprised to see that the plane 's metal had not lost its shine after so many years of harsh @entity3 weather			0
' the main thing they managed to detect was the plane 's tail number which was @entity126			0
' the reason for the crash is not known			0
there were no hostilities in this part of @entity132 and the most likely explanation is seen as the plane losing its bearings in poor weather as it crossed mountainous terrain			0
no decision has been made yet on what will happen to the aircraft wreck			0
one option is to exhibit some parts in the reserve 's museum			0
during the @entity4 - known as the @entity145 to @entity132 - the @entity75 received more than $ 11 billion worth of military equipment and other supplies from the @entity2			1
the plane was located in july in a pristine and remote mountainous area of @entity28 's 4,129 square kilometre @entity27 wildlife reserve			0
