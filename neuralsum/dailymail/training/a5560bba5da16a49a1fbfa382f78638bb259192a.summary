a friend of @entity2 patient , @entity0 , who saw the sick man the day he was taken into hospital apparently ' vomiting wildly ' has described his family 's ordeal in isolation			1
and , shockingly , three days after @entity10 officials visited him in the family 's apartment , 43 - year - old @entity8 revealed he had not received an order to remain indoors or any advice on how to cope			1
speaking exclusively to @entity15 , mr @entity8 said : ' the @entity10 came on tuesday , the day it was confirmed @entity0 had @entity17			1
they told me that the children should not go to school until 17 october			1
all we can do is pray			0
i can say it is not fair			0
but what is not fair happens ' ' but it was not really confirmed to me that i should stay indoors			2
can you tell me ? ' while mr @entity8 said he does not know - and has not been told what to do - it was revealed on thursday that @entity0 's family have been ordered to stay indoors after violating officials request to do so			1
mr @entity8 , originally from @entity41 , has lived in @entity42 for many years , he said			1
he lives with fiancée @entity43 , 35 , and their four children three boys ages 2 , 4 and 11 and a six - year - old daughter			1
he has been visited by @entity10 officials daily since confirmation of mr @entity0 's infection			1
he said : ' they take our temperature and blood pressure but i do n’t know what is going on			0
they do not tell us what to do for food			2
maybe someone will bring us food			1
or can i use my card to get some if i sanitize it			1
i know @entity17 is in the blood and body fluids			2
' as well as being confused and frightened for his family , mr @entity8 said he did not know what was being done for mr @entity0			1
he said : ' they say the @entity68 is finished			0
so what will happen ? will he remain in hospital without medication for the rest of his life ? ' mr @entity8 only actually met mr @entity0 for the first time when the @entity17 victim arrived in @entity42 last month			1
he appeared fit and healthy , he recalled			0
the men came to know each other through @entity43 's family – mr @entity0 stayed with @entity43 's mother in @entity41 and mr @entity0 's grandmother has provided care for their three youngest children at the now quarantined @entity83			1
isolated : mr @entity8 said that while his children have been told not to go to school under october 17 , he has not been told by the @entity10 to stay indoors and was critical of the confusing advice they have given him and his family horror : mr @entity8 last saw @entity0 , above , on sunday			1
he was lying in bed having been up all night with diarrhea			0
mr @entity8 asked him how he was and @entity0 replied : ' i 'm not okay ' the entire family has been exposed			1
mr @entity0 revealed : ' the last time i saw @entity0 was sunday , the day he went to hospital			1
i had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine , he had been just fine			2
' but that day i passed by on sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and i asked him how he was			2
he said , " i 'm not okay			0
" ' he said he had been having diarrhea all night			0
later they came and took him to the hospital			2
' @entity102 reported that he was seen vomiting wildly as he was strapped to a gurney and taken away			0
@entity17 is only contagious when someone is showing symptoms which can be vague initially – fever , flu - like aches and abdominal pain progressing to vomiting and diarrhea			1
it spreads through close contact with a patient ’s body fluids such as blood , sweat , feces , urine , saliva or semen			0
these fluids must make contact with a cut or scrape , or someone touching their nose , mouth or eyes with contaminated hands or beng splashed providing an entry point for the @entity17			2
mr @entity8 revealed that he learned of mr @entity0 's diagnosis the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the @entity132 home where he works as a nursing assistant			1
' as a matter of fact i was on the phone to them talking about my shift when @entity10 called , ' he said			2
since that visit life has stalled for the family who are left in isolation and uncertainty			2
antibacterial hand wash and wipes sit by the front door of the family 's apartment			2
mr @entity8 and @entity149 repeatedly reapply both to their children 's hands and toys			1
he said : ' it is hard			0
the children are very bored being indoors and all that we watch on tv is the news			2
' in the startling absence of any concrete information the family are left to watch rolling news for updates and to pray			0
orders : while the family of @entity0 ( seen here picking up a food package ) have been told to stay indoors specifically by a judge - mr @entity8 's family have not and are left wondering what they should do they have connected with a pastor in @entity41 who learned of their plight through family members			1
mr @entity8 said : ' we pray every day , every day			1
' guided through psalms and prayers by pastor @entity179 who preached via speakerphone mr @entity8 read aloud to his fiancée and children			1
the passages were filled with images of death , perseverance and suffering			0
' by the sweat of your blood you will eat bread or food until you return to the ground since form it you were taken ... from dust you come and to dust you will return			0
' and ' dogs have surrounded me : a band of evil men has encircled me			0
they have pierced my hands and my feet			0
' and ' yay though i walk through the valley of death i will fear no evil … ' between each passage pastor @entity179 sought to comfort the family in these images of ancient suffering			0
later the family prayed aloud , @entity43 crying out with her hands raised : ' we present our family oh @entity214			0
@entity17 does not belong here			2
@entity17 does now belong in this home			1
' we ask that you destroy @entity17			2
we ask for our children oh @entity218			0
' a tear streaked down her face as she said : ' father there is nowhere for us to go			0
take @entity17 , we send it back to you oh @entity218			2
destroy it in the name of lord @entity226			0
' but as well as their pleas to @entity218 , mr @entity8 had demands of the @entity10 and @entity230			1
@entity231 : a burial team loads the corpse of an @entity17 victim in @entity235 , @entity41 - where @entity0 travelled from precautions : authorities have stressed that @entity17 is not infectious until a person shows symptoms			1
but that 's not stopped concern over the freedom of movement of those who have come in contact with @entity0 he said : ' what is the @entity10 and the @entity230 really doing ? what are they trying to do ? what is the effort – not just here in @entity42 , this is not just here			1
what are they doing ? ' as for his own family he admitted : ' i am concerned			0
all we can do is pray			0
i can say it is not fair			0
but what is not fair happens			0
' i know that some people can contact it and not get it			0
we just pray that everybody will be on that safe side			0

@entity8 , 43 , from @entity268 , last saw @entity17 victim @entity0 on sunday - the day he was taken to hospital

@entity8 said : ' maybe someone will bring us food . or can i use my card to get some if i sanitize it '
