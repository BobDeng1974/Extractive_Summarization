it 's a fashionable way to shed the pounds			0
but following the @entity1 or caveman diet may have another even more important benefit			1
researchers say it could slash the risk of bowel cancer by half			1
followers of the diet shun processed foods – such as takeaways , packaged goods , bread and pasta			1
instead they only eat foods which would have been available to our hunter - gatherer ancestors such as fruit , vegetables , nuts and lean meat			1
however , the latest research is the first to uncover a possible positive knock - on effect on bowel cancer , which kills 16,000 @entity40 a year			1
@entity43 researchers from @entity44 , in @entity41 , studied the dietary habits of 2,301 men and women aged between 30 and 74			1
participants were ranked according to how ‘ @entity50 ’ their diet was			1
they were also tested for a @entity52 eating pattern which allows for moderate consumption of milk , yoghurt , grains and alcohol			0
then the dietary data was set against their medical records			2
in all , 564 developed a colorectal adenoma – a benign tumour which is a precursor to the disease			0
but for women with the most @entity50 regime , the risk of developing the tumour fell by 29 per cent , and those who ate @entity52 diets were 26 per cent less at risk			1
for men , these diets had an even greater effect , with the odds slashed by 51 and 42 per cent respectively			2
actress @entity33 has followed the diet , which encourages people to eat a wide range of fruit and vegetables the study was published in the @entity78			1
scientists have claimed since the 1970s that our bodies are more attuned to a prehistoric diet			2
but the idea became fashionable following the publication of @entity85 by @entity43 nutritionist @entity86 in 2010			0
critics of eating this way say it does n’t take account of how humans have evolved and may leave us undernourished			0
@entity94 dr @entity93 said : ‘ this study shows there ’s a lot of value in the principles of the @entity50 and @entity52 diets			2
ultimately , we live in the 21st century so it ’s impossible for people to live like cavemen			0
‘ so instead of adhering strictly to any one diet , we should weave those good messages into our lifestyles			2
if , for 80 per cent of the time , you can buy fresh , unprocessed food and cook it from scratch , that ’s the best a lot of people can manage			0
’ @entity114 , senior health information officer at @entity115 , said : ‘ we know that a balanced diet with lots of fibre , fruit and vegetables and less red and processed meat helps cut the risk of bowel cancer			1
’ the @entity1 diet has similarities with the @entity127 diet , known the world over for its strict approach to cutting carbs			2
the most important aspect of both programmes is to avoid modern everyday staples such as bread , potatoes , pasta and rice and instead fill up on lots of protein from meat , fish and eggs			0
but while the @entity1 diet also encourages followers to eat a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables , traditionally these are limited on @entity127			0
@entity127 also embraces processed meat such as bacon and dairy products such as cheese and cream , which would never be found on the @entity1 menu			0
however , @entity127 has changed in recent years to incorporate more fruit and veg and less meat following concerns over the diet ’s long - term health risks .			0
