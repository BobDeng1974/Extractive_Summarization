she told the @entity33 , that the ring is made of bronze and has a small box welded to the bezel			0
dr @entity31 said : ' i have no doubts that the hole is there on purpose and the ring was worn on the right hand , because the hole was made in such a way so as to be covered by a finger , so that the poison can be dropped at a moment â€™s notice			1
' ' clearly , it was not worn constantly and would have been put on when necessary			0
' she believes the ring is proof that poison was used in politically - motivated murders in @entity27 but thinks the poison itself would have originated from @entity56 or @entity57 , which had good trading relations with @entity27			1
it is probable the ring was used in a squabble between the ruler of the independent @entity62 of @entity63 called @entity64 and his son @entity65 , in the second half of the 14th century			2

together with @entity107 , an ally , he challenged the @entity110 naval rule of the @entity111			0
however , the principality was taken over by the @entity113 in the early 15th century after the @entity117 , when sultan @entity118 defeated @entity115 and @entity116 forces			0
