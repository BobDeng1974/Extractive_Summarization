a man has claimed he has new pictures of the elusive @entity2 , taken this weekend on the eastern coast of the @entity4 @entity5 , 40 , posted the @entity2 photographs online , which he says his father took on a camera phone this weekend near the @entity9 in @entity10			1
he also suggests that the video could prove an encounter he had with the beast 25 years previously , which neither he nor his family have ever been able to prove			1
he says it was taken near the coast this weekend and shows an ape - like creature he saw 25 years previously mysterious : the hunched , black figure seems to have its hands forward , standing on a log jutting out into a creek accepting the inevitable scepticism that follows claims of seeing the mythic creature , mr @entity5 posted a written commentary describing both encounters , then challenges internet users to prove his pictures are faked			1
the image shows what appears to be a hunched black figure on a log which juts out into a body of water			1
the figure seems to have its hands in front of its body , and to be looking out towards the photographer			2
sceptics have suggested it is just a tree trunk			2
in his written explanation of the encounter , mr @entity5 says his father - who is not named - and a family friend referred to as ' @entity49 ' took the picture on a fishing trip using an aging camera - phone			1
he does not definitively identify the creature as a @entity2 , but says it is ' something that i have never seen or heard before nor again in my life '			0
fresh sighting ? mr @entity5 's video is a new entry in a string of @entity2 sightings , including ( above ) a 1967 film purporting to shot the beast in @entity64 he said : ' my memories and experiences have made me a believer			1
here are the pictures again			0
feel free to pause , copy , zoom , dissect or whatever you need to do to prove this fake			2
i can honestly say that these are the clearest , most ‘ non-blurred ’ images i personally have ever seen			0
' mr @entity5 also refers to a previous encounter in the same spot			2
the precise location is not given , but it is said to be near the northern end of the @entity78 - a network of waterways stretching from @entity81 , @entity10 to the southern tip of @entity83			0
recounting the moment , mr @entity5 writes that he , his father and ' @entity86 ' had a late - night meeting with the ' unknown creature ' 25 years before			1
he claims that while sitting round a campfire he saw ' a set of red eyes ' watching through the bushes			0
his father - believing he was imagining it - handed the 15 - year - old mr @entity5 a shotgun and asked him to flush the creature out			1
when he complied , the creature ' let out the most blood - curdling scream ' , smashed through the woods and plunged into a creek			2
in the morning , he claims , a path of destruction could be seen where the animal is thought to have knocked over trees on its way to safety			0
a map was released in september last year which plots out every reported @entity2 sighting in @entity110 for the last 92 years mr @entity5 's video is the latest contribution to a long string of @entity2 sightings , which have often been written off as fake			1
in 1951 @entity4 @entity116 the footprint of a beast he called a yeti			0
reports of his find prompted a spate of other ' sightings '			0
the @entity124 , an organisation in @entity110 , has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars investigating and researching potential sightings			0
a map produced last year by a phd research candidate recorded 3,313 sightings between 1921 and 2013 , mostly on the western coast of the @entity4 the scientific community is yet to be convinced that they are anything more than hoaxes or mistakes .			0
