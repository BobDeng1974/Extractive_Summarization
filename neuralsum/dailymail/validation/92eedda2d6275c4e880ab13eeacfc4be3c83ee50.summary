' the vet then suggested taking biopsy 's from the top of his head and either side of his jaw			1
the results came back and the left side of the jaw and top of the head were clear , regrettably there is tissue and muscle damage to the right side of the jaw			2
' @entity8 then had a nasal feeding tube placed to allow him to eat but having pulled it out , a vet refused to replace it fearing it was unethical and that he should be put to sleep			1
