@entity1 captain @entity0 believes the growing debate over the size of modern bats is ' absolutely ridiculous ' as the @entity5 considers a clampdown			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity7 suggested earlier this week that lawmakers could look to reduce the size of bats - most significantly their depth - amid fears the balance of the game has shifted too far towards batsmen			1
a host of batting records have fallen in the recent past with @entity20 's @entity19 clubbing the fastest one - day century , from 31 balls , last month while @entity24 opener @entity22 hit a record 264 in november last year			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 believes the growing debate about the size of modern bats is missing the point when rule changes in one day internationals have conspired to boost scoring @entity0 was talking in @entity30 ahead of @entity1 's latest @entity32 warm - up match against the @entity33 @entity0 makes a point to @entity1 coach @entity35 as the team trained at the @entity37 @entity0 , however , thinks those blaming bat sizes are missing the point			1
instead the 28 - year - old believes recent rule changes in the 50 - over format have conspired to boost scoring with the move to allow a maximum of four fielders outside the ring at any point , plus the use of two new balls , more likely factors			1
' i think it is ridiculous , absolutely ridiculous , ' he said			0
' the fact that you can concentrate on the bat size when the rule change has been made so that you bowl with two new balls - the ball is never any older than 25 overs and you have an extra man in the circle			1
' i think that is a point in itself			0
the bat size ( debate ) is ridiculous			2
' at present the length and width of the bats is regulated , but the depth has become the talking point as manufacturers have developed new ways to increase the size of the ' sweet spot '			2
@entity35 leads @entity1 out for a training session at the @entity37 as the @entity32 countdown continues @entity77 is put through his paces as @entity1 tune up for the @entity32 , which starts next weekend last year a report commissioned by the @entity83 - the lawmakers of the game - found the thickness of edges on modern bats had increased 300 per cent and in turn the ' sweet spot ' has grown two - and - a - half times larger			1
those figures have led @entity7 to suggest the laws should at least be reviewed			0
only last july the @entity83 's @entity91 - which features former @entity93 skipper @entity92 - elected not to change the rules regarding bat sizes			0
@entity93 opener @entity96 and @entity33 ' @entity98 are two players who have come into focus for the size of their bats but @entity0 , a batsman himself , has not felt any unfair advantage has been gained			1
' i have n't come across a bat yet where i 've said : ' this is ridiculous , this should be outlawed ' , ' he added			0
@entity0 was speaking in @entity30 , where @entity1 have assembled for the final part of their @entity32 preparations , and was equally bullish when asked to assess his side 's chances of lifting the @entity32 for the first time			1
fast bowler @entity77 receives the ball as he trains ahead of @entity1 's penultimate warm - up with the @entity33 @entity116 heads out to the nets in the bright sunshine of @entity30 as @entity1 prepare for the @entity32 warm - @entity119 9 @entity33 , @entity30 ( 3.30am gmt ) 11 @entity120 , @entity30 ( 3.30am ) @entity32 14 @entity93 , @entity121 ( 3.30am ) 20 @entity122 , @entity123 ( 1am ) 22 @entity124 , @entity125 ( 10pm ) 28 @entity126 , @entity123 ( 10pm ) march 9 @entity127 , @entity128 ( 3.30am ) 13 @entity129 , @entity30 ( 3.30am ) ' we 're here to win the @entity32			1
that 's the bottom line , ' he said			0
' like every other team we 're here to get the best out of ourselves and us at our best we can win this @entity32			2
' it is certainly the most talented squad i 've ever been a part of			0
' @entity1 's @entity32 hopes had been written off by many even before they arrived in @entity93 last month for the tri-series , when they defied expectation to reach the final			1
twice they convincingly beat world champions @entity24 , although any growing belief was tempered with a third successive defeat to @entity93 in last week 's final at the @entity146			0
@entity0 's men relinquished a winning position in @entity149 , just as they had in @entity150 in the previous game , and while the captain knows performances must be turned into wins there is reason to believe they are closing the gap on the top sides			2
' we 're in good shape			0
we 've had a very productive month or so , ' @entity0 added			2
@entity1 's @entity161 bowls in the nets as @entity1 hold a training session in @entity30 ' we have got a lot out of playing against good opposition , particularly the games we 've played against @entity93			2
' we 've covered a lot of bases , probably more so than i thought we would to be in this position			0
' @entity0 concedes one area of minor concern is his own form			2
after hitting a defiant century against @entity93 in the @entity140 opener the left - hander has twice suffered first - ball dismissals and admits he would have liked to have played a match - winning hand			0
' that 's a big emphasis on the team and we 've done that so far , ' he said			0
' i 've not done it yet , which has been disappointing but i think i 'm in a good place and a good head space for where we are at the moment			0
' he will most likely get two more chances to let his bat do the talking with warm - up games against @entity33 and @entity120 at the @entity37 scheduled for later this week before @entity1 head south for their mouth - watering tournament - opener against @entity93 in front of 90,000 fans at the @entity196 on @entity197 .			1
