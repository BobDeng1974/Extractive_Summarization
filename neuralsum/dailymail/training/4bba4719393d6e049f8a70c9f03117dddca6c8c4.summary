by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 18 december 2012 updated : 13:09 est , 31 january 2013 a football - mad four - year - old boy has been refused an operation to enable him to walk and play his favourite sport due to an @entity6 postcode lottery			1
@entity7 suffers from cerebral palsy but a procedure available at a hospital just seven miles away could make a dramatic difference to his life			1
his family have now launched an appeal to raise Â£ 35,000 to pay for the surgery privately after his local @entity6 trust refused to provide funding			1
@entity7 , 4 , with his mother @entity18			0
they live just seven miles from a hospital that performs the surgery @entity21 needs to walk , but @entity6 @entity22 wo n't fund it his parents @entity18 , 26 , and @entity25 , from @entity26 , @entity22 , are angry that his fate has been decided by a postcode lottery in which some primary care trusts provide funding while others do not			1
selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be ' transmitting ' properly are identified and cut			1
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			1
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			1
source : @entity65 full - time mother @entity18 , said : ' i 'm fuming that living so close to the hospital does n't mean that @entity21 will get the surgery			1
' you would think you would have to be in the area to get the surgery			0
' @entity21 suffers from spastic cerebral palsy , meaning muscle tightness in his legs makes it impossible for him to walk unaided and he relies on a specialist frame			1
he needs an operation known as an @entity78 - selective dorsal rhizotomy - which involves cutting the tight muscles and nerve endings in order to loosen the legs and make them more agile			2
@entity84 in @entity22 has carried out 37 of these procedures since they became available in may , but around 20 of these have been funded privately			0
after the operation , patients need months of intensive physiotherapy to strengthen their legs			2
@entity18 added : ' it is his dream - it would be amazing for him to be able to walk on his own , and hopefully the surgery will help prevent him from needing more orthopaedic surgery in the future			2
' neurosurgeon @entity96 , who performs the operation at @entity84 , believes @entity21 is eligible for the treatment			1
unfortunately for @entity100 his local primary care trust - @entity6 @entity22 - does not fund the procedure			0
@entity25 , a plumber , said : ' @entity21 loves football and loves music			2
he knows he ca n't walk and that other children his age can and he knows he has cerebral palsy and about the operation			1
' @entity21 does n't let it hold him back and is the happiest kid i know			2
but because at the moment he crawls , he can not kick a ball unless you hold his hands			0
' fundraising : @entity21 is hoping that next year he will be able to walk unaided and kick a football for the first time later this month , @entity18 and a friend are hoping to raise money by sitting in a bath of porridge while having their hair washed in gravy			1
@entity21 was born prematurely , at just 28 weeks , weighing 2lb 12oz , and after spending the first 11 weeks of his young life in neonatal intensive care , doctors discovered he had developed cerebral palsy due to brain damage he suffered in the womb			1
he suffers from a form of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia , which means he can not stand or walk unaided			1
@entity22 - based charity @entity132 helps local sufferers and their parents cope with the debilitating condition			0
spokeswoman @entity136 said : ' a number of our members are individually fund - raising to get the surgery themselves , because @entity6 wo n't pay for it			2
we will support them with that as much as we can			0
' what they are doing at @entity84 is cutting edge - it 's one of the few places in the country that can perform the surgery			0
' it is ironic that this cutting - edge surgery is based here in @entity22 and yet is not funded locally			0
' the @entity84 in @entity22 is one of just four centres in the @entity155 that perform selective dorsal rhizotomy a spokesperson for @entity6 @entity22 said : ' the @entity158 have been in discussions with @entity160 which is keen to establish a service for @entity78			2
' during the course of these discussions , it became clear that this was a high cost specialist procedure which required regional or national commissioning rather , than locally , to avoid inequitable access to the treatment			0
' the newly formed @entity169 is currently consulting on a draft policy across @entity171 on the provision of @entity173 for children with spasticity secondary to @entity176			0
' donations can be made to @entity21 online through @entity178			2

@entity21 suffers from spastic cerebral palsy , meaning muscle tightness in his legs makes it impossible for him to walk
an operation that cuts the *faulty* nerves in the spine could *improve* his condition
however , his @entity160 has refused to fund it , despite @entity21 only living seven miles from the specialist hospital that performs the surgery
