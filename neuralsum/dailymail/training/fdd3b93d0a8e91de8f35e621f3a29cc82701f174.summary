' i would have said that we have to continue to have some surveillance , ' @entity1 said during an exclusive interview , ' but only under the legitimate authority of the @entity18			1
' he criticized the @entity20 administration and his former congressional colleagues for executing what he called an ' end run ' around the @entity18 , leveraging the controversial @entity24 to do it , and then keeping the result secret from the @entity27 people			2
' we want them to ask why the terrorists want to hurt us , right ? ' he began			0
' and then when they ask , they do n't like the answer they get			0
so they lie about it			0
' ' and then we expect them to be truthful about how we can solve the problem while taking the @entity18 seriously ? why are we surprised when the government hides the ball ? ' @entity1 said that if he were president , he would not ' ask for things in a @entity43 court , ' and would ' only conduct searches when you have probable cause that there 's a crime			1
' asked about the @entity3 's wholesale scraping of data from mobile phone providers and online companies like @entity54 and @entity55 , the former congressman spoke in absolutes , even when presented with an imaginary scenario in which national security adviser @entity58 briefed him on the @entity61 project on the morning after his successful presidential election			1
' if i were president i would have declared that there would have been no probable cause			2
' so , no. it would n't have happened			0
' bittersweet vindication ? @entity1 has been warning for a decade about the rise of the perfect security state , and now he sees his worst fears realized chairman and vice chairman of the @entity72 , sen. @entity75 ( @entity76 ) and sen. @entity77 ( r ) are on the defensive , which is where @entity1 says they should be , having empowered the executive branch with too much power @entity1 said even the construction of the @entity3 's mega-complex in @entity84 , where the agency is reportedly preparing the world 's largest data storage facility , would have come to a halt			1
' if it 's wrong , why continue to spend more money on something that 's wrong , and does n't solve our problem ? i would have stopped it right away , ' he said			2

@entity101 , who worked as a contract employee at the @entity3 , outed himself this weekend as the source for @entity105 's reports on @entity27 intelligence programs he also found it unsurprising that @entity101 , the former @entity3 contractor who leaked information to @entity105 newspaper in @entity112 , contributed a total of $ 500 to his campaign in 2012			1
reason magazine first reported those donations			0
' i would think anyone who 's interested in the government telling the truth would have been paying attention to what i was talking about ' on the campaign trail , he said			2
' but i 'm not sure why it matters that he supported my campaign			2
' and what messages might @entity101 have found appealing ? ' @entity127 is derelict in giving that much power to the government , ' @entity1 said			1
' this is a natural consequence of growing government			0
the more power they have , the less they want to tell us about			0
and , you know , they had the legal authority to do this			0
' @entity1 rep. @entity140 of @entity141 complained over the weekend that the @entity3 was overstepping the bounds described by the @entity24 , of which he was the principal author @entity1 ( r ) got short shrift from major media outlets in 2012 despite staying in the presidential race longer than other @entity1 candidates including former @entity148 sen. @entity147 ( @entity76 ) and former house speaker @entity149 ( 2nd l )			1
he was the only candidate other than @entity151 ( 2nd @entity152 ) to enter the @entity1 convention with pledged delegates asked about @entity141 @entity140 rep. @entity140 's insistence that the @entity24 , which he drafted , does n't justify the @entity3 's widespread general surveillance program , @entity1 scoffed			1
