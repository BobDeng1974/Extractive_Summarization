by @entity0 @entity1 has finally lifted the veil of secrecy from its driverless car			1
the firm allowed reporters to take a trip around @entity1 's hq in @entity9			1
the project 's boss urged people to ' embrace ' the car , which has caused safety concerns			1
mean streets : @entity1 cars have driven about 700,000 accident - free miles ( 1.1 million km ) on motorways in ' autonomous mode '			2
@entity1 has been focusing on city driving for the past year			2
to - do list : @entity1 's @entity34 are retrofitted with lasers , radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations			1
improvements are needed in merging and lane changes , turning right on red and handling bad weather			0
local tests : so far , the tech giant has focused on street driving in @entity45 , @entity46			0
the state , along with , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , have formally opened public streets to testing of self - driving cars			0
the future is ( almost ) here : in 2012 , @entity1 co-founder @entity57 predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years			2
this prediction has not been revised			0
@entity1 , the carmaker : while @entity1 has enough money to invest in making cars , that likelihood is remote			2
industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software , as @entity1 did with its android operating system			1
a fleet of @entity1 's robot cars ferried more than two dozen reporters around @entity45 , @entity46 , on tuesday , in 30 - minute ride - alongs that showcased their ability to automatically and safely navigate around city streets packed with cyclists , pedestrians and traffic signs			1
the demonstrations , along with a morning of press briefings by @entity1 managers developing the technology , marked the company 's most concerted effort to date to provide an up - close look at the cars conceived five years ago in its secretive @entity87			1
the public needs to understand that a self - driving car is ' not something that you need to fear but something you need to embrace , ' said @entity93 , a former @entity95 official who is now director of safety for @entity1 's self - driving car project			1
' we do find that when people experience it , we get remarkable results and responses , ' @entity97 said at the event at the @entity104 , during which @entity1 explained the technology that makes the cars work			1
what @entity1 's car sees : an interior view of a @entity1 self - driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to ' see ' the road			1
@entity1 founders @entity114 and @entity57 tout the driverless car as revolutionary technology that could eventually sharply reduce fatalities on the road			1
‘ you can count on one hand the number of years until people , ordinary people , can experience this , ' company co-founder @entity57 said in 2012			2
he made the remarks at a ceremony where @entity46 governor @entity125 signed legislation legalising the cars on public roads in the state			0
it would be hard to mistake the gold @entity133 450h cars that @entity1 has converted into self - driving prototypes for normal cars , primarily because of the roof - mounted laser sensor that revolves 10 times a second , gathering a 360 - degree view of the car 's @entity141 drivers who spot the self - driving car often swerve in front of it and tap on their brakes , hoping to gauge the @entity1 car 's reaction , according to the two @entity1 staffers in the car 's front seats			1
another favorite involves car drivers waving their hands in the air , in an attempt to get the @entity1 driver - seat staff member to take his or her own hands off the wheel and prove the car is really steering itself			1
' we just laugh at them , ' said one of the @entity1 staff members in the car			2
from the car 's backseat , the ride feels little different from sitting in a taxi			1
the car 's speed , the distance it maintains from the vehicle in front and its handling , for the most part , feel completely ordinary			2
changing lanes occasionally feels sharper than typical , and the car slowed down at a green light at one point until its sensors were able to ' read ' a traffic light that was apparently mounted at an odd @entity1 staff member in the driver 's seat never took control of the car , other than the initial passage through a speed bump - laden parking lot , and once again on arrival			1
@entity194 , @entity195 but it remains to be seen whether it 's ready for widespread use			0
lately , some of @entity1 's ambitious ' moonshot ' projects have stirred unease			2
@entity203 , a postage stamp - sized computer screen that attaches to eyeglass frames and is capable of recording video , has raised privacy concerns			0
for self - driving cars , consumer acceptance and regulation may be as much issues as perfecting the technology			0
sensors including radar and lasers create 3d maps of a self - driving car 's surroundings in real - time , while @entity1 's software sorts objects into four categories			1
these include moving vehicles , pedestrians , cyclists and static objects such as signs , curbs and parked cars			0
initially , the car ’s capabilities were fairly crude			0
a group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person			0
now , the technology can distinguish individuals , according to @entity1 spokeswoman @entity239			2
to deal with cyclists , engineers initially programmed the software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn			0
then they realised that most cyclists do n't use standard gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way			0
a camera peers out from the front grill of @entity1 's self - driving car in @entity45 , @entity46 , as @entity1 revealed exactly how the car works engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 miles ( 16,000 km ) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets , @entity239 said			1
the software projects a cyclist 's likely movements and plots the car 's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens			0
‘ a mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving , with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area , ’ @entity266 wrote			0
before recent breakthroughs , @entity1 had considered mapping all the world 's stop signs			2
now the technology can read stop signs , including those held in the hands of school crossing guards , @entity239 added			0
@entity1 will not say whether it will build its own cars or license the technology to automakers , nor will it provide a firm date for when the cars will be available			0
co-founder @entity57 has said the technology could be available by 2017			0
@entity1 's cars have never ' caused ' an accident in self - driving mode , although they have been involved in a few fender benders , such as an incident in which a @entity1 car stopped at a red light got rear - ended , said @entity266 , the head of @entity1 's self - driving car project			1
unlike human drivers , self - driving cars never get drowsy behind the wheel , and they can react to unforeseen situations much more quickly , he said .			0
