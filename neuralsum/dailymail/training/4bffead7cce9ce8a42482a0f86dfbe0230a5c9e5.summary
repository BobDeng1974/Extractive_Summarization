just three months after winning the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity3 ’s team are already floundering in their @entity7 qualifying group			1
with one win and one draw from their opening three games , the team have recorded the worst start to a qualifying campaign ever from a @entity16 or west @entity16 side			1
even the scrappy victory against @entity18 was hardly anything to cheer about , while defeat to @entity21 and a shock to draw to the @entity23 on tuesday evening have firmly knocked the wind out of @entity16 sails			1
the @entity16 media are already restless			1
@entity27 joked that @entity28 , one of @entity0 ’s next opponents , would be planning for victory			1
@entity31 , meanwhile , were asking : ' how bad is the atmosphere among our @entity4 winners ? '			2
the @entity16 walked off without a word to one another , no trace of the team spirit which earned them so much praise last summer			1
there were , however , no excuses			0
' we can only blame ourselves , ' said @entity60			0
' when you lose the ball so easily at the end of a game , then late goals can happen			0
' goalkeeper @entity66 was visibly upset			0
' it ’s incredibly irritating , ' he said			0
' we pretty much hadthe three points in the bag			0
' in truth , both against @entity21 and @entity38 , @entity0 dominated the play , but were incapable of adding the finishing touch			1
even with injuries to key players such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 this is a team which can boast the attacking qualities of @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
they should be beating @entity38 , and they know it			1
@entity87 , @entity88 and @entity83 reflect on a disappointing night for the world champions there are a whole host of reasons for these @entity94 problems			2
the first , and most significant , is both mental and physical fatigue			0
they 've lacked imagination and concentration in recent games , too			0
dominating by default , they have expected the goals to come naturally , and they have been disappointed			0
the squad is also going through a minor upheaval			0
@entity105 , @entity106 and @entity109 target @entity107 have impressed in their first games for the national team			0
they will establish themselves fully over time , but they are yet to be part of what was rightly recognised as a very tight - knit unit of footballers			1
even some of the members of the @entity4 squad , such as @entity123 , @entity88 and @entity124 , also have very little international playing time under their belts			2
and then there is @entity128			0
it may sound like an easy excuse , but the loss of @entity0 ’s captain is one problem which @entity3 has so far been unable to solve			1
@entity134 describes @entity128 as the player in world football with the highest levels of concentration , and it is that kind of influence which @entity0 have been lacking in recent games			1
it is not just about leadership and experience , but also about @entity128 ’s on field intelligence – his ability to see and pick the gaps in opposing teams			0
@entity3 cut a frustrated figure on the touchline as @entity0 drew with the @entity38 on tuesday @entity16 fans still beleive @entity3 is the man for the job despite the difficult start to the qualifying campaign it does not help that new captain @entity76 is also out injured			1
nonetheless , there were nine @entity4 winners on the pitch against both @entity21 and @entity38 , so it is a fair question which welt newspaper posed , when they asked ' where are the leaders ? ' the question mark sums up the general reaction in @entity0 so far			1
confusion reigns , rather than anger			0
even the @entity16 fans , who are usually quite happy to boo an underachieving national team , were quieter than expected on tuesday			1
they were too shocked , too confused			2
@entity3 won over a lot of critics with his @entity4 win			2
for the moment , @entity0 trusts that he is perfectly capable of turning the situation around , and building a reformed team to become @entity175 champions in 2016			2
any more results like those against @entity21 and @entity38 , however , and the knives may be drawn again .			2

@entity0 are floundering in their @entity7 qualifying campaign
they have tasted victory only once in their opening three matches
@entity36 scored an injury - time equaliser for @entity38 on tuesday night
@entity16 supporters are shocked and confused , but still believe manager @entity3 is the right man to get the country back on track
