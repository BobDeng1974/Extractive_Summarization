hackers have used photos to recreate the fingerprint of a @entity5 politician hackers have already proved they can bypass @entity7 's fingerprint scanner using a collection of household items to make a latex replica print			1
and now , one expert has recreated the fingerprints of @entity5 ’s minister of defence , @entity13 , using just a photo of her			2
the security researcher known as @entity16 , used publicly available software called @entity18 with photos of the finger taken from different angles			1
@entity22 , whose real name is @entity24 , told attendees of the @entity26 ’s ( @entity26 ) 31st annual congress in @entity27 , @entity5 , how he achieved the hack			1
mr @entity24 obtained a high - resolution photograph of the politician ’s thumb using a ‘ standard photo camera ’ during a press conference			2
he also used other ' good quality ' photos of the politician , taken from a variety of angles			0
from these images , he reconstructed an accurate thumbprint using the @entity18 software			0
this software is good enough , according to @entity26 , to fool fingerprint security systems			2
‘ these fingerprints could be used for biometric authentication , ’ it wrote in a blog post			1
hackers have previously demonstrated how easily fingerprints can be stolen from an individual who has touched a shiny surface , such as a smartphone screen , but @entity26 said that with ‘ this knowledge there will be no need to steal objects carrying the fingerprints anymore , ’ meaning that people could potential steal someone 's fingerprint identity from photos posed on social networks , for example			1
@entity22 said : ‘ after this talk , politicians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public			0
’ one expert has recreated the fingerprints of @entity5 ’s minister of defence , @entity13 ( stock image ) , using photos taken at a press conference			1
from these images , he reconstructed an accurate thumbprint using the @entity77 software is good enough to fool fingerprint security systems a security researcher known as @entity16 , used the publicly available software , plus a variety of photos of a finger taken from different angles to replicate the fingerprint			1
@entity22 previously hacked @entity7 's @entity86 fingerprint sensor ( pictured ) just two days after the phone launched in 2013 in september 2013 , hackers from @entity26 used a photograph of a fingerprint on a glass surface , scanned it and then used a laser printer to print it onto a transparent sheet			2
they then poured latex milk or white wood glue into the print pattern created by the toner onto a transparent sheet			0
@entity16 obtained high - resolution photographs of @entity5 ’s minister of defence , @entity13 's thumb , which were taken at a press conference			1
he used the images , which were taken from different angles to reconstruct a fingerprint with a sense of depth			0
to do this , he used publicly available software called @entity18 , demonstrating that anyone with the necessary skills could do the same			1
the copy is good enough to trick fingerprint systems for biometric authentication , he said			1
once the glue had dried , they peeled off the thin latex sheet and pressed it on the scanner of the @entity86 to unlock the handset , which launches two days earlier			0
during the launch , @entity7 claimed the new @entity86 with a fingerprint sensor was ' much more secure than previous fingerprint technology			0
' at the time , @entity22 said : ' as we have said now for more than years , fingerprints should not be used to secure anything			0
' you leave them everywhere , and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints			0
' @entity26 first published the steps taken to bypass fingerprint scanners in 2004 and they claim that it uses everyday household items - meaning anyone can do it			0
in september 2013 , hackers from @entity26 used a photograph of a fingerprint on a glass surface , scanned it and then used a laser printer to print it onto a transparent sheet to make a new print using wood glue			2
this technique relied on a print obtained from a glass surface ( pictured ) whereas the new one only needs photos security expert @entity152 said : ' it ’s worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets			1
' you literally leave them lying around everywhere you go , and they could be picked up by others			0
relying on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security – but you should n’t depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect			0

security researcher known as @entity16 used photos and software called @entity18 to copy the print of a @entity5 politician
*shared* his findings at @entity26 ’s annual meeting in @entity27
fingerprints created could be used for biometric authentication , he said
hackers have already shown prints can be copied from shiny surfaces
new technique has no need for *personal* objects - only photos
