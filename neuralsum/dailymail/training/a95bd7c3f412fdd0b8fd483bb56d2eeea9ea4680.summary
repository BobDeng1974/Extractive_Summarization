by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:35 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 12 october 2012 @entity2 and npower have provoked fury today by announcing an inflation - busting rise in energy bills – even though the price of power has fallen over the past year			1
@entity2 today unveiled a dramatic increase of six per cent on gas and electricity prices while npower raised its prices by up to 9.1 per cent			1
both will come into effect from next month			0
this will see a rise in the average bill for customers of around £ 80			1
the rise will affect millions of households and plunge more people into fuel poverty just as the winter months set in			1
bills , bills , bills : @entity2 is hiking rates by six per cent - increasing the average bill to £ 1,336 @entity28 , director of energy at @entity30 , said : ‘ two price hikes on the same day will just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers – whether justified or not - about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the market			1
‘ people are not convinced that they are getting a fair deal			0
' unless they can be reassured about the relationship between costs , prices and profits , consumer distrust will continue , companies wo n’t get their message across , and the success of the regulator will be questioned			2
' consumers need to see the government and regulator taking big steps to help mitigate the rising cost of energy for customers			0
’ millions of families are already struggling to pay their energy bills amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes for more than 60 years			0
the price rise will lead to renewed claims that energy giants are profiteering			2
the firm ’s parent company @entity64 has already posted profits of £ 1.7billion in the first half of this year			1
@entity69 gas managing director @entity68 defended the company 's price increases , arguing : ' @entity69 ’s @entity73 gas supplies are running out , and @entity2 has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global marketplace			1
' furthermore , the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers ’ homes , and the costs of the government ’s policies for a clean , energy - efficient @entity69 , are all going up			2
' unfortunately , we can not run our business sustainably on lower margins and still make the investments in jobs and future energy sources that @entity69 needs , especially if the country is to grow its way out of recession			0
‘ investments in the infrastructure of @entity69 , in the grid , is what will keep the lights on			0
’ but even though the price of buying electricity on the open market is six per cent lower than it was 12 months ago , all the big six energy firms are all expected to hike their prices before @entity106			1
four other major gas companies – @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 – are all expected to increase rates either before or during winter			1
@entity110 is hiking tariffs by nine per cent at the start of next week			1
only @entity109 has promised not to hike bills until after december 31			1
@entity116 , managing director of small electricity supplier @entity117 , said industry regulator @entity118 had failed to get the market working better			0
' out of touch ' : @entity69 shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change @entity121 said families are already struggling to make ends meet and called for ministers to get to grips with energy bills but @entity121 , @entity128 ’s energy spokesman , said people would not understand why bills had to rise when @entity2 was making so much money			1
‘ hard - pressed families and businesses need much more transparency on costs , pricing and profits to know whether they ’re getting a fair deal , ’ she said			2
‘ unless ministers get to grips with spiralling energy bills , people will rightly think that this government is completely out of touch with families and pensioners struggling to make ends meet			0
’ @entity148 , of the charity @entity149 , said : ‘ reports of price hikes as we head into winter will be leaving many older people feeling extremely anxious about their heating bills			1
' cold homes pose a serious risk to the health of older people , yet a huge number of older people can not afford to heat them properly			0
’ feeling the chill : gas price rises could hit the most vulnerable , including the elderly and poor energy bills have doubled in the past decade and last year each of the big six hiked prices			1
@entity2 pushed them up by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity			1
the firms blame the price hikes on the rising cost of imported gas on international markets			1
however wholesale energy prices are currently £ 51 per megawatt hour , compared with £ 54 per megawatt hour this time last year			2
in the first six months of the year @entity64 posted a 23 per cent rise in operating profits for its domestic heating and power division , making £ 345million before tax			1
' keeping the lights on ' : managing director of @entity2 , @entity68 , defended the company 's price hikes the latest price increase comes just months after chief executive @entity187 received pay and perks of £ 4.1million for last year 's work			1
he was also awarded shares worth an additional £ 5.05million which he could be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company 's performance			2
his perks include a £ 684 discount on his annual energy bill - more than half the amount paid by the average family			1
energy firms hiking prices just before winter is a familiar story , with the prices falling once the cold months are over			2
the falls tend to be much smaller than the rises however			0
@entity205 , director of consumer policy at @entity206 , said @entity2 ’s move was ‘ devastating ' , adding : ' this is a bitter blow for consumers and comes just ahead of winter when the impact on bills will be even more acute			1
' with @entity110 ’s price hike coming into effect next monday and now @entity69 ’s biggest supplier announcing a hike of its own , the writing is on the wall for consumers this winter – energy bills are going skywards			1
' consumers will be very disappointed – the pressure of an extra £ 100 or so on energy bills will leave many buckling and forced to face another winter where they are scared to turn on the heating for fear of the cost			1
' consumers can not afford to sit back			0
there ’s more than £ 300 difference between the cheapest and most expensive energy tariffs on the market – this is like shaving a quarter off your annual bill			1
' given today ’s news , i would urge consumers to switch now to get the benefit on their winter bills			2
' unions and consumer groups angrily attacked @entity2 and called on the government to take urgent action to tackle rising fuel prices			2
unite general secretary @entity243 said : ' with winter approaching , low - waged people will now be terrified about how they are going to find another £ 80			1
' money from the poor is going to the pockets of @entity64 shareholders			0
this is further shameful abuse by out of control , greedy fuel companies , sitting on piles of profit			2
' alongside the government 's punish the poor strategy , millions of households will be forced further and further down the path to poverty			0
it is high time that the government intervened to take back from these grasping companies			0
why is it that when wholesale fuel prices go up , these companies take from customers , yet , when wholesale prices go down , they still take from customers ? ' citizens advice is running a @entity269 from october 22 to 27 to help consumers find ways to cut their fuel bills			0
citizens advice chief executive @entity273 said : ' @entity275 customers will find the possibility of a price rise really frightening			0
' @entity279 increases throw already stretched budgets into turmoil , with people forced to find more ways to scrimp and save			0
but there are things that people can do to save money on their fuel bills			0
' rising prices : graph showing the difference between wholesale and retail gas prices dozens of new gas power stations could be built across @entity69 to help slash long - term energy prices			2
energy secretary @entity295 told @entity296 he will propose a loophole to get around costly climate change targets to stem the ever - soaring price of electricity			2
under mr @entity295 ’s proposals , energy companies would be allowed to dodge new emissions targets because of concerns about the cost of building wind farms and nuclear reactors			0
a sight to increase in @entity69 ? the @entity310 power plant based in the @entity311 , @entity312 his plans would allow energy companies to sidestep having to cut their own carbon footprints - a key goal of environmental groups - if other sectors can instead cut emissions and go green cheaper through advances in technology			1
mr @entity295 told @entity296 : ' let ’s imagine that in 2022 , a new technology comes along which makes it quicker and cheaper to decarbonise in the transport sector than it would in the energy sector			0
' we want to make sure that policies we put in place are flexible , so that the transport sector would take up more of the slack			0
' he said the @entity69 will be forced to still rely on gas in the coming decades , saying : ' i think people need to be rather calmer about this debate			0
' gas in the next few decades is going to play a critical role in our energy and climate change strategy			0
it ’s not gas versus renewables versus nuclear			0
we are going to need them all			0
' the idea of the loophole was criticised by environmental campaigners , who said it could be exploited .			0
