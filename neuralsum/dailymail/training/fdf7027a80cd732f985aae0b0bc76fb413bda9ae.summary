by @entity0 the five - inch darts would fill their troops with dread			1
it meant hundreds of tiny darts were going to drop on them , capable of piercing both helmet and skull			2
now , one such missile - regarded as @entity21 ’s first bomb - has emerged for sale			1
the five - inch darts were dropped in batches of 500 from biplanes flying over enemy trenches to devastating effect			1
they were capable of inflicting horrendous wounds - but upstanding @entity21 pilots viewed their use as underhand and eventually refused to use them			1
@entity31 magazine , @entity30 , noted at the time the @entity33 ’ aversion to using the projectiles , called flechettes			0
one edition stated : ' our aviators think arrow - dropping dirty work - because the enemy can not hear the things coming , and because they make such nasty wounds			2
' also it was not possible to drop them with sufficient accuracy			0
' @entity46 , editor of @entity47 , wrote in a 1915 edition : ' a friend of mine was at the military aerodrome when some of these arrows were being tested , with an unfortunate cow as the enemy			0
' about three arrows struck the cow , and went clean through her into the ground , after which the cow died quite suddenly			0
' the rudimentary devices were superseded by darts with exploding tips and then full - scale bombs			1
just 31 years after the flechettes were first launched from planes on enemy targets , the @entity64 dropped two devastating atomic bombs on @entity69			1
the flechette for sale is among the personal belongings of @entity73 , an engineer stationed in @entity74 with @entity75 12 in 1916			1
known as flechettes , the one for sale is among the personal belongings of @entity73 ( above ) , an engineer stationed in @entity74 with @entity75 12 in 1916 although deadly , they were much sought - after battlefield mementos among troops			1
it is expected to fetch £ 100 when it goes under the hammer at @entity86 auction house in @entity87 , @entity88 , on behalf of relatives of mr @entity73 who live in @entity90 , @entity91			1
@entity92 , auctioneer , said : ' @entity73 was a precision engineer who enlisted voluntarily at the outbreak of war and was involved in the manufacture of flechettes			1
' the flechettes were packed into boxes which had a special release system on it			0
' the flechettes were packed into boxes which had a special release system on it			0
the pilot would fly over enemy trenches and pull a string to release them , 500 at a time , over @entity3 troops			1
but they were n't very accurate and they certainly were n't very @entity21 , ' said auctioneer @entity92			2
above , a @entity21 @entity6 biplane ' the pilot would then fly over enemy trenches and pull a string to release the darts , 500 at a time , over the @entity3 troops below			1
' but they were n’t very accurate and they certainly were n’t very @entity21 - in fact the @entity21 pilots did n’t like using them at all			1
' it was only when the @entity3 began using ungentlemanly methods of warfare that they became more accepted			0
' @entity127 had only just started to be used in warfare and these darts were effectively the precursor to bombs			2
' it ’s incredible to think that in just 30 years it went from dropping rudimentary metal darts to dropping the atom bomb			1
' the auction will take place on july 9			0
at the outbreak of hostilities , warring nations had limited air forces which flew slow and unarmed reconnaissance planes into enemy territory			0
but aerial warfare was quickly developed by both sides , initially with bombs being dropped by hand and pistols being used on occasions			2
machines guns were mounted to the front of planes as well as being fitted to observers ’ platforms on two - seaters and intense battles commenced			0
the @entity3 air force pioneered the use of ‘ flying wings ’ – large numbers of aircraft patrolling into enemy territory together			0
@entity163 , the celebrated ace known as the @entity164 because of the colour of his fokker triplane , led such ‘ flying circuses ’ and became a hero among @entity3 soldiers			0
in @entity21 , the @entity33 , which was the @entity171 ’s flying service and the @entity172 were amalgamated in 1918 to form the @entity173			2
by this stage of the war , advanced planes such as @entity175 were flying as high as 18,000ft achieving speeds of 123mph			0
in october 1918 , the heaviest bomb of the war was dropped by a @entity181 at 1,650lb , an unthinkable weight at the beginning			2
right up until the end of the war , the various nations ’ air forces were evenly matched , suffering similar numbers of losses .			0

one of the ' flechettes ' is expected to reach £ 100 at auction
it belonged to @entity73 , an engineer stationed in @entity74 with @entity75 12 in 1916
