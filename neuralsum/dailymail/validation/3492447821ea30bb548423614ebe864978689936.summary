@entity0 was looking forward to a pre-season trip to the @entity2 when he noticed his passport on the bench beneath his peg in the @entity7 dressing - room			1
he had only just handed it in			2
it was then that he scanned – and rescanned - the squad list for the warm - weather getaway			2
‘ i did n’t know what i ’d done wrong , the manager ( @entity18 ) never said a word to me , ’ the 31 - year - old tells @entity14 as he reflects on the shock of his summer exile			1
@entity0 ( front ) celebrates @entity22 's famous comeback win against @entity23 in the @entity25 fourth round the @entity7 loanee converts the @entity28 ' second goal against @entity29 in the fifth round ‘ i thought , “ what sort of season am i going to have here ? ”			1
it was a surprise because i felt good , but i certainly knew where i stood when i saw my passport			0
‘ they left me behind and went to @entity40			0
i was getting changed in the senior dressing - room by myself every day , it was soul - destroying			2
’ eight months on , however , and it is @entity0 who is flying			1
on saturday lunchtime the @entity22 loanee will bid to extend his remarkable run of having scored in every round of the @entity25 when @entity46 visit @entity47			1
he is one win away from a first appearance at @entity50			0
‘ i never dreamt my season would play out like this , ’ he says			0
‘ i was left to train with the under - 21s but the young lads gave me enthusiasm and it was pleasure to work with them			2
i just went back to basics and worked my socks off			0
@entity0 was left out of the squad for @entity7 's pre-season tour but is now in fine scoring form at @entity22 ‘ after that i just needed that chance to go and play and unleash myself			1
@entity22 has been perfect for me			1
’ his dad is a police detective and has worked in football , including spotting hooligans at the @entity67			0
@entity0 was @entity68 ’s player of the year in 2011 - 12 , despite playing only six hours of football before the end of february			1
he is from @entity71 , the @entity72 village where @entity73 was filmed			0
@entity74 has five goals and three assists in the @entity25 this season			1
only @entity78 ( five goals , four assists ) has been involved in more goals			0
it was in october that @entity74 journeyed north across the @entity83 and joined the @entity28			1
within a few weeks he was scoring the goal which , on reflection , he admits could prove the most important of them all			2
@entity89 ’s side were trailing 1 - 0 at @entity90 in the @entity91 and had barely laid a finger on the @entity94 outfit when @entity0 pounced to level in the second half			1
‘ it ’s incredible to be on this scoring run , but the goal everyone forgets is the one at @entity90 - without that we might not be here now , ’ he says			1
after that came a cool finish in a 4 - 1 victory over @entity107 before a close - range sweep to help dispose of @entity109 during a 4 - 0 triumph on home soil , the prize for which was a trip to @entity23			2
at 3.40pm they trailed 2 - 0 to the @entity115 leaders and odds of 1000/1 were available on a turnaround			2
it was then that @entity0 drilled home from the edge of the area			1
‘ without that i think the game would have drifted away , ’ he says			0
@entity22 won 4 - 2 to set up a home tie against @entity0 ’s former club @entity29 , whose fans once produced a t - shirt mocking the striker ’s 30 - game wait for his first goal			1
the striker now has five goals in the prestigious tournament this term , including this strike against @entity23 @entity74 ( right ) celebrates after beating @entity29 2 - 0 in the fifth round with team - mate @entity137 it was sweet , then , when he fired the tie - clincher during a 2 - 0 victory in front of 4,000 travelling @entity29			1
‘ not only was it a crucial goal but it was nice to prove a point , ’ he says			0
‘ they had their opinion of me , although i always took the t - shirt in good spirit			2
‘ but these things have a habit of biting you on the backside , do n’t they ? ‘ one newspaper were trying to get me to wear the t - shirt underneath my @entity22 top			1
i thought about it but i would have looked stupid had we got beat and i did n’t score			0
’ the goal marked the 100th of @entity0 ’s career			1
billed as the next @entity163 when @entity164 paid hometown @entity7 £ 1.25million 11 years ago , the @entity162 regular never scaled the heights perhaps expected			1
‘ everything had been so good for me at @entity7			1
i had no experience of things going wrong , ’ he recalls			0
‘ it did n’t work out at @entity164 or @entity29 but i did n’t have the knowhow to turn it around			0
@entity0 was mocked for his strike rate at @entity29 ( right ) but proved a point with a goal against his old club ‘ it was n’t until @entity177 in the @entity115 that i rediscovered myself			1
then we had the @entity180 affair and were relegated			0
it just felt like little breaks were going against me			0
‘ but i ’m proud of what i have achieved over 10 years at @entity184			0
the gaffer says i ’m actually getting better – i ’m certainly not getting quicker ! ‘ i think he ’s got a point though			0
i feel i ’m playing at a higher level for longer periods			0
after what happened during the summer i feel like i have a renewed energy for it			0
‘ it ’s good timing , especially with my deal being up in the summer			0
it ’s nice to get my name out there and i have got a lot of football left in me			0
‘ there will be discussions with @entity22 and if i stay that will be fantastic			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , has had to persuade his lucky mascot and four - year - old daughter @entity205 to come to today ’s game rather than a pantomime			1
should her dad score in another @entity22 upset then it will be him taking centre stage in a @entity50 semi-final			2
forget the @entity2 , now that would be the dream ticket			0
@entity0 ’s chosen charity is @entity216			2

@entity0 was exiled by former @entity7 manager @entity18
eight months on the @entity22 striker is the joint - top scorer in the @entity25
@entity0 could extend his run of scoring in every round against @entity46
