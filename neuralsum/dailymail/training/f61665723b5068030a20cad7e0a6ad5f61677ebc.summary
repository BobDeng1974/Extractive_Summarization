@entity0 have inquired about signing @entity2 ’s @entity1			2
@entity3 has said that @entity5 restrictions will make it difficult for the club to sign players this month , but despite this @entity0 are closely monitoring @entity9			1
the £ 10million attacking midfielder was excellent in @entity2 ’s @entity12 games against @entity13 , and @entity0 have been watching him for some time			1
even if a deal is done this month , there is a possibility that @entity1 , whose contract runs out in 2017 , could stay at @entity2 for another season			0
this which would keep him off the @entity0 wage bill and allow him to mature in the process			0
but @entity0 will have to conclude a deal quickly as @entity18 are also keen on the midfielder , who once trialled at @entity13 , and could put him straight into their team .			0
