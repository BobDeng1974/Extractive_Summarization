@entity0 has undergone a boom in self - employment as mothers seek out more flexible careers @entity0 has undergone a boom in self - employment as mothers seek out more flexible careers , the @entity6 claims			1
since 2008 , the number of self - employed workers has risen by almost 700,000 from 3.8million to 4.5million			0
one in seven people in employment now work for themselves , compared to one in eight before the recession			1
the @entity6 said ‘ large numbers ’ of people had chosen to go freelance or set up their own business , in recent years , but the rise was particularly noticeable among women			1
while self - employment among men has remained ‘ roughly flat ’ , more women now work for themselves so they can better juggle childcare , they said			1
a report by the @entity6 noted ‘ growing self - employment among female workers ’ , pushing up the overall rate in the @entity0 ‘ part of this rise could reflect the desire to maintain a work - family balance and flexibility of hours ’ , they said			1
the @entity6 also reported a significant rise in so - called ‘ silver entrepreneurs ’ , as more over 65s remained in the workforce			1
they said : ‘ older workers are more likely to be self - employed than younger workers			0
‘ this is perhaps because they have accumulated more knowledge or experience to start businesses			0
‘ or it could be because they prefer the greater flexibility that self - employment offers			0
growing numbers are now working well into their 70s as @entity0 live for longer			0
the number of older workers increased after the default retirement age was abolished in 2011 , making it illegal for employers to force staff to retire at 65			2
the @entity6 said that around half the increase in self - employment in the last 10 years was associated with ‘ the ageing of the workforce ’			2
improvements in computer technology have made it easier for people to start their own business , the @entity6 said , with entrepreneurs able to sell their goods online instead of the ‘ need for traditional bricks and mortar stores ’			1
previously , critics have suggested the rise in self - employment was because those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis had been unable to find new ones			2
but the @entity6 dismissed this theory and said the increase actually reflected a ‘ longer - term trend ’ in @entity0			2
it said : ‘ while the recession may have pushed some workers into self - employment where they might otherwise have been unemployed , there is little evidence to suggest this was a major factor in the rise of self - employment			2
’ there was also a rise in the number of over 65s who are still in work , according to the figures ( file image ) the @entity96 said the most common part - time self - employed jobs for women were hairdressers and cleaners , which are typically low - paid			1
they claimed that , while many women choose to work part - time , there had been ‘ a marked increase in the number of women moving into part - time jobs since the recession because they could n’t find full - time employment ’			1
shadow business secretary and @entity115 mp @entity114 also claimed self - employed people had been the hardest hit by the cost - of - living crisis and that incomes had fallen			0
the @entity119 and the @entity120 yesterday disputed this bleak picture , however , and welcomed the @entity6 ’s report			0
@entity123 , of @entity124 , said : ‘ with the report categorically stating that the increase in those working for themselves has not happened out of economic necessity , it is hoped the report will sway those , most notably the @entity115 , still clinging to the belief that the rise of self - employment represents increased insecurity in the labour market			0
‘ the report supports the findings of our own research that has repeatedly shown the @entity0 ’s independent professionals to be masters of their own destiny rather than becoming their own boss out of enforced or hidden unemployment			0
‘ the self - employed now constitute almost 15 per cent of the workforce and have been the catalyst for economic growth and recovery in the @entity0 and it is high time they are celebrated for this fact			0

one in seven people who are in employment work for themselves
@entity6 said ' large numbers ' had set up their own businesses
the rise was particularly noticeable among women to juggle childcare
the @entity6 also noted a rise in number of over 65 ' silver entrepreneurs '
