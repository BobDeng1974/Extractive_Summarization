by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 6 december 2012 @entity2 : 08:01 est , 7 december 2012 modern human technology began more than 70,000 years ago in @entity5 before spreading to communities elsewhere , a new study claims			1
it was there that our ancestors made the first bone tools , the first abstract art , the first jewellery and probably the first stone tipped spears and arrows , research shows			2
the claims , based on archaeological findings over the past decade , contradict the widely held belief that modern human behaviour originated in @entity21 about 40,000 years ago			1
the first nerds ? a reconstruction of a @entity24 hunting party from the @entity27 documentary planet of the @entity28			0
new research traces the birth of technology 70,000 years to southern @entity5 they chime with findings published just last month which suggested that the development of long - range weapons in @entity5 was the technological breakthrough which allowed humans to become the dominant species			1
renowned archaeologist professor @entity39 , of @entity40 in @entity5 , author of the new paper , says the most recent research decisively shows that @entity5 is the birthplace of modern human cognition			1
' all of these innovations , plus many others we are just discovering , clearly show that @entity24 in southern @entity5 at that time were cognitively modern and behaving in many ways like ourselves , ' he said			1
' it is a good reason to be proud of our earliest , common ancestors who lived and evolved in @entity5 and who later spread out into the rest of the world after about 60,000 years			1
' the first gadgets : a ) bone point from the @entity57 levels at @entity58			0
b - g ) bone tools from the @entity63 levels at @entity64 ; b - e are bone awls ; f - g are bone points			0
@entity68 ) engraved lines on tools c and g. @entity70 ) engraved bone fragment professor @entity39 's paper is the first detailed summary of research into the @entity63 techno - traditions , dating back 75,000 years , and the @entity78 techno - tradition , which dates back 65,000 years			2
the paper , entitled @entity81 techno - traditions in @entity82 : a review of the @entity63 and @entity78 , c. 75 ka , published online today in the @entity84			0
these were periods of many innovations including , for example , the first abstract art ( engraved ochre and engraved ostrich eggshell ) ; the first jewellery ( shell beads ) ; the first bone tools ; and the earliest use of the pressure flaking technique , that was used in combination with heating to make stone spear points and the first probable use of stone tipped arrows			0
engraved ochres from the @entity105 phase at @entity64 : a ) two groups of incisions , one on the centre and one close to the edge ; in the centre two joining lines form a ' y ' that is crossed by a few perpendicular parallel lines ; three incisions cross these lines			0
b ) two lines that cross perpendicularly on the top right margin ; converging lines produced with a single lithic point			0

@entity141 ) cross-hatched pattern incised on one long edge the research also addresses some of the nagging questions as to what drove our ancestors to develop these innovative technologies			0
the development of ' high tech ' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in @entity5 gave humans the killing edge which helped make us the dominant species , research suggests			1
finds in @entity5 suggest that by the time our ancestors began to spread across the planet they had developed advanced weapons that made them more than a match for @entity162 rivals			2
research on stone tools and @entity162 anatomy strongly suggests that our now - extinct sister species lacked true projectile weapons			0
' when @entity169 left @entity5 and entered @entity162 territory they had projectiles with greater killing reach , and these early moderns probably also had higher levels of pro-social ( hyper - cooperative ) behaviour , ' said @entity176 , project director and @entity178 professor in the @entity179			2
' these two traits were a knockout punch			0
combine them , as modern humans did and still do , and no prey or competitor is safe			2
' this probably laid the foundation for the expansion @entity189 of modern humans and the extinction of many prey as well as our sister species such as @entity162			2
' according to professor @entity39 answers to these questions are , in part , found in demography and climate change , particularly changing sea levels , which were major drivers of innovation and variability in material culture			2
this paper is just the latest to come from @entity206 and others ' research on @entity169 archaeology that has debunked the idea that modern human behaviour originated in @entity21 after about 40,000 years ago			1
there is increasing evidence for an @entity169 origin for behavioural and technological modernity more than 70,000 years ago and that the earliest origin of all @entity24 lies in @entity5 with a special focus in southern @entity5			1
last month @entity218 reported a new study by @entity221 researchers which suggested the development of ' high tech ' long range weapons 71,000 years ago in the region gave humans the killing edge to help make us the dominant species			1
the findings at @entity232 , near @entity233 , included @entity57 technology that only took hold in other areas of @entity5 and in @entity237 about 50,000 years later			1
those researchers noted that the depth of archaeological research in @entity5 was minuscule compared to that which has taken place so far in @entity21 , and because of that it was likely that far more would be learned soon			1
in the new paper , professor @entity39 writes : ' in just the past decade our knowledge of @entity24 behaviour in the @entity57 , and in particular of the @entity63 and @entity78 , has expanded considerably			0
' with the benefit of hindsight we may ironically conclude that the origins of " @entity251 " , the epitome of behavioural modernity in @entity21 , lay after all in @entity5			1

technology found in southern @entity5 predates similar *artefacts* found in @entity21 by *30,000* years
archaeologist claims it decisively shows that @entity5 is the birthplace of modern human cognition
findings debunk widely held belief that modern human behaviour originated in @entity21 40,000 years ago
