a devoted husband has built what could well be @entity3 's smallest chapel in his back garden for his wife who only realised it was n't a shed when he installed the stained glass windows			1
@entity8 , 69 , told his wife @entity9 , 68 , that he needed a proper shed in their garden in @entity12 , @entity13 , with enough space to practise his wood work			1
however , he was actually building a private chapel complete with stained glass windows , antique pews and prayer books			2
@entity8 ( right ) built what could well be @entity3 's smallest chapel in his back garden for his wife @entity9 ( left ) who only realised it was n't a shed when he installed the stained glass windows mr @entity8 has built a private chapel in their back garden in @entity12 , @entity13 , complete with stained glass windows , antique pews and prayer books the couple now hold regular services at the miniature chapel , which seats just 12 worshippers and could be @entity3 's smallest			1
' it was a surprise for @entity9 and at the beginning i just told her i was building a bigger shed , ' said mr @entity8			1
' but the game was up when we started fitting the gothic windows			0
' the couple now hold regular services at the miniature chapel , which seats just 12 worshippers and could be @entity3 's smallest mr @entity8 spent two and a half years perfecting the @entity41 - which measures just 12ft by 8ft mr @entity8 spent two and a half years perfecting the @entity41 - which measures just 12ft by 8ft and did not need planning permission - in his back garden , pretending it was to be a shed with ' space for a radio '			1
instead he was building a replica of their parish place of worship , the @entity50 in @entity51			2
' it was a gift for my wife - i wanted somewhere sacred and special for her , ' he said			0
once the building work was complete , the couple toured the country 's reclamation yards and scrap dealers to source original artefacts for their own private holy place			0
the couple have travelled around the country to find artefacts to fill their chapel , including this bronze statue of @entity67 ( left ) and a stone font ( right ) - which is too large to fit inside the visitors ' book at the chapel , which now hosts regular church services throughout the year this tapestry depicting the @entity74 was discovered by the couple at a market in @entity77 ' as the project progressed , we started travelling around the country to reclamation yards to find appropriate pieces , ' said mr @entity8			1
' finding all the ornaments was the hardest bit			0
' everything in the chapel was previously used in a church and that ’s what makes it special			0
' the centrepiece of the altar is bronze statue of @entity67 they purchased at a reclamation yard in @entity95			1
' we discovered the bronze centrepiece at a reclamation yard in @entity95 , ' said mr @entity8			1
the chapel is named after a ceremony which takes place in the village every @entity103 , when three crosses are placed on the hill where the couple live mr @entity8 says filling the chapel with artefacts was the most difficult part of his task ' never realising the price of solid bronze , we were shocked that he wanted so much for it and so we left it there thinking we ’d be able to find something else for the altar			1
' but in all our travelling around we never found anything that was suited and so we went back to the dealer in @entity95			0
' when we told him what we were doing he was so touched that he knocked lots off the price			0
' he said that a small chapel was where a statue of @entity125 deserved to be			0
' the couple also rescued full - length pews from a church in @entity130 which was having a refurbishment , but had to cut them down to just 3ft by 6ft so they fitted into the tiny building - seating two worshippers apiece			2
a @entity74 tapestry , discovered at a market in @entity77 , hangs on the wall , but the stone font has had to go outside as it is too big to fit			0
the couple also rescued full - length pews from a church in @entity130 which was having a refurbishment , but had to cut them down to just 3ft by 6ft space was also an issue when it came to a church organ			2
mr @entity8 had considered a scaled down instrument , but decided against it as it would have cut the capacity of the chapel by two			1
instead built - in speakers play hymns from a cd player operated by mrs @entity154 at the back of the church			0
mr @entity8 , who owns a number of holiday cottages , says he has no idea about the exact total cost of the project , but believes he has spent no more than £ 10,000 on his miniature place of worship			1
however , he admitted that he probably would not have started the building work if he had known how much it would come to			0
mr @entity8 , who owns a number of holiday cottages , says he has no idea about the exact total cost of the project , but believes he has spent no more than £ 10,000 on his miniature place of worship once the chapel was completed , mr @entity8 invited local clergyman , the reverend @entity172 to see the finished product			1
he was overwhelmed when @entity174 suggested they hold occasional services there , and the vicar now hosts a mid-week service in the chapel four or five times a year , as well as @entity182 and @entity103 services			2
' people are sometimes overwhelmed by their reaction when they enter , ' said mr @entity8 , who described his chapel as ' the most calming place '			2
' at @entity103 there is a procession though the village and we place three crosses on the hill where we live - that ’s why we named it the @entity41			0
' ' it ’s nearly always standing room only			0
