we 're used to seeing incredible satellite images of our planet , revealing everything from rocket fire to deforestation			1
but back in the 1970s , these images looked more like faxed version of an atlas , revealing just how far the technology has come in just 40 years			2
now @entity10 has released the first ever complete shot of the @entity12 , showing the contiguous 48 states , and stitched together from separate images in 1974			2
each of the 595 black and white image were taken at the same altitude of 560 miles ( 900km ) and at the same angle			1
in 1974 , the images were used by map makers , geologists and scientists to better understand changes in land formation considered to be state - of - the - art at the time , each of the 595 black and white image were taken at the same altitude of 560 miles ( 900km ) and at the same angle overall , the map is 10 by 16 feet ( 3 metres by 5 metres ) , and the mosaic is produced at scale where one inch on the image equals a million inches on the ground			1
in 1974 , the images were used by map makers , geologists and scientists to better understand changes in land formation			1
the were taken by the @entity36 satellite , or @entity37 , which was launched on july 23 , 1972 by a @entity39 900 rocket from @entity40 in @entity41			1
the @entity12 as seen by satellites today			0
the incredibly detailed satellite image can help reveal everything from deforestation to erosion an image of the @entity12 in 2012 showing '' the glow of natural and human - built phenomena across the planet in greater detail than ever before ' the @entity52 has provided the longest continuous space - based record of @entity55 's land in existence			1
today , @entity57 is orbiting @entity55 along with the @entity59 satellite in orbit to produces stunning pictures of @entity55 's surface			0
the original @entity37 , dubbed @entity36 satellite , or @entity52 1 , which was launched on july 23 , 1972			1
just two years after the construction of this , @entity37 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 12.4 miles ( 20km ) off the eastern coast of @entity68			2
the satellite carried two wide - band video tape recorders that could store 30 minutes of scanner or camera data , giving it global coverage capability			0
today , @entity57 is orbiting @entity55 along with the @entity59 satellite in orbit to produces stunning pictures of @entity55 's surface			0
@entity57 measures @entity55 's surfaces in the visible , near - infrared , short wave infrared and thermal infrared , with a moderate - resolution of 50ft to 328ft ( 15 to 100 metres )			0
@entity52 7 , meanwhile , is on a mission to refresh the huge global archive of satellite photos , providing up - to - date and cloud - free images			2
it has an average resolution of 100ft to 328ft ( 30 to 100 metres )			0
