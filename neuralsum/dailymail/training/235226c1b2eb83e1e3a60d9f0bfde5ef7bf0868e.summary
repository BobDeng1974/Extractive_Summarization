by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 05:39 est , 17 april 2013 offering tests to men in their late forties could reduce prostate cancer deaths by half , say experts			1
prostate specific antigen ( @entity8 ) screening is used to detect prostate cancer , but remains controversial , because it became widespread long before there was substantial evidence to prove its value			2
it can also be unreliable , giving false positive results which can cause anxiety and result in unnecessary treatment			2
prostate cancer can be a source of anxiety for middle aged and older men until now , the most recent study found that prostate cancer screening reduced deaths by 20 per cent			1
but , with this came a high rates of unnecessary treatment			0
statistics showed that to save one life , nearly 50 cases needed to be treated			2
in 2010 , when the @entity32 in @entity33 last reviewed medical data , it decided that a national screening programme should not be introduced			1
but now @entity37 research , published in the @entity38 , has found that if screening was offered to men aged between 45 and 49 , it would predict nearly half of all cases			1
researchers reviewed a study carried out between 1974 and 1984 involving 21,277 @entity37 men aged between 27 and 52			0
all the men had donated blood samples at the start of the study			0
the researchers used these stored samples to run @entity8 tests			0
research has shown that screening men aged between 45 and 49 for prostate cancer ( pictured ) could save many lives they then checked to see if the @entity8 reading predicted whether or not they developed prostate cancer			1
the researchers then used these results to work out the best age at which men should be screened			2
they found that screening under the age of 45 detected too few deadly cancers			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity70 more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			1
symptoms include a difficulty passing urine , a desire to frequently pass urine or needing to rush to the toilet			0
@entity8 is a protein produced by both normal and cancerous prostate cells but a high level of @entity8 can be a sign of cancer a psa reading higher than four , but less than 10 is usually due to a benign enlarged prostate a reading higher than 10 may also just be a a symptoms of benign prostate disease the higher the level of @entity8 , the more likely it is to be cancer and delaying screening until after age 50 missed too many			1
screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 per cent of the cancers that became deadly			1
in the study , 1,369 of the men had prostate cancer , 241 had advanced disease and 162 died from it			0
the study stated that all men should be offered a @entity8 test in their mid-to - late 40s			0
they advised that those with a high @entity8 reading should return for surveillance , checks and treatment if necessary			0
those with normal results could wait another five to ten years for their next @entity8 test			0
the study said : â€˜ at least half of all men can be identified as being at low risk and probably need no more than three psa tests in a lifetime			0
' ' this is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis , ' they say			0
@entity33 review evidence for screening every three years to ensure that the programmes offered by the @entity121 are based on the most up - to - date information available			2
@entity123 @entity70 said more research efforts should be channelled into finding a better screening test for the disease .			1

almost 50 **%** of deaths can be predicted before age 50
there is no routine screening programme in @entity70
but screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 **%** of the cancers that became deadly
