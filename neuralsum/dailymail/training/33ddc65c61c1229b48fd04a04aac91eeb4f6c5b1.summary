by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson despite @entity2 's new king , @entity1 , being sworn in on thursday after his father @entity3 stepped down last week , the only abdication on the minds of most @entity6 was the one that took place in @entity11 's @entity10 on wednesday night			1
@entity2 's reign is over			2
we have spent six years wondering how they managed it ; on thursday they were wondering how they managed to throw it all away			2
coach @entity19 was confused enough following the game to mistakenly try to board the @entity22 bus			1
predictably he led the early polls asking who was to blame			0
the coach will carry the can and possibly pay with his job			2
he will not be pushed by the @entity6 fa , and has a contract until @entity51 2016 , but @entity25 may decide it is time to walk away			1
the coach was criticised for not doing enough to renew the team that won the @entity54 two years ago ; for not spotting the imminent decline			1
in his defence no - one had done more to bring @entity57 into the fold and few questioned the ' signing ' before the tournament started - only for the @entity62 - born striker to fail to score across 180 minutes			0
horror : @entity31 has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by @entity65 against @entity22 awful : @entity62 - born @entity57 has been a huge disappointment for @entity2 in the first two games referring to his move to @entity69 after the game , @entity57 said : ' my future seems more there ( in @entity74 ) than at @entity75			1
' his new supporters will have been decidedly underwhelmed by his @entity29			1
@entity25 might also have brought in @entity78 striker @entity77 , @entity80 midfielder @entity79 and departing @entity82 goalkeeper @entity81 had they not all been ruled out by injury			0
neither was he done any favours by the draw , with no team more desperate to face @entity2 than 2010 's beaten finalists @entity89			1
' it was good while it lasted ' was the headline yesterday in @entity93 , and many wanted to dwell on the greatest six years in @entity6 football			2
others mourned the fact that two of their all - time greats had come to such undignified endings - @entity96 sat on the bench and @entity31 sat helpless in his six - yard box , conceding seven goals in two matches			1
' we did n't deserve it to end this way , ' said the goalkeeper , while @entity110 , who gave the ball away ahead of the first goal , gave a more brutal assessment when he said : ' we were not able to stay hungry			0
' trouble : @entity114 looked more threatening than @entity57 despite struggling for form in recent years is that a captain 's stance ? @entity31 looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half out on their feet : the @entity6 team looked tired in the second half , and were outrun against @entity22 not everyone was in mourning			1
some celebrated the fact that € 20million in bonuses had been saved			0
that was the planned pay - out for landing a second consecutive @entity29 which enraged many in a country with 25 per cent unemployment			1
in @entity134 , some were cruel enough to greet the final whistle with fire - crackers and car horns on wednesday			0
@entity82 immediately leaked news that they had agreed to sign @entity22 goalkeeper @entity139 for € 12m			0
@entity2 's success had always been tied to @entity82 's and there was always a chance that as @entity82 's star faded so would the national team 's			1
just as @entity82 fell from grace with a resounding thump - beaten 7 - 0 on aggregate two seasons ago by @entity148 ' @entity80 - so did @entity2			2
@entity78 's @entity65 led a small group of players who most @entity6 have decided are blameless			1
it was noted that he was one of the few to applaud @entity2 's 3,000 travelling supporters at the end of the defeat			2
glum : @entity96 ( centre ) could only watch on as his @entity2 side were utterly humiliated at the @entity10 they ca n't believe it ! @entity6 supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson he will take the captain 's armband from @entity31 , who will surely now step down			1
a season spent as @entity78 's @entity170 goalkeeper has taken its toll			2
the miscontrolled back - pass , the feeble punch back into the crowded penalty area and the hopeless scrambling at the feet of @entity176 will be the nightmares he takes home with him			0
@entity181 's time has come			2
optimistic voices were reminding everyone that @entity2 remain @entity184 under 21 champions and that players such as @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity79 have already stepped up			0
there is a basis for a new team , but not one that will go eight years without losing two consecutive matches , as this one had			1
@entity22 's @entity195 was gracious in victory saying : ' nobody has done more than @entity2 for world football			0
' the reality is that in seven days , six years of glory had been washed away			0
there are 10 - year - old boys and girls in @entity2 who have grown up thinking their team winning was written in the rules			0
today they know the truth			0
football 's crown never stays on one head for long			0
six years was a record - breaking reign .			0
