@entity1 passengers rejoice - the no - frills airline is dropping the bugle blast it plays at the end of every flight that arrives on time			1
the flier has given in to people power after holding a vote via @entity10 on whether or not to keep the annoying refrain , whose official name is @entity14 and is used in the army			1

on time : @entity1 plans the bugle noise every time it lands on schedule over the years customers of the @entity27 based carrier have regularly complained , labelling the end of flight bugle call as ' annoying ' or ' cheesy '			1

the move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline 's famously belligerent attitude to criticism			0
huge criticism : @entity1 asked on @entity10 whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time this has included introducing quiet times on flights , with fewer announcements early morning or late night			2

@entity1 spokesman @entity63 said in a statement : ' we asked our followers on @entity10 to vote on whether we should change it			0
' the people have spoken and after hundreds of votes , they 've voted for change , so we 're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon			0
