he won six league titles , three @entity2 and scored more goals for @entity4 in the @entity5 than any player has scored for any club and this week @entity8 has been marking the passing of 20 years since he made his debut			1
@entity12 was picked to start against @entity13 on october 29 1994 , in @entity14 and never looked back scoring 323 goals in the famous white shirt in 741 games			1
he also played 102 times for @entity8 scoring 44 goals			2
the records will eventually tumble			0
his @entity8 milestone has already been passed by @entity23 and @entity24 will surely go beyond his goals tally			2
@entity27 and @entity28 could easily topple his appearances record and the @entity5 landmark of 71 goals is currently being scrapped over by @entity24 and @entity32 but however many records are rubbed out , his legacy will endure			0
sir @entity60 described him as the best player in the world after one masterclass against @entity64 and he took levels of professionalism to new lengths when towards the end of his career at @entity4 the club provided him with a special room in his house that recreated conditions of altitude to help athletes recover more quickly from matches			1
‘ it ’s like sleeping in the mountains in @entity4			2
not everybody who sleeps in the mountains is a great sportsman but it all helps			0
the key is to be the best prepared possible and that is my commitment to the club , ’ he told @entity77 in an exclusive interview in 2009 , coincidentally the last time @entity4 played @entity87 in the @entity5			2
@entity12 finally checked out of @entity4 the season @entity89 turned up but that was not the end of his career			1
@entity12 ( left ) during his @entity4 debut against @entity13 on october 29 in @entity14 in 1994 sir @entity60 described him as the world 's best player after a masterclass against @entity64 many would have opted straight for the lucrative swansong in a money - spinning club in the @entity98 but @entity12 went to ply his trade for two seasons in the @entity101 with @entity42 and he loved every minute of it			1
‘ i know a lot of marathon runners who are at their best when they are close to 40			0
you say to yourself , “ it ’s 42 kilometres and they are 37 or 38 years old ” , but the body can ! what you have to make sure you do n’t lose is your head			0
that is the most important thing , ’ he said of his time at @entity42 that included a @entity5 semi-final back at @entity114			0
above all @entity12 the player was a survivor			2
he made it through 17 years at @entity4 – often the only homegrown player in a sea of @entity120 signings			1
he then survived the rigours of @entity123 football at a time when other players would have had their feet up			0
‘ i am getting so much out of my time here - it ’s just a shame that you would need three or four lives to experience everything you want to in football - in @entity134 or in @entity135			0
it makes the life of a player richer when you throw yourself into these things , ’ he @entity126 in another exclusive interview when at @entity42			0
now as he prepares for a new chapter at @entity141 the story goes on and rightly so this week @entity8 remembers him 20 years after he kicked his first ball in anger at the @entity145			1
