the contempt ruling was delivered by mrs justice @entity32 at the @entity33 in @entity19			1
it is the latest court battle the @entity36 - born businessman has lost after he secured bankruptcy in @entity6 only for it to be overturned and a @entity19 court then to declare him bankrupt			1

potential punishment for contempt of court in @entity6 ranges from fines and seizure of property to a jail sentence			1
in a hard - hitting judgment criticising the @entity66 , mrs @entity64 ruled that @entity2 's evidence was not credible			1
flyabout : the personal helicopter of tycoon @entity2 who declared he could not pay bank loans she said it was ' impossible to accept the evidence of @entity73 that he had no hand , act or part in @entity2 business after april 2011 '			1

he hurried from the court and as he got into a car declared : ' i am not dishonest ' happier days : quinn at the wedding of his daughter @entity99 judge @entity32 warned the @entity66 that , given the seriousness of the contempt case , it would be difficult to persuade her against enforcing action with ' a punitive element as well as coercive '			1
@entity2 senior hurried from the court and as he got into a car declared : ' i am not dishonest			1
' his son and @entity87 were also present for the ruling			1
mrs @entity64 said the bank had faced considerable obstacles , not to say obstruction , and had been opposed at every step as it chased the @entity2 assets			1

' i am satisfied that he was au fait with the arrangements taking place to implement the plan , ' the judge ruled			0
mr @entity127 was found to have offered some evidence that was ' simply unbelievable ' , including when pressed on why he was in @entity130 on august 30 2011			2
business empire : the @entity79 in @entity133 town where @entity2 made his multi-million fortune before his downfall ' as a general overview i have to say that i was not impressed with the manner in which they gave evidence , ' she said			2
' @entity142 was evasive , less than forthright , obstructive , unco - operative and , at times , untruthful			0
' he conveyed the impression of someone reluctant to be in court , to say as little as possible and of someone who simply did not tell the whole truth			2
' he would have said and done anything to keep assets away from the former @entity57 , the judge ruled			0
the bank 's pursuit of assets held by the @entity66 has led to a paper trail and court cases in @entity6 , @entity6 , @entity28 , the @entity27 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
the contempt case was told that , in the @entity157 court battle , misleading affidavits were sworn by the @entity2 family			1

' @entity172 also spoke of the honourable , respectable way in which the businesses comprised in the @entity79 were run			0
' i wish i could say the same about the manner in which the respondents have dealt with the adverse circumstances in which they now find themselves having regard to the collapse of the @entity2 business empire			2
' the dispute between @entity57 and the @entity66 centres on the bank 's attempt to recover 2.8 billion euro ( £ 2.3 billion )			0
' instead of trying to repay the admitted debt due , the @entity2 family , and in particular the respondents , have taken every step possible to make it as difficult as can be to recover any amount due , ' the judge continued			2
she described efforts to hide assets as complex , complicated and costly and said they were done in a blatant , dishonest and deceitful manner			2
' they have consciously misled courts here and elsewhere , ' the judge said			0
' they have sought to deprive @entity57 of the assets which would go some way to discharging an admitted indebtedness			0
' the behaviour of the respondents outlined in evidence before me is as far as removed from the concept of honour and respectability as it is possible to be			0
' in a statement , the @entity24 said it had been frustratingly obstructed in trying to recover the property portfolio			0
@entity210 , the bank 's chief executive , said : ' bringing this contempt motion was a valid and necessary step for @entity24 to take			0
' the proven planned , covert and illicit actions taken by the @entity66 and connected parties have resulted in millions of euros being lost or put at risk			0
