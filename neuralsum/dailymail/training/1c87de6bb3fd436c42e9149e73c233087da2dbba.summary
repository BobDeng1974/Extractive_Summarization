by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 18:45 est , 31 may 2013 bring back the old scrabble : @entity2 from @entity3 is leading a protest against the changes			2
she has spent half an hour every day playing @entity6 for the last five years thousands of silver surfers have joined a boycott of @entity6 after the popular online version of the board game was replaced			1
@entity12 players said that they had built up close friendships around the world as they competed at the game on @entity16			0
some had built up impressive player rankings after dedicating hours to the word game over the past few years			1
but overnight those high scores and contact lists were wiped after the makers of the game enjoyed by 3.5million users replaced it with a new version without warning			1
@entity28 , 72 , from @entity29 in @entity30 said that she has now lost touch with most of the online friends she had made around the world in four years of playing			1
she said : ‘ my daughter knows that i like @entity6 , so when she found the game on @entity16 she encouraged me to join and i signed up just to play			1
‘ i have loyally played it every day since unless i am on holiday or terribly busy			0
i play for about three quarters of an hour to an hour depending on how many games i have on the go			1
‘ i have made friends with people all over the world			1
people were very nice , you start off saying something like “ that was a good word ” and go from there			0
‘ you get to know people			0
one of the people i regularly played with is in @entity53 and when we were there she invited us to visit			0
‘ it saved all your games , so you had a record of all the people you had played and your statistics			0
‘ this game means a lot to people – mostly silver surfers – they had dozens of friends on it			1
but it ’s all been wiped overnight			1
’ mrs @entity28 has joined the chorus of thousands of outraged users angry after @entity6 makers @entity69 changed the online game earlier this week to a different version that does not have the previous data			1
she said : ‘ people are saying how dare they do this ? people are leaving it in droves			0
all the comments are total outrage at the way we have been treated			0
‘ i have a couple of the email addresses of people i played with , but not all			0
these are people i have been talking to for three or four years			2
‘ they have shown complete disregard to the people who have been playing the game for all those years			2
’ game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘ brash ’			1
@entity2 , 54 , a support worker from @entity3 said : ‘ i ’ve been playing for the past five years			2
i ’d play for around an hour of an evening when i come home from work			2
‘ i ’ve met some really interesting people			0
of course they do not substitute friends , but we had a community			2
i ’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people i played with knew that and would ask how it was going			0
classic : the makers of the beloved board game have outraged loyal players who work on building high scores and like to communicate with their opponents popular : online and tablet versions of the game have been popular among ' silver surfers '			2
this @entity116 version allows people to play on - the - go ‘ we have lost all that and all the game records have gone			1
this is @entity6 , people are completely obsessed with their statistics			1
this is not some @entity124 game			0
‘ we used to have a really classy board but now it ’s vulgar			0
it has been totally americanised			0
‘ they ’re waking a sleeping lion by doing this			0
our protest is growing momentum			0
’ @entity133 wrote on the @entity16 page : ‘ it ’s garish and cumbersome ... there is nothing in it for me so it ’s over between us			0
’ @entity139 added : ‘ when i was introduced to @entity6 , i thought it was totally amazing , you were able to play with people all over the world , actually chat whilst game in progress … it was virtually like taking out a real scrabble board and sitting down to a game with a friend			1
‘ now it has been ruined and for what reason ? ’ @entity150 wrote : ‘ i can not see the performance stats of the random players i am up against - i have 6,000 games under my belt , with a high score of 654			0
‘ i like playing tough opponents , i want to see the stats of several people online - and choose who i want to be pitted against ! ‘ i do not want to play some random beginner or somebody who is out to make lewd conversation			1
‘ do not tell me which friends i can invite to scrabble			2
i have played - and thrashed the daylights out of friends			2
i do n’t want to play against friends who take defeat personally			1
’ a spokesman for @entity69 said : ‘ the @entity6 @entity16 game is now managed by a new partner @entity171			1
the benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices , the addition of the @entity177 , the ability to play in six languages , the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad - free			1
‘ as part of the transition , we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics , the timer mode and the manual match - making function			0
' the new version will have the same robust statistics moving forward			2

player rankings based on years of play and contact lists of @entity6 friends wiped overnight
complaints over ' brash ' new design and not being able to choose your opponent
