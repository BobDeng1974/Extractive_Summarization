@entity2 students are forced to dig trenches and clean toilets as punishment , it has been revealed			1
one student at @entity7 , who asked to remain anonymous , said he was forced to help groundsmen dig and fill in a trench while another claimed they had been made to clean toilets at 8am for an hour every day - for six days after breaking rules			1
the draconian measures were revealed as part of an investigation into the punitive system employed by each college at the university			0
fooled : the homeless man is believed to have slept at a @entity21 for six weeks before being kicked out most colleges impose fines for misbehaviour , ranging from loud parties and parking bikes in the wrong place , to skipping supervisions			1
but @entity30 ’s college employs a ' community service ' scheme instead of fines ; the @entity34 can hand out any disciplinary measure it sees fit			0
a spokesman for @entity30 's college said : ' the range of disciplinary measures that can be imposed by the @entity39 ’s is defined in the @entity40			0
' these include making a community service order up to a permitted maximum of hours per term			0
punishment : one student at @entity7 claimed he was forced to dig a trench while another said they had been made to clean the toilets for an hour at 8am for six days ( file pictures ) ' the @entity50 's policy is to make such an order in preference to imposing a fine			1
the college recognises that the effect of a fine varies according to students ' ability to pay it			0
' the claims of trench digging and toilet cleaning were made in the student newspaper @entity62			0
it also revealed student have paid out a total of £ 38,209 in fines for bad behaviour since october 2011 - an average of £ 1,232.54 per college			1
a freedom of information request found @entity72 college had levied the most - more than a quarter of the total fines at £ 12,872 - all of which supplemented college income			1
meanwhile student fines at @entity78 were used to fund a staff coach trip , figures released under the @entity81 revealed			1
@entity72 ( pictured ) levied the most fines upon students			2
it collected £ 12,872 the @entity7 said the annual trip for ‘ bedders , ’ porters and administrative staff is justifiable because it rewards the staff inconvenienced by student misbehaviour			2
a spokesman for @entity78 added : ' most fines are suspended , as a means of encouraging better behaviour in the future and only in the worst cases are they imposed immediately			0
' any fines which are actually collected - and this may vary from nothing to a few hundred pounds in any year - are fed back into the staff social fund			0
' in many cases the staff have been those who have had to deal with the often unpleasant outcome ; the fine is hardly a ' reward ' more a small compensation			0
' the staff fund is used to support an annual outing , designed to improve inter-staff bonding ; however , the far greater part of this cost is covered by their own fundraising events - raffles , cake sales , coffee mornings etc. @entity115 agrees a day 's absence from work to support this aim			0
' one student from the college was fined £ 200 for stealing a candlestick and another student at @entity120 was made to pay £ 600 for smoking cannabis in their room			1
the spokesman added : ' the theft of a silver candlestick from another college was intended to send a very stern message that theft is never condoned , and potentially avoided the individual concerned being reported to the police and ending up with a criminal record which could affect his future job prospects			0
' @entity136 : one student at @entity78 ( pictured ) was fined £ 200 for a stolen candlestick students at @entity140 are charged up to £ 15 for each supervision session they miss. but the figures showed the actual amount varies with £ 43.43 being charged for missing two supervisions and £ 50.32 for missing three			1
students are also fined £ 50 for leaving their bikes unattended in prohibited areas			1
and if there is an act of vandalism on college grounds the entire student body is fined			2
@entity154 ’s college charges students £ 25 per head for every person involved in ' noise disturbance ' while a ' noise violation ' in @entity161 college merits a fine of £ 180			2
@entity161 also fines £ 70 for setting off the fire alarm			2
but a @entity161 student , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ' one of my friends was fined £ 80 for setting off the fire alarm by boiling a kettle			1
@entity161 said they ’d lower the fine if he did n’t contest them			0
' @entity72 £ 12,872 @entity174 £ 9,930 fitzwilliam £ 6,245 @entity175 £ 1,764 @entity140 £ 1,275.25 all fines revealed in the figures at @entity178 arise from leaving rooms in what were perceived to be unacceptable states			2
a spokesman for @entity178 college said : ' students are asked to clean their rooms on departure			2
' if this is not the case , fines ( as set out in @entity188 ) will be imposed			0
' @entity72 charged £ 6,719 for ' housekeeping ' , but it did not state specific charges			0
@entity193 revealed it does not levy fines , but has other means of maintaining discipline			0
a student from the college said : ' i think fining is terrible , as how severely people are affected by the fines will be largely dependent on the economic situation of the student and his / her family , which makes the system of punishment highly unfair			2
' the @entity2 has no overarching policy with regard to fining students as it is at the discretion of individual colleges to enforce behavioural discipline			1
@entity140 ( pictured ) fined students £ 1,275.25 since october 2011			1
in total , @entity2 students have paid out £ 38,209 @entity175 £ 1,205 - split between 5 students for a party @entity120 £ 600 - smoking cannabis in room @entity223 £ 240 - bringing college into disrepute @entity78 £ 200 - stolen candlestick the @entity226 states that the @entity2 ' shall have all the powers of a natural person to acquire , manage , charge , deal with , and dispose of property , both real and personal [ ... ] so that it may exercise any power and may enter into and carry out any kind of transaction without limitation			1
' colleges fine students for missing supervision , leaving their bikes unattended or for having disruptive parties			1
the majority of colleges charge for any damage done to rooms , but as this is a remunerative sum it is therefore classed as a charge rather than a fine			0
at matriculation , a student effectively acknowledges the @entity2 ’s authority to deal with damage to property in any way the @entity2 sees fit .			1
