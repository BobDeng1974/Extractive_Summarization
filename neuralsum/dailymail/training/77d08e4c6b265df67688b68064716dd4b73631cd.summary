by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ in the next few weeks , almost half of the @entity4 ’s clubs will make the journey across the @entity6 , planting their flag into @entity9 soil and reaping the financial rewards of their money - spinning adventures			1
it is , of course , consummate timing			0
the @entity16 proved to be a moment in time for @entity9 soccer , an inflection point , when @entity21 ’s endearing side received the blessing of the @entity23 and attracted hundreds of thousands to stage public screenings			1
as @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 feel the buzz in the coming weeks , the marketing gurus will claim a moment of masterly foresight but surely few could have predicted @entity16 would have such a transformative impact on the standing of soccer in the @entity40 this summer			1
across the pond : man utd are one of many @entity4 clubs currently on tour in the @entity9 living in @entity46 : @entity47 out and about in @entity48 fresh off the plane : @entity50 and @entity51 on their arrival in the @entity9 the signposts of potential have , however , been emerging in recent times			1
viewing figures on @entity60 , the @entity9 channel broadcasting @entity4 football last year , have struck a cord with club executives , with a record 31.5m @entity9 tuning in to watch the coverage last season , more than doubling the audience from the previous campaign			1
research has illustrated that soccer is now the second most popular sport to watch among the kids of the @entity9			2
@entity33 , for example , were taken aback to discover that their 3 - 0 victory over @entity72 was the most watched game on @entity9 tv last season			1
@entity34 featured in two of the top ten matches , including their 3 - 1 victory over @entity78 , indicating that it is not only the big - hitters who are drawing attention			0
the idea that a group of excitable @entity9 youngsters are ditching their baseball and basketball for a peek at @entity89 and @entity90 is peculiar , to say the least , but on this evidence , it is little wonder that both @entity33 and @entity34 have dipped their toes into @entity9 waters this summer			2
for the leading clubs , the attraction is more straightforward			0
home away from home : @entity28 played @entity99 in a friendly at @entity101 in training : @entity103 and @entity104 in action at @entity106 chilled out : @entity107 opts for the flip flop look as he strolls across the pitch during half time at @entity101 the @entity9 market is evolving and they refuse to miss out			1
the @entity9 ownership of @entity26 , with the @entity114 family and @entity28 , with the @entity101 group , clearly has an influence but there is now no disguising the potential across the pond			1
even @entity121 , for so long averse to these long - haul trips , has had to relent , with @entity29 making their first visit to the @entity9 for 25 years			1
when they last visited , less than 10,000 turned out for a match in @entity125			0
it will be a very different story when they line up against @entity128 and the @entity129 on saturday evening			0
@entity26 ’s executive vice-chairman @entity130 has long believed that the @entity9 market has been neglected and they , as a club , have begun to prioritise it as the number one region for growth			1
@entity26 ’s evisceration of @entity139 , a team that won the @entity140 only a few years ago , suggests that the accelerated development of the @entity9 game may have left the football itself trailing in its wake			1
minnows : even smaller clubs like @entity33 have journeyed across to cash in , playing @entity149 acceptance : even @entity121 has relented in journeying to the new market , here with @entity151 at the @entity152 in @entity153 @entity154 : @entity155 at a fans party at the @entity157 in @entity153 @entity158 time : @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 enjoy the view of the city @entity164 has already revealed his anxieties , suggesting that such travelling is not conducive to preparation for a gruelling campaign in @entity170 football			0
this much is common sense and it is the way that many @entity4 managers have always felt			2
one , @entity174 , has placed his foot on the brakes this year , convincing the hierarchy that a trip to @entity179 and matches in @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 will suffice as his players recover from the strain and intensity of a @entity16 in the energy - sapping heat of @entity188			2
if @entity190 are leading the chasing pack by a canter come the turn of the year , we may see a number of @entity4 managers knocking on the doors of their employers and asking to follow @entity174 ’s example			2
@entity199 , however , is the most powerful voice in football , as @entity201 and co may discover			0
for others , it is a game of catch - up			0
@entity27 are still emerging as a global force but the outlook is overwhelmingly positive			2
it will be a sad day when football is judged by the spreadsheet but in the corridors of power , they are were encouraged by the latest financial report that showed the club ’s @entity214 channel received more than double the hits than @entity217 and @entity218 last year and that almost half of the club ’s website views came from abroad			0
now , they are spreading their wings			0
the @entity225 venture , with @entity226 and @entity227 in tow , will attract capacity attendances and similar projects are underway in @entity231 and @entity232			1
new venture : @entity226 has joined new side @entity225 fc first man : alongside @entity227 , who was the first player to sign for the new club the @entity240 market remains vital and we should remember that @entity26 , @entity29 , @entity33 and @entity28 all jetted to the @entity242 or @entity243 last summer			1
@entity33 , in particular , were left reeling by the state of the pitch and facilities when they played in a tournament with @entity78 and @entity30			0
on that day , @entity249 picked up a serious - looking injury and in truth , the bog - bath resembled a flashback to @entity254 in the 1970 ’s , with players were slipping and sliding through pools of standing water			0
one of the attractions of the @entity9 is the abundance of flawless recreational complexes , with leading universities , such as @entity106 , offering accommodation and pristine training pitches			0
this , for the sceptical managers , should offer some comfort but it will only be when management and boardrooms come together in january to organise next year ’s tours when we fully discover where priorities lie .			0

almost half of the @entity4 will journey to the @entity9 this summer
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 among those to travel
@entity277 fast gaining popularity in the country , with the @entity16 receiving record tv figures there
