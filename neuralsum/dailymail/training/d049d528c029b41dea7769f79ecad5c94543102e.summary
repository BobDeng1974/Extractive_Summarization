@entity0 is tackled by @entity18 of @entity19 during the @entity21 third round victory @entity0 was all smiles during the @entity21 clash - which he started @entity0 was replaced after an hour by @entity24 during the @entity21 tie against the @entity27 side @entity29 apps : 3 ( 12 as sub ) @entity31 : 5 @entity21 : 1 goals : 0 @entity33 : 1 goals : 2 @entity35 : 1 ( 1 ) @entity31 : 0 @entity36 : 6 ( 13 ) total goals : 7 but it ’s understood the former @entity13 midfielder wants to honour his contract and move to @entity41 after @entity4 ’s season comes to an end			1
