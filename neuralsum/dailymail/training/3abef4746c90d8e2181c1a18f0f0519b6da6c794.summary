you can never say there is nobody else who could do the job , reasons @entity4 , and cites how @entity6 surprised him in becoming an excellent @entity8 captain , despite not showing leadership potential while in the ranks			2
yet i still maintain there are no viable alternatives right now to succeed @entity15 , which not only raises doubts about the @entity19 ’s succession plan but also begs the question : where have all the captains gone ? there is no question @entity8 want @entity24 to be the next @entity8 captain			1
but they did not expect it to be now , not when he is only 23 with just 19 tests to his name			1
and not when he has captained in only one first - class match , which ended with @entity32 chasing 472 to beat his @entity34 team at @entity36			1
right person , wrong time : @entity24 is too young to be @entity8 captain a huge problem in the otherwise progressive world of central contracts is @entity8 ’s best young players do not receive the leadership experience at county level that traditionally stood them in such good stead with @entity8			1
instead they spend the bulk of their time coming through the age - group and @entity51 system , and now @entity24 finds himself potentially two @entity52 defeats away from becoming @entity8 captain while woefully short of the proper grounding			1
@entity8 are acutely aware of the problem			0
they wanted @entity24 to captain the @entity51 in @entity55 the winter before last , but such was his progress he was fast - tracked into the full @entity8 set - up before then			1
he was in charge when the @entity51 played @entity55 at @entity59 last season but even that avenue of experience is restricted , with the counties reluctant to release players for the second string during the domestic season			0
not too long ago @entity8 appeared to have identified a captain of the future in @entity34 ’s @entity69 and for a while he led the @entity51 with distinction , as well as becoming an impressive captain of the @entity73 county			2
under pressure : @entity8 captain @entity15 after winless streak of 10 test matches video i will not walk away - @entity15 trouble is , @entity69 ’s batting has not progressed as well as his captaincy and it has become clear that while @entity34 are in contention for the championship it does not look as if their skipper will ever be good enough to play at @entity85			1
equally , it has been suggested @entity87 , a successful captain with @entity88 , could be a short - term replacement for @entity15 , but @entity8 do not want to go back to an experienced keeper rather than the exciting @entity91			2
it leaves @entity8 knowing that if the worst happens and @entity15 ’s position really does become untenable over the next three tests they will have little choice other than to throw @entity24 in at the deep end			1
what other options are there ? @entity99 was @entity15 ’s right - hand man but has now gone , while the unofficial vice-captain @entity100 is surely unsuited to higher office , particularly while he can not buy a run himself			0
ask anyone involved in the @entity8 bonding trip a couple of years back — which saw @entity100 make a total hash of his leadership task — whether he really could take on the mantle of captain of his country			0
there is no point either in considering @entity112 or @entity113 because they are out on their feet due to their workload and could not possibly take on the responsibility of the captaincy , too			0
short of options : unofficial vice-captain @entity100 has not shown the right qualities to be skipper there is an intriguing possibility from outside in @entity126 , who looks an instinctive captain , but he would be under enormous pressure from the start if he had to prove himself both as a skipper and @entity52 batsman			0
better to give @entity126 the one - day captaincy if @entity15 has to go at the end of this test series and see how he copes with that first			0
it will not help their predicament now but there is a way the @entity19 could try to create a new generation of potential captains and it comes from a suggestion made to me this week by one of the leading county chairmen			0
he wants it made mandatory for every county to have a captain who is qualified for @entity8 and i would go further and say they should also be under 25 so they have potential to grow into an @entity8 player and captain			2
it would need the co-operation and patience of the counties , but they must remember the health of the domestic game is almost totally dependent on the health of the national side			0
for the sake of @entity8 they should not appoint overseas players or even senior @entity169 ones as their captains in future			0
if each county had a young , @entity169 captain then surely @entity8 will have many more candidates to choose from when , say , @entity24 the @entity8 captain is struggling for runs and is being criticised for his field placings in five years ’ time			1
last word amid all the @entity8 gloom it may have gone unnoticed that @entity181 scored his first century since returning to first - class cricket with @entity183			1
and he had to withstand a spell of short - pitched bowling on wednesday from @entity187 ’s @entity8 paceman @entity186 , too			2
99 ? no , it was a 100 : @entity181 cools down with an ice - cream after scoring 106 it does not matter at this stage whether the 33 - year - old might play for @entity8 again			1
it is simply that , after all he has been through , it is absolutely fantastic to see him back			0
@entity197 still committed as captain			0

@entity24 is the right man but it *'s* the wrong time
the 23 - year - old has only played 19 tests for @entity8
the @entity34 player has captained only one first - class match
