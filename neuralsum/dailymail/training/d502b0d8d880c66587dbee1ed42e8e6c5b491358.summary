artist @entity0 can see 100 times more colours than an average person when most of us look a buttercup , we simply see yellow			1
but one artist sees a whole host of extra colours around the flower 's edge , because she is a tetrachromat and can see 100 times more hues than the average person			1
@entity14 , who lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colourful light , enabling her to see – and paint – the world around her in a different way to most people			1
the average person can see approximately one million colours , whereas tetrachromats have an extra cone class in their eyes for colour vision that dramatically increases their range up to a potential 99 million			1
cones are structures in the eye that are designed to absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit them to the brain			0
most people have three types of cones , but tetrachromats like ms @entity14 have four types			1
while only a handful of human tetrachromats have been identified , it is thought that around two per cent of women may possess the genes to see extra colours			0
the average person has three types of cones , which are tuned to wavelengths of red , green and blue , and tetrachromats ' fourth types can vary			2
it 's thought that the condition is caused by mutations in the x chromosome , which make people to see more or less colour , @entity51 reported			2
these mutations make men more likely to be colour blind and mean that women more likely to be tetrachromats if they have mutations on both x chromosomes			0
the artist , who lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colour , enabling her to see – and paint – the world around her in a different way to most people			1
one of her paintings is shown to make the most of her ability to see more colours , ms @entity14 paints bright , impressionistic pictures of animals and landscapes and also tries to teach other people to see the colours around them in a new way			1
she said : ‘ everyone has the potential to expand their ability to see colours the way i do , but our urban lifestyles and focus on technology is shutting it off			0
i ’m the one here waving the colour flag , teaching people to see the turquoise and greens in the grey rocks and even tap into their own interpretations of the colours that exist			0
’ the average person has three types of cones in their eyes , which are tuned to wavelengths of red , green and blue , but tetrachromats have an extra type to enable them to see 100 times as many colours			1
this magnified image shows cones ( green ) and rods ( yellow ) in the eye , with the outer nuclear layer coloured purple to make the most of her ability to see more colours , ms @entity14 paints bright , impressionistic pictures of animals ( such as this tiger ) and landscapes and also tries to teach other people to see the colours around them in a new way @entity126 is the condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying colour information - which means four different types of cone cells in the eye			1
the average person has three types of cone cells			1
a tetrachromat ’s retina contains four types of higher - intensity light receptors or cone cells with different absorption spectra			1
this means they can may see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human being 's eyesight and may be able to distinguish colours that to a human appear to be identical			0
lots of animals are tetrachromats , including birds , fish , amphibians , reptiles and insects			0
for example , the humble goldfish has cone cells for red , green , blue and ultraviolet light			2
it is thought that it gives animals an advantage when spotting minute dust particles , food and the movements of prey or predators			0
it was only in 2012 that she was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the @entity174			0
experts said that differences in colour perception are hard to detect because they are small and tests are not designed for more than three pigments – blue , red and green			0
based on ms @entity14 ’s genes , they think that her fourth cone absorbs wavelengths that are ‘ reddish - orangey - yellow ’ and are trying to explore whether this is how she sees things			1
they said that her art has allowed her express her unusual vision and show people what it means to be a tetrachromat			0
while scientists are studying the phenomenon to better understand how the brain works , ms @entity14 has a more personal reason as to why she is involved in the research			2
she has a 12 - year - old daughter who is colour blind , likely because of her own genetic mutation			0
ms @entity14 hopes that the more experts understand about tetrachromacy , the more they will understand about visual processing , which could be used to help colour blind people			2
it was only in 2012 that ms @entity14 was found to possess the genotype for tetrachromacy and she has been studied by the @entity174 since , while continuing to paint			2
another one of her works is shown			0

@entity14 , who lives in @entity15 , @entity16 , has more receptors in in her eyes to absorb colour , enabling her to see more colours
average person can see one million colours , whereas she can see 99 million
this is *due* to a genetic condition called @entity126
it 's a condition of possessing four independent channels for conveying colour information - four different types of cone cells in the eye
ms @entity14 paints animals and landscapes to show others what she sees
