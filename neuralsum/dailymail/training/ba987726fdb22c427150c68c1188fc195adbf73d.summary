by @entity0 swathed in yards of pink tulle , with crystal slippers peeping from under her petticoats , my six - year - old daughter is in heaven			2
her eyes are glittering both with excitement and the sparkly eyeshadow that spills like pixie dust on to her cheeks			0
with her dark hair festooned in ringlets and silk flowers , and bathed in the peachy light emanating from a huge crystal chandelier , she looks like a cross between @entity19 and a stick of candyfloss			0
@entity24 's beatific smile breaks only to squeal with pleasure as @entity26 , her ' fairy godmother in - waiting ' , approaches with a tiara			0
' may all your dreams come true , ' she sighs in her tinkly , sing - song voice as she places it , @entity32 - style , upon @entity24 's head			0
' now you are a real princess			2
@entity24 and i are trying out the ultimate in girly grooming at the newly opened @entity47 ' @entity46 on the fourth floor of @entity38 , @entity49			1
parents will recognise the name of the boutique from the song sung by the @entity54 in the @entity47 film of @entity19 , but all connections to ordinary family experiences end there			1
for an eye - watering £ 1,000 , little girls are treated to an hour of preening that would seem over the top for @entity64			1
they are also given an obscenely large goody bag including all the @entity47 princess dolls , a luxury travel case and a party dress guaranteed to make them the envy of the school party scene for as long as it fits			1
princess @entity24 when off regal duty the princess makeover has attracted a steady stream of young ladies , said to include a real princess or two , since it was launched before @entity80 - though @entity38 and @entity47 wo n't name names			1
one of the fairy godmothers in waiting explained it thus : ' the sum of £ 1,000 means nothing to lots of people who come to @entity38			1
' surveying the opulence , i see her point			0
just a browse through the children 's clothing department during the sales demonstrates how much wealthy parents are prepared to spend on their children : @entity101 shoes for £ 287 , sparkly tights for pre-schoolers , reduced from £ 80 to £ 40			1
i watch opened - mouthed as @entity24 falls into a quasi-swoon of girlie bliss			2
what has happened to my tomboy daughter ? she is absolutely loving this			0
five packages are on offer , costing £ 100 right up to the £ 1,000 @entity109 , which includes the full makeover , framed photo , glittery shoes , tiara and dress			1
from the moment you arrive at reception , complete with stained glass windows , your girl becomes the centre of the universe			0
she is greeted by her own fairy - godmother in waiting - in this case , @entity26 - who hovers at the doors of the mock ' castle ' before whisking her inside			0
we walk through a corridor designed to look like the walls of a medieval fortress , pausing to stop at the @entity131			0
this reveals the curvaceous form of the @entity54 herself , who tells @entity24 to not just look like a princess but act like one , too			2
and then , a few magic words later , we are ushered into the pink and gold boutique itself			2
i note with a raised eyebrow that there are crystals inlaid into the floor			0
after slipping into her truly amazing pink dress , @entity24 clambers up on her blue and gold high seat next to seven - year - old @entity149			0
like me , @entity149 ’s mother , @entity150 , 32 , a health and fitness specialist from @entity152 in @entity153 , has come with her husband , @entity154 , 39 , to watch her daughter be transformed into a princess			2
@entity149 is @entity150 's only daughter and she wants to spoil her while she can			0
' it 's great to give them the chance to become a princess while they 're young enough to enjoy it			1
' @entity163 , an accountant from @entity164 and mother of @entity166 , four , waited two weeks for her appointment			0
' i think £ 200 to £ 500 is reasonable to spend on a child - £ 1,000 does seem a lot but if you can afford it , why not ? ' she says			1
and it seems there is no shortage of parents who can - although , in fairness , the ' budget ' end seems very popular , too			2
no expense spared : the @entity38 boutique offers experiences from £ 100 to £ 1,000 i spy a three - year - old having the £ 100 experience			1
luckily , she is too young to care that she only gets a t - shirt and a tutu			2
i ca n't help thinking children should n't be exposed to an adult pecking order within their fantasy world i suddenly worry that @entity47 's magic is placing unfair pressure on parents to let children live out their dreams , even if it means spending money they do n't have			1
while @entity24 is loving being top of the princess tree , it makes me uncomfortable : i ca n't help thinking children should n't be exposed to an adult pecking order within their fantasy world			1
when i try to discuss this subject with one of the fairy godmothers - in - waiting , i 'm met with a blank stare			0
they never step out of their carefully rehearsed roles			0
@entity26 keeps breaking into song and spinning around the room as piped @entity47 film music fills the air			1
@entity24 , meanwhile , treats this as nothing more than her due : i swear if the furniture started dancing and singing , she would n't bat an eye			2
everyone calls her your highness and hangs on her every word			0
during her makeover , she is very sure of what she wants : princess pink nail polish and , to my dismay , the gaudiest face paint imaginable			1
inspiration : children can get their own fairy godmother for the day - if their parents can afford it at the end of the experience , i have to admit @entity24 does look amazing and i ca n't stop a smile of pride crossing my face			1
she nods regally as @entity26 asks her to confirm her royal oath - to be kind and gentle , loyal and trustworthy			0
then comes the best bit - @entity24 making her grand exit down the @entity237 escalator and through the @entity238 , with the elan of a teeny @entity240			0
the throng of shoppers parts like the @entity243 , and there is even a ripple of applause as she passes the shellfish counter			0
how on @entity249 do you tell your daughter that she is n't really a princess when she decides she does n't want to tidy her room any more ? all eyes are upon her for those few minutes as she makes her royal progress to @entity255			1
not even the ranks of @entity258 supercars can outshine her as she steps into a taxi , aided by a charmed @entity38 concierge			1
i ca n't help thinking the ' once in a lifetime experience ' could be setting me up for a lifetime of trouble			1
how on @entity249 do you tell your daughter that she is n't really a princess when she decides she does n't want to tidy her room any more ? and can it ever be right to blow the price of a small second - hand car on a few moments of happiness for a child ? will she now be disappointed with the treats we can usually afford , such as trips to the zoo ? i would love to tell you @entity24 lived up to all the solemn promises she made when she was crowned atop her velvet throne			1
but no. when i gently suggested she share some of her treasures with her cousins , explaining she had no need for 11 princess dolls , she stamped her foot at the idea			2
but then , perhaps even real princesses are allowed to have tantrums sometimes .			0

@entity47 ' @entity46 ' boutique has opened at @entity38
for £ 1,000 , little girls are treated to an hour of preening
the princess makeover has attracted a steady stream of young ladies
but is it right to spend so much on a few moments of happiness ?
and what of the children whose parents ca n't afford it ?
