the team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on wednesday night			2
@entity4 beat @entity5 , to nobody ’s great surprise , and look on course for their best @entity10 finish yet – a year after their last			1
@entity11 really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this			1
manager of the year ? quite possibly			0
@entity11 looks on with a smile as his @entity4 side cruise to a 2 - 0 win over @entity5 on wednesday he has signed with remarkable shrewdness , shaped his players into a cohesive style , and overcome the set - backs of regular injuries to key players to guide @entity4 to 42 points after 28 games			1
his team registered 50 @entity10 points in reaching ninth last term , two club records , but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher			1
seven wins from 11 in the league have seen @entity4 nudge past @entity36 and @entity37 – both clubs with claims to good seasons			1
and all the while forking out less cash on recruits than @entity44			0
that is the bit to amaze			0
@entity11 has committed £ 1.2million on bringing in new players this season : £ 800,000 on brilliant @entity48 from @entity49 , and £ 400,000 on young centre - back @entity50 from @entity52 side @entity51			1
@entity53 , scorer against @entity5 to take his tally to seven @entity10 goals ? free from @entity56			1
@entity57 ( centre ) congratulates @entity53 after he scored @entity4 's second goal on wednesday @entity60 , a regular at right - back with 22 @entity10 games ? free from @entity63			1
@entity64 , who has been adept when called upon , also cost nothing after leaving @entity66			0
@entity67 , whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the @entity70 on wednesday , is on loan from @entity72			0
@entity73 , who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect , is on loan from @entity78 with view to permanent move this summer			2
by contrast @entity44 , hardly the most lavish of spenders , have parted with around £ 8m on transfer fees			2
@entity84 was one of @entity86 ’s purchases , at £ 1.5m , from @entity4			1
@entity4 also sold @entity87 to @entity88 and @entity89 to @entity90 for a combined cost of £ 2m – so in all are around £ 2.3m up on net transfer spend			1
no wonder @entity11 is being rewarded with a new three - year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days			1
his connections , influence , and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns			0
the acquisition of @entity48 , once the rising star of @entity49 , was smoothed by @entity11 ’s association with the @entity105 giants			2
the player ’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury , after initial struggles , a testament to @entity11 ’s motivational skills			2
@entity48 hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury clearly the support network from chairman @entity117 , a @entity4 fan since a boy and generous benefactor , and chief executive @entity121 enables @entity11 to work to his full potential			1
the foundations laid by @entity124 in getting @entity4 up from the @entity125 seven years ago and stabilising the club as a @entity10 presence will never be forgotten			1
but @entity11 has built on that , altering the side ’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made @entity124 ’s reign so successful			2
the four forwards in his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system are interchangeable , with @entity67 , @entity53 , @entity48 , @entity57 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 forming various combinations throughout the campaign			1
no shining lights as such , they offer a mixture of pace , nimble dexterity , and brawn			0
again the cost is worth noting			0
@entity137 was £ 2m from @entity149 , @entity138 a free from @entity150			0
@entity11 ’s other signings since taking charge have been @entity153 , £ 3m from @entity154 , @entity155 , free from @entity49 , and @entity156 , a swap with @entity158 with @entity159 heading the other way			1
@entity72 loanee @entity67 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity4 's opener against @entity5 @entity11 has spent £ 6.2m in four transfer windows and improved			1
in this climate that is phenomenal			0
equivalent to one 10th of @entity164 , let ’s say			0
@entity4 are not averse to opening the wallet			2
a £ 10m package for @entity168 was put together in january before the @entity169 forward elected for @entity170			0
but when @entity4 have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge			2
@entity48 has been out since late january after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until september			0
@entity156 has been out the entire campaign with the same injury			0
captain @entity177 has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet			0
@entity67 missed two months with a thigh problem , @entity179 was sidelined for five weeks			0
now @entity138 is out with that gashed leg			0
@entity11 has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at @entity184 there have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods			1
@entity11 has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope			2
when @entity155 and @entity192 were injured at the same time as @entity177 last month it looked foolhardy to have sent @entity193 out on loan to @entity195			0
but @entity4 adjusted and came through			2
after his disastrous spell at @entity184 , it appeared @entity11 ’s stock had fallen below @entity10 level			1
@entity117 had faith and is being rewarded			0
up next is a trip to face @entity203 and @entity204 on march 14			0
last year ’ s @entity10 manager of the year and former @entity4 boss versus his successor in both respects ? victory for @entity11 would only strengthen that argument .			1

@entity4 beat @entity5 2 - 0 to move up to eighth in the @entity10
@entity4 on course to better their highest ever @entity10 finish ( 9th )
@entity4 spent just £ 1.2m on players last summer , less than any other club
@entity11 in contention to be named @entity220
