his masterpieces have been the subject of @entity53 - worthy photography whenever foreign dignitaries visit the @entity1 for @entity55 , but @entity6 's policies of encouraging ' food literacy ' apparently denied his craft most - favored - nation status			1
@entity3 has even pared back on baking breakfast doughnuts , sometimes replacing them with smoothies made from apples , kale , spinach and ginger			1
the @entity18 reported tuesday that when the @entity8 moved in , he was instructed to make fewer indulgent treats , produce them in smaller portions , and serve them less often to the first family			1

' @entity86 sampler ? for a @entity55 honoring @entity88 president @entity87 , @entity3 made not lady fingers but @entity91 maple syrup fudge , lavender shortbread cookies and cotton candy dusted with orange zest tiny cookies : mrs. @entity6 has pushed for smaller dessert portions during official @entity4 dinner events but the 20 percent solution wo n't cut it anymore			1
mrs. @entity6 said in a statement that she is ' grateful to him for his outstanding work , not just as the @entity4 pastry chef , producing the most delectable creations for everything from birthday celebrations to state visits , but also as a key partner helping us get the @entity4 kitchen garden off the ground and building a healthier future for our next generation			0
' the ' @entity115 ' initiative has urged parents to give healthier habits to their children -- including changes in eating -- but more than 1 million schoolchildren have stopped buying school lunches since her directives changed what lunch ladies serve nationwide some of her activism has rubbed off on @entity126			0
he 's moving back to @entity39 in june to be with his husband and start educating children and adults about eating better – a mostly losing battle , as nanny - state mayor @entity132 found out during his years in @entity134			1
during a public forum on @entity136 in november , he hinted that the president is more fond of pie crusts than with what 's inside			0
' well , i do n't want to reveal too much about the president 's tastes or speculate about them , ' he said			0
' but , really , my impression is if you just served the crust , he 'd be ok			0
' yosses contributed to an article in the book desserts for dummies titled ' how to salvage a dessert disaster , ' writing about some of the ' cosmetic surgery ' that he 's had to perform over the years when his creations flopped in the kitchen			0

' if parts of the edge of your pie fall off , ' use jam to glue the broken pieces back on			0
