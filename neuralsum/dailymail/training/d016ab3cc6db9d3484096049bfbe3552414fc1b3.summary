by @entity1 reporter published : 09:20 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 09:20 est , 28 july 2013 it has become an iconic image of @entity5 's fighting spirit and an emblem of hope			2
yet the immortal photograph of three @entity10 firefighters raising the @entity5 flag at @entity12 after the september 11 attacks was nearly left out of the @entity14 because staff thought it was too ' rah - rah ' @entity5			1
creative director @entity17 was among staffers who believed the @entity20 photo - which has been compared to the @entity22 image - was too kitsch , according to @entity25 's new book battle for @entity12			1
@entity20 's iconic post-september 11 photo has become an emblem of hope ' i really believe that the way @entity5 will look best , the way we can really do best , is to not be @entity5 so vigilantly and so vehemently , ' @entity17 said , according to @entity25 's book			2
the @entity34 reports chief curator @entity35 offered a compromise - that the @entity20 shot be ' minimized ' in favor of three different photos of the flag - raising scene at three different angles			1
@entity17 , @entity14 creative director , initially agreed with some staffers that the iconic @entity12 image was too ' rah rah ' @entity5 to be included in exhibition @entity35 believed it could be valuable to show the event from ' multiple points of view , like the attacks more broadly '			1
' several images undercut the myth of ‘ one iconic moment , ' @entity35 said , according to the book			0
' @entity17 did n’t like three photographs more than he liked one , but he went along with it			0
' @entity17 later told the @entity34 that reducing the historical event to one picture was too simplistic			0
' my concern , as it always was , is that we not reduce [ 9/11 ] down to something that was too simple , and in its simplicity would actually distort the complexity of the event , the meaning of the event , ' he said			2
@entity20 's moving image , first published by @entity69 the day after the attacks , has become an enduring emblem of hope for @entity5			0
it is considered one of the most widely reproduced images , printed on 255 million ' heroes ' postage stamps which has raised over $ 10 million to help 9/11 families and rescue workers			0
