@entity1 's @entity0 was frequently battered by hurricanes as damaging as @entity3 at a time when @entity5 was going through the @entity6			1
this is according to sediments found beneath @entity9 in @entity10 which suggests that between the years 250 and 1150 more than 20 huge storms hit the area			1

@entity1 's @entity0 was frequently battered by hurricanes as damaging as @entity3 during a time when @entity5 was going through the @entity6 , according to a new report			1
in this image waves crashed ashore in @entity22 , @entity10 , during a 1938 hurricane ' these records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we 've seen in the last few hundred years , ' said @entity28 , a scientist at the @entity29 in @entity10 , who led the research			1
the prehistoric hurricanes were likely category three storms , such as @entity3 , or category 4 storms , like @entity35 , that would be catastrophic if they hit the region today			1
the study is the first to find evidence of historically unprecedented hurricane activity along the northern @entity0 of the @entity1			1
the most powerful storm to hit @entity42 in recent times was @entity44 in 1991 , a category 2 storm that was one of the costliest in @entity48 history			0

the light - coloured shows evidence of an intense past storm			0
pictured on the right is an aerial image of @entity55 , @entity56 , following @entity3 in 2005 storms of that intensity have only reached the region three times since the 1600s , according to professor @entity28			0
the intense prehistoric hurricanes were fuelled in part by warmer sea surface temperatures in the @entity16 than have been the norm off the @entity1 @entity0 over the last few hundred years			1
however , as ocean temperatures have slowly inched upward in recent decades , tropical @entity16 sea surface temperatures have surpassed the warmth of prehistoric levels -- and are expected to warm more over the next century as the climate heats up , professor @entity28 said			1
' we hope this study broadens our sense of what is possible and what we should expect in a warmer climate , ' he added			2
scientists believe a change in sea surface temperatures in the western @entity16 caused the historic storms — and they say climate change could cause such storms to return			1
pictured is a satellite view of @entity85 as it threatens the @entity1 @entity0 in 2010 the research is based on sediments found beneath @entity9 in @entity88 which suggests that , between the years 250 and 1150 , more than 20 huge storms hit the area			1
' we may need to begin planning for a category three hurricane landfall every decade or so rather than every 100 or 200 years			0
' the risk may be much greater than we anticipated			0
' the team looked at sediment deposits from @entity9 near @entity88 on @entity42 the pond is separated from the ocean by a 4.3 to 5.9 ft ( 1.3 to 1.8 metres ) high sand barrier			2
over hundreds of years , strong hurricanes have deposited sediment over the barrier and into the pond where it has remained undisturbed			0
the researchers extracted 30ft ( 9 metre ) deep sediment cores , which they then analysed in a laboratory			0
similar to reading a tree ring to tell the age of a tree and the climate conditions that existed in a given year , scientists can read a sediment core to determine when intense hurricanes occurred			2
they found evidence of 32 prehistoric hurricanes , along with the remains of three documented storms that occurred in 1991 , 1675 and 1635			2
the sediments showed that there were two periods of intense hurricane activity on @entity42 -- from 150 to 1150 , and 1400 to 1675			1
droughts in the @entity1 @entity123 and @entity124 during the last half of this century could be drier and longer than drought conditions seen in those regions in the last 1,000 years			2
this is according to a @entity130 study which combined projections from climate models , to find human - produced greenhouse gas emissions drives up the risk of severe droughts in these regions			2
natural droughts , like the 1930s @entity138 , and the current drought in the @entity123 have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less , said @entity140 , a @entity130 climate scientist			0
' what these results are saying is we 're going to get a drought similar to those events , but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years , ' he said			0
according to @entity140 , the current likelihood of a megadrought , a drought lasting more than three decades , is 12 percent			0
if greenhouse gas emissions stop increasing in the mid- 21st century , @entity130 projects the likelihood of megadrought to reach more than 60 per cent			0
however , if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase along current trajectories throughout the 21st century , there is an 80 per cent likelihood of a decades - long megadrought in the @entity123 and @entity124 between the years 2050 and 2099			0
in this image , scientists collect a sediment core ; the sediment shows intense storms going back 2,000 year the earlier period of powerful hurricane activity matched previous studies that found evidence of hurricanes during the same period in more southerly areas of the western @entity16 basin - from the @entity170 to the @entity171			1
powerful storms also battered more southerly @entity1 coasts these early storms were more frequent , and in some cases were likely more intense , than the most severe hurricanes @entity42 has seen in historical times , including @entity44 in 1991 and a 1635 hurricane that generated a 20 - foot storm surge , according to @entity28			1
the hurricane activity continued in the @entity170 and @entity181 until 1400 , although there was a lull during this time in @entity48			0
a shift in hurricane activity in the @entity16 occurred around 1400 , when activity picked up from the @entity187 to @entity48 , until about 1675			2
' these records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we 've seen in the last few hundred years , ' said @entity28 , a scientist at the @entity29 in @entity10 , who led the research			2

this is according to study of sediments found @entity9 , @entity10
they reveal the @entity1 @entity0 was hit by huge storms from 250 to 1150
they were caused by change in sea surface temperatures in the @entity16
climate change could cause such intense and frequent storms to return
