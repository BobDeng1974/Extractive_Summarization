by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 02:24 est , 14 august 2013 professor @entity1 said locking up thieves and fraudsters and ' condemning ' them to prison was an ' abuse of state power ' serial thieves , pickpockets and fraudsters should never be jailed , a former @entity11 sentencing adviser declared last night			1
professor @entity1 claimed even repeat offenders with dozens of convictions should be spared the ‘ pain ’ of a prison term			1
he said locking up thieves and fraudsters and ‘ condemning ’ them to prison was an ‘ abuse of state power ’			2
instead , he argued , they should be fined , given community service and forced to pay for the damage they have caused			1
the controversial comments in a pamphlet for a penal reform group were condemned as ‘ extreme ’ and ‘ callous ’ towards victims by crime prevention campaigners			1
prof @entity1 , now an @entity29 law professor , said jail was ‘ disproportionate ’ for what he called ‘ pure ’ property offences , including theft , handling stolen goods , criminal damage and fraud			1
depriving someone of their liberty for an offence that ‘ only ’ targeted property was unfair , he claimed , arguing that jail should be reserved for violent and sexual crimes			0
he described the theft of £ 250 worth of clothes from a store as ‘ in the overall scale of things ... not serious harm ’			0
prof @entity1 was chairman of the @entity50 for three years under @entity51 when there were repeated criticisms that policy was going soft			1
his comments came in a pamphlet for the @entity57 , which calls for fewer criminals to be jailed and a rise in the age of criminal responsibility , currently ten in @entity63			2
‘ we should be reserving our most severe form of punishment for our most serious types of offending , ’ said prof @entity1			1
‘ should someone be sent to prison and deprived of their liberty for an offence that involves no violence , no threats and no sexual assault ? ’ he said this was ‘ an abuse of state power ’			2
the professor added : ‘ instead , the priority should be to deal with such offences in the community , giving precedence to compensation for the victim and , where the offence is sufficiently serious , imposing a community sentence			2
’ the result of such a policy would be more than 25,000 fewer criminals sent to jail every year , most for theft and handling offences			0
@entity93 , director of the @entity94 , said : ‘ these extreme recommendations are callous towards victims and show a complete ignorance of the facts			0
prof @entity1 said jail was ' disproportionate ' for what he called ' pure ' property offences , including theft , handling stolen goods , criminal damage and fraud ( file picture ) ‘ only an ivory tower academic who started out determined to reduce prison numbers whatever the evidence could reach this conclusion			1
‘ theft is not a “ minor offence ”			0
victims can find their lives transformed by fear			0
making a promise to thieves and fraudsters that they will never go to prison is ridiculous			2
‘ already the courts bend over backwards to give criminals community sentences and fines which fail to protect the public			0
‘ more prison places and longer sentences would be better for victims and most likely to turn these thieves ’ lives around			0
’ last year , around 91,000 serious and repeat offenders , including thousands of thieves and other property criminals , escaped jail			1
@entity136 , chief executive of the @entity137 , said theft and fraud victims were losing out as too much priority was given to jailing criminals rather than returning stolen property and compensation			0
she backed fines , compensation orders and community sentences over jail ‘ which produce a much lower rate of reoffending at a fraction of the cost ’ .			0
