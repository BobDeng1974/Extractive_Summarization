by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 has put on a brave face before presenting doomed breakfast programme @entity5 for the last time			1
the host of the axed show was spotted on thursday looking tense and emotional after shooting the second last episode earlier in the day			1
but @entity3 is not the only one feeling the pain , with staff who have been told their jobs have been axed as part of @entity17 ’s cut backs being forced to come to work and sit at their desks with nothing to do while decisions are made over whether they have new roles within the ailing tv network			1
although they no longer have arrive at 3am – the usual start time for breakfast tv crew , they are being expected to put in a full working day			2
however with the show now canned , they are left twiddling their thumbs waiting to find out if they are one of the lucky few to be offered a new job			2
the insider said : ' the atmosphere is pretty bad			2
everyone is very down and as you can imagine the last thing they want to do is come into an office and sit at a desk when they have absolutely nothing to do			0
' they are trying to put a brave face on things but it ’s very tough			1
it ’s not a great place to be right now			0
' a day earlier @entity17 confirmed it was axing @entity5 as well as its early , morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs with the impact taking its toll on the presenter , she was seen with her arms crossed while walking on a busy footpath in @entity32 's eastern suburbs - and with the pain of the past 24 hours written all over her face			1
the 38 - year - old was also later spotted walking with a mobile phone in her hand as she clutched onto a pen and piece of paper			0
another image shows @entity3 clenching her hands tightly as she walked , and with her thoughts appearing to be elsewhere			1
the host 's demeanor was in stark contrast to the brave face she put the night before at the @entity92 and @entity93 @entity91 on wednesday evening , following news of the axing earlier that day			1
contrast : @entity3 put on a brave face when she attended the the @entity92 and @entity93 @entity91 on wednesday night , just hours after @entity17 announced it was axing @entity5 @entity5 will air for the last time this morning , with @entity99 and co-host @entity100 presenting what is expected to be sombre and emotional final episode			1
despite @entity3 learning on wednesday that @entity5 was due to get the chop , the presenter said she spent the afternoon after the announcement ' eating ice cream ' with her sons @entity107 and @entity109			1
' it 's a really sad day for @entity17 , ' she told the @entity111			1
' i 'm heartbroken but i have no regrets because i have put in 110 per cent since day one and you can not control circumstances that are out of your control			2
' @entity118 , @entity3 , and @entity100 , were the original co-hosts of @entity5 , which will cease production on friday @entity122 's @entity121 also attended the awards on wednesday night and said she felt sadness for her colleagues at the axed breakfast show			1
the television presenter said she felt guilty for being dressed up and attending the event , given the grim situation many of her co-workers were facing			0
' it 's awful , it is awful , ' @entity121 said of the announcement yesterday that @entity17 would be axing @entity5 , as well as its early , morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs			1
' in a way it kind of feels odd being here all frocked up and smiling when for a lot of people it 's bloody awful and it is really sad , ' she told @entity111			0
ms @entity121 is one of the hosts of @entity122 , which will remain on air , but she said despite the fact their show had been saved they were not ' happy '			0
' having in the past been through times when i have lost my job , it is not great			0
' @entity121 said it felt ' odd ' to be glammed up for an event on a day when it was announced that up to 150 employees at @entity17 would be losing their jobs			1
@entity5 was launched in november 2013 , in a bid to compete with @entity160 's @entity159 's today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop			2
@entity5 was the brainchild of @entity166 mastermind @entity165 , and was launched in november 2013 , with three hosts , @entity118 , @entity100 , and @entity3			1
just 16 - days later , ms @entity118 was cut from the panel , after it was decided the show 's chemistry was not working			0
