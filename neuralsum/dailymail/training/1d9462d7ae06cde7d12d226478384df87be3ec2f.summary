when i look at @entity2 without @entity3 or @entity4 , they badly lack pace and need @entity6			1
he turned 20 on monday and it is a lot to ask for a young man to be their talisman , but he has got to live up to that			0
@entity6 will be @entity2 's danger man in their @entity13 showdown against @entity14 @entity2 want him getting on the ball , dropping deep and dribbling with it , threatening through the centre off the striker			1
i do n’t want to see him out wide that much			0
there are not too many @entity2 players who want to go beyond the opposition , but @entity6 is their one player who can change the game in a split second			1
he ’ll be the man @entity14 are most afraid of			1
this game has got that feel about it where they will need a hero — and he has got the ability to be that man			0
@entity6 talks tactics with @entity2 manager @entity33 in training on monday stopping @entity35 in @entity35 the @entity37 side have a free - scoring attacking midfield player who will be the main threat to @entity2 ’s goal			1
he is @entity14 ’s top scorer with 12 goals in all competitions and eight in his past eight games			2
if @entity45 starts in front of the back four he will need to be on top of his game to keep the @entity51 quiet			0
it is crucial that @entity2 do not concede early on in this match so they must be wary of @entity35 ’s danger			1
@entity35 ( centre ) will pose a threat to @entity2 's defence on tuesday night let @entity58 play if @entity33 plays @entity45 in that deeper role it will also give @entity58 licence to play in midfield			1
not off the front man just behind the striker , but simply in midfield			0
due to how well @entity58 played in front of the back four last season , he has been caught between playing there or at the top of a diamond			2
he needs to shed that			0
why ca n’t gerrard just be a midfield player ? look at @entity73 for @entity74 , he ’s just a midfield player			0
he is given that freedom			0
that ’s what @entity2 need with @entity58 , let him roam box to box			1
@entity81 nights need big players and that ’s what he is			0
@entity58 leads the way during training on monday ahead of the big game @entity58 looks relaxed in the build - up to the @entity91 clash - a decade on from his heroics against @entity93 avoiding the @entity14 graveyard it is impossible not to forget the humiliating night in 2011 when @entity14 beat @entity96 2 - 1 to dump them out of the @entity13 , when they only needed a draw to go through			1
@entity2 ’s record against them is not great , either			2
they are yet to win and have drawn twice and lost once			0
@entity14 have played @entity100 opposition nine times and only lost once			2
@entity102 looks dejected as @entity96 crashed to a shock defeat in @entity37 back in 2011 having little patience @entity2 have to score , they must win to go through and the fact a draw is good enough for @entity14 means the @entity37 side could sit back			1
they are likely to rely on hitting @entity2 on the break			2
that could play into @entity2 ’s hands			0
they have the capabilities to open up their opponents , but they might need to take their time and not rush anything in order to win			0
@entity33 insists @entity2 must be patient in their must - win clash on @entity118 @entity2 players enjoy a game of keepy - uppy in training on monday			1

@entity2 face @entity14 at @entity91 in the @entity13
@entity127 star 's pace will be vital in must - win @entity91 clash on tuesday
@entity33 ' side must stop in - form @entity14 ace @entity35
@entity58 must be given licence to attack and hurt @entity37 side
