these beautiful pictures of @entity2 prayers and glowing nativity scenes hide a much darker reality			2
hundreds of @entity5 , who now occupy these makeshift tents in @entity7 , were forced to abandon their homes to escape the wrath of @entity11 fighters			2
they are safe from immediate danger in this camp built around the @entity15 in @entity16			2
but dropping temperatures pose a serious threat to those who hurriedly left their homes without their possessions or winter clothes			1
eerie : a beautifully decorated christmas tree and nativity scene provide a centre - piece for the sadness around them pray : the children who inhabit this camp , built around a @entity30 in @entity7 , wish simply to return home @entity32 lost : this make - shift existence has become their reality - where they live and where they play safe : they are safe from immediate danger on the grounds of the @entity15 , but dropping temperatures in the camp pose a new threat @entity2 spirit : but they 've refused to let danger - imminent or otherwise - dampen their festive spirit life goes on : nor have they let it hinder their education			1
their lessons continue in a make - shift tent on the @entity30 grounds @entity2 prayers : at night , they gather with their families around a candle - lit shrine in their new home sacrifice : almost a million of them ( internally displaced @entity64 ) will celebrate @entity2 in these temporary camps temporary home : and nearly half of those will be spending the winter period in the @entity71 region of @entity72 saturated : over 250,000 @entity74 refugees had already settled in the autonomous region when @entity11 began advancing further into @entity72 in june keeping the faith : it has massively strained the resources in the autonomous region which is , for now , safe from @entity79 new wave : but with the fighting set to continue , it could be a matter of time before the population reaches breaking point over 250,000 @entity74 refugees had already settled in the autonomous @entity71 region in @entity72 when @entity11 extremist began to advance further into @entity72 in june			1
since then , another one and a half million displaced refugees have flocked to the area			0
purpose - built camps have been built for many but the sheer number of evacuees means thousands of families have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little or no warmth , and no realistic prospect of returning home			1
over three million @entity64 people have been displaced from their homes and nearly two million of them have relocated inside the country , according to the @entity101			1
their movement is almost entirely a result of the fighting taking place between the @entity64 security forces and @entity108 fighters against @entity11 extremists			0
reality : @entity64 refugees have to queue to receive their food parcels from @entity113 on the outskirts of @entity16 hungry : the men , women and children who travel to this food distribution centre are completely reliant on the aid organisations supplying it queuing : hundreds of them will wait their turn until they can finally pick up the food their families need to survive survival : they 'll haul their food parcels back to their refugee camp in @entity7 to continue their day - to - day existence new life : these food parcels are vital in keeping these families alive but the dropping temperatures pose another serious threat it 's thought that almost half of all internally displaced @entity64 's have fled to towns in @entity71 , which is putting huge pressure on the region			1
the @entity143 announced the situation there as a level - three emergency - their highest classification of a humanitarian crisis			0
nations around the world have expressed their commitment to help the refugee crisis in @entity72 and @entity74			2
on tuesday , the @entity143 refugee agency reported that 28 nations have pledged to take in more than 100,000 people who 've been uprooted by civil war in @entity74			0
entertainment : they hurriedly fled from their homes to avoid capture , or worse , at the hands of @entity11			0
some pass the time through music lunch time : others prepare meals for their families as they would have done back in their homes family portrait : others seem happy enough to be together , despite the desperate situation they find themselves in accommodation : purpose - built camps were built for thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting in @entity72 and @entity74 @entity177 fix : but the sheer number of evacuees means thousands have to settle in unfinished buildings which offer little to no warmth prayer : what 's worse is there is no realistic prospect of them ever returning home the @entity189 are currently considering applications to resettle 9,000 of them			1
as it stands , only around 300 refugees have been housed in the country			0
the humanitarian organisation , @entity195 , airlifted tens of thousands of gift packages to camps like this in @entity7 on wednesday			0
people from the @entity189 , @entity200 and @entity201 combined to fill 60,000 shoe - boxes with small gifts and ' uplifting messages ' , according to the @entity205			0
of the two million people displaced within @entity72 , nearly half have fled to safety in @entity71 , putting huge pressure on the region â€™s resources , which has led the @entity143 to designate the situation as a level - three emergency , the highest classification of a humanitarian crisis .			1

hundreds of displaced @entity64 , forced to evacuate their towns , will celebrate @entity2 in this refugee camp in @entity7
they represent a tiny *fraction* of over three million @entity64 people ' internally displaced ' - many of them in @entity71
the autonomous region in @entity72 is being pushed to breaking point by sheer number of new settlers
families are safe , for now , from any immediate danger but dropping temperatures pose another serious threat
