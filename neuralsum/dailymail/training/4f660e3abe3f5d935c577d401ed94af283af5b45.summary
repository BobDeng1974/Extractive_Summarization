scientists have finally discovered why residents in a remote @entity3 village known as @entity4 are mysteriously falling asleep for days at a time			1
they claim radon gas from nearby @entity7 - era uranium mines seeped up to the surface and poisoned the residents of @entity10			1
@entity11 is a colourless , odourless and tasteless gas which occurs naturally through the decay of uranium and breathing it is thought to cause lung cancer			1
local government officials are considering plans to move the entire village because they feel it is impossible to eradicate radon gas from the area			1
although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous , they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above			2
' @entity27 ' : after four years of studies , scientists have finally discovered the cause of a mysterious illness which caused people to fall asleep for days radiation : scientists say radon , which occurred naturally from uranium in nearby mines , seeped to the surface and poisoned the residents of @entity10 deadly : radon - a colourless , odourless and tasteless gas - is thought to cause lung cancer and has affected around one in five people in @entity10 ( pictured ) radioactive remains : although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous , they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above professor @entity49 from the @entity51 - ecology and geo - chemistry concluded the local mines were to blame after ruling out a virus or bacteria as the cause			1
he said : ' the mines left open spaces underground which were slowly filled with water that has risen upwards , driving pockets of gas inside them to the surface			1
' the gas has a toxic effect that pushes a person into a dream like state , and the person then falls asleep			1
' professor @entity69 and @entity70 have carried out thousands of experiments on the area for over four years			1
they failed to find radon because conventional methods of measuring radiation do not detect it in the air			1
he added : ' we eliminated viral and bacterial infections but also obtained test results that ruled out the possibility of radiation sickness too			0
' we also failed to find any evidence that toxic chemicals were buried in the area as many locals claimed			1
' initially , medics who examined the dozing villagers found they were suffering from excessive fluid in the brain but could not work out why			0
desperate measures : local government officials in @entity10 ( pictured ) are now considering plans to move the village entirely infected : children affected by the mystery illness are so dizzy they can barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed nightmare : professor @entity49 from the @entity51 - ecology and geo - chemistry said the ' toxic gas ' induces its victims ' into a dream like state ' doctor @entity107 , who examined the victims , said : ' in medical terms they are suffering from encephalopathy , a disorder of the brain but the cause is unclear			1
' scans have shown that many of the sufferers have excessive accumulation of fluid in their brains			0
' according to the @entity120 , radon decays quickly , giving off tiny radioactive particles			2
when inhaled , these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung			0
long - term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer , the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon			1
there has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children however , the evidence is not conclusive			2
@entity11 is present in nearly all air			2
everyone breathes in radon every day , usually at very low levels			2
however , people who inhale high levels of radon are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer			1
last summer , 60 people were taken to hospital suffering from the condition which leaves people feeling dizzy , unable to stand , fatigued and with memory problems			0
children affected by the mystery illness could barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed			2
scientists recently stepped up their investigation after locals complained the situation was getting worse			0
it is thought nearly one in five of @entity10 's 600 residents have been affected by the strange sleep disorder			1
scientists stepped up the investigation recently after locals complained that incidences of the strange sleeping disorder were getting worse , with nearly one in five of the village 's 600 residents now affected			1
they said the fact that some miners remained unaffected because they have built up a natural immunity to radon			0
@entity170 , a local resident , said some men from the area had gone down the shaft in one of the mines and detected a sweet smell while down there			2
the 54 - year - old told @entity178 : ' we are afraid of what lies in store			0
we 're afraid that we may all fall asleep			0
' ghost town : @entity184 's neighbouring town @entity185 has been deserted since the closure of the neighbouring uranium mine terrifying discovery : a @entity178 film crew found radiation levels at a filled in mine shaft were 16 times higher than normal background levels top secret : in the @entity7 era , @entity185 was a secret and ' closed ' uranium mining town run directly from @entity198 another resident @entity199 , whose son suffers from the condition , said : ' he runs around and then he gets inert , starts staggering			1
' when he turns his head his eyes stay fixed at what he was looking at			0
if you try to wake him it seems the wants to open his eyes but ca n't			0
sleepy valley , sleepy hollow , that 's what people call us			0
' @entity214 , 60 , claims to be the first resident to have fallen asleep in april 2010 and has since suffered seven separate episodes			0
she was diagnosed with ischemic strokes but then her neighbour began displaying the same symptoms			0
some have even reported suffering from vivid hallucinations			0
in september 2014 , a @entity178 film crew reported radiation doses 16 times higher than would be expected from background radiation near the entrance of the abandoned mine			0
some locals claimed wind and smoke coming from the mines may be responsible for the illness			2
others claimed toxic waste has been buried in the area .			0

scientists say nearby @entity7 - era uranium mines caused mysterious illness
known to cause cancer , radon occurs naturally through decay of uranium
the ' toxic gas ' induces its victims into a ' dream like state ' said one expert
local officials are considering plans to move the remote village of @entity10
professor @entity49 has been examining the village for four years
they failed to find traces of radon because it is *difficult* to detect in the air
