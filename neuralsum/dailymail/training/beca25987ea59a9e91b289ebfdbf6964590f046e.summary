@entity0 's larger than life character made him a popular hit among football fans up and down the country during his playing career			1
since retiring the 36 - year - old has released a book titled @entity8 it like @entity0 , as the former @entity10 midfielder tries to expand his horizons beyond football			1
on monday it was announced that @entity0 will be entering this year 's version of reality tv show i 'm a celebrity ... @entity17 ! where his sense of humour is bound to prove a hit in the @entity22 jungle			1
ahead of his trip down under , @entity23 reviews @entity0 's top 10 most memorable quotes			1
former @entity26 , @entity10 and @entity27 midfielder @entity0 will be on i 'm a celebrity ... @entity17 ! ‘ @entity32 was my massive idol			1
i never met him until six weeks ago , when i found out he was at my local golf club and dashed up there			1
i did n’t really know how to approach him , it ’s difficult			1
“ @entity33 , i ’ve got hundreds of old @entity35 tapes of you back home			1
bit perverted , i know , but that ’s what i think of you ”			1
’ ‘ the bloke was immaculate			1
his kit was tight and fitted him perfectly			1
@entity42 became @entity44 club captain and his skipper ’s armband had claret and blue tassles hanging off it , making him look like a warrior			1
' socks rolled up perfectly over his permanently shaved , well - oiled legs , he oozed @entity54 class and style			1
he was a real man			1
and he was also an utterly terrifying nutcase			2
’ @entity0 said his idol growing up was @entity32 and he feared @entity42 during his time at @entity44 ‘ [ @entity60 ] @entity59 was also my partner in crime when it came to taking the p * * * out of mr @entity64			1
i remember looking at the gaffer on my first day and thinking , ‘ i ca n’t believe how much he looks like @entity66 ; it ’s him ! ’ @entity59 obviously loved it - ‘ wa - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha ! ’ - and when we were on the team coach , we sat at the back and started singing the @entity66 theme tune			1
a few of the boys joined in - i think @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 might have had a quiet little sing - along - but most of the other dry lunches were n’t really up for it			1
’ @entity83 ( centre ) used to be @entity0 's partner in crime when joking about @entity87 boss @entity64 ‘ my first training session with @entity90 … a bus took us to @entity92 ’s training ground at @entity93			1
as it parked , @entity94 was itching to get off			2
the door opened and he flew out of it like a dog let off its leash			2
he legged it straight to one of the goals , picked a few balls out of the net and started shelling them at the crossbar , hitting it every time			2
‘ @entity94 ! ’ screamed @entity64			2
‘ you ’ll pull a muscle ! ’ ‘ @entity110 , i ’ve not pulled a muscle since i was 13 , ’ said @entity94			2
the pace of the training was at least twice as quick as i was used to at @entity10			2
we started with a five - vs - five keep - ball session in an area that seemed not much bigger than a tablecloth			1
the ball was still pinging about like a pinball as pass after pass was completed			2
after a drill like that , i could n’t believe @entity90 get slagged off by pundits for not being able to pass the ball			2
maybe our problem is we need to play internationals on pitches the size of tablecloths			2
’ @entity0 ( left ) says he was impressed by @entity90 's level of ability during training sessions ‘ i never felt @entity64 gave the boys a lot of direction			1
for starters , his @entity139 was poor and it was very difficult to understand what he was going on about most of the time			2
the only thing he said that stuck was : “ let ’s all attack together , let ’s all defend together			2
” not terrible advice , but when i remembered that this was international football , the pinnacle of the game , i thought it was just a little bit basic			0
to be frank , i ’d had better coaching when i was playing @entity151			0
’ @entity0 was critical of @entity64 's grasp of the @entity139 language during their time together ‘ the manager [ @entity64 ] did n’t make it easy , to be fair			1
we spent two weeks away with @entity90 and he said two sentences to me			0
‘ you ca n’t have a laugh , you ca n’t have a drink ; you eat when you ’re told to			0
what ’s all that about ? why ca n’t you eat when you ’re hungry ? i ca n’t stand it all			0
i ’ve never understood it , but it ’s professional and it ’s the done thing			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) also revealed that he was n't a fan of @entity64 strict management during his @entity90 reign ‘ i came in one monday morning at @entity10 after we ’d lost 3 - 0 and i was stretching and laughing with @entity170 , @entity171 and a couple of others			1
@entity174 ’s come in and gone , “ stop laughing , we lost on saturday ”			0
then his next team talk on thursday is , “ @entity177 , let ’s look forward to the next game ”			0
well , i ca n’t really , @entity174 , because you ’ve just murdered me on monday for laughing			0
a lot of managers do that			0
they say something and do n’t really mean it			0
on thursday it ’s all right to have a laugh , is it ? monday too fresh ? so , when ’s the rule come in ? when can i laugh ? tuesday night ? let me know			0
breakfast time wednesday ? is it longer depending on the score ? i do n’t understand it			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) and @entity170 were once told off by then - @entity10 boss @entity174 for laughing ‘ i took fitness as a given and thought it was n’t a skill , but it is			1
if we went on a long run , @entity193 would run like he had a caravan on his back , but you would n’t beat him in a sprint			0
razor ( @entity206 ) was the unfittest player i ever saw and the most outrageous person i ever met			0
‘ @entity209 , i ’ve broke me arm in seven places … ‘ do n’t go back to them seven places , then			0
’ a meeting [ to discuss a new contract ] was set up between me , my agent @entity216 , @entity174 and the @entity10 chief executive @entity217			0
@entity216 and i met up with the chief exec , but there was no sign of @entity174			0
@entity217 was a bit confused by that and called him , only to find out he was playing golf and would n’t be coming			0
that was the end of that meeting			0
i thought it was bang out of order			0
it does n’t matter if you ’re the chairman , owner or manager , you have to treat people with respect and that ’s pretty much what i told @entity174 the next time i saw him			0
i asked him where he ’d been when we were supposed to have had a meeting and i told him it showed me and my agent a lack of respect			0
perhaps i should n’t have been so hostile , but his decision not to attend that meeting spoke volumes			0
@entity0 played under @entity174 at @entity10 between 2007 and 2009 , helping the club avoid relegation in 2008 extracts from @entity0 ’s autobiography bend it like @entity250 , published by @entity251 at £ 16.99 , copyright © 2014 @entity0 , and from an interview published on @entity254 in may 2014 .			1
