he claimed all along the boy slammed his head against his hand while violently swaying and rocking in a bid to run away			2
chairman of the bench @entity47 said : ' we accept that there were aggravating facts presented to us in that the boy was behaving in an unruly manner			2
we really have doubts over whether the contact constituted an assault			2
' after the case was thrown out mr @entity0 ’s son @entity57 , speaking on his behalf , said : ' the family have had overwhelming support over my father ’s case but it should never have come to court in the first place			1
' the fact is there is an issue today with unruly children and it has come to this where dedicated teachers are repeatedly appearing before the courts on their say - so			0
' it caused a lot of distress and all because of one child where there were not enough measures in place to deal with him			0
' a retired detective inspector and a parent gave evidence at the hearing praising mr @entity0 as a dedicated and professional teacher of the ' highest standards			1
' @entity87 , a parent , @entity88 member , governor at the school and former senior police officer , said : ' i always found mr @entity0 a very enthusiastic teacher			1

' this is because of one child			0
there are not enough measures to deal with this			0
' the court heard how the incident occurred last march while mr @entity0 , from @entity110 , was involved in a rehearsal for a forthcoming school production of @entity113			1
the boy had become ' hysterical and out of control ' in a class and one teacher , @entity117 , said the pupil was in such a rage he grabbed railings to stop him being taken to mr @entity0 ’s office , continuously shouting ‘ get off me , get off me ’			1
he said he saw mr @entity0 hit the child and threaten to do it again if he did not calm down			1
he told magistrates : ' mr @entity0 was not using a technique i knew , but he seemed in charge			1
he was being forceful but fair			0
' the child ’s arms were flailing and he kept on shouting , getting more and more hysterical			0
mr @entity0 released or lost control of the boy ’s left arm and then he struck him across the face			1
' mr @entity135 prosecuting said : ' mr @entity0 has a long and distinguished teaching career with many decades behind him			2
he is a well - respected and well liked deputy head at the school			1
' but the prosecution say that you can not slap a boy across the face			0
' speaking in court @entity0 responded : ' as a teacher with over 40 years ’ experience this allegation has come as a great shock to me and caused me and my family great distress			1
' since the boy started school he was a disruptive and aggressive pupil and frequently disrupted the school			0
he is probably the worst of the pupils i have ever taught in 40 years of teaching and on occasions he is uncontrollable			0
' he worked himself into an incandescent rage , i knew it was all bluster and knew he would eventually calm down			0
i had to be calm but firm with him			0
' another teacher went to mr @entity0 ’s aid as the tried to restrain the boy and calm him down			1
but mr @entity0 said : ' because he had just been restrained he was more agitated than he had been and was trying to break free from his arms			2
' i was trying to get him to stop wobbling round because he was getting more agitated and he slammed himself into my hand			0
he just kept rolling and rocking and trying to get rid of the restrain			0
all the time i was speaking in a calm quiet voice saying ‘ calm down ’ but once i had let go of his hands i may have said , ‘ do you want me to do it again ’ to stop his hands from moving			0
' but i do not believe a slap across the face is a method of controlling children			0
' @entity174 , a former headteacher at the school said : “ @entity0 has worked to the highest of standards			2
he was an example to other members of staff			0
' i have to say , over a long period of time the school functioned well and a lot of that was down to @entity0 ’s work in the school			2
' mr @entity0 ’s lawyer @entity183 said : ' the boy was an unruly pupil and has been since he started nursery			1
in mr @entity0 ’s experience the worst in over 40 years ’ teaching			2
' mr @entity0 had been forceful but fair and went to assist as the boy ’s arms were flaring			2
he is someone who deals with unruly pupils and he has dealt with these for many years			0
' he is not the kind of man who would deliberately strike a young boy like this			0
this matter has got out of hand			0
