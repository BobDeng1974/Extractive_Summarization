spotted : one man has stunned professional archaeologists by locating a @entity8 settlement using @entity9			1
this aerial picture taken in 1989 shows the area in @entity18 , @entity19			0
the lines indicate the location of the prehistoric buildings thought to lie beneath the earth he began his search for a settlement by trawling satellite images for the sort of terrain that would have offered food , water and shelter to prehistoric man			1
using @entity35 ’s overhead mapping website to zoom in on fields and farmland , he managed to pinpoint a site in @entity18 in the @entity39 , @entity19			2
the former @entity40 from @entity41 , @entity19 , then sought permission from the local landowner before using a metal detector to look for remains			1

unearthed : @entity11 unearthed scraps of metal , pottery shards and flint tools ( pictured ) at the prehistoric site			1
they include an @entity58 hinge from a bucket ( the curved piece of metal )			0
experts hope to find more similar fragments when they excavate the site in february next year excavations are ongoing to establish the importance of the settlement , which lies in @entity18 in the @entity39 , @entity19			1
it is thought to be @entity8 , or @entity58			2
@entity11 discovered flint tools , pottery fragments and metal shards thought to be 5,000 years old			1
a geophysical survey revealed two large buried structures thought to be prehistoric farm buildings			1
other parts of the settlement could date from @entity77 , between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago			2
the survey images show tracks , enclosures and pits , which could indicate a metal works			0
mr @entity11 told @entity84 archaeologist @entity83 about his discovery , who carried out a geophysical survey using ground - penetrating radar equipment			2
together , they found two large buried structures that they believe are farm buildings dating back to the @entity8 or @entity58			1
mr @entity83 said : ‘ the survey shows two or three probable farmsteads which look to be late prehistoric , bronze age to @entity58			0
‘ other parts of the underlying settlement possibly continue to the @entity99 - @entity98 period , around 1,500 to 2,000 years ago			2
‘ the images also show tracks and enclosures , as well as a number of pits , which alongside @entity11 ’s findings , looks like evidence of metal works			0
‘ we know that @entity19 ’s mineral resources were being traded along the coast and along the channel in prehistoric times			2
scanned : the former @entity40 from @entity41 , @entity19 , sought permission from the local landowner before using a metal detector to look for evidence of prehistoric habitation on the land ( pictured ) ‘ while @entity119 is famous for preserved historic sites , the same is not true of coastal areas			1
so this could be the missing link between those moorland sites and the evidence we have of trading			0
’ mr @entity11 , who is now a commercial diver , said : ‘ night after night i looked at @entity9 asking myself the question ‘ if i was alive 3,000 years ago where would i live ’			2
‘ i would need food , water , shelter , close to @entity119 for minerals , close to a river to access the sea and trade routes			0
‘ after a few weeks i put an “ @entity136 ” on the map - that was where i would live			0
’ he was initially unable to test his theory because he was unsure who the land belonged to , until he came across the landowner by chance			0

small finds are pictured left ‘ at kids rugby training one night i remembered that one of the other coaches was a farmer and i asked him if i could field walk and detect on his land			0
‘ as i did n’t know where his farm was , i arranged for my family and i to meet him and he gave us a tour of his fields			0
‘ it was then i found out that my “ @entity136 ” was on his land - it was unbelievable			0
’ it is hoped that a series of trench digs , set to take place february next year , will provide further evidence of the prehistoric settlement			0
mr @entity11 has previously searched for ancient artefacts underwater and in 2010 he was involved in the discovery of a 300 - year - old @entity183 merchant vessel called the @entity184 , off the @entity19 coast .			2

former @entity40 from @entity41 , @entity19 , trawled @entity9 for terrain that would have offered food , water and shelter to prehistoric men
he pinpointed a spot in @entity39 and found the landowner to *investigate*
@entity11 unearthed scraps of metal , pottery shards and flint tools dating back 5,000 years - *hinting* the site was a @entity8 settlement
experts surveyed the field and found two large buried farm buildings
