@entity0 watched as @entity1 edged himself towards a place in @entity4 's season - end finale , her face almost as inscrutable as that of her predecessor @entity7			1
@entity0 takes a much more consensual approach than @entity7 , and is delighted with the recent results which now see her client just one match away from ending any arguments about making the @entity14 finals next month			1
after a comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 4 win over her compatriot @entity17 in the @entity18 his entry can be confirmed if he beats @entity19			2
@entity1 acknowledges spectators after beating @entity17 in the @entity18 @entity1 's coach @entity0 ( front right ) watched on as @entity1 defeated her compatriot @entity0 will regard qualification as a satisfactory conclusion to the first five months of their groundbreaking coaching arrangement , although she acknowledges it will up the ante for next season			1
as she made clear , she is certainly different to the my - way - or - the - highway style of @entity7 when it comes to coaching , suggesting that @entity1 is more in the driving seat than he was under @entity7			1
' it 's a manager 's role without being a dictator , you are just there to be a guide , ' she told @entity42 newspaper			1
' the driving force is the player			2
it 's the player who drives the whole team with their obsession , their concern for each detail and their strong goals			1
' the champions always question things			2
the demand is constant so you look around trying to find solutions and ways to adapt			0
it 's the challenge that is interesting to me			2
if you have a beautiful adventure together it 's great			2
if for any reason he wants to change or stop it 's not a problem			2
' maybe when we arrive in @entity69 there will be more pressure			0
in the 2015 @entity72 there will be more expectation			1
at present he is in a rising phase , at these moments you do n't feel the pressure so much			0
what counts is not what people or the media says , the most important thing for me is the project			0
i 'm not thinking " if he does n't win i will be questioned "			0
' @entity87 hard work paying off for @entity1 @entity0 , pictured watching @entity1 in a practice session , is hoping the @entity89 can really kick on in 2015 @entity1 and @entity7 ( right ) went their separate ways in march 2014 when they ended their partnership the sometimes seen erratic on - court behaviour of @entity1 since the authoritative @entity7 departed was absent as he dismissed @entity17 in 72 minutes , making light of the draining schedule which is now seeing him play six consecutive weeks			1
@entity98 ( 2005 – 2006 ) @entity99 ( 2006 – 2007 ) @entity100 ( 2007 – 2010 ) @entity101 ( 2010 – 2011 ) @entity7 ( 2011 – 2014 ) in 35 days there have been 19 victories , and the @entity104 has actually won more matches this year – 57 – than any other player bar @entity107			0
no wonder morale is high around the camp , but the real test for the @entity1 - @entity0 partnership is likely to come next season			1
it is the kind of dominant form that was proving so elusive for the @entity116 no 1 around the time that @entity19 provided the most crushing disappointment of the season , the @entity119 quarter - final defeat when he appeared to be tormented			0
amid @entity122 mania there was much speculation about some he was supposed to have shouted at his box about something happening ' five minutes ' before the match , although more reliable sources said it was ' 45 minutes '			0
it was an unusual episode for @entity1 on the @entity130 – where he is usually so controlled , and hence the brouhaha – but more common at other less visible events			1
' the stuff that i say on the court , anyone that knows anything about how my brain works would know it does n't really actually mean much , ' he said			0
' it was complete nonsense			0
it had no bearing on the outcome of the match at all			0
it was turned into something that was supposedly that i was having big problems with my team or with @entity0 or with @entity150 ( @entity151 ) or whatever			1
but it was completely not the case			0

@entity0 is delighted with @entity1 's recent results
however she hopes the @entity89 will push on in the 2015 @entity72
@entity0 has made a *conscientious* decision to manage rather than dictate @entity1 's *career*
