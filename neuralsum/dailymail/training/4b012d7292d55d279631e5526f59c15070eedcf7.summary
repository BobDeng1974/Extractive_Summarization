by @entity0 published : 18:22 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 10 october 2013 a crackdown on sham marriages could herald the end of the ‘ shotgun wedding ’			1
the current period giving notice of a ceremony is to be virtually doubled from 15 days to 28			0
the move - part of the @entity8 announced yesterday - is designed to give immigration officials enough time to investigate whether a proposed union is genuine			2
tightened : the move is part of the @entity8 published yesterday is designed to make it easier for officials to catch sham marriages most sham marriages in @entity17 involve an @entity18 national with the right to be here marrying someone from outside the @entity18			1
but the notification rules will apply equally to all couples - including two @entity17 - to comply with equality laws			1
marriage campaigners welcomed the shift , saying it would help ensure marriages were built on firm foundations			1
@entity31 of the @entity32 said : ‘ this is good news for all couples			1
there is lots of evidence that whirlwind romances are more likely to end in tears than couples who spend more time thinking about it			0
’ the @entity41 estimates that some 10,000 applications to stay in @entity17 a year are based on a ‘ false ’ wedding or civil partnership			2
most sham marriages in @entity17 take place between an @entity18 nation with the right to be here and someone from outside the @entity18 but the rules will apply equally to all couples the change was detailed in the @entity8 published by the @entity41 yesterday , which ministers insist will make it harder for illegal immigrants to set up home in the @entity17			1
illegal migrants will be banned from getting driving licences , opening bank accounts and renting private homes , with new checks imposed on bank managers , landlords and driving instructions			0
it will also be easier to remove foreign criminals from @entity17 , refuse them bail and even kick them out first and ‘ hear their appeal later ’			2
the sham marriage changes are a major new plank of efforts to fight a serious problem for the authorities			0
under existing rules , anyone who wants to marry must tell their local register office or church 15 days before the planned wedding date , and details of the union are then posted on a notice board			0
from next year , this period will be extended to 28 days			0
the new rules will allow officials who suspect a bogus wedding may be about to take place to extend the notice period to 70 days - allowing them to investigate			1
astonishingly , existing rules restrict the ability of officials from sharing information with the @entity41 when they suspect a bogus union is about to take place			2
foreign nationals from outside the @entity18 wanting to get married in a church will first have to go to the register office and get approval - ensuring the authorities are made aware of the planned wedding			1
from 2005 , migrants from outside the @entity18 were required to obtain a certificate of approval from the government before they could marry			2
but this was abolished in 2011 after a court ruled in breached human rights laws			0
since then the problem of sham weddings has raised major concerns			0
immigration minister @entity108 said : ‘ @entity110 marriages have for too long been an easy target for migrants seeking to circumvent our immigration rules , often assisted by organised criminals			0
‘ registrars are frustrated when they marry couples who are obviously sham ; we need more effective tools to deal with it			0
‘ by extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period to 28 days in @entity123 and @entity124 and allowing this to be increased to 70 days in some circumstances we will make time to investigate , prosecute and remove those involved in sham marriages			1

most sham marriages in @entity17 take place between an @entity18 national and a non @entity18 national but rules will apply to all couples - even if both partners are @entity17
ministers insist the move will make it harder for illegal immigrants to set up home in the @entity17
has been welcomed by campaigners who call it ' good news for all couples '
