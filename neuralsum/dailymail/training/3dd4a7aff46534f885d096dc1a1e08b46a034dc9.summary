everyone 's heard of the crocodile hunter , well meet the crocodile huntress - a school girl from @entity5 's @entity4			2
this @entity6 17 - year - old has been posted on possibly the most dangerous internship any school student has ever faced , catching crocodiles with some of @entity5 's most experienced reptile handlers in @entity12			1
it 's a job not for the faint - hearted and probably one most adults would n't do if they were paid			0
but @entity15 , channeling the late @entity16 , is getting up close and personal with the river monsters while working on a school - based internship			1
a 3.4 metre crocodile is one of the trophy crocs that @entity22 helped pull in during the croc expedition no fear : @entity25 is a natural at working with one of @entity5 's most dangerous animals gotcha : a 3.4 metre croc was caged during an internship expedition @entity15 was on in @entity12 and although she might seem young , those with an enthusiasm for taming wild animals seem to start at an early age			1
by the time @entity16 was nine years old , he was helping his dad catch small crocodiles in muddy creek beds and wrestling them back to his dinghy			0
it was a skill he carried on into in his adult years spawning the television series @entity45			0
and it appears his legend is living on through @entity22 who might have inherited the similar thrill seeking genes made famous by @entity16			0
in one of the teenager 's pictures the crocodile management team , from the @entity55 , tempt a large crocodile with a long piece of rope with some bait attached to a pulley			2
@entity16 was catching crocodiles from the tender age of nine the reptile takes hold of the bait and wrestles its way towards the boat before being captured and caged			1
once boxed inside the security of the steel structure , it 's counted alongside hundreds more caught by the handlers to get an idea of the number swimming in @entity5 's far northern rivers			0
it is one of two crocs the handlers captured that day , the other being a two - metre crocodile pulled from a nearby creek			1
it brought the number of crocodiles caught in the @entity4 this this year to 151			2
from @entity12 's @entity84 , @entity22 has been volunteering on a school - based internship and venturing out on tours like this for the past two months			1
she told the @entity88 being on ' croc patrol ' was part of the daily tasks of the internship which also saw her working inside @entity94			0
the crocodile management team are capturing and surveying the reptiles to get a better idea of its habitat , how many and to warn humans of the locations where they should never go .			0

she has been pictured at the helm of a boat and holding a baby crocodile
