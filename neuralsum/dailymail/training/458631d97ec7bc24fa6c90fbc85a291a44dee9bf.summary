language : @entity1 , who runs @entity2 , said the term ' terrorist ' was too ' loaded ' and ' value - laden ' to describe @entity7 killers @entity9 and @entity8 and their accomplice @entity10 the @entity2 was branded ‘ mad ’ yesterday after a top executive said the @entity7 killers should not be described as ‘ terrorists ’			1
@entity1 , head of @entity2 , said the term terrorist was too ‘ loaded ’ and ‘ value - laden ’ to describe the fanatics who murdered 12 people at the @entity19 satirical magazine			1
the @entity2 backed his comments but faced a storm of criticism			2
@entity23 said the only things ‘ loaded ’ were the killers ’ weapons			0
‘ i think the @entity2 would be well advised to look at the @entity27 or any other good dictionary ’s definition of terrorism , ’ he said			2
the @entity32 peer , whose wife was left paralysed by the @entity37 ’s @entity36 bomb 31 years ago , added : ‘ i find it strange that the @entity2 should be trying to hide the nature of these people ... they are as mad as rats , are n’t they ? ’ @entity2 coverage of the atrocities in @entity44 , and the @entity46 school massacre in @entity47 , @entity48 , last month , studiously avoided using the word ‘ terrorist ’ , except when quoting other people , in line with its editorial guidelines			1
instead tv , radio and online reports described the murderers who carried out the attacks as ‘ militants ’ or ‘ gunmen ’			0
mr @entity1 , whose licence - fee - funded tv , radio and online news services reach 36million worldwide every week , told @entity64 : ‘ we try to avoid describing anyone as a terrorist or an act as being terrorist			0
' what we try to do is to say that “ two men killed 12 people in an attack on the office of a satirical magazine ”			1
that ’s enough , we know what that means and what it is			0
‘ terrorism is such a loaded word			2
we know what murder , bombings and shootings are , and we describe them			0
' that ’s much more revealing , we believe , than using a word like terrorist which people will see as value - laden			1
’ last night @entity32 mp @entity92 said : ‘ i ’ve heard of political correctness but even by the @entity2 ’s standards that ’s outrageous			2
the @entity2 has completely lost its sense			1
’ fellow @entity32 mp @entity115 , who sits on the @entity116 , added : ‘ it is yet another example of orwellian “ 1984 ” use of language by the @entity2 which serves to mask rather than illuminate			2
’ professor @entity120 , director of the @entity121 at the @entity122 , said : ‘ pulling this particular punch over terrorism is so serious that this man needs to consider his position			0
' and the @entity2 needs to ask itself whether this view inspires confidence in its reporting or does the opposite			2
’ @entity23 ( left ) said the only things ‘ loaded ’ were the killers ’ weapons and said the @entity2 ' would be well advised to look at the @entity27			1
' @entity32 mp @entity92 ( right ) also said it was ' outrageous ' @entity2 reporters are not banned from using words they deem appropriate but are asked to use their judgment			2
editorial guidelines say the word ‘ terrorist ’ should be avoided unless quoting someone else			0
the guidelines also state : ‘ we recognise the existence and the reality of terrorism ... ‘ we have learnt from the experience of covering such events in @entity149 as much as in @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 or the many other places where violence divides communities , and where we seek to be seen as objective by all sides , that labels applied to groups can sometimes hinder rather than help			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ there is no @entity2 ban on the word “ terrorist ” , as can be seen from our reporting of the terrorist attack in @entity44 , though we prefer a more precise description if possible			1
‘ the head of @entity2 was simply reflecting @entity2 editorial guidelines and making a general point about the nuances of broadcasting internationally			1
’ the @entity2 's exhaustive editorial guidelines run over 215 pages and contains guidance on all areas of its coverage including violence , swearing and nudity			1
and it appears that @entity1 , who runs @entity2 and said the term ' terrorist ' was too ' loaded ' to use , is just following orders			1
the @entity2 's guidance says : ' we must report acts of terror quickly , accurately , fully and responsibly			1
terrorism is a difficult and emotive subject with significant political overtones and care is required in the use of language that carries value judgements			0
' we try to avoid the use of the term " terrorist " without attribution			0
when we do use the term we should strive to do so with consistency in the stories we report across all our services and in a way that does not undermine our reputation for objectivity and accuracy			0
' the word " terrorist " itself can be a barrier rather than an aid to understanding			1
we should convey to our audience the full consequences of the act by describing what happened			0
' we should use words which specifically describe the perpetrator such as " bomber " , " attacker " , " gunman " , " kidnapper " , " insurgent " , and " militant "			0
we should not adopt other people 's language as our own ; our responsibility is to remain objective and report in ways that enable our audiences to make their own assessments about who is doing what to whom ' .			0

head of @entity238 says term ' terrorist ' is too ' loaded ' to use
@entity242 's own guidance also states the word is considered ' a barrier '
@entity9 and @entity8 and accomplice @entity10 murdered *17*
the brothers killed 12 people in a massacre at the offices of @entity7
@entity10 murdered a policewoman and then four others in a kosher deli
peers and *mps* have branded @entity2 ' mad ' and *claimed* it has ' lost its sense '
