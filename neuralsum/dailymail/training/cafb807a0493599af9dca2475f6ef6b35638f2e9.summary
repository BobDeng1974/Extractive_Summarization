two men who laughed during a horrific ' gang rape ' of a drunken woman have had their sentences slashed after three senior judges ruled they were not ' dangerous '			1
@entity5 , 27 , of @entity6 , and @entity7 , 24 , of @entity8 , were jailed indeterminately after being convicted of assaulting the 24 - year - old in @entity6 last june			1
sitting at the @entity10 , @entity11 , mr @entity12 and mr @entity13 heard how the men ' came across ' the woman before taking her to a flat where @entity7 pinned her down while another man raped her			2
three appeal judges ruled there was ' insufficient evidence ' that @entity5 and @entity7 should be defined as ' dangerous ' after that , @entity7 raped her before @entity5 ' grabbed ' her and ' dragged ' her into a bedroom where he raped her , judges were told			1
but today , despite the evidence , they ruled at the @entity27 there was ' insufficient evidence ' that @entity5 and @entity7 should be defined as ' dangerous '			1
they said judge @entity30 had been wrong to decide that ' imprisonment for public protection ' was necessary and hand down a jail sentence which gave the men no automatic right of release			2
they allowed the men 's appeal against the imposition of an indeterminate sentence and instead handed each a 12 - year term			1
the court earlier heard how the woman had become separated from friends - when she was ' quite drunk ' - in the early hours after visiting a number of bars and clubs , the court heard			0
ordeal : the woman had become separated from friends - when she was ' quite drunk ' - in the early hours after visiting a number of bars and clubs in the centre of @entity6 , @entity55 ( pictured ) the judges were told that she ' came across ' @entity57 , @entity7 and a third man in the town centre and went to @entity5 's nearby flat with them			1
her next recollection was of waking up naked with the three men nearby before the horrific ordeal began			0
when it was over the woman left the flat before realising that she had left her phone behind			0
she was allowed back in			0
@entity5 then pinned her down and raped her again before ' pushing ' her out of the flat , judges heard			2
judges said the woman was found in a ' very distressed state ' shortly after she left the flat and police were called			0
mr @entity13 said that before ' imprisonment for the public protection ' could be imposed , courts had to be satisfied that there was a ' significant risk ' to the public of serious harm through the ' commission of further specified offences '			0
he added : ' there was insufficient evidence to justify the finding of dangerousness made and an imprisonment for public protection should not therefore have been imposed			2
' both men admitted rape at @entity91 in november 2011 .			0

@entity5 , 27 , and @entity7 , 24 , *repeatedly* raped the woman , 24 , in @entity6
but judges rule there was ' insufficient evidence ' that they should be defined as ' dangerous '
they allowed the men 's appeal against *original* indeterminate sentence and instead handed each a 12 - year term
