by @entity0 published : 15:47 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 15:56 est , 17 march 2013 instruction sheets used by astronauts @entity3 and @entity4 to make the first moon landing are expected to fetch an astronomical Â£ 60,000 at auction			1
the signed papers were part of @entity4 's own manual used while @entity3 piloted the @entity10 in 1969			1
a second by second account by @entity4 of the fraught final minutes as the module approached the lunar surface is also included in the sale			1
history in the making : instruction sheets used by @entity3 and @entity4 for the first moon landing one small step : @entity4 , left on the lunar surface , used the notes , right , while @entity3 piloted the module it reveals the first words spoken on the surface were by @entity4 , who said ' contact light ' to confirm touch down , and not @entity3 with his famous quote : ' one small step for man ... ' the primary guidance and navigation papers have computer procedures on how to perform the lunar lift - off to enable the pair to leave the @entity36			1
the papers would also have shown the astronauts how to lift off from the @entity36 in an emergency			2
@entity4 is selling the sheets after a change in the law last year paved the way for @entity45 astronauts to retain legal ownership of items they kept from their historic missions			1
the sheets will be sold by @entity51 auctioneers in @entity52 on march 25			1
a letter by @entity4 which accompanies the sheets tells just how dramatic the famous moon landing was			1
final frontier : @entity4 poses for a photograph by the @entity59 flag after landing on the @entity36 in 1969 star gazing : the @entity62 crew , @entity3 ( left ) , @entity4 ( right ) and @entity63 ( centre ) in the letter @entity4 describes the moment an alarm sounded as the astronauts were close to landing			1
the craft 's computer was loaded with so many tasks the alarm kept sounding - meaning the men were behind in the jobs they needed to do before they could safely land			2
auction : @entity4 is putting his papers up for sale @entity4 's letter states : ' the lunar landing was an experience i will always remember ... some eight minutes into our descent engine burn , we started our most challenging part of the landing - the approach phase sequence			1
' we were behind on flight tasks due to the distractions caused by the alarms			0
@entity3 was monitoring our instruments and the visual view out his window			0
' @entity3 's flying tasks suddenly became more complicated because the computer was sending us into a large crater containing and surrounded by boulders			2
' at about 500 feet above the lunar surface , @entity3 entered the commands to manually fly @entity10 to the lunar surface with computer support			2
' he slowed the descent rate to just a few feet per second and studied the surrounding terrain			0
' @entity3 asked me about our fuel status and i indicated we had eight per cent remaining			0
' i was then able to glance outside and began to understand why the landing sequence was taking longer than planned - the craters , rocks and boulders seemed to be everywhere			2
' @entity111 radioed we had ' 60 seconds ' of fuel remaining			0
then ' 30 seconds ' rang in our headsets			0
' @entity3 was almost to the surface when a haze of dust was kicked up by engine exhaust			0
he could not see the surface and had to locate something just above the dust cloud			0
moonraker : @entity4 walking on the surface of the @entity36 after climbing out of the @entity10 module man on the moon : historic moment as @entity3 's right foot leaves a print in the lunar soil ' finally @entity3 was able to see a rock that appeared fixed in the stream of dust			1
this gave him a surface reference			0
' just as @entity3 placed @entity10 gently on the lunar surface , i spoke the first words from the @entity36 : ' @entity138 ! ' this was the indicator light on our control panel that told us that @entity10 had touched the lunar surface			1
to boldly go : the @entity62 mission sets off from the @entity144 in @entity145 ' we only had about 20 seconds of fuel remaining onboard			0
' @entity4 and @entity3 were joined on the mission by @entity63 , who orbited the @entity36 in the command spacecraft while they made their way to the surface			1
@entity153 , specialist in space history at @entity51 , said : ' @entity62 is pretty much the high point of the @entity59 space programme and the highlight of space exploration full stop as it was the first manned lunar landing			1
' these documents have been to the @entity36 and back are the equivalent of @entity161 's logbook			0
' they might appeal to an institution but this market is very much dominated by private collectors			0
' the cards are pretty technical so having the letter from @entity4 with them is the icing on the cake as it helps explain just how relevant the cards were			2
' the key points are the printed text about the powered ascent , when they come back from the surface of the @entity36 after becoming the first people to step on it			0
' they would have been getting instructions from @entity111 throughout , hence the annotations			0
