by @entity0 they are too young to walk and talk but tiny twins @entity2 and @entity3 can swim a length of a 25 - metre pool at just nine months old			1
the water babies love gliding up and down on their backs , kicking their legs to propel themselves along			0
and as this delightful underwater picture shows , they even smile while they ’re swimming			2
the twins ’ extraordinary talent emerged during a family holiday to @entity26 in october when they began to swim underwater , unaided and without armbands			2
on their return to @entity34 , @entity35 , their mother @entity31 , 35 , took them to local baby pool at the @entity38 where they both suddenly set off on their backs			1
first they did five metres , then a width at seven metres , and then a length of 12 metres , ’ said @entity41 - born mrs @entity3 , a former swimming coach			1
‘ there was hardly anyone in the adult pool , so i suggested to their teacher that we try the big pool			2
‘ they were loving it so much , they set off and did an entire length with me swimming underneath them on my back to make sure they were alright and to steer if they went off in the wrong direction			2
‘ @entity62 was first - she always is - and @entity2 seemed to be copying his big sister			1
under water fun : the pair first swam five metres before progressing to the full length of the pool natural : the twins now visit their local pool twice a week because they enjoy splashing around so much encouragement : former swimming coach @entity31 swims underneath her babies to check they are alright tired out : the babies take a well earned nap after their swimming exploits ‘ we were so excited - all the receptionists and swimming coaches came to watch and were amazed			1
‘ one of the coaches has been teaching for 20 years and she said she ’d never seen anything like it			0
‘ i think it comes naturally to them , as they are too young to actually learn the strokes			0
’ mr and mrs @entity3 , who are both youth workers , married in september 2008 and discovered they were expecting in july last year			1
it was only at their 12 week scan that they discovered they were having not one , but two			0
mr @entity95 , 49 , said : ‘ when i saw the two little dots on the screen it was just amazing			0
‘ i sank to my knees and shouted “ yes ! ” as if @entity100 had won the cup			0
‘ @entity102 do run in both families , but it was still a bit of a shock			0
’ there were more surprises in store for the family			0
while visiting her mother in @entity111 , @entity41 , mrs @entity3 was rushed to hospital with a placental abruption - each twin had their own placenta but @entity2 ’s had ruptured			1
in the family : the confidence in the water of mother @entity31 , a former swimming coach , and father @entity121 , helps @entity2 , centre left , and @entity3 , centre right they were born by emergency caesarean on 7 february , @entity3 first at five pounds ( 2.24kg ) and then @entity2 at four - and - half pounds ( 2.07kg )			1
@entity2 had swallowed a large amount of blood , which had to be sucked out his stomach , and was severely jaundiced			1
‘ it was a very traumatic birth and @entity2 nearly died , ’ said mrs @entity3			1
‘ they were in incubators for three weeks but i was just so relieved they were going to be ok			0
‘ they were so premature and small that although i ’d intended to take them swimming as soon as possible , i was worried they would get too cold in the water			2
‘ so we waited until they ’d had their inoculations and until they were big enough to regulate their temperature better			0
’ now aged ten months , the twins go swimming twice a week - to their @entity145 lesson with teacher @entity146 , and a practice session on the weekend			1
miss @entity146 , 27 , said : ‘ they are the youngest children i ’ve ever seen swim			0
‘ normally children can swim at age three or four at the earliest			2
‘ a lot of babies can hang in the water , but @entity62 and @entity2 can swim on top of the water and breathe independently			1
‘ it ’s remarkable how they can do it , but they have n’t learnt , it just comes naturally			0
‘ they are so relaxed because @entity161 and @entity162 are so relaxed in the water and love swimming			2
it rubs off on them			0
’ mr @entity95 now has half an eye on the @entity167 , having taken the twins to @entity169 this summer			1
‘ we wo n’t push them but it would be amazing to see them at the @entity174			0
‘ if they continue like this , who knows			0
' on dry land : father @entity121 hopes @entity3 , left , and @entity2 , right , compete at the @entity167 in 2028			1

tiny twins @entity2 and @entity3 surprised everyone at the pool by swimming so far
mother @entity184 , a former swimming coach , said the distance is ' astonishing ' for their age
father @entity121 already has one eye on the @entity167 and hopes they compete in 2028
