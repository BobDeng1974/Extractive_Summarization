by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 14 june 2013 hospital bosses have admitted responsibility for the death of a newborn baby following an ‘ appalling catalogue of failings ’ by midwives			1

@entity8 and @entity10 's first child , @entity11 , died of brain damage caused by oxygen starvation at @entity15 's @entity14			1
midwives struggled to find the baby 's heartbeat but it took two hours for ms @entity8 to be sent for an emergency c - section			1
the couple are pictured with a memory box they created investigators found that ms @entity8 was not reviewed by a consultant - despite her pregnancy being considered high risk because of complications during previous pregnancies			1
they also discovered that midwives failed to request additional help when the maternity unit became busy and that the couple were not provided with somewhere quiet to grieve after their baby ’s death			2
the couple have now secured a full admission of responsibility and official apology from @entity46 after taking legal action			0
they have also received an undisclosed payout , which will be used to have treatment for depression			0
ms @entity8 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , was admitted to the @entity14 on october 1 , 2010 , so she could be monitored closely after suffering repeated heavy bleeding			1
at 7.15am on october 3 , midwives struggled to find a strong heartbeat for @entity11 , yet it took more than two hours for staff to transfer ms @entity8 to theatre for a more detailed scan and potential caesarean section			1
doctors spent 20 minutes trying to resuscitate @entity11 after his birth but they were unable to save him			2
ied , despite staff trying to resuscitate him for 20 minutes @entity11 was eventually delivered at 9.39am with no signs of life			2
he died , despite staff trying to resuscitate him for 20 minutes			0
ms @entity8 , who has two children aged six and 11 from a previous relationship , said : ‘ @entity11 was mine and @entity10 ’s first child together and we were so excited to welcome him into the family			1
‘ my other children could n’t wait to meet him and they made cards for him , so when @entity10 had to go back to our home and tell them they would n’t ever get to see him and i was poorly in hospital , it broke their hearts , too			0
‘ @entity10 and i knew something was wrong but despite begging for help , the midwives did nothing and just did n’t seem to care			0
i was losing so much blood i thought i was going to die			0
the couple say they are now too scared to try for another baby ‘ i do n’t remember the @entity93 and needed further surgery			0
several hours after the delivery a doctor came and told me that @entity11 had died while i was on my own			1
‘ the following day , @entity10 and i were allowed to go and say goodbye to @entity11			2
we both held him in our arms and sobbed			0
‘ even when i stayed in hospital to recover for three weeks , none of the nurses seemed to care about what we ’d been through and did n’t offer any support or counselling			0
’ she added : ‘ we were disgusted by the way we were treated and determined to get justice for @entity11			2
‘ we welcome the apology but nothing could bring him back or make up for the pain we continue to suffer			0
we ’re too scared to try for another baby because we ’ve lost faith in the country ’s maternity services			0
‘ we just hope more than anything that improvements on the ward have been made as it will give us a tiny piece of hope that @entity11 ’s death was not completely in vain			1
’ following the birth , ms @entity8 spent three weeks in hospital recovering from blood loss and further complications from surgery			2
she said : ‘ i ’m not the person i used to be			0
i have some good days , some bad days			0
’ a hospital spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity46 apologises for the failings in care given to @entity11 and his family			2
‘ @entity133 has admitted responsibility and offered a full apology to the family for @entity11 ’s death			1
‘ @entity133 is pleased a financial settlement has now been reached with his family and extends its condolences during what would continue to be a difficult time for @entity11 ’s family			0
’ @entity14 has admitted responsibility for @entity11 's death and has agreed an out - of - court settlement with his parents who say they need the money to pay for treatment for depression @entity150 of the law firm @entity151 , which represented the couple , said : ‘ this is a tragic case that has seen a young couple left devastated by the loss of their first child together			1
‘ what is clear is that midwives made an appalling catalogue of failings and ignored a number of clear signs that @entity8 should be rushed for an emergency caesarean to save @entity11 ’s life			1
‘ it ’s hard to comprehend why more was not done to investigate why @entity8 was in so much pain and losing so much blood , particularly given that staff were aware she was a high risk pregnancy ‘ the couple have understandably found it incredibly hard to accept what happened and need specialist support to help them come to terms with their loss			0
‘ we are pleased that a settlement has been reached to fund this but we are also keen to see proof that the @entity46 has learnt from the mistakes it made and made improvements to ensure the same tragedy can not happen again			0

@entity186 died of brain damage at @entity14 , @entity15
his mother , @entity8 , 31 , was admitted with heavy bleeding
when midwives struggled to find @entity11 's heartbeat , they took two hours to send her for an emergency c - section , *meaning* he was starved of oxygen
hospital has admitted responsibility for his death and paid *compensation*
