a daughter is set to spend her first @entity1 with her real father after 34 years apart			1
@entity3 , 34 , grew up in @entity4 , @entity5 , with her two sisters , @entity7 , 31 , and @entity8 , 28 , believing another man was her father			1
it was only by chance at the age of 15 that she discovered the man she knew as dad was actually her step - father			1
reunited : claire with her biological father , @entity15 , who she did n't meet until she was 34 she explains : ' i had a very happy childhood with her mother and father but my view of who i was and where i came from changed completely when i was 15			1
' my sister found some paperwork in a cupboard by chance when she was tidying up			2
the documents showed that my name had been changed by deed poll when i was very little			2
we were mystified as to why that should have been the case			0
' when my mum arrived home , i confronted her about it and she told me my dad was not who i thought he was			2
' @entity38 , who she knew as her father and had brought her up in a loving and caring home , was actually her stepdad and her two sisters were really her half sisters			2
her mother , @entity44 , explained how she had met @entity3 's biological father , who called @entity46 , when she was 23 on a night out			1
he was from @entity47 but he had moved to @entity5 where he had opened an @entity49 diner			0
shock discovery : @entity3 was 15 when she found out she has been raised by her stepfather the couple had a relationship that resulted in @entity44 becoming pregnant with @entity3 but then they began to drift apart			1
@entity15 's father became unwell and so he moved back to @entity47 and after a few visits up to see his baby , he then lost contact with the family			1
@entity44 then met @entity38 when @entity3 was two and they married and had their two other daughters			1
@entity44 decided not to tell @entity3 that @entity38 was n't her real father as she did n't want her to feel different or unhappy			1
on discovering the truth years later , @entity3 said she initially felt shocked and angry but then understood once her mother explained the situation and the decisions she had made			1
she said : ' i felt confused initially but just wanted to meet my dad and talk to him			0
i understood that both he and her mum had their reasons for the way things turned out so i really just wanted to meet him , talk to him and see if he wanted to get to know me			0
' @entity3 constantly thought about her real father and tried to track him down but she did n't know where to start			1
years went by without any leads so she abandoned hope of ever finding him			2
@entity80 lost family : @entity3 , centre , with @entity15 , will spend @entity1 with her father and newly discovered half siblings - @entity84 and @entity86 , right , and @entity87 on the left she started up her own hairdressing business and had two children of her own , @entity91 and @entity92			1
then this summer , while watching @entity93 show @entity94 on tv , she was inspired to have another go at looking for @entity15			0
she started searching online and discovered the website , @entity98 , a professional @entity100 tracing agency who specialise in reunited long lost friends , family and beneficiaries			1
she did n't have much to go on other than her father 's name , date of birth and that he came from @entity47			2
she gave all this information to @entity98 not really expecting to hear any more			0
but after a week , she had a call from the company to say they had found him			0
he was living in @entity115 where he was married with grown up children			0
@entity3 said : ' i could n't believe it			1
i was quite nervous about calling him out of the blue but @entity98 was really helpful and supportive			0
they sent a letter on my behalf to him at his address in @entity115			0
' the letter arrived when my dad was on holiday in @entity127			0
his sister @entity128 , who was looking after the house for him while he was away , opened it			0
' @entity128 called me and we chatted and she told me about the family			2
i found out i had half brothers and a half sister that i did n't even know about			0
' my dad called when he got back from holiday and we were on the phone for hours talking and catching up			0
i 've been up to stay with him and his lovely wife and children for the weekend and we talk on the phone every other day			0
' i 'm so excited that for the first time ever i 'm going to see him for @entity1 this year			1
the best present i can imagine ! ' she added she feels lucky that she has now two fathers in her life .			0

@entity3 , 34 , grew up believing another man was her father
discovered age 15 she had been raised by her stepfather
@entity150 never told her she had lost touch with real father after she was born
@entity3 tried to find him but never had any luck
eventually tracked him down decades later thanks to tracing agency
now father and daughter will spend first @entity1 together in 34 years
