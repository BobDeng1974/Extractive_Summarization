president @entity0 used an executive order today to impose new sanctions on @entity3 today over its ' destructive , coercive cyber-related actions , ' including a hack on computers @entity8 last month			1
the sanctions affect three state - controlled @entity3 companies and 10 of its government officials , the @entity9 reports			1
@entity0 , still on vacation in @entity14 , notified @entity15 of his actions in a letter this afternoon			1
today he levied sanctions on the foreign government and 10 of its officials @entity0 promised at a press conference last month before departing for his annual holiday in the @entity21 that he would take ' proportional and appropriate ' actions to punish @entity3 for its attack on @entity8 's computers			1
@entity0 would not say whether sanctions were under consideration at that time or detail other possible retaliatory measures the @entity37 might take against @entity3 such as a cyber hack of its own , just that he was considering ' a range of options			1
' ' they caused a lot of damage , and we will respond , ' he said			0
' we will respond proportionally , and we ’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose			0
' it ’s not something that i will announce here today at a press conference , ' he added			0
days later @entity3 began experiencing massive , repeated internet outages			0
the @entity54 did not take credit for internet disruptions , which are believed to be the result of a hack , but it left the possibility open that the @entity37 could be involved			0
a spokesman for the @entity61 , @entity3 's military arm , later insisted that the @entity37 was behind the country 's internet failures and slurred @entity0			1
' @entity0 always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest , ' an unnamed official told the country 's state - run @entity70			1
today 's sanctions are the first government acknowledged actions against @entity3 for hack on @entity8 's computers and related threats of violence against movie theaters that showed a @entity82 @entity81 comedy film depicting the death of @entity3 leader @entity84			1
' as the president has said , our response to @entity3 's attack against @entity24 will be proportional , and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing , ' the @entity85 said in a statement			1
' today 's actions are the first aspect of our response			1
' @entity0 told @entity98 in a letter , ' i have now determined that that the provocative , destabilizing , and repressive actions and policies of the @entity103 , including its destructive , coercive cyber-related actions during november and december 2014 ... and commission of serious human rights abuses , constitute a continuing threat to the national security , foreign policy , and economy of the @entity37			2
' he noted that his executive order ' is not targeted at the people of @entity3 , but rather is aimed at the @entity103 and its activities that threaten the @entity37 and others			0
' @entity3 leader @entity84 delivers a @entity116 's address in this january 1 , 2015 in this photo released by @entity3 's @entity70			2
an unnamed official in @entity84 's government called @entity0 a ' monkey ' last week and accused the @entity37 of hacking the country 's internet as revenge for @entity8 the new sanctions build off of previous penalties levied on the foreign government by @entity0 in 2008 , 2010 and 2011			1
per @entity9 , sanctions were directed at @entity128 , @entity3 's primary intelligence organization , @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , the state 's arms dealer and @entity134 , defense research organization			2
@entity3 officials named include @entity131 representatives to @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 and the business ' external affair officers , as well as a @entity134 representative who operates out of @entity144 , @entity145			2
treasury secretary @entity146 said the sanctions were ' driven by our commitment to hold @entity3 accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct			0
' even as the @entity152 continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against @entity24 , these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend @entity37 businesses and citizens , and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the @entity37 , ' he said today			0
@entity163 sen. @entity162 , the ranking member of the @entity164 , said the @entity0 administration 's decision ' sends a message to @entity3 and others that the @entity37 will not tolerate illicit activities , including cyber attacks			2
' ' it ’s time to acknowledge that our current @entity3 policy is not working , and that we must develop a more proactive strategy across the board to respond to growing threats from @entity3 , including its cyber activities as well as its weapons of mass destruction programs , ' the @entity172 lawmaker said			0
@entity183 chairman @entity182 also said he did not think the penalties on @entity3 were stiff enough			0
' it ’s good to see the @entity186 challenging @entity3 ’s latest aggression - cyberattacks that can do grave damage			0
but many of the @entity3 blacklisted today have already been targeted by @entity37 sanctions , ' the @entity189 @entity163 said			2
' we need to go further to sanction those financial institutions in @entity194 and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous @entity3 regime , as was done in 2005			0
' my comprehensive legislation that the @entity85 passed last year would give the @entity186 the tools to do just that , ' he said			0
the @entity85 has said several times since the @entity8 hack that it would like to see @entity15 pass new cyber security legislation and it would support those efforts .			1
