pleading exceptional hardship , @entity2 said : ‘ my daughter is at @entity6			1

she is in her second year now			0
the third year intention was we would take over the payments			0

i am very worried that my daughter would have to move school			1
‘ she seems very happy and settled			0
financially things would be very difficult			0
it would almost certainly be impossible			0
’ @entity2 said he and his wife @entity51 , 46 , had separated nearly a year ago and he told the court he did not want to add any more disruption to his daughter ’s life by moving school			1
mrs @entity57 , who part - owns a chain of day nurseries , said : ‘ it would impact on his ability to pay school fees , which would put the burden of that onto me			2

if that ’s what i had to do , that would be what i had to do			0
’ @entity2 , who runs vinyl record store @entity76 in @entity79 ’s @entity78 and an online business , also claimed he would be forced to pay off staff if he was banned			1

he begged a judge to let him keep his licence so he could look for work as a mobile tyre fitter			2
a mistake by the court meant the judge was unaware of @entity117 ’s previous offences – and that he should already have been banned			2
