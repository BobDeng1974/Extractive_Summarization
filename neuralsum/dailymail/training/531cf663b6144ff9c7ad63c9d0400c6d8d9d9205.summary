by @entity0 published : 13:53 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 13:53 est , 29 january 2014 ruling : high court judge mr @entity2 has given doctors authority to carry out a caesarean section on a 25 - year - old pregnant woman who is suffering ' a profound psychotic episode ' a high court judge has given doctors authority to carry out a caesarean section on a pregnant woman who is suffering ' a profound psychotic episode '			1
the judge allowed an urgent application by the @entity16 for permission to carry out ' serious medical treatment ' on the 25 - year - old , who is pregnant with her first child and has a history of affective bipolar disorder			1
doctors had asked that the caesarian section be performed after a rupture of the amniotic sac , putting both the mother and her child at risk of infection			1
ordinarily in such circumstances doctors would induce labour , however , the woman had been unable to take all of her anti-psychotic medication due to her pregnancy , and had become ' highly agitated '			1
medics believed she would be unable to co-operate should she be induced			1
mr @entity2 also ruled it would be lawful and in the woman ’s ' best interests ' for hospital staff to ensure she does not leave the hospital at any stage until it is ' clinically appropriate ' for her to be discharged			1
he directed that any physical restraint or force used on her should be the minimum necessary , and all reasonable steps should be taken to minimise her distress and ensure she retains ' the greatest dignity possible in all the circumstances '			0
mr @entity2 , sitting in the @entity53 of the @entity53 in @entity54 , said the woman , who can only be named as ' aa ' for legal reasons , and her partner welcomed the pregnancy and they plainly had the support of her parents			0
in a ruling on tuesday , the judge said @entity64 was now at 38 weeks gestation but appeared unable ' to comprehend any aspect of her treatment '			1
she had been prescribed ' a battery of anti-psychotic medication ' for her bipolar condition , and also had a history of substance and alcohol abuse , most likely linked to efforts to self - medicate , particularly in the early days of her illness			0
the judge said @entity64 ’s father , who had been with her throughout her ' long journey ' of mental ill - health , had described her present condition as ' the worst he has seen '			0
the father told the court she was very agitated , ' violent and exhausted by lack of sleep '			2
on january 29 , @entity64 appeared at the @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , confused and disorientated after a suspected seizure			2
she was admitted to the hospital ’s labour suite although , at the time of the @entity53 hearing , she had not gone into labour			2
the day after arriving at the hospital , she was detained under the @entity98 and remained ' highly agitated and largely unco - operative with almost every aspect of her obstetric care '			1
because of her pregnancy , it was not possible to administer her full range of anti-psychotic medication or the required dose			0
application : doctors at the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , had the backing of the woman 's family to carry out the caesarian , with her father describing them as ' fantastic ' the judge said the dilemma for clinicians was that membranes , or amniotic sac had ruptured , giving rise to a significantly increased risk of both mother and unborn baby suffering infection before delivery			1
her medical team were entirely clear that she would be unable to co-operate should labour be induced and that it would be in her best interests and the safest option to perform an elective ( planned ) caesarean under general anaesthetic			1
her father said the doctors and nurses had been ' fantastic ' and he supported them ' 100 per cent '			2
he had told the court his daughter had already moved intravenous lines on more than one occasion , the judge said			0
on the night before the court hearing , @entity64 had become more distressed			0
she had run at a window and tried to get out , telling her father ' she wanted to go to heaven '			0
the judge said @entity64 ’s partner was in difficult circumstances and not always consistent or logical , but he believed he was saying that if @entity64 ' were not suffering this profound psychotic episode ... she would follow the recommendation of the doctors '			0
the judge ruled : ' in all the circumstances , therefore , it is perfectly clear that @entity64 , at the moment , lacks capacity to take these crucial decisions , and that the case made by the @entity16 for elective caesarean is , as the official solicitor ( appointed to safeguard @entity64 ’s best interests ) observed , compelling			0
' for the avoidance of doubt the official solicitor has supported every aspect of the @entity16 ’s case			2

doctors asked that the caesarian section be performed after the mother 's amniotic sac ruptured , putting both her and her baby at risk of infection
woman unable to take all of her medication and had ' become agitated '
medics felt she would not be able to co-operate if labour was induced
@entity177 said woman was ' unable to comprehend any aspect of her treatment '
the @entity16 in @entity88 was granted permission to carry out the ' serious ' medical treatment
her father described hospital staff as ' fantastic ' , and gave them his backing
