by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:01 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 09:41 est , 1 july 2012 this is not a good time to be a duck with a fatty liver in @entity6 , though better times lie just ahead			2
chefs are loading their high - end menus with duck liver : terrine de foie gras , seared foie gras with mango chutney , foie gras salad and sweet foie gras for dessert			1
and they are keeping secret the locations of their multi-course dinners to avoid protesters as a july 1 ban looms in @entity6 , the only state to outlaw foie gras			1
' the price has doubled			0
people are finding it hard to get it because the demand is so high , ' said @entity50 of the @entity52 - based traveling dining service @entity53 , which has organized a series of 15 secret , sold - out foie gras dinners			1
her last one is thursday			0
while gourmands stockpile foie gras at $ 60 a pound , others are stomaching the frenetic food fest with disdain			1
' high - end foodies and chefs stuffing down their throats excessive amounts of fatty liver from force - fed ducks in the run - up to the ban paint a pretty ironic picture , ' said @entity74 of the @entity75			1
as the @entity6 foie gras feeding frenzy escalates , protesters in @entity79 and @entity80 are staking out restaurants and even making reservations to tie up seats at dinners they know they 'll never attend			1
' many people do n't know what foie gras is or how it 's produced and they 're horrified when we tell them , ' said @entity88 , who shot undercover video inside a foie gras operation and organizes the @entity79 - area protests			1
' prep work : chef and owner @entity93 , right , prepares a foie gras dish at @entity31 ; renegade chefs across the state are loading their menus with the fatty duck liver @entity100 : guests enjoy a foie gras dish at the restaurant delicious dish : the food will be banned because of the cruel way in which foie gras must be prepared occasionally we 'll run into antagonistic patrons , but that 's usually when we 're protesting at the foie gras benefit dinners			1
' it 's why @entity114 does n't publicize the restaurants where her dinners will be held until a day before the date			0
' so far we have n't had any protesters , which has been nice , ' she said			0
the @entity6 legislature gave the state 's only producer , @entity125 , more than seven years to come up with a cruelty - free way to fatten the duck 's liver when in 2004 it voted in the ban on producing and selling foie gras			1
absent that , a coalition of chefs have mounted a lobbying campaign to try to overturn the law in the future , and the foie gras dinners are funding that on - going effort			1
force - fed : a farmer in @entity141 force feeds grain to a duck as part of the traditional process to fatten its liver for foie gras a mallard of life and death : geese wait for their midday feed where they are force - fed to enlarge their livers ; @entity154 and the @entity155 have banned the practice to the oohs and aaahs of about 30 diners , chef @entity93 hosted a recent seven - course foie gras feast at his @entity31 restaurant in @entity163			2
he started with arugula with foie gras vinaigrette , moved to foie gras mousse with tartufata and @entity169 peas and seared foie gras with savoury rhubarb pie			2
for dessert : foie , peanut butter and chocolate			0
foie gras - @entity177 for ' fatty liver ' - is made from liver swollen to 10 times its normal size , which the lawsuit argues is acute hepatic lipidosis , a condition linked to obesity in animals			2
@entity187 ' livers become so engorged by the feeding process called ' gavage ' that the birds ca n't walk and have trouble breathing			0
@entity192 has been outlawed in a dozen countries including @entity154 , the @entity155 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and the @entity197			0
' for me , it was more of an educational dinner to talk a little about how foie gras is produced and the science behind how it 's produced , ' @entity93 said			2
' yes there are two sides to it , but understanding the line between science and emotion is very important for people			0
' there are enough ' quality ingredients out there ' that his @entity6 - @entity177 menu wo n't be lacking when it 's gone , @entity93 said			0
as someone who goes to extreme measures to source quality meat and vegetables , he thinks animal welfare advocates could end more suffering if they 'd focus on practices at large confined animal farming operations producing beef , chicken and pork			0
' i think the issue that the animal rights people have is a lot bigger than foie gras , ' @entity93 said			2
' @entity32 was sort of an easy target , sort of low - hanging fruit			0
' but in the sense of improving conditions of animal welfare , ending some of the factory farming practices that big ag is defending is a very admirable goal			0
' the @entity6 ban , which maintains that over-feeding ducks using a pipe stuffed down the esophagus is cruel , comes as four animal welfare groups filed a lawsuit against the @entity245 @entity244 last month , making another point about foie gras			1
they hope to secure a national prohibition by arguing that @entity244 is violating the @entity250 by allowing ' diseased birds ' to enter the food chain			0
video : @entity6 restaurants serve an abundance of foie gras ahead of ban .			1

@entity45 to ban foie gras on july 1 , and will be only state to do so
@entity262 states that over-feeding of ducks via tubes is cruel
ahead of ban , high - end restaurants serving abundance of *decadent* food
