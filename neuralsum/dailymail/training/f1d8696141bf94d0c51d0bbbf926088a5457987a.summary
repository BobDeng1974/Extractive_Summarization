by @entity0 published : 03:09 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 04:57 est , 21 september 2012 the private company at the centre of the @entity5 security shambles should be blacklisted by the government and stripped of its £ 57million taxpayer - funded management fee , mps have said			1
@entity8 must also pay those people it trained but then failed to use due to management failings during its disastrous attempt to protect the public and venues at @entity15 , according to an influential commons committee			1
the blame for the debacle , which saw thousands of troops brought in at the last minute to help secure the @entity20 , lies ' firmly and solely ' with @entity8 , a damning report has found			1
it was promised £ 57million of taxpayers ' money for a ' management fee ' - which the company claims it needs to cover its costs			1
the firm , which has contracts with 10 central government departments and agencies and 14 police forces in @entity48 and @entity49 , was contracted to train and accredit 10,400 staff and manage 13,000 others - but failed			0
exonerating @entity5 organisers @entity53 , the @entity54 and everybody else , the @entity52 said even @entity8 agreed it was the only one at fault			2
the firm , which has already taken a £ 50 million loss on the @entity20 , must now ' look to the bigger picture , and its long - standing relationship with its biggest client in the @entity66 : the taxpayer ' , the committee ’s report said			1
' by waiving the £ 57 million management fee in its entirety , a small fraction of the £ 759 million that it receives from the @entity66 taxpayer every year , @entity8 would send a strong signal to the public that it is serious about offering fair and reasonable redress when things go badly wrong			1
' the move would help draw a line under its failure , it added			0
problems : the army was drafted in because the government could ' leave nothing to chance ' following security problems on patrol : armed forces patrol the @entity89 during the @entity20 new home : soldiers were temporarily housed in barracks in @entity93 , a former shopping centre in east @entity94 , as the government came to terms with the @entity8 security shortfall ' @entity98 and the general public would regard it as absurd for the company to be claiming a management fee which was clearly negotiated on the basis of the delivery of services which were not delivered			1
' the ' apparent reluctance ' of @entity8 chief executive @entity108 to grasp this point shocked the committee , the @entity106 added			1
they went on : ' the government should not be in the business of rewarding failure with taxpayers ’ money			0
' we recommend that the government establish a register of high - risk providers , who have a track - record of failure in the delivery of public services			0
aftermath : @entity8 chief executive , @entity108 , has been dragged in front of mps on several occasions to explain his company 's failings ' this would provide a single source of information for those conducting procurement exercises about companies which are failing or have failed in the delivery of public contracts			1
' in future , @entity117 departments , police forces and other public bodies ' must not place too much weight on a company ’s size and reputation alone ' , the report added			2
and people who were ready and willing to work but not offered a time and place to start should be paid for the training they attended , the @entity106 said			2
' we can understand a company wishing to recover costs if an individual benefits from training but then fails to turn up for work without good reason , but when the lack of shifts work is entirely due to the company ’s failure to provide employment , this is an entirely different matter			1
' we expect the company to make public a means by which people can be recompensed in such circumstances and to be quick and generous in settling such claims			0
' some 4,700 extra servicemen and women were drafted in at the last minute , taking the military ’s contribution to 18,200 personnel , and more police were needed to boost venue security too			0
the day after the @entity5 closing ceremony , august 13 , was the first date on which the number of staff supplied by @entity8 met @entity53 ’s demand , the report found			1
a @entity185 spokeswoman said : ' since day one this government has been determined to reform how we spend taxpayers ’ money on goods and services			0
' that ’s why we have introduced unprecedented and comprehensive reforms across all areas of procurement			0
' in june we announced that - like many businesses - we will take the performance history of our suppliers into account during the procurement process			0
' while we will not publicly name the companies involved it will mean that suppliers with poor performance may find it more difficult to secure work with government in future			0
” @entity210 , chief executive of the @entity211 ’ @entity209 , said : ' the @entity52 is absolutely right to say that the government must never use taxpayers ’ money to reward failure			0
' it is vital that @entity8 pays the price for its mistakes whilst ministers must ensure that not a single penny of taxpayers ’ money is used to clear up the mess @entity8 caused			2
' shadow home secretary @entity224 said the report showed ' the huge scale of @entity8 ’s failure and how the company seemed willing to dupe the home secretary about the numbers they could provide '			1
“ but the government also needs to show it has learnt lessons from @entity8 and the @entity5			2
' a @entity8 spokesman said the firm 's board and management took ' responsibility for the inability of the company to deliver , in full , on the @entity5 security contract and apologise for this failure '			1
findings of a review into what went wrong will be announced within the next 10 days , he added			0
the firm has also ' consistently made clear that the @entity66 taxpayer will not bear any additional costs '			0
' as explained by both @entity8 and @entity53 to the committee , the £ 57 million ' management fee ' is not a profit , ' he added			1
' it relates substantially to real costs which have been incurred such as wages , property and it expenditure			0
the final financial settlement is currently under discussion with @entity53			0
' he added the firm has ' agreed a process , in conjunction with the @entity262 union , for compensating those candidates who completed training and accreditation or made a significant journey through the recruitment process , but were unable to work at the @entity20 '			2
he went on : ' @entity8 has a long - standing track record of delivering on government contracts to a consistently high standard			0
' everyone connected with the company is extremely disappointed that @entity8 was unable to deliver on its full commitments on this contract , but this does not reflect the high standards @entity8 delivers continuously in its other work for the @entity117 every day			2
' video : @entity8 in charge of @entity5 security fiasco should lose £ 57m			1

@entity8 admitted it could provide 10,400 guards only two weeks before @entity20
report by @entity106 says blame for debacle ' lies only with them '
they should give up £ 57m management fee after its security flop , they say
*beleaguered* company says it needs the cash to cover its costs
