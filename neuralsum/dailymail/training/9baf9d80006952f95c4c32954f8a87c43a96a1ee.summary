by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:03 pm on 3rd february 2012 @entity3 's sporting heroes should wear the @entity5 flag on their national team shirts under contentious plans passed by the @entity8 yesterday			1
the measures stipulate that the @entity5 's blue and yellow flag should be worn by all our teams - including football , rugby , cricket and the @entity3 @entity17 team			1
the @entity5 flag should also be flown at major @entity3 sporting events such as the @entity19 , the @entity21 series , @entity22 and the @entity3 @entity23			1
flag bearer : @entity26 star @entity25 could be forced to wear the @entity28 stars on his @entity26 shirt ... which could look like our mocked - up image , right to be flown : @entity3 's sporting heroes should wear the @entity5 flag on their national team shirts under plans passed by the @entity8 yesterday following an outcry , @entity34 have acknowledged that the measure should not be compulsory and individual member states will be given the final say over whether to display the flag			1
the idea is contained in a report on ' the @entity42 ' which was overwhelmingly approved by @entity34 yesterday			0
the recommendations will now be considered by the @entity44			0
@entity45 @entity34 have furiously fought the proposals arguing that they are the latest example of @entity48 attempting to impose itself on @entity3 's way of life			1
the report suggests ' that the @entity28 flag should be flown at major international sports events held on the @entity5 territory '			1
it adds that sports should ' consider the idea of having it displayed on the clothing of athletes from @entity62 , alongside with the national flags ; underlines that it should be entirely voluntary and up to @entity62 and sports organisations to decide whether they will use the aforementioned options			0
' argument : @entity69 demands to wear a poppy on shirts led to @entity72 allowing this armband to be worn in november the report also seeks to bar sports agents from operating anywhere in the @entity5 unless they pay taxes there , a move likely to starve many top @entity3 sides of overseas talent , especially in cricket and rugby			1
@entity48 already has the power to fine organisations in certain circumstances for not flying the @entity5 flag			2
recently , it emerged that the @entity88 was fined more than Â£ 56,000 for not displaying the @entity5 logo to acknowledge it had received funding from the @entity91			0
@entity92 , @entity45 spokesman on culture , education and sport in the @entity8 , said the proposal was ' outrageous and unnecessary '			0
' @entity97 has a special place in my country , and our national teams form a key part of our identities and heritage , ' she told the parliament			2
' the @entity5 can not impose an artificial @entity28 identity on us by forcing our athletes to wear its emblem			0
' bright idea : members of the @entity8 attend a debate she added : ' the report also calls for any agent representing a sportsperson who plays in @entity28 to have their fiscal residence in the @entity5 ; despite the fact that many players are not @entity28 and many sportspeople themselves have their fiscal residence outside the @entity5			0
' @entity125 and legal frameworks operating at national level should be left alone - it is up to each member state and the sport governing bodies to decide how they run their national sports			2
' other major proposals in the report include a call on national governments to make trafficking of performance - enhancing drugs illegal and the creation of a @entity28 database of hooligans .			0
