by @entity0 no man is happy without an instruction manual , be it for a widescreen tv or a @entity6 drill			1
and the heir to the throne is apparently no exception			2
prince @entity10 – ever the military man – is preparing for impending fatherhood with a no - nonsense guide by former commando and father - of - three @entity14			1
the @entity10 is working his way through @entity16 – @entity17 , a handbook in the style of @entity20 , the @entity22 bible given to new recruits			1
no - nonsense : @entity0 puts the book to the test with 11 - month - old @entity26 described by the author as ‘ accessible basic training for dads ’ , the book uses military terminology throughout			1
babies are referred to as @entity33 ( baby troopers ) , toddlers as @entity36 ( mobile troopers )			0
home is referred to as ‘ @entity39 ’ , the emptying of dirty nappies as ‘ @entity42 ’ and holidays are ‘ long - term major deployments ’			0
armed with the tome , i ‘ borrowed ’ my neighbours ’ 11 - month - old son @entity26 to put the advice to the test			0
the training is certainly basic : @entity52 à la @entity51			2
but the @entity10 , who admits he has never changed a nappy , will no doubt have absorbed the fail - safe , ten - point plan , which sits neatly in a chapter entitled @entity57 : surviving the first 24 hours , accompanied by four illustrations			2
@entity22 training : prince @entity10 , a military man , looked macho showing off to the @entity61 this week relaxed father - to - be : prince @entity10 seems at ease with his forthcoming responsibilities , seen laughing with the @entity61 and prince @entity65 this week at the making of @entity67 tour @entity26 and i just about got through it , though i had entirely forgotten that boys invariably wee in your eye			1
chapter 12 meanwhile is , frankly , frightening			0
dealing with hostilities explores such tricky subjects as ‘ establishing boundaries ’ , ‘ unit regulations ’ and ‘ age - appropriate sanctions ’			0
i read all this aloud to @entity26 , who promptly responded by taking off his beret and jabbing me in the eye with a sticky finger .			0
