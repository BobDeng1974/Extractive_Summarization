by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 13:30 est , 26 april 2012 @entity2 converted to @entity3 in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago , socialite @entity1 claimed today			1
the maverick mp took part in a ' shahadah ' conversion , attended by members of the @entity9 of @entity10 , she said			2
@entity1 , who herself became a @entity9 ahead of her failed marriage to cricketer @entity13 , claimed she knows someone who attended the event in north - west @entity16 in an article in the @entity19 magazine			1
but mr @entity2 , who was elected to @entity20 as mp for @entity21 in a by - election last month , angrily denied that any ceremony had taken place			1
war of words : @entity1 , right , wrote that @entity2 , right , converted to @entity3 in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago			2
he has denied ever taking part in such a ceremony however , the four times married 57 - year - old refused to deny claims that he is a @entity9			1
in the media , mr @entity2 has always been widely referred to as a @entity34			1
in the days before his shock landslide by - election victory last month , a letter - which mr @entity2 denies being behind - went out to voters highlighting his record of support for @entity40 , his work for ' the freedom of @entity43 ' and his abstention from alcohol			1
it added : ' @entity47 knows who is a muslim			0
and he knows who is not			0
' elected : @entity21 mp @entity2 takes his seat in the @entity52 earlier this month for the first time after winning a by - election ms @entity1 , who interviewed the mp in his new constituency , which has a large @entity9 community , started the article : ' @entity2 , mp for @entity21 , is a @entity9			1
' he converted more than ten years ago in a ceremony at a hotel in @entity60 , north - west @entity16 , attended by members of the @entity9 of @entity10			2
' those close to him know this			0
the rest of the world , including his @entity9 constituents , does not			0
' claims : @entity1 's allegations were published in the @entity19 magazine today ms @entity1 tells mr @entity2 she knows someone ' who attended your shahadah ' and says , ' so you converted ? ' according to the article he replied : ' i ca n't answer that			1
@entity47 knows who is a muslim			0
' the interview was carried out as ms @entity1 and mr @entity2 ate a halal meal			1
when being sworn in as an mp mr @entity2 chose to affirm , rather than make the pledge on a religious text			2
he told ms @entity1 : ' people ask me this , why did i affirm in @entity20 when i swore in ? ' the answer is : i had to take an oath of allegiance in which i do n't believe , to the queen and all her heirs and successors , and i have no allegiance to any of them , and i could not possibly swear such a thing on a holy book			2
' so nothing else should be read into the affirmation			0
' mr @entity2 claimed today the article was littered with ' deliberate falsehoods ' and ' schoolgirl howlers '			1
he tweeted : ' no such ceremony ever happened , in @entity60 or anywhere else			0
' in a statement he added : ' the opening paragraph of @entity1 's piece in the @entity19 , referring to an alleged conversion ceremony , is totally untrue			2
' moreover i told her it was fallacious when she put it to me			0
i have never attended any such ceremony in @entity60 , @entity112 or @entity113			0
' it is simply and categorically untrue			0
' the @entity19 issued a robust statement in response to mr @entity2 's denial			2
a spokeswoman said : ' it is notable that @entity2 does not deny being a @entity9 convert - and he did not deny it when it was put to him at the time of the interview , which is on tape			1
' contrary to his press release , nor did he deny that the ceremony took place when it was put to him during the interview			0
this is also on tape			0
' furthermore , he failed to clarify how , by his own admission , he had a ' nikah ' ( a @entity9 marriage ceremony ) , despite the fact that a @entity133 man can not marry a @entity9 woman under @entity3 law			0
' confusion : @entity2 , pictured outside the @entity137 with his new wife @entity138 , has denied taking part in a @entity9 conversion ceremony - but apparently not denied being a @entity9			1

@entity2 denies taking part in the ceremony - but does n't deny being a @entity9
he says article written by @entity1 is littered with ' schoolgirl howlers '
*politician* has always been referred to as @entity34
interview carried out as mr @entity2 ate a halal meal
