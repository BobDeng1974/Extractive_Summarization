by @entity0 one in three families in @entity3 would survive for less than a week if they lost their job , a damning study reveals today			2
around 8.8million households in this country ‘ only have £ 250 or less ’ set aside as a financial safety net , which would protect the average family for just five days , according to the report			1
in a further blow , the number of struggling families has reached a record high as bills rise relentlessly , but their pay has barely changed for five years			1
a damning new study by banking giant @entity16 has revealed one in three families would n't last a week on their savings			1
it found 8.8million of the country 's 26million households have £ 250 or less set aside as a financial safety net ( stock image ) the report , from the banking giant @entity16 , found 34 per cent of families have £ 250 or less of ‘ accessible ’ savings , such as money in their current account , tax - free isas and savings accounts			1
this is the highest figure recorded by @entity16 , which has conducted the same piece of research every year for the last four years			2
in 2010 , the figure was 30 per cent , falling to 28 per cent in 2011 , rising again to 31 per cent last year and reaching an all - time high of 34 per cent this year			2
over the last year alone , it estimates around 800,000 families have been caught in the trap of having either no safety net or one that would last for just a few days if disaster struck			0
to make matters worse , the most common answer given by these families is that they have no savings at all			2
of the 34 per cent who have £ 250 or less , the report says this comprises of 25 per cent with ‘ no savings ’ while a further 9 per cent have some cash set aside			1
the average family needs just under £ 50 a day to survive , according to the report			1
the study shows the number of families struggling has reached a record high as the cost of living continues to rise ( stock image ) this is money needed to cover all their typical outgoings from food to electricity , council tax to water , transport costs to gas			1
for many families , it is not just losing their job which would cause a problem			0
others might be tipped over the edge by losing a shift or over-time pay , becoming too ill to continue to work full - time or having an unexpected bill to pay			0
on average , @entity16 said the average person has a savings pot of £ 14,400 , which would last for just over nine months based on an average monthly expenditure of £ 1,500			1
however , there is a significant gender divide , with 29 per cent of women having no ‘ accessible ’ savings compared to only 19 per cent of men			0
it comes as official figures showed inflation dropped sharply last month , but prices are still rising three times faster than the average worker ’s pay			0
the figures , from the @entity94 , show the consumer prices index measure of inflation fell from 2.7 per cent in september to 2.2 per cent in october			0
the prime minister hailed the ‘ significant drop ’ , which brings down inflation to the lowest annual rate since last september , and said it is ‘ encouraging news for hard - working people ’			0
but the fall in inflation comes amid a backdrop of crippling increases in energy bills , paltry pay rises of just 0.7 per cent and rising food bills up by 4.3 per cent over the last 12 months			0
to add to the pressure on families , inflation has been above the government ’s target of two per cent for four years during a time when pay rises have been below inflation throughout			0
the @entity16 report was based on survey of 2,035 people in the @entity3 aged 18 and over .			2
