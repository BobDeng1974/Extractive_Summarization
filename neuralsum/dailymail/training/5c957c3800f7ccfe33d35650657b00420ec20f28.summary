nos 50 - 41 : includes @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2			1
the centre forward : the leader from the front , the @entity7 9 , the provider , the talisman , the goalscorer			0
since 1992 , the @entity9 has been blessed with the best , from homegrown talents @entity10 and @entity12 , to foreign imports @entity14 and @entity15 , but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments			2
whether failing to justify their huge price tag , or just incapable of hitting a barn door , there have been some dreadful forwards in @entity24 's top flight			2
as we build - up to the return of the @entity9 following the international break , @entity25 runs you through @entity29 40 - 31 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division ... do you agree ? 40 ) @entity32 ( @entity33 ) @entity32 went on to win the @entity34 and @entity35 with @entity36 , the @entity37 and @entity38 with @entity39 and the @entity40 with @entity41 - yet the @entity42 was utterly hopeless during his season at @entity33			1
arriving as a fresh - faced 21 - year - old in 1997 for £ 2.2million from @entity44 , @entity32 simply was not strong enough to cope with the @entity9 and found himself bullied by opposition defenders			1
he was shifted forward to the striker position from his preferred attacking midfield role due to an injury to @entity10 and managed just three goals in 23 league appearances for the @entity51			0
@entity33 fans are still to this day bemused as to how @entity32 scored 52 goals in 112 games for @entity55 - because his talent certainly went missing when he was on @entity57			1
@entity32 signed for @entity33 in 1997 but struggled to adapt to the pace and power of the @entity9 the @entity61 striker , pictured against @entity62 in the @entity34 in october 1997 , lasted just one year on @entity57 39 ) @entity63 ( @entity64 ) remembered fondly for singing and drinking with @entity64 fans in @entity68 before the 2001 @entity37 final , @entity66 's actual footballing ability is not reminisced about in quite such a positive manner			1
the @entity71 moved to @entity64 in 1999 on a free transfer having torn @entity40 defences to shreds in partnership with @entity76 at @entity77			0
though @entity66 himself physically upped sticks and moved to @entity24 , his form remained firmly in @entity81			0
no goals arrived during in 24 @entity9 games during his two - year stay on @entity85 and he was loaned out to @entity86 ( where he also failed to score ... ) before leaving for @entity87			1
well , at least he knew how to enjoy a pint anyway ... @entity63 ( centre ) signed for @entity64 from @entity77 on a free transfer in 1999 but failed to score a single @entity9 goal the @entity71 , holding his arms aloft against @entity93 ( left ) and @entity94 , did enjoy a drink with @entity64 fans in @entity68 though @entity96 signed for @entity97 wednesday from @entity98 in 1996 but scored just four goals in 16 @entity9 games 38 ) @entity96 ( @entity101 ) when you sign a striker who has just scored an incredible 37 goals in 47 games for @entity98 in a £ 2m deal , you expect to be getting a bit of a bargain			1
but @entity110 's spell in the @entity111 in 1996 was not one he will want to remember in a hurry			0
four goals did arrive in 16 @entity9 appearances , including two on his debut against @entity116 , but he departed less than six months after his arrival to head to @entity118 with @entity119			2
@entity96 was criticised for his poor heading ability , his poor first touch and lack of movement - but apart from that , @entity125 fans thought he was incredible ... 37 ) @entity127 ( @entity94 and @entity93 ) the @entity128 has 74 caps for his country - just let that sink in for a second			1
incredibly , @entity127 has scored everywhere he has been - except in @entity24			1
he netted 15 league goals for @entity134 and 39 for @entity135 - as well as bagging 24 international goals to date for the @entity128 - but has managed just two strikes in the @entity9			1
a season - long loan move to @entity94 in 2009 from @entity139 yielded just a solitary goal in 28 games during his first spell in @entity24 , but his second stint in the @entity9 was supposed to be the making of him			1
having recovered his form in @entity146 in blistering style , @entity127 was signed by @entity93 in 2013 for £ 6.5m but has netted just once in 33 league games since			2
sometimes @entity127 , things just are n't meant to be ... @entity127 was signed by @entity93 for £ 6.5m from @entity135 in 2013 but has struggled in the @entity9 despite being a prolific scorer for the @entity128 national team , @entity127 's record with @entity94 and @entity93 is appalling 36 ) @entity153 ( @entity154 ) @entity155 was considered a waste of money at @entity158 , but @entity153 arguably tops that			1
during their ill - fated relegation campaign last season , @entity154 splashed £ 12m on the @entity162 international in january in a bid to stave off the drop - but their investment proved to be a disastrous one			0
@entity153 had scored 41 league goals in 92 appearances for @entity170 but injuries plagued him during his time in west @entity173 and he managed just three @entity9 games for @entity154			2
instead of being their saviour , he turned in to their benchwarmer instead			0
he returned to the @entity180 champions on loan in august but it is safe to say @entity154 fans will not be worried if he does n't return			0
@entity153 signed for @entity154 in january for £ 12m from @entity180 side @entity170 but played just three league games 35 ) @entity185 ( @entity186 ) @entity186 can spend £ 8.8m nowadays and not even bat an eyelid - but when they parted with that sum to sign @entity185 from @entity189 in july 2007 , they were counting on recruiting a top striker			1
the @entity191 was given the no 10 shirt at the @entity193 and scored on his debut against @entity196 but things quickly went downhill from there			0
@entity185 lambasted @entity24 cuisine and was scathing in his views on the @entity205 alcohol culture - insisting he needed to return to @entity191 in order to progress as a player and earn international recognition			1
he scored four @entity9 goals in 19 games before heading on loan to @entity209 in january 2008 and then signing permanently for @entity210 that summer			2
he has enjoyed his pizza and pasta back home ever since			0
@entity185 signed for @entity186 for £ 8.8m from @entity189 in july 2007 but hated @entity24 cuisine and the alcohol culture @entity185 ( left ) is tackled by @entity217 's @entity216 during a @entity9 match in august 2007 34 ) @entity219 ( @entity64 ) the @entity221 striker was slow - a snail caught in a trail of treacle could move around the pitch quicker - and this greatly affected his success in @entity24			1
having signed for @entity64 on a free transfer from @entity77 in july 2007 , he originally impressed on his debut - with @entity230 even insisting that he was ' clever ' , had ' great game awareness ' and gave @entity64 ' many more options in attack '			0
that opinion was to be short - lived , however ... with just five league goals in his first season on @entity85 , @entity219 was loaned to @entity237 before returning to @entity238 for another year			1
he was sold to @entity239 for £ 4m in 2010 having netted just five goals in 27 @entity9 appearances			2
he has not been missed			0
@entity219 scored just five @entity9 goals in 27 appearances during his three years at @entity64 @entity219 winces after missing a chance for @entity64 against @entity245 in april 2008 ( left ) and against @entity246 in october 2007 33 ) @entity247 ( @entity248 ) having just won the @entity250 title with @entity251 , 20 - year - old @entity247 was lauded as a brilliant signing for @entity248 when they snapped him up for what seemed a very reasonable starting price of £ 6.25m in 2003			1
but the striker struggled to adapt to the @entity9 - never coping with the pace , power and intensity of matches - and @entity248 fans soon became disillusioned with his performances			1
his rating as one of the best strikers in @entity265 was quickly revised as he scored just once in 19 @entity9 games			2
incredibly , @entity247 was supposedly wanted by @entity267 while in charge at @entity269 but the deal failed to materialise			2
@entity272 fans beware - if @entity267 really does rate @entity247 , he could find himself at @entity274 in the not - too - distant future ... @entity247 ( right ) scored just once in the @entity9 for @entity248 after arriving for £ 6.25m the @entity250 striker ( centre ) is tackled by @entity64 's @entity278 ( right ) and @entity279 during a @entity9 match 32 ) @entity281 ( @entity248 and @entity116 ) @entity282 forward @entity281 had scored 16 in 35 for @entity217 , convincing @entity248 to pay £ 3m for him in august 2005 due to their desperate need for a striker			1
as soon as he arrived at @entity286 , however , it became clear he was not a @entity9 footballer			2
@entity288 had described his as a ' tall target man ; a hard - working , honest player with a good goal - scoring record			0
' so , what happened to it at @entity248 ? @entity281 struggled to control a ball , he was slow and just did not look at home on the pitch in @entity24 's top flight , leading @entity248 fans to view him as a laughing stock			0
he failed to score in any of his eight @entity9 appearances and was loaned to @entity302			2
the @entity302 then signed him permanently before he spent time at @entity116 , again failing to score in seven @entity9 games			0
he was just awful unfortunately			0
@entity281 played for @entity248 ( left ) and @entity116 during his time in the @entity9 unfortunately for @entity281 ( left ) , the majority of his time at @entity286 was spent warming the bench 31 ) @entity308 ( @entity309 ) @entity308 signed for £ 8.15m from @entity310 in 2002 after dazzling at the @entity311 and @entity309 had been forced to hold off strong competition from other clubs			1
the @entity191 started well on @entity314 but scored just 18 @entity9 goals in 81 games during five years at the @entity317			0
he was loaned to @entity319 and @entity320 before moving to the latter permanently in 2007 on a free transfer - having spent half a decade failing to light up the @entity24 game			0
although @entity309 fans remember him fondly for his workrate , endeavour and attitude , his obvious lack of footballing ability ensured they were tearing their hair out when it came to watching the @entity191 in front of goal			0
his record at most other clubs is fairly solid , but on @entity314 it was woeful			0
@entity308 ( right ) , competing for the ball with @entity338 's @entity337 , cost @entity309 £ 8.15m from @entity310 in 2002 @entity308 arrived at @entity309 with much prospect and to much fanfare ( left ) but left dejected having failed to fulfil his promise			0

@entity25 is counting down the top 50 worst - ever strikers to have played in the @entity9 era
@entity185 , @entity247 and @entity219 feature in second section of list of worst strikers
