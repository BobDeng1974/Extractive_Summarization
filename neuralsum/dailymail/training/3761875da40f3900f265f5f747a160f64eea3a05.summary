by @entity0 surgery may soon be a thing of the past for breast cancer patients , thanks to a new technique that destroys tumours by freezing them			2
a supercooled needle tip is repeatedly inserted into the cancerous tissue to turn it into a ball of ice , before it is then defrosted , leaving the tumour damaged			1
not requiring anaesthetic , the technique can be completed in about 15 minutes and could provide a better alternative to the current method of surgery , which requires women to stay in hospital for up to a week and can leave scars			1
putting the freeze on cancer : using a supercooled needle , cryoablation turns tumours into a ball of ice thirty breast cancer patients are currently trialling the system , which uses a needle cooled to @entity33 ( -274f ) by pumping liquid nitrogen through a network of tiny tubes			1
the surgeon can control the size of the ice ball produced to ensure it freezes the entire tumour in a procedure known as cryoablation			2
scientists from the @entity46 - based company @entity45 , which developed the device , say it could be used on cancerous masses up to the size of a golf ball			1
cancer hope : @entity45 chief executive @entity53 ' there have been attempts before to use heat to destroy cancer cells like this , but that can be extremely painful because our bodies are very sensitive to heat , ' chief executive @entity54 told @entity64			0
' @entity65 has an anaesthetising effect , so the patients feel very little pain during or after the procedure			0
' we have developed the system so it can be carried out in a normal doctors ' surgery as it is minimally invasive and relatively quick			0
' the device could help some of the 50,000 women annually diagnosed in the @entity75 with breast cancer			0
each year , around 39,000 lumpectomies are carried out , which involves the surgical removal of a lump from the breast			0
one in five women need further surgery after a lumpectomy , because not all the cancerous tissue is removed			2
the device has already been approved for use in the @entity87 and @entity45 is hopeful of getting @entity89 approval next year			0
scientists believe cryoablation could also be used to treat kidney , prostate and liver cancer			1
supercool : the needle is cooled to -170c with liquid nitrogen and inserted repeatedly into the tumour the technique could help the nearly 50,000 women diagnosed each year with breast cancer			1

needle cooled to -170c with liquid nitrogen repeatedly inserted into cancerous tissue
device turns cancerous tumour into ' ball of ice '
technique developed by @entity46 - based firm could be completed in 15 minutes without need for surgery
cryoablation could one *day* be used to treat kidney , prostate and liver cancer
