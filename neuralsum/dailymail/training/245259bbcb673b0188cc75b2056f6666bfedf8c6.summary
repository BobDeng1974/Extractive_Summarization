the decision to use prince @entity1 as the spearhead for @entity5 ’s 2018 @entity4 bid was under scrutiny last night after a controversial inquiry ruled that the @entity8 used corrupt tactics			1
the @entity5 bid was condemned as ‘ improper ’ yesterday by a @entity12 ethics probe , which cleared @entity13 and @entity14 of any wrongdoing			1
the @entity1 was left ‘ bitterly disappointed ’ in 2010 when he – along with @entity18 and @entity19 – were ‘ stitched up ’ in the secret ballot , winning only two of a possible 22 votes , despite having privately secured the pledges of at least five @entity12 delegates			1
bid team : @entity18 and prince @entity1 were part of the @entity8 delegation in @entity26 in 2010 the trio felt ‘ lied to ’ , according to one @entity5 bid member who said it was ‘ embarrassing that @entity1 and the prime minister have lent their good names ’ to the project			1
@entity1 was reported to have objected to having to fawn to @entity12 officials who had assembled in @entity26 to decide which countries should host the @entity4 finals of 2018 and 2022			1
he was quoted as having said : ‘ i do n’t see why we have to suck up to these people			0
’ the @entity39 later shed light on the extent to which @entity1 pushed to secure the votes of delegates from @entity12 , football ’s governing body			2
mr @entity19 told how he had met the prince coming out of one meeting : ‘ he said it had gone really , really well			0
i said , “ gosh , how did you do it ? what did you offer him , an invitation to the royal wedding ? ” he said , “ prime minister , i went so far i think i offered to marry him			0
” ’ @entity1 was keeping a dignified silence yesterday			0
but @entity8 chairman @entity56 described the @entity12 claims as ‘ a joke ’			2
the report by @entity12 ethics judge @entity60 was scathing about @entity5 ’s conduct , including severely reprimanding it for a £ 35,000 sponsorship of a gala dinner for the then @entity12 vice-president @entity65 in his native @entity66 it said that the now disgraced @entity65 had abused his power to exact personal benefits and @entity5 ‘ showed willingness , time and again , to meet such expectation , thereby damaging the image of @entity12 and the bidding process ’			2
prince @entity1 , @entity18 and the prime minister share a joke at a meeting before the announcement that @entity13 would host the @entity4 in 2018 , not @entity5 @entity13 , which won the 2018 bid , and @entity14 , selected as 2022 hosts , were handed a clean bill of health despite suspicions they may have bribed their way to success			1
yet just hours after publishing its findings yesterday , @entity12 – long dogged by claims of corruption – was rocked when @entity60 ’s report was disowned by the chief investigator , @entity90 lawyer @entity89			0
@entity60 ’s 42 - page report was a summary of a 430 - page report – not published – by @entity89 who spent nearly two years investigating the corruption claims on behalf of @entity12			0
@entity89 said the summary contained ‘ numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations ’			0
an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the @entity5 bid			2
