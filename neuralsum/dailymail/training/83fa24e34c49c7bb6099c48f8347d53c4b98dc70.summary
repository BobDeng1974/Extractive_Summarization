by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:54 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:57 est , 23 december 2013 neanderthals had the ability to speak like modern humans , according to a new study			0
in the last 20 years , some scientists have come to believe that @entity3 had the ability to communicate with each other using speech , and new analysis of a fossilised hyoid bone has added weight to their claims			1
the horseshoe - shaped bone in the neck looks like a modern human ’s and now computer modelling has revealed that it was probably used in a similar way			2
the hyoid bone of a @entity3 - a horseshoe - shaped bone in the neck - looks like a modern human 's and now computer modelling shows that it was used in a similar way			1
a male @entity26 and pan troglodytes hyoid bone used in the study are pictured the hyoid bone supports the root of the tongue and enables humans to speak			2
researchers believe the way the bone worked is ‘ highly suggestive ’ of complex speech in @entity3			1
writing in journal @entity38 , a team of scientists said : ‘ @entity3 and modern human hyoids also present very similar internal architectures and micro-biomechanical behaviours ’			1
the researchers used @entity45 imaging and mechanical modelling to analyse the throat bone and work out how it behaved in relation to the surrounding bones in @entity3			2
‘ we would argue that this is a very significant step forward			0
it shows that the @entity54 hyoid does n't just look like those of modern humans - it was used in a very similar way , said @entity58 , from the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			1
‘ many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human			0
if @entity3 also had language then they were truly human , too , ’ he told @entity63			2
before the discovery of a @entity3 hyoid bone in 1989 , it was thought that only modern humans were capable of complex speech , which evolved around 100,000 years ago			1
many would argue that our capacity for speech and language is among the most fundamental of characteristics that make us human			0
if @entity3 ( illustrated ) also had language then they were truly human , too , ' professor @entity58 said the hyoid bone is also known as the lingual bone			1
it is a horseshoe - shaped bone situated in the front of the neck between the chin and the thyroid cartilage			0
unlike other bones , the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments			0
it aids in tongue movement and swallowing and provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above , the voice box below , and the epiglottis ( the flap that sits at the base of the tongue , which keeps food from going into the windpipe ) and pharynx ( which keeps food and liquids out of the lungs ) behind			0
the discovery of a modern - looking hyoid bone of a neanderthal man in the @entity112 in @entity113 led its discoverers to argue that the @entity3 had a descended larynx , and thus human - like speech capabilities			1
the hyoid bone was discovered in @entity112 in @entity113 and is similar to the same bone found in modern humans			1
professor @entity58 said bones up to 500,000 years old , which were found in @entity122 and are thought to belong to @entity123 - a relative of modern humans - could show that the origins of speech are even older than thought			1
while he admitted that the research , which used computer modelling to investigate whether @entity3 could speak , should not be accepted a proof , he said : ‘ i do think it will help to convince a good number of specialists and tip the weight of opinion			0
’ a study by the @entity137 published earlier this year suggested that the last common ancestor we shared with the @entity3 around half a million years ago , shared speech and language with modern humans			2
@entity143 researchers believe that the origins of our modern language are ten times older than previously thought and are interested in the implications for understanding present day linguistic diversity			2
psycholinguistics researchers @entity148 and @entity150 , said that far from being slow brutes , @entity3 ’ cognitive capacities and culture were comparable to ours			0
the duo , who have looked at past findings in detail , argue that essentially modern language and speech are an ancient feature of our lineage dating back at least to the most recent ancestor we shared with the @entity3 and the @entity164 ( another form of humanity known mostly from their genome )			0
professor @entity148 said he thinks the news study supports the idea that speech and language is an ancient feature reaching back at least to the last common ancestor we shared with @entity3 .			0

researchers including the @entity59 , @entity62 , found that the hyoid bone in @entity3 worked like a modern human 's
the scientists believe the way the bone worked is ‘ highly suggestive ’ of complex speech in @entity3
further studies may show the origins of speech are earlier than thought
