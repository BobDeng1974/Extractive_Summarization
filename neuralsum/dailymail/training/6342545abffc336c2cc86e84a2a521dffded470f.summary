by @entity1 reporter published : 17:22 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 04:22 est , 21 february 2013 prince @entity3 picturesque rural idyll is under siege after planning was approved for three sprawling housing estates on his doorstep			1
planning permission has been granted for more than 500 new homes in @entity11 , @entity12 , with one development due to be built just one mile from his @entity15 home			1
angry locals who have fought the controversial plans have now written to the environmentalist royal in a last ditch attempt to stop developers from moving in			1
residents in @entity11 , @entity12 , have written to prince @entity3 in a bid to stop three housing estates being built - one of which is just a mile from @entity15 , pictured campaign group @entity28 's @entity27 said prince @entity3 is very involved in the town and they feel that the royal is their ' neighbour ' developers had fought and lost a bid for planning permission for homes on a plot of land just one mile from his estate for the last 25 years			1
local councillors repeatedly rejected plans for the site and another greenfield in @entity11 but this decision has now been overturned by communities secretary @entity43			1
horrified locals who have been fighting the greenfield plans - on an @entity46 - have called the decision ' a devastating blow '			1
a third plot , on an old brownfield site , had already been approved by councillors and is supported by locals			2
this means builders will start erecting 436 homes and 50 care apartments within weeks - boosting the size of @entity11 , which currently has 2,500 homes , by 20 per cent			1
a spokeswoman from @entity28 's @entity27 ( @entity59 ) said : ' we feel that prince @entity3 is our neighbour			1
he is very involved in the town and has a shop here			2
' he is going to be able to see these houses on the site			0
part of the site crowns a little and rises in the centre so you will be able to see it for miles			0
' we are a small market town of 2,500 houses , to give us 463 houses and apartments and a care home is a huge thing to do			0
mayor of @entity11 @entity78 said he is ' bitterly disappointed ' at @entity43 's decision to grant planning permission for the housing estates on the doorstep of prince @entity3 's @entity15 home ' our infrastructure is extremely stretched already			1
we are not @entity85 , we feel there is already a large development on the brownfield site			0
' it is out of scale with the size of the town			0
if someone does n't do something they will build here			0
' the brownfield site , on a former factory to the north of the town , will see 174 homes along with a 60 - bed care home and 50 care apartments built			0
a further 250 homes will be built at @entity104 , an open greenfield site , with 39 erected on a second field on @entity107 - less than a mile from @entity15			1
in a letter to @entity3 , sent after @entity59 was informed of mr @entity43 ' decision on february 14 , the residents said ' no one is listening to us '			2
they wrote : ' during the inquiry into the @entity104 application no notice was taken of our representation , in the form of a residents signed letter , that these particular fields have been used by locals for over 20 years for recreation and dog walking			2
' locals say the new housing estates will be visible from prince @entity3 's 900 acres @entity15 @entity126 first applied to build on the @entity107 site in 1988 and repeated the request numerous times before submitting an application for 39 homes last march			1
this was refused by @entity133 but communities secretary @entity43 overturned the decision this month			0
radical changes to the planning system mean developers can apply for permission to build on greenfield sites			1
this applies when the local council can not prove it has land supply for the next five years			2
campaigners fear mr @entity43 overturning @entity133 's rejection of plans on the greenfield sites will set a ' dangerous precedent ' for other areas			2
the @entity59 spokeswoman added : ' if councils are n't said to have enough land supply then anybody can apply to build on greenfield land			1
' this is regardless of whether there are brownfield sites available			0
hundreds of new homes will be built at @entity104 in @entity11 - set two and a half miles from @entity15 ' the council can reject the developers application but then it can be appealed and accepted by central government			1
it has left everything open			0
' @entity11 mayor @entity78 said : ' i am bitterly disappointed by this decision			2
' i feel that in this case an inappropriate application of the appeal process and the provisions of the @entity169 has led to our community having inappropriate and unwanted development forced upon us			0
' it is too early to say what is going to happen in the immediate future but i intend to push for close engagement with the district council and developers in order to minimise the community impact and maximise the community benefit			0
' campaigners have six weeks to appeal mr @entity43 ' decision at the @entity185			0
a meeting will take place between @entity188 and @entity133 later this week to decide whether an appeal will be lodged			0
a spokeswoman for @entity191 declined to comment on the situation .			0

three developments have been granted planning permission in @entity11
one is on greenfield land just one mile from @entity15
locals said prince @entity3 is their ' neighbour ' and have written to the royal in a last ditch attempt to stop the developments from going ahead
