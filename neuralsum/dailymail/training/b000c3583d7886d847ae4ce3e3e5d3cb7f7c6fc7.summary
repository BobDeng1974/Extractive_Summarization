by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 1 march 2014 updated : 22:27 est , 1 march 2014 not so scared : crows will have to be shooed away thoroughly by farmers before they can be shot @entity5 ’s farmers must try to shoo away birds before they can be shot for damaging crops , according to new plans from the government ’s wildlife advisers			1
and anyone breaking the rules could face prosecution , with a maximum six months in jail or a £ 5,000 fine			1
the new proposals have caused uproar , with farming and countryside groups labelling them ‘ ludicrous ’			0
at present , if farmers have a problem with pigeons or crows eating wheat or stealing chickens ’ eggs , they can decide the best option is to shoot them			1
they only need to be ‘ satisfied ’ that scaring or other measures such as netting would be ineffective or impracticable before reaching for the gun			1
but officials from the government ’s wildlife advisers @entity32 now want to ensure that other methods are tried before farmers shoot			0
under their proposals , it would be a legal requirement for licensed gun owners to take ‘ reasonable and appropriate steps ’ such as ‘ scaring ’ to resolve any problem before resorting to firearms			1
the new rules are included in a shake - up of the @entity45 , which allows licensed gun owners to kill pests such as magpies , crows and rooks			2
@entity50 , of the @entity51 , said : ‘ what are we supposed to do – go out in bright shiny clothes , waving our arms and making a lot of noise before shooting ? and who is going to wander round fields checking whether every pigeon - shooter has tried to scare away the pest birds before shooting ? ’ the @entity63 ’s @entity62 said : ‘ this is ridiculous and shows @entity32 has no understanding of pigeon control or the damage pigeons can do			2
’ @entity68 , of the @entity69 , added : ‘ you do n’t go out waving the white flag before you shoot			0
we will support proposals that make sense but will oppose impractical suggestions tooth and nail			0
’ @entity77 : farmers say crows , pigeons and other birds pose a huge risk of damage to their crops but a @entity86 spokesman said : ‘ the licence gives landowners the right to remove individual birds that are causing a problem , but we ’ve always questioned the validity of those who appear to just go out and shoot birds for the pot , which is not allowed			1
’ the changes are contained in a consultation process initiated by @entity32 last week			0
in a statement , @entity32 said : ‘ the requirement is that people take reasonable steps to resolve problems by means that are lawful and do n’t require a licence			1
‘ for example , many farmers will use gas - guns or scarecrows to deter birds			0
however , this is often not wholly effective and lethal control will also be necessary			0
this is appropriate as the farmers are clearly doing everything reasonable and practicable			2
’ but the ne plans have met with derision on social network sites , with one @entity116 user asking : ‘ are they paid a bonus for stupid ideas or is this par for the course ? ’			0

those breaking the rules could face six months in jail or a £ 5,000 fine
currently farmers only have to be ' satisfied ' scaring crows would *n't* work
but soon they will have to take ' reasonable an appropriate steps ' to prove it
plans *slammed* by the @entity63 but supported by the @entity86
