from the erratic football act once dubbed ‘ @entity2 ’ by former boss @entity1 , here was ‘ the @entity3 ’			1
@entity5 was sent off for a crazed lunge at two - goal @entity8 international @entity7 with 14 minutes to go as the defender ’s temper flared up in friendly action			1
@entity7 appeared to barge late into @entity5 and , as both players were lifting themselves off the turf , the @entity13 man sought revenge by launching himself head - first to slam into the @entity20 striker ’s side			1
marching orders : @entity5 was sent off for an alleged headbutt on @entity20 's @entity7 easy pickings : @entity7 netted twice for the @entity24 as they beat @entity13 2 - 0 on saturday afternoon @entity20 : ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity25 ; @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ; @entity30 ; @entity31 ( @entity32 70 ) , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity7 ( @entity36 75 )			1
subs not used : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity36 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity13 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity5 , @entity49 ( @entity50 68 ) ; @entity51 ( @entity52 60 ) , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 60 ) ; @entity58 ( @entity59 75 )			2
subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 sent off : @entity5			2
referee : @entity66 the jolting collision will doubtless earn @entity5 a suspension to start the competitive season to go with a rebuke from @entity71 that his actions were ‘ unacceptable ’			1
the @entity13 manager is not finished with him yet , either			2
@entity71 turned his back and had no interest engaging with the @entity77 international as he ambled towards the tunnel			1
words were kept brief and to the point in the dressing room afterwards			2
@entity5 can expect more talks over an incident that further taints a disciplinary record that @entity71 will be wary of carrying into @entity86 battle if there remains the danger of a key player letting himself and colleagues down with a top flight return at stake			1
' there are no excuses for it , ' said @entity71 , whose team face @entity98 in the @entity99 on tuesday then @entity96 in the league kick - off on sunday			1
' it ’s a big disappointment to see that happening			2
he ’s going to have to learn			2
the team need him and we all need each other			2
' he ’s not a daft boy			2
when his head is in the right place and he ’s focused , he ’s an integral part of our team			2
but he ’s let himself down			0
' you can only point him in the right direction			0
he knows it ’s wrong and unacceptable			0
' at this moment we do n’t know if he can play on tuesday or sunday			1
straight away it ’s given us a headache we could ’ve done without			0
' we spoke briefly but i do n’t think that ’s the best time to look at a situation			0
sometimes you let the dust settle and assess the whole thing and have a chat with him			0
' we will watch it again and talk about it further			0
' a charming individual off the park , @entity5 is a combustible competitor drawn to wild mood swings on the pitch			0
while @entity132 wheels out the same old biting act , @entity5 does n’t have a signature move of indiscipline			0
plenty to ponder : @entity137 boss @entity71 saw his team comfortably swept aside at the @entity139 @entity140 : a flare was thrown on to the pitch by one of @entity13 ' 8,000 travelling supporters he has a far more creative streak , finding all manner of ways to be sent off			1
the charge sheet before this moment of madness included three reds and 17 yellows in only 52 appearances for @entity155			0
at previous clubs he ’s argued with his own team - mates after a dismissal			0
last season he saw red for clashing post-match with @entity161 boss @entity160			1
there are dangerous fouls and fits of temper			0
could saturday 's all - new manoeuvre be the 27 - year - old ’s last in a @entity13 jersey ? there was interest from @entity171 team @entity170 during the close season			1
with @entity47 at right back yesterday and @entity59 starting on the bench , @entity71 does have centre half options			1
@entity5 bailed out @entity47 after an early slip let in @entity35 but that last ditch tackle to prevent an early strike and a goal - line clearance late in the first half were highlights in front of 9000 travelling supporters			1
he was n’t the only @entity13 player guilty of dodgy distribution issues that plagued efforts to work the ball to classier acts up the pitch in @entity55 and @entity58 who , on limited evidence , are on the same wavelength			0
@entity192 should ’ve fared better with a back post header carved out by one such law and @entity58 combination			0
good day 's business : @entity20 manager @entity197 watched from the stands a lone striker for @entity20 in a struggling @entity202 season of 2007/08 , @entity58 ’s return to the @entity139 saw him deployed in that role for an hour before the introduction of @entity57 to make a pair			1
by then @entity20 ’s up tempo opening to the second half had paved the way for victory			0
@entity31 caused problems and the @entity212 fan and @entity214 attacker was berated by @entity13 fans right up until he gave the away end the sarcastic thumbs up at his substitution			1
but it was @entity20 ’s schemer on the opposite flank , @entity35 , who was the main danger and he smacked the base of @entity46 ’s left hand post			0
on 58 minutes , his speedy burst into the area was too much for @entity48 and , as he drew @entity46 out of goal and into a collision with – you ’ve guessed it - @entity5 , @entity35 picked out @entity7 lurking eight yards out			0
last season ’s top scorer bundled home			1
for the second on 74 , @entity7 ’s movement evaded @entity47 and he latched on to a @entity30 pass to cleverly tuck home past @entity46			0
@entity7 craved a hat - trick but then clashed with @entity5 , was booked for his part in the flashpoint and swiftly replaced by @entity36 .			0

@entity71 's side kick off their season against @entity96 next sunday
@entity197 host @entity243 on saturday in the league
@entity137 took 8,000 travelling fans to the @entity139
