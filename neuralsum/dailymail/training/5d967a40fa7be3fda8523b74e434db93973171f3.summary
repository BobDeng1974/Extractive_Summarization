by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:26 est , 30 september 2012 updated : 12:49 est , 30 september 2012 @entity13 ’s new policy guru today spent more than 45 minutes railing against queue - jumping , the demise of the milkman and people who have adverts tattooed on their foreheads as he warned the @entity8 there are some ‘ public goods ’ money can not buy			1
in a speech - cum - seminar hailed as ‘ brilliant ’ by the @entity8 leader , @entity17 professor @entity16 asked delegates if they had ever tried to hire a friend , buy a best man ’s speech for a wedding or pay a child to write thank you notes			1
blairite commentator @entity28 tweeted : ‘ an afternoon with @entity16 is the most self - indulgent thing i 've ever seen at a major party conference			1
’ ' @entity31 - indulgent ' : @entity17 professor @entity16 told the @entity8 conference there was more to life than what money could buy during the main event on the opening day of the @entity8 conference in @entity41 , the @entity37 political philosopher also questioned the morality of paying someone for sex , to donate a kidney or to persuade them to go on a diet			1
mr @entity16 also appeared to suggest it was wrong for wealthy parents to send their children to private schools			1
but after attacking the worst excesses of capitalism , it was announced mr @entity16 was available to sell signed copies of his new book , @entity57 : the @entity58			1
mr @entity13 seemed hugely impressed , slapping mr @entity16 on the back at the end of his performance , and telling him : ‘ we have never had anything like that before			1
’ money ca n't buy friends : labour leader @entity13 hailed mr @entity16 's speech as ' brilliant ' in a rambling lecture , mr @entity16 prowled the stage and challenged @entity8 delegates in the sparsely - attended conference hall to wrestle with big moral questions			1
‘ in more and more domains of life it is possible to pay extra and jump the queue , ’ he complained			2
‘ increasingly it is possible now to hire someone to stand in a queue for you			0
this is a familiar practice for rock concerts , theatre , sporting events			0
’ he also pointed to the phenomenon of people who had the names of companies tattooed on their forehead as walking billboards , only for the firms to go bust			0
‘ a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale , ’ he said			0
mr @entity16 complained that there was now nothing which was not for sale , including people 's foreheads which were bought up as advertising space by internet firms in @entity105 and @entity106 there were more paid military contractors on the ground than there were @entity37 military troops			1
‘ this does n’t happen because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies			0
’ but he insisted : ‘ there are still today some things that money can not buy			1
one such thing is friendship			2
‘ if you do n’t have as many friends as you would like it might occur to you to try to buy some			2
‘ but you would quickly realise it might not work			0
why not ? somehow the money that would buy the friend would dissolve the good you are feeling			2
‘ a hired friend is not the same as a real one			0
’ he then turned to wedding speeches , and websites which help people to write a toast by supplying information about the happy couple			0
mr @entity16 denounced the idea : ‘ the financial transaction to some degree erodes the expression			1
’ in a debate on the impact of supermarkets squeezing out small shops and farmers , one delegate said she paid for a milkman even though it cost more despite the economic pressures on most hard - pressed families , he even appeared to encourage them to spend more on their weekly shopping to sustain their local grocer			0
‘ some worry that supermarkets dominate high streets in towns across @entity159 , what will become of the small local shops , the local grocer ? ‘ will they be crowded out ? will big box stores decimate the high street trade ? what about suppliers , farmers who are squeezed in the prices they get for their milk by big supermarket chains ? ’ mr @entity16 said it was important that people from different walks of life ' bump up against each other ' one delegate was applauded after saying she got her milk delivered by a milkman , even though it was more expensive			1
after a brief discussion on the merits of banning advertising for children , which took in promotional campaigns for climbing trees and sugary breakfast cereal , mr @entity16 then questioned whether it was acceptable to use public money to persuade people to stop smoking , lose weight or taking their medication			1
‘ when should you use questionable motives to get people to do good things ? ’ he went on : ‘ if someone is willing to pay for sex or to buy a kidney and a consenting adult is willing to sell , the only question standard economics is willing to ask is : how much ? ‘ it has drained our public discourse of moral and civil energy and contributed to the technocratic politics			2
' he said wealthy people and those on modest means coming to lead increasingly separate lives			0
‘ we live and work and shop and play in different places , our children go to different schools			0
‘ this is not good for democracy , nor is it a satisfactory way to live even for those of us who may end up on the top			0
‘ democracy does n't require perfect equality but it does require that citizens share a common life			0
‘ it is important that people from different walks of life bump up against each other			0
‘ do you want a society where everything is up for sale or are there certain moral and civil goods that markets do n’t offer and money can not buy ? ’			2
