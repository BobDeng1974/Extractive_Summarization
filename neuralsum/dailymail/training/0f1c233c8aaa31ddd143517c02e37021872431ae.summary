@entity0 was caught last night in a 6,175 mile @entity1 as @entity2 looked ready to formally offer him political asylum this week			2
the @entity6 whistleblower may receive a temporary travel document to fly to @entity8 but then face the logistical nightmare of having no route into exile that is beyond the reach @entity13 's long arm of justice			0
@entity15 is keen for @entity2 to offer him asylum , and bid farewell to a man who has been holed up in the transit zone of a @entity22 airport for two weeks			1
he may have to fly 14,000 miles clear across the @entity27 to avoid @entity13 and @entity28 - 3.jpg still stuck : @entity0 made one of the biggest @entity31 intelligence leaks in history			1
his pleas for asylum have finally been accepted in @entity2 , but leaving @entity22 is proving problematic ' he needs to choose a place to go , ' insisted deputy foreign minister @entity36			2
but sources say @entity0 will not be allowed to board the only @entity39 plane that offers direct connections to @entity8 , a regular service to @entity43 capital @entity44			1
the routing overflies both the @entity28 and the @entity31 and there are fears the plane will be denied rights to @entity51 airspace , and forced to land , leading to @entity0 's arrest			1
the direct distance from @entity22 to @entity8 is 6,175 miles but last night it appeared too far for @entity0			2
indeed , unless @entity15 secret services actively connive with his escape by a clandestine route , it is looking hard to see how he can flee @entity15			0
' @entity2 is waiting for an answer from @entity0			0
this , perhaps , is his last chance to receive political asylum , ' said @entity15 mp @entity65 , seen as close to the @entity67			0
otherwise his only option would be to remain in @entity15 and accept glamorous spy @entity70 's offer to marry him , he joked			0
@entity2 president @entity72 has vowed to grant asylum to @entity0 , to protect him ' from the global persecution of the empire ' , meaning the @entity31			2
sticky situation : @entity2 president @entity72 has vowed to grant @entity0 asylum , but getting to @entity8 involves a logistical and political nightmare that the @entity80 administration is trying to make even more difficult with @entity15 getting publicly impatient with the @entity31 whistleblower 's presence in its transit zone , his escape route is a logistical nightmare			1
' instead of going west to @entity2 , his obvious option is east to @entity87 and then across the @entity27 to @entity8 , ' said one source			0
it would mean @entity15 allowing him to formally enter its territory , which so far it has refused to do , unwilling to upset the @entity31			0
denied : an @entity39 @entity93 plane heading to the @entity43 capital @entity44 takes off from @entity22 's @entity96 airport july 6 , 2013			1
sources say @entity0 wo n't be allowed onto the only direct flight to @entity8 , via @entity44 , @entity43 roundabout : @entity15 's @entity96 outside @entity22 where @entity0 remains in flux			1
with a western flight blocked , he may have to fly 14,000 miles across the @entity27 to reach @entity8 this would also involve a 14,200 mile detour and a routing that would bring him close to the @entity31 state of @entity106 posing a risk to any private plane willing to take him on a route where there are no scheduled services			0
' the only solution is to smuggle him on board a military or diplomatic plane , but even then the @entity31 last week managed to ground the president of @entity117 's plane when they thought @entity0 was on board , ' said another source			0
president @entity121 was subject to an humiliating delay at @entity123 after his jet was refused permission to overfly the airspace of @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
the @entity117 leader has since offered @entity0 asylum as has @entity133			2
that 's about enough : @entity15 mp @entity65 has expressed the country 's growing annoyance , and unwillingness to tolerate , @entity0 's presence halted : @entity117 's @entity121 said he would grant asylum to @entity0			1
@entity139 and other @entity13 leaders expressed outrage over the recent grounding of the president 's plane , which the @entity31 believed carried @entity0 fighting the power : @entity133 's president @entity146 confirmed his country received an asylum request from @entity0 and said he would grant it if ' the circumstances allowed it '			1

@entity2 offers asylum but @entity0 's path to the @entity13 country may have force him across the @entity27 to avoid @entity13 and @entity28 airspace
the 30 - year - old wo n't be allowed aboard the most direct flight from @entity22 via @entity44 , @entity43
@entity117 and @entity133 have also offered asylum
@entity15 is *increasingly* vocal about its annoyance at @entity0 's weeks - long presence at a @entity22 airport
