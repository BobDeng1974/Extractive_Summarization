@entity0 obviously was n’t listening to the half time team talk from @entity2 at the @entity3 on wednesday night			1
the @entity5 coach , furious that the referee had sent off his captain @entity7 in the tunnel , had told his players that the game had finished and instructed them not to push themselves in the second 45 minutes , concentrating instead on conserving energy , playing out time and not conceding			1
it was just three minutes into the second half that the @entity16 international threw his boot at the linesman escaping punishment presumably because on a night when chaos had reigned since the 47th second when @entity21 opened the scoring the referee just did n’t register the seriousness of the offence			1
video - scroll down to see a vine mocking @entity0 throwing his boot @entity25 's @entity0 hurls his boot at a linesman but remarkably only received a yellow card the @entity29 and @entity25 clash was full of incident , including @entity31 hurling his boot at the linesman @entity2 was proud of his players efforts and said he told them to show restraint in the second half retired referee @entity35 said on thursday in his column in @entity37 : ‘ @entity0 should have been sent off not shown the yellow card ’			1
in his defence the player had had his boot knocked off before he launched it at linesman @entity41			2
he had n’t taken it off on purpose , it was n’t quite the significant religious act of disrespect that it was likened to post-match with the @entity49 virals doing the rounds of @entity51 pelting his branded footwear at @entity54			0
the fiery @entity25 midfielder is no stranger to controversy			2
in the last @entity58 voting he did n’t vote for his coach @entity2 as manager of the year , although he later claimed this was an error by @entity63			2
more than firebrand however his reputation is for flamboyance			0
last year he appeared on @entity16 ’s version of ‘ @entity68 ’			0
in the @entity70 edition of the talent show showing up as a guest contestant singing : @entity73 – a classic @entity75 rock song			0
the 29 - year - old midfield lapped up the applause and took the criticism of his dubious sining talents well			0
@entity0 ( centre ) surrounded by @entity82 ( left ) , @entity83 ( second right ) and @entity84 ( right ) @entity85 silences the @entity3 after firing @entity29 3 - 2 up against @entity25 in the @entity86 the panel of judges on @entity91 @entity90 ’s disciplinary panel are likely to show far more mercy to the midfielder			1
there is far less retrospective punishment handed out in @entity91 than in @entity96 – the referee ’s report tends to be final			0
in his report of wednesday ’s night ’s game match referee @entity99 said that @entity0 had thrown his boot off the pitch in frustration and made no reference to the fact that it narrowly missed the linesman and also endangered the safety of a @entity3 ball - boy			1
just as @entity110 was only given a two - game ban for his red card , picked up last week against @entity113 for @entity114 because the referee ’s report did not mention him striking @entity116 , so @entity0 will not have his yellow card bumped up to a red			1
neither will @entity0 be disciplined by his own manager			2
the defeat to @entity29 on wednesday was one long nightmare for @entity2 who had two players sent off and one locked up pre-match when he argued with police and slammed one officer ’s hand in his car			1
the coach wants to move on			0
@entity2 will be relieved that @entity0 will not receive a ban and his yellow card will not be upgraded @entity21 opened the scoring at the @entity3 after just 40 seconds on wednesday night @entity0 shaved his head two years ago after winning the @entity86 final against @entity114 at the @entity135			1
he did in the dressing room immediately after the game and came out in to the mixed zone to show off his new lock to the waiting press			0
‘ i promised i would do it so i did , ’ he said			0
maybe his team - mates will ask him to promise not to throw anymore boots , what they wont ask him to do is ever change his slightly peculiar ways .			0

@entity25 's @entity0 threw his boot at a linesman on *tuesday* night
