@entity0 will win his 100th @entity2 cap on saturday when he leads the side out against @entity4 at @entity5			1
here , we look back at @entity8 's match report from the night he made his bow for his country			0
@entity0 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity14 's @entity13 during the defeat @entity16 gave @entity0 his first cap for @entity2 as a 17 - year - old @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity19 ( @entity20 45min ) ; @entity21 ( @entity22 45 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 45 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 45 ) , a @entity27 ( @entity28 45 ) ; @entity29 ( @entity30 45 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 45 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 45 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 45 ) ; @entity37 ( @entity38 45 ) , @entity39 ( @entity0 45 )			1

@entity14 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity13 , @entity48 ( @entity49 72 ) , @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 87 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 45 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 76 ) ; @entity58 ( @entity59 85 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 56 )			1

full marks for the @entity14 , plus marks for the @entity71 and a large black mark for @entity16 and the players who purport to be the current @entity2 side			1
if the appearance of @entity0 and his young chums offered a glimmer hope for the future , the slow , agonising surrender of those who went before them caused only anxiety at @entity83 last night			2
so disappointing were @entity16 's troubled side in the first half of this ludicrous friendly that his confirmation that all 11 members of the ' a ' team would be replaced by @entity90 resembled something akin to a tactical masterstroke			1
@entity2 's first xi were awful , losing to a far more industrious and infinitely more inventive @entity14 in a fashion alarmingly reminiscent of that shambles against @entity96 in @entity97 last october			1
for @entity16 it was a catastrophe , and not just because a first defeat to our friends from @entity102 now sits on his c.v			1
appeasing the clubs by limiting his players to no more than 45 minutes was always going to be a risky business			0
last night , it was made to look utterly foolish			0
this was @entity2 's one and only chance to prepare for next month 's @entity114 doubleheader against @entity115 and @entity116			2
in the end , they did not even have the opportunity to restore some much - needed confidence after the break			0
@entity16 made a total of 11 changes at half - time , including the then - @entity126 star @entity0 @entity60 rounds goalkeeper @entity19 to score @entity14 's second of the night @entity16 might have apologised on the eve of this encounter for the fact that @entity2 caps are cheap these days but there can be no excuse for giving away defeats in as reckless a manner as this			1
@entity14 , who had not played together for 15 months , took little more than 15 minutes to inflict the first blow , @entity48 opening the scoring with a far - post header , before @entity60 added to @entity2 's humiliation three minutes before the halftime whistle			1
what a pity the @entity144 forward enjoys so little exposure in the international arena			0
how @entity0 must have felt was anybody 's guess			2
not only was he denied the chance to join the big boys for what should have been a joyous occasion for @entity2 's youngest international , but he and his inexperienced colleagues were being asked to rescue a most embarrassing situation for the seniors			1
they did better than many perhaps imagined , taking the lead in the latter of what were two games of one half with a fine goal from @entity38 before losing the chance to gloat when @entity51 added @entity14 's third in the 83rd minute			1
even so , they still did a good deal better than @entity29 and co. @entity38 is congratulated by @entity0 and @entity169 having halved the deficit at 201 @entity0 showed that , even at 17 and 111 days , he is certainly man enough for the job			1
his talent is raw , his ability still a touch unrefined , but he made an immediate impression that gave the ' b ' team real impetus			0
controlling the ball on his chest quite beautifully , he then exchanged passes with the impressive @entity34 and unleashed a long - range pass that fell at the feet of @entity36			0
at that stage it was @entity2 's best move of the match and almost ended in a goal but for @entity36 's failure to hit the target			2
@entity38 , another product of the @entity126 youth team until moving to @entity190 , took his goal wondercumbing - fully , meeting a 70th - minute cross from @entity34 with a perfect header			1
another bright spot was @entity30 demonstrating the same @entity198 form that should see him restored to the first team for next month 's matches			0
the kids did well , particularly when one considers they were faced with an @entity14 team that made just one change at halftime and were already two up			2
@entity207 's goal when the @entity209 striker ran on to a @entity61 pass before diverting the ball through the legs of @entity20 was no disgrace			0
@entity29 lies dejected on the floor during the defeat at @entity83 in february 2003 had an understandably disillusioned crowd known just how depressing the first half would be , they would have urged the @entity218 to kick off as planned at eight o'clock			2
as it was , travel chaos and a halfempty stadium persuaded the organisers to put the start back by 15 minutes , which succeeded only in delaying the embarrassment			0
before the start , @entity19 must have relished the chance to appear at @entity83 without the burden of standing behind the worst defence in the @entity229			0
by the time @entity14 had scored , though , he must have felt he was back playing for @entity230			1
those with the most to prove all tried to make an early impression			0
@entity35 looked busy down the left , @entity31 passed smoothly from the centre and a cross that was intended for @entity39 turned into an attempt on goal for @entity37			2
@entity0 came on as a second - half substitute for striker @entity39 @entity239 hails ' special ' skipper @entity0 that , however , was about as good as it got for @entity2 's ' a ' team and it was not long before @entity244 's spirited side had taken control			1
@entity48 has already made @entity39 's life a misery twice this season as a centre half for @entity250 and he added @entity2 to his illustrious list of scalps when he escaped the attentions of @entity21 to head the ball home at the far post			1
a terrific save from @entity19 then denied @entity58 a second for @entity14 but there was little he could do when @entity23 allowed @entity60 to muscle him off the ball , drag the ball wide of the @entity2 goalkeeper and shoot into an empty net			1
with the second half came an improvement from @entity2 's lions cubs , a performance of some promise for which they did not deserve the boos they received at the final whistle			2
after the @entity272 and the @entity273 , such displeasure should have been reserved for those responsible			0
then - @entity144 midfielder @entity60 wheels away in celebration at his first - half strike			0

@entity0 , who was then an @entity126 player , made his debut for @entity2 in an *infamous* defeat by @entity14 .
aged 17 years and 111 days , he was the youngest player to become a full @entity2 international
manager @entity16 made 11 changes at half - time , bringing on @entity0 to replace @entity39
@entity38 scored @entity2 *â€™s* goal in a 3 - 1 defeat
