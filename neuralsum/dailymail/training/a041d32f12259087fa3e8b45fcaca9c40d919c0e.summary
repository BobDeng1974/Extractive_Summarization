by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 23 january 2013 big money : chief executive @entity2 could pocket an annual bonus of £ 700,000 , on top of his £ 560,000 salary , £ 160,660 pension payments and £ 15,000 additional benefits bosses at @entity9 could be in line for bonuses worth 125 per cent of their salary , according to a leaked memo			1
it means @entity9 chief executive @entity2 could pocket an annual bonus of as much as £ 700,000 , on top of his £ 560,000 salary , £ 160,660 pension payments and £ 15,000 additional benefits			1
the news will infuriate commuters and train travellers facing huge hikes in rail fares for an ' inadequate service ' , in which trains are often overcrowded and more than 40 per cent do not arrive on time			2
the train company 's top bosses already receive bonuses of up to 60 per cent of their salary - but they have now brought in consultants from @entity31 to advise on pay packages			1
@entity31 said the average package in the ' outside world ' includes a yearly bonus of 75 per cent of an executive 's salary and a long - term bonus equivalent to half of their annual pay			1
it also said that @entity9 's pension benefits were at the median to lower end of the scale			0
the proposed pay package seen by the @entity46 would also push the take - home pay of three other @entity9 directors to more than £ 1million			1
operations director @entity49 , financial director @entity50 and infrastructure director @entity51 would all receive bonuses of around £ 450,000 a year , plus ' golden handcuff ' payments of £ 300,000 , intended to stop them leaving			2
they would also be handed long - term bonuses of up to £ 350,000 for 2009 - 2011 , while mr @entity2 does not qualify for this yet because he only got the top job in february 2011			1
top bosses : operations director @entity49 and finance director @entity50 would also receive bonuses of around £ 450,000 a year , ' golden handcuff ' payments of £ 300,000 to stop them leaving and long - term bonuses punctuality : the blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month - by - month ; the red line shows a moving annual average ; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule ( i.e. not precisely on time ) @entity76 transport secretary @entity75 said : ‘ commuters facing nine per cent fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry			1
‘ it will be unacceptable if payouts on this scale are made when performance remains deeply inadequate , with many passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains			0
‘ the government should sit down with @entity9 and look again at whether a bonus scheme on this scale is really appropriate in a company funded by the taxpayer by more than three billion pounds every year			0
’ the news comes after @entity9 bosses gave up their bonuses last year , amid pressure to reduce high payouts at a time of public sector austerity			0
@entity102 , head of the @entity104 rail union , said : ' while passengers struggle to cope with ever rising rail fares , it is simply scandalous that they should be looking to reward themselves with double your money bonuses at a publicly funded company			0
four bosses could be in line for pay packages of more than £ 1million , while customers face nine per cent fare hikes ' these executives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think the taxpayers are going to fund this blueprint to make themselves millionaires at our expense			1
' @entity9 executives are some of the highest paid in the public sector , as the head of its remuneration committee admitted at a meeting in december			0
but @entity128 stressed that they remain in the ' lower quartile ' of private sector organisations , and the company needs to be able to attract and retain top employees			0
a @entity9 spokesperson confirmed that @entity31 had offered advice to a meeting of its members , but said : ' no decision on bonuses has been made by the remuneration committee and therefore any figures are pure speculation			2
' our pay structure is agreed by the @entity144 and any future award of bonuses will depend on company performance			0
' the final pay packages will be agreed upon at a meeting in may or june .			2

would take annual pay packages of four bosses to more than £ 1million
they already receive yearly bonuses of 60 ***%*** of their salaries
consultants @entity31 said average in ' outside world ' was up to 75 ***%***
this is on top of pension , long - term bonuses and ' golden handcuffs '
comes as passengers face overcrowding , lateness and fare hikes
more than 40 ***%*** of trains arrive late , figures released last month *revealed*
