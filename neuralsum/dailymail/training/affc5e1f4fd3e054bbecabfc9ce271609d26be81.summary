a widely - used anti-depressant could help ease the symptoms of @entity4 's sufferers , a study has found			1
the drug citalopram - sold under the brand names @entity7 and @entity7 - significantly relieved agitation in a group of patients with the condition			1
it helped to reduce their emotional distress , excessive movement , aggression and disruptive irritability			2
treatment : @entity7 could help ease the symptoms of @entity4 's sufferers , a study has found			1
the drug - sold under the brand names @entity7 and @entity7 - significantly relieved agitation in patients with the condition the drug , known as @entity7 , was also found to be safer than the antipsychotic drugs currently used to treat the condition - with a lower risk of strokes or heart attacks			1
it was tested on 186 @entity4 's patients with varying symptoms during clinical trials at @entity33 and seven other @entity35 and @entity36 academic medical centres			1
researchers found the drug produced irregular heart beats in some patients - but the risk was lower than that of antipsychotic drugs			2
antipsychotics , which are often used as first - line medications for @entity4 ’s - related agitation , can significantly increase the risk of strokes , heart attacks and death in sufferers			2
benefits : it helped to reduce sufferers ' emotional distress , excessive movement and disruptive irritability dr @entity58 , who led the study , said the popular anti-depression could be a ' safer ' choice of medication for @entity4 's patients			1
' if the agitation is not responding to non-medication treatments and your patient ’s agitation is n’t improving , there are no great options , ' he said			0
' but here ’s another medication choice that might be safer than other medications and seems to be just as effective			0
' researcher : dr @entity58 said the popular anti-depression could also be a ' safer ' choice of medication for @entity4 's patients during the study , published in the @entity78 , patients initially underwent tests to define the extent of their agitation , memory and other cognitive skills			1
the stress levels of their caregivers were also measured as this is a factor strongly linked to the well - being of those with @entity4 ’s			0
the patients - all of whom had previously experienced no adequate symptom relief with non-medical therapies or other antipsychotic drugs - were then separated into two groups			2
over the next nine weeks , 50 per cent took increasing doses of citalopram that peaked at 30 milligrams per day , while the rest took a placebo			0
at the end of the study , the same set of tests was given , along with electrocardiograms			0
dr @entity58 said the results showed that 40 per cent of patients on @entity109 had experienced ' considerable ' relief from agitation symptoms - compared to just 26 per cent of patients who took the placebo			0
the caregivers for these patients also reported less stress			0
however , dr @entity58 said patients on the anti-depressant were found to have slightly decreased cognitive function - adding : ' it was not huge , but measureable			1
' patients on @entity7 also had longer @entity124 intervals - a measure of abnormal heart function that increases the risk of heart attacks			0
but dr @entity58 added antipsychotic medications also used to treat agitation increase heart attack risk as well - perhaps even more substantially			0
dr @entity58 and his colleagues now hope to carry out further tests to determine whether a lower dose of @entity7 might be just as effective in treating @entity4 ’s - related agitation - but with less risk for cognition and heart function .			2
