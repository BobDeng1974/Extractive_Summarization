by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 14:49 est , 11 june 2013 historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen @entity4 soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in @entity9 in 1914			1
the group of unknown soldiers , who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in @entity14 , @entity9 , could be identified thanks to dna provided by the great - nephew of private @entity18 , who was reported missing in action at the age of 20			1
it is believed private @entity18 could be one of the 15 found at the site in @entity9 in 2009			1
now , his great - nephew @entity24 , 61 , from @entity25 , has submitted a dna sample in the hope it matches with one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative			1
@entity24 has submitted a dna sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in @entity14 , @entity9 , belongs to his great uncle private @entity18 ( left and right , with his wife ) was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20			1
historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in @entity14 , @entity9 , in 2009 and historians from the @entity44 hope that after the dna testing has been undertaken , they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on			1
the remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009			2
private @entity18 , killed in action early in the @entity4 , may be identified nearly a century after his death archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes , and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the @entity60 - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009			1
one young soldier , private @entity18 , killed in action early in the @entity4 may be identified nearly a century after his death , from dna provided by his great - nephew , in one of the first dna tests on the soldier 's remains			1
the commission managed to track down private @entity18 ’s closest living relative , his great nephew mr @entity24 , and they are now awaiting the results of his dna test to see if @entity76 will be the first unknown soldier to be identified			1
mr @entity24 said : ' i had no idea that any of my relatives served in the @entity4			1
i feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country			1
' i was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20			1
' i have grandchildren that age myself , and i ca n’t even begin to imagine what those soldier ’s poor mothers went through			2
' i know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives			0
' i did n’t really know anything about my mother ’s side of the family			0
the number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year , but since 2003 the @entity104 has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year			0
over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found , while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011			2
each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time			0
the most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields			0
the vast majority of cases are in @entity9 and @entity124 in all instances , the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving			1
the commission ’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial			0
the commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest @entity139 in which there is space - manufacture the headstone , prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place			0
' i was very keen to give a dna sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes			1
' i ’ve been told it may take several months to come back with a result , but i hope i can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve			0
' i ’ve said that i would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men , even if it turns out not to be my uncle ’s remains			2
i feel as though i have a bond with those men now			0
' the @entity60 had been based in @entity162 at the outbreak of the war , landing in @entity9 on september 9 , 1914 , and taking part in the @entity166			2
the battalion then headed to fight with the @entity168 along a line from @entity170 to @entity171 in an action that lasted from october 20 to 31			2
all the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours , to mark the centenary of their deaths in october 2014			0
an @entity179 spokesman said : ' the use of dna can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered , but after many decades results may be inconclusive			0
we always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility			0
' dna testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases			0
' the @entity197 team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of @entity200 are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago			0
' historic find : @entity14 is situated to the west of @entity211 in @entity9			2
