by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 05:03 est , 18 august 2012 an aerial assault has been launched on the mosquito population of @entity3 for the first time in 45 years in a bid to combat the spread of deadly @entity8 virus			1
aircraft loaded with insecticide have sprayed parts of the north east of @entity13 , after the virus killed 10 people and left at least 230 more ill. although commonplace in other major cities , the efforts have provoked a debate in the @entity3 area between health officials trying to reduce the risk of disease and residents concerned about the dangers posed by the chemical cloud drifting down from above them			1
preparing for action : an aircraft carrying insecticide is loaded with fuel before taking off to spray parts of @entity13 as part of the battle against the spread of the @entity8 virus battle : an aircraft sprays insecticide over part of @entity13 ' i can not have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action , ' @entity3 mayor @entity38 said			1
aerial spraying is also being used elsewhere , including in neighborhoods in @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity48 , to combat the spread of @entity8 virus			1
cases of @entity8 have also been reported in the @entity52 area , with officials spraying the nearby town of @entity55 with insecticide			1
two people have been taken ill with the virus in @entity55 , while the @entity52 suburb of @entity60 has reported its first case			2
state of emergency : the culex quinquefasciatus mosquito is associated with transmission of the @entity8 virus nearly half of all @entity8 cases in the @entity67 so far this year are in @entity68 , however , according to the @entity69			1
if the trend continues , 2012 will be the worst @entity8 year in the southern state 's history			1
the hot , dry weather has created ideal conditions for some species of mosquito			1
the heat speeds up their life cycle , which accelerates the virus 's replication process			2
and during a drought , standing water can quickly turn stagnant when it 's not flushed away by rain or runoff			2
@entity3 mayor @entity38 , pictured with his wife @entity87 , has declared a state of emergency in his city parts of north @entity3 are being sprayed with insecticide to combat the spread of the virus a gravid trap ( left ) , in a field near @entity95 in @entity3 , is part of the mosquito control efforts by the @entity100 first lieutenant @entity99 ( right ) examines a mosquito through a microscope at the @entity103 in @entity104 ( file picture ) @entity106 , mosquito technician at @entity108 , holds a trap while collecting mosquitoes covering up : @entity111 is seen wading into waist - deep water to guide protective tarps over koi ponds at the @entity115 ponds ' protection : the arboretum had crews out working to cover about 8,000 square feet of ponds with tarps to protect the aquatic ecosystems from insecticide that will be sprayed over the city from aircraft both the mayor and @entity13 judge @entity127 have declared a state of emergency and voiced their support for the use of aircraft to battle the virus			1
yet even with the threat of infection , the spraying has sparked widespread opposition from people who fear the chemicals could be harmful			2
because of the severity of the outbreak , the @entity139 is stepping in to oversee the effort and to pay for it			0
research : mosquito technician @entity145 looks through the mosquitos as local , state and federal officials are set to meet to discuss options for responding to the growing number of @entity8 cases prevention : the mosquitoes seen in a laboratory will help researchers fight the disease 's spread sorting : these dead mosquitoes await sorting at the @entity13 mosquito lab ' this year is totally different from the experience @entity68 has had in the past , ' state health commissioner dr. @entity159 said			1
' if it 's nuisance mosquitoes , we ask the city or county to pay part of that			2
but in the midst of this disease outbreak , it 's easier for us to go ahead and do it			0
' a national spraying company called @entity173 was set to deploy two to five @entity175 twin - engine planes for three hours of spraying			0
close eye : mosquito tech @entity177 is seen sorting the mosquitoes beneath a microscope at the @entity13 mosquito lab critics have questioned whether the approach is scientifically proven to reduce @entity8 cases			1
but at least one study in @entity48 concluded that the odds of infection are about six times lower in treated areas than in those that are untreated			0
still , some residents fear the chemicals could harm their children , pets and useful insects such as honeybees and ladybugs			0
plans : @entity3 mayor @entity38 talks about aerial spraying to curb the spread of @entity8 virus while standing before one of the @entity175 aircraft being used to administer the insecticide @entity205 areas : a map of @entity13 highlights the areas that were planned to be sprayed by air on thursday night @entity209 released from the planes , synthetic pyrethroid , mimics a naturally occurring substance found in chrysanthemums			1
the @entity214 has said that pyrethroids do not pose a significant risk to wildlife or the environment , though no pesticide is 100 percent safe			2
about eight - tenths of an ounce of chemical is applied per acre			0
the insecticide 's common name is @entity225			2
dr @entity159 , commissioner with the @entity226 , speaks to area media about the spraying of mosquitoes in @entity13 @entity8 ( @entity8 ) is found in both temperate and tropical regions , having been first identified in the @entity8 region of @entity232 in 1937			1
it mainly infects birds and horses , and human infection is almost always transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito			0
symptoms include fever , headache , excessive sweating ) , weakness , drowsiness and , pain in the joints			0
stronger strains of the virus can inuce nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea			0
the most dangerous form can lead to unconsciousness , sometimes approaching near - coma , and death			0
up to 80 per cent of human infections do not show any symptoms			0
@entity8 emerged as a distinct virus around 1,000 years ago , developing into two distinct forms			1
one has been transmitted in @entity259 and around the world , while the other has been confined to @entity259 - although it has been recently detected in horses @entity262			0
the label says it 's toxic to fish and other types of aquatic life , and it contains distilled petroleum			0
@entity269 , who lives in @entity3 and works for an environmental consulting firm , has questioned the move			1
' one ounce an acre does n't sound like much , but we will spray at least 2,000 gallons all over the city , ' @entity269 said			2
' a 2,000 - gallon oil spill would be significant			0
' i 'm concerned that we 're breeding resistant mosquitoes that next time will have @entity280 fever or something worse			1
' @entity283 , which includes humid , mosquito - filled @entity284 , has used aerial spraying once a year since 2002 , the year the virus was first detected in @entity68			1
' we ca n't be everywhere at all times , ' mosquito control director dr. @entity286 said			0
' aerial treatment is a way to supplement what we do on the ground			0
' most people infected with @entity8 virus wo n't get sick , but about one in 150 people will develop the severe form of the illness			1
symptoms include headache , high fever , neck stiffness , disorientation , coma , tremors , convulsions , muscle weakness and paralysis			0
@entity307 , 14 , spent eight days in intensive care with the most severe form of @entity8 virus			1
her mother , @entity310 of @entity312 , said she does n't approve of aerial spraying and wishes local leaders would do more to educate the community			0
' we 've been desensitized to @entity8 virus , ' mrs @entity310 said			2
' it 's been ingrained in us that it affects older people and infants			0
' i think they need to pass out insect repellent , mention it in back - to - school drives			0

@entity327 used to spray mosquitoes with insecticide over @entity3 for the first time in nearly 50 years
around half of all cases of @entity8 in the @entity67 this year have been in @entity68
hot , dry weather has created an ideal environment for the mosquitoes to breed
