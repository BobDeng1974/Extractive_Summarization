by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 4 december 2012 it looks more suited to the battlefield of @entity3 to protect against the volleys of @entity6 arrows			0
but this medieval - style chain mail mask is actually a rare survivor of the @entity9 of the @entity10			0
it was worn by the pioneering @entity13 tank drivers at the @entity14 in 1917			1
masked men : tanks were first deployed in 1917 to break the stalemate of trench warfare and suitable protection had to be created the vehicles , which were still in their infancy as machines of war , were piloted from fume - filled cabins			1
and the drivers were often at risk of taking red hot shards of metal in the face as enemy machine gun fire and shells smashed into the exterior			1
and so these masks were designed to protect the drivers faces and eyes in the heat of @entity37 , very few survived the war			1
the face mask is expected to fetch Â£ 600 when it comes up for auction at @entity42 , in @entity43 , @entity44 , on wednesday			2
tanks were developed during the @entity10 in bid to break the stalemate of trench warfare			0
a prototype vehicle , nicknamed @entity50 , was constructed by the @entity13 company @entity51 , during august and september , 1915			0
chain drivers : the mask was designed to protect the tank drivers from flying shrapnel when their vehicles came under fire @entity59 soldiers dig out a @entity13 tank that became stuck behind enemy lines after the counter-offensive at @entity14 the headgear resembles that worn by soldiers down the centuries			1
pictured is a suit of armour from 17th century @entity68 this provided the basis for the @entity71 that was demonstrated to the @entity72 on february 2 , 1916			0
although initially called ' land ships ' , the vehicles were nicknamed ' tanks ' to preserve secrecy after it became known that the factory workers referred to the first prototype as ' the tank ' because of its resemblance to a steel water tank			2
the heavily shelled terrain around the trenches and in no - man 's land was impassable to conventional vehicles			0
the @entity71 's rhomboid shape , caterpillar tracks , and 26 feet length meant that it could navigate obstacles , especially wide trenches , that wheeled vehicles could not			0
however , the first tanks were highly unreliable , with a number of mechanical problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit			0
by the time of the battle of @entity14 in november / december 1917 , the @entity13 had already used more than 200 tanks in @entity101 in june and july			1
the @entity6 , meanwhile , had deployed large numbers in april , may and october of that year			2
battlelines : tanks were developed in a bid to end the stalemate of trench warfare of the @entity9 but @entity14 was the first time they were used in significant force , with a battleplan especially designed to utilise the new capability those deployed by the @entity13 at @entity14 were @entity115 tanks and despite initial success , @entity59 artillery and infantry defences exposed the frailties of their armour and the vehicles became mostly ineffective after the first day			1
tank design gradually improved in the inter-war period and during the @entity127 , where they had once been used to support infantry , the concept of @entity124 made tanks a formidable branch of the army in their own right			2
efore the end of the war , tanks had surpassed infantry as the most important force on the battlefield			2
the battle of @entity14 started well for the @entity13 forces , before they were defeated by a @entity59 counter-attack the @entity14 proved to be a significant event in the @entity10			1
the town itself was important because it contained a strategic railhead and was near the @entity147 - the @entity59 ' vast network of defences in northeastern @entity6			0
and so , as the battle of @entity151 was being fought , @entity149 approved a plan to take on the @entity59 by sweeping round the back of @entity14 and encircling the town			1
it was the first battle in which tanks were used en masse , with the @entity13 deploying a mixture of tanks , heavy artillery and air power - though some in the military did not yet believe that tanks were effective in battle			1
suddenly there was place for mobility on the battlefield - and despite the problems encountered by the @entity13 and the @entity59 speed at countering the threat from the tanks , the nature of the war was changed			2
the @entity13 plan included an attack on the @entity147 and the use of three cavalry divisions that would encircle @entity14 , thus cutting it off			1
while @entity149 's plan won the approval of some , others were less than inspired that it included tanks as these new weapons had yet to prove their worth in battle in the eyes of some			2
the attack started at 6.20am on november 20 , 1917 with an intense artillery attack directly on the @entity147 , which surprised the @entity59			2
then 350 @entity13 tanks began their advance across the ground supported by infantry - both were assisted by an artillery rolling barrage that gave them cover from a @entity59 counter-attack			0
the bulk of the initial attack went well			0
the @entity199 ( @entity200 ) covered more than five miles in this attack from their starting point			0
compared to the gains made at battles such as the @entity206 and @entity207 , such a distance was astonishing			0
defeated : a @entity13 tank that had been destroyed during the battle of @entity14 however , not everything had gone to plan when a tank crossing the @entity212 broke the bridge that the the @entity214 were supposed to use to advance to @entity14			1
elsewhere , @entity13 units got bogged down in their attack , becoming isolated and seeing the command structure break down			0
by november 30 , the @entity59 were ready to counter-attack and defend @entity14			1
this was so effective that on december 3 , @entity149 gave the order for the @entity13 units still near to @entity14 to withdraw ' with the least possible delay from the @entity222 to a more retired and shorter line '			1
while losses did not equate to the @entity206 or @entity207 , the @entity13 lost over 44,000 men during the battle while the @entity59 lost about 45,000 men			0
the initial phase of the battle did show that mobility was possible in the war but that to sustain it , a decent command structure was needed to coordinate best to take advantage of the situations			1
and the failure to build on the initial success of the attack was blamed on the @entity13 middle - ranking commanders - some of whom were sacked			0
battlefield : @entity14 lay on the @entity9 , not far from the border of @entity6 and @entity59			1

face protectors were given to tank operators at @entity14 in 1917
it was the first battle that the new machines were deployed en masse in war
