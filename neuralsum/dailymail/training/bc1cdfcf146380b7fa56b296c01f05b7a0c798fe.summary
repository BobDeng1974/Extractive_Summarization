a 23 - year - old man and his parents have been left with a debilitating gastric illness after falling ill during a dream family holiday to @entity4 almost two years ago			0
the @entity6 family , from @entity7 , @entity8 , travelled to the @entity9 in @entity10 for what they hoped would be a relaxing two - week break in july 2013			2

' we were all concerned by the food hygiene standards and we felt that the facilities were shabby and not what you might expect from a five - star resort , ' says @entity20 , who works as an administrator			0
' we tried to make the best of things , but in the second week it was as if we were dropping like flies , one by one falling ill with horrendous symptoms			0
it was an absolute nightmare			0
' the family believes that under - cooked chicken from a barbecue may have been to blame for their illness			2
the family of six were travelled to the @entity9 in @entity10 for what they hoped would be a relaxing two - week break in july 2013 ' i have been diagnosed with @entity27 which means i now have to be more careful about the foods i eat and it can be very restrictive and my mum and dad have also still got some symptoms			2
the tour operator @entity61 has now admitted liability , allowing the family to pursue a legal complaint and seek to compensation for their misery			1
' we are pleased that the tour operator has admitted liability as it means we are now one step closer to gaining justice , ' say @entity20			1
