rising numbers of part - time gps are contributing to a recruitment crisis in the @entity4 , a report has warned			1
more than half of family doctors are women and many work only a few days a week , while more male doctors are choosing to go part - time as they juggle managerial roles			1
in a report published in the @entity16 , professor @entity12 , who specialises in primary care at the @entity14 , said the @entity4 urgently needed to boost @entity18 numbers			1
burning out : many gps quit the profession well before retirement age , a @entity16 report said ( posed by models ) she said : ‘ we have too few @entity20 , and those we do have are stressed , burning out , and feeling increasingly unable to deliver healthcare safely			1
’ earlier this year figures from the @entity28 showed the number of women @entity20 had overtaken men for the first time			0
there are now 20,440 females – a rise of 50 per cent in a decade – compared with 19,800 men			0
many women work less after having children and eventually leave the profession altogether , often blaming the long hours			2
shifting trends : male gps are becoming a rarer sight , the report published today found ( posed by models ) only last month the @entity45 warned that as many as 500 surgeries could close across @entity47 as so many gps are nearing retirement			2
professor @entity50 added : ‘ they are not being replaced by younger doctors as it is deemed highly stressful and unrewarding			0
‘ we need a coherent plan for workforce development in primary care , taking into account undergraduate and postgraduate training and beyond , with a robust funding plan that is flexible enough to reflect the local population ’s needs but big enough to prevent further disintegration and a lack of investment			0

many work a few days a week and quit profession well before retirement
