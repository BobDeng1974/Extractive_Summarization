for years , websites have been criticised for carrying out hidden - and in some cases - underhand techniques to lure in customers			0
and despite a number of high - profile reports , involving sites such as @entity8 and @entity9 , a new study has revealed many of these personalisation methods are still taking place			2
researchers examined prices across 16 different retailers and found that some show different prices to different users based on where they live , whether they ’re searching on a pc or phone , and even based on what they have paid for items previously			1
they discovered evidence of price discrimination and steering , based on a user 's location of browsing history it is not known whether the practice is a worldwide phenomenon or whether the results observed in the study are confined to businesses in the @entity30			1
‘ people have a mental model of shopping that is based on experiences from brick - and - mortar stores , ’ explained @entity48 , assistant professor of @entity49 at @entity26 on @entity50			0
‘ many people assume this same mental model of shopping applies just as well to e-commerce websites			0
however , as we are discovering , this is not the case			0
’ in 2010 , @entity8 ’s chief executive @entity62 admitted an experiment , in which the site charged different users different prices for the same dvd , was ‘ a mistake			2
’ it ’s a practice known as price discrimination or price differentiation			1
to avoid price differences , researchers advise searching for products using a private or incognito browser window on a pc or mobile			1
this means companies do n’t know what sites and products have previously been searched for , or how much users paid for items			1
it also means they do n’t know what platform is being used to search the sites			2
by deleting cache and stored cookie data also removes personalisation options			0
to make sure websites do n't track future cookies they can also be disabled through a browser 's settings menu			0
be aware that removing cookies will also mean stored passwords , personalised adverts and choices wo n't appear			0
in 2012 , the @entity98 revealed @entity9 was charging users different prices based on their geographic location			2
it also reported that travel retailer @entity103 was showing more expensive hotels to users browsing from @entity107 computers , known as price steering			1
to see if these practices are still being used , and how extensively , assistant professor @entity48 and his colleagues examined ten major @entity30 retailers along with six hotel and rental car sites			1
this included @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity34 , @entity118 , @entity120 ’s @entity119 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity9 , @entity33 , @entity123 , @entity35 , @entity124 , @entity103 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
they then recruited 300 people to run product searches on the 16 sites			2
the researchers paired each of these real users , who each had their own real , browser history , with an automated browser that ran the same searches at the same time as the real users , but did not store any cookies			2
by comparing the search results shown to these automated controls , and to the real users , they identified a number of cases of personalisation			1
‘ we saw price steering from @entity122 , with the order of search results varying from user to user , ' said the study			1
researchers examined ten major @entity30 retailers along with six hotel and rental car sites			1
they then recruited 300 people to run product searches on 16 sites			2
@entity123 ( pictured ) presented different results to guests ( top ) , and unadvertised ' members only ' prices to logged - in users ( bottom ) this chart reveals which sites showed products with different prices			1
a desktop user searching @entity34 , for example , typically received 24 search results , with an average price per item of $ 120 ( £ 75 )			1
mobile users received 48 search results , with an average price per item of $ 230 ( £ 143 ) ‘ [ and ] we saw price discrimination from @entity34 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity103 , @entity125 , @entity35 , and @entity126 , with product prices varying from user to user			1
’ to figure out what , in particular , was being used to personalise results , the researchers conducted a second experiment , using fake accounts			2
in 2010 , @entity8 ’s chief executive @entity62 admitted an experiment , in which the site charged different users different prices for the same dvd , was ‘ a mistake			2
’ it ’s a practice known as price discrimination or price differentiation			1
in 2012 , the @entity98 revealed @entity9 was charging users different prices based on their geographic location			2
it also reported that travel retailer @entity103 was showing more expensive hotels to users browsing from @entity107 computers , known as price steering			1
there is also a technique known as a / b testing			0
by dividing visitors into different groups , companies are able to use these tests to see how users respond to new website features and algorithms			2
during tests , for example , visitors to @entity35 and @entity124 were randomly assigned to groups a , @entity218 , or c based on the cookies stored on their computers , said the researchers			0
users in groups a and b were shown hotels with an average price of $ 187 per night ( £ 116 ) while users in group c were shown hotels with an average price of $ 170 per night ( £ 106 )			1
they tested personalisation using a range of browsers , including @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 as well as different platforms , including @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242			0
they also tried searching for deals while logged into an account , and as guests			0
using one account , the researchers booked cheap hotels and rentals cars , while the other booked more expensive rooms and cars			0
‘ our fake accounts uncovered many different personalisation strategies employed by sites , ’ said the researchers			2
for example , @entity126 reduced the prices on 5 per cent of hotel rooms shown in search results by around $ 15 ( £ 9 ) per night when searched for on @entity241 or @entity242			1
cheaptickets and @entity103 gave unadvertised ‘ members only ’ discounts of about $ 12 ( £ 7.50 ) per night on 5 per cent of hotels rooms to users who were logged in to their accounts on the site			1
meanwhile , @entity35 and @entity124 used what marketers and engineers call ‘ a / b tests ’ to steer certain users towards more expensive hotels			0
by dividing visitors into different groups , companies are able to use these tests to see how users respond to new website features and algorithms			0
in this case , for example , visitors to @entity35 and @entity124 were randomly assigned to groups a , @entity218 , or c based on the cookies stored on their computers , said the researchers			0
users in groups a and b were shown hotels with an average price of $ 187 per night ( £ 116 ) while users in group c were shown hotels with an average price of $ 170 per night ( £ 106 )			1
@entity34 served almost completely different products to users on desktops versus mobile devices			1
a desktop user searching @entity34 typically received 24 search results , with an average price per item of $ 120 ( £ 75 )			1
in contrast , mobile users receive 48 search results , with an average price per item of $ 230 ( £ 143 )			1
many personalisation techniques are based on cookies			0
cookies are small files stored on a user 's computer or phone , filled with data about that particular person			0
they are used to set prices and show adverts , for example			0
cookies are also used by sites such as @entity323 ( pictured ) to personalise what films and shows are prioritised products were also 41 cents ( 25p ) more expensive , on average , for @entity242 users			2
‘ initially , we assumed the sites would not personalise content , given the extremely negative @entity333 that @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity103 received when earlier cases were revealed , ’ continued the researchers			1
‘ to our surprise , this was not the case			0
unfortunately , the business logic underlying much of this personalisation remains a mystery			0
many personalisation techniques used by websites are based on cookies			0
cookies are small files stored on a user 's computer or phone , filled with data about that particular person			0
when a user visits a website that tracks cookies , the site scans this data to learn more about the potential customer			0
websites legally have to inform users if they use cookies , and these cookies can be removed or disabled using a browser 's settings			0
it is n't just used to set prices and show adverts , for example			0
the cookies are also used by sites such as @entity323 to personalise what films and shows are prioritised			0
some store login details so people do n't have to enter their username and password each time they visit the site			0
‘ none of the discounts we located in our experiments were advertised on sites ' homepages , so the deals do not appear to be part of marketing campaigns			0
’ @entity103 and @entity35 confirmed the researcher ’s findings , but did not explain why their websites are designed in this way			1
@entity126 confirmed it offers deals for mobile users , with the goal being to motivate them to use the site more and install the @entity126 app. ‘ what is clear from our study is that price discrimination and steering on e-commerce sites is becoming more prevalent , and more sophisticated , ’ added assistant professor @entity48			1
‘ as a user , it ’s almost impossible to know if the prices you are being shown have been altered , or if cheaper products have been hidden from search results			1
’ the researchers advise searching for products in a desktop browser , or using a private or incognito browser window on a pc or mobile browser			1
this means companies do n’t know what sites and products have previously been searched for , or how much users paid for items			2
it also means they do n’t know what platform is being used to search the sites			2
‘ companies are constantly experimenting with new personalisation techniques , so in the future , an entirely different attribute may trigger personalisation , ’ concluded the researchers			0
‘ ultimately , we hope that our study will encourage companies to be more transparent about how they personalise prices and search results			1
‘ rather than using opaque and creepy algorithms to secretly alter content , companies could stick to the kinds of real - world incentives that shoppers already know and love , like coupons and sales			0

researchers studied prices on ten retail and six hotel and rental car sites
when using a mobile , @entity126 prices were 5 *%* cheaper than on a pc
cheaptickets and @entity103 gave unadvertised offers to logged in users
desktop user on @entity34 received 24 search results , with an average price of $ 120 ( £ 75 )
mobile users received 48 search results , with an average price of $ 230 ( £ 143 )
these practices are known as price discrimination , and steering
affected sites confirmed results found in the study , but did n’t explain why
