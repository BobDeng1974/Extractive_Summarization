by @entity0 a millionaire businessman known as ' the @entity2 ' turned the tables on a hacker who was attempting to blackmail him by offering $ 20,000 worth of the digital currency as a reward for his capture			1
@entity12 born @entity11 has amassed a small fortune in @entity14 after investing heavily from 2011 and using the currency , which has since exploded in value , to back a number of start - up firms			1
but last week he received a threatening message from a hacker known as @entity21 who had taken control of an old @entity24 account using it to steal personal information including mr @entity11 's social security and passport numbers			1
@entity2 : @entity12 businessman @entity11 turned the tables on a hacker who had broken into one of his old email accounts and was trying to blackmail him @entity21 then threatened to sell the information to fraudsters unless mr @entity11 paid him 37 bitcoins - worth a cool $ 20,000 , @entity36 reports			1
although mr @entity11 is believed to be easily be able to afford such a sum , he refused to pay up and instead used @entity38 to offer the same amount as a reward for information that would lead to @entity21 's arrest			1
while @entity14 is often trumpeted as simply being a libertarian currency and way to move money across international boundaries it is heavily linked to the sinister online marketplace @entity49 where drugs , guns and even hitmen are offered for sale			1
soon after the bounty was placed on @entity38 a clearly terrifed @entity21 backed down contacting mr @entity11 with a cowering apology			1
he wrote : ' sir , i am sincerely sorry			0
i am just a middleman			0
i was being told what to tell you			0
' are you going to order a hitman to kill me now ? ' response : mr @entity11 posted this message on @entity38 after which the hacker quickly backed down it was a far cry from the blackmailer 's original messages in which he brazenly threatened to exploit mr @entity11 after seizing control of the old email account which mr @entity11 had used several years ago to register the internet domain memorydealers.com for his computer parts business			1
after taking over the account @entity21 was not only able to access mr @entity11 's personal information but also that of his mother which he threatened to sell to ' fraudsters ' who would ' ruin both of your lives '			1
' i think we both know this wo n’t be pleasent [ sic ] and let ’s be honest : there is nothing you can do to have me caught			0
i ’ve been around too long , ' @entity21 wrote , before adding : ' i have to say : i respect you as a @entity14 user / icon			1
' let 's be honest i will sell your information to fraudsters that will credit f * * * you then get your moms social and credit f * * * her too and ruin both your lives			2
' ' 37.6 @entity14 is n't worth s * * * to you , the damage i cause to you financially / family-wise will be way worse than that			2
' mr @entity11 , who is now based in @entity106 , decided to stall for time , attempting to negotiate with @entity108 , while he and close associate @entity109 , chief hacking officer of @entity106 security startup @entity110 , attempted to wrestle back control of the hacked accounts			1
after an hour - long exchange through @entity115 , @entity108 attempted to up the ante , threatening to ' own ' @entity11 10,0000 times harder			2
demand : @entity21 was asking for 37 @entity14 - worth $ 20,000 - from mr @entity11 after hacking into his email account ' you fag , ' he wrote			1
' listen , my mom needs a liver transplant that starts at $ 15,000 , man … i am so sorry for having to do this , but it ’s just what i have to do			0
' but @entity11 cooly responded by posting a link to the @entity38 post offering the reward and @entity21 quickly backed down			1
he then wrote : ' sir , i am sincerely sorry i am just a middleman i was being told what to tell you			0
' i was seriously being told what to tell you by someone else i do n't even know what 's going on			2
' please stop i am so sorry i told him that you are now going to have me killed over something he made me do i did n't even do this it was someone else			0
' mr @entity11 said he has not been contacted by the hacker since			1
what is a bitcoin ? bitcoins are basically just lines of computer code that are digitally signed each time they travel from one owner to the next			0
they are the basic unit of a new online economy which runs independently of any company , bank , or government			0
because bitcoins allow people to trade money without a third party getting involved , they have become popular with libertarians as well as technophiles , speculators — and criminals			0
who 's behind the currency ? it 's a mystery			2
@entity14 was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name @entity170 and then adopted by a small clutch of @entity172 dropped off the map as @entity14 began to attract widespread attention , but proponents say that does n't matter ; the currency obeys its own , internal logic			1
what 's a bitcoin worth ? like any other currency , bitcoins are only worth as much as you and your counterpart want them to be			2
in its early days , boosters swapped bitcoins back and forth for minor favors or just as a game			0
one website even gave them away for free			0
as the market matured , the value of each bitcoin grew			0
is the currency widely used ? that 's debatable			2
businesses ranging from blogging platform @entity197 to retailer @entity199 have jumped on the @entity14 bandwagon amid a flurry of media coverage , but it 's not clear whether the currency has really taken off			1
on the one hand , leading bitcoin payment processor @entity204 works with more than 20,000 businesses — roughly five times more than it did last year			0
on the other , the total number of bitcoin transactions has stayed roughly constant at between 60,000 and 70,000 per day over the same period , according to bitcoin wallet site blockchain.info			0
is @entity14 particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting ? the @entity14 network works by harnessing individuals ' greed for the collective good			2
a network of tech - savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain , a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction			2
the blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice , and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional bitcoin			0
as long as miners keep the blockchain secure , counterfeiting should n't be an issue .			0
