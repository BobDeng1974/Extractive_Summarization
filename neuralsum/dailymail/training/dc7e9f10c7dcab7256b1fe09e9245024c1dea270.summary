@entity0 , who co-founded the @entity1 , claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science climate change has been proven to be a lie , according to a leading meteorologist			1
@entity0 , who co-founded the @entity1 , claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science			1
in an open letter attacking the @entity12 , the 80 - year - old from @entity14 , said that what ' little evidence ' there is for global warming points to natural cycles in temperature			1
' there is no climate crisis , ' he wrote			2
' the ocean is not rising significantly			2
the polar ice is increasing , not melting away			0
polar bears are increasing in number			0
' heat waves have actually diminished , not increased			0
there is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms			0
' i have studied this topic seriously for years			0
it has become a political and environment agenda item , but the science is not valid			0
' according to @entity38 , mr @entity0 based his research on the findings of the @entity41 , a non-governmental international body of scientists			1
their role is to offer an second opinion of the evidence reviewed by the @entity12 's @entity48 ( @entity48 )			1
' there is no significant man - made global warming at this time , there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future , ' added mr @entity0			1
' efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed			2
' there has been no warming over 18 years			0
pictured is @entity0 , @entity1 founder dr @entity76 tweeted this provocative statement after a @entity79 study found methane leaking beneath the @entity81 the planet is ' f * * cked ' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor			1
this is according to dr @entity76 who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere			1
he said : ' if even a small fraction of @entity81 sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere , we 're f 'd ' the scientist , based at the @entity98 and @entity99 , tweeted the provocative statement after a @entity79 study found methane leaking beneath the @entity81			0
some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than @entity103 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean 's surface			2
the leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature			0
scientists at @entity117 called the discovery ' somewhat of a surprise , ' which , according to dr box , is an understatement			0
' we 're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario , and we need to get off it , ' dr @entity76 told @entity125 at @entity126 ' we 're f * * ked at a certain point , right ? it just becomes unmanageable			0
the climate dragon is being poked , and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place			2
' the @entity48 has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks			1
the report said that violent conflicts , food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years			0
it also claimed that the world is in ' an era of man - made climate change ' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans			1
it highlighted that in recent decades , @entity151 has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall , and reductions in wheat and maize yields			0
in the wake of the report 's publication there were renewed calls from scientists and campaigners for action to cut greenhouse gases and to help vulnerable people adapt to already - unavoidable impacts of climate change			1

the report said that violent conflicts , food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years @entity0 ( left ) , is pictured here in 1981 as @entity183 's @entity182 ' meteorologist			1
he claims ' rfforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed			2
there has been no warming over 18 years ' in order to minimise the risk of human interference in the climate system , the international community has agreed limit temperature rise to 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels			0
' we live in an era of man - made climate change , ' said @entity203 , co-chair of the @entity48 study on climate change impacts , vulnerabilities and adaptation , from the @entity208 , @entity209			1
at the time of the report , one of its contributors has accused the @entity48 of being too ' alarmist ' – and demanded his name be withdrawn			2
professor @entity216 , an economist at the @entity217 , said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more ' apocalyptic '			0
he said colleagues ' drifted too far to the alarmist side ' and were likening climate change to the ' @entity223 '			1
projected temperature change from 2081 - 2100			2
for the first time , the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers			0
top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems , such as civil wars , strife between nations and refugees the rising risk of catastrophic events linked with rising temperatures is shown in this graphic by the @entity48			1

80 - year - old , who founded @entity1 , claims oceans are not rising
what ' little evidence ' there is points to natural weather cycles , he said
*earlier* this year , the @entity48 warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks
