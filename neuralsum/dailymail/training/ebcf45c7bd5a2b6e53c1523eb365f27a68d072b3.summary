click here for all the stats from the @entity3 ' @entity2 win over the @entity4 on tuesday night it 's what you might term an upset , though you suspect @entity9 ca n’t have been too devastated			1
not when he made 10 changes to the side he fielded in his most recent @entity15 fixture			1
a cheer for the plucky underdog , then ? not quite			0
@entity18 made the same number of changes			1
what a strange state of affairs , when a last - 16 cup tie ca n’t draw full enthusiasm from either club			2
more so when each manager would have been entitled to believe they had a good shot at a quarter - final place			2
that fate ultimately belongs to @entity18 , who have reached the last eight of the @entity2 for the first time in their history			1
@entity18 's @entity35 celebrates scoring the opening goal against @entity4 in the @entity2 @entity38 side foots his shot into the back of the net to give his championship side the lead against their top flight opponents @entity18 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : camp 6.5 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 7.5 , @entity51 6 , @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 , 6 ) ; @entity56 6 ( @entity57 88 ) , @entity54 7 ( @entity55 70 , 7 )			1

@entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 5.5 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 5.5 , @entity70 5.5 ( @entity71 63 , 5.5 ) ; @entity72 6 ( @entity73 75 ) ; @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 5.5 ( @entity76 55 , 5.5 )			1
subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81			0
booked : @entity65 , @entity68			0
man of the match : @entity50			0
the manner of the finale was suitably dramatic			0
@entity50 had seemingly done enough to put @entity18 through with a strike early in the second half , only for @entity76 to level with a shot that deflected heavily off @entity46			1
that appeared to be that for a side that has achieved so much in recent years , but then it got a little sweeter when , within seconds of the restart , substitute @entity55 scored the winner			1
it might even make this competition attractive to @entity18			1
of course , it will need to be balanced against those priorities in the @entity101 , in which they are currently sitting an impressive fourth after a scarcely believable 8 - 0 win away at @entity104 at the weekend			1
@entity105 only retained @entity46 from that team ; @entity9 kept @entity65 from the 11 who started in the draw against @entity109			1
as it transpired , the opportunity of game time brought decent performances from players of both sides			0
within two minutes , @entity56 lashed a shot from distance that @entity63 saved and moments later @entity65 was forced to haul down @entity54 to prevent a breakaway			0
the fact @entity68 committed a similar offence later in the half said plenty about @entity54 ’s pace on the counter , which was evidently @entity18 ’s main ploy			2
at the other end , @entity4 threatened without looking dangerous			2
scoring hasn ’ t been a problem for them in the @entity15 – a tally of 12 that stands up to scrutiny against their rivals in the bottom half - but for a time here they looked ponderous			0
@entity4 's @entity72 ( right ) beats @entity51 during their fourth round clash at @entity134 on tuesday substitute @entity76 does n't celebrate after his cross leads to an own goal equaliser for @entity4 @entity46 was unlucky to have crept @entity76 's cross past @entity3 keeper @entity138 nothing too blatant at set - pieces			1
@entity141 @entity142 and @entity66 were both happy to get close at corners for @entity4 , but nothing especially untoward			2
when @entity64 crossed from the right , @entity70 slipped his marker but barely connected with his header			0
@entity74 also played in @entity147 , but the £ 10million striker shot straight at @entity138			0
they started the second half with a shade more incision , @entity72 sidestepping a challenge and dipping a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area			0
but by the 49th minute they were behind			1
considering they came into the fixture with a single away win this season and only one draw , perhaps it should not have been a surprise			0
@entity49 made the goal , surging at a backline that kept on retreating			2
he reached the edge of the area unchallenged and slipped a pass left to @entity50 , who shot across @entity169 and inside the far post			0
@entity52 then came close to making it 2 - 0			1
the winger ’s pace caused @entity4 problems most of the night but his finishing let him down when @entity45 found space on the right and drilled a low cross towards the penalty spot			1
@entity52 controlled with his back to goal , but in shooting on the turn miscued horribly			2
@entity76 levelled after 85 minutes with a heavily deflected shot from the left , but substitute @entity55 hit the winner seconds later			1
@entity105 threw his hands in the air			0
he has overseen a special time at @entity18			2
he took the club into the @entity101 in his first season at the club and consolidated their status by finishing 10th in the last campaign			2
at the weekend , they obliterated @entity104 and sit in the play - off places			1
now they are in a hat with only seven other numbers			0
not bad for a second string from the second tier			0
the @entity3 hit back straight away though through @entity55 for his 11th goal of the season @entity55 's strike , the second for the @entity3 , puts his side through to the @entity2 quarter - finals for the first time @entity55 claps after his goal that ensured @entity18 followed their 8 - 0 win over @entity104 with a @entity15 scalp @entity18 manager @entity105 ( left ) celebrates the upset win with matchwinner @entity55 ( right ) @entity211 shows his disappointment as @entity4 are ousted from the @entity2			1

@entity35 gave @entity18 the lead against @entity4 in the 49th minute
substitute @entity76 's cross deflected off @entity46 for an own goal equaliser
but @entity55 , also a substitute , struck back almost immediately for the hosts to *reclaim* the lead
both sides made 10 changes each to their *respective* line - ups from the weekend 's games
@entity18 had beaten @entity104 8 - 0 in the @entity101 three days *ago*
