by @entity1 reporter evangelical painter @entity2 once was revered amongst @entity3 as the ' @entity2 , ' known for his sentimental scenes of country gardens and pastoral landscapes that led to a commercial empire worth $ 100 million a year			1
his life - and ultimately his death - was much less pious , and far-less glamorous			2
published reports about the years leading up to the troubled artist 's death paint a much different picture than the heavenly landscapes that earned @entity2 millions - it includes drugs , alcohol , ' territorial urination ' and sexual harassment			1
but his heart had grown so enlarged he had been vulnerable to a fatal heart attack at any point , according to the autopsy			2
in the years leading up to his death he had run into personal difficulties , including a 2010 bankruptcy filing by one of his companies and an arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence that same year outside @entity47 , @entity48			2
@entity2 had been estranged from his wife of 30 years , @entity49 , at the time of his death , and his body was found in the bed he shared with his girlfriend of 18 months , @entity54 at his @entity56 home , four hours after he was last known to be alive , said @entity57 , @entity35 's lead medical examiner			1
some of his fingernails still held a residue of green paint , and his toenails were polished a glittery gold , the autopsy report said			0
@entity64 : @entity2 was arrested for driving while intoxicated , which was just one of his many public embarrassments , many of which were alcohol - related @entity57 described the 6 - foot , 254 - pound @entity2 as mildly obese and noted that he suffered from systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease			1
' his heart was so big that at any time he was vulnerable , ' @entity57 said			0
' apparently he had given up drinking and maybe he had just started again			0
his levels were definitely in the toxic range			0
' several other drugs , including two other prescription tranquilizers , were present in his bloodstream			0
@entity2 's urine contained gamma - hydroxybutyric acid , or @entity80 , which occurs naturally in the human body but can also be used as the so - called date rape drug			1
@entity57 said the painter also had suffered several remote blunt force injuries			0
' he had a bruise of his abdomen that was healing , a bruise under his scalp , a hemorrhage under his head , as well as multiple healed rib fractures , ' @entity57 said			0
' he took a tumble at some point			0
' the author of a recently published profile of the troubled artist on the @entity98 website suggests that these injuries were caused by drunken tumbles he would take after drinking too much			1
famous : @entity2 and tennis ace @entity102 ( center ) attend an event during the ' @entity106 ' recording session at @entity107 @entity2 's commercial successes did not endear him with the art establishment , who criticized him for appearing to appeal to the widest possible audience , his brother once told the @entity113			1
the attacks on his work and the artist 's split with his wife two years ago took a toll , and he turned to alcohol over the past four or five years , @entity114 said			1
' as much as he said it did n't bother him , in his heart deep down inside it would sadden him that people would criticize , so hatefully , his work and his vision , when people did n't understand him , ' said @entity114 , an associate professor of criminal justice at @entity130			0
in a 2006 @entity133 article detailing accusations made in court filings about @entity2 's treatment of employees and gallery owners , it says the artist had made several drunken scenes , including one at a @entity143 and @entity144 show , where he continuously shouted slurs at the entertainers			1
estranged : @entity2 did his best to hide his drinking from his wife of 30 years , @entity148 ( pictured ) in another case , he fell off of a bar stool and then grabbed a woman 's breast			2
in yet another , @entity2 is said to have urinated on a @entity155 figure outside of a @entity156 in @entity157 as part of what former employees say he called ' ritual territory marking			1
' while urinating on the @entity155 figure , @entity2 reportedly yelled ' this one 's for you , @entity165 , ' in reference to @entity168 founder @entity165			1
following his death , @entity2 's widow and girlfriend battled in the courts over the painter 's estate , with girlfriend @entity54 releasing handwritten notes allegedly written by @entity2 that are barely legible and presumably written while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol			1
in one of the scrawls , @entity2 allegedly writes , ' " i , @entity2 , being of sound mind and body do hereby bequeath to @entity54 $ 10,000,000 in cash from my corporate policy and i give her the house at 16324 and 16342 @entity185 for her security			2
' mistress : @entity2 's mistress of 18 months , @entity54 ( pictured ) , fought with @entity148 for control of his estate following his death evidence : @entity2 's mistress claimed this barely legible note says @entity2 wanted to leave her $ 10 million and his @entity56 mansion the artist appears to have written these notes while under the influence of drugs or alcohol - if he wrote them at all in an equally barely legible document released by @entity54 , @entity2 allegedly wrote ' i , @entity2 , hereby bequeath my house at 16324 @entity185 , @entity56 , @entity205 to @entity54 in the event of my death			1
i also give the sum of $ 10,000,000 to @entity54 to be used for the establishment of the @entity210 at 16324 @entity185 , @entity205 for the public display in perpetuity of original art. this statement is null and void if my relationship with ms. @entity54 ends as it is defined by me in a future letter			0
' @entity148 and @entity54 reached a private settlement out of court over the artist 's estate			2
' my brother was a good man , ' @entity114 tells the @entity98			0
' the tragedy of my brother is he eventually fell to his own humanity			0
the triumph of my brother is that his art was never touched by that tragedy			0
his art was affirmation that there was hope , there was beauty , and a statement of love that was n't touched by this			0

@entity2 's 2012 death was caused by an accidental overdose from ethanol and @entity21 intoxication
the troubled artist had a *history* of alcohol abuse and in many cases made drunken scenes
in one instance , @entity2 urinated on a @entity168 character while yelling ' this one 's for you , @entity165 '
former employees say the @entity168 *incident* was the beginning of what @entity2 called ' ritual territorial urination '
