@entity18 , 18 , @entity19 , 18 , @entity20 , 19 , and 16 - year - old @entity21 were yesterday found guilty of his murder			2
jailed : ( clockwise from top left ) @entity18 , 18 , @entity19 , 18 , @entity20 , 19 , and @entity21 , 16 stabbed a 15 year - old schoolboy to death in the street during a ' postcode war ' judge @entity29 told them the ' ghastly ' killing was ' cowardly beyond belief '			1
@entity10 was said to have been a victim of a postcode rivalry between two teenage gangs which saw three stabbings in a week in neighbouring areas of north @entity17			1
the first two victims , involving rivals from the @entity38 and @entity43 's @entity42 group , survived			2
@entity10 , 15 , was the victim of a ' postcode ' gang war but @entity10 , a member of @entity42 , died from his injuries following the attack by members of the @entity49 on april 10 , 2011			1
the court heard that after the murder @entity20 wrote a series of vile rap lyrics glorifying knife attacks which judge @entity29 described as a ' hymn to knife violence			1
' they included the chilling line : ' stab a man up and then ask who 's next			2
' @entity62 , @entity63 , prosecuting , said : ' a group of seven boys from the @entity49 gang rode out of @entity67 on bicycles , like a hunting posse , south into @entity70 , in order to carry out that attack			2
' @entity10 was riding his bike with some other lads when he was spotted , chased and killed			1
mr @entity62 added : ' @entity10 came off his bike and he was attacked			1
he was knocked to the ground and repeatedly stabbed in the chest and in his legs			2
' a metal knife that was used to stab him was driven down into him with such force that the blade snapped off the handle			1
' @entity10 was left lying on the pavement , blood pouring from his wounds			1
he lost a lot of blood very quickly and died that evening in hospital			0
' @entity10 's mother @entity88 said in a statement to the court : " my heart is broken			1
@entity10 died just before his 16th birthday			1
he did not get to finish school			0
there was no prom for him			0
i was picking out his coffin on his birthday			0
' of her son 's killers , she said : ' i am angry and hate what they have done			0
it seems these young boys have no respect for life , even their own			0
one day , if they become parents they will think about @entity10 and the pain they have caused			2
' scene : @entity10 died in daylight in a street of smartly restored @entity117 terrace houses the judge lifted a court order banning the identification of the 16 year - old as @entity21 , from @entity122 , @entity67 , and the 17 year - old girl @entity124 , who gave @entity19 a false alibi			1
@entity21 , who was only 14 at the time of the murder , came to the @entity128 because of his family 's problems with gang violence in @entity132 , the court heard			0
@entity49 all day brudda that 's the set , when you come thru my hood better show some respect , or my little @entity139 will push a blade thru your neck stab a man up and then ask who 's next			2
when i ride out no gun just my samuri , i 'll chop him his head until he f * * * * * * dies they stabbed me up once but they ca n't stab me f * * * * * * twice @entity149 stab him in the back and leave him f * * * * * * paralised			2
' all four were sentenced to detention at @entity152			0
@entity19 will serve at least 19 years before parole , @entity18 16 and a half years , @entity20 17 years and @entity154 and a half years			0
@entity155 was sentenced to 12 months detention and training order			0
judge @entity29 said : ' it seems to occur to none of the perpetrators that an attack by seven or eight armed and masked on one is cowardly beyond belief			1
' you feel able to operate in some sort of parallel universe in which robbery , theft , drugs and violence are acceptable , unless a member of you gang is the victim , in which case retaliation is necessary to preserve status and what is laughably called respect			0
' this is all because of loyalty to a postcode			0
it simply creates a vicious circle of anger , misery and death			0
lack of moral values lie at the heart of it and the picture painted before the jury over the last six weeks has been infinitely depressing			0
' @entity18 and @entity19 , both of @entity67 , north @entity17 , @entity20 , of @entity194 , @entity195 , and @entity21 , of @entity67 , shouted as they left the dock to begin their sentence .			0
