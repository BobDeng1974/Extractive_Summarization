by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 is planning to issue a dramatic update to its phone software , one that wo n't be available to current @entity6 , in an effort to gain a foothold against the omnipresent @entity10 and @entity11 models			1
the new software , @entity12 , will be available on new phones this fall , @entity2 said wednesday at a presentation in @entity15			1
the software will bring @entity18 phones closer to pcs and tablets running the company 's upcoming @entity18 8 , which is also scheduled to launch later this year			1
but the company is playing catch - up in an arena dominated by @entity38 and @entity39			0
@entity2 launched @entity40 in 2010 , making a clean break with its previous phone software , which had become outdated			1
@entity43 , until recently the world 's biggest maker of phones , has pledged to use it for all its smartphones , and launched its first @entity12 in the @entity48 earlier this year			1
sales have been anaemic , however			0
@entity50 estimated that 2.2 per cent of the smartphones shipped worldwide in the first quarter of this year ran @entity2 's software , compared to 23 per cent for @entity38 and 59 per cent for @entity11			1
making a point : @entity55 , @entity43 's senior vice president , also spoke at the event still , @entity48 wireless carriers support @entity12 , seeing it as a valuable counterweight to the clout of @entity38 's @entity10 and phones running @entity39 's @entity11 software			1
the new @entity12 will attempt to compete with the likes of the ever - popular @entity10 and @entity11 with features including a turn - by - turn navigational system , a newer , faster browser , and tiles that can be custom - fit to the screen			1
but , as @entity69 notes , the most ostensibly important feature is what ’s under the hood – the @entity18 operating system			1
because the phone will share a similar platform as any @entity18 pc , games , software , and web browsers can run on phones , a feat that is not currently achievable with other smart phones			2
it also offers ‘ wallet ’ technology , allowing safe use for storing credit and banking data as well as other sensitive personal information			0
@entity12 is making progress in one respect			2
hit games ' @entity91 ' and ' @entity93 ' will be among the apps available for @entity95			0
there are 100,000 applications available for @entity18 phones today , @entity2 said			1
that 's far less than the number of apps available for iphones and @entity11 phones			0
@entity12 will accept expansion memory cards , like @entity11 phones do			2
it will also work on processors with more than one computing ' core , ' which is common in high - end smartphones			0
more cores boost computing power and can cut power consumption			0
the new software will also work with near - field communications chips , allowing phones to be used in place of credit cards at some payment terminals			0
at the conference , @entity2 's head of phone software , @entity23 , demonstrated how @entity122 can be used to link two phones so their owners can play a @entity126 - like game			1
tapping the phones together can engage @entity122 , and prompt the devices to establish a link over @entity130			0
some recent @entity11 phones come with @entity122 capabilities , but they 're missing from the @entity10			0
@entity12 will share the operating system ' kernel , ' or most basic functions , with @entity136 , which will run on tablets and computers			2
that means manufacturers will have an easier time making hardware that can use either system			0
developers will have an easier time moving applications from one platform to the other , @entity2 said			2
changing its phone software at such a basic level means that it will be difficult to install on existing @entity18 phones .			0

@entity2 *announced* that @entity12 to be launched this fall at press conference in @entity15
among features is new @entity18 , ' wallet ' feature , custom tiles , and step - by - step navigation
