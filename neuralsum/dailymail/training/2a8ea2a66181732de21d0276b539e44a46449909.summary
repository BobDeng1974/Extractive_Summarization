@entity1 @entity2 governor @entity1 's re-election campaign risked a @entity4 image last week with a @entity6 promotion asking parents to make campaign contributions instead of buying their children @entity10 presents			1
' instead of electronics or toys that will undoubtedly be outdated , broken , or lost by the next @entity14 , ' a @entity1 re-election campaign email instructed , ' help give your children the gift of a @entity2 that we can all be proud of			1
' it was ' a @entity6 special that is better than any deal found in stores , ' the campaign claimed : ' donate $ 5 , $ 10 or $ 25 to help governor @entity1 get reelected and save your children from a future of double - digit tax increases and billion dollar budget deficits			2
' @entity1 is riding a wave of popularity in his home state that has political wags speculating about a presidential run in 2016			2
@entity2 governor @entity1 's re-election campaign asked moms and dads to raid their children 's @entity10 gift funds for political contributions @entity1 's deputy campaign finance director claimed @entity2 children would be better off with a @entity41 governor than with ' electronics or toys ' on @entity10 @entity44 , who has served as the campaign 's deputy finance director since july , signed the email			1
she did not respond to requests for comment			0
the liberal blog @entity51 first published the fundraising solicitation			0
it compared the effort to news reports about a @entity56 , @entity58 @entity57 that asked its employees for food donations to benefit their lower - income coworkers , and a union - driven publicity stunt that advised low - wage @entity64 's employees to return their @entity10 gifts and pay off their debts instead			0
but another political campaign pioneered the tactic last year			2
@entity69 , the president 's re-election campaign , introduced its @entity72 in june 2012			1
the organization asked @entity75 voters to ' register with @entity69 2012 , and ask for a donation in lieu of a gift ' for their birthdays , bar or bat mitzvahs , weddings and anniversaries			1
' instead of another gift card you ’ll forget to use , ' the campaign wrote on @entity69 's trailblazing e-commerce website , ' ask your friends and family for something that will go a little further : a donation to @entity69 for @entity93			1
' @entity94 : the president 's 2012 re-election campaign asked supporters to decline birthday , wedding and anniversary gifts , and send @entity101 the proceeds instead spoof : conservatives mocked the @entity69 team in 2012 by circulating a fake campaign announcement asking @entity69 voters to opt for cremation instead of burial when they die ? and send the savings to the president 's campaign not real : @entity115 forces responded in 2012 with a plea for expectant parents to name their kids ' @entity101 ' or ' @entity119 ' -- and make a symbolic donation , in the tyke 's name , of course @entity69 's campaign organization was renamed ' @entity125 ' in 2013 , and still hosts the fundraising stunt on its website			1
the urban legend - debunking website @entity129 confirmed in july 2012 that the @entity69 effort was the real thing			1
conservatives were quick to mock it at the time , spoofing the @entity72 with a series of parodies that quickly went viral			0
one , an @entity137 , appeared to ask @entity69 supporters to opt for cremation instead of a more expensive burial or their dearly departed loved ones – and send the savings to the @entity69 campaign			0
' your loved ones will thank you – from the grave , ' the comedic piece joked			0
another conservative skewering was a fictitious @entity151 registry , asking expectant parents to name their new children ' @entity101 ' or ' @entity119 , ' mark the occasion with a $ 100 donation to the president 's campaign , and enter a drawing for $ 1,000			1
' your decision to terminate a pregnancy before the election does not affect your odds of winning the grand prize , ' snarked the lampoon 's authors			0
the fundraising email was signed by campaign deputy finance director @entity44 ( @entity166 )			2
@entity1 hopes to beat back a challenge from @entity169 @entity168 ( r ) , a former mountain bike company executive gov. @entity1 's most likely @entity75 opponent in 2014 has attracted her own share of scorn			1
former trek bicycle company executive @entity168 got a @entity175 black eye in november when the @entity93 @entity176 ruled that as many as 20 former @entity178 employees were eligible for federal aid because the company eliminated their jobs by outsourcing more of its work to @entity183			0
@entity1 swept into power , and survived a union - bankrolled recall effort , on the strength of labor policies that @entity75 opposed bitterly			0
the state 's @entity41 has come down on the side of businesses that choose to outsource jobs to save money			0
the governor has made some pundits ' short - lists of potential @entity41 presidential candidates , claiming during a book tour that the @entity199 's next occupant should be a governor , not a member of @entity201			2
. ' it ’s got to be somebody who ’s viewed as being exceptionally removed from @entity204 , ' he told @entity205 , adding that ' i do n’t rule anything out ' when it comes to his future political aspirations .			0

@entity1 campaign fundraising email said his re-election would be a better gift to children than toys or electronic *gadgets*
president @entity69 's 2012 campaign pioneered the idea of a political donation ' gift registry ' for birthdays , weddings and anniversaries
conservatives spoofed the @entity69 effort at the time with fictitious registries based on funeral cremations and baby naming
@entity1 is thought of as a likely @entity41 presidential candidate in 2016
his opponent has her own ethical cloud *related* to labor practices when she was a mountain bike company executive
