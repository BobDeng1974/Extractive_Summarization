spiders - more of them and bigger than before - are coming to your home			0
new research from the @entity4 suggests more spiders now prefer urban environments to their natural habitats			1
her findings suggest spiders are increasingly opting for domestic locales			0
' over 4500 spiders from 160 species were collected and identified			0
there were just as many spiders in @entity30 backyards as in bushland , and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in @entity37 , ' ms @entity9 said			2
ms @entity9 's research also indicates spiders in urban areas are growing larger and breeding more than in the past another recent study by @entity42 suggested spiders are opting for the more affluent suburbs , where they are larger and more fertile than elsewhere			1
in a seperate study , @entity42 found that urban spiders are also growing larger and breeding more than in the past			0
thankfully , more dangerous breeds of spiders do not appear to be joining the urban migration			0
' the only dangerous species of spiders are redbacks and funnel - web , and we are n't seeing a growth in those species in households , ' ms @entity9 said			1
ms @entity9 is presenting her research at the @entity63 of @entity64 conference in @entity65			1
' i am interested in the wildlife in cities because maintaining biodiversity in urban areas is essential for both the conservation of native species and the wellbeing of people living there , ' she said			2
@entity42 says there were just as many spiders in @entity30 backyards as in bush land , and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in @entity37 the white - tailed spider , native to southern and eastern @entity64 , is one of the species @entity42 examined in her study			2

research by @entity91 phd student @entity9 shows several spider species new prefer urban environments to the wild
spiders in urban areas are bigger and more *sexually* *active* than their country *cousins* , her research shows
spiders in the most affluent suburbs are the *healthiest* of all
thankfully , the most dangerous species such as redbacks and funnel - webs are still seem to prefer rural environments over the suburbs
the *results* of ms @entity9 's research will be presented to an @entity63 of @entity64 conference this week
