@entity0 introduced guidelines forcing schools to promote @entity4 values @entity6 inspectors asked ten year olds at a @entity9 school if they knew what lesbians ' did ' to check they were being taught about @entity4 values , it has been claimed			1
@entity12 has made a formal complaint over an ' intrusive ' inspection conducted in the wake of the @entity17 controversy over @entity19 attempts to infiltrate schools			1
inspectors are also said to have questioned pupils about transsexuality and asked if any of their friends felt trapped in the ' wrong body '			2
the school is among a growing number to complain they have been unfairly penalised by rules designed to combat extremism			0
there are claims that some schools – mainly those with a religious ethos or located in rural areas with few ethnic minority pupils – have been put under undue pressure by a new requirement to promote @entity4 values			1
@entity38 , which teaches pupils aged four to 18 , has a @entity9 ethos but no faith - based selection criteria , resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions			0
principal @entity46 was a supporter of the @entity4 values initiative when details were published last year but inspectors ' unannounced visit to the school last november led him to complain to @entity6 that the ' tenor of the inspection was negative and hostile '			1
it was ' as if the data collected had to fit a pre-determined outcome ' , he said , and many of the questions ' seem to betray an underlying disrespect for the @entity9 faith '			0
pupils were asked whether anyone in their school had two mums or dads			2
when the inspectors were giving feedback to staff on their findings , ' it was suggested that a response from one child to the effect of querying how it is possible to have two mums was viewed as indicating a lack of awareness of lesbian relationships ' , the complaint letter said			0
@entity12 has formally complained about @entity6 inspectors whose questioning of pupils ' crossed the line ' ' i understand the child concerned was merely thinking in biological terms			0
in addition , i have also heard reports of primary schoolchildren being asked if they knew of any boys or girls who thought they were in the ' wrong body '			2
the so - called @entity17 plot was an alleged attempt to introduce a hardline @entity19 ethos into six @entity95 schools			2
it was revealed in a letter leaked in march last year , alleged to be from islamists detailing how to wrest control of a school and speculating about using the scheme in other cities			0
it included claims that male and female pupils were segregated , non-muslim staff were driven out and a strict religious agenda was imposed			0
a three - month @entity6 inquiry , which reported in june last year , found the schools did not do enough to protect children from extremism			1
in the wake of the findings , the @entity112 announced that all schools must promote ' @entity4 values ' of tolerance and fairness and warned that teachers would be banned from the profession if they allowed extremists into schools			1
proposals would also allow @entity6 to visit any school without warning , saying the schools in the plot had previously been able to stage a ' cover - up '			1
' another parent has complained to me that her ten - year - old daughter was asked if she knew what lesbians ' did '			1
' they also allegedly questioned children as young as six about their knowledge of @entity138 festivals and the @entity140 @entity139			1
he suggested that the questioning of pupils ' crossed the line into harassment '			0
sixth - formers at the school have also prepared written complaints , claiming that inspectors appeared to be ' manipulating ' the conversation during group discussions about racism and homophobia , seemingly determined to ' discredit ' the school			0
the guidelines , introduced by the education secretary @entity0 last year , require schools actively to promote ' @entity4 values ' including democracy , liberty and tolerance			1
' other institutions said to have unfairly fallen foul of the rules include a @entity9 school in @entity164 , @entity165 , that says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies			0
in another case , a high - performing primary school in @entity171 , @entity172 , was marked down because pupils lacked ' first - hand experience of the diverse make - up of modern @entity4 society '			1
inspectors made no allowance for the fact that 97 per cent of the population of the town is white			0
an @entity6 spokesman said it would be ' considering the issues raised by the school ' and added : ' @entity6 does not require evidence that schools ' promote ' other faiths			2
instead , inspectors must ensure that pupils are able to express views which are neither intolerant nor discriminatory towards others			0
