the derelict military bunker at the centre of a @entity4 officer 's botched plot to blow up @entity5 will be opened to the public as a museum			1
the @entity8 , located in the @entity10 woods in northeastern @entity11 , has been open to the public since the end of @entity14 , but mainly for much criticised paintball games or as an indoor shooting range			1
it was one of @entity5 ’s key military headquarters during the war			1
but is most famous as the place @entity21 tried to kill the dictator by placing a briefcase bomb underneath the table during a staff meeting on july 20 , 1944			1
new image : tourists wander around the remains of the @entity8 in @entity11 , which will now open as a museum to educate visitors about its history the plan was to kill @entity5 and replace him with a government which would negotiate a truce with the @entity35 , ending the war			1
having left the conference for a pre-arranged phone call , colonel @entity21 , whose fate was thrown back into the spotlight due to 2008 movie @entity41 starring @entity42 , left the hut shortly before the bomb detonated			2
however , a staff officer had moved the briefcase shortly after @entity21 ’s departure which saw @entity5 protected from the blast and the dictator survived with minor injuries			2
@entity51 was captured and executed alongside three conspirators and all their relatives were sent to concentration camps			2
a total of 200 were executed as a result of the assassination attempt			2
overgrown : part of one of the derelict bunkers on the 600 acre complex which once had its own train station title : @entity8 , @entity8 in @entity4 , was named after @entity5 's self - appointed nickname : @entity65 four months after the bomb , @entity8 was destroyed by the @entity68 forces as the @entity69 advanced in 1945			2
soon after it became a tourist attraction			0
nearly 70 years later , due to lax legislation , tours of the overgrown bunkers have been less informative than the @entity11 government see fit and tourists can even pose for photographs in @entity68 uniforms			1
‘ at this moment , one does not feel the tragic dimension of this place , ’ historian @entity79 told @entity80			0
@entity8 meeting : @entity5 and @entity85 fascist leader @entity84 , far left , in the @entity8 listening to general @entity86 , chief of staff of @entity87 after the bomb : the aftermath of the assassination attempt at @entity8			0
@entity91 , pictured in a light uniform , inspects the wrecked room inside the lair : @entity5 inside the @entity8 shortly after surviving @entity96 's attempt on his life he is involved in the development of @entity8 and underlines the importance of not forgetting its past			0
he said : ' we need to work on new ways of telling history to make young generations want to learn it and understand it			0
' the current lease of the premises is held by @entity109 , who have had the contract since the collapse of @entity11 ’s communist regime			1
hiding place : one of the 80 buildings at the complex , which was built to protect @entity5 from the @entity117 during @entity118 in 1941 critics have called their tours of @entity8 a ' grotesque @entity122 ’ operation and have called for them to stop			1
in a bid to profit from ‘ @entity68 tourism ’ , @entity109 , a private company , built a restaurant , a hotel and even an indoor shooting range located in the offices of general @entity86 , a @entity129 commander sentenced to death at @entity131			1
but due to the remote location , @entity109 have not had much success in luring tourists to the bunker and the 600 - acre complex is in despair with overgrown buildings and pathways			0
in an effort to re-build the bunker , @entity109 have agreed to work with historians , according to @entity143			0
two visitors at the @entity8 scan a map of the area with explanations of the purposes for each building tour guide : the site plan reveals there were two casinos , a cinema , a sauna and two tea rooms @entity11 ’s @entity157 and national heritage gave strict instructions to the company that no new lease would be granted unless the company meet educational requirements			1
the hideout - whose name references @entity5 's nickname , ' @entity65 ' - consisted of 80 buildings at its peak including its own power plant and a railway station			0
the complex , built in 1940 , was heavily camouflaged and surrounded by a minefield , which took ten years to clear after the war			0
immortalized : the attempt to assassinate @entity5 was brought to life in the @entity178 ' never forget : a commemorative plaque in @entity4 and @entity11 reads ' in memory of the resistance against @entity182 '			0

critics have *previously* called for an end to ' grotesque @entity122 ' tours
