by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 , who helps to manage the office of @entity5 mp @entity4 , is paid through a private company - an arrangement used to avoid tax @entity5 is under fire for employing a senior adviser on an ‘ off payroll ’ arrangement which is often used to avoid tax			1
@entity2 , who manages the office of shadow health secretary @entity4 , is not on a typical staff contract but is paid through his own private company			1
these sorts of deals have been criticised by @entity5 , because they allow both the employee and the employer to get out of paying national insurance contributions			2
if mr @entity2 - who worked at @entity22 in the 1990s – was paying himself out of company dividends , he could also avoid income tax and just pay @entity26 at a lower rate			1
these arrangements are legal but @entity29 , a @entity5 grandee and chair of the @entity31 , has lambasted the widespread use of them at the @entity34 and in @entity35			1
she said two years ago : ‘ if you work in the public service , its beholden on you to lead by example			0
hardworking families up and down the country are paying lots of money in tax and its wrong that individuals working in the public service whose money comes from the tax those families pay are n’t paying their due share			0
‘ i do think that it ’s an issue which somehow people got away with in better times , but now in the austerity era its obviously hugely important that every penny due is collected			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman said they ‘ do not comment on staffing matters ’			2
mr @entity2 , through the party , denied the pay arrangement for the last two years was for financial gain			2
one other – unidentified - political adviser , to a different mp , is understood to have similar arrangements			0
both mr @entity2 and the other adviser and are being moved onto staff contracts this year			2
mr @entity2 , 50 , is a former @entity5 staffer who ran mr @entity4 ’s failed leadership bid , and loaned money to it , in 2010			1
he was hired to head mr @entity4 ’s office in october 2011 , for two - and - a - half days a week , paid for by the @entity5			1
the arrangement is legal but has previously been lambasted by @entity29 , chairwoman of the @entity31 and @entity5 grandee the rest of the week he worked for @entity73 mp , and was paid for that by @entity75 which regulates mp ’s expenses			1
party sources said his off - payroll status dates back to when he worked for both mps , and it is an anomaly which was not rectified when he went full - time with mr @entity4 in summer 2012			2
when he was appointed , mr @entity2 ’s job with @entity4 was attacked as a ‘ huge conflict of interest ’ because his @entity84 firm – @entity85 and public affairs – had several @entity88 trusts as clients			1
his @entity91 page boasts of his ‘ political acumen , excellent public affairs knowledge , and significant experience and understanding of stakeholder engagement with politicians			0
’ a @entity99 source said : ‘ @entity5 want to put up @entity100 and hit families and businesses across the country – so it ’s pretty galling that they do n’t want to pay it for their own employees			0
‘ this is yet another classic case of @entity5 saying one thing and doing another			0
’ @entity110 head of financial planning at @entity112 explained : ‘ charging fees through a service company is far more tax efficient than being self - employed			0
‘ this is primarily because the employee pays some or all of their own salary in dividends – which are subject to a lower rate of income tax and no employee or employer national insurance			0
