small but perfectly formed : the tiny house has been converted from a garage and is just 13ft wide size is n't everything : the ground floor features a combined sitting / kitchen and dining room not a good size : the top floor is big enough to fit a double bed but not suitable for the tall homeowner estate agent @entity26 of @entity27 said there has already been considerable interest in the home			1
he said the two - storey house , converted from a garage , is one of the most unusual they have seen			1
despite its diminutive nature , the home has a sitting / dining / kitchen room , a rear hall and bathroom on the ground floor and a double bedroom on the first floor			1
it even boasts its own courtyard at the back			1

' although the price may seem high for such a small property , it represents a real bargain when compared to the cost of other properties in the area			0
it is in the @entity72 district , where the average price of a flat is £ 96,730 or £ 279,612 for a detached house			2
the property is currently occupied by a tenant , on an assured short hold tenancy agreement , paying it is understood , £ 400.00 per calendar month			0

the estate agents said the unusual house is a perfect first - time buy			1
