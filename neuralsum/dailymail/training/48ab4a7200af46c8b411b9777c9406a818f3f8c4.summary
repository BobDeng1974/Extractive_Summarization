it was billed as ' the most amazing @entity1 experience that @entity5 has ever seen ' , complete with a baby reindeer hut , hundreds of @entity1 trees and a festive express train to take children to visit @entity8			1
but a festive winter wonderland created by interior designer @entity11 has shut after just one day after dozens of children were left in tears because of rude staff , @entity9 stood around smoking and broken rides			1
parents said the @entity18 at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , has ruined the build up to @entity1 for their children , as they attacked the ' tacky ' attraction which costs up to £ 22.50 for a ticket			1
' but unhappy families have demanded their money back after bombarding the company with complaints			1
parents complained about rude staff , large queues for their children to visit @entity1 and said cheap unwrapped presents , some squashed or broken , were being handed out to their children			1
others complained of a lack of festive decorations and @entity1 music , despite paying more than £ 20 a ticket for their children			1
@entity50 wrote on @entity51 : ' i want my £ 22 refunded			0
' you did not deliver what you advertised and have ripped people off that is the issue and some of your staff are damn right rude and clearly do not care			0
' @entity60 experience what a joke and it did n't even last the allocated time of 80/90 minutes either			1
' @entity69 added : ' never mind the ' rain ' , the rude & unhelpful staff , unsafe train , rubbish cheap present that 's given unwrapped , workmen sat around smoking , empty tepees , rooms not being soundproofed , no music or festive decorations , waiting around in a succession of empty rooms , and lack of a baby reindeer are frankly enough for me to digest ! ! ' @entity77 said : ' ruining the magic of @entity1 for little kids ! ' ripping off parents right on top of @entity1 when they could 've spent that money on @entity1 presents ! well done ! ! i hope @entity11 whatever his name is , and @entity85 , are proud ! ! ' parents reported that the winter express train , to @entity8 's grotto , broke down during the first day it was open organisers said the @entity18 would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations the @entity18 remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations mr @entity96 unveiled the winter wonderland last week and had promised it would be a unique festive experience for families			1
he said a visit to @entity1 would ' never be the same again ' and that the experience was ' going to be perfect			1
' tickets were sold up for the weekend and seven days in the run - up to @entity1 and organisers had been working through the night last week to get the attraction ready for the launch day after preparations were hampered by heavy rain			1
however many have criticised both @entity96 and organisers behind @entity18 for false advertising and poor health and safety			1
mother - of - three @entity115 , 46 , was one of the first to visit the attraction at 10am on saturday			1
she paid £ 140 for tickets and travelling up from @entity118 , a three hour round trip , with her three children @entity122 , five , @entity121 , 13 , and @entity123 , 15			1
the teaching assistant said she knew straight away the visit was going to be a ' nightmare ' after spotting elves hanging around outside smoking and complaining about their shifts			1
she said the @entity1 illusion was then completely shattered when they saw a ' very skinny @entity8			1
' she said : ' you could see right through to the back where there was boxes of fake snow and diggers and elves standing around having a fag			0
' it shatters the magic somewhat straight away when you see elves standing around smoking and moaning that they were working until 9pm			1
' my 15 - year - old son just looked at me to say ' where on earth have you brought me to ? ' as you went in there was a few @entity1 trees but without any decorations or lights or music - it was depressing			1
' then we walked through a door that looked like any old arena or hall			0
there was no @entity1 feel to it whatsoever , the stalls were poor and the museum was appalling			2
' they had a few antlers , a sledge and then a babygrow with fur around which was supposed to be @entity8 's when he was a baby			2
' our @entity8 was ok but there was this really skinny @entity8 there too , which people were n't too happy about at all			2
especially when the presents were n't even wrapped			0
' we went because we respect and like @entity11 and his personality but we were bitterly disappointed			2
' it just did n't seem finished , it will take more than three days to get that all sorted , that 's for sure			0
' @entity179 said : ' i visited the magical journey today at 10.30am the whole experience was a joke , budget is not the word to explain this place			0
' while we tock ( sic ) the 15 second train journey the train hit a tractor parked in the car park then one of the trees if they would of hit the tractor any harder the train would of turned over the train was being driven wrecklessly and too fast for the conditions			0
parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children 's @entity1 mr @entity96 opened the experience last week and said the festive attraction was going to be ' perfect ' the festive experience was billed as ' the most amazing ' @entity1 attraction ever seen before it opened ' i will be contacting health and safety to report this first thing monday morning , the main tent construction had screws and sharp objects sticking out , there has been no thought of safety at this event at all			1

speaking at the launch , mr @entity96 said : ' it is a brave thing to be doing this sort of thing completely outside			0
normally it is in an industrial unit so these things can be completely controlled			0
' there is no magic in that			0
yes , we have had some teething troubles			0
but by saturday it is going to be absolutely perfect			0
' we set ourselves a very high bar			0
