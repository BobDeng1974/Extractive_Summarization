by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 5 july 2013 @entity1 is known for its murky skies and greying buildings , but something else up there is turning a little off - white , too ...			1
the city has been outed as capital with the most greying underwear , with women admitting that 12 pairs of their 18 white knickers have seen brighter days			1
meanwhile , down in @entity16 , women are better at keeping their undies sparkling ( or better at lying ) , with girls in the capital saying only three of their average 18 pairs are n't as crisp and white as they once were			1
@entity1 vs @entity16 : the @entity23 divide comes into play in the white - off the nationwide study of 1,500 women revealed that the average adult female in the @entity29 owns 18 items of white underwear , with many of these beginning to look grey over time , due primarily to being washed incorrectly or simply being old			1
and it appears there 's a clear north - south divide when it comes to white underwear having passed its heyday			2
in @entity42 just 18 per cent of ladies ' white undies are greyed out			1
but up in @entity43 , from a collection of 18 items of white underwear , 59 per cent are not whiter than white			1
@entity48 , in the heart of the midlands , is closer to the south in its grey underwear count - with ladies owning a white underwear collection that has just 29 per cent greyed content			2
@entity54 or grey ? whites go grey if washed at the wrong temperature and with other , non-white , clothing items maybe the statistics can be explained by how much the owners of the smalls wash their underwear - @entity64 women are the most fervent when it comes to washing their smalls , clocking up an average of three loads per week			1
@entity69 , however , are not quite so committed in the laundry room , with ladies living in the capital opting for just a single underwear wash per week			2
@entity74 , spokesman for dr @entity75 who carried out the research , said : ' women in @entity1 have the greyest white underwear in the @entity29			1
but it seems it is mainly due to the fact that they are the most evangelistic about washing their smalls			2
' unfortunately , they are almost certainly washing them at the wrong temperature , too often and possibly with other , non-white , clothing items which are affecting the brightness of their whites over time			1
' they should maybe consider using a whitening product in their wash from time to time to correct the adverse effects of the washing cycle on their smalls			0

women in @entity29 own 18 pairs of white underpants , on average
those in @entity1 say more than 12 pairs are greying
@entity69 say only three of their pairs are past their best
washing at wrong temperature or too often and with dark *colours* to blame
