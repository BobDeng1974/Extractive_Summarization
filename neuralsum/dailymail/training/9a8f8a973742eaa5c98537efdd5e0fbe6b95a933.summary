@entity61 , left , and @entity62 , right @entity63 ( £ 18 for 150ml at @entity64 ) it 's easy for winter complexions to become clogged , dull and spotty , thanks to the build - up of dry skin cells and the hot - and - cold conditions			1
so exfoliating is a must , and this scrub is one of my favourites			0
it 's gentle enough to use on your face , but you can use it all over , too , to soften dry areas like elbows , knees - anywhere that gets overlooked in winter			1
and if you 're planning a fake tan spray , exfoliating first is especially important to ensure an even @entity87 ( £ 12 for 75ml at @entity64 ) this hair mask is a life - saver for hair that 's over-coloured or over-bleached , or that 's looking tired and dry thanks to too much heat - styling , which is a common problem at the end of party season			2
simply massage it into your hair before you shampoo , and leave in for a while to let it work it 's magic			2
then wash as normal and you 'll be thrilled at how sleek , healthy and shiny your hair feels			0
@entity102 @entity103 nourishing cream @entity105 ( £ 21.59 for 50ml at escentual.com ) a super-rich moisturiser is a winter must - have and this one really does the trick , reviving parched skin			2
i use it morning and night after cleansing and adore how baby - soft it makes my face @entity116 ( £ 33.59 for 30ml at @entity64 ) i just love the look of this primer - a bottle of gorgeous glistening pearls ! blend it onto clean , moisturised skin , and the lightweight nude - coloured base will even out your skin tone and create a flattering and flawless canvas for the rest of your make - up			0
@entity129 , left , and @entity130 @entity131 ( £ 5.99 at @entity132 ) i 've been using this self tan since school and i really love it			0
i use the medium matte but it also comes in dark and light to suit different skin types			0
it has a lovely sweet nutty scent which i adore			0
it covers very easily and gives a nice tan and you can keep building it up as you wish			0
i start with a small amount as it takes about a minute to rub in properly and then i can add more			0
it applies streak free it takes some practice but if you have used fake tan before it should n't be a problem			0
it is a wash off one so you can apply whenever you desire and do n't have to worry about being patchy and it works equally well on face or body			0
