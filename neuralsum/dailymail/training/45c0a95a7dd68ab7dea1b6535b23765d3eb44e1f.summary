@entity0 have certainly signed a talented defender with the arrival of @entity4 right - back @entity3 to the @entity5 in a £ 12million deal but are his singing skills up to scratch ? the highly - regarded defender faced his new team mates with a rendition of the indie classic ‘ @entity13 ’ from the @entity14 which came out when @entity12 was just 11 - years - old in 2006			1
@entity12 only made 23 first team appearances for @entity4 but @entity16 has seen enough to recognise his potential			2
@entity29 understands that manager @entity16 plans to convert @entity12 in to a centre back in the long term			2
he has signed for an initial £ 12m - the same price @entity0 paid for @entity26 - but his fee could eventually rise to £ 16m in add - ons			1
@entity35 : new team mate @entity26 is thrilled by the new arrival at @entity0 big future : fellow former @entity38 @entity26 tweeted his delight at @entity0 signing @entity12 @entity16 is impressed with the defender 's versatility and it is hoped that in time he could become as influential as former captain @entity43			1

they are a team i have much admired for their playing style , and a team who have been one of the top sides in @entity50 for many years			0

' new gunner : @entity3 will compete with fellow new signing @entity78 at right - back this season settling in : @entity12 was welcomed to @entity0 by goal keeper @entity81 on his @entity83 page the defender is with his new team - mates in @entity86 , with keeper @entity81 posting a welcome picture and message of himself , @entity12 and @entity26 on the team bus			1
