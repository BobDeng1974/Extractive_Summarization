@entity0 is on @entity2 ’s shortlist as the @entity4 giants scout @entity5 for a new manager with current coach @entity7 coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in @entity10 the former @entity12 and @entity13 manager is considered a potential replacement for @entity7 , whose team plays @entity16 today and who is under considerable pressure after a run of poor results which has seen @entity2 sink to ninth in the table			1
but though @entity0 himself has always made it clear the coaching abroad would appeal to him , the current instability at the @entity4 club may deter him should he be offered the job			1
@entity0 is on @entity2 ’s shortlist as the @entity4 @entity10 giants scout @entity5 for a new manager current @entity2 manager @entity7 is coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in @entity10 former owner and president @entity32 resigned from his honourary post on friday , having publicly questioned @entity7			1
new owner @entity37 @entity36 has stuck by the former @entity39 boss until now – but the @entity32 family still own one third of the club and , according to reports in @entity4 , the boardroom split has been caused by their desire to sack @entity7 now			2
@entity46 , the former chief operating officer at @entity12 , is the current chief executive at @entity2 and would provide an obvious point of contact and potential reassurance to @entity0			2
former @entity13 boss @entity0 is currently without a club after being sacked by @entity12 in april 2014 @entity51 had already announced he was moving to @entity2 before @entity0 was sacked by @entity12 last april and so had no direct part in his dismissal			0
moving to @entity10 would be an attractive option to @entity0 , especially to one of @entity5 ’s superclubs			0
though @entity2 are currently playing in the @entity58 and finished fifth last season , there is clearly an expectation of qualifying for @entity62 football , which would allow @entity0 to prove himself again at that level after his disappointment in following sir @entity65 at @entity12			0
however , he is known to regard the stability of a club as a key factor when he does come back to management , meaning @entity2 would have to present a united front to convince him it was the right job .			0

@entity0 could be offered managerial job at struggling @entity2
current coach of the @entity10 club @entity7 is under pressure
the instability at the @entity4 club may deter @entity0 from taking over
