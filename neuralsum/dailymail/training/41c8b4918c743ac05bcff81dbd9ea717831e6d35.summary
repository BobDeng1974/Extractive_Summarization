this may be the @entity1 , but @entity2 was not going to rush for anybody ’s rules			1
her opponent , @entity5 of @entity6 , was in her chair , baking quietly in the piercing midday sun. a sprinkling of spectators grew impatient and started a slow handclap			1
finally , nine minutes late , out strolled the long limbs of miss @entity2			1
she walked over to her chair and promptly sat down			2
determined : @entity2 saw off @entity13 move into the third round at @entity15 on wednesday now , @entity16 is situated between the perimeter wall and the path to the first - aid centre , undeniably on the edge of the club but hardly on another planet			1
so why this delay ? ‘ was i late ? ’ she pondered , before adding philosophically : ‘ what is late ? i mean , i guess she got there early			0
i do n’t know what time she got there			2
’ @entity2 later denied that a change of underwear from coloured to regulation white was the cause , so we can only assume that cool hauteur had something to do with it			1
five times a champion in @entity40 , i ’ll show up when i ’m jolly well ready			2
she even walked off after knocking up			0
but , the intriguing preliminaries observed , it was rip - roaring tennis from the moment @entity2 threw her @entity46 shoulders into the very first point : a big forehand winner			1
@entity5 , just 5ft 1in and a full foot shorter than her opponent , scampered , chased and fought gamely			1
she barely made a mistake			0
sometimes she was stretching up to hit the ball at eye - level , whereas @entity2 collapsed her knees to do so			1
@entity2 , who suffers from the energy - sapping @entity56 ’s syndrome , still struck the ball mighty hard			1
her first serve averaged 118mph ; poor little @entity5 ’s 86mph			1
but @entity5 started strongly , taking a 3 - 0 lead before @entity2 levelled the scores			1
the pendulum swung towards @entity2 at 5 - 3 , but the first set went to a tiebreak			1
that , too , went one way and then the other : @entity5 led 4 - 1 before @entity2 rattled off six straight points			1
@entity5 needed treatment at the end of the first set , returning to the court with a strapped left thigh			1
it did not seem to limit her too much — and she did not blame the injury afterwards — but @entity2 won six consecutive games to win 7 - 6 , 6 - 1			1
too powerful : @entity2 hits a forehand against @entity5 on day three at @entity15 what an athletic specimen @entity2 is at the age of 34			1
do n’t take my word for it ; hear what she thinks			0
‘ wisdom has served me well , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’ve worn my sunscreen so i have n’t aged terribly			0
my knees are very tight , not saggy			0
and the crow ’s feet have been kept at bay			0
so i ’ll give myself an @entity86			0
’ but in truth nobody expects much of the elder @entity2 sister these days			2
she is seeded 30th here , and before had reached the third round only twice in her last nine grand slams			2
her most notable contribution of recent times was to pose naked for @entity95 ’s @entity94			0
yet her durability is magnificent given the @entity56 ’s syndrome , an incurable auto - immune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain — a handicap in the world of high - performance tennis			2
she has fallen asleep at the wheel of her car and is exhausted if she trains too hard			0
a vegan diet and recuperation are her remedies			0
brave : @entity5 fell short despite rallying during the second set against the five - time champion @entity15 day 3 review so is she contemplating drawing a line under her dazzling career ? ‘ well , i do n’t like watching tennis on tv , ’ she said , while wearing not so much earrings as napkin rings			1
‘ i want to be out there			0
i ’m not about the easy life			0
‘ when i leave tennis , i want it to be on my own terms			0
i want to know i rose to every challenge			0
i want to look back with no regrets			2
so far i can do that			0
everyone loses matches they should have won			0
but as long as you walked out there and gave it your all , you can look back with no regrets			2
’ next up is @entity137 , the 2011 champion			2
please rest up @entity2 , but do n’t forget to set your alarm			1
we do n’t want you late again .			0
