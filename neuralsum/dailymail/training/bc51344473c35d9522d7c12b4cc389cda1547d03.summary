an @entity1 couple were lucky to escape injury after their dog triggered a trip wire that was attached to a homemade gun in the woods last week			1
of @entity10 , were hiking in @entity11 last thursday when they noticed two men who ' were acting really hinky '			1
the pair appeared out of nowhere and @entity8 said they looked like ' the back end of a robbery ' , according to @entity18			0
while walking into the main trail , @entity8 and @entity9 noticed a parachute cord on the ground , which they avoided , but their dog @entity25 stepped on			2
however @entity27 was troubled about what happened on their regular walking route and went back to investigate a few days later			0
he discovered the cord was rigged up through the trees to a makeshift gun			0
the weapon was made from a pipe , that was opened one end and closed the other			0
at the closed end was a firing pin , and inside the pipe was a shotgun shell			1
tripping the parachute cord was meant to trigger a beer bottle that would swing down and hit the firing pin , causing the bullet to fire			1
however it must have malfunctioned with the @entity9 's dog stepped on in it			2
' members of the bomb squad told me , '' @entity66 , you had a shotgun shell pointed right at your head - twice '' , ' mr @entity27 told @entity18 after reporting the matter to police			1
@entity27 said the parachute cord was rigged to a three - quarter - inch - diameter pipe - open at one end , closed at the other - attached to a tree scene : the incident occurred in @entity11 , a popular hiking and walking spot in @entity10 , @entity1 police have taken the weapon as evidence			1
authorities said it was rare to see such a device in a public park , as they tend to be more common in rural areas where people are trying to protect something			0
no other such booby traps have been found in the park			0
mr @entity27 believes it was the work of the two men they saw .			2
