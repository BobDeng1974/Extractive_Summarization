after his grandfather passed away when he was just 12 - years - old , @entity2 resigned himself to the fact that his beloved @entity5 medals were gone forever			1
after searching far and wide for two years , the 36 - year - old amazingly found the medals in the @entity8 and drove over 3500 kilometres in four days to be reunited with the family treasures			1
but on his arrival at the @entity11 , mr @entity2 was refused the medals and told that they ' were more important to the museum			1
' medals include an @entity16 , @entity17 , a @entity18 and others @entity2 ( pictured here with his son @entity21 ) drove for four days to find his grandfather 's medals ' i searched for years and really thought they were lost forever , ' mr @entity2 told @entity26			1
' i started by ringing around @entity28 's asking if anyone had heard of flight lieutenant @entity30			2
' mr @entity2 then began a national search and found clues that brought him to @entity11 after two years of searching			1
' after confirming that we had found the medals , we put it to the museum board , ' he said			2
' it took time to get an answer , but museum director @entity39 responded saying that " the medals are more important to us and they 're going to stay here			0
' " the museum instead offered to send mr @entity2 replicas to which he was outraged			2
' i was disgusted about it , ' he said			0
' it 's the sentimentality , if they put replicas in the museum , the public would not know the difference , but i do			0
' after posting the rejection letter he received on @entity50 , mr @entity2 saw the messages of support and decided to start a petition on @entity54			2
' i never for a moment imagined our family would be left begging for his bravery to be respected – yet unbelievably , that 's exactly what @entity61 has done , rejecting our plea for his service medals to be returned , ' the petition reads			2
captain @entity30 was a flight lieutenant in @entity5 and received many distinguished service medals he has received of 15,000 signatures in under 24 hours and is overwhelmed by the public 's support			1
' i ’m humbled and honoured that people are siding with what ’s right , ' he said			0
the medals for mr @entity30 's service included the distinguished @entity16 , an order of the @entity75 , a @entity76 , a @entity18 among various others			1
but mr @entity2 's biggest regret is that his ill mother will not get to see her father 's medals again			1
' she can barely make it to the front door , let alone @entity11 , ' he said			0
' she 'll never see them again if we ca n't get them home			0
' the director of the museum and @entity89 , @entity87 understands that the family are emotionally tied to these items , but said he has respected the intent of the donor			0
the donor was mr @entity30 's wife , @entity96 , who has also since passed away			1
' @entity97 , who is the executrix of the will called us and confirmed that it was very clearly in his will , ' mr @entity87 told @entity26			0
director of @entity104 , @entity87 , said he respected the intent of the donor to have medals benefit the public ' both of them detailed what their intent was and it was to have the medals at the museum benefiting the public			2
' mr @entity87 said that after mrs @entity118 's death , it took a year for the museum to receive an offer of donation as it went through the board for a long period			0
' a note from @entity96 herself says , " let me put these things where they should be because that respects my husband ’s wishes , " ' mr @entity87 said			0
mr @entity2 said he never knew about the will as his family did not have a relationship with mr @entity30 's second wife			1
' i only found out about this last night as it was never mentioned to me , not even my emailing back and forth with the museum , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' i 'm still beside myself why this is coming to light now			0
' mr @entity2 is still hoping for the museum to override the board 's decision			1
' if anything were to ever happen i 'd give them back to them , ' he said			0
' i 'd just love for the museum to have a heart and hand them back			0

@entity2 found his granddad 's @entity5 medals at a @entity8 museum
he spent two years looking for @entity30 's medal 's believing they were lost forever
a request to have them returned to the family was refused
mr @entity2 was told that the museum needed them more than he did
he has now started a petition to have them returned with 15,000 signatures
director of the museum said mr @entity30 asked for them to be left to the public in his will
