former @entity1 striker @entity0 , 25 , will leave prison on friday @entity0 will be released from jail as early as tomorrow with no electronic tag and nothing to stop him going back to a lucrative career in football			1
the news came as his former club raised the prospect of the convicted rapist returning to play for them			2
@entity1 manager @entity13 said ‘ one or two discussions ’ had been held about re-signing the centre forward , who originally cost the club £ 3million			1
@entity0 was on a reported salary of £ 20,000 a week before his conviction and remained in - contract for almost six weeks after he was jailed			1
last night @entity1 declined to say whether it had continued to pay his salary during that period			2
prison sources have indicated that @entity0 will walk free from @entity25 prison in @entity26 tomorrow			1
he will remain on licence for the next two and a half years , meaning he must adhere to certain conditions , including holding regular meetings with his probation officer			1
@entity0 will also be on the @entity31 indefinitely and can not change his address without telling the authorities			2
but prison service insiders revealed the footballer – who continues to protest his innocence – will not be subject to the same electronic monitoring as many other newly freed criminals			0
that is because @entity0 has served exactly half his five - year sentence – the normal point for release			1
electronic tagging is reserved for convicts released before the halfway point , under the so - called @entity47 regime			0
it removes the prospect of @entity0 returning to the football field wearing an ankle tag			2
sources said probation officials could still opt to place a curfew on @entity0 , but this would be highly unlikely to prevent him taking part in competitive football matches or training			0
restrictions on employment are applied only if the job would pose a danger to the public			0
the most likely issue would be if he joined a team based abroad or that had fixtures overseas , as he might need permission to leave the country			0
it could also have an impact on his international career if he resumes playing for @entity75			0
@entity0 has been an inmate at @entity25 in @entity26 , a specialist @entity77 jail for sex offenders @entity0 has been supported throughout by his longterm girlfriend , businessman 's daughter , @entity82 if @entity0 did return to @entity84 team @entity1 , it would be against the wishes of more than 145,000 people who have signed a change.org petition against him returning			1
fewer than 5,000 have signed a counter petition saying they wanted him back at the club			0
despite the furore , @entity1 manager @entity13 yesterday said a return remained possible – though he stopped short of endorsing such a move			1
he told @entity95 : ‘ we ’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it			1
it is above a football level			0
if he comes back then we [ the coaching staff ] will decide whether to play him or not			0
’ @entity13 added : ‘ it ’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back , it ’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place – that ’s theirs			2
’ @entity111 caused a storm when she said @entity0 ' crime ' was not violent ' and that the victims was drunk international : @entity0 may also be invited back to play for @entity75 - the team will take on @entity116 next month upon his conviction , @entity0 was not sacked by the club			1
he was jailed on april 20 , 2012 , and on may 30 of that year the club said it would not be renewing his contract			0
asked whether he was still paid during this time , a spokesman said last night : ‘ we have no comment to make on that			0
’ @entity126 , of the @entity125 , has argued that @entity0 should be allowed to return to the game , saying : ‘ i did n’t know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still ca n’t do anything			1
’ but @entity133 , the director of communications for @entity135 , has argued that barring @entity0 from the game would ‘ send a strong message condemning sexual violence against women ’ .			0
