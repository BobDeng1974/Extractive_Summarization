@entity0 and the @entity1 were last night said to be at war over a ' malicious ' and ' petty ' attempt to stop two of @entity6 's closest allies becoming mps conservative hq says the pair were kicked off the list after failing to campaign for the party in the recent @entity29 by - election that was won by @entity32			1
but both men insist that as special advisers – whose salaries come from the taxpayer – they were barred by their code of conduct from actively campaigning			1
they are understood to have been backed by mrs may , who is seen by many @entity41 as the favourite to succeed @entity43			0
however @entity44 claimed special advisers were given clearance to campaign in last month 's by - election by cabinet secretary sir @entity49 's office , and that all advisers had been told to canvass			1
mr @entity10 and mr @entity18 say they received no confirmation of this special clearance			2
one source said they had requested details from @entity57 , the @entity58 head of ethics and propriety , on seven occasions but received no reply			0
previous internal guidance on special advisers from @entity43 's political private secretary @entity65 , seen by the @entity66 , said they could help in by - elections ' in their own time and outside office hours , but only by providing backroom support , for example stuffing envelopes ... you could not do telephone campaigning or door - to - door canvassing '			2
mr @entity10 wanted to stand for @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80			0
@entity81 , chairman of the local @entity13 association , said it was ' deeply concerning and completely unacceptable ' that local activists had been ' deliberately misled ' by @entity44 about mr @entity10 when he ran for selection , which has a @entity13 majority of 15,266			2
party chiefs are accused of falsely telling local activists that he had withdrawn from the race before suspending him from its list of approved candidates			2
mrs @entity81 has told @entity13 chairman @entity95 that the constituency was suspending the selection of a candidate and demanding that he investigated the matter personally			0
@entity10 ( pictured ) , the home secretary 's most senior aide , has been blocked from running in a safe @entity13 seat at the general election in a letter , she told him that the committee considering candidates was ' told by a party official that mr @entity10 had withdrawn himself ' from the race			1
she added : ' this would appear not to be the case			0
' in a letter to her , mr @entity10 said he wanted to make clear it was ' untrue ' that he had withdrawn from the selection process , adding : ' i was informed that i have been suspended from the candidates ' list			2
this , i was told , is because i did not participate in telephone canvassing during the @entity29 by - election campaign			1
' this decision can not be valid because , as @entity6 's chief of staff , i am bound by the code of conduct for special advisers			1
' mr @entity10 , who has been blamed by @entity126 for fuelling speculation about mrs may 's leadership ambitions , declined to comment further last night			0
but a source said his treatment appeared ' malicious ' , ' petty ' and ' inept ' , given that if he was selected for a seat he would have to leave the home secretary 's side			0
@entity44 disputed some of mr @entity10 's claims			0
a party source insisted sir @entity49 's office and miss @entity57 had cleared special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing in @entity29 , as long as it was in their spare time , adding : ' it is not true that anyone said @entity10 had withdrawn , there will be no investigation			1
' mr @entity18 attempted to win the @entity13 candidacy in @entity150 , @entity151 , where @entity152 is mp and the @entity41 had a 23,386 majority in 2010			2
a @entity58 spokesman said : ' special advisers have always been able in their own time and outside office hours to take part in back - office activities			0
this approach was agreed with the @entity58			0
' he was unable to say whether telephone canvassing – which appears in clear breach of the rules – had been approved .			0
