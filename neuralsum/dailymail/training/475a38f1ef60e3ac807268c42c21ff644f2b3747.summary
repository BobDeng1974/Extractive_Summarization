by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 06:56 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 17:32 est , 26 october 2012 millions of families face a double - digit increase in the cost of gas and electricity after @entity8 became the latest energy supplier to announce a price hike			1
the firm – which has 5.5million customers and is the country ’s biggest electricity supplier – is raising tariffs by an average 10.8 per cent			0
it means the annual bill for a dual fuel customer who pays via monthly direct debit will be £ 1,252 – an increase of £ 123			0
heating up : @entity22 is pushing up gas and electricity bills for customers by nearly 11 per cent from december 7			0
it is the fifth of the ' big six ' energy firms to impose a price rise this winter			1
@entity8 is the fifth of the ‘ big six ’ energy firms to raise tariffs in the last few weeks			1
the sixth , @entity33 , is expected to follow suit in january			2
the companies have blamed government policies for the rise in prices , including requirements to pay for a switch to green and nuclear energy , and funding the insulation of cold homes			2
earlier this month , @entity45 told suppliers he intends to bring in legislation forcing them to offer customers the cheapest tariff			0
currently , 75 per cent of households are on their supplier ’s most expensive scheme , with 60 per cent admitting to having never switched firms in the past 15 years			0
@entity56 yesterday confirmed the law will be changed to force firms to charge a fair price			0
@entity60 , energy expert at customer group @entity61 , said : ‘ another price rise , hot on the heels of those we ’ve already seen , will again feed into consumer concerns on pack behaviour and whether price changes are driven by real supply and demand issues			1
’ @entity8 's 10.8 per cent hike , which will affect three million customers from december 7 , is due to rising cost of distribution , efficiency , buying energy and wholesale prices			1
@entity8 director @entity78 said : ' we know that customers will not welcome this news and do not want to see prices going up			2
' our new prices will however be cheaper on average than those of all the other major suppliers which have announced standard price rises so far this autumn			2
' rising bills : @entity8 's price rise , announced ahead of winter , will add £ 120 per year to household bills , affecting 3 million customers mr @entity78 also added that it is the first supplier to automatically switch vulnerable customers , for example those receiving pension credits , to its cheapest tariff , benefitting 85,000 customers			1
a nine per cent rise from @entity101 and @entity102 ( @entity103 ) started earlier this month , while price increases from @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 will hit customer bills before the end of the year			1
the @entity8 hike is the biggest percentage rise , so far , this year – however , a spokesman said that its average price is still cheapest average tariff , even after the increase			1
it brings an @entity8 annual duel fuel direct debit bill to an average of £ 1,251 , just £ 7 cheaper than its nearest rival @entity107 which will charge customers £ 1,258 annually , after its rise			2
@entity60 , from @entity61 , said : ' the latest energy price rise will leave even more customers worried about their energy bills			1
' @entity22 ’s tariffs will still be slightly cheaper on average than other suppliers who have increased their prices – but this will be little comfort to those seeing a double - digit percentage rise on their bills			2
' the news will come as a blow to millions of households who have little escape from energy price rises this winter just as the cold weather hits			0
@entity144 , from @entity145 , said : ' this is the final hammer blow for energy bills this side of @entity149			0
consumers now face a winter of rationing their energy usage - many will be forced to turned their heating down or off for fear of the impact of these hikes			0
' how much ? how @entity22 compares in the average duel fuel bill price league after the hike @entity160 , from @entity161 , said : ' the energy price rise domino effect is in full swing , and we expect @entity33 to make their announcement soon for price increases in the @entity167			1
' @entity22 said that the rise is due to sharp increases in its costs since the start of the year , with distribution charges going up by 9 per cent and energy efficiency schemes increasing by more than 50 per cent			2
a spokesman also said that the cost of buying energy had gone up by 4 per cent , a fee which makes up around 50 per cent of the typical gas and electricity bill			0
@entity180 , an energy analyst at @entity181 , said the current price rises were just the start , with further increases in bills expected next year			1
he said : ' wholesale gas and power prices have risen by approximately 8 per cent since the lows seen in june , and investment in cleaner forms of generation is still costly and these increases were always going to be passed onto the consumer			0
' these rises come at a time when household budgets are already stretched and , despite the positive gdp figures released yesterday , the @entity195 economy continues to struggle			0
' in addition , more gas will be needed as a fuel for power generation from 2013 onwards with older , more pollutant coal power stations coming offline due to emission regulations			0
' as gas burn is much more expensive than coal burn currently , the recent spate of price rises could be in anticipation of higher wholesale prices in the future			1

@entity8 's announced price rise will add £ 120 a year to household bills
@entity33 is the only big supplier not to raise prices but is expected to once its promise to hold prices expires at the end of the year
energy firms blame rising wholesale prices and increased running costs
