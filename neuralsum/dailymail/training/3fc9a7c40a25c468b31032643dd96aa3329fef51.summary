@entity1 fans know a bit about managerial changes so perhaps they thought they were on to something when they started warning @entity5 he would be out of work in the morning			2
it turns out they may have been premature words on a couple of counts , not least because they were delivered after 35 minutes when @entity1 were 3 - 0 up courtesy of a @entity13 hat - trick			2
@entity1 forward @entity13 celebrates his third goal to complete a first half hat - trick @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity16 6 ; @entity17 6 , @entity18 6 , @entity19 6 , @entity20 6.5 ; @entity21 6 , @entity22 7 ( @entity23 57 , 6 ) , @entity24 6.5 ; kačaniklić 6.5 ; @entity13 8 , @entity25 6.5 ( @entity26 77 ) subs not used : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , burn booked : @entity17 , @entity32 @entity33 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity34 7 ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 5.5 , @entity37 5.5 , @entity38 5 ( @entity39 31 , 6 ) ; @entity40 6.5 , @entity41 6 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 6 ; @entity45 5 subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ref : @entity53 5 att : 15,512 @entity54 : @entity13 what followed was an impressive two - goal comeback which , by consolation , added a lick of gloss to what might have been a dreadful night for @entity5			1
but a defeat is a defeat and while these numbers were not as bad as they might have been , there was no escaping the truth in the wider figures since these sides last met			0
it is scarcely believable that following that 5 - 3 @entity33 win in september , @entity5 ’s side were top of the championship with 17 points from seven games ; @entity1 were bottom with one and immediately sacked @entity75			1
moving on four months , @entity33 have managed 17 points in the next 20 games and @entity1 33 under @entity78			2
even points overall , but one side is upwardly mobile and the other is sinking quickly			0
the win over @entity83 at the weekend was popular and important for @entity5 , but how much leeway will that buy him ? forest sources maintained last night that his job is not under immediate threat , but the cracks are obvious , even before you consider how his defence operated in the first half here			1
owner @entity92 is already understood to have his reservations and it will not have gone unnoticed that when @entity38 was substituted midway through a dreadful first half , he stormed past @entity97 without shaking hands			0
@entity1 forward @entity13 scores the opening goal against @entity33 @entity13 scores @entity1 's second goal against @entity33 at @entity102 by then , @entity33 were two down to an £ 11million striker who has found some form in a mixed season			1
he brought a stunning save from @entity107 inside two minutes and within seven had opened the scoring with a low shot from the edge of the area			0
he scored his second from a similar range 11 minutes later and a deflected shot off @entity35 completed his hat - trick and ninth goal of the season			1
‘ you ’re getting sacked in the morning , ’ sang the @entity1 fans			0
then came the fight back			0
@entity119 pulled one back in stoppage time with what was @entity33 ’s first shot on target and a second shortly after the hour made it interesting			1
@entity127 then missed a glorious chance inside the six - yard box and @entity42 ’s late header was saved by @entity132 ’s face			0
not enough for @entity5 , but he will know this could have been worse			0
@entity1 fans celebrate third goal in front of @entity33 chairman @entity92 @entity33 boss @entity5 and no 2 @entity137 ca n't hide their disappointment @entity22 of @entity1 challenges @entity42 of @entity33 on wednesday night			1

@entity13 took his goal tally to 10 with three long - range strikes
@entity33 *threatened* a comeback when @entity119 scored either side of half - time
@entity5 had hoped @entity33 had turned a corner after a *dramatic* 2 - 1 win at *rivals* @entity83 on *saturday*
