the @entity1 signed up to government spending plans in private but now ' slag them off ' in public , @entity0 claimed today as a coalition row erupted over the scale of cuts needed			1
the chancellor hit back at @entity1 @entity9 who has claimed @entity10 plans to dramatically reduce spending were ' wholly unrealistic '			1
@entity12 was also forced to deny trying to distance himself from his own government after snubbing mr @entity0 's @entity14 for a photocall in @entity16			1
but the @entity25 warned only 40 per cent of the cuts needed have been made so far			0
the @entity27 have made clear they would seek to balance the books through spending cuts alone , with cutting welfare the top priority			1
but mr @entity12 has branded the approach ' complete and utter nonsense ' and insisted there must also be tax rises			1
and mr @entity9 said he had made ' very , very clear ' his opposition to @entity10 plans to achieve the goal by cutting departmental budgets and welfare , without increasing taxes on the wealthy			1
the business secretary said his conservative colleagues wanted to cut public spending ' rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable ' and their plans were ' simply not realisable '			1
the @entity1 criticism triggered a furious response from mr @entity0			1
he told @entity48 : ' in private , they sign up to all these decisions and then in public they slag them off			0
but that 's for them to explain to you			0
' @entity1 deputy prime minister missed the @entity14 in the @entity56 yesterday to visit flood defences in @entity58 , @entity16 with local mp @entity59 ( left ) @entity60 dem business secretary @entity9 said he had made ' very , very clear ' his opposition to @entity10 plans to achieve the goal by cutting departmental budgets and welfare , without increasing taxes on the wealthy mr @entity0 also mocked mr @entity12 's decision to visit flood defences in @entity58 instead of being in the @entity56 yesterday			1
' he can choose to be anywhere he wants in the country , ' mr @entity0 said			0
mr @entity12 denied trying to distance himself from the measures announced yesterday			1
speaking during his weekly phone - in on @entity69 , he said : ' i 've been doing autumn statements and budgets for five years now and sitting dutifully there			0
and , by the way , of course i have worked on this meticulously for weeks			0
' everything in that @entity14 is in there because we have agreed it and i fully support it			1
' but , then i had a choice - did i listen to @entity82 in the @entity83 or did i go out and talk to normal people ? ' public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity25 's forecasts of spending cuts spending by government departments will fall to just 12 per cent of gdp			2
if health , schools and foreign aid are protected , other areas will be severely squeezed @entity0 clashed with @entity97 presenter @entity96 @entity0 today hit out at the @entity99 ’s ‘ hyperbolic ’ coverage of spending cuts , accusing the broadcaster of predicting the world would fall in			2
the chancellor clashed with radio 4 today programme host @entity96 about questions on the state of the country ’s finances			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ when i woke up this morning and turned on the today programme i felt like i was listening to a rewind of a tape from 2010			0
‘ you had @entity99 correspondents saying @entity114 is returning to a sort of @entity117 world of @entity118			0
’ @entity117 ’s bleak book chronicled poverty , hunger and social injustice in the north of @entity124 in the 1930s			0
mr @entity0 repeatedly hit back at @entity126 ’ ‘ nonsense ’ questioning , adding : ‘ i would have thought the @entity99 would have learned from the last four years that its totally hyperbolic coverage of spending cuts has not been matched by what has actually happened			1
‘ i had all that when you interviewed me four years , and has the world fallen in ? no it has n’t			0
‘ the @entity114 economy is growing and the deficit is half what it was when i was doing those interviews			0
’ last month work and pensions secretary @entity140 accused the @entity99 of being ' utterly negative ' about the government 's flagship welfare reforms , and challenged claims by today present @entity144 that it had been ‘ dogged ’ by problems			0
asked why he ever attended the @entity56 , mr @entity12 replied : ' that 's a good question , actually			1
' pressed on whether he had ' propped up ' the @entity27 , he said : ' no , it 's not propped up , far from it			0
' he insisted : ' it is a liberal democrat @entity14 just as much as anything else and this economic recovery would n't be happening without the @entity1			1
' and , by the way , all this complete nonsense tittle - tattle about @entity9 here or @entity159 there			1
what @entity9 , @entity159 and indeed myself have been saying for ages is that we proudly stand together in this coalition government to sort out the mess created by @entity82			1
' as for the future , clearly we have a completely different approach to the conservatives			0
' government sources said mr @entity9 had ' erupted ' during yesterday 's cabinet meeting and told fellow @entity1 , including chief treasury secretary @entity159 , that they had not signed up to the @entity10 ' spending plans beyond the general election			1
mr @entity0 remains committed to balancing the budget – spending less than is raised in tax – by 2017 - 18			2
but to do so will require deep spending cuts			2
total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of @entity175 in 2019 - 20 – the lowest level for 80 years			2
it marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009 - 10 , the last year of the @entity180 government			0
in the mid- 1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy			2
just 40 per cent of the spending cuts needed have been made so far , with the remaining 60 per cent to come in the next five years			2
the @entity27 and @entity1 committed in the @entity185 to protecting health , schools and foreign aid spending			1
it means other departments face much deeper cuts of up to 50 per cent to find the money needed to eradicate the deficit			0
the @entity25 expects @entity195 spending to rise from £ 108.4billion this year to £ 110.2billion in 2019 - 20			2
but spending on unprotected budgets like defence , transport , business and councils will fall from £ 147.1billion to just £ 85.6billion			0
during the decade to 2020 , spending per person on unprotected areas will fall from £ 3,020 to just £ 1,290			0
the @entity25 said : ' the implied cuts ... during the next @entity204 would pose a significant challenge if they were confirmed as firm policy , one that would be all the greater if existing protections were maintained			0
