by @entity0 published : 01:57 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 4 june 2013 government plans to overhaul legal aid threaten to destroy @entity6 's ' world renowned ' system of fair justice , a former judge warned today			1
sir @entity8 , who retired as a @entity10 judge last year , hit out at @entity12 reforms to cut £ 220million from the legal aid budget			1
under the proposals , organisations would compete for contracts by offering the lowest price , with companies like logistics group the @entity19 among those bidding			1
but sir @entity8 said this would deny defendants the long - held right to choose their solicitor and instead create a system where the quality of representation on offer would be vastly reduced			1
chairman of the @entity31 , @entity30 ( left ) , and retired judge sir @entity8 ( right ) have criticised plans to cut £ 220million from the legal aid system speaking on @entity35 's @entity34 , sir @entity8 said : ' at the moment , solicitors compete on quality			1
' in the new system , there will be no competition on quality because they will be randomly allocated			2
‘ the government says it is replacing competition with something called @entity46 – which , quite frankly , just sounds like gobbledygook			0
’ in the case of people with disabilities , this may result in a lawyer who does n't have the right expertise for their particular needs being selected , he told the @entity35			0
sir @entity8 claimed the new system would see who firms of specialist law firms , such as those who help war veterans and the mentally ill , will simply ' disappear off the map '			0
he told the @entity63 : ‘ these proposals by the inaptly named justice secretary are fundamentally flawed and must be rejected in whole			0
’ he was speaking after the @entity31 , which represents barristers in @entity68 and @entity69 , has published its response to the reforms			2
the 150 - page response said price competitive tendering ( @entity74 ) promotes the ' lowest possible quality of service ' and will result in further changes to civil legal aid , hitting society 's most vulnerable people			1
' threat to justice ' : under the proposals , organisations would compete for contracts by price , with companies such as logistics firm the @entity19 bidding for work other changes will see criminal defendants living in households with a disposable income of £ 37,500 or more stopped from automatically accessing legal aid , while prisoners ' rights to the support will also would be curbed			1
@entity97 , chairman of the @entity31 , said : ' there is no avoiding the simple fact that these proposals would move us from having a justice system which is admired all over the world , to a system where price trumps all			1
' @entity74 may look as though it achieves short - term savings , but it is a blunt instrument that will leave deep scars on our justice system for far longer			2
' further cuts to the scope of civil legal aid will limit access to justice for some of the most vulnerable			2
that is a legacy of which no government should be proud			0
' she added : ' the proposals simply do not have a sufficient evidence base on which to attract support			0
we believe that if these proposals are implemented as they stand , the system will go very badly wrong			0
once implemented , these measures can not be easily reversed			0
' ms @entity97 said justice secretary @entity125 should achieve any required reforms ' without destroying a world - renowned institution '			1
the @entity31 response said that the proposals would destroy the livelihoods of many smaller solicitors ' firms and the criminal defence bar			1
standing firm : justice secretary @entity125 says the legal sector can not be immune from government cuts and costs paid to lawyer should ' reflect this ' criminal legal aid costs taxpayers more than £ 1 billion every year and the proposals should cut the bill by £ 220 million			1
in april , reforms to the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) came into effect , removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid			0
some law firms estimated the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent , meaning around 200,000 fewer cases , while barristers warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced in 1949			1
in its response to the consultation , the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , the body responsible for regulating barristers , said plans to pay legal aid lawyers the same amount for a ' guilty ' or ' not guilty ' plea could lead to defendants being pressurised into pleading guilty			1
it said cases where the defendant enters an initial guilty plea are typically shorter and so cheaper than trials to assess guilt			0
setting the same fee for cases where a defendant pleads guilty and for longer trials may create an incentive for lawyers to encourage clients to plead guilty			0
@entity162 chair baroness @entity182 said : ' these reforms may endanger the ability of our legal system to guarantee everyone a fair trial			1
' while we accept that the current austerity measures are a consequence of the financial climate , protecting the public , and ensuring criminal cases are dealt with fairly and justly , remain of the utmost importance			0
' mr @entity125 said : ' we have one of the best legal professions in the world			2
' but at a time of major financial challenges , the legal sector can not be excluded from the government 's commitment to getting better value for taxpayers ' money			0
we believe costs paid to lawyers through legal aid should reflect this			0
' professional , qualified lawyers will be available , just as they are now , and contracts will only be awarded to lawyers who meet quality standards set by the profession			0
' wealthy defendants who can afford to pay for their own legal bills should do so			2
our proposal is to introduce a threshold on @entity219 legal aid so that people earning around £ 100,000 a year are no longer automatically granted legal aid			2
' we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world , with about £ 1 billion a year spent just on criminal legal aid			1
' these changes are about getting the best value for the taxpayer and will not in any way affect someone 's right to a fair trial			0

@entity31 says £ 220m cuts would destroy ' world - renowned ' legal system
organisations would compete for contracts by offering the lowest price
companies like logistics firm the @entity19 among those bidding
retired judge says plans would scrap right of defendants to choose lawyer
