in two years chancellor @entity1 will be taking £ 1billion a year in tax from lottery tickets , it has been forecast the biggest winner from the imminent revamp of the @entity7 will be the @entity8 , independent analysts said yesterday			1
they forecast that two years from now , chancellor @entity1 will be taking £ 1billion a year in tax from lottery tickets – almost double the @entity12 ’s share of the takings before the onset of the economic downturn			1
the estimate means the @entity8 is due to double its money following the doubling of the price of a @entity21 ticket to £ 2 this autumn			1
analysts @entity22 said the record take for the government reflects the efficiency of @entity28 ’s stewardship of the lottery and the affordability of @entity21 and @entity32 tickets and scratch cards			2
but critics say ministers are increasing a stealth tax on those who have a flutter in the belief that they are helping good causes			1
the new estimates come in advance of the first increase in the price of tickets for the main @entity21 game since it was launched nearly 20 years ago			1
the relaunch is designed to bring regular £ 5million weekend jackpots , but a family accustomed to a £ 5 weekly gamble will find themselves paying £ 10 for the same chance of winning			0
duty paid on @entity7 tickets runs at 12 per cent , and from the game ’s beginnings in 1994 until 2007 the amount paid to the @entity8 each year ran at between £ 500million and £ 600million			2
but the government ’s take has been rising steeply in line with tickets since the onset of the downturn , the figures show			0
it topped £ 800million last year and will hit £ 1billion in two years ’ time , they indicated			2
the estimate means the @entity8 is due to double its money following the doubling of the price of a @entity21 ticket to £ 2 this autumn for every £ 1 spent on the lottery , 50p is paid to winners , 28p goes to good causes , 5p to retailers , 5p to the operator – and 12p to the @entity8			1
the report from @entity22 , @entity80 and @entity81 , said : ‘ the last few years have each seen record - breaking amounts of duty generated by the @entity7 ’s performance			0
the forthcoming ticket and prize increases will spur further sales increases and , therefore , increase the amount the government receives in duty			0
’ but economist @entity91 of the @entity92 said : ‘ the lottery was always sold on the basis that … players were first and foremost supporting good causes			0
‘ people might be unpleasantly surprised at how much they are paying to @entity89			0

@entity8 to double its money when the price of a @entity21 ticket doubles to £ 2
critics say it *'s* a stealth tax on those who believe they *'re* helping *charity*
this year sees first @entity21 price increase in 20 year *history*
