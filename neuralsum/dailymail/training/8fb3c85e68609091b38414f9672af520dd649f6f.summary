by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 14:51 est , 21 august 2012 @entity1 leaves @entity2 where she is suing @entity3 for unfair dismissal from her job as a counsellor at @entity7 a counsellor wrote to one of @entity12 's most dangerous men telling him how special he was before ordering him ' now eat this card ' , an employment tribunal has heard			1
@entity1 would enter patients ' rooms alone on a ward for the most high - risk and dangerous patients at top - security @entity19 psychiatric hospital			1
it was alleged that the trained martial artist , who worked as a clinical team leader , tolerated inappropriate conduct which culminated in a therapy assistant friend resigning amid accusations of a sexual relationship with two patients			2
@entity29 was sacked after handing a junior colleague a packet of sweets , to give to a patient being held under section in the top security wing , along with the bizarre card - which asked him to dispose of it by eating it , the tribunal heard			1
the card told the unnamed man he was ' very special '			2
@entity29 was also said to have given patients food and sworn openly on the ward , the employment judge was told			1
she is suing the hospital 's management - @entity3 - for unfair dismissal over the allegations of serious security breaches			1
@entity51 , @entity19 's director of security , said : ' we reviewed the card that ms @entity1 had given to a patient			1
' the wording was akin to terms of endearment as if ms @entity1 was trying to tell the patient that he was very special to her			1
' this was completely at odds with a professional relationship and ms @entity1 's remark " now eat this card " was sending a message to the patient that she knew that this action completely flouted trust policy and she was seeking the patient 's collusion in this regard			1
' the wording of the card indicated that @entity29 had a special relationship with the patient which was of a personal nature			1
' from other cases i 've seen actions of this kind can lead to boundary violations of a more serious nature that can include criminal offences			0
' the security breach came just months after a friend and colleague who she had closely mentored resigned when a letter she had penned for another inmate was handed to staff			2
the note revealed the therapy assistant , who has not been named , had an inappropriate relationship with the detained man , who accused her of having sex with him and another patient			2
in the bombshell revelation he demanded an hiv test , fearing the sexual indiscretion could have led to him contracting the disease			0
the relationship had been developing since christmas 2009 under ms @entity1 's nose while she was supposed to be mentoring her , and the pair had repeated conversations about stopping contact between them			1
@entity19 , the high - security psychiatric hospital in @entity109 , @entity110 , houses some of @entity12 's most dangerous patients however , the carer was only moved in the summer of 2010 when another post became available on a different ward			1
at the time the patient broke his silence there were said to be two copies of the note , one was held by managers while the other was thought to have been eaten by the recipient in order to dispose of it			2
the instruction to ' eat this card ' contained in @entity29 's own note was said to be a sign that she knew her actions were wrong and wanted him to dispose of the evidence			1
during disciplinary interviews she admitted what she did was wrong but explained it by saying she was upset about the suspension of her manager , who had faced internal action over failures relating to the sex scandal			0
' the patients within the unit consist of mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as murder , rape or paedophilia			2
' @entity155 , @entity19 @entity29 justified venturing into bedrooms alone up to four times by saying she was a skilled martial artist and could handle herself , the tribunal , sitting in @entity161 , @entity110 , heard			1
among the barrage of allegations levelled at her was the claim she regularly swore back at inmates when they used four letter words towards her			0
@entity155 , the hospital 's service director for personality disorder patients , said : ' the language used by ms @entity1 in the card was particularly concerning			1
' ms @entity1 had stated in the card that she treasured working with the particular patient			1
' we considered that this language was highly emotive and completely inappropriate within the confines of a professional relationship in the high secure hospital			1
' this in itself was a clear breach of professional boundaries between ms @entity1 and the patient which , given ms @entity1 's seniority , was very concerning			1
' she added : ' taking all of the allegations into consideration we considered that ms @entity1 's actions had amounted to gross misconduct and that she should have been summarily dismissed from her post			1
' the tribunal heard that while there were allegations of an unprofessional relationship there were no claims of a sexual relationship between them			0
however , ms @entity155 described how the scheming and manipulative patients at the @entity203 would groom staff			2
she said : ' the @entity205 , which is located in the @entity206 , houses some of the most seriously disordered and dangerous patients within @entity19			2
' this was one of two @entity210 units within the @entity12 treating this category of patient			2
' the @entity205 was set up in 2000 as part of a national pilot , as a result of the government 's manifesto dealing with public protection issues			0
' patients within the unit are categorised as people who pose a high risk of causing physical or psychological harm to others			1
' the patients within the unit consist of mostly young men who suffer from serious personality disorders who as a result of their disorders have committed very serious crimes such as murder , rape or paedophilia			0
' she added : ' these individuals are highly manipulative and often seek out vulnerable members of staff and attempt to groom them for inappropriate relationships and obtain prohibited items to be brought into the hospital			0
' the risk to safety presented by these patients is therefore often more likely psychological rather than physical			1
' @entity29 , from @entity161 , @entity110 , was fired after a disciplinary hearing on may 26 last year			1
@entity12 's @entity248 , @entity249 , who killed four people , one of whom he ate			0
he was a patient at @entity19 @entity19 was the first custom - built asylum to house criminal lunatics , constructed in 1863			2
the idea was triggered by the case of @entity257 , an ex-soldier who , in 1800 , while watching a play at the @entity259 , levelled his pistol at @entity261 and fired at him			0
he missed , but his subsequent acquittal by reason of insanity caused such public uproar that @entity267 speedily passed the @entity268 to provide for the indefinite detention of the insane , and a new institution was born , ' intended for the reception , safe custody and treatment of persons who had committed crimes while actually insane or who became insane while undergoing sentences of punishment '			0
the possible causes of insanity were listed as ' anxiety , epilepsy , intemperance , vice , poverty , religious excitement , fright and exposure to hot climates '			0
the 53 - acre high - security psychiatric hospital , which now holds roughly 230 men , initially had room for 400 men and 100 women			1
among the first inmates were two would - be assassins of @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299			0
@entity298 was 18 and serving beer in a pub when in 1840 he tried to shoot the @entity302 and @entity303 as they rode out on @entity305			0
@entity306 ( pictured ) and @entity307 murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 both bullets missed , and they were later found to be blanks			0
@entity299 was judged insane after he fired a revolver point - blank at the @entity302 - and missed - in 1882 as she left @entity313 train station			0
other notable past inmates have included notorious child killer @entity315 , the @entity12 's longest - serving prisoner , who died in jail , 55 years after being convicted of murdering a schoolgirl			2
the @entity318 , moors murderer @entity306 and the @entity320 , @entity320 , have all been held at the hospital			0
perhaps the most notorious is one who few of @entity19 's residents ever saw , the original @entity322			0
@entity249 was in @entity19 for three years in the @entity324 after he killed four people , one of whom he ate			0
he was nicknamed spoons after @entity328 and another psychopath took a @entity19 patient , a paedophile , and barricaded themselves into a cell with him			0
the paedophile was tortured for nine hours before @entity249 garrotted him and held up his body so that the staff could see him through the spy hatch			0
when the staff were let in , they found that the man 's skull had been cracked open like a boiled egg , with part of the brain missing and spoon hanging out of the cranium .			0
