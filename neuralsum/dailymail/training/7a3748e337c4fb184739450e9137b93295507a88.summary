by @entity0 they are hound dogs who love the thrill of the chase			0
but while @entity7 usually track rabbits and deer , in @entity10 a pack of the dogs are having more fun pursuing a remote control car			1
@entity14 man @entity13 captured his beagles chasing the toy around a park during one of his regular meet - ups with the unofficial @entity20 of @entity21			1
mr @entity13 posted the video , which has now been watched over 200,000 times , on @entity24 and one commenter exclaimed : ' i could watch this all day			1
the ' @entity45 ' , as he called it , took place @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity21			1
the @entity7 are heard barking frantically as they run and chase a blue and red remote control car around an obstacle course and through a tunnel in the video			1
a man in blue shorts and a cap stands in the middle of the track with the controls , as others watch the dogs from the sidelines of the pen			2
but the video ends before the dogs actually catch the car			0
thrill of the chase ! the pack were playing in @entity69 in @entity48 , @entity21 it 's mine ! the dogs almost caught the car before it entered a tunnel ' we met up with some fellow @entity7 owners and took some photos of our pack chasing a radio control car around			1
they enjoyed it - a lot , ' mr @entity13 wrote on @entity82			1
he also posted photos on image sharing website @entity84 , explaining : ' i think the photos better highlight the majesty of the ears and jowls flying everywhere			0
' one @entity24 user called @entity92 commented on the video : ' i have 5 beagles and i found this hilarious ! ' these beagles are having fun and doing what comes naturally : chasing something			2
beagles were originally bred to hunt rabbits , and they are wonderful at it			0
' high and low : the pooches climbed over obstacles to get to the car @entity106 added : ' this is awesome ... i need to get one for my @entity7 to chase lol			0
or find a doggy park full of beagles ! ﻿ ' however , another @entity24 user , mr @entity111 , said the video was cruel : ' those dogs have no idea what that car is and you can tell by the noises they 're making that they are really scared			2
' while please @entity120 me blasted the video as : ' animal cruelty			0
this will severely psychologically damage a dog as they are chasing for an object they can never catch			0
this leads to depression and weight gain			0
﻿ ' a spokesperson for the @entity132 in @entity21 told @entity133 : ' we would n't be investigating something like this as animal cruelty			2
