@entity0 , inevitably , fired the conspiracy that the @entity3 @entity2 was fixed for @entity4 to win			1
so it was there that @entity7 scotched the idea			2
they posted : ‘ breaking news : dramatic news in the skies over @entity13 as # @entity15 hands # @entity3 gp victory to # f1 @entity19 rival # @entity17			1
’ they illustrated the tweet with a picture of three pigs flying above rural @entity24			2
it was a neat satirical touch and supported the prevailing view of paddock observers that @entity28 merely made a mistake at the first chicane , ran off the track and unwittingly allowed team - mate @entity4 to take the lead			1
a conspiracy ? ‘ spare me ! ’ he said			0
‘ no , we did n’t give the conspiracy theory a moment ’s thought at the time			0
this sort of speculation might be good for people to talk about , but if @entity7 had wanted to fix the result they would n’t have done it like that			2
they would have found a more subtle way to do it			0
‘ a few drivers had problems there in practice , including @entity28			2
i really do n’t think there is anything in it			0
’ the most obvious argument against the theory is that @entity28 would surely never have followed any instruction to let @entity4 pass			1
he is hell - bent on winning the world title in what he perceives as his career - defining season			0
had @entity7 ordered him to give way to make up for his part in the infamous crash with @entity4 in @entity78 , it is unimaginable that he would have done anything other than flatly refuse to do so			1
speaking from @entity80 in his post-race blog , @entity28 , who leads @entity4 by 22 points at the top of the championship , said : ‘ @entity4 was quick and i had to step up my game and tried to get that little bit extra out of it and i messed up			1
‘ i could have made the corner but the risk is so big that my front tyre would be square from the lock - up , so the safer way , and the best way , and the only way was to go straight on			0
at least i would not have to do another pit stop and change tyres			0
’ @entity34 marked the traditional end of the @entity100 season , though the @entity101 @entity2 makes its debut in @entity103 next month			2
with six races remaining , @entity4 is exuding a more positive mental state			0
can the momentum keep swinging his way after @entity28 ’s purple patch ? ‘ @entity34 was a big positive and a step up the massive staircase i have to face , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ @entity111 will tell how the psychological battle will go			0
’ key moment : @entity28 took to the escape road allowing @entity4 to pass his @entity7 team - mate rivals : @entity4 narrowed the gap to @entity28 with six races of the season remaining off road : the @entity122 driver was fined a six - figure sum after his crash with @entity4 in @entity125 @entity126 returns to winning ways			1
