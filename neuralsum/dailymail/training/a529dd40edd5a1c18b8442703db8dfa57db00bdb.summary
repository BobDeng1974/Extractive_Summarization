' the ' disturbing and troubling exhibition ' was put together after museum curator discovered boxes of @entity11 's journals , letters and photographs that document how he went about his dubious methods			2

no bones are part of the current exhibit calling himself ' dr ' , despite there being no evidence he even graduated from high school , @entity11 is thought to have rifled through 801 grave - sites from 105 individual locations around @entity80			1
his methods allowed him to accumulate one of the largest collection of human remains and artifacts of the native peoples of @entity80 and by the 1920s he was enjoying fame and fortune , dining with the nation 's wealthiest men			1
shrewdly using the media to promote his own aims , @entity11 hired an @entity159 journalist to become his personal publicist , transforming himself into ' the famous archaelogist @entity11 ' - complete with funding from oil baron @entity162			2
his finds made their way across the @entity166 to prestigious institutions and he made fantastical claims to have unearthed a mythical prehistoric race of blue - eyed , giant @entity84			1

political sensitivities and the law were not against his actions at the time and within a short time he had amassed a collection that the @entity211 said ' would make any curator in this nation envious			0
' by 1918 he had entered into his partnership with @entity215 and sold his loot to his @entity217 in @entity184			0
in 1922 , the @entity162 suddenly reduced its funding to @entity11 and in april of 1924 cut all money for excavation of the islands burial sites			0
his only source of income was his grizzly museum of human bones that overlooked @entity28 's harbor			2
a fresh interest in archaeology provided by @entity231 's discovery of the tomb of @entity233 in 1923 gave @entity11 a boost - leading to him spinning his wondrous yarns about giants and princesses found on the small @entity238 island off the coast of @entity17			2
he also built an island museum that incorporated @entity4 bones as architectural elements , including windows edged with finger and toe bones , leg and arm bones as shelf brackets and ceiling panels decorated with vertebra and shoulder blades media interest descended and articles by @entity254 , the @entity255 and the @entity256 all showed up the ' dr 's ' empty boasts			2

after his death in 1968 , the secret was revealed to be less than 10 pages of text			0
@entity276 , 89 , of @entity28 recalled hiking up a hill to the museum in the 1930s and paying 35 cents to get inside			0
