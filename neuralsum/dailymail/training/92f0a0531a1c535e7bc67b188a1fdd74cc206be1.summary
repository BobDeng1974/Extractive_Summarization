@entity0 said a new law on flexible working hours would allow workers in their 50s and 60s to take time - out for several months millions of workers approaching state pension age could use flexible working laws to demand ‘ retirement leave ’ , the government ’s older people ’s tsar has said			1
pensions expert @entity0 said this would allow workers to take a sabbatical of several months before returning , possibly part - time			1
three months ago the government introduced a law which gave all employees the legal right to request flexible working , not just parents and carers			1
employers must consider the request and offer an appeal if it is refused			2
crucially , they can not discriminate based on why employees want to change their hours			0
dr @entity0 , the government ’s new @entity28 and the former head of @entity31 , said many workers in their fifties and sixties would use the law to take time - out for several months to do things such as travel the world or spend more time with family , before coming back ‘ refreshed ’			1
she said the concept of ‘ retirement leave ’ would hopefully be embraced by employers but , ‘ if employers do n’t embrace it on their own ’ , it could potentially become part of legislation in the future			1
‘ we need to offer flexible working just like we have done for working mothers ’ , she said			1
‘ there is no reason we can not have a concept like maternity leave , a retirement leave , where you take a break before you come back , and then perhaps come back part - time			1
‘ a lot of people when they look forward to retirement are looking forward to a break , but once they have retired and got the gold watch , it is then very hard to get back into work if you want to			2
‘ now , with the request for flexible working extended to everybody there is an opportunity to do that			1
‘ i would really encourage people to use the law to ask for a period of leave , and for employers to treat the idea seriously , because it could be in their long - term interest as well			2
’ she said less than ten per cent of the generation coming up for retirement had been to university , let alone taken a gap year , and had worked since school			2
‘ maybe they could take a few months out and come back part time having been refreshed , ’ she added			2
‘ at the moment it is all voluntary – you have the right to request although the employer does n’t have to agree			0
‘ however , 90 per cent of requests for flexible working have been granted so far			2
’ she went on : ‘ what people think of as the retirement dream is an easier life but that does not , for many people , equate to no work at all – they may not want the same pressure or workload and move to two or three days instead			0
’ she warned there was ' no reason ' why there can not be a concept of retirement leave , like maternity leave , allowing a person to perhaps go back to work part - time dr @entity0 said a combination of people living longer and a lack of retirement funds meant that working into your 70s would become the norm in the next five to ten years			1
fathers work harder than men who do not have children , according to an analysis of working lives in the @entity122			0
men with children who live with them are more than twice as likely to hold down a job than men without families or men living apart from their children			0
the rule holds good across @entity131 according to the study , based on government surveys , by @entity122 statistics arm @entity134			0
nearly one in three women aged 25 to 54 with children under six were economically inactive last year – without a job and not seeking one – compared to fewer than one in five women without children			0
by contrast , only 4.2 per cent of men with one or more children in their household were economically inactive , compared to 9.9 per cent of men without children in their home			0
financial advisers @entity149 predicted yesterday that the number of over- 65s still in the workforce could more than triple from 870,000 in 2010 to three million by 2037 , based on factors such as population growth and the rise in state pension age			0
by 2037 , life expectation in the @entity158 will have risen from 79 to 82 for men and from 84 to 87 for women			0
@entity161 , head of pensions research at @entity149 , said : ‘ inevitably we ’re going to see more people looking to work on into their late sixties and seventies			0
‘ the challenge for the government is to make it easier for people to retrain and to find new ways of earning a living			0
one option would be to look at tax breaks for employers giving training courses to the over- 55s			0
’ pensions minister @entity177 said he did not believe the concept of ‘ retirement leave ’ would become a legal right , but instead be agreed between workers and employers			1
he said : ‘ three out of five requests [ across all ages ] for flexible working are granted straight away and four out of five after a short time , so i do n’t think this is something government needs to prescribe			1
it works better as a “ do - it - yourself retirement leave ”			1

@entity0 said ' retirement leave ' could soon become a normal concept
said those in 50s and 60s could take sabbatical before returning part - time
' we need to offer flexible working , just like we have done for mothers '
