this is the secret weapon which @entity1 hoped would help destroy @entity2 during @entity3 although 5,000 v1 rockets were launched by the @entity6 from @entity7 and @entity8 to bomb @entity2 , this is a rare @entity9 - style version			1
because the aim of the rockets was so random - the bombs dropped when they ran out of fuel - 150 of them were modified with a small cockpit so they could be flown accurately into targets			1
dangerous : this is the secret weapon which @entity1 hoped would help him to defeat the @entity18 lethal : this is a rare @entity9 - style version of the v1 rocket which included a small cockpit so it could be flown accurately			1
it is pictured on display at the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 in a high - risk move , the pilot was meant to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph			1
none of the piloted rockets ever flew in anger , partly due to the lack of airmen willing to volunteer with the exception of a few @entity1 fanatics			1
this manned version of the fearsome flying missile , that was effectively a suicidal experiment by the @entity6 , has been owned by a @entity47 museum for over 40 years			1
the piloted rocket was sent back to @entity6 to be restored by experts there to the condition it was in when it was found and seized by the @entity18 at the end of @entity3 now complete after the £ 40,000 project , it is being returned by road to the museum in @entity26			1
only six of them exist today , including the one that has undergone restoration			2
the other five are in museums in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity64 , the @entity65 and @entity6			0
rare : the piloted @entity68 rocket is pictured on display in @entity70 in 1945			2
only 150 of them were made progress : the piloted v1 rocket receives some maintenance work at the @entity24 in @entity26 the @entity68 - or @entity75 - is in full working condition , although it obviously does not contain one ton of explosives in the nose as it would have in the war			1
the v1 rocket was the world ’s first cruise missile causing massive loss of life			2
the flying bomb was also known as the @entity68 or @entity68 and was developed at @entity86 by the @entity6 @entity87 during the @entity3			1
they were designed for mass bombing of @entity2 and they were fired from launch sites along the @entity7 and @entity93 coasts			0
the very first @entity68 was fired at @entity2 on june 13 , 1944			0
during their peak , more than 100 a day were lunched towards southeast @entity96			0
in order to try and stop the bombs from hitting targets , the @entity47 forces used guns and fighter aircraft to intercept the bombs			1
the launch sites and underground @entity68 storage depots were also targeted during strategic bombing			0
in total , the bombs caused about 22,892 casualties , almost all of these were civilians			0
@entity112 , the founder of the @entity113 near @entity114 , said : ' after 1945 the @entity115 initially made up part of an enemy aircraft exhibition at @entity70			0
' but because the @entity47 viewed the @entity68 as a munition and not an aircraft it was given to the army ’s bomb disposal unit			1
' we acquired it in 1970 from the army when our museum started up and we had itcosmetically restored then			2
' but we have only been able to pull it out of a hanger when the weather has been okay to display it			0
' in 2000 we began a fundraising project to not only pay for its complete restoration but to also build a new display building for it			2
' we found specialist restorers of wartime fighter planes based in @entity136 and the @entity115 was shipped over there four years ago			0
' since then they have restored it to how it was displayed at @entity70 in 1945			0
' all the instruments in the cockpit were missing when we bought it but the specialists have sourced period instruments that are in working condition			0
' it is now in full working order , although you would never get permission to fly it			0
' the @entity68 and @entity153 flying rockets - or @entity1 ’s vengeance bombs as they were called - killed thousands of people and carried enough explosives to wipe out several buildings			1
restoration : the piloted @entity68 receives some maintenance work in 1970			2
it had recently been sent back to @entity6 to be restored by experts before heading back to the @entity47 suicidal : in a high - risk move , the pilot was meant to bail out of the rocket at the last moment but it was ultimately a suicide mission as the airspeed would have been 550mph but due to their random nature , @entity1 experimented with the idea of getting an airmen to steer them in the direction of a target			1
mr @entity112 said : ' with a pilot you could aim it at a strategic target , like @entity179 , until the last moment when they were meant to bail out			2
' but it was totally kamikaze			0
' the @entity6 dropped the idea in the end , largely because airmen realised it was a suicide mission			0
' also , at the time they were being tested the @entity18 were over-running their launch sites in @entity7 and then @entity8			0
' the rocket is 28ft long , has a wingspan of 22ft and is fitted with an @entity191 109 - 014 pulse jet engine.the museum is due to take delivery of it later this week .			1

150 v1 rockets were fitted with cockpits so they could be steered into targets before pilots attempted to bail out
but travelling at 550mph meant escape would almost be *impossible* and none were used in anger against the @entity47 people in @entity3
now a museum in @entity25 , @entity26 has completed its restoration of a rare example - and although it will never be flown is considered *airworthy*
