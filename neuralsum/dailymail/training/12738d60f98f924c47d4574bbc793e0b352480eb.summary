by @entity0 defense secretary @entity1 said that some of the information that was used to locate and kill @entity4 was attained using torture			2
the admission comes after months of speculation about the role that waterboarding plays in @entity11 interrogations following its graphic depiction in the @entity14 - nominated film @entity15			1
' in order to put the puzzle of intelligence together that led us to @entity4 , there were a lot of pieces out there that were a part of that puzzle			2
yes , some of it came from some of the tactics that were used at that time , interrogation tactics that were used , ’ @entity1 said sunday during an appearance on @entity33			0
' first of all , it ’s a movie , let 's remember that			0
i lived the real story with the @entity4 operation			0
’ this is not the first time that @entity1 , who is portrayed by @entity57 in the controversial film , has admitted that @entity60 investigators were aided by the information gathered using torture			1
even in the months prior to the release of the film in december , many were raising concerns about the graphic torture scene that takes up much of the first fifteen minutes of the movie			1
@entity69 , the head of the @entity70 , says that the interrogation of @entity4 's courier , who then led @entity60 military teams to the @entity77 leader 's compound , did not involve any waterboarding			2
that particular questioning session was key to the case , as @entity60 authorities then trailed the courier who lead them to @entity4 's compound in @entity85 , but @entity69 told @entity86 that waterboarding was not used during the interrogation of the man			2
director @entity40 and screenwriter @entity41 counter her claim without giving any specific details , saying that the film is based fully on first - hand accounts of the years of investigations			1
their response to @entity69 's claims , however , gave a bit more room for creative license			0
' it ’s a movie , not a documentary , ' @entity41 told @entity86			0
cast and crew : @entity104 ( center ) and @entity106 ( left ) stand with stars @entity108 ( center left ) , @entity110 ( center right ) and @entity112 ( right ) at a @entity114 event for the film hints : a trailer for the film shows one agent ( @entity110 ) watching footage of an intrrogation waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the @entity11 in their interrogation of terror suspects			1
the specifics of the tactics differ , but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect 's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head			0
it is thought to simulate drowning , and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die			0
the official stance on it 's use has varied over the years , though the @entity11 has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three @entity77 operatives , including self - proclaimed ' 9/11 mastermind ' @entity144			0
' we ’re trying to make the point that waterboarding and other harsh tactics were part of the @entity11 program			2
' another criticism of the film was that @entity40 and @entity106 ( both of @entity42 fame ) received special treatment by the @entity157 administration during the production stages of the film , but both have denied such claims			1
' it was all based on first hands accounts so it really felt very vivid and very vital and very , very immediate and visceral of course which is very exciting as a film maker , ' @entity40 said without revealing any specific sources			1
for the director , the jarring waterboarding scenes were the most difficult to film			1
‘ i wish that it was n't a part of history , but it is and was , ’ she said			0
