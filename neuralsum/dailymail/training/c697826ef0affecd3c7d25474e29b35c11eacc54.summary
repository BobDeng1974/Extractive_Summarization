@entity6 , 69 , had her fur lined hood of her yellow parka coat up because it was raining heavily outside			1
but when she dashed into @entity11 near her home in @entity13 , @entity14 to buy a packet of porridge , a jobsworth assistant told her to remove the hood for ' safety reasons '			1
@entity6 , pictured , from @entity13 was told to take her hood down in a @entity19 for ' security reasons ' by a jobsworth assistant the store said it had acted after concerns about robberies by yobs who used their hoodies to disguise themselves			1
but mrs @entity6 , a ballroom dancer , said : ' i just could n't believe my ears that i was being treated like some common criminal			1
' it was plain to everyone that i put up my hood in the rain because i did n't want my hair to get wet but this man had only company policy on his mind			2
' i told the man to look at me			0

' a 69 - year - old great - grandmother , pictured , was ordered to take her hood down in a @entity4 store because staff feared she could be a robber mrs @entity6 had popped out for some @entity46 porridge oats for her labourer husband , @entity47 , 60 , who fancied a bowl to warm him up as it was a cold day			1
she said : ' it was pouring down outside so i had my big yellow jacket with a hood and fur on			2
it was a dreadful day and my husband said he really fancied a hot bowl of porridge , so i nipped out to @entity4 to get some			0
' i just decided to walk the 10 minutes to @entity11			1
it was pelting with rain and since i was just bobbing in for one item , i did n't even think about taking my hood down - if i was doing a big shop , then naturally i would have taken it down			2
' but as i was looking around the shelves i heard a voice which said , " excuse me " , he must have said it a couple of times before i realised he was talking to me			0
' but when i turned around , i got the shock of my life when he asked me to remove my hood			1
i asked him what for and he said it was company policy			2
' mrs @entity6 , a retired office clerk who has two grandchildren and a seven - month - old great - granddaughter , and has just battled breast cancer for a third time , added : ' i just walked off			1
i told him i was n't shopping there any more			0
' i only went in for some @entity46 oats and needless to say i came out without them			0
i was so annoyed and angry			0
' i can understand when you go into a bank and people have to remove their helmets but they got this completely wrong			2
' the way i was dressed should have told him i was an older lady			0
' @entity4 says it does not have a company policy on the removing of hoods and helmets but relies on the discretion of managers at individual stores			0
it is understood staff were being cautious after a recent robbery at a nearby @entity98 op. a spokesman said : ' the safety of our colleagues and customers is a priority for @entity4 , which is why in some stores customers are asked to remove their hats and hoods whilst in the store			1
' however , we try to take a commonsense approach to this request , and use discretion in deciding whether to enforce it			0
