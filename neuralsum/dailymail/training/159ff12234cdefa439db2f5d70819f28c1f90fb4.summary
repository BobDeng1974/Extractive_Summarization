@entity0 has become ' quite seductive ' to voters fed up with the coalition , @entity3 has admitted			1
the prime minister said families who have seen their living standards squeezed while immigration rises have faced a ' tough time ' and are attracted to @entity10 's party			0
his comments strike a markedly different tone to previous @entity14 attacks on @entity0 , in the wake of @entity16 becoming the party 's first elected mp			1
but after warning voters they could ' got to bed with @entity10 and wake - up with @entity23 ' , mr @entity3 also ridiculed the @entity0 leader with a mock newspaper front page with his two opponents under the sheets together			1
during the @entity14 party conference , @entity37 accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former chancellor @entity44 said the party 's supporters were ' grumpy old men ' who had led ' disappointing lives '			2
mr @entity3 attacked @entity14 defector @entity48 for betraying the hard work of ordinary @entity14 activists which had got his ' fat arse ' into the @entity52			1
but speaking last night , mr @entity3 admitted the combination of growing @entity54 , high immigration and low wage were fuelling @entity0 's appeal			1
one poll at the weekend put @entity0 on 25 per cent , which in theory would give them 128 mps at the next election			1
mr @entity64 told @entity30 's @entity29 : ' we 've had a very tough time in @entity67			0
people have n't seen pay rises or living standard rises , often for year after year , you 've got @entity73 looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity , immigration has been too high , there 's been a coalition which not everyone has liked			0
' and that 's given the seductiveness of the simple answer that mr @entity10 suggests			0
i think it 's become quite seductive			0
' @entity0 leader @entity10 yesterday celebrated in @entity86 after @entity16 took his seat in the @entity52 , but mr @entity3 warned a vote for @entity0 would help boost @entity33 @entity14 activist @entity89 posing for a selfie with @entity3 as prime minister , you might think he has better things to do			1
but @entity3 has revealed he will always make time for a selfie , because he does not want to disappoint a potential supporter			1
during the @entity14 party conference , mr @entity3 was repeatedly stopped by people wanting to have their picture taken with him			1
mother - of - two @entity100 from @entity102 revealed that the pm was always happy to pose for a picture			2
' he 's one of these types of people , if you stop him , he does n't say no , ' she said			0
mr @entity3 told @entity30 that he had seen the report , and could refuse smiling the for cameras			1
' i read this thing that ' he never says no to a selfie '			0
' it 's quite rude if someone asks you for a selfie and , you know , we politicians are in the business of trying to win people over , to say ' no you ca n't have one '			2
' @entity0 has been boosted by the election of mr @entity16 , who triggered a by - election in his @entity128 seat after defecting from the @entity129 to @entity0 in august			1
he took his seat in the @entity52 yesterday , with mr @entity10 watching from the public gallery			0
the @entity129 are planning to ' throw the kitchen sink ' at the by - election next month in @entity133 and @entity134 , caused by mr @entity48 ' defection			1
today it was announced the by - election will be held on november 20			1
at the 2010 general election , mr @entity48 won the @entity139 seat as a conservative with a majority of 9,953 over @entity33			1
@entity0 did not field a candidate			2
mr @entity3 announced that the @entity14 candidate would be one of two local women - to be chosen by a postal ' primary ' of local voters			1
in a letter to residents , the @entity14 leader said @entity0 wanted to ' turn this election into a national media circus '			1
' we want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area			0
the decision is in your hands			0
there 's no stunts or backroom deals , just a strong local candidate you can trust			0
' the candidates up for selection - in a poll open to voters regardless of which party they support - are local councillors @entity170 and @entity171			2
in his letter , mr @entity3 said ms @entity170 , who runs a marine survey business , ' has seen the strain that excessive immigration has put on housing and our local services ' and would push for action to get it ' under control '			2
fears over the scale of immigration are a significant factor in the surge in popularity that saw @entity0 win may 's @entity73 elections and then secure its first mp and come within a whisker of snatching a safe @entity52 seat in @entity192			2
ms @entity171 , a former barrister , would ' fight for more police on our streets to tackle anti-social behaviour , better health services and a better deal for our armed forces , to whom we own so much ' , mr @entity3 said			2
both candidates would take part in public hustings around the constituency before the selection vote , he said			0
' we 're putting the people of @entity133 and @entity134 in the drivers seat			1
no stunts : just a strong local candidate you can trust			0
' however , the by - election is likely to be held days after the @entity52 votes on signing up to @entity213 rules on policing , including the @entity215			1
it is claimed up to 40 @entity218 could rebel on the plan , fearing it plays into the hands of @entity0			2
mr @entity3 wants to pitch the next election as a direct choice between him and @entity33 leader @entity23			1
polls suggest barely one in five people think mr @entity23 is up to the job of being prime minister			0
mr @entity3 told @entity30 : ' i think the question at the next election is a big one , and i think there is quite a big choice			1
' the difference between what @entity23 wants and what i want is quite profound , and i think we 'll see a big turnout at the next election			0
' @entity14 defector @entity48 is hoping to win his @entity133 and @entity134 seat for @entity0 in the by - election which will take place on november 20 in his speech to the @entity14 party conference , mr @entity3 warned that a vote for @entity0 made it more likely that @entity33 would win the general election			1
he said : ' here 's a thought : on 7th may you could go to bed with @entity10 , and wake up with @entity23			0
i do n't know about you but not one bit of that works for me			0
' he returned to the theme last night , with the mock newspaper front page with an image of mr @entity10 and mr @entity23 in bed			0
the headline ' @entity258 : lastest # @entity259 revealed ' follows the campaign by @entity261 where celebrities have posted pictures online of themselves first thing in the morning , as a @entity265 to the humanitarian crisis in @entity267			0
mr @entity3 joked : : ' we 've had the wake - up selfies with pictures of people that have just woken up - very brave			1
' and i told you that if you go to bed with @entity10 then you could wake up with @entity23 and so i 've got the wake up selfie			0
' meanwhile plans for tv debates ahead of next year 's general election are in chaos , with growing doubts over whether they will take place			0
broadcasters announced mr @entity10 would be given a place in one of three debates , but @entity0 suggested he should be included in more than one and the @entity288 , the @entity289 and respect each demanded a place			2
mr @entity3 said he wanted the proposed tv debates to happen , but raised doubts about the detail of the plans			2
' i would n't have them all in the campaign , they took all the life out of the rest of the campaign , they were the only thing that people were judged on			0
' and the second thing is i think you ca n't have one new party without having another new party			0
and the @entity288 have got an mp , @entity0 have now got an mp , i do n't see how you can have one without the other			2

@entity312 admits @entity0 has *tapped* into concern over low wages and the @entity213
warns that the next election is a straight choice between @entity129 and @entity33
@entity133 and @entity134 by - election to be held on november 20
@entity3 tells voters @entity0 is trying to turn it into a ' media circus '
says it would be ' rude ' to say no to a selfie *...* and could cost him a vote
