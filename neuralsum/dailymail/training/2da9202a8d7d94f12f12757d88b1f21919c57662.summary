spot the difference : police have spent more than £ 50,000 on cardboard cut - outs like this one police have spent more than £ 50,000 on cardboard cut - outs of themselves - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime			1
the two - dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real pcs from a distance			1
but some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised			0
now @entity15 can reveal forces have bought more than 750 of the replicas - at the same time as axing more than 10,000 frontline officers			1
the total was questioned by the @entity20 , which said more cash should be spent on real @entity22 the @entity24 campaign group added : ' this seems to be a gimmick			1
' obtained under the @entity28 , the figures show almost half of @entity31 's police forces have invested in the cut - outs since 2008 , when they first made headlines			1
a total of 21 forces said £ 53,940 had been spent on 782 cardboard cut - outs			1
most were used for crime prevention along with a small number used as promotional materials			0
the cost was borne almost entirely by police , with a small amount in some cases contributed by council - led safety partnerships			2
but there were huge differences in the amount paid by each force - and therefore the value of money to the taxpayer			1
one police force paid 10 times more for each cardboard policeman than another force 200 miles away			1
what 's all this then ? the cardboard pcs are supposed to deter shoplifters - but prove confusing for some @entity61 spent by far the most , splashing out £ 13,260 on just 52 cut - outs at £ 255 each			1
by comparison the average cost of a carboard crime - fighter was a much more modest £ 69 - and @entity66 paid just £ 25 for each of theirs			2
meanwhile , only three of the 21 forces could provide @entity15 with any figures to suggest the cut - outs stop crime			1
alongside local figures , @entity66 cited ' national research ' which claimed cut - outs reduced crime by 35 per cent , but this was not quoted by any other force			1
@entity79 relied on informal feedback which claimed they reduced crime by up to 40 per cent , while @entity83 saw shoplifting drop 8.6 per cent ' as part of a wider campaign '			0
gwent : £ 13,260 for 52 cut - outs ( £ 255 each ) 2			1
@entity89 : £ 11,280 for 112 ( £ 100 each ) 3			2
@entity90 : £ 6,000 for 240 ( £ 25 each ) 4			2
@entity91 : £ 5,330 for 52 cut - outs ( £ 102 each ) 5			2
@entity92 : £ 2,745 for 48 ( £ 57 each ) source : @entity95 requests by @entity15 they were not universally loved , however			0
earlier this year a man who dragged one of the effigies onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of @entity104 was fined £ 90			2
police tracked down the 23 - year - old after the bizarre attack at a @entity109 petrol station in @entity110 , @entity111 , after tracing his car numberplate			1
the incident was embarrassing for @entity105 , which reintroduced the cardboard policemen despite withdrawing a trial of them four years earlier after saying they did not reduce crime			0
campaigners have criticised the cost of the effigies , which were bought amid swingeing cuts to police forces			1
in september 2008 , @entity123 and @entity124 had more than 142,000 officers			0
now there are fewer than 132,000 , a cut of 7.4 per cent			0
frontline numbers are down by almost 11 per cent since their peak in september 2009			0
falling flat : the cut - outs were scrapped in @entity111 ( pictured ) but were then reintroduced - with one being trashed responding to the figures , @entity20 chairman @entity132 said : ' since the 2010 general election , the police service in @entity123 and @entity124 has lost around 16,000 officers and the anticipated reduction in the policing budget in 2015/16 will inevitably lead to a further falls			1
2008 : £ 11,735 2009 : £ 4,556 2010 : £ 4,434 2011 : £ 3,865 2012 : £ 13,875 2013 : £ 7,237 year unknown : £ 8,237,78 ' this drop in officer numbers is having a negative impact on the service that the police can deliver			1
we urge forces to ensure they use all the funds at their disposal to keep officer numbers as high as possible			0
' @entity153 , campaign manager for the @entity24 , added : ' until it 's shown that these actually work , this seems to be a gimmick that will take money away from essential front - line services			2
' the public want the thin blue line to be made of police officers , not cardboard			0
no cut - out , to my knowledge , has ever slapped handcuffs on a criminal			0
' in @entity61 , the cut - outs were bought from the @entity168 in nearby @entity169 between and 2011 and 2013 , and were sent into areas with a high shoplifting rate			0
the high cost was signed off by detective superintendent @entity173 and his successor @entity175 @entity174 insisted the force had sought multiple quotes - but ' the chosen supplier produced a far more robust model being mounted on wood which is still in use '			2
he added : ' we have had considerable success in dealing with shoplifting since the cut outs were introduced			0
on the beat : @entity20 chairman @entity132 said funds should be focused on frontline officers ' we have them deployed at larger stores , and garages throughout the force area			1
levels of shoplifting continue to fall in @entity195			0
the trend began in october 2011 and , compared to our most similar forces , @entity195 experienced the second lowest level of shoplifting per 1000 residents in the past 12 months and we remain committed to using every technique available to prevent this crime			0
' the replicas , which have also been introduced into other force areas , are by no means a replacement for real police officers			1
they are simply another tool in the fight against crime			0
' the replicas will remind potential thieves that real police officers are regularly in and around the shops as part of their normal patrols , and the initiative is another way for police and partners to work together			2
' the @entity219 said it was up to individual forces to decide what they buy			0
national policing lead for procurement @entity224 said : ' there are no national guidelines for the procurement of " cut - outs " of officers			0
this is a matter for each force and will be budgeted for on a force - by - force basis			2
' their use will be determined locally which may include such activities as publicity and recruitment			0

almost half of @entity31 's forces have invested in the replicas since 2008
they are *designed* to deter shoplifters and *drivers* not paying for petrol
gwent police spent £ 13,000 - 10 times more per cutout than another force
but only three forces have *compiled* figures on whether they are *effective*
@entity20 said cash must focus on frontline pcs facing huge cuts
