miss @entity11 , a single mother of a nine - year - old son , agreed to be interviewed for free to tell her side of the story			1

' the 24 - year - old said there was one ' crazy guy ' who would jump up on the bar			2
she also said that the way the men approached her and her friends gave the impression that they had done it before			2

seedy : the @entity5 agent allegedly took miss @entity11 to his room in @entity29 's @entity28 after agreeing to pay her $ 800 for sex one man , identified as @entity78 , allegedly agreed on a price of $ 800 to have sex with miss @entity11			1

they are still looking to talk to the remaining three women			0

in an interview last week , miss @entity11 said she never would have complained about not being paid had she known the agent was in the @entity168			1
