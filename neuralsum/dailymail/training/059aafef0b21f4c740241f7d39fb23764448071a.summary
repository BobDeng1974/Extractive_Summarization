by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:18 est , 25 february 2014 @entity6 during her time with the @entity5 before she switched to broadcasting an ex-nfl cheerleader - turned - sports journalist almost became a victim of human sex trafficking at the @entity11 when she was recruited for a reporting job that turned out to be bogus			1
@entity6 from @entity13 , @entity14 , was approached by a talent agent hiring @entity17 reporters to cover the @entity18 last september			1
writing on @entity19 , she explained how she became suspicious when - after a lengthy application process - the ' agent ' asked her if she had any ' girlfriends ' she could take with her , offering them visas with no interview process , eventually prompting action from the @entity26			2
ms @entity6 was contacted in september 2013 via her website by a man claiming to be a talent acquisition agent			1
' given my background in sports broadcasting ... and working on sports talk radio , it made sense he was recruiting me , ' she wrote			0
ms @entity6 was asked to submit examples of her work , and audition several times , before she was told that she had got the job with the network as a host and beat reporter for the games			2
in addition to ms @entity6 , she was told that another legitimate sportscaster in @entity14 was hired to work alongside her			2
her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was set to leave for @entity48 , when the ' talent agent ' said he needed to expand the coverage team and asked if she had any ' girlfriends ' in the industry she could recommend			1
his assistant , who was actually just him , sent her documents for her friend to get a work visa			0
@entity6 said her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was due to leave for @entity48 , when the ' agent ' said he needed to expan the coverage team and asked if she had any ' girlfriends ' she could recomment ms @entity6 says that so many of the trafficking stories she has heard started with someone being told they were hired for a modelling job ms @entity6 said : ' i spent four months applying and interviewing and he 's sending my friend a work visa without even seeing her work ? ' now , my friend is really talented , but wanting her passport and social security number before her reel ( reporting and presenting clips ) just seemed fishy to me			1
' ms @entity6 contacted the other sportscaster who was supposed to be going to @entity48 with her and they investigated the talent agency further			1
she said : ' she and i concocted a plan to contact the production company in @entity80 directly to check his credentials without stepping on his toes in the event we were just being paranoid			2
' upon their investigation it turned out that the production company did n't know who he was , and advised them not to travel to @entity91 , and instead contact lawyers , who eventually contacted the @entity26 targeted by sex traffickers : ms @entity6 said the man exerted a lot of effort to pose as legitimate and posed as a ' devout family man '			1
on the day she was supposed to leave , she was negotiating with her lawyers ms @entity6 remarked how she was shocked at the amount of effort the ' talent agent ' had put in to the scheme			1
she said : ' the man exerted as much effort as a full time job to pose as legitimate - and never once crossed the line			0
' rather , he posed as a devout family man - we got the results back and suddenly needed the @entity26 ' on the day that she was set to leave , bags packed and flights booked , @entity110 was instead negotiating with her lawyers and the @entity26 , as it turned out that the ' talent acquisition agency ' was most likely a front for a sex trafficking ring			1
the @entity117 - including the winter games at @entity48 - are a huge draw for trafficking : aid workers said @entity17 women are typically sold for more in foreign countries according to @entity124 , founder of the non-profit all we want is @entity127 , a charity that attempts to help victims of human trafficking , it is common for men to pose as talent agents in order to lure and traffic women			2
ms @entity6 said : ' so many of the stories i 've heard from survivors start with " i was hired for a modelling job "			0
' @entity124 told her : ' the @entity18 is a huge draw for trafficking			0
' it 's a major sporting event in a foreign country , and @entity17 women are typically sold for more in foreign countries			0
' ms @entity6 added : ' either way , this was n't going to end well			0
' unfortunately i am not the daughter of @entity149 , so i would n't have had a happy ending had i gotten on a plane			0
' for any young girl wanting to get into the business the first step is to seek a credible agent			0
' if you have to pay money for an audition , that 's a red flag for a business scam			0
