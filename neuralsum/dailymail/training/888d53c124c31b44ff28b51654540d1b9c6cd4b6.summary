and it seems supermarkets are responding to the news accordingly as the first ever reduced - salt mild cheddar cheese launches in the @entity17 today			1
the ground - breaking cheese , which will go on sale exclusively at more than 600 @entity21 stores , will offer health - conscious @entity17 shoppers a cheddar with a 30 per cent reduction of salt			1

@entity21 cheese category buying manager @entity56 said : ' cheddar is the most consumed cheese in @entity17 with plenty of different varieties to suit a wide range of tastes - from mild to extra strong and even those that can reduce your cholesterol			1
' there are also several different fat - reduced cheddars available , but now shoppers across the @entity17 will have easy access to a reduced - salt variety for the first time			2
' this cheese has been developed over several years by one of the @entity17 's top dairy producers and we believe it stands up well against regular mild cheddars			1
we also think it will inspire other cheese makers to follow suit			0
100g of cheese can contain 1.5g to 3.5g of salt			0
50g/2oz cheddar - a piece the size of a small matchbox or the amount you 'd get in a cheese sandwich - contains 0.8g salt			2

the cheese has been made for @entity21 by award - winning dairy producers @entity102 , who have become well known for their ground - breaking work within the reduced fat cheese market			1

a single portion of regular cheddar has more salt than a bag of crisps
ground - breaking mild cheese boasts a 30 per cent salt reduction
@entity4 could n't spot cheese 's reduced saltiness **...**
