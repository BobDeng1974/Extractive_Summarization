by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 05:29 est , 18 september 2013 workers at a @entity3 seafood plant have been accused of killing lobsters and crabs in a ' primitive and painful ' manner , according to an animal rights group that filmed procedures at the plant			1
footage allegedly taken at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 showed workers pulling the bodies of lobsters apart while they were still alive and conscious , and rubbing away the organs of alive crabs			1
animal rights group @entity18 filmed during a five - month investigation into slaughter methods at the seafood processing plant			1
the group said @entity11 's should be using humane technology to stun or kill the crustaceans immediately , instead of subjecting them to cruel and prolonged deaths			1
allegations : @entity11 's lobster plant is accused of using cruel methods footage of the lobster processing showed the animals ' bodies being pulled apart , with workers acknowledging that they remained alive for a couple of hours afterwards			1
a factory worker was also filmed jumping on a container filled with live lobsters			0
with the crabs , after their shells were removed they were held , still alive , against bristles that rub away their exposed organs			0
one of the workers said the crabs stay alive until they are dropped into boiling water later on in the process			0
@entity18 said it edited out features that could identify the plant because it was trying to work with the owners to find a more humane way to kill the crustaceans			2
mr @entity39 told the @entity76 the animal rights group was confident that the footage was authentic and accurate			1
an attorney for @entity11 's said however , he could not comment because it was not clear where the footage was taken			1
@entity18 plans to file a criminal complaint against the plant today with police and the district attorney			1
@entity3 law bans intentionally killing animals with a method that does n't kill them outright			0
lobsters and crabs are not exempt from the law			0
shocking : @entity18 says it filmed a plant worker jumping up and down on a container filled with lobsters @entity18 plans to file a criminal complaint against the plant today with police and the district attorney			1
in some states lobsters and crabs are not covered by the laws because of widely held beliefs that their simple nervous systems make them immune to pain			0
alive : live crabs are held against a rotating brush which removes their organs end of the line : the crabs are still alive when they are dropped into a vat of boiling water however , recent research by @entity115 showed that crabs would avoid using a shelter where they had previously received an electric shock			0
@entity120 , who carried out the research , said the crab behavior in the @entity18 footage was ' consistent with that of animal feeling pain '			2
dr @entity126 , from the @entity127 , also viewed the video of the @entity3 plant 's killing method			0
' this is carving the animal alive and would no doubt cause unnecessary pain , ' he said			0
@entity18 said the plant should use a device called @entity136 , which stuns the animals ' nervous system and kills them almost instantaneously			2
debate : scientists disagree as to whether lobsters can feel pain but recent research appears to prove they do ' there 's no excuse for the blatant and , we would argue illegal , cruelty going on at this slaughterhouse when there are alternate slaughter methods that rapidly stun and kill these animals , ' mr @entity39 said			2
the @entity11 plant is a big company in @entity3 's $ 300 million lobster business			2
in a report earlier this year , the plant 's five stations were expected to buy 7 million lb of seafood this year			0
