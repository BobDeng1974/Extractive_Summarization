by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 1 april 2013 the controversial @entity2 hotline service will go live in only one area of @entity4 tomorrow after grave concerns were voiced about its safety			1
the advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for @entity9 - with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on whether they should visit their gp or attend a hospital			1
already in operation in 22 @entity2 regions , 111 is due to ‘ go live ’ across the @entity18 and @entity20 area tomorrow , and in a further 13 areas over the coming month			1
the initial plan had been to roll it out nationwide today , but doctors had repeatedly warned lives could be at risk			1
delayed : the new nhs 111 hotline service will go live in only one area of @entity4 tomorrow after grave concerns were voiced about its safety last week the @entity29 wrote to the head of the @entity2 , sir @entity31 , urging him to delay the full national roll - out of the 111 service			1
dr @entity34 , chairman of the @entity29 ’s @entity35 , said : ‘ we can not sacrifice patient safety to meet a political deadline			1
’ a cornerstone of the @entity29 's argument is that those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all , and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms			0
they may then be referred to speak on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary			2
last night a spokesman for @entity4 , the body managing the @entity2 service ’s introduction , said : ‘ this is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe , high quality service that patients and the public can trust			0
‘ many sites are already up and running , but in areas where @entity2 is not yet available we will make a thorough assessment of readiness before new sites are introduced			2
‘ the public can be assured the areas that already have @entity2 will continue this service			2
in those areas where @entity2 is not yet in place they can ring @entity9 on 0845 46 47			1
all gp surgeries also have messages advising what to do			0
’ the initial plan had been to roll the service out nationwide today , but doctors had repeatedly warned lives could be at risk @entity9 was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning up in @entity86			1
the idea is the new service combines the long - running @entity9 helpline with local emergency out - of - hours services			1
@entity2 bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out - of - hours telephone services for gp surgeries will make it easier for patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends			0
they will be put through to a call centre worker who will decide if they need to go to @entity86 , a @entity14 clinic , a chemist or can get by with over-the - phone advice			2
the operator can potentially send out an ambulance , put someone straight through to a nurse , book an out - of - hours gp appointment , or direct the caller to a pharmacist or dentist			0
in some areas of the country the new service will be run by private firms while in others it will be overseen by @entity2 ambulance services			2
but the @entity29 has also warned that the service is being ‘ run on the cheap ’ with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses			0
mess : fears about the state of the service in trial areas have been reported , with some people kept waiting for hours staff have been recruited for as little as £ 8 per hour to man the phone lines			0
job adverts suggest they require no medical experience but should have telesales experience and typing skills			0
while nurses represented around 36 per cent of staff at @entity9 , they only comprise around 17 per cent of the @entity2 workforce			1
as well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed , there have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with hiccups			0
some patients using limited 111 pilot schemes are already waiting several hours for urgent medical advice , while others have been told to phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk to them .			0
