by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 will complete the loan signing of @entity5 striker @entity4 early next week but manager @entity6 has concerns at the other end of the pitch			1
the @entity10 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity11 in @entity12 on saturday as an inept first - half defensive display allowed the @entity15 side to race into a three - goal lead			1
@entity6 took responsibility for the loss – blaming himself for naming a young team – but his back four was made up of skipper @entity21 , the experienced @entity22 , @entity23 – a £ 6.7million signing – and highly - rated left - back @entity25			1
shaky : @entity2 captain @entity21 was poor during their disappointing defeat to @entity11 celebrate : @entity28 , right , is congratulated by @entity29 after scoring @entity11 's opening goal judgement day : @entity2 goalkeeper @entity32 and midfielder @entity33 look at one another during loss and the @entity2 boss said : ' i take full responsibility for that first half			1
it was perhaps a bit too young , so i blame myself for that defeat			0
' i put two young lads up the top and maybe it was too much inexperience to cope with a team like @entity11			0
' it was @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and ( @entity53 ) @entity52 's first game so really i 'm kicking myself because i should have had a bit more experience on			0
' problems at the back : @entity2 boss @entity6 admitted his side lacked enough experience for the game @entity61 blasted the opener from distance on 25 minutes before 19 - year - old @entity64 helped himself to a double , the first an unmarked volley from eight yards and the second a stunner from the angle of the area			2
@entity69 fired a consolation but the former @entity72 winger has already been told he can leave the club			0
one player definitely coming in is @entity4 , the 23 - year - old @entity75 who will join on a season - long loan having refused to return to @entity77 amid the political unrest and violence in the country			0
due to sign : @entity5 striker @entity4 , right , is poised to complete a loan move in the coming days summer signing @entity83 , meanwhile , watched from the stands at the @entity86 and the @entity87 international will not feature when @entity2 conclude their @entity90 campaign against the hosts on sunday afternoon .			2

@entity2 boss said he should have fielded a *stronger* team from the start
despite labelling his line - up ' too young ' , the @entity10 boss fielded experienced defensive *pairing* @entity22 and @entity21
@entity101 side *stormed* into a three - goal lead in @entity12
@entity2 were poor at the back throughout the match in @entity106
they are set to boost *attacking* ranks with loan signing @entity4
