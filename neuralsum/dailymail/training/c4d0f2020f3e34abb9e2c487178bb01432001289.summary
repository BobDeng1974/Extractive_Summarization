@entity0 will go into the @entity2 @entity1 with his future as uncertain as at any time in his distinguished 15 - year career			2
@entity0 , 34 , is out of contract at @entity7 at the end of the season and the team are waiting to see how the driver market shakes up before deciding whether to offer the 2009 world champion a new deal			1
@entity14 understands that @entity15 of @entity16 is top of @entity7 ’s short list , with @entity19 a maverick possibility to return to the team that nurtured his talent			1
@entity36 said after last sunday ’s @entity37 that they were ‘ not looking to finalise our driver line - up now ’ — hardly a ringing endorsement of @entity0			2
much depends on whether @entity15 is ready to join @entity7 at the start of their engine partnership with @entity43 , which begins for next season , or would rather see out the final year of his @entity16 contract before committing			1
it is understood @entity7 would have no reluctance in signing @entity15 despite the acrimonious year they spent together in 2007			2
top target : @entity15 is on @entity7 's wish list their less favoured option is @entity19 , although he would only leave @entity53 if he loses out on the title to his team - mate @entity55			1
even if @entity15 or @entity19 joined , @entity0 could yet be preferred to @entity7 ’s other driver , rookie @entity56			1
@entity0 is certainly confident the @entity2 @entity1 on july 6 will not be his last			0
alternative : @entity19 is an option for @entity7 ‘ not as far as i know , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t know why @entity7 would n’t take me for next year			0
the delay is just the way it is for a big team			0
we will leave it to the last moment to make a decision			0
’ @entity0 is popular with the team and sponsors , as well as being experienced and reliable			0
‘ it ’s not necessary to talk about contracts right now because they ’ve got other things to focus on , like making the car quicker , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 's contract at @entity7 expires at the end of the campaign
@entity7 will wait to see how the market shapes up before making an offer
@entity15 is top target while @entity19 is a less favourable option
