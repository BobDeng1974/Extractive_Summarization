by @entity1 reporter published : 21:16 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 6 june 2013 police minister @entity2 has said cultural and religious differences are no defence for men from ethnic minorities linked to sex crimes against young girls cultural and religious differences can not be used as a defence for men from ethnic minorities linked to sex crimes against young girls , @entity9 @entity2 has insisted			1
the police minister said he was not prepared to accept mitigation that some child abuse would be regarded as acceptable in other parts of the world			1
a new taskforce led by mr @entity2 to tackle organised grooming and child sex exploitation is considering a number of measures , including giving defence barristers special training in how to deal with young witnesses			1
it comes after high - profile court cases in @entity29 and @entity30 , involving mainly @entity32 men targeting white girls			1
nine @entity32 men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years last may for offences which happened in and around @entity29 in 2008 and 2009			2
five girls , aged between 13 and 15 , were given alcohol , food and money in return for sex but there were times when violence was used			0
last month a paedophile ring was found guilty of a catalogue of charges involving vulnerable underage girls who were groomed for sexual exploitation in the @entity30 area			1
' we have turned over a stone and discovered that for a number of years , in the case of organised grooming , horrible and profoundly unacceptable things have been happening in a number of places in this country and large parts of the public sector have got to get better at dealing with them , ' mr @entity2 told @entity64			1
' the age of consent may be puberty in other parts of the world , but it is not in this country			0
and in this country it is not acceptable to regard anyone else as being in some way less than human because they may not share your religious views or your race			0
' we are all equal under the law			0
if you are abusing children sexually then that 's criminality and i am not prepared to accept , as a plea in mitigation , the argument that in some parts of the world this would be regarded as acceptable			1
it 's not acceptable in @entity90 in 2013			0
' he added : ' if you come and live in 21st - century @entity90 then you obey the laws and observe the conventions of 21st - century @entity90			0
and the law says that exploiting children for sexual purposes is a serious and disgusting crime			0
' @entity98 ( left ) and @entity99 ( right ) were among seven members of a paedophile ring in @entity30 convicted of offences involving underage girls leading @entity105 groups , including the @entity106 , has condemned those involved in such crimes , @entity64 has reported , adding the majority of @entity90 @entity109 felt revulsion for such actions			2
mr @entity2 said the @entity112 and the vulnerable task force was treating organised grooming as a priority , although it would address all forms of child sexual abuse			1
new guidance is also due to be published next week aimed at improving the response of the @entity120 and police forces to suspected cases of abuse			0
