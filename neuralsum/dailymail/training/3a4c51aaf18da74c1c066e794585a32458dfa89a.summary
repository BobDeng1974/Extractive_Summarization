like many clubs who call themselves ' the @entity2 ' - including @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity6 - @entity5 fly a bird of prey around their stadium before games			1
it 's a tradition at the club that features at half - time of every home game played at the @entity14			0
however , the @entity16 side have now taken the spectacle a step further by attaching a @entity20 camera to their resident eagle named @entity22 to give a stunning bird 's eye view of their stadium before a game against @entity26 ( who thankfully did not release their own animal )			2
watch your heads ! the eagle takes off surprisingly close to fans at the rear of the stadium @entity35 : the camera fitted to the mascot 's underside gives stunning footage of the stadium spectacle : the eagle mascot completes a couple of loops in the air to impress @entity5 fans touchdown ! the bird of prey eventually lands on its trainer 's arm at the centre of the pitch the eagle soars astonishingly close to supporters heads after taking off from the rear of the stands and performing a couple of loops before landing on its trainer 's arm at the centre of the pitch			0
unfortunately for @entity5 , @entity22 did not bring them any luck as the @entity26 inflicted a first loss on the home team in this season 's @entity64 with a 1 - 0 victory			1
@entity3 also have an live mascot , a bald named @entity69 , who flies around @entity71 before most home games - although it was once berated by @entity74 fans for being ' just a pigeon ' @entity76 has landed : @entity3 fly a bald eagle called @entity69 before games at @entity71 let it begin : @entity4 are another club who start home games with the ritual flying of a bird of prey			0
