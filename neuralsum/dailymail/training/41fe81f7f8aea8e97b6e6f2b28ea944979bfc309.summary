in this latest of @entity2 's reviews of the candidates for @entity4 's @entity6 award for 2014 , @entity0 looks at @entity7 's played in @entity8			1
putting it quite simply , this is a remarkable book			2
you do n't have to be a @entity8 to enjoy played in @entity8 , though that would help			1
you do n't even have to like sport , though if you do it will add to your enjoyment considerably			0
more than anything else , this is just a fascinating education			0
author @entity7 has impressive form when it comes to presenting the history of sport , going back to his days of writing about the football grounds of @entity22 in the 1980s			1
@entity23 - seen here during the 1932 fa cup final between @entity26 and newcastle - features in @entity7 's ' played in @entity8 '			1
it is possibly the capital 's most famous sporting venue this latest effort - in the running to be @entity33 - is part of a ' played in @entity22 ' season , and is extraordinary in both its scope and levels of research			1
one of the beauties of this book is that you can become engrossed in certain sections and then put it down for a couple of days , before returning to enjoy more			2
it 's a frame of reference , a treasure trove of information			2
time and time again , i found myself amazed by the sheer level of detail in this book			2
but i suspect that , for @entity7 , this is very much a labour of love			1
the book takes us back many centuries , to sports such as cock - fighting and bull - baiting , and also tells us the tale of many of our favourite sports of today			0
all the major sports have their own chapter – football fans will love the stories behind their favourite @entity8 club , rugby fans will relish the guide to the capital 's many famous grounds			1
i 'm particularly interested in the history of @entity8 's swimming pools , both outdoors and indoors , and found those sections provided an invaluable insight into the past			1
most of us have heard about some of these places , like @entity80 or @entity81 , or perhaps even visited them , but how many of us know anything about their history , their heritage ? @entity87 in south @entity8 - seen here in this 1996 picture - is one of many outdoor and indoor swimming pools to be featured in the book there 's that word - heritage			1
@entity7 comes back to it time and time again			1
the author ca n't disguise the fact that he 's a sporting romantic			1
he knows the value of sport in our lives			0
and he knows its importance in the story of the capital			0
@entity7 tells us right at the start that no city on earth has such a rich sporting heritage			1
the front cover of @entity110 in @entity8 in most ways , @entity8 could never escape its incredible past - it 's there in its churches , its parks , its stations			1
and it 's very much there in its sport too			0
the author is clearly anxious that we continue to preserve it as much as we can			0
the disappointment comes through the pages when @entity7 writes of a club being disbanded , or a pool shutting down			2
as you would expect , some of the most fabled sporting venues in the world feature heavily in the book , such as @entity23 , @entity129 and @entity130			2
many lesser known arenas are here too , some of them sadly gone , like @entity134 and @entity135			0
there are guides to grandstands , greyhound tracks , bowling greens and billiard halls			0
in every sense , this guide is an extensive and exhaustive one			0
the book is visually delightful too ; i 'm pretty certain most readers will never have seen many of the wonderful pictures on show			0
they help to provide a quite magical snapshot into @entity8 's past , and sometimes present too			1
this really is a splendid effort , which helps to tell us part of the long story of the capital , and i 'm certain it will still have relevance a century from now			0
@entity7 and @entity160 , should be proud of themselves			2
this book not only feels special , it feels vital too			0
look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week .			0
