many thought @entity0 would rest on their @entity3 laurels this summer having just won the @entity3 but instead they added three big - name signings to their squad			1
@entity6 was one of the pass - masters of the @entity8 and ended up with a winner 's medal ; @entity11 scored the tournament 's best goal , and quite possibly its second best goal too ; and in a tournament full of good goalkeeping performances @entity15 was the pick of the bunch			1
no - one at @entity0 doubts his ability to play the position in the @entity42 league – the test will come when the opponent is of a slightly higher quality			2
@entity37 gave @entity6 time to pick his passes at the weekend and he took full advantage , none more so than when his long pass forward set up @entity11 's goal			1
the other doubt is whether it is the best use of @entity6 ' talents			2
at @entity25 , @entity53 used him in that position when he turned up but soon decided that he preferred him further forward and turned @entity55 into his midfield holder			0
there are times when @entity6 , not unlike @entity59 for @entity60 , ca n't resist a natural tendency to carry the ball forward as opposed to give the quick pass most teams want from their sitting midfielder			1
@entity6 is becoming a sturdy constant in the middle of the mark but still has attacking tendencies @entity70 forward @entity11 knocks a ball beyond @entity37 's @entity72 during saturday 's 5 - 0 win @entity0 do have @entity74 and @entity75 who can play in the middle of the midfield three and that would certainly release @entity6 , but @entity21 said in midweek : ' i am sure @entity6 can play in @entity81 's position ' so for the time being he looks set to continue there			1
on saturday he faces any holding midfielder 's biggest test with @entity86 wandering back from his centre forward starting point to play in the space in front of @entity0 's back four			1
we learn a lot about @entity6 during those 90 minutes			2
@entity11 has certainly done his job off the pitch			2
if @entity0 wanted a new pin - up boy then they have hit the jackpot as their £ 63million star has female fans swooning in the aisles at the @entity20 as well as in the aisles of the club 's superstore next to the stadium where his shirt sales have put him behind only @entity106 in terms of popularity			2
on the pitch he has shown the flashes of brilliance that he displayed at the @entity8 and that ultimately convinced president @entity112 that it would make excellent business sense to move on @entity115 ( who was now , with some justification , asking to be moved up the club 's wage structure ) and bring in someone who would accept his salary and , in effect , be paid for by the @entity123 's big money switch to @entity124			1
all that was left to do was to make it work on the pitch			0
goalkeeper @entity15 has seen his opportunities to play limited thanks to @entity130 @entity11 has had to do more running back than he would have liked			1
but he has done it without complaint and there are signs that it now comes a little easier to him than it did in the first few games			0
he still ca n't give those long - busting road - runner performances that @entity139 gave , so @entity21 has instructed @entity140 to track back to make a bank of four when @entity0 do n't have the ball			1
when @entity140 did n't play on saturday and @entity0 lined up with @entity6 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity11 in midfield the @entity145 had greater licence to get forward and gave one of his best performances of the season so far			1
@entity15 hit the jackpot this summer when a wonderful @entity8 topped off a stunning season and earned him a move to @entity0			1
a devout @entity154 , @entity0 television captured images of him reading from his bible in the car to the stadium as he turned up for his medical and presentation			2
at the moment , however , the man they called @entity130 ( @entity161 ) stands between @entity162 and complete nirvana			0
the captain is clinging on to his first team spot and has looked in excellent domestic form this season - limiting @entity162 to just one @entity28 opportunity			0
@entity15 made three saves and conceded one goal in a 5 - 1 win against @entity171			0
most of the action was down the other end of the pitch and when he was tested there was not chance to do anything out of the ordinary			0
life for a keeper at @entity0 can be tough with so little to gain and so much to lose in so many of the games			0
he will be @entity0 's @entity183 keeper with a last - 16 tie against @entity185 on december 3 - his first match in the domestic cup competition			0
that will give him the chance to win a trophy and to start pushing @entity130 , who it seems he will probably replace as no 1 in all competitions at the start of next season			0
barring any @entity195 vs @entity197 lapses for @entity130 in a @entity0 shirt though , he will have to be patient			0
video real ready for tough week - @entity21			0

@entity21 opted to sell @entity115 to @entity200 for £ *60m*
@entity0 signed @entity11 after an *impressive* @entity8
the @entity3 winners also landed @entity204 midfielder @entity6
goalkeeper @entity15 has seen opportunities limited so far this year
