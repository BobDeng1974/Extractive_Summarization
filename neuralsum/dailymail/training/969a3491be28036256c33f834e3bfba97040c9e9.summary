a mysterious circle on a grainy scan , this is what scientists are claiming is finally evidence that @entity6 has been visited by aliens			1
researchers have claimed the fuzzy outline is a flying saucer that ended up 300ft down on the ocean floor between @entity12 and @entity13			1
they were stunned when sonar scans taken while searching for a century - old wreck showed up the shape against the dirt			1
lead researcher @entity26 also suggested that another explanation could be that it was ' a new @entity28 '			1
the ' discovery ' has sparked a flurry of speculation by @entity19 watchers and bloggers			1
some have even suggested it resembles the @entity36 from the @entity38 series , with its distinctive front forks and round shape			2
newspapers in @entity12 have put the story on their front pages and asked if this is really the first sign of extra-terrestrial life			1
the shape was found at the bottom of the @entity48 during a search for a sunken wreck which contained several cases of champagne			2

if it does turn out to be a ufo it will be priceless , but if it is just a shape , it will be worthless			0
such claims have been made many times in the past , the most famous of which was the ' @entity82 ' , a rock formation in the @entity84 which looked like a road			0
located 55miles east of @entity87 in @entity88 , the formation has been linked to the lost city of @entity90 although geologists have said it was naturally formed			0
experts have also pointed out that even the idea of a flying saucer as a round object might be wrong - the first sighting of such a craft later turned out to be a reporting error			1
some enthusiasts have compared the shape to the @entity36 from the @entity38 series , with its distinctive front forks and round shape			0
