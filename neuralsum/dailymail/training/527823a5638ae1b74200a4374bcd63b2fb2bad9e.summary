even though i had four beautiful children , i was only 30 years old and i felt i was quite young to be getting a hysterectomy			2
i had n’t ruled out the possibility of having more children in the future			2
' breakfast : toast lunch : ham sandwiches dinner : large portion of pasta snacks : numerous bars of chocolate breakfast : @entity83 lunch : a tuna salad dinner : grilled chicken and fresh vegetables snacks : none a year later , her weight having reached its maximum of 22st and wearing size 26 clothing , mrs @entity4 decided to ask her doctor about whether she could have bariatric surgery on the @entity21			1
she said : ' i felt i had no options left			0
