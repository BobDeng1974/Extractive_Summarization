the @entity8 said it feared the species had already , or was about to , spread to @entity7 during its peak season of september			1
@entity8 said the @entity5 hornet – latin name @entity12 – was ‘ invasive and predatory ’ and attacked honey bee colonies			1
a statement said : ' it has spread very quickly to many areas of @entity17 where it is reported to be causing many problems for both beekeepers and biodiversity in the country			1
the hornet can predate on bee colonies , causing significant harm			0
@entity5 hornets were first recorded in @entity41 , south - west @entity17 , in 2005 , after arriving in a pottery shipment from @entity43			1
they spread across @entity17 but until now were blocked from coming to the @entity45 by the @entity6			2
@entity8 is asking @entity7 beekeepers to be on the lookout for the @entity5 hornet , which is smaller than our own native @entity50 hornet , @entity49			1
predatory : the @entity5 hornet is known to attack bee colonies ' to protect bees from invasive threats it is important for all beekeepers in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 to sign up to @entity62 , ' a statement from @entity8 said			1
it has asked anyone who thinks they have seen an @entity5 hornet to notify the @entity68 alert at the email address alert_nonnative@ceh.ac.uk immediately			0

' monitoring for their arrival in @entity7 is strongly encouraged throughout the @entity45 , but especially in areas where likelihood of arrival is considered to be highest , the south and south - east of @entity59 , ' @entity8 said			0
' beekeepers and other members of the public should consider hanging hornet traps but remember that it is very important that damage to native wasps , hornets and any other insects is kept to an absolute minimum			0
information from beekeepers in @entity17 , who are having to control hornet numbers , show that in areas where traps are deployed in springtime , nest numbers are reduced by up to 90 per cent			2
' in the event that @entity5 hornets become established here , springtime trapping will thus be a very useful management tool			0
