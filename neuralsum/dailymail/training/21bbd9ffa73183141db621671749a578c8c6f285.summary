by @entity0 @entity3 's canal network is at risk of being ravaged by the government ’s controversial high speed 2 rail line , campaigners warned yesterday			1
the campaign to @entity8 ( @entity9 ) says the tranquillity of some of @entity3 ’s most idyllic waterways – and canal boat holidays enjoyed by thousands of people each year – will be destroyed by train noise and ugly concrete viaducts built as part of the project			1
the group has identified more than a dozen historic canals threatened by the building of the @entity23 rail line from @entity24 to @entity25 and the proposed extension to @entity27 and @entity28			2
ugly and noisy : what @entity23 might look like crossing a peaceful canal in the @entity3 countryside , speeding past and creating a cacophony in the once peaceful canal network mock - ups of prospective designs for the @entity23 trains , which have been widely protested inside and outside of @entity24 these include picturesque @entity39 , where the @entity40 and @entity41 meet , and neglected waterways such as the @entity43 and @entity44 , which features in the film @entity46			1
the @entity9 has called on the government to move the line away from the canals in its response to the consultation on the proposed @entity25 to @entity27 section , which closed on friday			0
a spokesman said : ‘ nowhere in the consultation material have they considered the combined impact of all of @entity23 ’s route on the canal network			1
the @entity9 is calling for the route to be changed so it does not get in the way of canals and , where it crosses them , for viaducts to be designed so they fit in with the local scenery			0
’ @entity66 , campaigns manager at the @entity67 , said : ‘ these trains are very noisy – between 90 and 100 decibels			2
where the rail lines have to cross a canal , @entity23 needs to get better at reducing the noise			1
’ stop @entity23 protest signs in @entity73 , @entity74			0
support for the protests comes from across @entity3 , with many residents of towns that the @entity23 lines will either cut through or go near voicing their concern a protestor wearing a mask depicting prime minister @entity83 demonstrates against the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) rail line at @entity85 on november 25 , 2013 in @entity24			1
@entity86 has had a large amount of anger towards the prospective high speed train , as it may carve up land both around and below houses there are major concerns about the waterways at @entity39 , @entity95 , a conservation area and tourist hotspot			0
the owner of the local @entity99 pub , @entity100 , 51 , said : ‘ @entity23 will be cutting across the canal and taking this beautiful and highly photographed landmark away from us			2
i see @entity23 as a big threat			0
’ but in @entity43 , where the local canal has been derelict for years , @entity105 , managing director of narrowboat company @entity106 , said : ‘ the new rail link can only have a good effect			0
it will bring much - needed prosperity			0
’ @entity112 , spokesman for @entity23 , said : ‘ building a railway that will create thousands of jobs and free up capacity on the country ’s rail network is a challenging business , so it is vital we maintain meaningful dialogue with all parties around @entity23			0
it is inevitable that @entity23 will cross over a number of waterways along the line of the route			2
‘ the plans set out in the @entity129 accommodate extensive environmental mitigation and are the results of the largest public consultation and engagement scheme ever undertaken in the @entity3			1
people have until 27 february to submit their views on the environmental statement			0
’ the intricate system of canals in @entity3 would be crisscrossed by the @entity23 network , which people are arguing would be a terrific eyesore to the countryside			1

@entity23 is set to travel through several major @entity3 towns , such as @entity146
the scheme has *sparked* fears for *ancient* waterways in @entity3 countryside
trains are *incredibly* noisy , *sparking* fears for canal *wildlife*
