by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 1 november 2013 to commemorate the first twin giant panda cubs to be born in the @entity2 and survive , a time - lapse video has been released showing their first 100 days in three minutes			1
the adorable video featuring @entity8 and @entity9 , baby giant pandas born at @entity6 in july , has already been viewed almost 200,000 times			1
over the course of 100 days , the baby boys develop from blind , pink , toothless creatures measuring about six to seven inches long and to robust , curious cubs with thick black and white fur			1
the names , @entity8 and @entity9 , come from ancient @entity35 idioms meaning ' something indescribably beautiful and magnificent			2
' @entity6 documented their development by filming them with their ' @entity43 ' 24 hours a day			1
giant panda cubs are about 900 times smaller than their mothers when they are born looking after them is extremely time - consuming for the mother			1
the cubs appear to spend much of their time sleeping , but as they develop their eyes are open more and they begin moving around their enclosure			0
@entity52 generally begin crawling at about 75 to 80 days old			0
almost one month : the pandas have very soft , sparse fur when they are babies but will eventually grow thick , coarse fur miniature giants : by day 36 the pandas are beginning to look like tiny versions of the adults they will be first sight : both cubs opened their eyes and began using their back legs to scoot themselves around their enclosure at about this time according to zookeeper @entity68 , the cubs are now trying to stand			2
' both cubs are getting really good at standing ... their movements are still pretty clumsy , and sometimes when they try to walk they appear to be making frog - like or inchworm - like movements all around the nest box , ' she wrote on the @entity6 panda blog			2
@entity6 staff told @entity78 viewers that , typically , the twins would not have survived in the wild			0
in the comments section of the video , @entity6 said that in the wild , giant panda mothers only care for one cub when twins are born			2
it 's believed the mother panda can not store enough milk to feed more than one cub as she does not store fat			0
growing fast : at this stage , the cubs weighed almost 7lb each teething : at about this age , the cubs ' teeth began to come through and they became much more active milestone : the twins at their 100 day @entity38 on october 23 to get around this problem , @entity6 staff alternated the cubs with their mother for the first few months			1
this means their mother , @entity31 , can give equal care to both cubs			0
' this technique was first developed by our colleagues at the @entity109			0
they used it for the first time in 1990 and as a result had the first pair of twins born in captivity to survive , ' writes @entity117 zoo staff will give both cubs to @entity31 when they are able to walk , at which point she will not need much help from the staff to look after her twin sons .			0

the first twin giant panda cubs to survive in the @entity2 have had their lives commemorated in a time - lapse video
