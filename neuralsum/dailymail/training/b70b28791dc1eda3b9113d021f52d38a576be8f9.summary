' when i pray , i see my children			2
' once when i was having level 10 - the worst sort of cries , when it feels like blood is coming out of my eyes - @entity20 came to me in the mirror and said , " there 's nothing to be afraid of "			1
' while mrs @entity12 admitted that she first thought she ' was a little nuts ' for the visions , she said she realised it was important to for her heeling , and professional help and readings have allowed her to accept it			2
