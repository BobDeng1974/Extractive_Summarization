@entity0 changed his mind twice while painting one of his best - known works , scientists claim - after he left out the animal which has made it famous			1
the @entity9 master 's 1490 work @entity10 features @entity12 mistress @entity11 cradling a stoat in its white winter coat , a powerful symbol of purity			1
but a three - year study has shown the artist initially painted the woman without an animal at all , then added only a spindly grey creature , before settling on the final version			1
he invented a technology called the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) to analyse each addition to the oil painting , from the wood on which the canvas was mounted to the visible pigments on top			0
he and his team projected intense lights onto the painting , which normally hangs in @entity53 , @entity54 , and analysed the way in which they were reflected			0
by taking these microscopic measurements they were able to decode how the painting had been built up over time			0
mr @entity37 told the @entity60 : ' the @entity43 technique gives us the capability to peel the painting like an onion , removing the surface to see what 's happening inside and behind the different layers of paint			2
' we 've discovered that @entity0 is always changing his mind			1
this is someone who hesitates - he erases things , he adds things , he changes his mind again and again			0
' @entity75 : @entity38 optical engineer @entity37 , who has also studied the @entity40 ( left ) , said @entity0 ( right ) was ' always changing his mind			1
this is someone who hesitates - he erases things , he adds things ' his findings have now been published in a 300 - page book about the painting and how its secrets were uncovered			0
the @entity10 was one of only four paintings of women by @entity0 , but historians had found it odd that a 1493 poem about it did not mention the animal for which it is famous			1
mr @entity37 believes the work began as a far more conventional portrait of @entity93 , who was a mistress of his patron , the @entity95			2
he said his findings suggest the @entity95 - who was nicknamed the ' white ermine ' - may have suggested the animal 's inclusion in order to reference himself in the painting			1
or his mistress , who was thought to be just 16 when @entity0 painted her , could have requested the animal in order to make her relationship with the @entity95 public			1
the ermine , which is another name for a stoat in its brilliant winter coat , was also a long - standing symbol of purity			1
admired : the work was the star turn in a major @entity0 exhibition at @entity115 's @entity114 in 2011 @entity0 wrote a catalogue of animals in which he said : ' the ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day			2
' it would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair , in order not to stain its purity			0
' its soft , unblemished coat was also prized for use in ceremonial robes , making the animal a sought - after statement of luxury and courtly wealth			0
the painting was the star turn in a @entity0 exhibition at the @entity114 in @entity115 in 2011 which attracted hundreds of thousands of art lovers			0
it was one of the first to use oil paint , a technique which had been introduced to @entity9 just a few years earlier			0
mr @entity37 co-founded the @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , an expert body on scientifically analysing paintings , and has used his technology to digitise @entity10 and the @entity40			2
he has already digitised more than 2,000 masterpieces , allowing them to be studied in great depth without being removed from gallery walls .			0

@entity9 @entity151 master painted @entity10 in 1490
stoat in white winter coat is image 's *central* symbol representing purity
but a new study reveals @entity0 first painted work without an animal
he then added in a spindly grey creature before *repainting* canvas again
changes revealed in three - year study by @entity38 engineer @entity37
he said it revealed @entity0 was hesitant and often changing his mind
