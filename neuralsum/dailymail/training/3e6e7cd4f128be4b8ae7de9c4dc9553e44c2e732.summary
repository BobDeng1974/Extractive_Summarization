@entity0 insists the quality of @entity2 is more evident when he is back home , studying the game for a second time , while others at @entity7 are generating football which inspires love at first sight			1
@entity11 swept in a majestic volley - his third important goal in as many games - and @entity15 left a positive impression on his debut , while @entity18 lifted the crowd and infected his team - mates with his aggression and desire during saturday 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity24			1
it was arguably @entity18 's most influential performance in an @entity7 shirt since his serious ankle injuries , topped with his first goal since january , a deft chip to fool @entity30 , and an assist for @entity11			1
@entity11 thought he scored the winning goal until @entity34 ' late goal @entity15 missed a golden chance to open his @entity7 account on his debut @entity15 is the third @entity37 player to play for @entity7 and @entity38 after @entity39 and @entity40			1
' he has found his pace back , ' said @entity0			2
' that for a while was not the case			2
he finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well			1
for a long time , he did not kick the ball well because of his ankle			2
' now in training , he kicks the ball well and works on his finishing			2
his shot with his ankle is now clean again			0
he has found power back			0
he stays on his feet , which is the big difference			0
when he was not as confident , he would push on his ankle and go down on his body			0
' it will not have been lost on @entity18 that @entity57 , one of his arch - critics , was pitch - side as a @entity60 pundit			1
' you can not explain his performance by the criticism of @entity57 , but you have to respond to your critics in a public job , ' said @entity0			0
one good game will not end the scrutiny			2
@entity7 and @entity68 will demand this form consistently , even if they are to play him in different roles			1
@entity0 does not want to lose his ' penetrative qualities ' by deploying him deep , as @entity72 did in @entity73 last week			0
@entity74 opened the scoring for @entity24 in a classic breakaway goal on saturday the deeper role is unnatural for @entity18 , who is more at ease bursting onto the game , exploding past opponents , threading passes and , hopefully , threatening to goal			1
' in the formation we play i should be scoring more , ' said @entity18			1
' i 've had a few chances this season			0
hopefully that will be one of many			0
i want to go forward more			0
you saw with @entity68 , sometimes i lost a bit of concentration			0
i 'm happy to play either			0
' ultimately , his efforts could not produce more than a point for his team			2
it was a third successive draw in the @entity99 for @entity7			1
like @entity24 , they are stuttering , spilling points as pacesetters @entity103 gallop on			1
@entity104 is not in the fluent groove he was and the wonderfully - gifted @entity2 flickers around the game 's fringes , irritating fans with his languid manner , having been forced wide on the left in @entity0 's new formation			1
@entity18 levelled the scoring in the second half after lobbing @entity68 team - mate @entity30 @entity18 scored a neat chip past @entity24 goalkeeper @entity30 in the 63rd minute ' people will always have this kind of attitude about him , ' said @entity0			1
' he worked hard and played quite well			0
you always see a good @entity2 when you watch the game again			2
then you realise his timing and his quality of the pass			0
' sometimes you can be frustrated during the game but you must not over-react			2
when you watch the game in a cool manner again , you see what a good player he is			2
' city are more physical , more mature and more complete than @entity7			1
@entity0 will be encouraged by team 's determination to resist and their refusal to accept the inevitable slide towards a negative result when things started conspire against them			2
' they have definitely made progress , ' said @entity140 , as he agreed the @entity141 looked ' a better side ' than last season			0
' we 're forcing it a bit more , ' said @entity18			1
' we 're not accepting it			0
we 're not just letting them play when we lose the ball			0
we want to win it back			0
that first five seconds is so important if you want to win the ball back			0
' towards the end of last season when it looked like we would n't get into the top four , we sat down and said : listen , this is n't good enough			0
since the last seven or eight games of last season until now , we 've had a fantastic attitude			0
@entity7 boss @entity0 will be pleased with his side 's second half display ' everyone in training is buying into the defensive side of the game and we want to improve that , winning the ball back high up			1
once we do that , our quality is going to change			0
' @entity0 will require this fighting spirit because bare patches are already appearing in his defensive cover after right - back @entity172 damaged ligaments in his right - ankle after catching his studs in the turf			2
@entity172 is expected to be out for two months , which will bring @entity179 , the only back - up centre - half , in at right - back			1
other defenders in the senior squad are left - back @entity182 , just back from injury , and 19 - year - old right - back @entity187 , yet to make a competitive start for @entity7			1
@entity0 admitted @entity172 's injury , in the 81st minute , hurt his team			0
' we just switched off , ' said the @entity7 boss			1
' we did not look the same team			0
not because of @entity194 but we looked a bit lost			0
' another test awaits against @entity197 on tuesday while @entity24 are also bound for @entity198 to face @entity199 , where they won last year but fell one goal short of winning the group			1
' this is an away game against one of the hardest teams to play in the world right now , ' said @entity140			2
' but we should take confidence out of the last game we played in @entity208			2
