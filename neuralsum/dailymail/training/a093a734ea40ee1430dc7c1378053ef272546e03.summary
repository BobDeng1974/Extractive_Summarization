by @entity0 the world 's oldest 20 horsepower @entity2 has sold for more than £ 25,000 after it was discovered rusting in a remote @entity5 barn			1
enthusiasts thought the 1922 @entity8 prototype , nicknamed ' @entity9 ' by its developers , was scrapped until it was spotted hidden under farm equipment by a former owner			1
experts say it could easily be worth £ 150,000 once it is fully restored - but getting it up to that standard may cost £ 100,000			1
rare find : enthusiasts thought the 1922 @entity8 prototype , nicknamed ' @entity9 ' developers , was scrapped until it was spotted hidden under farm equipment by a former owner			1
it has since been in a private museum rusting : the car sold for more than £ 25,000 but could cost £ 100,000 to restore to its original condition prototype : the car racked up more than 20,000 miles in extensive tests , including in 1922 in @entity29 , pictured the @entity2 20 - whose chassis number is @entity32 - is one of just seven experimental vehicles built in 1922 and code - named @entity8			1
the firm which was famous for the overly extravagant @entity36 used the prototype to develop a new , smaller @entity2 for the more austere world after the @entity39			1
the prototype , whose original numberplate was @entity43 , was trialled in @entity44 and @entity29 and racked up 20,000 miles before it was pensioned off in october 1925			2
it was sold to a mr @entity46 from @entity47 , who kept it until at least the 1940s			2
but the car 's trail went cold after that , and another chassis - @entity54 - was officially granted the honour of the oldest surviving @entity2 20			0
a trader bought @entity32 in 1982 , by which time its huge significance had faded into distant memory			2
prestigious : a previous seller was asked to examine the car and realised he had owned it 14 years earlier detective : the valuer then painstakingly tracked down the compelling history of the chassis fixer - upper : after its true value went neglected for so long , there is some serious work to be done on the car the name @entity2 is synonymous with over-the - top luxury , but for a brief period in the 1920s the firm made a firm push towards the middle - class			1
until 1922 , the only @entity2 available had been the hulking @entity36 , introduced in 1907 with a huge engine of more than 7,000cc			2
with a top speed of 62mph , the 20 horsepower car - nicknamed the ' @entity2 ' - was aimed towards owner - drivers instead of those with chauffeurs			2
it became popular with the burgeoning inter-war middle classes of doctors , solicitors and businessmen			0
at 4,118cc , prototype @entity92 's engine was more powerful than the 3,127cc model which would go into general production			2
its top speed was also lower , at between 47 and 50mph on a road with stable conditions but despite the experiment , @entity2 ' reputation would be firmly cemented as the car of @entity103 's very richest			0
the famous four - door @entity104 , an example of extreme luxury , was developed just three years later in 1925			2
sources : @entity2 / @entity108 he sold it the next year to a collector in @entity5 who , not knowing how important it was , left it to rust			1
fourteen years passed , and the trader built up a far fuller knowledge of @entity2 cars			0
by sheer chance , when @entity5 owner rediscovered the car and decided to have it valued , the expert was none other than its original seller from the 1980s			1
the thrilled trader bought it back and established its authenticity , and the car was reunited with its title of the oldest 20 horsepower @entity2 in the world			0
after keeping it in his private museum of classic cars for more than a decade , he decided to have it auctioned			0
the car was sold with its original instruction manual and spare parts including an engine block , front road springs , windscreen parts and floorboards			0
it sold for £ 25,520 yesterday when it went under the hammer at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145			1
@entity146 , @entity108 classic car sales consultant , said : ' to find the remains of an ancient vehicle slumbering in a barn is exciting enough			0
' it ’s every car buff ’s dream to find an historic motorcar slumbering in a barn			0
happier times : the car ( left ) being tested in the south of @entity29 in 1922 with another prototype , @entity54 ( right ) , which would later claim the title of the oldest 20 horsepower @entity2 when @entity161 was thought lost history : the car was even sold with its original 92 - year - old instruction manual ' but when that vehicle turns out to be a long - last artefact of historical importance , the thrill is all the greater			1
' fourteen years passed , during which the vendor , now a committed @entity2 20 enthusiast , had owned a whole string of these fine cars and got to know them inside out			0
' when he next stumbled across the chassis he had sold all those years before , he immediately noticed that there was something intriguing about it			1
' the more he looked , the more intriguing it got , sparking off years of painstaking research culminating in the chassis being officially recognised for what it was - the oldest @entity2 20 in existence			0
' it needs a lot of work doing to it			0
you could easily spend £ 100,000 on it if you gave it to a professional			0
