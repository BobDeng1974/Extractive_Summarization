@entity13 state police said they are looking into new evidence that @entity3 misused a trade union credit card when he was a senior union official in 2005 and 2007			2
a conviction for theft or fraud would force mr @entity3 to quit parliament and cost prime minister @entity21 's year - old government its single - seat majority			1
with opinion polls showing the government has become deeply unpopular , observers agree that the ruling @entity26 would have little hope of retaining mr @entity3 's seat in an ensuing by - election			1
mr @entity3 has denied any wrongdoing and ms @entity21 has publicly supported the mp , who was first elected when @entity26 swept to power in 2007			1
the allegation , first raised by a @entity34 newspaper in 2009 , dates back to when mr @entity3 was national secretary of the @entity35			2
he allegedly used his union credit card to pay a @entity34 brothel thousands of dollars of union money in two transactions			0
mr @entity3 has denied the allegation and claimed that an unnamed man had taken his credit card and forged his signature			0
he also said that that man had repaid the money			0
under threat : @entity21 , pictured with prince @entity45 ahead of the royal wedding in april , could lose her government 's one - seat majority mr @entity3 sued the newspaper 's owner , @entity51 , but dropped that court action in may			1

it also included a bundle of recently released court documents that @entity51 would have used in the defamation trial as proof of many more instances in which @entity3 allegedly paid prostitutes with the same credit card			0
when asked in parliament to comment on the growing scandal , ms @entity21 said : ' it would be inappropriate for me to comment further			0
' she denied any involvement in a decision by a @entity26 state branch to pay toward mr @entity3 's legal bills for settling his defamation case , adding : ' decisions about finances related to the @entity13 @entity26 are for the @entity13 @entity26 to make			1

ruling @entity26 has a one - seat majority
if found *guilty* , mp would be forced to resign
unpopular government unlikely to win by - election
