not since @entity1 has @entity0 played 40 minutes of tennis as nerve shredding as this passage that came on a @entity8 lunchtime , the conclusion of which saw him squeeze through to the last 16 of the @entity9			1
resuming at 7 - 7 against world no 24 @entity11 he needed to draw on all his @entity13 experience to eke out a 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 4 - 6 12 - 10 victory that took two days to complete and 247 minutes on the court			1
@entity0 fired home a backhand return winner on his second match point when he finally managed to prise open the highly - skilled @entity19 who , if anything , had looked the slightly better player on the resumption			1
appreciation : @entity0 thanks the crowd after winning a nerve - shredding five setter at @entity9 @entity27 : @entity0 overcame @entity11 12 - 10 in the fifth set of their @entity9 third round match going for it : @entity11 pushed @entity0 all the way in their match , which resumed at 7 - 7 in the fifth set great scot : @entity0 is a study of concentration as he plays a backhand on saturday night ' i did n’t sleep much , i kept waking up , i was ready to play at five o ’ clock this morning , ' said the @entity1 champion , who will now face the hugely powerful @entity44 left - hander @entity43 on monday			1
@entity0 had begun with an assured service game and @entity11 responded in kind			0
the first match point of the day came at 9 - 8 after he took advantage of a net cord to fire a forehand winner down the line			2
the 27 - year - old @entity35 got into the rally but was forced back and the @entity19 saved himself by firing home an overhead smash that must have taken an age to drop out of the sky			0
@entity11 had generally served more consistently while @entity0 struggled to find his first delivery again , as he had done the whole match			0
but when the world no 24 created a break point at 9 - 9 the @entity1 champion responded with a vicious swinger that his opponent could do nothing about			0
tense : @entity0 shows his emotion after hitting a blistering backhand to end the match after 247 minutes achilles heel : @entity0 struggled with his first serve , landing just 48 per cent flying high : a pigeon soars into shot as @entity0 crushes a backhand in @entity8 despondent : @entity19 's @entity11 reacts during his devastating loss at the clay court major no 1 fan : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity76 cheers for the @entity35 on his way to a dramatic victory on the whole it was the @entity19 hitting far deeper and more aggressively and @entity0 ’s best play tended to come when he was scrambling deep around the court ’s recesses			1
@entity0 missed six out of eight first serves at 10 - 10 but just about managed to hold on			2
at 11 - 10 @entity11 , who had been finding lines and corners with impressive regularity while @entity0 generally landed it shorter in the court , finally cracked			2
he pushed two groundstrokes wide and then at 15 - 40 dropped in a short second serve which his opponent pounced upon and drove forcefully into the corner			0
it was not especially pretty or elegant but he is into the second week , drawing on what separates champions from excellent all round players like the crestfallen @entity19 .			0
