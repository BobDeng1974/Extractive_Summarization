by @entity0 published : 09:49 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 28 december 2012 @entity2 leader @entity1 has been accused of betraying dozens of children hoping for a new life in the @entity5 after signing a new law blocking all adoptions by @entity9 families			1
from january 1 it will be illegal to take a baby from @entity2 to the @entity9 under the law signed by president @entity1 today			1
the move will have an immediate effect on as many as 52 children in @entity2 who were preparing for adoption - many of whom suffer disabilities or live in bleak orphanages according to charities			1
the @entity22 family from @entity23 adopted @entity24 , a four - year - old @entity2 girl with @entity26 's syndrome on @entity27 , making them among the last @entity9 parents to be permitted to do so			1
lucky : @entity30 and @entity22 , left and right , welcomed little @entity24 , centre , into their home on @entity27 just before the new ban on the adoption of @entity2 children by @entity9 families came in to force the @entity38 's welcomed little @entity24 into their home after fighting for almost a year to adopt her			1
they are among dozens of @entity9 families calling on president @entity1 to reconsider for the health of the children involved			1
the @entity46 human rights council said a total of 52 children were on the brink of being adopted and had been told they are getting a new home in @entity9			2
' we now have three children in the process of adoption , two of them are handicapped - one with @entity26 aged five and one with @entity56 aged four , ' said an official at just one agency			0
' these children are no longer so small , they understand that future parents are coming for them , they are waiting for them and the families have already visited them			2
siblings : @entity24 , 4 , pictured right with one of her new siblings , is settling in well to her new home in @entity66 , @entity23			0
critics say many other @entity2 children have been denied a similar future due to mr @entity1 's decision bittersweet : while being thrilled to have @entity24 , pictured right , the @entity38 's are heartbroken that @entity2 has finalized a ban on @entity9 adopting @entity2 children ' for us this decision is painful			1
we are working with live people			0
' ' the adoptive parents are not guilty of anything and the orphans themselves have of course done nothing wrong , ' said @entity83 , head of the @entity46 human rights council			0
president @entity1 's move is seen as revenge for a new @entity9 law banning visas for @entity2 officials implicated in the 2009 prison death of the whistle - blowing lawyer @entity91			1
several @entity2 politicians - including respected foreign minister @entity93 - spoke out against the new crackdown which was rushed through parliament in a matter of days to slap down the @entity9			1
@entity97 : @entity2 president @entity1 , pictured , has signed a bill banning @entity9 from adopting @entity2 children that has raised tensions between @entity102 and @entity103 president @entity1 ignored protests , accusing the @entity9 of ' acting brazenly and arrogantly ' towards @entity2			1
he said the ' outflow ' of children for foreign adoption posed a threat to @entity2 's future			2
' we may reach a certain point at which - once we overstep it - we will not be able to stop our ruin , ' he warned			0
so we have to be extremely sensitive and attentive toward such things			0
' @entity9 families adopted nearly 1,000 @entity2 children last year but , from january 1 , such moves will be illegal			1
the ban maybe extended soon to all foreign countries , including @entity121			0
the @entity9 is the biggest destination for adopted @entity2 children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by @entity9 over the past two decades			1
the @entity125 says it regrets the @entity2 @entity127 's decision to pass the bill , saying it would prevent many children from growing up in families			1
@entity131 and @entity133 director @entity132 said : ' this bill is frankly a childish response to the @entity135			0
' the @entity136 should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen @entity2 civil society , not weaken it			2
' @entity46 children 's tsar @entity139 said that @entity2 families would now adopt the children			1
however , they earlier declined to do so - which is why the youngsters are available for foreign adoption			0
commentator @entity146 dubbed the move ' worse than a crime			0
' ' the man responsible for this mistake is none other than president @entity1 , ' she said			1
' according to various estimates , 50 to 95 percent of children who grow up in @entity2 orphanages become drug addicts or alcoholics or commit suicide			2
@entity161 concerns : the @entity125 said it had ' deep concerns ' about the welfare of more than 700,000 @entity2 children in orphanages , particularly those with disabilities like @entity24 , pictured big brother : @entity24 , 4 , spent @entity27 day getting to know her new family in @entity23 ' @entity2 orphanages essentially produce children who suffer from @entity171 - that is , they are ill - equipped to function in any capacity in society			1
' among those condemning the new law was paralympic record breaking medal winner @entity176 , 20 , who was adopted by @entity9 parents from @entity179			2
' i love my family here in @entity9 , thanks to them @entity185 and i achieved what i achieved			2
i learned to swim and now i 've got bright future ahead of me , ' she said			0
' to prohibit adoption means to deprive these children of their bright future			0
' they have done nothing bad , these children			0
so why prohibit adoption if it would have given them a hope to have things they never had ? ' a @entity102 court today also acquitted the former deputy chief of a @entity102 prison where @entity91 was held over causing his death by negligence			0
success : @entity176 , pictured , was given up shortly after birth by her parents in @entity179 but was raised by adoptive parents in the @entity9 and became a paralympic swimming champion winner : @entity176 , pictured , won a gold medal for the women 's 100m freestyle @entity213 swimming final at the @entity214 @entity215 was the only @entity2 official to still be facing charges over the @entity91 case			1
mr @entity91 exposed an alleged £ 125 million corruption racket among senior @entity2 officials and paid with his life , say his supporters			2
the legislation was dubbed by the @entity224 press as the @entity226 law , referring to a @entity2 boy adopted in the @entity9 who died after being locked in a hot car by his adoptive @entity9 father in 2008			2
preempting criticism of the move , @entity1 promised measures to better care for his country 's orphans			1
' i intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a difficult situation , by that i mean in poor health , ' he said			0
it took about 11 months for the @entity245 to bring @entity24 home from @entity2			2
she arrived at @entity247 at 11pm on @entity27			0
' it 's been tough , but worth it , and to have her here and be part of our family , it 's now great , ' @entity22 told the @entity254			0
' we feel like we 're complete and we 're excited to have her			0
' they found @entity24 through a website that advocates for children with special needs called @entity262 ’s @entity261			0
according to the newspaper , she was the second girl they adopted from @entity2 with the help of the website			0
@entity268 , who is now 7 years old , was adopted in march 2011			0
the banning of @entity9 adoptions plays on sensitivity in @entity2 about adoptions by foreigners , which skyrocketed as the social safety net unraveled with the 1991 @entity277 collapse			1
families from the @entity9 adopt more @entity2 children than those of any other country .			1

president @entity1 accused of treating needy children as ' political *footballs* '
today he signed bill banning any @entity9 family from adopting from @entity2
many orphans and children with disabilities now lose chance to move
@entity9 families adopt more @entity2 children than any other country in world
but just *18,000* @entity2 are on the waiting list to adopt a child
