there ’s no doubt at all that this is a serious offence			0
on any view you were enormously reckless			0
‘ i accept that there was no sinister purpose of that device but the potential for it being on a street , unguarded , available in a residential area makes it obvious that the risks were significant			0
‘ i ca n’t ignore those risks			0
’ @entity106 , prosecuting , said @entity8 lived with his ex-wife in @entity32 until 2010 when the couple separated			1
‘ in august 2013 his wife decided to clear out the shed where she needed some space , ’ mr @entity106 said			0

’ @entity8 was arrested on august 18 last year and officers who searched his computer discovered material relating to making explosives , mr @entity106 added			1
the court heard how the group made the explosive devices and blew them up in a quarry in a re-enactment of an experiment on the popular @entity21 show @entity5 , which has been presented by @entity22 ( above ) ‘ it is serious and dangerous but really it seems to be a rather juvenile , amateur interest in explosives , ’ he said			1
@entity132 , defending , said @entity8 - who has since moved to @entity133 , @entity134 - was a hard - working family man with two children , aged two and 10 months			2
mr @entity132 said @entity8 made the devices with a group of friends , before taking them to a quarry in @entity14 to detonate			1
‘ one was set off inside a microwave , inspired by a programme called @entity5 , ’ mr @entity132 said			0
‘ at the end of the programme , which focused on science , various experiments were carried out in things like microwaves			0
it was used in an educational way			0
‘ that was really the catalyst for what followed			0
’ mr @entity132 said one of the devices made a ‘ loud bang ’ when it was blown up , but the others simply fizzed and smoked			2
@entity8 , who wore a smart black suit for today ’s hearing , was jailed for six months for the offence			2
as he was led to the cells , the judge told him : ‘ what a sad day for your family			0
