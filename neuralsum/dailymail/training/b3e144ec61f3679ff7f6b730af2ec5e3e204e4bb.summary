the real - life medieval society which spawned the epic poem @entity2 is coming to light in a series of ground - breaking discoveries centred around the royal court of sixth - century @entity7			1
the poem , one of the oldest literary works written in @entity11 , tells the story of how the hero @entity2 defeats the monster @entity14 , who has been terrorising the royal hall of @entity17			1
the fiend is attracted to the court by the sound of feasting - and excavations in the area thought to have inspired the poem have revealed that it did indeed host feasts on an epic scale			1
@entity27 : archaeologists believe they have found the site where the @entity11 poem beowulf was set ; @entity31 is pictured in the 2007 @entity33 adaptation of the story archaeologists are currently working in on a site in @entity37 , in eastern @entity7 , which was the centre of one of the most powerful @entity41 kingdoms from the sixth to the 10th century			1
the town is considered by scholars to be the most likely site of @entity17 , the hall of @entity47 , where the events of @entity2 are set			2
in the @entity11 epic , composed some time before the 11th century , the monster @entity14 repeatedly attacks @entity17 after becoming enraged by the sound of feasting			1
the @entity7 court is powerless to guard against the beast until the arrival of @entity2 , from the land of the @entity57 in modern - day @entity58 , who kills @entity14 and then descends under the sea and defeats the monster 's mother			2
manuscript : the one surviving copy of the poem is contained on badly burnt parchment in the @entity69 although the story of @entity2 centres around the heroic exploits of the @entity73 , it found fame in the epic poem written in @entity11 by an @entity11 bard			1
the poem , which is 3,000 lines long , is testimony to the historic links between the @entity81 and the @entity82 , some of whom emigrated from southern @entity73			0
it tells the tale of @entity2 , a @entity57 warrior from modern - day @entity73 , who travels to @entity7 to help @entity47 defend his magnificent hall of @entity17			1
@entity2 kills the monster @entity14 , saving the @entity92 from his murderous attacks , then defeats the fiend 's mother and is later acclaimed king of the @entity57			0
the poem concludes decades later with a face - off between the ageing king and a fearsome dragon , ending with the death of both			0
it could have been written as early as the seventh century , but survives only in one manuscript from the early 11th century , which is now in the @entity69 but has been badly burnt			0
the epic caught the imagination of writers such as @entity109 , and has been filmed a dozen times , including a 2007 adaptation starring @entity31 and @entity112			0
the extent to which the events of the poem are based on historical fact is controversial , but it seems to have been inspired by the wealthy @entity7 court at @entity37			1
and the current excavations have confirmed that giant feasting halls were an integral part of life at @entity37 , according to a progress report published in @entity123			2
archaeologists have found a total of seven halls dating from various points between 500 and 1000 , implying that the structures were periodically torn down and rebuilt			0
the earliest of all the halls , located 500m from all the others , is the one most likely to have provided the historical inspiration for @entity17			2
on the site there are the remains of hundreds of animals apparently killed and eaten at massive feasts , as recounted in the poem			1
the animals include cattle , sheep , suckling pigs , goats , chicken , geese , ducks , deer and fish - implying that the @entity73 elite enjoyed a diverse and luxurious diet			0
pottery drinking vessels have also been found on the site , as well as up to 40 pieces of jewellery made from precious metals			0
' for the first time , archaeology is giving us a glimpse of life in the key royal @entity7 site associated with the @entity2 legend , ' said @entity163 , of the @entity164			2
the area is thought to have been largely isolated from the rest of @entity167 , as the @entity168 did not convert to @entity169 until the 10th century			0
excavations : archaeologists are working at @entity37 , headquarters of one of the greatest @entity41 kingdoms however , excavators at @entity37 have found an animal jawbone which they believe belonged to a brown bear given to the @entity7 ruler by another @entity167 king			1
despite its historic importance , @entity37 is now a town of just 2,000 on the island of @entity183 , 23 miles west of @entity184			0
officials plan to issue a full report on their finds next year , when the exhibits will go on show at local museums .			0

excavations at @entity37 in @entity7 reveal remains of hundreds of animals
@entity196 confirms that the medieval site played hosts to *lavish* feasts
area is thought to have inspired the hall of @entity17 which is at the centre of @entity11 epic poem
