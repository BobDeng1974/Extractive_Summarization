by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 11 november 2013 @entity2 's supreme leader @entity1 controls a business empire worth around $ 95 billion - a sum exceeding the value of his oil - rich nation 's current annual petroleum exports , a six - month @entity9 investigation shows			1
the little - known organization , called @entity11 , is one of the keys to the @entity2 leader 's enduring power and now holds stakes in nearly every sector of @entity2 industry , including finance , oil , telecommunications , the production of birth - control pills and even ostrich farming			1
@entity11 has built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary @entity2 - members of religious minorities , @entity30 , business people and @entity2 living abroad			1
growth : under @entity1 ( above ) , @entity11 has expanded its corporate holdings , buying stakes in dozens of @entity2 companies the @entity9 investigation documents how @entity11 has amassed a giant portfolio of real estate by claiming in @entity2 courts , sometimes falsely , that the properties are abandoned			1
the organization now holds a court - ordered monopoly on taking property in the name of the supreme leader , and regularly sells the seized properties at auction or seeks to extract payments from the original owners			2
@entity9 reporters identified nearly 300 properties that @entity11 put up for auction in may alone , many worth millions of dollars			2
the organization 's full name in @entity57 is ‘ @entity60 ’ - headquarters for executing the @entity59			0
the name refers to an edict signed by the @entity64 's first leader , ayatollah @entity63 , shortly before his death in 1989			0
his order spawned an entity intended to manage and sell properties abandoned in the chaotic years after the @entity70			0
according to one of its co-founders , @entity11 was created to help the poor and war veterans and was meant to exist for just two years			0
almost a quarter - century on , @entity11 has morphed into a business juggernaut with real estate , corporate stakes and other assets			0
while @entity11 controls a charitable foundation , it 's not clear how much money goes to charity			0
@entity11 has built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary @entity2 , @entity9 claims			1
pictured are people at one of ayatollah @entity1 's friday prayer sermons in @entity89 under @entity1 , the organization has expanded its corporate holdings , buying stakes in dozens of @entity2 companies , both private and public , with the stated goal of creating an @entity2 conglomerate to boost the country 's economic growth			1
the supreme leader , judges and parliament over the years have issued a series of bureaucratic edicts , constitutional interpretations and judicial decisions bolstering @entity11			0
‘ no supervisory organization can question its property , ’ said @entity105 , an @entity2 lawyer who left @entity2 in 2010 and now lives in @entity106			1
in june , the @entity109 imposed sanctions on @entity11 and some of its corporate holdings , calling the organization ‘ a massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of … @entity2 's leadership			1
’ the @entity2 president 's office and the foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment for the series			2
@entity2 's embassy in the @entity124 called @entity9 ' findings ‘ scattered and disparate ’ and said that ‘ none has any basis ’ but did not elaborate			1
@entity11 's director general of public relations , @entity128 , said by email in response to a detailed description of this series that the information presented is ‘ far from realities and is not correct			0
’ he did not go into specifics			0
in a subsequent message , he said @entity11 disputes the @entity109 's allegations and is ‘ in the process of retaining @entity140 counsel to address this matter			0
’ he added : ‘ this communication puts you on notice that any action by your organization could prejudice our dispute in the @entity140 and harm our position for which we hold you responsible			0
’ @entity11 's total worth is difficult to pinpoint because of the secrecy of its accounts			2
@entity9 estimates it at around $ 95 billion , made up of about $ 52 billion in real estate and $ 43 billion in corporate holdings			0
the estimate is based on an analysis of statements by @entity11 officials , data from the @entity161 and company websites , and information from the @entity109			0
the amount is roughly 40 per cent bigger than @entity2 's total oil exports last year , which totalled $ 67.4 billion , according to the @entity166			1
there is no evidence that @entity1 is tapping @entity11 to enrich himself			2
but @entity11 has empowered him			0
through @entity11 , @entity1 has at his disposal financial resources whose value rivals the holdings of the shah , the @entity175 - backed monarch who was overthrown in 1979			2
as @entity2 's top cleric , @entity1 has final say on all governmental matters			1
his purview includes his nation 's controversial nuclear program , which was the subject of intense negotiations between @entity2 and international diplomats in @entity184 that ended sunday without an agreement			2
it is @entity1 who will set @entity2 's course in the nuclear talks and other recent efforts by the new president , @entity191 , to improve relations with @entity193			1
the investigation into @entity11 shows that as well as political power and military force there is a third dimension to @entity1 's power : economic might			1
the revenue stream generated by @entity11 helps explain why he has not only held on for 24 years but also in some ways has more control than even his revered predecessor			0
@entity11 gives him the financial means to operate independently of parliament and the national budget , insulating him from @entity2 's messy factional infighting .			1

the empire was built on the seizure of @entity2 ' property , a report claims
it gives @entity1 *considerable* economic might , the investigation says
it 's worth more than @entity2 's annual petroleum exports
