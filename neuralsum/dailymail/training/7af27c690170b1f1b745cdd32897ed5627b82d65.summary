a council 's plans to spend £ 700,000 of its budget giving every pupil a smartphone has been heavily criticised for wasting money today			1
the phones , costing around £ 150 each , will reportedly be available for every schoolchild in @entity8 who does not already have one , so that they all have wifi access at school			2
the scheme will cost an estimated £ 30,000 per secondary school and £ 10,000 per primary school			1
resistance is futile : @entity16 have decide to fund its pupils ' smartphones rather than ban them at the moment , the 24,000 pupils in the city 's schools are banned from using their mobiles in class but the initiative is expected before the start of the next school year			1
@entity27 , the council 's @entity29 - @entity28 education spokesman , argued that the money would be better spent on essential resources for schools			0
she said : ' £ 700,000 is a huge amount of money considering we 've got basic bread and butter issues that need to be resolved			2
' other schools have poor toilet facilities , another is excellent in terms of performance but the buildings are n't great and things are falling apart and walls need painting			0
' there 's always a place for technology , but i think it would make sense to address these other issues first			0
' ' digital divide ' : the head of education in @entity8 wants to buy all pupils smartphones so that none of them is left out from internet use big spending : @entity16 is using a big chunk of its education budget on internet access at school , but assured it would be supervised @entity8 schools head @entity66 defended the scheme , saying : ' we do n't want to get into a situation where we are trying to ban things that you just ca n't ban anyway , and not harnessing the powerful possibilities of the smartphones			1
' he added : ' there have been some concerns in the past that when we do these things we are creating a digital divide between those who have and those who do n't			0
we will ensure that everyone has access to devices and they will always be supervised			0
' nobody will be accessing the internet in a classroom without supervision and when they do it in the playground , they will be going through the school 's @entity95 , which is filtered			2
' part of the conversations we are having is about mitigating the risk so we will make sure that the safety procedures are in place			0
' @entity102 , leader of @entity16 , insisted that the budget will be going on upgrading internet access across @entity8 's schools and not on buying smartphones .			1

@entity16 not only wants to lift phone ban , but buy smartphones for pupils
plans will cost an estimated £ 30,000 per secondary school in the area
