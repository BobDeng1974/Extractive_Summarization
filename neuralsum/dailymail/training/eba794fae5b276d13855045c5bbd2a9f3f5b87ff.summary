by @entity0 we go on holiday to get away from it all , but three - quarters of us end up bumping into someone we know while on our travels			0
proving that it is a small world after all , a third of @entity7 say they have encountered an old friend while on holiday and an unlucky quarter have run into a work colleague			1
a new study found that old neighbours and ex-lovers are among the people holidaymakers see while travelling abroad , with an unfortunate one in 20 bumping into a former boss			2
fancy seeing you here : three - quarters of @entity7 have bumped into someone they know on holiday and we are most likely to encounter a familiar face when we 're in a pub. a fifth of people have seen someone they know in a bar abroad , while a quarter have spotted a friend on the beach , according to the research by @entity35			1
the most likely destinations where we will see an acquaintance are @entity38 and @entity39 , but you 'll also struggle to get away from people you know in the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
despite over half admitting to finding out that we are holidaying with someone we know , just under two in five ( 38 per cent ) of us actually met up when away or stay in touch when we get back			0
awkward moments : one in 20 @entity7 have bumped into a former boss on their travels and almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) of people going out of their way to get away and avoid awkward chatter			0
deliberately hiding , changing restaurants , relocating to another beach and getting an early flight home were cited as some of the extreme measure @entity7 go to , to avoid seeing someone they know			2
@entity66 psychologist dr @entity67 said : ' we often believe that we have choices when it comes to holiday destinations , but the people we spend time around unconsciously shape our preferences – a phenomenon psychologists call social influence			2
' we thus tend to form holiday preferences based on the people we like , the ones we are close to , and the ones we would like to resemble			0
from bankers in the @entity79 , to advertising managers in @entity81 , every professional group tend to have its own stereotypical holiday destination , from the bling - bling holiday spot like @entity84 , to the more bohemian one			1
' people love to self - stereotype , so it is not uncommon to find that they end up choosing a holiday destination that corresponds to the typical destination from their industry or work place			1
' hotels , airports and sightseeing experiences were also shown to be common sites for an unexpected rendezvous			2
but the study revealed that it ’s not just limited to the destinations close to home - incredibly , walking along the beach in @entity103 and picking up baggage in @entity106 airport were mentioned as locations where @entity108 had bumped into someone they knew			0
bonding moment : the most likely place for spotting a familiar face is the pub.			0
. closely followed by the beach more than one in ten @entity7 have realised they are on holiday with someone they know through the social media updates that have been shared from the sun lounger or same resort			1
dr @entity67 added : ' social media has made us more aware of the fact that our holiday destinations have much in common with the people we spend time with			1
this can also be explained by the fact that our social circles are not as big as we might think – it is estimated to be around 150 people			0
' given that we are , on average , 6 connections away from any complete stranger on earth , it makes sense that we would easily bump into people that we are directly connected to			0

@entity139 , work colleagues and even ex-lovers among those we bump into
@entity38 the most common destination to see someone you know
pub the most likely place to spot a friend , with the beach not far behind
social media making it more likely travellers realise they 're in same place
