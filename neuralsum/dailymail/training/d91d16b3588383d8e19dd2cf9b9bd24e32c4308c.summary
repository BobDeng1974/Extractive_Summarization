by @entity0 published : 16:21 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 16:21 est , 13 october 2012 as a @entity4 legend , @entity2 could have been forgiven for expecting a wardrobe of new tailor - made costumes when she joined @entity7			1
but the oscar - winning star made her debut in the hit @entity11 show in a second - hand coat that had already appeared in three other television dramas in 20 years			1
more than ten million viewers saw the 78 - year - old star of movies including @entity17 make her flamboyant entrance as @entity19 in the first episode of the new series			0
second - hand : @entity2 makes her @entity7 debut in a coat first seen on television in 1994 welcome back : the familiar coat has made an appearance in at least five television dramas her character , a wealthy @entity31 socialite , stepped out of a car in an elegant evening coat embroid ­ ered with a silk and metal thread and topped off with a fur collar and cuffs			1
it was a show - stopping arrival – but the dress had already been seen on screen several times			1
firstly , in 1994 , the actress @entity41 wore it in an episode of the @entity45 drama @entity46 , which was set in the @entity47			0
three years later it was worn in an @entity49 ­ tation of @entity52 's @entity51 – a story of love and intrigue in the @entity56 at the @entity57			2
in april , @entity59 actress and model @entity58 wore the coat in @entity11 's four - part drama @entity63 – which was also scripted by @entity7 writer @entity64			1
@entity66 's character , the flirtatious @entity67 , can clearly be seen wearing it on the deck of the doomed liner			2
a week after miss @entity72 donned the coat , it was on screen again – in the @entity45 's highly acclaimed five - part first world war drama @entity76			1
debut : @entity41 , right , gives the coat its first tv outing in 1994 as @entity79 in @entity46 in that show , @entity80 , 30 , who played the beautiful but scheming @entity81 , wore it when she visited the front line to confront her husband @entity85 , played by @entity86			1
@entity87 , the producer of @entity63 , said he had no problem with the fact that @entity67 's coat had resurfaced in @entity7			2
he added : ' i 'm delighted it 's keeping such exalted company – costumes do get recycled			0
' the fashion for reusing clothes is due partly to the fact that drama budgets have become increasingly tight			0
in addition , there has been a spate of recent productions set in the years leading up to and immed ­ iately following the @entity104 , and a consequent need for clothing to define that era			0
male stars are also having to make do with hand - me - downs			0
in tonight 's episode of @entity7 , @entity111 , who plays the gruff @entity113 , will be seen wearing a scarf previously sported by @entity115 in @entity76			2
a spokesman for @entity7 said : ' as with all television costume drama , theatre productions and films , a proportion of the costumes will be originally designed and others will be hired			0
' back again : the coat was back on television screens earlier this year with @entity58 , left , in @entity63 before returning just months later with @entity80 , right , in first world war drama @entity76			0
