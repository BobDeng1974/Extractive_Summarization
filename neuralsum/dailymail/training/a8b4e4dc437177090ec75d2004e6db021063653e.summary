by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 20:06 est , 8 march 2013 a close friend of @entity2 , a leading campaigner for draconian controls on the @entity4 , is behind a new attempt to introduce a @entity7 law by the back door			1
@entity9 , a keen supporter of @entity7 ’s plans for state - backed regulation of the @entity4 in the wake of the phone hacking scandal , was condemned last night for hijacking a key @entity14 on the economy			1
in an attempt to force the government ’s hand , he has tabled a series of amendments to the @entity21 , which aims to free businesses from red tape to boost the recovery			1
friendship : @entity9 , right , was condemned last night for hijacking a key @entity14 on the economy			1
his friend @entity2 is pictured left but critics warned that his move could derail the @entity31			0
@entity9 , a former member of the @entity32 who defected to the @entity33 and then the conservatives before sitting as a crossbencher , is an @entity37 contemporary and personal friend of mr @entity2 , the disgraced former motor racing boss who sued over sex revelations and has been intimately involved in drawing up proposals for press regulation			1
the peer wrote a controversial biography of mr @entity2 ’s father @entity43 , the former labour cabinet minister who later formed the @entity44 , in which he described him as a ‘ hero ’			2
in an interview in 2009 , @entity9 said he still saw mr @entity2 , then clinging to his job as head of @entity51 after tabloid revelations about his sexual antics			2
he told the @entity54 of his ‘ calf - like ’ love for @entity2 ’s mother and his fascination with @entity43 , a ‘ brilliant , charismatic man ’			2
his 1975 biography of @entity43 cost him his tenure at @entity60 in the @entity61 and at @entity37 and he said in 2009 that he now viewed his obsession with the fascist leader as a ‘ false trail ’			0
@entity2 was one of the key witnesses at the @entity7 inquiry and his evidence was influential in the drawing up of @entity7 ’s report			1
inquiry : @entity2 was one of the key witnesses at the @entity7 inquiry and his evidence was influential in the drawing up of @entity7 's report			1
@entity7 is pictured it was mr @entity2 who advocated a clear distinction between the bodies that write and enforce the rules on press regulation			1
he gave evidence to the inquiry having successfully sued the @entity79 for invasion of privacy in 2008 after it ran a sexual exposé on him , which wrongly suggested that consensual s&m scenes seen on video footage had a @entity86 connotation			0
@entity9 ’s amendments to the government ’s red tape @entity14 would implement the key demands of pressure group @entity87 , which is still campaigning for a @entity4 law despite @entity94 ’s rejection of the idea			1
they would require the top 20 publishers in @entity97 to be subject to a new press watchdog tasked with ensuring ‘ ethical , accurate and truthful ’ reporting			2
if any of the top 20 fail to join it would immediately trigger legislation to force them to become members			0
it would also require newspapers to carry forced apologies and give the regulator power to intervene to ensure stories comply with equalities legislation			0
and in a move that would be welcomed by embarrassed politicians , the regulator would have to protect the ‘ privacy and dignity of individuals ’			0
@entity9 ’s proposals have been drafted with the assistance of @entity119 , chairman of @entity87			1
the move comes after @entity32 mounted a separate attempt to try to establish a @entity7 law by the back door by adding amendments to a long - awaited @entity124			1
not happy : @entity32 mounted a separate attempt to try to establish a @entity7 law by the back door by adding amendments to a long - awaited @entity124			1
that was condemned by @entity130 , pictured that move was condemned earlier this week by leading writers including @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity130 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 , who said important reforms to libel law should not be jeopardised			0
government sources say mr @entity94 will not allow the legislation , aimed at addressing @entity146 ’s reputation as the libel capital of the world , to proceed while it includes provision for statutory regulation of the free press			2
the prime minister proposes underpinning a new press watchdog with a @entity154 , along the lines of the one that backs the @entity158 , rather than legislation which could be amended by future governments			0
a @entity162 source said : ‘ we are in difficult economic times and the last thing we need is the @entity32 constantly playing politics with legislation of the @entity4 and damaging important @entity168			0
‘ they saw what happened to the @entity124 and they can be in no doubt as to our response to the @entity9 amendment in the @entity21			1
we are very close to agreement on a @entity162 @entity154 deal and this is unnecessary game playing			0
’ @entity177 , the architect of the @entity124 , said : ‘ you do n’t hold legislation hostage like this on something which has nothing to do with the @entity31			0
’ professor @entity183 , executive director of @entity87 , said : ‘ we now have to face the prospect that talks to improve the @entity154 and remedy its many faults are likely to fail			0
‘ the charter as published falls far short of a regulatory system that is sufficiently independent of the newspaper industry or the government			0
‘ if the government can not abide by the recommendations of @entity7 , the victims of press abuses for whom we speak believe that the will of @entity198 should be heard			2
‘ @entity87 agrees that it is prudent for the @entity200 to be ready with a plan for @entity4 self - regulation which complies with the independent recommendations of the judge			0
