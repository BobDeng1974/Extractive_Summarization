by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 20 august 2012 double standards : inspector @entity2 , 52 , was responsible for evicting anti-social tenants - but his own property was the scene of drinking , violence and drug - taking a senior policeman who ran a ' zero tolerance ' crackdown on nightmare tenants owned a house that became notorious for wild parties , drug taking and violence			1
while inspector @entity2 , 52 , was fighting to evict thugs from a council estate in @entity19 , @entity20 , his ten - bedroom house five miles away had descended into chaos			1
@entity23 created a dossier of 49 incidents in which drunken tenants at the @entity28 townhouse had thrown bricks at them in the street and jumped up and down on cars			1
one recalled how feral dogs belonging to the ' house from hell ' would roam the street and an occasion when a woman threatened to throw herself from the second floor			1
meanwhile , @entity40 was acting as a figurehead for a major police operation attempting to reduce anti-social behaviour including street drinking and vandalism			1
now the @entity47 laws he uses on his own beat have been called upon to have his house in @entity51 , near @entity52 , boarded up and the tenants moved on			2
a neighbour said today : ' closing down that house will give us our first good nights sleep for several years			2
' he may have been been the public face of policing anti social behaviour on his beat but it is an absolute disgrace that he ca n’t keep his own house in order - literally			2
' there were always late night parties going on there and at one time there was a woman threatening to jump from the second floor			2
they had feral dogs roaming around the neighbourhood and attacking other animals			1
' at times the tenants themselves would jump on my car and throw bricks out the window			1
it was a house from hell - and i find it unbelievable it is owned by a senior police officer who should know better			2
' @entity40 - one of @entity84 ’s longest serving @entity83 officers and known as ' @entity85 ' - has more than 33 years experience , including spells in @entity88 , @entity89 , a firearms unit and on community cohesion projects			1
during the 1980s , he helped to police the @entity93 riots , and was part of the team which escorted the @entity96 back to the @entity97 to locate victims ’ bodies			0
he was eventually put in charge of policing the @entity102 estate in @entity19 , where he introduced extra high visibility police patrols and more cctv surveillance			0
groups of youths were regularly stopped and asked to account for what they were doing			0
his use of dispersal orders helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area by a third			0
@entity40 was a regular at local area meetings and warned that problem tenants would be thrown out of their homes if they repeatedly brought misery to the community			1
after one eviction , @entity40 , who lives in the @entity119 area of @entity19 , said : ' there has been a lot of anti-social behaviour , alcohol - fuelled problems and this house was the focal point			1
' we ’re sending out a strong message that if people engage in anti-social behaviour they can expect low - levels of tolerance from the police			2
we will do all we can to resolve the problem and if that means evicting people , then so be it			0
' black - spot : the ten - bedroom house was boarded up by the council after neighbours recorded almost 50 incidents of trouble from tenants but @entity40 had problems at his own property , for which his son @entity147 holds the landlord licence			1
@entity151 @entity150 was told of almost 50 incidents involving tenants of the house between july last year and june this year			0
they included loud music being played at night , foul language , fights and repeated thefts from neighbours ’ houses and the local shop			0
a dog from the house also mauled a passer - by			1
@entity165 won a three - month closure order on the house after their legal application was supported by @entity40 ’s colleagues at @entity170			1
they said the property had a ' high turnover ' of tenants and issues dated back to 2009			2
a council spokesman said : ' the @entity177 received reports of residents and their guests drinking at the front of the property , shouting , arguing , fighting , shop lifting from the local shop and even stealing from other residents at the address			0
' there were also reports of rubbish being dumped around the property , dogs allowed to roam around and on one occasion of a dog attacking a passer - by			1
' a meeting was called with all tenants to warn them of the implications of their behaviour			0
serious problem : magistrates heard that rubbish was dumped outside the house and neighbours ' homes were burgled ' when none of the tenants attended , @entity204 then tried to work with the owner of the property to resolve the problem , but when this failed they took the decision to apply for a closure order			1
' @entity52 deputy mayor @entity212 said : ' a trouble - making group of residents like this can terrorise a local community			0
' in this particular case , local residents were left feeling threatened and unsafe in their own community , which is absolutely unacceptable			0
' the work the @entity177 has done will move these individuals out of this house , meaning they can no longer pose a threat to this area			0
i hope this will also make the tenants see the error of their ways and make sure there is not a repeat of this behaviour in future			0
' the case is the first time an asbo has been served on a property in @entity20 rather than an individual			1
@entity40 said he had been the victim of a ‘ witch hunt ’ on the evidence of just one witness			2
he said he and his son had fully complied with everything council officers had asked of them			0
@entity40 is currently suspended on full pay from his post after being arrested in may 2011 on suspicion of unrelated allegations of corruption and fraud			2
he was cleared of any wrongdoing on duty but was charged with six offences of fraud and three offences under the @entity254 relating to insurance and mortgage fraud			0
it is alleged he exaggerated insurance claims following flood damage at his house and secured a mortgage at a lower rate by failing to disclose that he was buying to let			0
he will ' strenuously ' deny all charges and is awaiting trial .			0
