he told @entity61 : ‘ we 're definitely seeing a lot of rapid adoption by more and more airlines			0
’ mr @entity52 went on to say that the idea should not put off business travellers from buying luxury seats upfront because ‘ you 're going to want that peace of mind that you 're sitting in the upper level '			0
he added that @entity42 is working on a project with @entity15 , ‘ where you can bid for an extra seat next to you - a neighbour - free guarantee ’			2
