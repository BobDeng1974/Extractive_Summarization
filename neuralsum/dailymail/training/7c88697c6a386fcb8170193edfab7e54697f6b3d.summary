by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 numbers @entity4 as only a ' so - called friend ' after his former team - mate 's assertion that @entity8 would be better off without his captaincy at the @entity10			1
@entity3 's team put in a wretched performance with ball and then bat on the way to a 133 - run @entity17 defeat against @entity18 in @entity19 - after which he was at a loss to explain why they were ' not at the races '			1
there was little to cheer on the field as @entity24 hit a brilliant 74 - ball hundred in @entity18 's 304 for six and then @entity8 were bowled out for 161 in pursuit of a revised target of 295			1
' i do n't think it 's that helpful - especially from a so - called friend , ' said @entity3 , who spent much of the summer resisting similar calls to step aside from the test captaincy - before making many eat their words as @entity8 fought back to beat @entity18 3 - 1			1
@entity4 is adamant @entity55 strike rate does not set the tone that will make @entity8 competitive in next year 's @entity10 in @entity57 and @entity58			1
knock : @entity3 plays a shot during the second @entity60 between @entity8 and @entity18 video @entity3 targets fight back after @entity19 defeat ' he 's entitled to his opinion , ' added @entity3			1
' ( but ) it 's not ideal for me , especially when you get through the summer i 've had			2
' he has not contacted @entity4 - but has left open the possibility that a call could come in the opposite direction			1
' the phone is always open the other way , ' said @entity3 , before repeating he will not be deflected from his intention to lead @entity8 down under next winter			1
i am a little bit ( disappointed ) - because he is a good friend of mine , and has been a supporter			2
' it 's not helpful at this time , because i am going to be captain in this @entity10			2
i 've done it for three - and - a - half years			2
we 're going to build up to that , and we 've got a good chance			0
' @entity3 acknowledges , however , much better will be required if @entity8 are to beat the best			1
jubilant : @entity18 fielders @entity87 ( right ) and @entity24 celebrate after dismissing @entity88 ' obviously , if we play like that we 're not going to win many games of cricket			2
but the talent in the changing room is there			0
we 've got a lot of improvement to do			0
we were n't quite at the races today , and i do n't quite know why			0
' @entity8 began well with the ball , reducing @entity18 to 19 for two , and then with the bat as @entity3 and debutant @entity102 put on a half - century opening stand			1
but precious little else went right			0
' you could look at some good spots , i suppose , ' said @entity3			2
' i thought @entity107 bowled nicely up front , and came back pretty strong when the carnage was happening			0
@entity110 : @entity18 's @entity24 celebrates getting 100 runs against @entity8 as he inspired his side to victory ' obviously , it was n't a 300 wicket - and it was n't a 160 wicket			1
' but it 's one game , is n't it ? it 's one day of cricket			2
' when you do n't get it right - like we have n't today - it 's not the @entity126 at all			2
' @entity8 are 1 - 0 down , as they were after two tests , and as then too they still have three to play			1
their next opportunity will come at @entity129 on saturday			0
' you do n't win every game of cricket you play - and you certainly do n't win many when you play like that , ' added their captain			0
' the lads in the changing room will know that			0
they do n't need me to tell them			0
jubilation : the @entity18 team celebrate after beating @entity8 by 133 run on wednesday ' so , it 's dust ourselves off and try to come back and play better next time			1
' for @entity3 's opposite number @entity87 , there is a contrasting mission - to try to stay in front this time			1
@entity87 shared a stand of 144 with @entity24 , and was one of two batsmen apart from the centurion to pass 50			0
it was @entity24 's hundred that changed the game , and @entity87 said : ' it was a fantastic knock			0
' it was important he stayed there , because he was one batsman who was set			0
' we realised that if we could get a partnership going , if we had wickets in hand , we could make a lot of runs in the last 10 - 12 overs			0
' so his innings was very crucial			0
