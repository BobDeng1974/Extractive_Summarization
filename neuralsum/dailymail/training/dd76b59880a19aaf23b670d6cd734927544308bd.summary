swapping stockings for kisses and teaching girls how to jive , @entity1 gis were meant to be a welcome ray of sunshine in war - torn @entity8			1
but a new book has revealed the dark side of @entity8 ’s liberation after the @entity12			1
professor @entity14 , from the @entity13 , said within months of @entity15 ordinary @entity17 women came to fear their @entity1 ‘ liberators ’			1
@entity1 soldiers seen here ( who are not related to the book 's content ) disembarking from @entity24 landing craft at the shores of @entity26			1
in an explosive book , @entity14 claims that some soldiers terrified @entity17 citizens the professor said previous historical research on the subject paid little attention to this ' dark side ' of @entity8 's liberation			2
the people in this picture are not related to the book 's content she tells how , by the summer of 1944 , large numbers of women in @entity26 filed complaints about rapes by @entity1 soldiers			1
and their arrival prompted a wave of crime all over @entity17 , with @entity1 soldiers caught committing robberies and petty thefts			1
professor @entity14 said : ‘ my book seeks to debunk an old myth about the @entity52 , thought of as a manly creature that always behaved well			1
the gis were having sex anywhere and everywhere			0
‘ in the cities of @entity60 and @entity61 , bad behaviour was common			0
‘ women , including those who were married , were openly solicited for sex			2
parks , bombed - out buildings , cemeteries and railway tracks were carnal venues			0
‘ people could not go out for a walk without seeing somebody having sex			0
‘ but the sex was not always consensual , with hundreds of cases of rape being reported			2
’ the locals of @entity60 were shocked by the soldiers ’ behaviour and wrote letters of protest to their mayor			0
one complaint , from october 1945 , said : ‘ we are attacked , robbed , run over both on the street and in our houses			0
the book , which was released in june , focuses specifically on the soldiers of @entity12 and their interaction with the @entity17 people , but problems of sexual assault in the military persist to today , though now the victims are those in uniform as well			1
the @entity95 is reeling from a series of sex - related scandals in recent weeks , including cases in which military advocates for victims of sexual assault were themselves accused of sex crimes			1
figures from the @entity95 show a 37 per cent increase in reports of unwanted sexual contact , from groping to rape , last year			0
about 26,000 cases were reported in 2012			0
' sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal - a profound betrayal - of sacred oaths and sacred trusts , ' mr @entity108 said			2
' this scourge must be stamped out			0
' his comments came a day after president @entity117 delivered a similar message to graduates at the @entity120 in @entity121 , saying sexual assault threatened to erode trust and discipline in @entity1 's armed forces			2
‘ this is a regime of terror , imposed by bandits in uniform			0
’ @entity60 ’s mayor , @entity130 , complained to colonel @entity131 – the commander of @entity1 troops in the region			2
‘ scenes contrary to decency are unfolding in this city day and night , ’ @entity130 wrote , adding it was ‘ not only scandalous but intolerable ’ that ‘ youthful eyes are exposed to such public spectacles ’			0
the mayor suggested the @entity1 set up a brothel outside the city to avoid public outrage and contain the spread of sexually transmitted diseases			2
however although @entity1 officers publicly denounced the behaviour they did little to curtail it			0
the book also claims the @entity1 army ‘ demonstrated a deep and abiding racism ’ , suggesting they pinned a disproportionate number of rapes on black gis			1
documents show that of 152 troops disciplined by the army for rape , 130 were black			0
professor @entity14 said : ‘ @entity1 propaganda did not sell the war to soldiers as a struggle for freedom but as a sexual adventure			1
’ she points out that @entity166 , the official newspaper of the @entity1 armed forces , taught soldiers @entity171 phrases like ‘ waffen niederlegen ’ meaning ‘ throw down your arms ’			2
however the @entity17 phrases it recommended to soldiers included ‘ you have charming eyes , ’ ‘ i am not married ’ and ‘ are your parents at home ? ’ @entity1 magazine life even fantasised that @entity17 was ‘ a tremendous brothel ’ inhabited by ‘ 40,000,000 hedonists , who spend all their time eating , drinking and making love ’			2
a cafe owner from @entity60 said at the time : ‘ we expected friends who would not make us ashamed of our defeat			0
instead , there came only incomprehension , arrogance , incredibly bad manners and the swagger of conquerors			0
’ the author claims that when the first soldiers swarmed ashore at @entity201 in @entity26 ( pictured ) on @entity15 , it was ' a veritable tsunami of male lust ' controversial : @entity14 wrote the book to uncover the reality about some @entity52 soldiers controversial : @entity208 mayor @entity207 said that soldiers used ' comfort women ' as ways to release tension during @entity12 the book comes just one day after a @entity215 politician sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during @entity12 was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country 's of using the same practice			1
@entity208 mayor @entity207 , co-leader of an emerging nationalist party , argued @entity215 's wartime practice of forcing @entity225 women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers			1
but following the public outcry over his comments , the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing @entity1 and @entity234 of using sex slaves for its own soldiers			1
he said : ' it is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons			0
this is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true			0
' historians say up to 200,000 women , mainly from the @entity247 and @entity248 , were forced to provide sex for @entity215 soldiers in military brothels			1
while some other @entity12 armies had military brothels , @entity215 is the only country accused of such widespread , organized sexual slavery .			1
