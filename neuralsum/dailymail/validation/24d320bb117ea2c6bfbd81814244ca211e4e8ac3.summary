@entity0 says telling the truth about the size of his manhood was ' liberating ' new statistics reveal that the average sized penis is only 5.16 inches , smaller than originally thought , but what 's it like if you do n't measure up to the norm ? one man with a with a small member recently blogged about the perils of having a tiny todger - and his post went viral			1
here , writer @entity0 , a 47 - year - old engineering manager from @entity13 , explains why he decided to share his vital statistics and explains what it 's like to be a few inches short			1
' last year i wrote a poem and blog post about penis size anxiety			1
it was painfully autobiographical , but the harder it was to write , the more important it seemed to be			2
' i 'm 48 now , and i 've been struggling with this anxiety for decades , even though i 'm very happily married			1
' men have a great capacity for emotional deniability			1
as long as we 're not confronted with our vulnerabilities we can pretend they do n't exist			2
' it was a drunken evening talking to a new , but good friend , when somehow or other the question of size came up and i admitted i had such worries			1
' i was very drunk , and just could n't face lying once again			2
to my surprise , he said he did too			2
a comrade in arms i thought , as we sheepishly swapped statistics - he went first and admitted to only possessing 6 "			1
i told him i had 4 , and his relief was palpable			2
' telling this truth was truly liberating , and being able to reassure my friend was rewarding			2
this is when i realised how pervasive , and pointless , size anxiety is			1
i realised my own perspective could help many others too			2
' so i published the blog in the hope that if more smaller guys were open and honest we could establish a more realistic view of what average is - rather than only ever seeing the behemoths that porn and advertising presents to us			1
@entity0 says men should be more open and honest to establish a more realistic view of what average is ' for the next few months i performed the poem at various venues around @entity13			1
there was always at least one warm handshake afterwards from a guy who seemed particularly glad that i 'd openly discussed the question of size , from my perspective			1
' then in september last year the world 's media took notice and i found myself giving interviews around the globe			2
it seems like i 'd found some kind of magic formula			0
a way of talking about the issue that was neither too puerile nor too painful			0
suddenly everyone was talking about my small , but perfectly functioning , willy ! ' and i was personally responding to thousands of men ( by @entity80 and e-mail )			1
so much so that it became impossible to keep up			0
i felt tremendously proud to have achieved this through poetry , to be able to make poetry relevant in the mainstream			1
' at this point @entity87 asked if i 'd like to make a short documentary - and i thought if i ca n't reply personally to everyone this was an opportunity to spread my positive take to so many more people			0
' with the promise of being able to make something enduring i was able to garner the support to organise @entity98			1
' this meant i had to really think through the issues - remember , i 'd spent most of my life in denial so this was a journey of discovery for me too			0
@entity0 says he first experienced penis size anxiety while getting changed for sports at school ' first i remembered a time , age 13 , in the school changing room putting my shorts on while i was still wearing my long winter coat			1
i did n't even know what penis size anxiety was then , or why i was doing that , but i did			1
' growing up i realise more girls asked me out than vice versa , i must have been reasonably attractive - but i never knew it			0
' by age 18 i was suffering openly from other ( young ) men laughing at me in the locker room or at the urinal			2
i became very shy to the extent that i 'd find reasons to put off " that first time " with girlfriends that i did have			0
' i worked hard and i was successful in every other way , but i had zero self respect			0
and i was very , very bad at sex			0
not at all because of my small member , but because i never dared practice enough and i never believed i could be anything other than abysmal in that department			0
' thankfully , after only 17 years my wife has taught me differently ! ' the party was an attempt to head off these , needless , difficulties for others			0
in and of itself , on the night it certainly worked			0
we got a great cross section of people attending , including guys of all ages and sizes ( we surveyed the audience )			0
' i know there were smaller guys there taking a moment of relief			0
one gentleman travelled from northern @entity154 specifically for the party			0
and i heard others talking about how they would never again shout " @entity157 ! " when they see particularly bad driving			0
' but the party is just the beginning			0
already others around the world are asking my advice on how to do something similar , and of course soon we will have the short documentary ready too			0
' i do believe , in some small way , @entity98 has made the world a little better place			1
