by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor deputy prime minister @entity2 , pictured leaving his house this morning , is assessing the damage to the @entity6 ' local government base @entity2 today refused to resign as @entity6 leader after losing control of some of his party 's flagship councils			1
the @entity6 were ousted from @entity12 after a surge of support for @entity15 while the @entity16 took control of @entity18 - upon - @entity19 - the local authority of energy secretary @entity21			1
a rare glimmer of good news came in @entity24 , where the @entity6 have tightened their grip on the local authority after successfully defending the parliamentary seat in a by - election last year			1
mr @entity2 conceded that his party had suffered at the hands of a @entity15 surge , blaming a ' very strong anti-politics feeling among the public			0
but he added : ' actually i think in the areas where we have mps where we have good organisation on the ground ... we are actually doing well			0
' the @entity6 are are on course to lose around 300 seats			1
earlier @entity6 minister @entity42 said her party had lost its ‘ humanity ’ in office			1
‘ @entity15 have managed to sound like human beings – that ’s @entity49 ’s big win , ’ she told the @entity46			0
‘ all of us have become so guarded , we are so on - message that we seem to have lost some of our humanity			0
‘ the @entity6 are the whipping boys in the coalition			2
in the last general election debates @entity2 came across as the human being … partly being in government , we have become more ministerial , we have become more political			0
we have lost some of the humanity @entity2 had four years ago			0
’ with rumours swirling of a leadership plot , mr @entity2 has urged his party not to ‘ lose its nerve ’ just as the government ’s key decisions are being ‘ vindicated ’			0
mr @entity2 told reporters it was ' never easy ' seeing ' dedicated , hard - working ' councillors kicked out			0
but he said he would ' absolutely not ' resign , and insisted the @entity6 were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition			2
' based on the results which have come in so far , it has obviously been a mixed result , a mixed night for my party , for the @entity6 and the other mainstream parties , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' we will see what the further results today , what story they tell			0
but so far what i have seen is that where we can work really hard to tell our side of the story , we can win			0
' he added : ' i certainly accept that there is a very strong anti-politics mood around , not only in our country but in many other parts of @entity90 as well			2
i think you will see that in @entity90 elections in the days to come ... ' there is a very strong mood of restlessness and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics and that is reflected in the results for all mainstream parties , including the @entity6			1
' mr @entity2 is under fresh pressure , with the @entity6 braced to lose many of their meps when the @entity90 election results emerge on sunday night @entity104 : did well in @entity24 - stopping @entity15 from taking any seats on council			1
@entity107 : @entity12 slipped into no overall control , as @entity15 took four seats			1
tories took overall control of @entity18			1
deputy leader of the @entity6 sir @entity115 played down his party 's losses and stressed it intended to be a ' major force ' in @entity121 politics for the foreseeable future			2
he told @entity123 : ' it is obviously disappointing to lose councillors , particularly those who have worked hard in their community and may have been replaced by those who have n't got a track record			0
' but actually we are pleased that where we have targeted our resources , particularly in held seats or key seats , we have actually had very good results			2
' that 's really very important for us			0
getting an even share across the country does n't deliver seats , getting them in the seats that matter is what matters to us			0
' senior party figures dismiss ideas that mr @entity2 could be replaced by @entity143 or @entity144 , but are preparing for a bumpy few weeks if the results are bad			0
in several @entity90 election polls , the party has been languishing in fifth place behind the @entity149			1
a poll suggests that only 46 per cent of @entity6 voters would want mr @entity2 to stay in his job if the party ends up in that position			2
@entity155 and senior @entity16 , however , are said to be planning a ‘ @entity159 ’ operation that will see the @entity6 given ‘ wins ’ in the forthcoming @entity158			1
@entity6 sources insisted their vote was holding up well in their parliamentary seats , and that both the @entity16 and @entity112 were falling short of the sort of results they need to demonstrate if they want to win a majority next year .			1

@entity167 : @entity6 have *404* seats , down *284* . hold 6 councils , down 2
@entity6 dems lose @entity12 and @entity16 *rob* them of @entity18 - upon - @entity19
@entity112 takes control of @entity113 after kicking out @entity6
@entity90 election results will not be *announced* until sunday night
