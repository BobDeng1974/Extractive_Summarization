a union has slammed train companies after a rail worker took pictures showing tomatoes growing in human excrement on the tracks			1
the pictures , taken at @entity8 on the @entity9 to @entity10 line , appear to show human waste left on the commuter line in @entity14			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) called on the government to ban trains using old - fashioned carriages which flush sewage onto the tracks			1
tomatoes were seen growing from human excrement on the on the @entity9 to @entity10 line at @entity8 by a rail worker the union says dumping waste on the track is ' dangerous ' and that rail staff are often ' sprayed ' with excrement			1
@entity15 general secretary @entity30 said : ' it shames @entity33 's railways that tons of human excrement is being dumped straight on the tracks while the private train companies make huge profits and the government does nothing			1
' not only does this create filthy and dangerous working conditions for rail staff who are routinely sprayed with this waste but it also shows that the government are prepared to tolerate this scandal while greedy rail operators make a killing			1
' @entity15 will continue to fight for an end to this disgusting and dangerous practice and it â€™s the greedy , profiteering train companies who should foot the bill			0
' the line is used solely by @entity57 trains			0
a spokesman said : ' a number of our trains already have retention tanks fitted and some additional carriages are going to be upgraded with new toilets and retention tanks			1
' we are also looking into the potential options for extending these facilities across the rest of the fleet of trains used on our services in the future			0
' earlier this year , great - grandmother @entity74 , 64 , was forced to ban her young family from playing in her back garden because passing trains kept spraying it with excrement a spokesman for the @entity81 , which represents rail operators and @entity83 , said : ' the rail industry takes this issue , and feedback from customers and staff , very seriously and understands that it can be very unpleasant for track workers			2
most modern trains are built with retention tanks , which hold waste in a septic system until it can be removed at a depot			1
but older trains , particularly those built before the rail network was privatised in the 1990s , are still running with the older system which sees waste flushed directly from the toilet on to the tracks			2
most of the offending trains are rolling stock or high - speed diesel locomotives			0
because of their size , it is not always possible to fit the tanks onto trains built in the 1970s and 1980s , however the older models are gradually being phased out			2
' investment in new rolling stock since the mid- 1990s means the majority of trains do not have to discharge waste onto tracks , and we continue to find ways to modify older vehicles			0
' the minority which do not have toilet tanks fitted will reduce further as new trains are introduced			2
' earlier this year , great - grandmother @entity74 , 64 , was forced to ban her young family from playing in her back garden because passing trains kept spraying it with excrement			0
trains using the line between @entity129 and @entity130 , on the @entity131 , are also too old to have sewage tanks fitted , meaning that waste was dumped on to the track by mrs @entity74 's house			1
she said at the time : ' it covered my sheets and pillow cases and i had to shut all of the windows			0
i did n't know where it had come from - i thought it was coming from planes flying overhead			0
' i could n't believe the mess , it was atrocious			0
' i 've got two great - grandchildren of two and five and i ca n't let them play in the garden because it is very dangerous			0
