despite looking like it could be from a far off galaxy in a @entity4 film , this landscape is a natural sulphur spring in @entity6			1
with its vibrant yellows and deep dark browns the ground appears as though it could be home to some sort extra-terrestrial life form but is just created by high levels of salt			2
neat hills of solid salt rise nearly as tall as the mounds of dirt next to them			2
this otherworldly landscape is really a natural sulphur spring in @entity21 , @entity22 created by high levels of salt , the ground appears as though it could be home to extraterrestrial life forms @entity28 - based photographer , @entity27 , captured these impressive sights photographer @entity27 , from @entity28 , battled oppressive heats up to 53 degrees @entity32 to capture these landscapes in the @entity34 of @entity21 , @entity6			1
@entity27 said : ' @entity35 is like stepping onto another planet			0
' and like a trip to space , this otherworldly destination can also cause distress to its visitors			0
' the heat , sulphur , acidic waters and some of the ground was quite thin to the point where i thought i would break through and boil myself to death , ' he added			0
' there was so much colour and beauty that i was n't sure that i could do it justice photographically			0
' battling intense heats of up to 53 degrees @entity32 , @entity27 ventured to the @entity34 to shoot ' it 's like stepping onto another planet , ' @entity27 said of visiting the springs although it may look like a lake , the salt ground is actually several kilometres deep in places though @entity27 is from @entity62 , where they have their own springs , he was struck by the beauty in @entity21 @entity27 is from @entity62 in @entity28 where they have their own geothermal springs , but was still taken aback by the @entity6 landscape			1
he said : ' due to its high salt levels and other minerals , @entity21 was an extremely concentrated area of micro activity and was definitely brighter and more varied than what i 've seen before			2
' ' there is a high concentration of salt as the entire area is lower than sea level and was once upon a time underwater			1
' ' we were told that the ' lakes ' we drove across to get there [ were made of ] salt that was kilometres deep in places			0
' ' besides the searing heat , the first thing that i noticed was the smell - very similar to rotting eggs , which reminded me of my childhood playing in @entity62			0
' ' i thought i would break through the ground and boil myself to death , he says of the treacherous conditions the springs were once underwater , which helps to explain the low sea level and high salt concentrations pictured : a soldier admiring the hot springs from atop a mound of dirt and rock			1
