by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 who should be @entity3 's next captain ? to appreciate what playing for @entity3 meant to @entity5 , let us to take you back to early november 2012 and the place where it all began for him			1
ahead of his landmark 100th appearance against @entity12 , @entity5 had agreed to pose for a photograph for @entity14 with pupils from his first school , @entity17 with @entity18 , wearing his 99 caps			2
the idea was to re-create the famous image @entity22 has taken of @entity23 , with @entity5 sitting in amongst the children , cap-less , wearing a gleaming white @entity3 shirt			1
the children who had been chosen to appear on the photograph were in position on the schoolyard , eagerly awaiting his arrival , when the time for @entity5 to make his entrance came			1
it was in that moment the enormity of everything he had achieved - from the young lad who had dared to dream to the man who became @entity3 captain - appeared to hit him			2
he loved being involved in the project and the shirt he wore for the picture now currently hangs in a frame in that assembly hall , a permanent reminder to those who sit in the same classrooms about what can be achieved with hard work , determination and dedication			0
that is why there are no empty words when @entity5 says his decision to call time on playing for @entity3 career was ‘ one of the hardest decisions ’ he has ever made ; he will have consulted many family and friends , most notably his wife , @entity72 , @entity74 manager @entity73 , @entity3 head coach @entity75 and his trusted long - term agent @entity76 - before making this announcement			1
this has not just been made on a whim			0
and it is the right decision because he has made it himself			0
@entity3 would have definitely been richer for his presence and experience in the @entity85 qualification campaign but the baton has now been passed on			2
end of an era : @entity5 was made captain for the @entity89 in @entity90 young guard : @entity92 may be handed the chance to replace @entity5 for @entity3 obvious choice : @entity95 ( right ) is the bookies ' favourite to replace @entity5 ( left ) as @entity3 captain @entity99 : @entity5 spoke with @entity73 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) before making his mind up he is going on his own terms and that will inevitably benefit @entity74 , particularly with an assault on the @entity105 looming			1
@entity5 , who turned 34 in may , explained : ' @entity73 has been fantastic and obviously i have to look after my body as much as possible to ensure i can give everything when i take to the field			0
‘ to ensure i can keep playing to a high level and giving everything to @entity74 i believe this is the right decision , and having @entity105 football back at @entity114 is another big factor in my decision			0
' @entity117 may have been crowned the @entity119 and @entity120 last season , after his 31 goals propelled @entity74 to the brink of the @entity124 title , but the influence @entity5 had on the assault should not be underestimated			1
his slip against @entity128 that gifted @entity129 a crucial goal may still be fresh in the memory but that should not be why his most recent campaign is remembered			0
@entity134 performer : @entity135 skipper @entity5 was in outstanding form for @entity74 last season patriotic : @entity5 , pictured holding the @entity3 flag , has played his last game for his country among the best : @entity5 , pictured alongside @entity142 , kisses the @entity105 in 2005 @entity144 @entity74 legends salute @entity5 @entity5 was brilliant last season , the driving force in a number of crucial wins , converting ice - cool penalties and dictating play from a deep - lying position			1
it has been called the ' @entity152 ' but on @entity154 it has become known , simply , as the ' @entity5 role '			2
he still has much to give at the highest level and nobody at @entity114 is looking forward more to hearing that instantly recognisable @entity105 music blasting out from the speakers once more and coming up against the biggest names in @entity161 ; showdowns with @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 are what @entity74 's no 8 is made for and saying goodbye to @entity3 will mean he is primed for such occasions			1
but do not think that he has relished terminating a journey that started in may 2000 against @entity170 and , ultimately , ended with a brief substitute appearance against @entity172 in @entity173			0
he loved putting @entity3 on his chest - that was abundantly clear one friday morning on a schoolyard in @entity17 .			0

@entity74 captain @entity5 has called time on his @entity3 career
@entity5 captained @entity3 at the @entity181 in @entity182
the experienced *midfielder* wants to concentrate on @entity74
