by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 11:43 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 22 july 2013 it is thought that @entity3 was 41 weeks pregnant today and comfortably within the normal margin for giving birth			1
she is pictured shopping in @entity6 last month @entity7 of @entity8 was definitely overdue when she went into labour yesterday , according to @entity11 sources			0
it is thought she may have been 41 weeks pregnant — a week overdue – but comfortably within the normal margin for giving birth			1
in fact , fewer than one in 20 women give birth on their due date			1
around half go into labour up to two weeks after this point , the expected date of delivery given at the start of the pregnancy			1
some mothers have their labour medically induced during this period because of concerns about their health and that of the baby			2
professor @entity31 , an internationally renowned specialist in obstetrics , says it is more accurate to talk about a ‘ due month ’ of birth because each woman ’s circumstances are different			2
the professor , who is based at @entity38 , @entity6 , said his unit ’s policy is not to intervene until a woman is two weeks overdue , unless there is cause for concern			2
professor @entity31 explained : ‘ most women want to give birth naturally when possible and if there is no reason to induce , we ’d rather not because it involves using drugs			1
only about 4 per cent of women deliver on their due date , so it ’s better to talk about a due month , because when they are giving birth naturally around half will deliver later			1
’ the placenta , the baby ’s support system in the womb , is equipped to last for between 40 and 42 weeks			1
if labour does not start during this period there is a risk of the baby running out of nutrients — when it has never been bigger or needier			0
when a decision is taken to induce labour , a variety of drugs can be used to soften up the cervix and start contractions			0
like thousands of other first - time mothers , @entity3 would have been asked to keep track of her contractions at home			0
she would have had instructions to contact her medical team when they were strong and regular , coming at the rate of two or three every ten minutes , or if she was worried			0
professor @entity31 , a leading researcher for the baby charity @entity94 , said : ‘ it ’s ok to stay at home at this stage and there is some evidence that women do better as a result			0
‘ when they increase to three or four every ten minutes then normal labour has started and she will need to set off for the hospital , allowing for the time of day and traffic			0
’ professor @entity31 says it is more accurate to talk about a ' due month ' of birth as each woman 's circumstances are different			2
@entity3 is currently in the @entity110 of @entity111 ( pictured )			0

fewer than than one in 20 women in the @entity115 give birth on their ' due date '
about half of babies are born after their mother 's ' due date '
it is thought that @entity3 was a week overdue
@entity126 tends to be induced if the baby is more than two weeks late as the placenta is not equipped to last for *longer*
