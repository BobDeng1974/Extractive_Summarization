it became as certain as death and taxes that @entity7 's finest would be embarrassed , dismantled and have their backsides handed to them on a silver platter in @entity6 this week			1
but the race to find a place at @entity12 football 's top table back at home continues			2
just once in the @entity16 's 22 - year history has it been as tight between third and seventh by february 28 , and not even @entity17 – the top four guru himself – can call this one			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 are on 48 , 47 , 46 , 45 and 44 points respectively and , like @entity28 preached on @entity29 , it ’s points that make prizes			1
@entity22 manager @entity17 ( left ) and @entity23 boss @entity32 ( right ) are in the running @entity25 manager @entity34 ( left ) and @entity24 's @entity35 ( right ) are fighting for a place @entity26 manager @entity37 is bringing up the rear in the race to qualify for @entity6 a game - by - game graph that shows how the race for @entity43 qualification is hotting up and @entity22 are silently racking them up			1
finishing in the top four has , in some cruel corners , been labelled the @entity46			0
yet true to form they have crept to third while the rest scrap among themselves			0
@entity22 last finished outside the top four in 1996 and , if the remaining 12 fixtures in the @entity16 are anything to go by , then @entity17 can expect same old , same old			1
on paper they have the easiest run - in , if there is such a thing			0
@entity22 have to play just three of the seven teams at the top of the @entity16 , while @entity23 face five			1
it could spell make or break for those two when , on may 16 , they meet for the penultimate weekend of the season at @entity61			0
@entity23 captain @entity62 and his team - mates have a tough task on their hands to qualify @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity62 ( from left to right ) pictured during their defeat by @entity70 @entity23 have their work cut out for them if they are to qualify for the @entity43 , as they face five of the current top seven before the season 's end on may 24			1
mar 15 - @entity26 ( h ) mar 22 - @entity25 ( a ) apr 12 - @entity76 ( h ) apr 18 - @entity78 ( a ) may 16 - @entity22 ( h ) @entity80 and his @entity22 team - mates appear to have the best run - in when the fixtures are broken down yet @entity24 – the club that were priced at 6/1 pre-season to be relegated , having lost @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , chairman @entity90 and manager @entity37 – will want to have a say			1
four years ago this very weekend , @entity24 were scrapping in @entity93 , losing 1 - 0 against @entity94 in front of a 4,684 attendance			1
from the third tier to the first ; from @entity98 to champagne ; from @entity94 to , just maybe , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 ? they have never finished in the top four of the @entity16 , but last did so in @entity106 in 1984			1
@entity22 , meanwhile , did so last year , as did @entity25			2
@entity23 two years ago , and @entity26 three			1
@entity24 need only to maintain the momentum that kept them inside the top four for 18 weeks this season – more than @entity23 ( 15 ) , @entity22 ( 5 ) , @entity26 ( 1 ) and @entity25 ( 1 )			1
@entity35 ’s team are the romantic option to be among @entity6 ’s elite			0
yet in february they lost against @entity25 , were held by @entity114 , beaten by @entity70 and ca n’t ride on the coattails of their early - season form for much longer			2
@entity118 celebrates scoring against @entity24 as @entity25 beat the top four pretenders 2 - 0 @entity25 saw off @entity24 2 - 0 as @entity35 's men suffered a dip in form throughout february @entity25 's incredible @entity16 form in 2015 has seen them become top four contenders again @entity24 need to maintain the momentum that kept them inside the top four for 18 weeks this season form comes as easily as it goes			1
@entity25 – unbeaten in 10 @entity16 matches – are a vastly different prospect to the team that surrendered at the @entity130 on november 4			2
it took them five years to return to the most prestigious @entity12 stage , only to end in a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity101 and a 2 - 1 loss against @entity78 in the @entity16 four days later			1
it took cojones from @entity34 to field a weakened team against @entity138 et al , and the ends did not justify the means			0
yet a miniature head - to - head table between the five clubs chasing @entity43 qualification , shown below , puts @entity25 ( 13 points ) ahead of @entity23 ( 10 ) , @entity26 ( 8 ) , @entity24 ( 6 ) , and @entity22 ( 5 )			1
a head - to - head table between the five clubs chasing @entity43 qualification puts @entity25 top @entity25 are fighting @entity24 and three other clubs to qualify for next season 's @entity43 and it ’s not the first time they ’ve been in a tight corner			1
the only other occasion the gap between third and seventh was so close was in february 2001			2
@entity157 ’s @entity25 in third were just three points from @entity159 in seventh			2
yet even then , they were two games clear of the clubs around them , having been pre-occupied between february 15 and 25 by the @entity165 fifth round , two @entity167 fourth round legs , and the @entity169 final			2
@entity25 won all three of those tournaments as @entity157 delivered the treble , and a baby - faced , shaven - headed @entity172 was crowned @entity173			2
they finished third , going to show the distractions of other competitions and a daunting fixture list does n’t always shatter domestic form			0
fourteen years on , the @entity25 captain may settle for fourth and a few tears on his farewell for @entity181 , whether that is at @entity183 on may 24 or @entity184 in the @entity165 final on may 30			0
but their old nemesis @entity23 could , potentially , ruin both			0
@entity32 's team are live on television six times before the end of april – more than @entity25 ( 5 ) , @entity22 ( 4 ) , @entity26 ( 4 ) and @entity24 ( 2 ) – but that could suit those more inclined to schadenfreude			1
they 're fourth , but have been winning ugly , and most supporters sensed their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity70 last week was coming			0
with games against @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity22 before the curtain comes down in may , their fate is in their own hands			1
@entity200 is ' concerned ' , @entity199 deems them ' miserable ' , but again , points make prizes , no matter how you get them			0
if only those at @entity204 could have even a smidgen of the same consistency			0
@entity172 was crowned @entity173 in 2001 - the last time it was so tight in the table @entity23 's @entity209 and @entity25 's @entity172 pose with their awards in 2001 @entity25 manager @entity34 fielded a weakened side at the @entity130 in november and lost 1 - 0 @entity26 , led by a manager that abandoned @entity214 ’s in favour of a more likely @entity12 candidate in north @entity217 , have been hard done by when it comes to the top four			1
they qualified in 2010 , reaching the quarter - finals against @entity101 , before the heartbreak of 2012			0
@entity78 were crowned @entity12 champions that year , meaning @entity26 missed out on @entity43 football			2
in 2013 , too , they missed out by a single point to north @entity217 rivals @entity22			0
always the bridesmaid , never the bride , can become a familiar feeling			0
they can beat @entity78 5 - 3 yet lose 2 - 1 against @entity183			0
see off @entity22 2 - 1 but crumble 2 - 1 at @entity228			2
there or thereabouts ; almost , but not quite ; inconsistent			0
@entity37 's @entity26 remain in the running for @entity43 qualification but can be inconsistent @entity26 joined the race for the top four with help with in - form striker @entity236 ( centre ) none of the five sides going for those two spots have @entity12 distractions now , with @entity25 and @entity26 exiting the @entity167 on thursday			1
there is always next year to try again , and the race goes on domestically			0
so , come may 24 , there is the guarantee that each of @entity17 , @entity247 , @entity35 , @entity34 and @entity37 will either be reflecting on a job well done , or cursing what - ifs and maybes			0
for now , with four points between them and 12 weeks remaining , no amount of statistics can determine what order it will finish , no matter how hard we try			0
it ’s open season and the chase is on .			0

four points separate @entity22 in third and @entity26 in seventh
just once in @entity16 history has it been as tight by february ( 2001 )
@entity23 still have to play five of the current top seven clubs
@entity25 top the head - to - head table with 13 points from six matches
@entity24 have never finished in the top four of the @entity16
four years ago on *sunday* , @entity24 lost 1 - 0 against @entity94 in @entity93 in front of a 4,684 attendance at the @entity277
the @entity24 were in the top four for 18 weeks this season but are now fifth
@entity76 , @entity22 , @entity25 and @entity26 were among @entity7 's finest embarrassed in the @entity43 and @entity167 this week
