by @entity0 published : 17:38 est , 29 september 2012 updated : 03:16 est , 30 september 2012 the plane in which seven @entity5 died en route to @entity7 may have been critically overloaded when it crashed and burst into flames , a senior figure from the firm that operated the aircraft said last night			1
the admission from @entity11 ’s marketing director @entity10 came after he was shown a picture taken by a @entity14 photographer of the mound of rucksacks at the wreckage site			1
looking shocked as he studied the photograph , mr @entity10 said : ‘ personally i still believe it was a simple case of a bird strike , but it is possible that overloading played a part			0
’ overloaded ? : the picture of rucksacks and personal belongings found at the wreckage site in @entity27 victims : @entity30 , pictured left with his wife @entity32 , and @entity33 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity34 , were both killed in the plane crash that killed 19 people fireball : firefighters battle to douse the burning wreckage of a plane which crashed on the edge of the @entity27 capital , killing 19 people including seven @entity5 the tragedy has been blamed simply on the plane striking a bird of prey , possibly a vulture , at a height of 50ft as it took off from @entity50 in the @entity27 capital heading for @entity52 near @entity7			1
but experts have now cast doubt on whether that alone would have prevented the pilot from bringing the @entity57 back around for an emergency landing at the airport			0
the @entity14 picture adds to growing suspicions that the pilot allowed too many passengers with too much luggage aboard – which would have impaired the aircraft ’s ability to pull up out of danger			1
@entity69 government aviation minister @entity68 said that the combined weight of passengers and luggage carried by the plane would play a key part in the inquiry , which @entity5 investigators from the @entity77 will join this week			1
mr @entity68 said : ‘ we have taken the load factor seriously and the fact - finding committee will most certainly look into the matter			0
the exact cause of the crash is still unclear			0
tragic deaths : @entity5 @entity85 , left , and @entity86 , right , were both killed in the crash destroyed : the fire quickly spread to the rear of the plane , but the tail was still in one piece at the scene near the @entity94 on the south - west edge of @entity96 ‘ the bird strike may not be the sole reason behind the crash			1
’ and @entity100 , an experienced pilot with the @entity101 said : ‘ a bird hitting the plane should not be considered in isolation during the investigation			0
‘ several factors , such as technical maintenance , load , pressure on airline operators and many more , lead to an air crash			0
’ all those on board – including 12 people from @entity27 and @entity116 – died in the inferno when the twin - prop aircraft ploughed into a riverbank minutes after take off			1
the @entity5 , who arrived in @entity27 on wednesday and were due to begin trekking in the @entity120 on friday , were travelling with @entity122 - based company @entity121			1

traveller : @entity136 , 51 , from @entity137 in @entity138 , died in the crash ‘ he had done a lot of work with @entity161 taking youngsters on @entity164 activities			2
’ mr @entity86 ’s wife , @entity165 , 54 , wept as she said he ‘ died doing something he always wanted to do			2
’ mr @entity33 , an @entity168 - educated lawyer , lived with girlfriend @entity169 in @entity139 and worked at international law firm @entity170			0
miss @entity169 said yesterday they had planned to marry and she had lost her ‘ soulmate ’			0
she added : ‘ my whole world has been turned upside down			0
’ relatives in @entity5 are likely to face a harrowing wait before their loved ones ’ remains can be identified and returned home			2
the pathologist conducting post-mortems and trying to identify the badly charred bodies said the process could take several days using a combination of dna samples , dental records and matching personal jewellery			0
professor @entity186 of @entity187 described the task as ‘ one of the most difficult i ’ve dealt with			0
’ he said families in the @entity5 had already been sent identification forms on which they list distinctive items of jewellery and consent to dental checks			2
