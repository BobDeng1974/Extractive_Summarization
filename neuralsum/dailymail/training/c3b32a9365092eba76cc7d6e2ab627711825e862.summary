@entity0 firmly denied having any part in @entity2 or altering balls in a press conference thursday afternoon			1
' when i pick those footballs out , at that point , to me , they 're perfect , ' he said			2
' i do n't want anyone touching my balls after that			1
i do n't want anyone rubbing them , you know , putting any air in them , taking any air out			1
to me , those balls are perfect and that 's what i expect when i show up on the field			1
' and while he said he did not know of anyone on his team lowering the pressure in any of the game balls , he said while he could not deny that anything happened as he was busy preparing for the game and did not see everything that went on , he talked to the team 's equipment staff who said they did not adjust the pressure in the balls			1
' they also know how i like the balls and i tell them how great they are , ' he said of the staff			2
i would never break the rules , ' @entity0 told the press meanwhile , teammates who spoke with @entity51 said he told members of the @entity46 in a closed door meeting earlier in the day that he liked his balls ' a certain way			1
' ' i feel like i have always played within the rules			0
i would never break the rules , ' @entity0 told the press			1
' i was as surprised as anybody when i heard monday morning what was happening			2
' @entity0 also made it very clear that he believes the @entity46 won ' fair and square ' in their 45 - 7 rout of the @entity63 last sunday in the afc championship game			1
@entity0 also stressed this was not as serious as everyone has been making it out to be these past few days , noting ; ' this is n't @entity69 , no one 's dying , we 'll get through this			1
' the @entity73 seems to feel the same way too , with @entity0 revealing investigators have not even reached out to him			1
some members of the press were shocked however when @entity0 said he would not even be able to notice the difference in ball pressure while playing as he is only focused on the game			1
' everybody has a preference			0
some guys like them round			0
some guys like them thin			0
some guys like them tacky			0
some guys like them brand new			0
some guys like old balls , ' he explained			2
he also says he checks the leather , laces and tack of the ball before games , but never squeezes them			0
' i think there ’s a lot of people who have more information than me , ' said the two - time @entity103			0
' i have questions , too			0
' he later said ; ' the integrity of the sport is very important			0
' @entity0 ( shown practicing on thursday ) hinted at his possible involvement in @entity2 thursday afternoon as he told members of the @entity46 in a closed door meeting that he liked his balls ' a certain way ' meanwhile , the eternally gruff and forever short @entity41 addressed the media thursday morning and kept it simple , saying he was ' shocked ' to learn that 11 of his team 's 12 balls were underinflated and that he never even touches game balls , let alone knows anything about ' football air pressure			1
' @entity41 had told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to @entity0			1
' i think we all know that quarterbacks , kickers , specialists have certain preferences on footballs			0
they know a lot more about it than i do			0
they 're a lot more sensitive to it than i am , ' he explained			0
' i hear them comment on it from time to time , but i can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject			0
@entity0 's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than i can possibly provide			1
' he then added ; ' in my entire coaching career , i have never talked to any player or staff member about football air pressure , ' said @entity41			1
he also said he would be sure to keep the balls on the higher end of the inflation scale moving forward to make sure this does not happen again			2
' obviously , with our footballs being inflated to the 12.5 - pound range , any deflation would then take us under that specification limit , ' he said			0
' knowing that now , in the future , we will certainly inflate the footballs above that low level to account for any possible change during the game			0
' the conference ended , in typical @entity41 style , with the coaching great giving the same response to every question asked by the press ; ' i 've told you everything i know			1
' if , for any reason , anyone on the @entity46 is found to have anything to do with sunday 's underinflated balls , they would face up to a $ 25,000 fine this as @entity0 and @entity41 prepare to face the @entity181 on february 1 in their record sixth @entity103 appearance			1
the @entity181 , the reigning @entity103 champions , have remained somewhat quiet about the recent controversy , though the team 's cornerback @entity184 did say of @entity0 while speaking to the press on wednesday ; ' i think people somehow get a skewed view of @entity0 that he is just a clean - cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise			1
' also making comments about brady was @entity181 quarterback @entity197 , who was far more complimentary than his teammate			0
' he ’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game , one of the greatest at least , ' said @entity197			2
' i just think that he ’s as good as it gets and watching him play the game of football is truly spectacular			2
' ' i think people somehow get a skewed view of @entity0 that he is just a clean - cut does everything right and never says a bad word to anyone - and we know him to be otherwise , ' said @entity181 cornerback @entity184 ( above with @entity0 after a 2012 game ) ' he ’s the greatest quarterback to ever play the game , ' said @entity181 quarterback @entity197 ( above at practice on thursday ) of @entity0 if , for any reason , anyone on the @entity46 is found to have anything to do with sunday 's underinflated balls , they would face up to a $ 25,000 fine			1
as for @entity41 , the incident has many referencing his previous discipline from the league in 2007 when it was discovered that he had sent someone to record the defensive signals used by the @entity223			2
it is worth nothing however , that while 11 of 12 balls were underinflated by two pounds , they were adjusted at halftime when the score was 17 - 7 in favor of the @entity46			2
with the balls in the acceptable range in the second half , the @entity46 outscored the @entity63 28 - 0 meaning that should anyone on the @entity46 have been involved this would have ultimately proven to be a high risk situation with a very , very low reward			0
then , there is what @entity239 , a professor of physics at @entity241 , had to tell @entity243 about the possibility no one did anything to the balls and it was just simple physics			0
' if they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount , and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower , that would drop the @entity255 by between 1 and 2 , ' @entity239 explained .			0

@entity41 addressed the @entity2 scandal thursday morning saying he was ' shocked ' to learn team 's balls were underinflated on sunday
@entity41 also said he knows nothing about ' football air pressure ' and never even touches game balls
quarterback @entity0 said at his own press conference at *4:30pm* , ' i pick the balls i like and i do n't want anyone else to touch them '
@entity0 also admitted he spoke to the equipment staff and they had nothing to do with changing the pressure in the balls
@entity73 investigators also have not even contacted the quarterback he revealed , as he *downplayed* the scandal saying ; ' this is n't @entity69 '
