by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 30 september 2013 number one fan : @entity4 's chancellor of the exchequer @entity3 leaves the conference hall with his wife @entity6 following his his keynote speech @entity4 faces seven more years of austerity in public spending – but will reap the reward in the shape of tax cuts after the next election , @entity3 said yesterday			1
the chancellor used a confident conference speech to announce that he aims to put the public finances back in the black by 2020			2
mr @entity3 said a @entity19 government would aim to run a budget surplus by that stage – a strategy adopted by countries such as @entity24 and @entity25 to prepare themselves better for financial shocks			1
following his pledge yesterday to make thousands of long - term unemployed work for their benefits , he said he would rewrite his fiscal mandate so the @entity33 achieved an absolute surplus in the next @entity35 , provided the recovery was sustained			0
at the same time , capital spending – on new roads , rail and broadband , for example – would grow , meaning intense new pressure on day - to - day @entity44 spending			0
economists said it would mean overall public spending effectively being frozen in real terms for a decade , between 2010 and 2020 , and a significant retreat of the size of the state			1
in a speech that borrowed rhetorical flourishes from @entity54 and @entity55 , the chancellor drew a critical electoral dividing line with his pledge to go further than current government plans for paying off the structural deficit			0
this would allow him to start paying off @entity4 ’s national debt , which is on course to reach £ 1.4trillion by the next election – rather than just the deficit , effectively the nation ’s credit card			1
the chancellor gave a strong signal that he favours tax cuts , however , telling the conference : ‘ together we are going to share in the rewards			2
’ recalling the @entity33 ’ slogan that @entity77 did n’t ‘ fix the roof when the sun was shining ’ , by running a budget deficit even in its boom years , mr @entity3 declared : ‘ let us never make that same mistake again			1
‘ when we ’ve dealt with @entity77 ’s deficit , we will have a surplus in good times as insurance against difficult times ahead			2
provided the recovery is sustained , our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next @entity35			0
‘ if we want to protect those things we care about , like generous pensions and decent healthcare , and buy the best equipment for the brave men and women who fight in our @entity110 , all of us are going to have to confront the costs of modern government – and cap working - age welfare bills			0
and only if we properly control public expenditure will we be able to keep lowering taxes for hard - working people in a way that lasts			0
@entity119 , of the @entity120 , said : ‘ if you do n’t want to put taxes up , then you could go for flat public spending – freezing it in real terms for two more years to 2020			1
that would mean we ’ve had ten years of no growth in public spending			2
if people are expecting the next parliament to be a couple of years more austerity and then lots of giveaways , then they are going to be disappointed			0
‘ obviously , there is a benefit in having a lower deficit – you have lower debt interest payments , you get debt down quicker , you have more flexibility			0
’ mr @entity119 said the extension of austerity would lead to new questions about the viability of the government ’s ring - fences on areas of spending including the @entity146 , schools and foreign aid , which have meant deeper cuts elsewhere			1
@entity151 spokesman @entity150 said the chancellor could not be trusted after pledging earlier to run a budget surplus from 2015			0
‘ @entity3 promised in 2010 that by the time of the next election in 2015 he would balance the books completely ; we would n’t have a deficit at all and it turns out we ’re going to end up with a £ 96billion deficit			1
so he ’s promising something he should have delivered in 2015			0
’ welfare : mr @entity3 accused @entity77 of allowing people to linger on benefits for years - with no questions asked			1

chancellor said @entity4 will reap rewards through tax breaks after election
admitted public *sector* spending would be ' frozen ' for a decade
austerity in public spending will help pay off £ 1.4trillion debt
