by @entity1 reporter published : 15:07 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 15:08 est , 11 october 2012 as the presidential race intensifies , both camps have been known to play dirty - but one stunt this week has taken things far too literally			2
campaign volunteers at the @entity9 @entity8 headquarters arrived for work on tuesday to be greeted by a large mound of horse manure dumped in front of their office			1
no one has owned up to the stunt which happened sometime after 10pm on monday at the headquarters north of @entity19			2
political stink : @entity22 volunteers arrived at party headquarters in @entity9 on tuesday to be greeted by a large pile of horse manure @entity27 @entity8 chair @entity26 told @entity28 local 12 : ' it ’s really unfortunate that people ca n’t have respectful disagreements			2
' we ’re not going to be discouraged by it			0
it ’s just very disappointing			0
it will probably motivate our people even more but it ’s also a very disrespectful thing to do			0
' a report was filed by the party with the @entity27 sheriff ’s department and the building 's security footage was being examined , ms @entity26 said			0
the landlord of the property was left to clean up the mess			0
it is the second incidence of vandalism in the name of politics this week - but in this incidence loyalties lay on the other side			0
vandalism : someone spray - painted over the name of @entity55 , @entity56 and replaced it with ' @entity58 ' the tiny community of @entity55 , @entity56 was hit by an aggressive supporter of @entity58 who took it upon himself to deface the sign marking its location			1
@entity55 has no known affiliation to @entity65 presidential candidate @entity55			1
but that ( fairly obvious ) fact clearly did not deter the anonymous vandal who wrote ' @entity58 ' on the town sign			1
battle : supporters of both @entity55 ( left ) and @entity58 have adopted some rather odd tactics to show their support to candidates			1

@entity75 wrote ' @entity58 ' over town sign for @entity55 , @entity56 on tuesday in another case of *election* rage
