at the time , the wife of the 9th @entity4 , said : ' @entity9 seemed such a nice chap			1
everyone deserves fair treatment as far as i 'm concerned ' in 1997 , @entity9 was in the headlines when lady @entity29 took pity on him when she saw him begging near her estate , @entity31 , in @entity32			1
the wife of the @entity4 found him work and a roof over his head , but he repaid her kindness weeks later by running away with @entity37 schoolgirl @entity36			0
the 16 - year - old , whose millionaire @entity40 academic father lived in the @entity7 , professed her enduring love for @entity9 , saying she would rather they be homeless together than agree to her horrified family ’s wishes and end the relationship			1
he fathered a son , @entity46 , with @entity36 before leaving her for another teenager , @entity47 , months later , going on to wed dental nurse @entity48			0
but the marriage ended in dramatic fashion , with @entity9 jailed for three and a half years in 2007 for brutally assaulting her following the break - up			1
the judge at the time said @entity9 was ‘ prone to abusive behaviour with partners and i agree that anyone in a relationship with you is at risk ’			1

the @entity4 himself is a conservationist who has campaigned to preserve rural areas and various historic buildings the lover this time , a mother of two from @entity73 , @entity74 , spent five months in a ‘ slightly avant garde ’ relationship with @entity9 , during which they ‘ indulged in an adventurous sex life ’ where role - playing reached new levels , @entity69 was told			1
defence barrister @entity79 told the judge : ‘ mr @entity9 is a colourful character who in the old days had a @entity82 experience			2
’ describing the latest relationship , he said : ‘ things had become more @entity20 and there was some unacceptable violence and he has pleaded guilty to that			0

past : in 1997 @entity9 ( left ) ran away with @entity37 schoolgirl @entity36 ( right ) - the 16 - year - old daughter of a millionaire @entity40 professor but she was woken by a blow to her face and he was standing over her			1
‘ his hand was clenched around her throat and she could barely breathe , ’ mr @entity88 said			0
‘ she could not push him off and he grabbed her hair			0
‘ he made various threats to beat her up , hit her again and told her he knew people in prison who would cut her up			2
he brandished a @entity110 knife in her face			0
’ the terrified woman ’s children , aged between six and nine , were in the house			0
the court heard @entity9 had four previous convictions for ‘ offences against the person ’ and now lives in a caravan on a farm in @entity120 , @entity121 , where he works as a labourer			2

you are a bullying , controlling , unpleasant man			0
