this is the touching yet awkward moment nine pairs of students were asked to kiss on camera - despite having never met before			1
the clip shows the 18 pupils greet each other for the first time followed by a few seconds of small talk before they go in for their first embrace and snog			2
despite having a reputation for being promiscuous on student nights , the shy smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers - one lady even walks away mid-smooch			2
however , the way the @entity37 students react is somewhat more awkward than their @entity39 counterparts			1
station manager @entity40 was on hand to help out with producing and editing the @entity37 clip , but declined to take part			0
will , a third year @entity48 student , said : ' when @entity27 came to me with the idea for the shoot , i really wanted to get involved with the project			0
@entity50 to meet you : two strangers prepare to kiss as part of a @entity22 student 's project it was n't that bad ! the footage shows the pair kissing , left , and their reactions after their first smooch , right well , this is awkward ! one of the female students does n't look too happy about the prospect of snogging a stranger - although he looked pretty happy about it off they go ! the pair embrace but the girl still looks less than impressed afterwards and grimaces , right ready ? despite having a reputation for being promiscuous , the awkward smiles and laughs clearly show these students are not accustomed to kissing strangers hands on : this couple seem to be enjoying their first - ever kiss despite initial awkwardness how did he find it ? this young man 's body language suggests he found the whole process uncomfortable ' it was quite a tense atmosphere in the studio - a lot of the participants were n’t at home in front of the camera which may have been a bit daunting			1
' i was asked to star in the video but i said no. all the students were volunteers , who knew exactly what they would be asked to do			2
' it was great fun , and the footage we got was really heart - warming			0
their reactions are so human			0
' hello there ! the video , which these two students star in , was produced by the @entity22 tv station tender : the duo get stuck into their kiss and the woman even manages to place a hand on her partner 's arm round two ? the girl seemingly makes a mad dash but her partner looks ready for more getting into it : nine pairs of strangers , including these two men , were asked to kiss on camera reaction : one of the men looks happy about his first kiss with the stranger , who looks downtrodden the video is a tribute to a similar idea by @entity39 filmmaker @entity29 who filmed 20 models meeting and kissing for the first time			1
but the @entity22 students steal the show with their sheer awkwardness , firmly putting to bed the rumour that students are well - versed in kissing strangers			1
one girl even walks off mid-way through the kiss , while most of the pairs ended up just smiling and laughing about the whole ordeal			2
preparing : a spokesperson for student newspaper @entity153 said : ' nobody knows where to put their hands at any point ' but this couple seem to , right something funny ? the couple seem to find their first kiss hilarious she does n't look too happy about it ! this woman seems a little reluctant to get stuck in awkward ? the female student still seems hesitant mid-kiss , while the man just ca n't let go another girl complimented her new partner , by saying ' not bad ' after their first embrace			1
a spokesperson for student newspaper @entity153 said : ' nobody knows where to put their hands at any point			0
' some of the people seemed way too keen to get their tongue in there , and from our experience it is n’t actually that shocking to ask a student to make out with a complete stranger , it happens all the time			0
' before and after : it seems a random smooch was n't so bad for this pair , whose hands linger after locking lips @entity194 natural : some of the couples make the whole experience look easy oh no ! this chap does n't look too happy about having to kissed a stranger woah ! the chap may have got stuck into it but his female counterpart looks somewhat shocked			0
