@entity9 @entity8 , 29 , molested the 14 - year - old on two consecutive days - once after she called him in tears when she was been bitten by a dog			1
@entity18 , a teaching assistant at a high school in west @entity15 who competed at the @entity17 , was first contacted by the girl on @entity20 ' as a dare '			1
they began messaging , innocently to begin with but became sexual and they exchanged mobile phone numbers , @entity24 heard			2
sempers suggested they meet up on 26 april last year and they went to a car park in @entity27 where they kissed and touched each other			2
when the girl said she did not want sex because she was too young , @entity8 replied : ' i 'll wait			1
' the next day the student messaged @entity18 saying she had been attacked by the dog , and the two met again - this time at an @entity36 carpark at @entity37			1
they ended up in the the backseat of his car where @entity8 assaulted her			1
after the girl confided in her friends , her school and social services received anonymous phone calls from a worried parent expressing concerns about @entity18 ' relationship with the girl			2
last month @entity18 pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child under 16 just a day after a jury had been sworn in to try him			2
jailing @entity18 , judge @entity0 said : ' it 's important to understand that you have a position of responsibility as a teaching assistant			1
' i bear in mind the fact that initially in 2011 you had been involved involved in , and i accept that there was no ill will , @entity20 contact with several girls			2
the @entity5 athlete , pictured speaking after the @entity70 combined events in @entity71 , admitted indulging in sexual activity with a schoolgirl @entity18 , pictured competing at the @entity74 where he finished in 6th place with a score of 7503 points , was initially contacted by the girl on @entity20 as a dare ' it is also accepted that the complainant contacted you as a dare , but it is perfectly clear you had opportunities to say to her do not contact me again			1
' instead you carried on and entered in a conversation over a period of time which led to the contact with this young girl			0
meeting one was arranged and ended with what can only be described as a passionate kiss			0
' the young girl said that she did n't want to have sex but you , in text form , and in my judgement very arrogantly , said ' i 'll wait			0
' ' the second occasion i accept you did not initiate			0
you went into the back seat ( of your car ) at your behest , you took off her shirt and lay on the top of her			0
but the 29 - year - old , pictured in 2010 at the @entity70 combined events in @entity71 , arranged to meet up with the girl and went onto molest her over two days ' i accept to a limited degree that you may have taken the matter further			1
there was a gross breach of trust here - this girl was undoubtedly highly vulnerable and impressionable			0
' you knew full well you should not have contacted her and in my judgement there was an element of grooming			0
perhaps your vanity and desire encouraged you to go ahead			0
@entity8 had narrowly missed out on a bronze when he represented @entity127 at the @entity17 in 2010 the decathlete managed a personal best of 3,968 points on the first day of competition , which put him into fourth place going into the final day but the second day , @entity8 performance dropped and he eventually came in fifth place ' it is perfectly clear that this is entirely of your own making			0
those who prey on young girls will undoubtedly receive an immediate custodial sentence of some duration			0

he claimed he admitted the offence so his victim would not suffer the ordeal of testifying in court , it was said			0
