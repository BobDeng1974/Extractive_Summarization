by @entity0 @entity1 may have suffered a surprise third - round exit at the @entity4 - which he won last year - but his dedicated girlfriend @entity5 still looked chic supporting her long - term boyfriend courtside			1
@entity5 , who we are more accustomed to seeing in feminine floral dresses , shook up her style today with a more boho - inspired outfit			0
miss @entity12 , @entity1 's girlfriend of eight years , grinned widely as she made her way to her seat to watch the 27 - year - old play , wearing on - trend £ 39.99 @entity19 print shorts from @entity20 and a floaty monochrome top			1
courtside chic : @entity5 , girlfriend of @entity1 , looked super stylish as she arrived to watch his match against @entity23 in their @entity22 on day four of the @entity4 at @entity25 - sadly , he lost she was armed with her new favourite handbag , the £ 1,395 @entity27 and @entity28 by @entity29			1
@entity30 and @entity31 are also lucky enough to own the luxurious handbag in black			0
@entity5 was seen giggling with @entity1 's new coach , @entity34 , herself a former @entity35 champion , who was in the front row at @entity25 , @entity37 , a few seats down from @entity5			1
she also wore her favourite £ 55 @entity40 from @entity42 charm bracelet , which could well be a good luck charm considering she 's only ever spotted wearing it at @entity1 's matches			2
sadly , it did n't work its magic today			0
mixing high street with high - end : @entity5 teamed her £ 39.99 @entity20 shorts with a £ 1,395 @entity51 tote from @entity29 tanned and toned : @entity5 showcased her tanned legs as she arrived at the @entity25 looking cheerful oh no ! she also wore her favourite @entity42 charm bracelet , which could well be a god luck charm considering she 's only ever spotted wearing it at @entity1 's matches			1
sadly , it did n't work its magic today the manner of @entity1 's 7 - 6 ( 12 - 10 ) 6 - 2 defeat by @entity59 @entity23 will not help bolster his confidence ahead of @entity35 , which kicks off in just ten days			1
he squandered eight set points in the opening set before tamely surrendering the second			0
the defeat broke the world number five 's 19 - match winning streak on grass , a sequence that started in 2012 with his @entity71 gold in @entity37			2
new coach @entity34 kept a poker face as the match headed towards a disappointing conclusion but she would have noted the challenge that lies ahead before @entity1 opens @entity77 proceedings at the @entity78 on june 23			0
@entity79 : @entity5 was seen giggling with @entity1 's new coach , @entity34 , herself a former @entity35 champion chatting away : @entity5 and new coach @entity34 had a quick catch - up prior to the match fancy seeing you here ! @entity1 's girlfriend @entity5 , ( left ) has a laugh with his coach @entity34 before his match against @entity23 @entity1 's dropshots were off target , often falling short of the net , his backhands kept misfiring and there seemed to be a never - ending stream of forehand errors flying off his racket			1
if such errors prove costly against a player he had beaten in five of their six previous meetings , @entity1 's chances of overcoming rivals such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 at the grasscourt major look rather perilous			2
a year after completing a @entity35 double , the @entity108 was strangely off - colour as he allowed @entity23 to steal the opening set with a delightful cross-court volley			0
any hopes of a @entity1 revival fell flat early in the second set when he surrendered the opening game with a forehand error and @entity23 made sure he made the most of his chances			0
the wily @entity59 , who at times gave @entity1 the runaround , sealed an impressive victory when his opponent sliced a backhand into the net on match point , leaving the crowd stunned and the home favourite frustrated			2
' when you play the best in the world you have to come up with the best ... they bring the best out of you and it was a great win for me , ' @entity23 said courtside after setting up a quarter - final with @entity138 @entity137 .			0

@entity5 wore £ 39.99 @entity20 shorts with monochrome *blouse*
carried new @entity144 tote , which costs £ 1,395
*shared* some laughs with @entity1 's new coach @entity147 before the match
sadly @entity1 suffered surprise third - round exit at the @entity4
suffered 7 - 6 ( 10 ) 6 - 2 defeat by @entity59 @entity23
