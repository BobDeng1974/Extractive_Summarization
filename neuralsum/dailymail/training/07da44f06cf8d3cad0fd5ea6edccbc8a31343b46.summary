by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 04:33 est , 14 march 2014 @entity3 's shadow chancellor @entity2 said he would scrap the married tax allowance after the election @entity3 will scrap the @entity6 ’ ‘ perverse and unfair ’ new £ 1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples , @entity2 announced last night			1
the shadow @entity10 said a @entity3 government would reverse the government ’s proposal to restore recognition for the institution in the tax system , and spend the money to help fund a reintroduction of the 10p tax rate			1
work and pensions secretary @entity20 , the staunchest champion of marriage in the @entity22 , condemned the announcement			1
‘ @entity3 scrapped support for marriage when they were last in government - penalising stable families , ’ mr @entity20 told the @entity24			1
‘ and here they go again - same old @entity3 - with yet another example of making decent people pay more in taxes			1
‘ conservatives support marriage because it is a vital institution which underpins stable families			1
we support strong relationships , which we know offer children the best start in life			0
’ married couples where one person earns under the £ 10,000 income tax threshold will be allowed to transfer £ 1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £ 200 from april 2015			2
only the 24 million basic rate taxpayers will benefit , though @entity46 has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a @entity6 majority			0
polls show overwhelming support for the new allowance , though it is opposed by both @entity3 and the @entity51			1
a recent @entity53 poll found that 62 per cent of people back the idea , with just 20 per cent against			0
mr @entity2 told the @entity56 last night that the tax break would only benefit a third of married couples , and one in six families with children , and declared he would scrap it if he is chancellor after the 2015 election			1
assessing mr @entity63 's tax policies ahead of next week 's @entity64 he said : ‘ personally , i think that first of all , @entity63 should first of all admit the 50p tax cut at the top was a big mistake			0
‘ but i also think , any tax cut for families on middle and low incomes is better than none			1
' what did he actually announce last year , he said that he would introduce a married couples allowance which , when you look at the detail , only goes to a third of married couples , and one in six families with children , it goes mainly to men			0
' mr @entity2 , pictured dancing with wife @entity83 , said the tax break would only benefit a third of married couples @entity86 was under mounting pressure last night to ease the 40p tax burden on the middle classes			0
the chancellor is expected to reject calls for a significant increase to the threshold in next week ’s budget , after figures showed millions more are being sucked into the higher rate tax			2
but they are facing growing demands to help the 1.4million workers who have been sucked into the 40p band since 2010 , with mps arguing many of these people are on middling incomes			0
official figures show that the top 25 per cent of earners – anyone on £ 33,717 or more – will pay 75 per cent of the country ’s total £ 167billion of income tax this year			0
by contrast , the bottom half will pay less than 10 per cent			0
when the @entity112 came to power in may 2010 the starting salary for higher rate tax stood at just £ 43,875			0
if @entity63 had allowed the 40p tax band to rise in line with inflation it would now not kick in until a worker reached a salary of £ 50,000 , according to calculations by accountants @entity124			1
mr @entity2 went on : ‘ we think what we should actually do is scrap the married couples allowance which is perverse and unfair , and use that money to give a tax cut for all middle and lower income families			1
‘ we propose a new 10p starting rate of income tax			2
it 's better than the personal allowance , because it 's better for work incentives , it would help two - thirds of married couples , it would help women as well as men , families with children			0
‘ let 's cut taxes for working families , and let 's ease this cost - of - living crisis rather than carrying on pandering to @entity149 backbenchers with tax cuts that are unfair and do n't make sense			2
’ the shadow chancellor also admitted being ‘ daunted ’ by the prospect of being in @entity154 after the election with further efforts to cut the deficit necessary			1
asked how he would respond to the @entity149 charge that voters should not ‘ give the keys back to the guy who crashed the car ’ , mr @entity2 added : ‘ all of us in our lives get things right , but all of us make some mistakes , and the last @entity3 government did n't regulate the financial services in a tough enough way			2
‘ but we 've learnt from that and we 'll come in not just with experience , not just some wisdom which comes from that experience , but with utter determination to make this country fairer and stronger for the future			0
’ a government source said scrapping the marriage tax allowance would save under £ 500 million a year , a fraction of the £ 2 billion a year cost of introducing a new 10p tax band covering the first £ 1,000 of earnings			1
‘ once again @entity2 ’ sums simply do n’t add up			0
his latest gimmick would mean £ 1.5 billion more spending , more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it , ’ the source said			0
‘ nothing changes – it ’s the same old @entity3 with no long - term economic plan to secure a better future for @entity193			2
’ @entity3 has previously suggested it would also use the proceeds of a new mansion tax on properties worth £ 2 million or more to fund a 10p rate			1
@entity199 scrapped the 10p rate in his last budget , and all those who used to pay it now pay no tax at all because of the coalition ’s new £ 10,000 tax threshold .			2
