@entity1 's @entity0 have it all to do in the second leg of this @entity4 qualifier after @entity5 nabbed an all - important away goal and earned a 1 - 1 draw in @entity8			1
@entity5 , competing in the @entity4 for the first time in more than 15 years , had @entity1 on the brink of elimination but the former @entity13 and @entity14 manager was given hope by a second - half equaliser from @entity18 striker @entity17			1
that was after @entity21 's composed finish in the first gave @entity5 the lead against a shadow of a @entity0 side the 60,000 fans at the @entity27 are used to seeing			1
@entity5 should have punished the home side 27 minutes in when an in - swinging corner found an unmarked @entity69 , but the defender failed to place his header beyond goalkeeper @entity48			2
that was soon forgotten when they took a deserved lead four minutes from the break			0
a surging @entity103 run down the right saw the midfielder square the ball to @entity21 who , 10 yards out and with defenders approaching , was the epitome of cool			0
a first touch to set himself and a second to pass it into the bottom - right corner , the attacker made it 1 - 0			2
half time arrived , and @entity0 had failed to register a single shot on target			1
in a competition where away goals come at twice the price , a change was needed			0
yet @entity1 decided against making a substitute , leaving season - long loan - signing @entity53 from @entity126 to look on from the bench for the time being			1
catch me if you can : @entity58 looked off the pace for the majority of the game but scored the equaliser celebration : @entity58 saved @entity0 's blushes in the 1 - 1 draw after competing for @entity18 at the @entity138 saved : the @entity18 striker must now go to @entity140 with @entity0 needing to score against @entity5 to survive the tie click here to read the match report from @entity145 's @entity4 qualifying play - off match against @entity146 it was @entity148 - born @entity58 who saved @entity0 's blushes as the striker , with three defenders for company , squeezed his shot away into the far corner to make it 1 - 1			1
the relief was there for all to see			0
the home side should have made it 2 - 1 less than five minutes later when @entity59 , having beaten the offside trap , only had @entity68 between him and goal			2
yet the midfielder only sent his shot wide			0
@entity53 came on and could have made himself an instant hero , only to pass to a marked @entity58 instead of slotting the ball home from less than 10 yards out			2
it was the strangest of decisions from the 28 - year - old with the goal gaping			0
@entity0 began to look more like the home side that had lost just two @entity172 games in 29 at this venue , but could not find a way past a determined @entity68 in the @entity5 goal			0
the game returns for the second leg in @entity140 this wednesday			0
making a point : @entity1 must travel to @entity140 with his @entity0 side and score against @entity5 as it stands at 1 - 1 happy with that ? @entity5 return to @entity140 with the advantage after their first @entity4 game in 15 years			1

@entity1 's @entity0 draw 1 - 1 with @entity5 at the @entity27
*bilbao* take away goal to second leg this wednesday thanks to @entity21
@entity18 striker @entity58 equalised in second half after @entity0 failed to register a single shot on target during dire first 45 minutes
@entity126 loan signing @entity53 came on and could have scored - only to make *bizarre* decision and pass instead of shooting at gaping goal
