with the @entity2 campaign so nearly upon us but many issues still lingering and parts untested , it 's time to take an @entity7 check			2
here , @entity9 's @entity8 assesses the positives , negatives and what the omen could be for the main contenders this season			1
@entity16 reasons to be cheerful : after the moans of last season about not having a striker , @entity18 has landed @entity22 , one of the most effective frontmen in @entity24 over the past couple of seasons			1
main man : @entity22 could the answer to @entity16 's attacking problems of the last few seasons in form : @entity22 has hit the ground running during pre-season and will be expected to continue in the league reasons to be fearful : a season without a trophy means @entity18 is already under increased pressure			1
he has been backed with funds and needs to deliver			0
it is also worth keeping an eye on @entity43			0
he was brilliant last season , but at some point age will win			2
what 's happened over the summer : @entity16 have seemingly plugged the biggest gap in their armour by signing @entity22 , but more to the point they also landed @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , without any last - minute rushing around			1
they look to be in extremely good shape			0
what the manager says : ‘ we have the squad that we want to have			0
it is a squad for tomorrow , for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people			2
so i like my squad very much			0
’ one to watch : costa			0
he was the missing link last season			2
if he does what he ’s been brought in to do then @entity16 will be the only club that can match @entity66			1
@entity67 : last time @entity50 made his debut in @entity71 , his club won the league title ( even if he did n’t play a league game )			1
look who 's back : former @entity75 midfielder @entity50 is back in @entity76 after a spell with @entity78 @entity66 reason to be cheerful : the champions look to be in excellent shape			1
they have the best starting xi and probably the best squad , as well			0
the signing of @entity86 for £ 32m from @entity87 means they also achieved their no 1 summer objective of landing a world - class centre - back			1
reason to be fearful : their @entity93 penalty limits their @entity95 squad to only 21 players			0
@entity98 ’s side also have a tough early schedule against @entity16 , @entity100 and @entity75 in their opening six games			1
what 's happened over the summer : @entity103 had the mother of all tantrums because he did n’t get a birthday cake , some unwanted players were offloaded and @entity66 managed to spend about £ 50m			2
@entity109 ’s arrival will have also riled plenty down south			0
controversial : @entity109 made the shock decision to join @entity66 after leaving @entity16 what the manager says : ‘ we 've had a lot of problems with @entity93 but we bought some very important players			1
i do n't know what the difference is between @entity120 and @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , or @entity126 and @entity127			0
’ one to watch : @entity120			0
with @entity129 ’s arrival , can he hold on to his place ? @entity121 did n’t look particularly impressive in the @entity131 , but there has always been the feeling that @entity98 has his doubts about the @entity71 no 1			1
@entity67 : all bar one of @entity66 ’s @entity2 games fall before @entity103 ’s birthday			0
they have ample time to plan			0
@entity140 reasons to be cheerful : they have a manager who , unlike @entity144 , has the confidence to know he belongs at the club			1
to judge from pre-season , that confidence seems to have spread through the squad			0
in @entity151 , they have also signed a quality midfielder			0
one to watch : @entity151 ( right ) has impressed for @entity140 during pre-season reasons to be fearful : this squad needed major surgery and so far they have only signed three players , with the £ 30m spent on @entity158 held up as an example of the club badly overspending			1
the defence needs significant reinforcements			0
what ’s happened over the summer : regime change and the spread of hope among fans and staff that last season ’s debacle was a one - off			1
what the manager says : ‘ every club where i have been , i have struggled for the first three months			0
after that , they know what i want : how i am as a human being and also a manager , because i am very direct			0
i say things as they are , so you have to adapt to that way of coaching			0
it 's not so easy			0
’ one to watch : @entity184			0
in @entity186 ’s new formation he is likely to get to play behind the strikers rather than out wide			0
that should better utilise the talents of one of @entity24 ’s best players			0
@entity67 : @entity186 has won the league title with all four of the club sides he has managed			2
reputation : @entity196 has won the league title with all four club sides he has managed @entity75 reasons to be cheerful : @entity200 has started spending money and it looks as though he has done it well and early			1
@entity204 is a genuinely world - class player , adding to an already impressive attack , and they have also built on their defence			1
reasons to be fearful : @entity210 is not a world - class striker , merely a good one , and they have n’t many alternatives for the centre - forward role should he suffer an injury or loss of form			1
@entity204 or @entity218 might have to be reallocated to cover			1
what ’s happened this summer : the squad has got stronger all round			0
@entity222 is an excellent defender with the apparent maturity for @entity200 to convert him to centre - half			2
they still lack the depth of @entity66 or @entity16			1
shining light : @entity75 have splashed the cash again this summer , signing @entity204 for £ 30m what the manager says : ‘ there are six or seven teams who are genuine contenders for the @entity2			1
you only assess the contenders once the window closes			2
i 'm happy with the players we 've signed			0
i could still do something , i wo n't rule it out			0
numbers wise we are maybe a bit short in certain areas , but the depth of the squad is very good			0
i 'm very excited by this group			0
’ one to watch : @entity246			0
@entity204 is the star of the team , but @entity246 was consistently brilliant last season			1
who knows what might have happened in the title race had he avoided injury			2
@entity67 : @entity75 were the first @entity253 winners to lift the @entity131 since 2009			1
a special vintage , perhaps ? back on the right path : @entity200 has lifted the last two trophies on offer in @entity71 @entity100 reason to be cheerful : the club is spending money – roughly £ 100m , in fact - and really backing @entity262			1
@entity263 is arguably the country ’s most exciting talent and @entity262 has @entity100 playing beautiful football			1
reason to be fearful : it ’s impossible to know how the new signings will bed in , which in turn will dictate how heavily the club miss @entity272			1
plus , it ’s hugely unfortunate that @entity274 got injured just four days after arriving			0
what 's happened over the summer : they sold @entity277 and bought the * * * fill in with name of good or terrible music group depending on success of multiple new signings * * * what the manager says : ‘ last season was a great step forward and now we must believe that we can go one better			2
there is only an excitement and a belief inside the club that we can challenge again for the title			2
’ one to watch : @entity263			1
a wonderful talent who could flourish into a world - class player			2
@entity67 : @entity295 signed half a planet ’s worth of player after selling @entity299 and it cost them two managers in one season			1
young star : @entity263 has been a real positive for @entity100 in pre-season @entity295 reason to be cheerful : they have an exciting new manager and none of their key players have been taken away			1
reason to be fearful : they still lack a proper goal - scoring threat and , @entity316 aside , there have not been many signings that would genuinely excite			2
what 's happened over the summer : not a huge amount , besides the arrival of @entity321			0
signing @entity322 to a new contract was a significant coup for the club , but beyond @entity321 ’s ideology they have not added a huge amount			2
what the manager says : ‘ i know the business in football			0
i know that you live by the result , you need to get results			0
if not , you put yourself in difficulties			0
’ one to watch : @entity337			0
he did next to nothing after arriving for £ 30m but there is an excitement at the club that his injuries are resolved and he might be about to come good			1
@entity67 : @entity321 is @entity295 ’s ninth manager since 2001			1
he starts his era at the club knowing that @entity295 demand good results			1
leading the way : @entity321 is looking to help improve @entity295 's fortunes this season @entity348 reason to be cheerful : @entity350 got the one player he really wanted this summer – @entity352			1
reason to be fearful : pre-season results have been less than spectacular and they have a tough start to the season with their opening seven fixtures including games against @entity16 , @entity75 , @entity140 and @entity100			1
they also have the challenge of @entity363 fixtures and travel			0
what 's happened over the summer : they signed @entity350 to a long - term contract , likewise @entity368 , and avoided losing any of their leading lights			2
breaking the bank : @entity348 signed @entity373 star @entity352 from @entity16 for a club - record fee of £ 28m what the manager says : ‘ @entity377 would be to maintain the level we showed last season while coping with the demands of @entity383 football			1
it is about making sure we embrace the @entity363 and use that to develop our potential , but not finding it as an obstacle to our domestic duties			0
’ one to watch : @entity352			1
he was superb last season			2
now he needs to do it again with the pressure of a £ 28m price tag			2
@entity67 : the last time @entity348 splashed big money on a big @entity393 ( @entity394 ) he did very well at the club			1
@entity352 has done enough to be considered a success , but what happens subsequent to the big fee will be as important as what went before .			2

@entity16 should be cheerful with the likes of @entity22 and @entity50
city are looking to retain their title under @entity98
@entity140 approaching a new dawn with @entity196 in charge
@entity409 *captaining* at @entity410 as they aim to improve
@entity75 have splashed the cash , signing @entity204 for £ 30m
@entity100 have lost @entity272 but @entity263 is in fine form
@entity295 hope to *regroup* after an up - and - down season
@entity348 could be contenders for top four after *buying* @entity352
