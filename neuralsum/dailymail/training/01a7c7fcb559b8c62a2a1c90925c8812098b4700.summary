by @entity1 reporter published : 00:06 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 00:06 est , 12 july 2013 from faded flags painted on to the side of buildings , to large ones that nearly engulf their proud bearers , the @entity2 has become a regular sight in the @entity10 photographer @entity11 began to document how the flag has become part of the fabric of @entity10 life by taking pictures of it around her home town of @entity19 and elsewhere in the @entity10 she first noticed the prevalence of flags when she returned to the @entity10 after spending four years in @entity22			1
face of @entity10 : a boy holds the @entity2 flag in @entity26 , @entity27 part of the furniture : a flag pokes out the side of a chair in @entity33 ' the more i looked , the more i saw that people display it every single day in these casual ways , but it almost seemed more real , personal and more in touch with what it means to be @entity10 , ' she told @entity42			1
as she began her @entity44 project , ms @entity11 started to notice @entity2 and strips in unexpected places , such as the side of barns , or taped to cash registers			1
and the flags were on show every day , not just for holidays such as july 4			2
' do n’t they realize they are trying to be patriotic , but they are doing it in kind of a disheveled way ? ' the photographer said she found herself thinking			2
although people are usually absent in her shots , when they do appear they can often become the focus for the photograph			0
street art : the @entity10 flag stands out against graffiti in @entity68 token : a small flag has been taped to a cash register in a @entity72 shop clinging on : a poster with an image of the flag hangs from the side of @entity77 in @entity33 on one occasion ms @entity11 was taking a photo of a flag outside a house when a neighbor across the street came over to ask what she was doing			1
as she explained her project the man told her he always had a flag outside his house , but had taken it down because of the snow			2
he then rushed to his house to fetch the huge flag			0
it ’s the same flag , but he wanted to get his flag , ' ms @entity11 said			1
' i just love that			0
that ’s the connection that every single person displaying the flag seems to have : it is very personal to them			0
' shelter : a large weather - beaten flag is seen tacked to a barn in @entity33 hidden : you can barely see the flag for the trees in this shot taken in @entity110 @entity111 : the remains of a flag hang from a fence in @entity19 , @entity68 faded glory : a few stars are all that remain of this flag spotted on @entity119 in @entity27 the photographer , who was the creative director for the @entity122 adverts that celebrated old films , added that the placing of the flag often reflected its surroundings			1
' there are some joyous , ironic and playful moments and others that are subtle , lonely and separated			0
the flag is not always this beacon , shining and looking so proud and wonderful			0
sometimes , it looks kind of lonely to me , and i wanted to capture that loneliness , ' she said			0
her project , which can be seen on @entity137 is not motivated out of a sense of patriotism , instead coming from her desire to document everyday life and overlooked moments			0
ms @entity11 , who has also directed films , is still adding to the @entity44 project as she travels the @entity10 all @entity10 : a boy absent - mindedly plays with a flag in a @entity19 diner pride : when this homeowner heard about @entity11 's project he proudly showed off his flag reflections : @entity2 adorns the window of this building in @entity19 citizenship : three flags are propped up in a window next to election campaign posters @entity160 : this star spangled banner in @entity110 looks like it has weathered a few storms arrivals : passengers at @entity19 airport seem unaware of the two flags draped above them welcome sight : the @entity2 and @entity170 feature in both windows of this @entity68 state shop fashion : a mannequin wearing leggings blocks the view of this flag hanging outside an @entity110 shop slogan : the stripes on this flag have been replaced with patriotic words standing guard : @entity2 hands either side of a door , with the words ' we closed ' painted on it in @entity68 wash out : a woman waits for her laundry in @entity19 , as a flag hangs high above her in the shadows : a small flag flutters nearly unseen under a @entity68 fire escape melting pot : the @entity10 flag stands out against a foreign goods store in @entity72 have a nice day : two iconic @entity10 images stand side by side eye catching : the bold colors of the flag break up the repetitive look of this @entity68 building strong foundations : this @entity110 house may not be finished but the flag pole is already in place			1
