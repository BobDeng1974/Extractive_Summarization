homeowners have a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash job carried out by gardeners , cleaners and handymen , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the @entity8 said he always asked for a written record even if it was for £ 10 to trim a hedge – because it was the ‘ right thing to do ’			1
his crackdown on cash - in - hand jobs was branded ‘ completely out of touch ’ yesterday as he extended @entity16 ’s war on tax avoidance to ordinary families			1
but pressed about what constitutes tax avoidance , he told the @entity32 : ‘ the right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them			1
’ asked if he followed this rule himself , he replied : ‘ absolutely			2
that ’s because i am the @entity8 and i ’m extremely careful about these things			2
‘ over my life , have i ever given people a tenner and not been given a receipt for it ? probably yes			2
but he said he had not done so ‘ since i have been involved in politics and @entity54 matters ’			2
@entity56 mp @entity55 said it was ‘ ludicrous ’ to expect people to collect receipts and personal information for minor work			2
and he accused @entity16 of wrongly implying that all small businesses were trying to dodge taxes			1
‘ there are so many cash businesses , ’ said the @entity65 mp			0
‘ if you go into a cafe for a cup of tea you would not expect a receipt for it			0
if you were running a fish and chip shop you do not always give receipts			0
it shows a complete lack of understanding of business			0
is he trying to imply that if you are a small business that deals in cash , you are trying to dodge tax ? ‘ i think it shows how completely out of touch he is with small business			1
there is an implication that everybody is out to fiddle their taxes			0
’ mr @entity0 said : ' the right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt ' the row comes as a study reveals that paid work not declared to the taxman is worth an estimated £ 150billion a year , but is lower than most other western countries			1
@entity111 ’s so - called ‘ black economy ’ was equivalent to 10 per cent of national income in 2013 , but half the level of cash - in - hand work in @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
it was also lower than the 13.4 per cent average for all 34 leading nations in the @entity115			0
@entity0 today defended @entity16 's decision to accept a £ 1.65million donation in shares rather than cash as ' tax efficient ' - despite hitting out at people avoiding paying their fair share			1
shopping channel tycoon @entity123 made the donation 2013			0
but by giving the party shares instead of money it reduced the tax mr @entity131 's party had to pay			1
mr @entity0 , speaking to @entity132 on @entity133 5 live , said this was ' small beer compared with what the @entity136 are up to '			1
he also insisted he did n't ' know the details of [ the @entity140 donation ] and it would be wrong for me to do so because as i think it is important that i can be objective on these matters			0
' however , he insisted that @entity145 should have carried out a more comprehensive analysis of @entity147 , the former @entity148 chairman , before he was made a minister			0
@entity150 , the @entity56 chairman , said that ' @entity16 say one thing on tax avoidance , but do another			1
' ' last week @entity131 criticised the practice , but today @entity0 has admitted that the party accepts ' tax efficient ' donations because they ' need the money , '' said mr @entity150			1
free market @entity158 , which carried out the study , found no evidence for a surge in undeclared work during the recession , adding that cash - in - hand work in the @entity111 is at a lower level than in 1997 - 8 when it was equivalent to 13 per cent of national income			0
in 2010 , however , @entity169 claimed that it missed out on £ 42billion in revenue because of tax fraud , avoidance and underpayment – £ 4 billion higher than the previous year			1
a survey last year found that four out of five families had paid a workman cash - in - hand during the previous 12 months			0
almost a third said they had done so three times or more			0
some 14 per cent said they would rather pay less money for a service by paying cash , even if they knew the tradesman was avoiding @entity187 minister @entity186 sparked controversy on the issue in 2012 after claiming it was ‘ morally wrong ’ to pay cash - in - hand			0
mr @entity186 said making small cash payments to cleaners and tradesmen was on a par with tax avoidance , which ministers have already called ‘ morally repugnant ’			2
he added : ‘ getting a discount with your plumber by paying cash in hand is something that is a big cost to the revenue and means others must pay more in tax			2
’ asked explicitly if he disapproves of the practice , he said : ‘ yes , i think it ’s morally wrong			0

@entity0 accused of being ' completely out of touch ' over suggestion
shadow *chancellor* said he always demanded a written record , even for £ 10
it came as @entity16 and the @entity136 continues war of words over tax dodging
