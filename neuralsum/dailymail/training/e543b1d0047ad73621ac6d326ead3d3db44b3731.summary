a race row has erupted in one of @entity3 's wealthiest villages after offensive graffiti was plastered on the site of a proposed @entity7 school			1
if the @entity9 is built it would see more than 1,000 people flock into @entity11 , @entity12 , from as far afield as @entity13			1
tension in the village has grown over the past fortnight with angry locals venting their anger online and at parish council meetings			0
now one racist hooligan has daubed ' no p * * * school ' and ' @entity23 ' on a sign at the proposed site			1
race row : someone has daubed this sign on the site of a proposed school with racist language in a village that opposes it up for sale : @entity33 ( pictured ) is the site in @entity11 where developers are hoping to build a 850 place @entity7 faith school residents in @entity11 have condemned the thugs responsible for the graffiti , claiming their objections to the school have nothing to do with race			1
but they feel the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which is behind the proposed faith school , could be fuelling rumours it is a race issue by circulating images of the graffiti			1
@entity51 , vice chairman of the @entity52 , said : ' it was discovered at 8:30am in the morning and seven villagers scrubbed it off within the hour			0
' as a village we were offended by it			0
we do n't want to offend our @entity60 neighbours or the @entity45 as we are a peaceful village			2
' @entity62 is a peaceful religion but this is immature and inflammatory behaviour and it would n't surprise me if the @entity45 is turning this into a race issue			1
' upset : campaigners @entity68 and @entity51 from @entity11 , who are fighting the plans @entity11 is known for the exclusive @entity72 estate which featured in the @entity74 classic goldfinger			2
recent figures ranked @entity11 as having the eighth highest concentration of Â£ 1 million properties sold in @entity3			2
it is understood mr @entity79 has also sent the image to @entity81 , the @entity81 mp who represents @entity11 as part of the @entity83			0
in touch : local mp @entity81 is said to have been sent the image of the graffiti locals have said their opposition to the school is based on the proposed site - the current @entity3 headquarters for @entity33 - being on greenbelt land			1
they say @entity11 does n't have the infrastructure to deal with 1,000 people entering the village each day and also fear children will lose their right to free bus travel if the multi-million pound taxpayer - funded school opens on the site			1
when 222 parents at the village 's primary school were asked if they would send their child to the @entity106 , 93.25 per cent said no. the chairman of the @entity45 yesterday has described the racist graffiti as ' unfortunate '			0
@entity79 said : ' the incident of graffiti at the proposed school site is unfortunate			2
' we would much rather things like this were n't happening and , as a @entity45 , we would prefer to focus on the more important questions of how we can best deliver a new school in this location and serving this community			0
' we do not want to draw unnecessary attention to this incident			0
' we want to address the more fundamental questions about improving local educational choice and bringing forward an excellent planning proposition			0

@entity9 is planned for exclusive village of @entity11
