by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 must follow the blueprint of @entity5 if they are to end their 10 - year @entity7 trophy drought against their big spending title rivals			1
@entity5 were crowned @entity10 champions for the first time since 1996 last season after breaking the dominance of @entity14 and city rivals @entity16			1
@entity18 's side wrestled the title away from the @entity21 duo despite the loss of talisman @entity23 to @entity24 , while @entity16 and @entity14 spent heavily on marquee signings @entity26 and @entity27 respectively			1
' @entity5 and @entity3 have to play the same way , but everyone is looking to win titles			2
' they had an incredible season last year , winning titles takes several campaigns , i admire everything they have conquered			0
many people do not realise how hard it is to win a league competing with @entity14 or @entity5			2
' despite the signings of @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 this summer , the @entity61 international believes next season 's @entity7 is too close to call with all their title rivals strengthening as well this summer			1
' @entity44 are the current champions and will always be the ones to watch out for , ' he added			0
' @entity70 are coming off the back of a bad season - but they will come back stronger this season			0
having no @entity75 competition this season will focus their attention on the league			0

' i do not want to forget other teams like @entity92 , who went so close to the title last year , or @entity95			0
i 'm sure it will be very open and just hope that @entity3 are in the top group			0
' new recruit : @entity80 striker @entity83 cost Â£ 32million from @entity5 in july exciting times : @entity3 have strengthened their squad with four new signings including @entity63			1
