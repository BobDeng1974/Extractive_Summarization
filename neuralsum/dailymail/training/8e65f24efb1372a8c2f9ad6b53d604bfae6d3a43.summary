by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 16 may 2013 an £ 8million cinema and leisure complex residents of a market town campaigned to get built is to be completely dismantled six months into the project because it is less than a metre out of place			1
the new @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , will be torn down and rebuilt after an embarrassing design error left it too close to existing houses			1
work on the six - screen cinema , known as the @entity14 , began at the end of november - six years after residents voted for the leisure facility			1
coming down : six months after work started the £ 8million cinema complex being built in @entity9 , @entity10 , it is being torn down because it is in the wrong place starting again : this artist 's impression shows what the new site will look like , and local people have campaigned for years to get it built it was due to open in september but this decision , which has been agreed with the @entity30 , will delay completion by four months until next january			1
construction work had already been delayed whilst the contractor @entity33 and developers waited for today 's decision			0
@entity37 had submitted a revised planning application after it came to light that parts of the buildings were being positioned marginally closer to the site 's north wall than was planned			2
but the application will now be withdrawn and the project rebuilt to accord with the consented scheme			0
' we have taken the unprecedented step of halting the existing work and having parts rebuilt to assuage any concerns that adjoining landowners may have , ' @entity46 , of @entity47 , said			0
' although we are only talking about a few centimetres we believe that this is the best solution for all concerned and avoid further delay of these much wanted facilities			0
' all involved have acted in a thoroughly open and professional way , for which i am very grateful			0
' blunder : the project has been built out of place and is too close to these houses , so is therefore being constructed without planning consent @entity65 , of @entity8 , said : ' this is unfortunate news but the good news is that we are still on track to opening our cinema in @entity9 , albeit now early in the new year			1
' @entity71 , of @entity72 , added : ' this situation results from an error in design information provided to us by our lead design consultant			0
' this inaccuracy , which was present from the earliest stages of the scheme , sadly was n't picked up by any members of the client , design or construction teams			0
' as soon as the miscalculation was identified we have dealt quickly and efficiently to ensure that our client 's instructions are fully complied with , along with our contractual obligations to discharge in accordance with the planning consent			1
' delay : pulling down the structure , which was started last year , will now not be completed until 2014 residents and town councillors in @entity9 have been campaigning for around 10 years			1
in 2006 @entity95 , a @entity96 - based millionaire with links to the town , donated about £ 1 million for a leisure facility in @entity9			2
residents were consulted and in 2007 said they favoured a cinema			0
the development , which is being built on the site of a former recycling centre , will consist of a six - screen cinema , four restaurants , three flats , a public plaza and parking for cars and bikes .			2

builders started on site six months **ago** but were putting it too near houses
blunder means giant structure no longer meets *approved* planning consent
@entity9 residents started campaign for complex to be built six years **ago**
