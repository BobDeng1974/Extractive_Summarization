by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 4 june 2013 data from more than 3,500 sti consultations across @entity3 shows that @entity4 seek the most advice for symptoms of @entity7 , closely followed by @entity8 and @entity9 @entity4 has been named the sexually transmitted infection capital of @entity3			1
data from more than 3,500 @entity7 consultations across @entity3 shows that @entity4 seek the most advice for symptoms of @entity7			1
@entity8 were found to be the second most likely to require treatment for an sti and they are followed closely by @entity9 , who are the third most likely to catch an infection			1
the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 were also in the top ten most likely to suffer from an @entity7 , according to data collected by an online health clinic			0
across @entity3 , chlamydia was revealed to be the most common sti			1
the data , from online clinic @entity24 , also shows that there has been a significant rise in the number of reported cases of @entity7 across @entity3 in the last decade - @entity4 experienced a 38 per cent rise in chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases in recent years			1
however , experts believe that there may be other reasons why @entity4 are the most likely to seek treatment for @entity7 – in @entity4 it is a legal requirement that people tell any past sexual partners of their diagnosis if they seek treatment			1
dr @entity42 , medical adviser at @entity24 said : ‘ with the stringent rules in their country , it may be we are seeing a knock on effect of @entity4 people seeking treatment for @entity7 after they have been told by a partner they are infected			1
‘ although some may view the country ’s rules as “ draconian ” , having legislation which protects people from infection could help other countries within the @entity56 dent the rising @entity7 figures			2
@entity60 ‘ there are a number of @entity7 that can be caught from either unprotected sex or close contact			2
some are treatable , such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea			0
‘ however , those caused by viral infections such as genital herpes and genital warts may be difficult to treat or be incurable , and you could suffer symptoms throughout your life			0
‘ curable , or incurable , all @entity7 pose a risk to your health and can cause permanent damage or infertility if left untreated , so it is imperative you seek advice if you have been put at risk of infection			2
’ the research comes after @entity24 revealed that @entity85 is the @entity7 capital of the @entity9			2
following @entity85 were the residents of @entity87 , with @entity88 coming in a close third			0
in all locations , chlamydia was the most commonly treated @entity7 in the @entity9 , with gonorrhoea and genital warts being the second and third			2
there has been a significant rise in the number of reported cases of @entity7 in the @entity9 since the 1990s , with the number of reported cases of chlamydia tripling between 1995 and 2005			1
the most affected age group used to be 16 to 24 - year - olds , but the online clinic found that the average age has risen to 34.9			0
@entity105 also revealed chlamydia ( pictured ) is the most common @entity7 in @entity3 and the number of cases is rising rapidly			1
the most affected age group used to be 16 to 24 - year - olds , but the average age has risen to 34.9 cases of ' untreatable gonorrhoea ' have also soared by 25 per cent in a year and experts are warning the disease is becoming more resistant to treatment			0
more than 20,000 new cases of the @entity7 were diagnosed in 2011			0
the spike has led to the launch of a new campaign to tackle the growing threat in @entity119 and @entity120 in a bid to reverse the trend			0
health experts are hoping the first @entity124 will increase awareness of the disease , which is the second most common bacterial sti in @entity119			0
the plan , established by the @entity129 , will monitor the global problem of increasing resistance over the last 10 years .			0

in @entity3 , @entity4 are the most likely to seek treatment for an @entity7
*germans* are second most likely to contract an infection , @entity9 are third
