but after losing the red lipstick for a more natural look , it appears the 54 - year - old tv chef may have sparked a trend - with sales of nude lipsticks rising by 62 per cent			1
according to high street chain @entity18 , nude and sheer lipsticks have been outselling bright reds and hot pinks for the first time in three years			1
change : the tv chef was famed for her love of pillar box red lipstick but has since swapped it for a nude shade the natural trend - which has been mirrored across fashion catwalks - also appears to have been favoured by @entity32 's leading ladies			1
arriving on the red carpet of last weekend 's @entity34 and @entity35 who ditched their usual crimson lips for a nude look			2
however retail experts yesterday claimed it is not celebrity trend setters fuelling the rise in sales but instead a theory dubbed the ' lipstick index '			1
economists believe sales of bright red lippy will rise during economic recession and therefore fall during an upturn			1
surprise : her scaled - down make up on the latest cover of @entity54 was a surprising change from her usual look @entity57 : within days of her shoot for the taste being released , this @entity59 dress was sold out @entity65 © e @entity64 chairman , @entity63 , coined theory in 2001 although the effect was first noted in the @entity68			1

the glamorous chef , who used to write for @entity54 , has a history of sparking style trends in both fashion and cooking			2
her penchant for @entity86 's figure - hugging dresses led to high street stores stocking similar garments , and a spike in the designer 's sales			2
in january , it emerged the blue @entity59 dress by @entity94 that @entity7 wore in @entity95 sold out within days of the advert hitting screens			0
and retailers such as @entity99 have dubbed her the reason for an upturn in home - baking during the summer months - it is normally a winter activity			0
' the @entity105 saw a large number of stars wearing neutral make up , and the same can be said for our popular and favourite tv personalities			0
' even reality star @entity110 has recently undergone a make - under , transitioning from bright red lipstick and heavy application , towards a softer more relaxed appearance i like to call naked make - up			1
' this look creates an illusion of being make - up free but with full coverage , perfect for summer			0
' today an estimated 81 per cent of women worldwide wear lipstick , with best nude sellers including @entity122 , @entity124 's @entity123 and @entity126 's @entity125			2
but despite the move to a more natural look , red lipstick look is still a firm favourite among a host of stars such as actresses @entity133 and @entity135			1
the iconic scarlet look was also always worn by @entity137 and @entity138			0
