by @entity0 floating through space ... nomadic planets may pick up and harbour life as they journey around the galaxy researchers have come up with a startling suggestion for how life could propagate across our galaxy			2
identifying the mathematical hole between the expected mass of our galaxy - @entity12 - and what is observed , they theorise that there are billions and billions of ' nomadic ' planets , unaffiliated to any particular star , floating through the darkness of space			1
the scientists from the @entity21 at the @entity22 have proposed that these planets originated in the early @entity24 , within a few million years of the @entity25 , and that they make up most of the so - called ' missing mass '			2
the scientists calculate that these planetary body would cross the inner solar system every 25 million years on average - and during each transit , dust from the neighbourhood , including living cells , would become implanted at its surface			1
these free - floating planets would then end up mixing harbouring the living cells with the planet 's own make - up , and life could spread by this method on a galaxy - wide scale			1
since 1995 , when the first extrasolar planet was reported , interest in searching for planets has reached a feverish pitch			0
the 750 or so detections of exo - planets are all of planets orbiting stars , and very few , if any , have been deemed potential candidates for life			0
the possibility of a much larger number of planets was first suggested in earlier studies where the effects of gravitational lensing of distant quasars by intervening planet - sized bodies were measured			0
recently several groups of investigators have suggested that a few billion such objects could exist in the galaxy			0
the planets of our solar system are anchored in orbit around the sun , in contrast to nomadic planets which simply drift through the ether the team , led by professor @entity74 , have increased this grand total of planets to a few hundred thousand billion ( a few thousand for every @entity12 star ) - each one harbouring the legacy of cosmic primordial life			1
their findings are published online in the @entity82 journal @entity83 .			0

hundreds of thousand billion planets could be floating nomadically through the galaxy
theory would *explain* the un*explain*ed ' missing matter ' of the @entity12
planets would cross the galaxy , picking up living cells as they floated through cosmic dust
