by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 10:39 est , 7 march 2014 as the centenary of the @entity4 approaches , @entity2 prepares to mark the outbreak of one of the largest conflicts in history with sombre remembrance ceremonies			0
however , musician @entity10 and actor @entity11 have raised eyebrows over their decision to write and record a 21 - century war poem inspired by the likes of @entity16 and @entity17			1
called the occupation the verse talks about the @entity20 and @entity22 wars and will be released as part of the band 's new album , but has drawn thinly veiled criticism for making commercial gain on the back of the centenary			1
@entity31 's lead singer @entity10 ( left ) has written a 21 - century war poem for the band 's new album to commemorate the @entity4 centenary this year , which will be read by @entity11 ( right ) a spokesman for @entity36 , which is leading the centenary memorial efforts , said : ' @entity2 is marking the centenary of the @entity4 because of its huge impact on world history and as a tribute to the sacrifices made by @entity2 and @entity43 servicemen and civilians			1
' the government ’s programme to mark this takes remembrance as its theme , with an emphasis on youth and education			0
' but we appreciate that others will mark the anniversary in different ways , some of which will be challenging and controversial , and some for commercial gain			1
@entity10 is also now a judge on @entity60 taking over from @entity61 who abandoned the programme along with @entity63 last year ' in the end it ’s for the public to judge how appropriate each offering is to the memory of those that made the ultimate sacrifice 100 years ago			1
' the spokesman added that the @entity36 will not be involving itself with the recording			0
poet and @entity16 scholar @entity75 added : ' obviously it is not a great poem , but it is very amusing			1
' i 'm not being rude by saying that it does n't compare to @entity16 because he was one of the best writers this country has produced and he worked at it for years			2
' it is up - to - date in a way @entity16 is n't , although his poetry is timeless			2
' the two - minute poem is read by @entity11 over a soundtrack of battlefield noises , calls to prayer and hubbub from within the houses of @entity93			1
speaking to @entity94 , @entity10 said : ' when i was writing the lyrics for the record , the whole @entity4 centenary thing was flying around			2
so if you ’re writing honestly , it ’s going to leak in there			0
' i wrote the poem as an exercise originally			0
the original story was an imaginary assault by a superpower – not necessarily the @entity106 , trying to take over @entity107			0
' they are invading @entity107 , wiping out @entity107			0
then going " now what do we do , where do we go next ? " ' @entity11 said he decided to read the poem , which contains references to ' infidels ' on their knees and oil pipelines that will ' bleed the place dry ' , after becoming ' interested by the concept '			1
the @entity31 's fifth album , called @entity119 in reference to the @entity122 election slogan , is due for release at the end of march			2
while the band enjoyed both popular and critical success in the mid- 2000s with their debut album @entity130 , and the follow - up @entity131 , their influence has since waned			0
the band took a hiatus after their third album between 2009 and 2011 , before releasing their fourth album with the online gimmick of being able to pick between 20 tracks so listeners could create their own record			0
they lost drummer @entity141 in 2012 after issuing a compilation album of singles , and front - man @entity10 is now a judge on @entity144 show @entity60 , replacing @entity61 who walked out along with @entity63 last year			1
at the time of publishing , @entity10 could not be reached for comment			0
true master : @entity4 soldier and poet @entity16 who wrote @entity151 the occupation the occupation of @entity154 decreed by commander in chief won by the infantry , led by the colonel came at costs that would beggar belief as they marched upon the inferno and the inﬁdels dropped to their knees millions of civilians crammed in pavilions came to watch it on big screen tvs the population of @entity154 went from millions to thousands to one the survivor then wrote in his journal " why on @entity172 did it take them so long ? " within weeks we constructed a pipeline within years we 'll have run the place dry it 'll just about last us our lifetime so it 's hip hip hoorays and high ﬁves on the factory ﬂoor there 's a whisper we built cannons before it began but the engines still pumping its piston and the turbine still whirring its fan the assembly line spits out the surplus into purpose built lead lined white vans @entity197 stockpile as ministry workers fill their pockets with all that they can secret meetings are held in the senate what to do with this excess supply there 's a plan to abandon the planet one @entity208 at a time so we get up each day and have breakfast read the news and the weather forecast as we sit and we open our letters and we pray that it wo n't be our last .			2
