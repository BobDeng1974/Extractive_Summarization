@entity1 's staff asked @entity2 to send her clothes – after she had threatened to sue the store for using her face on a t - shirt			1
the singer claims the ‘ unendorsed ’ white t - shirt with a photograph of her in a bra top may have damaged her image			1
but that did n’t stop her entourage calling @entity2 six times after a dispute had broken out ‘ asking for products for her to wear ’ , according to the store			2
dispute : @entity1 is suing @entity2 over the t - shirt bearing the picture of her face , seen left , which she claims is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was ' genuine ' merchandise but while the singer is claiming the top blighted her image it has not stopped her entourage contacting @entity2 to ask for clothes for @entity1 half a dozen times since the lawsuit was launched. , the retailer 's lawyers said			1
a barrister at @entity38 's @entity37 today claimed @entity1 's representatives had asked @entity2 for products for the singer on ' 10 recent occasions ' , and said her ' shopping habits ' were testament to the retailer 's own considerable reputation			1
of those 10 occasions , six came after @entity1 launched proceedings against @entity2 , said @entity48			2
mr @entity49 said : ' it is not in dispute that @entity1 is a celebrity ( but ) the reputation of @entity2 is also material to the allegation of misrepresentation			1
' @entity1 's own shopping habits provide compelling evidence of @entity2 's reputation in fashion wear			1
( there are ) 10 recent occasions on which her representatives have contacted @entity2 asking for products for her to wear			2
' we note that six of these requests post-date this dispute , ' the barrister said			0
' shopping habits ' : employees of @entity1 , seen wearing a @entity2 jumper last year , have asked for clothes for the singer since she launched legal proceedings , the retailer 's lawyers said the t - shirt in question is printed with a snap of the star wearing a bra top , which she says was ' very similar ' to images used on one of her album covers			1
she claims sales of the shirt amounted to ' passing off ' and may have led to her reputation being tarnished with her fans , had they bought the garment thinking it was ' genuine ' endorsed merchandise with ' an emotional connection to their heroine '			2
lawyers for @entity2 maintain the retailer did nothing wrong , and accuse the pop star of making an unjustifiable bid to establish a ' free standing image right ' over use of her picture in the @entity101			1
mr @entity102 , sitting at @entity38 's @entity37 , heard that @entity2 bought a licence to use the image on the t - shirt from the photographer who took it , during the video shoot for @entity1 's single @entity109 which was filmed in @entity110 and @entity111 , @entity112 , in november 2011			1
however the 25 - year - old singer protested that they had short changed her and her fans when the t - shirt went on sale			1
the judge was shown the controversial tank - top t - shirt , showing the singer in a pale bra top with her hair in an up - do , as part of a ' wall of t - shirts ' displayed to the court on coat hangers in evidence today			1
@entity128 , for @entity1 , who is suing @entity2 's owners , @entity130 under her real name , @entity1 , told the court : ' @entity1 is one of the world 's most famous musical performing artists			1
' like most well known contemporary performing artists , she engages in merchandising , and like most such performing artists , it represents a significant part of her revenue stream			0
' in 2012 , @entity2 sold a t - shirt displaying a clearly recognisable image of @entity1 taken when she was on a video shoot			1
she was wearing her makeup and hairdo for the video shoot , and very similar images of her appeared on her cd inlay ( for the album @entity151			0
) ' the sales ... gave rise to a likelihood of deception , damaging @entity1 's goodwill			0
' a substantial number of people buying , or even seeing , those t - shirts would think they are approved or somehow connected with @entity1 , when , in fact , they were not approved of or connected with her at all			2
' this will be particularly so amongst the group of most likely purchasers of those t - shirts , namely fans of @entity1			2
' we are saying that one of the qualities of the t - shirt is the mere fact of whether it has been endorsed or not , and is a genuine object , emanating from the source of the fans ' affection			1
' it is not so much a concern about the quality of the item , but it not having the emotional attachment to the heroine and ( for fans ) the desire to own the actual item issued by their heroine			0
claims : @entity2 was selling a t - shirt emblazoned with a picture of @entity1 's face she claims is ' very similar ' to one of her album covers ' @entity1 's case is not about stopping the sale of all images of her on t - shirts in the @entity101 , nor is it about trying to create a free standing so - called image right in the @entity101			1
passing off is a question of fact in each case			0
' @entity2 accepts that @entity1 has generated goodwill as a musical performing artist			2
it denies that she has any goodwill in any other area			0
' @entity1 's case is that she has generated reputation and goodwill beyond that as a musical performing artist ( which ) extends into the fashion and clothing industries and has done so for years			2
' she has collaborated in the design of clothes with a range of clothing designers at the high end of fashion , including @entity223 and @entity224 , and at established high street fashion stores , including @entity226			0
' these garments were not only endorsed by her but were sold and labelled under @entity1 's name and trademark			0
these ranges were highly acclaimed , ' the barrister said			0
mr @entity232 concluded by saying that @entity1 is seeking a ' blanket injunction ' preventing @entity2 from offering for sale any clothing bearing her image			0
@entity48 , for @entity2 , responded that , having bought a licence to use the image from the photographer who took it , the fashion giants were fully entitled to sell the t - shirt			1
' we resist the claim on two main bases ; first , this is , in substance and reality , an impermissible attempt by @entity1 to establish an image reproduction right in the @entity101			0
there is no such right			0
' on the contrary , @entity2 are entitled honestly to sell the garment , having obtained the necessary copyright licence			0
' secondly there is no representation here , given that the garment is fashion wear and not promotional merchandise			0
' the hearing , set to last until next week , continues .			0
