by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 17 july 2013 @entity1 have confirmed they made a written offer for @entity3 but @entity4 rejected their sensational opening bid			1
@entity6 understands the initial offer on tuesday was £ 10million cash plus @entity9 or @entity10 but @entity1 deny involving the two players in their bid			1
the @entity14 club then returned with a second offer of £ 22m outright - but that was also rejected by @entity4 , who told their @entity19 rivals not come back with another offer			1
something on your mind ? @entity3 arrives at @entity4 's training ground on wednesday @entity25 's first home game in charge of @entity4 is against ... you guessed it , @entity1 on august 26			1
will @entity3 line up against his former side or will he be made to sweat until the transfer window closes on september 2 ? @entity4 have insisted @entity3 is not for sale and @entity1 boss @entity32 must now decide whether to submit a fresh offer			1
a statement from @entity1 read : ‘ @entity1 can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to @entity4 for the transfer of @entity3			1
' but in another twist , @entity1 appeared to suggest that @entity6 's story came from @entity4 's training camp in @entity40			1
the statement continued : ' although the terms of the offer are confidential , for the avoidance of doubt and to the contrary to what appears to be being briefed to the press in @entity40 , the purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from @entity1 to @entity4			1
’ @entity4 insist they have not briefed the press on this story but simply confirmed the bid had been made			2
@entity1 have been warned , however , not to return with a second bid as @entity4 have no intention of selling @entity3 to another @entity19 club			1
up for grabs ? @entity1 have offered @entity10 ( above ) or @entity9 ( below ) in part - exchange for @entity3 @entity60 have already made an initial enquiry and remain in the frame despite also making offers for @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity32 is willing to sell @entity10 and @entity9 and hoped the inclusion of one of them in a deal would tempt @entity4 to sell up			1
meanwhile , @entity4 's chief executive @entity70 has left the club 's tour of @entity73 to try to secure @entity74 from @entity75			2
@entity3 feels he is at the peak of his career and has nothing to prove after nine seasons at @entity80			0
the @entity82 forward is understood to be ‘ angry and confused ’ over comments by new manager @entity25 that he will not be sold because he provides important back - up for first - choice striker @entity84			0
the offending words were delivered to sunday newspaper journalists during a briefing with @entity25 in @entity89 last week			0
@entity25 said : ‘ overall , my thought on @entity3 is that if for any reason we had an injury to @entity84 we are going to need him and i want as many options as possible			0
’ uncertain future : @entity3 was overshadowed by @entity84 ( below ) at @entity4 last season since returning from @entity4 ’s tour of the @entity99 and @entity73 for treatment on a hamstring injury last week , the 27 - year - old has made his feelings known to the club			1
he has re-iterated his desire to leave — having issued a similar message to sir @entity106 last season — and is now prepared to put in a formal transfer request			0
@entity3 wants to go this summer with the @entity108 less than a year away , and sources close to the player say he has no intention of allowing his career to go backwards by being a squad member or playing second fiddle to @entity115			2
@entity25 faces a quandary now the player has raised the stakes but there seems little chance of him staying			0
@entity4 have already discussed the possible scenarios and believe that out of @entity124 , @entity75 and @entity125 , the @entity123 champions would be their preferred buyer			0
plenty to ponder : @entity25 speaks to assistant @entity127 , @entity128 and coach @entity129 then and now : @entity25 helped @entity3 develop at @entity130 ( left ) but the player is now far from happy ( right ) @entity32 added more fuel to his interest in @entity3 on tuesday by warning that @entity82 ’s @entity108 hopes could suffer if he stays at @entity4			1
@entity1 appear to have settled on @entity3 as their main target after losing out on @entity136 to @entity137 and @entity138 to @entity125			2
@entity32 said : ‘ if @entity3 is a second choice for @entity4 , then the national team will be affected			2
’ he also said that @entity3 is ' a player i like very , very much			2
' he added : ' being fast and direct , i like him very much but he ’s a @entity4 player			2
from an ethical point of view i ca n’t speak about players from other teams			0
' big fan : @entity32 has not tried to hide his admiration for @entity3 as he tries to bring him to @entity1 those comments forced @entity25 to reaffirm his stance that he would not sell a player he brought through at @entity130			1
' unless i was speaking double @entity153 last week , we said @entity3 is not for sale , ' he insisted			0
' it ’s hard to keep repeating myself but i will — @entity3 is a @entity4 player and it will remain that way			1
' @entity32 said in his comments that he does n’t normally talk about other players			0
' @entity3 must now consider whether he takes the next step and puts in a transfer request			0
he arrived at @entity164 on wednesday morning as he recovers from his slight hamstring injury along with @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
