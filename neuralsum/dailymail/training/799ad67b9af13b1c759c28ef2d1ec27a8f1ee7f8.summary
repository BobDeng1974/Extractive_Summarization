@entity0 remains in the market for attacking personnel but he may have unearthed a gem from the club 's academy after teenager @entity6 tortured @entity7 in a 3 - 1 victory at the @entity9			1
the 18 - year - old @entity10 – who also qualifies for @entity12 – laid on one goal for @entity14 and scored another as the @entity16 enjoyed an unlikely win over their @entity19 hosts			2
@entity6 – who was born in @entity20 - is a product of the youth system on @entity23 having signed from @entity24 in 2012			2
he 's yet to make his competitive debut but is sure to now figure in @entity0 's first - team plans after an impressive pre-season			0
by then , however , the damage had been done			0
the opening goal arrived after just 10 minutes			0
skipping clear of @entity45 down the left , @entity6 served an enticing centre for @entity14 who – with work still to be done – climbed above his marker before flashing an angled header into the bottom corner from 10 yards			2
it was a classy finish and sure to please @entity0 having seen his side barely muster an effort on goal - save for @entity73 's consolation - during the 3 - 1 defeat to @entity107 24 hours earlier			1
@entity45 – who was turned inside and out by @entity6 for the opener – tried to make amends when he slammed a 25 - yard free - kick narrowly over @entity63 's crossbar			0
improvement : @entity0 will have been impressed with the performance after defeat to @entity107 on saturday new man : @entity80 made his debut for @entity29 having only signed on sunday morning but @entity29 doubled their advantage eight minutes after half - time , @entity6 wriggling free of two blue shirts down the left being seeing his cross sail over the head of goalkeeper @entity44 and into the far corner			1
it was fortuitous but well deserved and the skill in escaping his minders was worthy of the goal			0
@entity128 international @entity82 was on as a second - half substitute and he added a little gloss to the scoreline with a classy finish on 72 minutes , set up by debutant @entity80 who joined earlier in the day on a season - long loan from @entity134			1
@entity79 pressured @entity46 into a mistake and @entity82 seized the loose ball before galloping clear on goal and slotting beyond @entity44			0
@entity7 did nick a consolation when @entity59 poked home from close range in stoppage - time but the night had belonged to man - of - the - match @entity35 – @entity0 will be hoping it 's the first of many			1
respect : the players took part in a minute 's applause to remember fans @entity147 and @entity149 battling hard : @entity29 were the better side in the first half before pulling away after the break in command : @entity69 sees off a @entity7 attack as his side put in a solid display			1

@entity14 scores second goal of pre-season to put @entity29 ahead
young winger @entity6 adds second goal with a cross that loops in
@entity82 makes it 3 - 0 with a cool finish
new signing @entity80 makes debut from the bench
@entity7 score late consolation goal through @entity59
@entity29 *bounce* back from 3 - 1 defeat to @entity107
