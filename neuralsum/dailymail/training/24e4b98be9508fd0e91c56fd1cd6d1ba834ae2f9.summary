an accident and emergency unit criticised in an official report for being unsafe and unable to cope with demand is set to be swamped with thousands of extra patients – thanks to emergency department closures elsewhere			1
the chief inspector of @entity8 painted a picture of chaos at ‘ very busy ’ @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , after a recent visit			1
but its @entity15 will soon have to deal with at least 8,000 more patients a year due to the controversial closure of two @entity13 units last week			1
@entity20 , which treated 22,000 patients , shut on wednesday despite protests to keep it open in his report on @entity11 , professor sir @entity26 , who leads the @entity29 ’s inspectors , found that : - its @entity15 had ‘ inadequate staffing levels to protect patients from avoidable harm ’ - @entity35 were ‘ often “ bedded down ” in @entity15 ’ – because there were no free ward beds - @entity38 had to wait too long to off - load desperately sick patients – resulting in eight ‘ serious incidents ’ in just 14 months - the department ‘ struggled ’ at periods of high demand and was ‘ consistently not meeting the four - hour @entity15 waiting - time target ’ - staff morale was ‘ low ’ and senior management was ‘ unaware of the issues within critical care ’ sir @entity26 concluded the hospital ‘ requires improvement ’ and left managers an urgent ‘ to do ’ list			1
ironically , one of the two a&es that has just closed – at @entity56 – was ranked ‘ good ’ in the same @entity29 review			0
‘ the @entity15 department provided care and treatment that was safe , ’ wrote sir @entity26 and his team of inspectors after their visit to the hospital in @entity62 in may			1
‘ @entity66 expressed pride to be working in the @entity15 department			0
’ the @entity68 has been campaigning for two years to save @entity69 from closure			0
but @entity15 , which treated 14,000 patients a year , shut on wednesday			1
so too did the unit at @entity20 , which treated 22,000			1
both have been replaced with 24/7 ‘ @entity74 ’ ( @entity75 ) – which have been criticised for offering a variable service , with some staffed by nurses alone at night			1
@entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , will soon have to deal with at least 8,000 more patients a year due to the controversial closure of two @entity13 units last week @entity82 bosses hope the @entity75 will be able to deal with @entity15 patients without life - threatening illness or injuries			1
they insist the ‘ changes ’ will improve care by centralising staff and resources			0
they estimate the closure of @entity92 ’s @entity15 will lead to another 8,300 patients going to @entity11 – a ten per cent rise			1
but predictions following previous closures have been well wide of the mark			0
the closure of @entity99 in @entity100 was expected to lead to 26,000 more patients at @entity102 in @entity103 ; that was recently revised up to 40,000			0
even if the forecast is right , doctors fear the extra patients could cause problems across the whole of @entity11			2
one said : ‘ there was no slack in the system as it was			0
’ hospital chiefs seemed nonchalant about the @entity29 report at a july board meeting			0
‘ only one issue within the report , in relation to critical care , had not been expected , ’ stated the minutes			0
‘ otherwise there were no surprises			0
’ @entity15 , which treated 14,000 patients a year , closed on wednesday ( file picture ) @entity125 , mp for @entity126 , said : ‘ six months before these closures the trust said that it needed another 123 beds to meet local demand			1
i ’m concerned @entity15 waiting times will continue to rise – as will waiting times for routine operations , as the hospital will be full up			2
’ most @entity137 patients not dealt with by its @entity74 are expected go to @entity139 in @entity140 – which was itself working at ‘ maximum utilisation ’ over the summer			2
@entity11 and @entity139 ’s are being revamped to cope , said a spokesman for the @entity82 trusts that run them			0
a new £ 21 million , 40 - bay @entity15 unit is opening at @entity11 , and it will get 20 more ward beds			2
@entity139 ’s is getting extra staff and beds in @entity15 , a new 15 - bed elderly care ward and an ambulatory care unit			0
@entity151 , chief executive of @entity152 , said : ‘ we do not expect a large impact on @entity11 as a result of the closure of @entity92 and @entity137 units			2

@entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , will soon have to deal with at least 8,000 more patients a year due to the closure of two @entity13 units
