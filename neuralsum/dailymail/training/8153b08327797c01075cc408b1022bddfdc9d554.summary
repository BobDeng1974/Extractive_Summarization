the @entity0 showed he has a sense of humour as well as a caring side today when he donned a red nose at the wedding of members of a charity that uses clowns to cheer up children			2
pope @entity10 appeared at the @entity11 to congratulate the newlyweds from the @entity13 who were getting married there			1
as the pair came down the steps , he took the opportunity to show his support for the charity by donning the universal symbol of comedy			1
who nose what he'lll do next ? pope @entity10 dons a red nose to surprise two newlyweds who are volunteers with the @entity26 , a charity that offers clown therapy to sick children @entity10 is fast becoming well known for his informal manner , which has landed him in situations that would have been unthinkable to his predecessors			1
he has posed opened an account on the popular photo - sharing site @entity34 , posed for selfies with worshippers after mass and , just seven days ago , barely batted an eyelid when a youngster leapt on stage at the @entity11			1
apparently unperturbed by the huge audience , the boy happily stood next to @entity10 on the stage in @entity44 and then hugged his leg			1
cool as a cucumber , the @entity46 responded by patting him on the head and carrying on with his speech			0
unthinkable to his predecessors : the moment last week that a young boy ran onto the stage in @entity44 and hugged pope @entity10 's leg as he made a speech @entity53 - born @entity10 began his papacy in march this year after the shock resignation of pope @entity56 who resigned a month earlier			1
he has apparently set about making the @entity58 more relevant to the modern era , asking questions of centuries - old doctrines like the celibacy of priests , opposition to homosexuality and contraception , and the secondary position of women in the church			0
in a series of breaks with protocol , he has telephoned worshippers who have left him letters , established @entity11 sports teams , donated money to hard up pensioners and offered personally to baptise the child of a woman who had refused her partner 's demands she have an abortion			2
last month he again showcased his lively sense of humour when he stopped the @entity85 to try on a firefighter 's helmet in front of a @entity11 crowd			2
trying it on for size : pope @entity10 wears a firefighter 's helmet as he arrives to lead his general audience in @entity44 at the @entity11 last month so today 's episode was merely what @entity58 have come to expect from their dynamic new pope			1
@entity13 @entity98 , the charity the newly - married couple are associated with , runs clown therapy sessions for children with cancer in hospitals , nursing homes and orphanages			0
it also offers economic and practical support for their families			0
its website says : ' the association was founded with the aim to provide support , both moral , psychological and economic ( where possible ) to the families whose children are suffering from the cancer			0
' the weekly trips , specialist visits , medical advice and hotels stays for the parents of patients involve troubles and expenses			0
' the happy life of a child who just want to play , go to school or do what any child of that age would do , together with the life of the family , are rudely interrupted and often destroyed through an ordeal endless and excruciating			0
' and it is at this precise moment that our association tries to help out			0
