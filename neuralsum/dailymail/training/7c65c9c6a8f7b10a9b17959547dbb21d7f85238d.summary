pregnant women can drink alcohol and coffee and dye their hair – but should avoid gardening , according to an expert who aims to dispel ‘ motherhood myths ’			1
economist and author @entity7 contradicts conventional wisdom and advocates a much more relaxed approach to pregnancy			1
in her book , expecting @entity12 , she claims a glass of wine a day is fine , plenty of coffee wo n’t harm the baby and gaining too little weight while pregnant is far more worrying than gaining too much			2
safe ? according to @entity7 , a glass of wine a day is fine during the second and third trimesters the @entity25 - educated associate professor of economics at the @entity27 used her data skills to rewrite the rules of pregnancy			1
last night she told the @entity31 that food restrictions were ‘ overblown ’ and that alcohol consumption does not affect the iq or behaviour of the child			1
she said her book – which found the best studies often painted a different picture from official guidelines – was ‘ simply to show women the evidence and let them decide for themselves ’			1
miss @entity7 said : ‘ actually getting the numbers led me to a more relaxed place : a glass of wine every now and then , plenty of coffee , exercise when i wanted it			1
’ controversial : @entity7 's research contradicts received wisdom on drinking during pregnancy miss @entity7 ’s quest began when she became pregnant three years ago and was advised to give up her four cups of coffee a day			1
unwilling to do so and frustrated by ‘ one long list of rules ’ , she investigated and found that research linking coffee consumption to higher rates of miscarriage was flawed			1
she wrote in one article : ‘ i ultimately decided that the weight of evidence did n’t support limiting my consumption very much			2
’ her next port of call was alcohol			2
she looked at a study in the journal @entity70 , which had concluded that just one drink a day was enough to put unborn children at risk of behavioural problems			0
but the research did not reflect that 18 per cent of the women studied did n’t drink at all and 45 per cent of those who enjoyed a daily drink also took cocaine			0
she concluded that women should feel comfortable with one or two drinks a week during the first three months and up to one a day after that			0
her research found that dyeing hair was fine and there was little evidence that exercise , while not unsafe , had any benefits			2
but she found gardening could raise the risks of exposure to a toxoplasmosis parasite living in the soil			0
toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite and is acquired from contact with cats and their faeces			0
a woman contracting it just before or while pregnant can transmit it to her baby			0
miss @entity7 said : ‘ there is some risk to increase birth defects if you do a lot of outdoor gardening when you are pregnant			2
that can increase rates of toxoplasmosis			0
’ she discovered sushi was fine and sardines and herring were good for a child ’s iq , but advised against raw milk cheese			0
a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ drinking during pregnancy can be associated with miscarriage , foetal alcohol syndrome and low birth weight			1
’ ‘ our advice remains that women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant should avoid alcohol			0
’ @entity130 website founder , @entity129 , said : ‘ official guidelines may seem stringent but they are there to err on the side of absolute safety			1
’ expecting @entity12 : why the @entity135 is wrong - and what you really need to know , £ 10.04 , is released next week by @entity138 .			0

economist @entity7 analysed *hundreds* of *health* studies and journals
she found that many studies were flawed and did *n't* give the true picture
coffee , wine and deli meats such as *ham* are back on the menu
the @entity119 recommends limiting alcohol consumption
@entity130 founder @entity129 was *cautiously* welcoming
