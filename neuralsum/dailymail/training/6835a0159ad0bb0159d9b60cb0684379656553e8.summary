critic : author and educator @entity1 wrote a column for @entity4 arguing that college - age women often become victims of rape because they are naive about men 's true evil nature self - described ' dissident feminist ' @entity1 has written an op - ed piece for @entity4 arguing that female college students are naive and careless about the true nature of men as sexual predators			1
@entity1 , 67 , a professor at the @entity16 in @entity17 , penned the column this week in reaction to the recent abduction of @entity22 sophomore @entity21 , 18 , who was last seen two weeks ago in the company of a 32 - year - old nursing assistant			0
@entity25 was captured in @entity26 last week and charged with abduction with intent to defile , but so far there is no sign of @entity31			0
in her provocative opinion piece , @entity1 builds her argument on the premise that young , college - age women often become victims of sexual assault because they have a false sense of security and do not keep their guard up in public places			1
dismissing claims about an epidemic of sex assaults on campuses as ' wildly overblown , ' the well - respected social critic writes that the true danger to female students is ' the ancient sex crime of abduction and murder			1
' she goes so far as to say that colleges should stick to academics instead of lecturing students about sex assault , which in her mind is an exercise in futility			1
@entity1 essentially says that on a biological level , men are wild beasts driven by atavistic desires , and that our society has done women a great disservice by leading them to believe otherwise			1
' too many young middleclass women , raised far from the urban streets , seem to expect adult life to be an extension of their comfortable , overprotected homes , ' @entity1 says			2
' but the world remains a wilderness			0
the price of women ’s modern freedoms is personal responsibility for vigilance and self - defense			0
' @entity1 also takes a swipe at the @entity83 education system , accusing teachers and schoolbook authors of sanitizing history by removing any mention of ‘ horrors and atrocities ’ stemming from evil that it part and parcel of human nature			0
case in point : the op - ed piece was written in reaction to the abduction of 18 - year - old college sophomore @entity21 , who went missing two weeks ago in @entity100 after being last seen with an older man in her article for the @entity4 titled ' @entity104 not @entity103 , ' @entity1 argues that both the liberal and conservative worldviews are lacking a profound sense of evil because it is much easier to blame an outside force for all our troubles			1
@entity1 's possibly most controversial point is that critics and thinkers debating gender ideology erroneously think that the fundamental nature of man can be changed for the better , and that their violent instincts can somehow be tamed with the help of campus initiative and well - meaning speeches			2
‘ but extreme sex crimes like rape - murder emanate from a primitive level that even practical psychology no longer has a language for , ’ she states			0
according to the renowned feminist author , an ' alienated loser ' motivated by an ancient hunting reflex would prey on an unsuspecting , random woman simply to live out a sexual fantasy , or to punish the female sex for his own failures			0
@entity1 concludes : ‘ young women do not see the animal eyes glowing at them in the dark			1
controversial : @entity1 , 67 , argued that @entity83 's educators of every stripe are doing womne a disservice by making them believe that man 's sexual desires can be tamed ‘ they assume that bared flesh and sexy clothes are just a fashion statement containing no messages that might be misread and twisted by a psychotic			2
’ @entity1 is the author of the much - talked - about 1990 bestseller @entity148 , in which she argues that the human nature has an inherently dangerous aspect to it , especially when it comes to sexuality			2
in 2005 , she was named as one of the top 100 public intellectuals by the journals @entity157 and @entity158 .			0
