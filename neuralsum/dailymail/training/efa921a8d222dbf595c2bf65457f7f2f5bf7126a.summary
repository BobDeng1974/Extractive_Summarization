in a further sign of @entity5 ’s difficulties over tax , mr @entity0 was embarrassed over a £ 1.6million donation from shopping channel tycoon @entity26 , who gave the money in shares in order to reduce the tax bill			1
mr @entity0 sheepishly described the donation as ‘ tax efficient ’ , and suggested the tax saved was ‘ small beer compared to what the @entity34 get up to ’			2
@entity5 ’s credibility on the issue was further rocked by a series of revelations about the tax affairs of other major donors , including businessmen sir @entity42 and @entity44 and business adviser @entity45			1

deeds of variation are entirely legal , but were described as ‘ tax abuse ’ by @entity67 when he was @entity69			2
and mr @entity0 yesterday ducked questions about whether his leader had acted morally , saying : ‘ i think that @entity1 paid all the tax which was due			1

he added that taxpayers will ask ‘ why should i spend more money on politicians … particularly politicians i do n’t even support ? ’ ‘ there is an open question as to whether @entity1 avoided the full inheritance tax liability he owed by using a deed of variation			1

mr @entity1 sold his share to his brother in 2004 , and said he paid capital gains tax on it			2
the @entity5 leader said at the weekend he is ‘ not backing down ’ in his campaign against tax avoidance but some @entity5 figures are nervous that the crusade could backfire if it sparks an examination of the tax affairs of big @entity5 donors and senior @entity5 politicians			1
