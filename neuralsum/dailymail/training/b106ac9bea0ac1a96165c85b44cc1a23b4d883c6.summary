it 's fair to say that friday is @entity1 's favourite day of the week			1
not because it 's the end of the working week but because it 's the day he can suit up in his fluro gear and head out into the surf			0
it may sound like fun and games but this is a project that the 33 - year - old has been working on since march 2013 with a serious message behind it			2
when the avid surfer found out he had bipolar disorder two years ago , it was the waves of the ocean that helped him get through his condition			1
' when i got myself out there into the surf , i was able to forget about everything , ' he told @entity25			0
' each wave would keep me going			0
being in the ocean helped me get through it			2
so it took one wave to give me hope again			0

@entity46 fell on a friday and the @entity35 community were keen to support and raise awareness for the cause			1
' we had the biggest turn out today with over 200 people showing up at @entity39 , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' i ca n't believe how far it 's [ @entity33 ] come because i started it just hoping that we could help people and introduce them to surfing as a way of coping			0
' he says participants dressed in fluro , like every other friday , but this time they held hands and stood along the shoreline to create a wave			2
they then held a minute silence for those who had lost their battle with mental illness			0
