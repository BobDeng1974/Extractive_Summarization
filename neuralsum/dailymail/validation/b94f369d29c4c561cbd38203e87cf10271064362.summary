this was the biggest night of @entity2 ’s extraordinary breakthrough season , so how did the @entity4 striker cope with the famed @entity6 brand of defending on his full debut ? all systems go credit to @entity10 for abandoning his original system in the 54th minute			1
it simply was n’t working with @entity13 up front with @entity2			0
@entity14 replaced him and @entity15 , a peripheral first half figure , was promoted up front to partner @entity2			1
that bold and decisive move gave this more physical duo far more presence in their battle with @entity24 ’s three - man defensive shield			0
@entity2 grapples with @entity25 and @entity26 as the @entity4 man makes a nuisance of himself @entity2 has a dig from outside the area as @entity4 press for an equaliser in the second half @entity2 and @entity36 team - mate @entity35 beam at the final whistle after @entity4 's 1 - 1 draw in @entity39 ‘ we struggled physically in the second half , ’ admitted @entity24 coach @entity40			1
@entity2 had a couple of decent chances , one deflected away for a corner and another saved well by @entity26 when he fed off the scraps from @entity35 ’s shots			2
the beauty of this boy @entity2 is that he shows no fear , standing tall with the rest of this @entity4 team as they fought their way back into this game			1
at the final whistle , @entity26 embraced the @entity36 striker before he walked towards the @entity4 fans to salute them for travelling to @entity39 for this friendy			1
he belongs in this company			0
@entity6 marking prince @entity2 had @entity61 marking him throughout the first half and he was so tight to the @entity4 forward it was skin - on - skin at times			1
@entity61 , along with his central defensive partner @entity66 is part of a @entity69 team who are top of @entity71 and have only conceded 14 goals in the league			2
you do n’t get much change out of these two , especially at international level			0
it is almost a criminal act for an @entity6 defender to concede a goal , no matter what the circumstances or the occasion			0
@entity2 is sandwiched by @entity61 and @entity66 as @entity24 defend a high ball @entity66 keeps @entity2 under wraps as the @entity4 man struggles for space in the area @entity40 ’s team spend hours on the practice pitches going through defensive drills , denying opposition players space in the areas where they can be hurt the most			1
@entity15 had warned this @entity4 team about the dirty tricks , but @entity24 have turned defending in to an art form over the years			1
they are masters of their trade			0
this is part of @entity2 ’s education , working out ways to unsettle @entity24 ’s three man defence and pulling at least one of them out of position to open up some space in central areas			0
starved of service @entity2 's biggest contribution to the first half was his knock - down for @entity13 ’s effort that rebounded to @entity15 lurking just inside the penalty area			1
@entity4 ’s captain hit the bar			0
that was better , getting the ball in to dangerous areas of the field for @entity2 to finally do some damage			0
still , it was hard to get away from the statistics			0
@entity2 leaps for a corner but the ball is punched away but @entity24 's veteran keeper @entity26 @entity2 attempts to rob @entity126 of possession during a tricky night in @entity39 by the time the @entity4 team walked off the pitch at half - time in the @entity131 , when they were losing 1 - 0 , @entity2 had only touched the ball 15 times , @entity13 had 13			1
that is not nearly enough at this level			0
the alternative is to stay on the last man , as he did after the break by treading on the toes of @entity66 , his designated second half marker , and acting as a target man			2
the change gave @entity4 options and @entity2 ’s effort at the start of the second half would have troubled @entity24 ’s legendary keeper @entity26 , but it was deflected wide for a corner			1
that was the week this time last year @entity2 had scored just two goals in his entire career for @entity36 : one against @entity154 in the @entity155 and another against @entity156 in the @entity157			0
this has been a momentous week in @entity2 ’s life and he returns to @entity36 ’ s training ground to prepare for sunday ’s clash with @entity162 as a full international			2
@entity2 trudges back to the half way line after @entity4 fell behind in the first - half @entity2 has a go from outside the box but failed to get on the scoresheet against the wily @entity6 after scoring 29 times for @entity36 this season , plus another on his debut for the national team against @entity173 at @entity174 last friday , he remains very much man of the moment			1
even at 21 he looks like a man who can take it all in his stride and there is even the possibility that he will be named @entity183 player of the year or @entity185 footballer of the year in may			0
under 21 dilemma @entity187 will hold more talks with the @entity36 forward , but there is pressure from within @entity174 for @entity2 to commit to the under 21 tournament this summer			0
@entity2 has represented @entity4 at various levels throughout his international career and it will send a strong message to players that they are expected to play in summer tournaments			2
@entity2 looks up after finally evading @entity66 's attentions as the @entity4 man looks for attacking options @entity2 is kept at arm 's length by @entity66 as the @entity69 defender keeps a close eye on the @entity4 man the @entity36 forward has played an awful lot of football this season , but there is a real momentum building with the under 21 team after their fine comeback and eventual victory over @entity215 at the @entity216 on monday evening			1
with @entity2 in the @entity219 this summer , along with @entity217 forward @entity218 , @entity4 would have one of the most potent attacking partnerships at the tournament .			2

@entity2 had a tough first half on his full @entity4 debut but when @entity10 put @entity15 *alongside* him , it yielded *dividends*
@entity2 *regularly* found himself with @entity61 and @entity66 for company
@entity2 showed no fear , standing tall with the rest of this @entity4 team as they fought their way back into this game
at the end of the game he was embraced by @entity26
