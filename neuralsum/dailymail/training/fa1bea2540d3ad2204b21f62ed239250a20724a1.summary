by @entity0 published : 14:11 est , 8 april 2012 updated : 03:25 est , 9 april 2012 disturbing footage has emerged allegedly showing @entity3 troops beating an anti-government rebel in the suburbs of the country 's capital , @entity8			1
the mobile video , which came to light yesterday , has not yet been verified			0
it shows a man lying face down on a dusty floor , his hands behind his back as three others - two of them wearing fatigues - stand on his neck and back , kicking him and hitting him with a small club			0
president @entity34 's government made a new last minute demand that its opponents provide ' written guarantees ' to lay down their weapons before regime forces withdraw from cities - a call swiftly rejected by the country 's main rebel group			1
it came amid claims that heavy fighting during the past week has led to 1,000 deaths			1
the deal , brokered by @entity49 and @entity51 envoy @entity50 , was due to take effect on tuesday , paving the way for negotiations to end the country 's year - old crisis , which the @entity49 estimates has killed 9,000 people			0
mr @entity50 said last week that the @entity3 president had accepted the plan and its call for government forces to pull back from urban centres			1
but yesterday @entity3 's @entity64 spokesman , @entity63 , placed a new condition - that the opposition agree in writing ' to halt violence with all its forms and their readiness to lay down weapons			1
' the commander of the rebel @entity72 , @entity73 , said his group was prepared to abide by the @entity50 agreement , but rejected the government 's new unilateral demand			2
the @entity72 does not recognise the regime ' and for that reason we will not give guarantees , ' he said , adding the government should withdraw its forces to bases and remove checkpoints from streets			2
mr @entity50 's deal calls for government forces to withdraw from population centres on tuesday , to be followed by a full ceasefire by both sides by 6am on thursday			1
even before the setback , expectations were low that the @entity34 regime would honor the agreement			1
fighting : an armoured vehicle belonging to the @entity3 army is seen in the @entity99 district of @entity100 yesterday on the brink : a peace deal is close to collapse as demonstrators protest against president @entity34 's regime in @entity106 , near @entity107 yesterday @entity108 , an @entity34 ally that supports the cease - fire plan , may now be the only one able to salvage it			1
the rest of the international community , unwilling to contemplate military intervention , has little leverage over @entity3			0
however , in recent days , @entity3 forces have stepped up shelling attacks on restive towns , and activists say scores of civilians have been killed daily - at least 100 on saturday alone			1
mr @entity50 said in a statement that ' the present escalation of violence is unacceptable '			0
he also reminded the government ' of the need for full implementation of its commitments , ' though it was unclear whether his statement was issued before or after @entity8 imposed new conditions for complying with the truce			0
activists said at least 21 people were killed in violence yesterday			2
fighting : a building is damaged in the @entity99 district of @entity100 in this newly - released picture from friday following reports of a crackdown by @entity34 forces in addition to demanding written guarantees from the opposition , @entity64 spokesman @entity63 said @entity3 also wants assurances from @entity50 that @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 's most active critics - halt ' financing and arming of terrorist groups			1
' @entity145 and @entity147 are said to be creating a multimillion pound fund to pay rebel fighters , while @entity146 has floated the idea of creating buffer zones for refugees in @entity3 territory , near the @entity146 border			0
many had expected the @entity34 regime to stall and create new obstacles to a truce because it has little to fear from the international community , said @entity162 , an analyst at the @entity163 think tank			2
' nothing seems to have a price tag , ' he said , noting that regime has been accused of shelling whole neighborhoods , exacting collective punishment and driving people out of their homes			0
burnt out : another @entity25 clip uploaded earlier this week shows the debris of a destroyed vehicle ( left ) and a burning car allegedly caught in shelling by @entity3 government forces in @entity178 mourning : yet more @entity25 footage from this week shows @entity3 carrying the coffins of people allegedly killed by regime forces in @entity183 , near the capital @entity8 the regime might also be reluctant to move forward for fear of losing control			1
while @entity50 's plan calls for eventual negotiations between the government and the opposition over @entity3 's political future , anti-regime activists say huge numbers of protesters would probably flood the streets and quickly topple @entity34 if he were forced to halt his yearlong crackdown			1
@entity63 , the @entity3 official , suggested that a truce without guarantees would give rebels the upper hand			2
he said @entity3 will not allow a repeat of what happened during the @entity51 's observer mission in @entity3 in january , when @entity34 pulled back his forces , only to see rebels flood the vacated areas			1
the @entity3 foreign minister is expected in @entity209 on monday , but it is not clear whether @entity108 will step in to try to salvage the @entity50 plan it had supported enthusiastically			0
activists said rebel fighters shot down a @entity3 army helicopter with a heavy machine gun in northwestern @entity107 province yesterday			2
running battles : smoke rises from a building in the @entity99 district of @entity100 yesterday some of the heaviest fighting of the day was in @entity100 , where government troops attacked several rebel - held neighborhoods , said @entity226 , the local activist			2
in the @entity229 neighborhood , 40 bodies were piled in a room in a makeshift hospital because the constant shelling has prevented burials , he said , adding that activists are aiming fans at the corpses so they wo n't decompose quickly			0
' we might have to bury them in public gardens , ' he said			0
near the capital of @entity8 , government troops raided the suburbs of @entity243 , @entity183 and @entity244			0
the grass - roots @entity245 put the day 's death toll on the opposition side at 45 , including six children			0
it said nine people were killed in @entity100 and 13 in @entity252 , among them seven members of one family			0
the @entity256 reported at least 21 civilians killed in fighting and shelling by government forces , along with seven rebel fighters and 12 soldiers			1
