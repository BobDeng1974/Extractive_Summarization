an @entity1 college and a retired architect are embroiled in an absurd row over a stretch of scrubby bushes which are quickly becoming ' the most expensive hedge in @entity7 '			1
in a court case likely to cost £ 150,000 , @entity8 and a 74 - year - old businessman have been locked in a battle over an unkempt hedgerow between their properties in @entity7			1

hedge row : @entity16 and @entity24 , @entity1 are embroiled in a row over a stretch of scrubby bushes , with a court case likely to cost £ 150,000 the bizarre dispute began when @entity16 decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180 - yard hedge , which marks the boundary between his home and the college 's land before starting the work , mr @entity16 thought it best to consult with the college - which is one of the largest landowners in the country - on where exactly he should replant the hedge , so to avoid any costly complications further down the line			1
but he claims @entity42 's has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court , the @entity41 reported			2
the hedge , which dates back to 1686 , divides mr @entity16 's one - acre plot from 1,200 acres of farmland owned by the college			1
mr @entity16 said : ' as it stands this ancient hedge is in a poor state of repair and is an eyesore			2
i 'm more than happy to pay for the work to restore the hedge and improve and safeguard the rural environment around me , but i need @entity42 's to agree the boundary line – and they just wo n't sit down and discuss the issue face to face			2
they 've ignored all my approaches and left me with no choice but to go to court			0
' i want to do this properly			0
if i went ahead and did the work without establishing where precisely the boundary lies i could end up creating all sort of problems which would see the college coming after me in future			0
' a crown court judge said the bushes were quickly becoming ' the most expensive hedge in @entity7 ' mr @entity16 claims @entity24 ( pictured ) has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court the retired businessman , who lives with his wife @entity79 , 75 , commissioned a report on the scrubby bushes , with experts recommending repairing the ' neglected , sparse ' hedge			1
the report stated that fixing the hedgerow would encourage birds to nest , as well as providing habitats for other wildlife			0
