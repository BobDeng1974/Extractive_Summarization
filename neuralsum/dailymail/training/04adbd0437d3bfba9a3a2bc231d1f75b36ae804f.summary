by @entity0 rise : @entity1 is now worth £ 5.6billion , £ 2.3billion more than its initial value taxpayers had a raw deal from the sale of @entity1 because it was priced too cheaply , the @entity6 will say today			1
the government ’s spending watchdog said the controversial privatisation was ‘ marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer ’			2
in october , the @entity1 was floated on the stock market at a price of £ 3.3billion			1
today it is worth £ 5.6billion – a gap of £ 2.3billion			1
on the first day of trading , about £ 750million ‘ flowed to the new shareholders ’ – mainly @entity19 investors who benefited from an instant 38 per cent share price rise			1
the @entity6 concludes : ‘ @entity23 could have achieved better value for the taxpayer			1
’ last night @entity26 mp , chairman of the @entity27 , accused the @entity23 of having ‘ had no clue what it was doing ’			0
describing the sale as a ‘ second - class performance ’ , she said : ‘ it is clear to me the @entity23 under - sold the taxpayer when it privatised @entity1			0
’ but business minister @entity34 dismissed the criticism , saying : ‘ hindsight is a wonderful thing			0
’ he added : ‘ we were cautious to avoid the risk of this transaction falling over			0
if we had put it on the market at a much higher price , we would have been left with a fatally damaged @entity1			1
’ today ’s @entity6 report says the government met its ‘ primary objective ’ of selling the postal giant before the election in may 2015			1
but it also lays bare the extent to which the @entity19 hit the jackpot from the sale – and damningly concludes the government should cut its reliance on @entity19 advisers before any future flotations			0
when the shares went on the market , private investors were allowed to buy a maximum of £ 750 worth , but an exclusive group of 16 of the @entity19 ’s biggest names were given ‘ priority ’ status and allowed to buy up to £ 46million worth each			1
criticism : @entity26 mp , chairman of the @entity27 , accused @entity53 of having ' no clue what it was doing ' but business minister @entity34 said : ' hindsight is a wonderful thing ' when the @entity1 floated last year , business secretary @entity70 said he was looking for long - term stability from ‘ the right kind of investor community ’			2
as a result , 16 of the @entity19 ’s investment giants were singled out from the 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status			0
this group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £ 46million worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £ 600,000 and £ 6million worth			1
but few of the ‘ priority ’ investors – believed to include @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 – have been as long - term in their approach as mr @entity70 had hoped			2
the @entity6 said : ‘ almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks			2
’ in one example , @entity94 bought nearly 12million shares in october , but now owns just 118,480			0
speaking to mps in october , business secretary @entity70 justified the arrangement by saying he wanted to attract ‘ the right kind of investor community ’ , which was about ‘ long - termism ’			0
but today ’s report reveals many of the ‘ priority ’ investors then rushed to sell their shares , making themselves a fortune as the share price rocketed from £ 3.30 to more than £ 6			1
of the 16 , six had sold 100 per cent of their shares ‘ within the first few weeks of trading ’ , according to the @entity6			2
yesterday mr @entity70 insisted : ‘ achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale			0
‘ the report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high			0
’ @entity118 , head of the @entity6 , said the @entity23 had been ‘ very keen ’ to sell @entity1 in order to prevent the company becoming a burden on the taxpayer			2
but he added : ‘ its approach , however , was marked by deep caution , the price of which was borne by the taxpayer			0
’ in order to sell the business , the @entity6 said @entity1 ’s £ 8.6billion pension black hole had also been given to the taxpayer			1
while it has received £ 28.8billion of assets from the pension fund , it has also been left with £ 37.4billion of liabilities , which are the pension promises made to @entity1 ’s workers			0
last year , it emerged that @entity137 , one of the banks which ran the sale on behalf of the government , had considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered from £ 3.30 to £ 3.50 just days before the flotation			2
but it then decided the move was too risky , and warned mr @entity70 against increasing the share price – advice which he followed			1
@entity148 , chief executive of @entity149 , the investment bank which advised the government on the sale , insisted it was the ‘ maximum price achievable ’ at the time			0
mr @entity148 said : ‘ there was no clear ability to go above £ 3.30 at that particular time			0
’ last night , @entity1 shares were worth £ 5.63 each			1
returns : city investors benefited from an instant 38 per cent share price rise on the first day of trading			1

postal *service* was floated on stock market in october , valued at £ 3.3bn
today it *'s* worth £ 5.6bn and investors have benefited from share price hike
@entity6 claim it was priced too cheaply and could have achieved ' better value for taxpayers '
