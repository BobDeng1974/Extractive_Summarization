@entity1 's @entity0 reveals all about his career so far			1
from quality coffee , @entity4 and @entity5 to @entity6 , the @entity7 win and wanting to be a black cab driver ... @entity1 's @entity0 reveals all about his career so far before the @entity10 internationals who is your sporting hero ? @entity6			1
the way he was able to stay at the top of his sport and profession for so long , while facing so much adversity , is really impressive			2
@entity20 and @entity21 , two of my team - mates , have tried out boxing but it ’s never crossed my mind to get in the ring			1
it would be pretty daunting ! what would you be if you were n't a sportsman ? when i left school i worked as a barista in a cafe			2
there are n’t too many cappuccino drinkers back home — i sharpened my skills on a latte or a flat white ! i was always into @entity40 at school and i enjoyed @entity42 as well			2
career highlight ? the @entity7 win			1
i got the call - up late because of an injury but it was really special to win it in our home country			1
like many , @entity6 is @entity0 's sporting hero , but he has never tried boxing and the worst moment ? probably that @entity7 final because it was a little bittersweet			1
i had to go off after about 30 minutes with an injury			2
i hyper - extended my knee and that was the end of my game			2
if your house was burning down , what one possession would you save ? is it a bit boring to say an @entity1 jersey ? maybe an @entity1 jersey and a spare pair of undies , because you never know when they could come in handy			1
what ’s the best advice you 've ever been given ? it ’s a bit of a cliche but you ’ve always got to chase your dreams and follow your heart			2
if you ’re eager to achieve something do n’t let anyone tell you any different			0
that ’s what my good old mum told me and it ’s kept me in pretty good stead			0
last film you saw ? it was @entity87 that stars @entity5			0
it ’s an old one but a goodie			0
i watched it on the flight to @entity93 from @entity1			1
some of the taller boys struggle to sleep on planes but i find it quite luxurious with the space we get			0
@entity4 in the @entity99 is the @entity1 fly - half 's favourite holiday destination favourite pre-match meal ? i have some mashed spuds with baked beans , poached eggs , avocado and chicken			1
it generally stays the same and it ’s usually cooked for us in the hotel			0
that ’s what i would have on game day			0
your favourite holiday destination ? @entity4 near @entity117 is an amazing place			0
it ’s part of the @entity99 islands and is about a seven - hour flight from @entity1			1
it really is a beautiful part of the world , surrounded by a reef			0
in a film of your life , who would you like to play you ? @entity5 would be pretty cool			0
he ’s a bit of a dude and you never see him in a bad movie			0
i do n’t see myself as a cool dude but he is , so i ’ll pick him ! he would want @entity134 actor @entity5 ( left ) to play him in a film about his life tell us a secret ... if i tell you it ’s not really a secret is it ? ! my mum does n’t do my washing or anything like that			0
i was lying about what job i wanted to do when i was younger — i actually wanted to be a black - cab driver in @entity149 ! if you are planning a trip to @entity4 like @entity0 , make sure you are covered with @entity153 travel insurance			1
@entity153 are the @entity154 of @entity1 @entity155 .			1
