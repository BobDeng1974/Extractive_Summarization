from sweltering in the summer to being crushed into a sweaty man ’s armpit at rush hour , many of the world ’s antiquated underground rail networks are in need of an overhaul			0
now futuristic images of what @entity10 ’s tube trains might look like have been revealed – and they include features that are set to make journeys more comfortable and reliable for passengers			1
the 250 sleek new trains will be driverless - similar to the current @entity17 trains - and will grace the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23 lines as soon as 2025			1
this will make them similar to the new batch of carriages recently introduced on the @entity39 and @entity40 and @entity23 lines			2
but most importantly , they will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays			0
the 250 sleek new trains will be driverless and will grace the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23 lines as soon as 2025			1
this image shows what the interior might look like the trains will be driverless and run with new signalling systems to cut delays			2
at first , drivers will take control of the new trains but the plan is to make them fully autonomous carriages will feature air - cooling for the first time on deep sections of the @entity58			2
they will be more accessible - with step - free access from the platform , walk - through carriages and wider doors			1
the trains are designed to be driverless , but when they first enter service they will have an operator on board			2
along with modernised signal systems , they will enable faster , more frequent and reliable services with fewer delays			0
their design is futuristic with echoes of the @entity77 's heritage			0
the next generation underground trains will come in to service from the mid- 2020s			0
they will run on the @entity21 line , followed by the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity82 lines			1
the trains are designed to last for at least 40 years			0
they will boost capacity by 25 % on the @entity20 and @entity19 lines , 50 % on the @entity82 and 60 % on the @entity21 line			1
at first , drivers will take control of the new trains , which have been designed by @entity10 's @entity91 , but the plan is to make them fully autonomous			1
@entity94 ( @entity94 ) said : ‘ we would only consider implementing full automation following extensive engagement with our customers , stakeholders , staff and trade unions			0
’ capacity will grow by 25 per cent on the @entity20 and @entity19 lines , 50 per cent on the @entity102 and up to 60 per cent on the @entity21 line			1
this is to cope with @entity10 ’s growing population , which is expected to increase to 10 million in 2030 ` these innovative , eye - catching and sleek new trains will be vital for the continued modernisation of @entity77 , ’ said the mayor of @entity10 , @entity107			2
‘ they will ferry millions of people across our city , more comfortably , reliably and stylishly than ever before			0
' @entity58 marks a significant step forward in giving @entity113 and visitors the accessible and modern transport service that they expect and deserve			0
‘ these beautiful , air - cooled machines represent the best of @entity119 design and innovation			0
' they will help to keep @entity10 and its economy moving in the right direction			0
' capacity will grow by 25 per cent on the @entity20 and @entity19 lines , 50 per cent on the @entity102 and up to 60 per cent on the @entity21 line			1
walk - though carriages ( pictured ) will also ease congestion for passengers the trains ( pictured ) will be high capacity , cooler – thanks to air conditioning – and have walk - through carriages to make travelling around @entity10 more comfortable for @entity113 and visitors to the capital			1

futuristic designs were made by @entity91 , based in @entity10
tube trains are designed to be driverless and operational in 2025
they will run on the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity82 lines
trains will have walk - through carriages and air conditioning
capacity will grow on all the lines to cater for an *expanding* population
