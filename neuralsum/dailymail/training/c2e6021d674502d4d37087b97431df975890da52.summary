by @entity1 reporter published : 07:30 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 22 march 2013 for many fathers , the prospect of telling their sons about the meaning of life induces apprehension			1
but when @entity10 shared the secret of life with his 12 - year - old son @entity13 , it was a hugely exciting moment			1
after all , he had just discovered it			2
a letter from the famed @entity17 scientist to his son has come to light in which he describes his groundbreaking model of dna weeks before it was made public			1
a letter by the famed @entity17 scientist @entity10 ( pictured ) to his son @entity13 ( pictured ) in which he reveals for the first time the discovery of dna , has come to light in the handwritten letter , tipped to sell for £ 1.5million , the biologist writes of having made ' a most important discovery ' at a research lab in @entity35			1
he would go on to win a @entity36 for his work , which revolutionised our understanding of genetics			2
in the letter , dr @entity10 explains in depth the dna double helix structure , the so - called ' blueprint for life '			1
he says : ' we have built a model for the structure of des - oxy - ribose - nucleic - acid , called dna for short			2
in other words we think we have found the basic copying mechanism by which life comes from life			1
' dr @entity10 also drew a rudimentary diagram , telling @entity13 : ' read this carefully so you understand it			2
' he signed the letter , dated march 19 , 1953 , ' lots of love , @entity59 '			1
dr @entity10 , who was from @entity61 but emigrated to @entity62 , died in 2004 aged 88			2
a letter by famed @entity17 scientist @entity10 to his 12 - year - old son in which he reveals for the first time the discovery of @entity29			1
the handwritten letter is tipped to sell at auction for £ 1.5 million in the letter he explains in - depth the make - up and code of the @entity29 helix structure or the so - called blueprint to life			1
and he instructed @entity13 to carefully study the dna structure so that he ' understood ' it			2
@entity78 , now 72 and living in @entity79 , kept the letter , and will sell it at auction in @entity82 to mark 60 years since the discovery			1
he said : ' my father believed that @entity29 contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared his enthusiasm with me			2
' everything came together in february 1953 when my father and ( fellow scientist ) @entity93 were given the go - ahead to try and construct a model of @entity29			1
@entity78 - computer game pioneer and son of @entity29 scientist @entity10 ' my father 's enthusiasm could not be contained			1
the story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub called the @entity103 and announcing to all who would listen that he had found “ the secret of life ”			1
then on march 19 my father wrote to me describing the model and its implications			1
i was 12 at the time and away at @entity110 – the @entity17 boarding school			2
' when i returned to @entity35 my father very proudly showed me the model			0
' the excitement of the event was beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter summarising the discovery in seven simple pages			1
' mr @entity10 said part of the proceeds from the sale will go to an institute dedicated to brain research , another area in which his father worked			0
dr @entity10 carried out his research on @entity29 with fellow scientists @entity129 and @entity131			0
the three won the @entity36 for physiology and medicine in 1962			0
attempting to put his work in simple terms , dr @entity10 wrote to his son that @entity29 could be thought of as a ' very long chain with flat bits sticking out , called the “ bases ” '			1
he said : ' we have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a helix – and the chain , made up of sugar and phosphorus , is on the outside and the bases are all on the inside			0
' now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together			0
' the auction is being held by @entity159 in @entity82 on april 10			0
@entity29 , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life			1
two @entity35 scientists , @entity129 and @entity10 , first described its famous double - helix structure in 1953 , changing the face of biology for ever			2
the complete set of @entity29 instructions that makes us what we are is known as the @entity171			0
within it , there are 2.9 billion chemical " letters "			0
certain sequences of these letters make up the genes , the " software " that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body			0
working out the entire pattern of @entity29 in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon			0
a dna molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder			0
the sides of the ladder , made of sugar and phosphate molecules , are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases			0
four different bases are present in dna , and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code			0
they are adenine ( a ) , thymine ( @entity203 ) , cytosine ( c ) and guanine ( @entity206 )			0
the two dna strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand , forming base pairs			0
genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs			0
in the case of the human genome , the figure is 2.9 billion .			0

he wrote ' we think we have found the basic copying mechanism by which life comes from life '
he signed off the letter , dated march 19 , 1953 , ' lots of love , daddy '
son @entity78 is selling letter to mark 60th *anniversary* of discovery
