by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:56 pm on 2nd november 2011 sailing across the @entity2 would be a gruelling task for the fittest of men			0
but @entity6 managed the feat in his private yacht – despite claiming he was unfit to work because of a bad back			0
the 57 - year - old tackled some of the world ’s most dangerous waters while claiming thousands of pounds in incapacity benefit over a 15 - year period			1
picture of health : @entity18 sailor @entity6 sailing near the @entity19 ... despite claiming benefits for a bad back he was caught out when it emerged he had made a month - long voyage from @entity23 to the @entity19			1
the benefits claimant also lived in a council house in @entity26 , @entity27 , despite part - owning a farmhouse in @entity29			2
mr @entity6 was apparently exposed living a double - life by a @entity32 investigation , which airs tonight			2
the keen sailor started receiving incapacity benefit in 1996 , after injuring his back in a motorcycle accident			1
but mr @entity6 continued to sail extensively and , in 2003 , he set off from @entity37 in his yacht on a four - week @entity2 crossing			2
accompanied by one crew member , he sailed via the @entity41 , before tackling the huge swells of the @entity2			0
it is then thought that he sailed from the @entity19 to @entity44			2
according to the programme , mr @entity6 was given a council flat in 1997 after failing to tell the local authority that he half - owned a house in @entity29			0
intrepid : mr @entity6 was apparently exposed living a double - life by a @entity32 investigation he then held on to the council property while also living in the @entity23 and @entity44			1
in the programme , mr @entity6 admits to a @entity32 investigator that he has been mostly based in the @entity23 for the past seven years			1
