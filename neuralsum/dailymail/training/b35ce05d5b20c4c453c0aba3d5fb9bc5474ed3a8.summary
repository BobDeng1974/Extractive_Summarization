the myth of the ' mean girl ' has finally been debunked , with new research proving that it is boys who are more likely to spread malicious rumors , be manipulative and reject or exclude others at school			1
according to researchers from the @entity9 , who asked 620 randomly - selected students to complete an annual survey every year between the ages of 11 and 18 , it is young boys who are more likely to engage in these behaviors – categorized as ‘ relational aggression ’ – and who are more likely to be the victims of such abuse			1
of the children surveyed , a large majority , both boys and girls , claimed that it was male students , in every grade , from six through 12 , who often engaged in socially aggressive behavior , rather than the females			1
nasty : new research shows that it is boys who are more likely to spread malicious rumors , be manipulative and reject or exclude others at school however , the analysis also showed that the number of boys who felt victimized by their fellow classmates significantly decreased over the seven - year period , whereas the number of girls who were victims of moderate to high degrees of bullying remained more of less the same during that time			1
professor @entity44 , who led the study , said : ' overall , we found relational aggression to be a very common behavior			2
' she added that 96per cent of the students surveyed had passed a rumor or made a nasty comment about someone over the course of the study			0
experiences of some form of victimization were found to be universal as well , with over 90per cent of the students reporting that they had been victims of social aggression at least once , according to the report , which was published in the journal @entity60			0
queen bees : the idea that girls are more likely to be socially aggressive is perpetuated by stereotypes found in pop culture , for example the 2004 movie @entity68 ( pictured ) dr @entity44 added : ' we have books , websites and conferences aimed at stopping girls from being aggressive , as well as a lot of qualitative research on why girls are relationally aggressive			2
' but oddly enough , we do n’t have enough research on why boys would be relationally aggressive because people have assumed it ’s a girl behavior			0
' she explained that much more research is necessary to understand why girls are more likely than boys to be targets of aggression or to perceive certain acts as aggressive			0
' while the study may call for more scholarship on " mean boys " and why they behave the way they do , the findings ultimately emphasize a need to include boys and girls equally in programs aimed at reducing relational aggression , ' she said			2
' in the end , i think we need to ask how we can focus on increasing the positive interactions among kids rather than the negative ones , because the kids that students admire are often the ones who are fun and positive about others			0

a new study at the @entity9 found that boys aged 11 - 18 were more likely than girls to spread rumors and exclude other children
