by @entity0 @entity1 continued to lead the chase for the @entity4 title - and an open championship place - with a third - round 67 at @entity6			1
the 31 - year - old has never even recorded a top - three finish in his six seasons on the @entity10 but put himself in prime position to break his duck by advancing to 12 under par in @entity14 and a two - stroke lead over nearest challenger @entity16			1
an opening birdie on day three was offset by a poor chip at the third but the rest of his front nine was exemplary , starting with a calm 10 - foot putt at the fourth to move under par again			0
eyes on the prize : @entity1 leads the @entity4 heading into the final round a precise spinning approach to the ninth set up a birdie and an outward nine of 32 shots			1
his pitch onto the green at the par - five 12th struck the pin and set up a short birdie putt , and he holed a good left - to - right breaker at the next to move four under par for the day			0
a miss from 12 feet at the 15th was the one blemish thereafter but the former @entity39 lieutenant will be happy with his efforts			0
with @entity48 places on offer to the top four finishers not already qualified - so long as they are in the top @entity51 has a fine chance of a place at @entity43 , albeit with plenty of challengers waiting for him to slip up			1
open possibility : @entity1 looks set to qualify for next week 's @entity53 at @entity43 second - placed @entity16 has no such concerns , the @entity55 already in the field for a shot at his third major to add to the @entity48 and 2009 masters			1
he was 10 under after three trips round @entity61 , his third a fine 64 which finished on a high with birdies at 16 and 17 including a huge breaking right - to - left putt from 30 feet on the former hole			2
@entity16 aside , though , @entity66 was the only member of the top 11 not playing for an @entity48 place			1
the @entity70 @entity69 player was one of seven players at eight under , a shot behind @entity73 who held third place outright after a one - under - par 69			0
in contention : @entity70 @entity69 star @entity66 is the only member of the top 11 already qualified @entity66 is alongside compatriots @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity83 's @entity82			2
@entity80 produced one of the shots of the day off the 18th tee , spinning his yellow ball to within six inches before tapping in for a closing birdie			0
@entity89 was alone on seven under with seven players sharing 12th place on six under			0
five of those - @entity94 's @entity93 , @entity96 @entity95 and @entity70 @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 - are among the host of players chasing a trip to @entity103 , though @entity104 and @entity105 are merely warming up for the @entity107 event .			2

@entity1 has two - stroke lead heading into final round
@entity1 needs to finish in the top 12 to qualify for next week 's @entity48
