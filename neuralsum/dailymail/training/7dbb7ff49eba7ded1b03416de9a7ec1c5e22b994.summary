by @entity0 - parkinson published : 07:12 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 07:14 est , 20 april 2012 a corner shop owner embarked on a life of luxury with his wife by executing a ' @entity6 and @entity7 ' fraud worth £ 700,000			1
@entity8 , 39 , and his 41 - year old wife @entity9 pocketed almost £ 100,000 in tax credits for their four children by saying he was broke and earned only £ 5,000 a year			1
at the same time the couple claimed they were earning £ 100,000 a year using false references to fraudulently claim a string of mortgage loans			1
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) told authorities they earned just £ 5,000 but they told banks they earned £ 100,000 to fraudulently claim benefits and secure loans to buy businesses , cars and houses they owned two homes , two businesses and drove a @entity29 worth £ 62,000 and a £ 38,000 @entity30			1
the couple lived in a neat £ 200,000 semi-detached house in a cul - de - sac in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity9 set up her own fashion business			1
their six - year fraud came to an end in 2010 after @entity8 was arrested and charged with dealing drugs at his off licence in @entity42			1
police began investigating the couple 's finances and during a two year inquiry discovered they were living a life ' well beyond their means			0
' the two houses had been bought as a result of multiple false mortgage applications and @entity9 was also found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her fashion shop whilst the couple were claiming tax credits and other significant benefits			1
she failed to declare the shop to the authorities and even moved a tenant into the flat above - so could illegally pocket housing benefits			0
today @entity8 was starting a three year jail sentence after pleading guilty to 15 offences of mortgage fraud , false accounting , money laundering and fraudulent activity to obtain tax credits			1
@entity9 pleaded guilty to nine offences of mortgage fraud , false accounting , money laundering and acquiring criminal property and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years			1
after the case @entity75 , @entity76 from @entity78 's @entity77 said : ' the @entity79 ' were living a lifestyle and driving around in cars that many honest hard - working people can only dream of			0
@entity84 was found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her shop , @entity87 ' there is no doubt much of this money came from their illegal activities as neither had any discernible legitimate disclosed income that could fund such spending			1
' in addition to this , they were still claiming benefits and taking away money that is there to support those who genuinely need it			0
' @entity9 's cv , which was recovered following her arrest , even went as far to say that she was adept at filling in official forms , such as income support and disability allowance			2
' this couple tried to hide their criminal dishonesty behind a tangled web of 24 bank accounts			2
however , we were able to unpick their finances and discover exactly what money they had been spending			0
' @entity118 @entity117 heard the applications were dishonestly filled out by the couple to obtain mortgages , loans and state benefits between 2003 and 2009			2
@entity124 , prosecuting , said the police investigation into the couple 's finances began in 2010 after @entity8 was jailed for four years for drug dealing from his shop and running a cannabis farm , nearby			1
it emerged @entity8 had claimed to earn just £ 5,000 a year from his shop to obtain £ 77,000 benefits only to then falsely say his annual wage was £ 72,000 to win mortgage loans			1
he was granted a loan of £ 15,000 after giving false references along with his wife and another loan for £ 38,000 to buy the @entity30 before converting that to successfully applying to a building society for a mortgage of £ 174,000			1
he then used that money to buy a property in @entity34 , which was later used to run his cannabis farm			2
the couple told banks to buy property and cars including this £ 200,000 property and a @entity30 his wife successfully applied for a loan for £ 93,500 , giving a dishonest annual income of £ 35,000 then used it to buy another property in @entity34 , from which she set up a fashion outlet			1
yet to the @entity156 she never declared any income made and sold the property , making a profit			0
the couple also jointly applied for a loan to re-mortgage their property - for around £ 76,000			2
they acquired the @entity29 through hire purchase			0
in mitigation defence counsel mr @entity166 , for @entity8 , said : ' he expressed deep remorse and real appreciation that he has committed serious offences and how he intends to turn his life around			1
' ' he met his wife and married her against his family 's wishes which led to him being isolated for a number of years			2
this has led to him seeking to establish his own lifestyle and family			0
' for @entity9 , defence counsel mr @entity178 said her business had not been a success and there were still outstanding arrears			2
she had since been working as a clerk was looking after the children , one of which suffers from a spine disorder			0
he added : ' the situation has caused her severed stress and she has been on medication			0
it 's not just her life hanging in the balance ; it 's also her four children 's			0
they will have to go into care - it would make the damage exceptional			0
' passing sentence judge @entity199 told the couple : ' this was a persistent and sophisticated dishonesty to bolster your income and assets over a period of six years or so			2
' you left no stone unturned			0
you falsely obtained benefits , cheating the public and finance companies by falsely declaring income			0
' ' i 'm told that you 're remorseful - but i have no doubt you are sorry you have been caught and i have no doubt you are sorry for the impact on you and your family			0
' ' but you were cheating the whole public			0
