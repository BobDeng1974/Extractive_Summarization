by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 02:24 est , 5 september 2013 under attack : pilot officer @entity2 was forced to bail out of his @entity3 1 after a tense clash with the @entity5 in the skies above @entity7 , @entity8 , during @entity9 @entity10 never knew her father			1
a war hero who flew @entity13 in the @entity14 , he was tragically killed aged 26 in a dogfight over the @entity16 in november 1940 - four months before she was born			1
it was n't pilot officer @entity2 's first brush with the @entity5			1
a month earlier he had been at the controls of one of the iconic fighters when it was shot from the skies of south - west @entity24 by a @entity27 bomber 's machineguns			1
on that occasion , the @entity29 ace bailed out safely but his stricken aircraft crashed on @entity7			1
in an upbeat letter to his wife and miss @entity10 's mother , @entity34 , he recalled the episode as ' all very exciting ... especially coming down by parachute which really was not at all unpleasant ! ' his words from beyond the grave were among the little miss @entity10 knew of the incident ... until yesterday			2
for the 72 - year - old , a research fellow in geopolitics , was present when wreckage from the @entity3 1 from which her father ejected unharmed was dug up by soldiers wounded in @entity45 and @entity46			1
the physically and mentally - injured troops and veterans excavated the remnants of the plane , buried for 73 years , as part of @entity52 , an award - winning @entity55 project which uses archaeology to aid their recovery			2
during a highly emotional day , miss @entity10 was handed buried artefacts from the stricken , mangled plane , number @entity60 , including part of a propeller , a crumpled fuel gauge , a piece of windscreen and buckles from the parachute release mechanism			1
the trinkets were small but meant the world to the pilot 's daughter			2
she said : ' seeing the @entity3 being excavated meant a great deal to me			2
it is remarkable to touch something that my father would have touched so many years ago			0
brave : pilot @entity10 's @entity78 ( stock image pictured ) crashed on the @entity7 on october 27 , 1940			1
the officer incredibly survived after bailing out of the aircraft but was killed a month later in a clash with the @entity5 over the channel momentous occasion : pilot @entity10 's daughter @entity85 , 72 , pictured , yesterday witnessed her father 's plane being excavated on the @entity7 nearly 73 years after it crash landed award - winning programme : the remains of the @entity3 1 , number @entity91 , are being excavated by soldiers wounded in @entity45 and @entity46 as part of the @entity55 project @entity52 ' it makes me feel closer to my father			1
coming here and seeing the landscape has made what happened to him more realistic			0
' like anyone who lost their father in the war , you are always emotional all your life , you always have a sense of mourning for never knowing them			0
nothing will ever take that away but being here has been a great comfort			0
' pilot officer @entity10 , from @entity113 , was a solicitor before the @entity9 but at the first prospect of conflict he joined the @entity29 volunteer reserve and learned to fly			1
he was posted to fly spitfires with @entity119 - the first unit to record 100 ' kills ' - and was stationed at @entity120			0
on october 27 , 1940 , he and two comrades took off in pursuit of a @entity27 bomber - a @entity124 88 or @entity125 , according to combat logs - which was heading to bombard the docks and armaments factories in the west of @entity24			1
the remains of pilot @entity10 's spitfire plane that has been uncovered			1
soldiers have already pulled part of the landing gear and some bullets from the ground good cause : the @entity55 archaeology project is to help aid wounded soldiers ' rehabilitation guess work : wounded soldiers read a manual on the @entity3 to try and identify parts of the plane they uncovered during the dig crash site : the @entity78 crashed on the @entity7 more than 70 years ago on october 27 , 1940 , after coming under attack by a @entity27 plane as they attacked , a round from the @entity27 plane punctured his oil tank , spewing fuel all over the windscreen and ' reducing visibility to nil '			1
unsure he could land the @entity3 safely , pilot officer @entity10 bailed out and the aircraft crashed close to @entity159 , @entity8			1
in his letter home from his base , the astonishingly matter - of - fact @entity29 officer said : ' i came down quite unharmed close to an aerodrome where i washed off all the oil which simply covered my face and head , had some lunch , chatted with some fellows i knew there and was flown back here this afternoon			2
' a month later , during a dogfight with the @entity5 over the @entity16 , the pilot was shot down and killed			1
he is buried at @entity176 in @entity177			1
more than 70 years later , @entity178 , a senior historic advisor at the @entity180 , which runs the @entity55 's land and properties , received a request from amateur archaeologists to excavate the site			0
lethal : bullets were among the spitfire plane parts to be found during the dig yesterday discoveries : the soldiers uncovered part of a propeller , a crumpled fuel gauge , a piece of windscreen and buckles from the parachute release mechanism as well as several bullets delicate operation : @entity10 , seen second left , watches as a soldier unearths parts of her father 's @entity3 1 mr @entity178 , who founded @entity52 for injured riflemen , refused because the wreckage was buried on @entity55 land			1
but he thought it would be an excellent site for the wounded troops to investigate			0
he assembled a team of around 25 current and ex-members of the rifles to take part in the dig , which began this week			0
in a remarkable twist , they managed to trace pilot officer @entity10 's daughter , who lives near @entity218 , @entity219 , to inform her of the project			1
mr @entity178 said : ' the project has made a poignant and moving discovery			0
archaeology is all about people – whether they be prehistoric , @entity225 , @entity226 or those who flew in the @entity9			0
‘ this site has yielded traces relating to the sacrifices of airmen from the 1940s and it has been a real privilege to re-tell the story of @entity2			2
' we knew from the combat logs kept at the time what happened during this flight but we do n't know the final few moments before the plane crashed			2
' this excavation is the final piece in that story			0
' special moment : @entity10 said getting to see parts of the plane piloted by her father , who died before she was born , has been a great comfort rare opportunity : around 25 former members of @entity251 took part in the dig on @entity55 land going all out : those running @entity52 managed to track down @entity10 to inform her of the project and invite her to visit the excavation site in action : a @entity259 1 similar to that flown by pilot officer @entity261 pictured in the sky the team will now analyse the remnants dug up to try and find out more about exactly how the @entity3 crashed			1
lance corporal @entity265 , 37 , who suffered serious arm injuries in a suicide attack in @entity46 in 2004 , signed up to @entity52 after leaving the 6th @entity268 on medical grounds			0
the primary school teacher from @entity271 , @entity272 , has now completed eight digs			0
he said : ' it was fascinating to excavate @entity276 and @entity277 sites but to dig a @entity3 is magical			2
everyone knows about their importance in the war			0
to be able to do it for @entity85 is extra special			0
' @entity52 was inspired by the novel ' @entity284 ' , which portrays an injured first world war veteran who convalesces by restoring a @entity287 church mural			0
the programme helps with troops ' recovery by boosting their confidence and self - esteem , ensuring they do not fall victim to depression and family breakdown , and giving them new skills for when they return to duty or start a new life outside the military			0
under the guidance of experienced archaeologists , wounded soldiers from the rifles have been taking painstaking care to excavate historic sites			0
happy couple : pilot officer @entity2 and his wife @entity34 in 1939 , just one year before he died family ties : @entity10 never got to meet her father but said getting to see his plane being excavated has given her a new link to him lucky escape : pilot officer @entity2 did n't die in the @entity7 plane crash after he managed to bail out in his parachute in time			1
tragically he was killed a month later they have learned to photograph and map landscapes using state - of - the - art surveying equipment , careful uncover , clean and bag artefacts , and catalogue their invaluable finds			2
last year the injured troops uncovered 26 saxon burials , an earlier prehistoric cremation , three shields , five spears and drinking vessel and other artefacts dating back to the 6th century during a dig at @entity332 on @entity7			2
they have also discovered bone combs , prehistoric pottery , beads and stone tools at a remarkable @entity277 midden , or artificial hill , at @entity339 , @entity8			0
because the sites lie within the restricted @entity342 training area on @entity7 they have been protected from destruction by farms , settlements and roads as well as the attention of other archaeologists			0
the ground - breaking project is supported by @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , 135 @entity354 and @entity355			0
@entity52 has won a @entity356 to recognise its work and has appeared on the @entity359 programme @entity360			0
hard at work : the team of wounded soldiers will analyse the remnants of the @entity3 under the guidance of experienced archaeologists inspiration : @entity52 was inspired by the novel ' @entity369 ' , which portrays an injured first world war veteran who convalesces by restoring a @entity287 church mural education : the project helps the soldiers learn new skills for when they return to duty or for new careers outside the military @entity379 finds : troops uncovered 26 saxon burials , an earlier prehistoric cremation , three shields , five spears and drinking vessel and other artefacts dating back to the 6th century during a dig at @entity332 on @entity7 last year as part of the project a place in history : a poster unveiling the @entity3 from around 1939			1
