i reckon they missed a trick at the 2014 @entity4 awards on @entity5 on sunday evening			1
it was clear for a while that this was not going to be @entity9 's year			1
but i would have still arranged to have him on camera , stood alongside an empty swimming pool , looking rather sad and forlorn			1
something that the lad can really pull off			2
every now and then , we 'd go over to @entity9 , who 'd be stood there silently and alone			2
when suddenly @entity16 would stroll into shot , put one of those big , powerful paws on @entity9 's sagging shoulder and say ' sorry mate , not this year '			2
for a big slapstick finish , @entity16 would then gently push @entity9 in to the pool like a mighty redwood being sent down the river			2
there was a time when playing it for a few laughs was very much part of the @entity32 brief			1
but the hit or miss nature of some of the antics is probably why this approach has now been filed away under ' cheesy '			2
@entity38 receives the trophy as the @entity41 driver is named the 2014 @entity32 @entity9 pictured in @entity42 with the trophy last year after winning the famous award what the event now leans on heavily is the re-selling of the dramatic sporting moment			1
then endeavours to add the human touch through the conversations and speeches			2
so more the @entity53 than it 's a knockout			2
but in the process , has it perhaps become a little earnest , just too overblown for its own good ? you could easily be forgiven for thinking so right from the top as the @entity60 of @entity61 opened proceedings inside @entity64 's monstrous @entity63			1
a stadium band playing a home game			2
this was then underlined as the show 's three hosts @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 made a heralded catwalk entrance onto the epically proportioned , sparkling set			1
i could just imagine @entity76 watching from home and thinking ' even i reckon this is a bit over the top '			2
although he would probably be quietly impressed by @entity72 's rasping @entity81 impression			0
by this point , if you were actually still hankering for a few giggles , then your wish was soon to be fulfilled			0
and probably just as quickly quashed			0
all the eight - year - olds still up after 9:30 would have been thrilled to see one of their @entity90 heroes @entity91 disrupting proceedings from the audience			0
@entity94 band @entity61 kick off the awards ceremony at the @entity63 on sunday night presenters @entity71 ( left ) , @entity72 ( centre ) and @entity70 are pictured on stage but as i say , they are eight ! they 're allowed to find it funny			0
the rest of us , i imagine , just squirmed a little on our settees			0
indeed , fifteen minutes later , as @entity71 introduced the latest contender from alongside the audience , @entity105 still looked so shocked , you feared if the wind changed , his face would stay like that			0
having said all of this , i will hand it to the puppet for one thing			0
it did voice the question that i had been asking myself from the start			0
where was @entity121 ? one thing that has n't gone awol in @entity32 , though , is the top @entity5 film - making talent which is clearly still given full reign to conjure up those marvellous vignettes ( @entity127 's " groundhog day " short being a prime example ) that perfectly remind us of the excellence of the contenders			1
however , then taking these same athletes out of their sporting comfort zones , sticking them in some posh togs and asking them to chit chat casually in front of 12,000 people and a live telly audience is a big ask			1
and quite frankly , i found it often to be just be a little awkward to watch			0
i was uncomfortable for them			0
@entity140 ( centre ) speaks to the crowd in @entity64 after being announced as the winner indeed , i do n't think the sheer scale of the event does the hosts many favours , either			0
these are three of our top sports broadcasters			0
yet it would seem they might have been better off playing summer seasons in @entity154 rather than welcoming us to the fields of play , so as to prepare themselves for the demands of delivering the biz they call show			1
although i 'm not sure anything could have prepared @entity72 for the moment when he was upstaged by an upped kilt ! yet there was one man who did look like he belonged up there under the bright lights			1
as @entity38 made his first appearance of the night , it came with a close up from the audience by @entity174			1
so if he 's good enough for @entity175 ... ? ' how you doing @entity64 ? ' bigged up @entity38 , like he was on the @entity178 leg of his world tour			1
before then trying to sell us all tickets to his girlfriend @entity182 's gigs			0
his personality can appear as slick as the tyres he rips up around @entity41 tracks , but clearly that will to win rubbed off on the viewing audience , who made him their number one choice			0
that 's a viewing audience that was able to see him win his championship live on the @entity5 , of course ! prince @entity175 ( left ) presents the @entity197 to former track cyclist sir @entity198 mind you , he had his work cut out stealing this particular show from a man from the two wheeled game			1
sir @entity198 had a genuine and emotional moment while picking up his @entity205			1
lest we forget , though , @entity16 is a champ			0
and with a hug for his brother , @entity38 was back on the stage , and back on pole			1
this time , however , the visor was up			0
and now we could see an emotional young man , his voice wavering , thanking his family , being ' proud to carry the @entity215 ' and being honoured at ' standing with the greats '			0
so , in those last few minutes , @entity32 delivered what we have come to love about this telly institution			1
however , whether it wants to continue to present itself rather like the popular music singing contest the aforementioned @entity76 was involved in at the same time over on @entity223 , i think is a question well worth asking			0
@entity38 ( centre ) with runner - up @entity226 ( right ) and third - placed @entity228 after the ceremony			1

@entity38 was named the 2014 @entity32
the show leans heavily on the *re-telling* of the dramatic sporting moment
has the show become just too overblown for its own good ?
