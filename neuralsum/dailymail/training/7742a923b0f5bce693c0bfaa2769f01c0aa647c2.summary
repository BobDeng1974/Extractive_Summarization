@entity4 rugby match between local rivals @entity4 and @entity7 was *halted* when a naked streaker came on to the field of play
the streaker , not wanting to disrupt play , *joined* in with the action and even helped make a tackle
the @entity4 team did not take *kindly* to the streaker and proceeded to *punch* and kick him
this caused a mass brawl at the side of the pitch , as @entity7 players defended their streaker
