the chancellor risked the wrath of @entity9 backbenchers who have called for cuts to international development by announcing an extra £ 800million for 2015 - 16			1
but to meet the coalition ’s pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid , money from the @entity17 and @entity18 will count towards the target			1
aid : the coalition has committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid , while cutting elsewhere proud : @entity2 defended the decision to increase foreign aid spending while cutting other @entity27 departments y up to 10 per cent right wingers on the @entity9 backbenchers have repeatedly called for an end to the protection given to overseas aid			1
along with health and schools , it was one of the only areas of spending ring fenced by mr @entity2 in his search for an extra £ 11.5billion of cuts in 2015 - 16			1
in total the @entity4 will spend £ 12.22billion in its @entity41 commitment			0
it means it will spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015 on helping the poor overseas			1
it includes an extra £ 809million in the @entity47 budget			2
around £ 100million in science research for helping poor countries from the @entity50 will also count towards the @entity41 target , along with £ 100million of @entity17 funding for asylum cases			0
spending : only foreign aid , @entity55 and the spy agencies have seen increases in the departmental programme and administration budgets , with most departments suffering cuts of up to 10 per cent infrastructure : billions of pounds in extra building projects have been directed towards transport , justice and business in an attempt to kickstart growth mr @entity2 told @entity69 : ‘ @entity70 also means refusing to balance the budget on the backs of the world ’s poorest			1
‘ i know not everyone believes we should fulfil our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on development			2
‘ but i do – and i ’m proud to support a government that is the first in our history to meet our pledge and meet it not only this year , but next year and the year after			0
‘ of course , overseas development is about more than just the @entity47 budget , and we comply with internationally policed rules			0
‘ but the @entity47 budget is the lion ’s share , and it will be set at £ 11.1 billion in 2015 - 16			0
