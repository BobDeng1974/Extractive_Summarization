on first glance they appear to simply be bland , bleach - white seashells , but when viewed under ultraviolet light they are transformed			1
scientists have used a new technique to reconstrcut the colourful patterns on 28 fossilised cone snail shells that are up to 6.6 million years old			1
the technique has allowed researchers to look millions of years into the past to see how these once elaborately decorated shells would have once looked			2
the fossilised cone snail shells have bleached over time , like the one labelled a , but under ultraviolet light traces of pigment still in the shells are revealed , labelled @entity17 , allowing their colours to be reconstrcuted ( c ) instead of being a simple white colour , they were infact covered in streaks of orange , purple , blue and even large pokadots			1
the scientists now believe the cone snail shells , which come from the northern @entity27 , include 13 entirely new species			1
a deadly tropical sea snail uses a super-potent form of insulin to subdue its fish prey , scientists have discovered			0
the geographic cone snail ( @entity34 ) uses the chemical to cause a plunge in blood sugar , leaving the fish sluggish and unable to swim to safety			2
in this way the snail is able to entrap whole schools of small fish			0
@entity44 is one of the most venomous creatures on @entity46 , and known to have killed dozens of people in accidental encounters			0
it hunts in two ways , both by releasing toxins into the water and by firing a harpoon - like poison - tipped tooth into its @entity56 antidote exists for a cone snail sting , which contains a mixture of nerve agents			2
the new research has uncovered one highly unusual ingredient in the cone snail 's venom cocktail - weaponised insulin			2
in tests , a synthetic version of the hormone - made from shorter protein chains than normal insulin - lowered the blood sugar levels of adult zebrafish			0
injected into water , it also reduced the movements of fish larvae			0
there are about 30 recorded instances of people being killed by cone snails , some of which have attractive and collectible shells			0
dr @entity82 , a paleontologist at the @entity83 who led the research , said that the lack of colouration in many fosisilised cone snail shells made them difficult to identify			1
he said : ' original coloration patterns — if not the actual colors themselves — sometimes become visible when fossil shells are illuminated with ultraviolet light , which causes formerly pigmented regions of the shell to fluoresce			1
' once a specimen has been photographed under uv light , it is possible to use photoediting software to reconstruct the original shell coloration pattern			0
' this is done by creating a reversed , negative image , which causes bright , fluorescing markings to become darkened , corresponding with regions that were once pigmented			0
' dr @entity82 used the ultraviolet technique to examine a range of fossilised shells that were discovered in the @entity109 of the northern @entity27			1
although it is now a rich and fertile inland valley , millions of years ago during the @entity112 it was covered by ocean			0
all cone snails are venomous and predatory , with many species still around today			0
they use a harpoon like tooth that injects venom into their prey			0
in some cases the cone snail toxins are lethal to humans while many have a painful sting			2
due to their bright colours and patterns they are often handled by unwary humans , leaving them vulnerable to stings			0
there are around 700 species of cone snail still living in tropical seas worldwide and around 1,000 species have been found in the fossil record			1
this image shows three of the fossil shells studied by the scientists as they currently appear without colour scientists used @entity145 light to reveal tiny traces of the pigment left in the shell and the patterns they once had however , identifying these can often be tricky as over time the bright pigments in the shells fade			1
exposing them to ultraviolet light causes any remaining organic matter in the shells - like pigment - to fluoresce			1
it is thought that these compounds in the shells oxidise over time and so light up when uv light is shined on them			0
dr @entity82 , whose work is published in the journal @entity167 , compared the cone snail shells he examined with the patterns of those of modern @entity172 cone snails			1
he found that many of the fossils showed similar patterns , indicating that some modern species belong to lineages that have survived in the @entity172 for millions of years			2
uv light allowed scientists to peer back millions of years to reconstruct shell patterns and colours as above dr @entity82 said : ' this approach — combined with the exceptional @entity112 fossil record of the @entity27 , as well as other regional fossil deposits — has the potential to provide a detailed understanding of the evolutionary and biogeographic development of the modern western @entity189 cone snail fauna			1
' clearly much more work needs to be done to better understand the compounds responsible for shell coloration			0
' that said , it seems that oxidation - caused either naturally by exposure of shells to sunlight over prolonged periods of time , or artificially by soaking in bleach for several days - plays a role in causing formerly pigmented regions of fossil shells to fluoresce under uv light , though the reason is not currently understood			2
' @entity44 ( above ) is one of 700 existing cone snail species and is one of most venomous living animals			1

fossilised cone snail shells found in @entity109 of @entity27
in visible light they appear to be a plain white colour as the pigments faded
under ultraviolet light , however , the vivid patterns and colours fluoresce
scientists were able to reconstruct how the *ancient* species once looked
