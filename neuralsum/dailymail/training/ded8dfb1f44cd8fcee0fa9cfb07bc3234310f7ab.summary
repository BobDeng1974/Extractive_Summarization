by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 17 october 2012 a @entity2 farmer was faced with the extraordinary sight of his carrots standing upright above the ground after a nearby river burst its banks and washed away the soil around them			1
@entity10 , 60 , went out to check his fields at @entity12 in @entity13 after the @entity14 burst its banks , and was worried that his crops might have been badly damaged or washed away			1
but he found the vegetables were upright after the soil around them was washed away – only days after the harvester had gone through the field making paths in preparation for the harvest			2
remarkable : @entity10 was ' amazed ' when he saw that his carrots were standing upright after water from a burst river bank had washed away much of the soil once the river burst its banks it flowed through the fields on its way to the sea , but fortunately followed the path made by the harvester , saving nearly all the carrots			1
the only carrots that were washed away were found further down the field , suspended in trees at the bottom of the site			0
mr @entity10 said today : ‘ we had about three inches of rain and the @entity14 burst its banks about half a mile from here			1
it came right down through the crop of carrots			0
' the water just washed away all the soil and left the carrots standing			1

‘ we did n’t think we would be able to harvest them as they would just fall over , but we have			0
' saved : once the river burst its banks it flowed through the fields on its way to the sea , but fortunately followed the path made by the harvester , saving nearly all the carrots he added : ‘ it ’s lucky the river followed the paths - it would have been a very different story if it had washed through the field			1

we are very relieved ' @entity10 , farmer ‘ i suppose it ’s quite a novel way to wash carrots in the field , though i would n’t want it to happen again			2
‘ a few of the carrots were washed away into the trees at the bottom of the field , they were about five foot off the ground , just left dangling there			0
i have never seen anything like this before			0
’ mr @entity10 set up the farm in 1988 with his wife @entity87 they now employ 50 people at the site and supply neeps and carrots to markets across the @entity93 and @entity94 .			2
