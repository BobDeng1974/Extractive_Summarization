yet the thousands of veterans who sailed on @entity11 convoys to support the @entity13 war effort have been told they can not collect bravery medals			1
some 3,000 servicemen have been offered @entity17 medals by the @entity13 government to recognise their courage in taking part in @entity11 missions to support fighting on the eastern front during the @entity24			1
harrowing conditions : thousands of sailors risked their lives in @entity11 conditions to support the @entity13 war effort during the second world war appalling cold : @entity29 and ice covered the upper works of all ships			1
some 3,000 servicemen were awarded bravery medals for taking part in the daring campaign but they have been told by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) that accepting the medals would break rules in this country			1
among those who were involved in the daring campaign was lieutenant commander @entity42 , 90 , from @entity43 , @entity44 , who served on the cruiser @entity47 when it travelled to @entity48 in 1942 as the flagship for the convoys			2
on the return journey the cruiser , carrying four tonnes of gold bullion as payment from @entity54 , was attacked over successive days by waves of enemy aircraft , submarines and destroyers			2
the ship was hit by two torpedoes and , despite fighting on for three days , was eventually sunk by a third			2
crippled : @entity47 was sunk carrying four tonnes of gold bullion			0
it was attacked over successive days by waves of enemy aircraft , submarines and destroyers courageous : lieutenant commander @entity42 was on board @entity47 when it was attacked			0
he was told he could not accept the @entity13 offer because he had already been honoured with the @entity72 damaged : pictured is @entity47 after a torpedo hit it			1
two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships the ship ( stern pictured ) fought on for three days after it was hit by two torpedoes before it was eventually sunk by a third two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships			0
lt @entity85 said : ‘ @entity11 convoys were renowned to be the toughest voyages			1
in addition to the threats from u-boats , bombers and surface craft to all convoys , the main enemy was the bitter cold			0
‘ i 've known of ships where the build - up of ice led to the whole thing capsizing and the ship disappearing with all hands			0
pictured is the @entity13 medal of @entity17 , awarded for bravery ‘ we had to keep chipping away at the ice , were constantly wet and it was normally too cold to sleep when off watch			1
’ the @entity37 told veterans that because they have already been honoured with the @entity72 campaign medal , they could not accept the @entity13 offer			1
they were also told that their service had to have taken place in the last five years for them to be eligible			1
it has recently announced the creation of a specific @entity11 campaign medal to recognise the severe hardships of this part of naval history			1
lt @entity85 said : ‘ i 'm pleased to see that this government has finally agreed to give us a @entity124 campaign medal			0
‘ i 'm told that checking eligibility for the award may take months , though , so i 'm hoping i 'll still be around when all of the bureaucracy has been carried out			0
none of us are getting any younger			0
‘ i think they have got it wrong , though			0
the @entity13 government wants to give us a bravery medal , not a campaign medal			2
there is a big difference			0
‘ why ca n't our @entity139 bend the rules when the @entity145 , @entity144 , @entity142 and @entity143 governments have all allowed their veterans to accept this great honour ? ‘ i think the government should do what is right by the thousands of us who endured for freedom all those years ago , many of whom never made it			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity37 said the department appreciated the @entity13 government 's wish to recognise the ‘ brave and valuable ’ service given by veterans of the @entity11 convoys			1
he said : ‘ the rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted , there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years			2
unsung : one of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war hero : in perilous conditions a sailor frees chains , wires and bollards from the ice ‘ additionally , permission can not be granted if they have received , or are expected to receive , a @entity124 award for the same services			0
‘ we look at each request for permission to confer a foreign or @entity192 state award upon a @entity124 citizen on an individual case - by - case basis			0
’ a lapel badge - the @entity196 - was introduced in 2006 and some 10,000 have been issued			0
