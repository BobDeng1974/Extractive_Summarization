by @entity0 published : 14:54 est , 28 july 2012 updated : 06:47 est , 29 july 2012 last night , an audience of four billion people witnessed the lighting of the @entity5 flame at the climax of a dazzling @entity7 , marking the start of the 30th @entity9 in @entity10			1
athletes from all corners of the globe were cheered by a 60,000 - strong crowd in a rapturous reception which will never be erased from their memories			2
while the majority of @entity21 's 541 athletes were present to enjoy the show , there were some who sadly could n't be there			1
@entity26 sailing gold medallist @entity25 lights the @entity5 flame in a mini version of the @entity7 held in @entity29 and @entity30 today but @entity31 did n't stand on ceremony for long , taking part in the final @entity35 practice race in @entity36			1
the white chalk horse of @entity38 can be seen in the background the @entity21 sailing team for the @entity5			1
@entity41 are the most successful nation in the history of @entity5 sailing and their performance director has predicted that @entity21 should medal in all ten events @entity35 - @entity25 @entity49 - @entity48 and @entity50 @entity51 - @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 laser - @entity55 470 women - @entity57 and @entity58 470 men - @entity60 and @entity61 @entity62 - @entity63 49er - @entity64 and @entity65 @entity66 : @entity67 - @entity68 @entity66 : x women - @entity70 but not wanting to miss out on the magical moment the flame is lit , our sailors held their own mini opening ceremony on the waterfront in @entity29 today			1
in the real thing , the honour of igniting the cauldron was given to @entity21 's athletes of tomorrow , but it was a superstar of the past and present who did the honours here			1
@entity25 will begin his pursuit of an unprecedented fourth straight @entity86 and fifth medal overall tomorrow when he steers his @entity35 onto @entity36			1
success at the quaint seaside resort favoured by @entity90 this week will make the 35 - year - old the most successful sailor in @entity5 history			2
but while most attention will be lavished on @entity31 , @entity21 boasts a whole roster of potential medal winners in an event that is traditionally among their strongest			0
the whole squad lined up to welcome the @entity5 flame under gorgeous blue skies in @entity29 , before taking to the waves to run through final practice sessions before the races begin			1
the seaside resort of @entity29 will offer a beautiful backdrop to the @entity5 sailing events			1
here , sunbathers on the sandy beaches watch @entity25 in action in his final practice race @entity54 , @entity53 , and @entity52 of @entity21 make sure everything is perfect before the @entity51 class races begin @entity115 6m crew @entity114 , @entity116 and @entity117 ride the waves of @entity29 @entity41 sailing leader @entity119 believes no other country can match @entity21 's strength in depth and said there is every chance we will see medallists in all ten classes			1
when rating @entity31 's chances , @entity128 does n't mince his words : ' i think that everybody expects @entity25 will win a gold medal			2
' if he sails his normal game , there is no reason why he should n't			0
he dominated the recent world championships and i think the rest of the fleet are racing for second			0
' star crew @entity141 and @entity143 , from @entity144 , encounter some choppy waters in their final practice close combat as the @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 crews in the star class jostle for position the @entity155 weather was kind on the @entity150 @entity49 crew of @entity156 and @entity157			0
the crystal clear blue skies of saturday in @entity29 are unlikely to last all week , however @entity31 just wants to get on with the proper business of racing after the long @entity5 build - up			0
he said after practice today : ' i am ready to go			0
i am looking forward to racing and hope things go well			0
' it was good out there today			0
it was a great breeze , perfect sailing conditions			2
' it is an interesting course that medal race course			0
it is pretty tricky so tomorrow starting off will be a tough race			2
' it is cramped out there			0
i think you 've just got to be more prepared for the difficult conditions and know it wo n't be perfect			0
you 've just got to deal with it and prepare for a bit of a scrap			0
' tomorrow 's two races in the @entity35 will see @entity31 tackle the @entity185 , which is the medal race course , and then the @entity188 course			1
