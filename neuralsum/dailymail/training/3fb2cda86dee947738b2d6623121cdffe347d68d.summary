who knew fatalities could be so fun ? funny guy @entity2 of @entity3 decided to make a video where he surprised unsuspecting people trapped in an elevator with him while dressed as a character from the fantasy martial arts video game , and film , @entity13			1
the results , filmed somewhere in the @entity15 , were both terrifying and hysterical			0
there was also a man who was incensed at @entity2 's yelling and wild hand motions and another who laughed hysterically throughout the entire thing			0
as guests enter the elevator , the theme music would begin to play and the second the doors shut , @entity2 , dressed as the character @entity51 , the thunder god , would spring into action			2
he would then quickly calm down the people , though one couple that ran for their lives after seeing him as he fake choked a friend may be scarred for life			0
laugh factor : this woman found the entire experience hysterical , and was at no point scared tough break : this group of guys got ready to beat on @entity2 after the saw him ( fake ) fighting one of their friends playtime : these kids were both frightened and amused erakat himself almost got scarred for life too , when one group of boys pinned him to the ground and got ready to beat him after they say him kicking another man , but the comic was able to reveal the prank in time			1
but hey , at least he got a taste of his own medicine			0
this is the second @entity13 video the 24 - year - old has made , and just one of the many prank hidden camera stunts he has released since 2010 .			1

@entity2 of @entity3 made a hidden camera video in which he pretends to be @entity91 from @entity13
he would start to attack people while the @entity13 music played in an elevator
while at first terrified , many found it very funny , except for one group of men who almost beat up @entity2
