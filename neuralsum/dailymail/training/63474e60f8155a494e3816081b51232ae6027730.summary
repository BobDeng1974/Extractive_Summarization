international experts have conceded they missed early chances to control the spread of @entity3 as they incorrectly believed an initial lull in deaths meant the outbreak was over			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) concluded that ' modest further intervention efforts ' could have controlled the outbreak in the spring			1
they conceded that infighting and finger pointing led to delays in the international response , according to a @entity15 investigation			1
allowing the less experienced @entity17 branch of the @entity7 to co-ordinate efforts on the ground and failing to understand how @entity17 attitudes towards issues such as burial might affect the disease 's spread also allowed the outbreak to escalate			1
' modest further intervention efforts ' could have controlled the outbreak in the spring , @entity7 ( @entity7 ) experts said			1

' people should n't die because someone 's embarrassed that they ca n't do it themselves , ' he said experts incorrectly believed the outbreak was ' over ' in april as cases of the disease had slowed			2
in fact , it had gone underground and would go on to kill 7,800 people by december 2014			0
pictured are health workers carrying the body of a suspected @entity3 victim for burial at a cemetery in @entity55 , @entity56 dr @entity60 , an @entity3 specialist at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , @entity57 , who spent nearly two months in @entity58 during the early days of the outbreak , said the lack of new cases prompted aid organisations to withdraw and declare the outbreak over			1
' this is close to over , ' the @entity15 reported he said to himself on the plane ride home in april			2
' that 's it for this outbreak			2
' in fact , 20,000 people would go on to contract @entity3 and 7,800 have now died			2
dr @entity60 said health officials underestimated how much @entity17 practices , especially regarding burial practices , would catalyse the spread of the disease			1
' it was an unprecedented outbreak , ' he said			0
' there were a lot of things we did n't know at that time			0
' the first patient died of @entity3 in @entity58 on december 28 last year , but the virus was not officially recognised until three months later			2
the @entity7 and the @entity58 health ministry documented cases of a handful of people dying or being sick with @entity3 - like symptoms in @entity56 in march , but the information did n't reach the team investigating suspected cases			1
the most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of @entity3 in @entity17 was a young boy playing near a colony of virus - infected bats , scientists claim			1
the two - year - old boy - described as the index case , or patient zero - became infected and was the first to die in his village in @entity103 , guinea in december last year			0
it is thought ' patient zero ' was was @entity107 , described as a playful toddler by his father @entity109			0
before his death , on december 6 , 2013 , @entity107 had been near a tree harbouring the free - tailed bats			0
researchers from the @entity114 in @entity115 concluded the large colony of free - tailed insectivorous bats were the most likely source of the disease			0
villagers reported that children often used to play in and around thehollow tree , and may have resulted in a massive exposure to the bats			0
the toddler came down with a sky - high fever , began vomiting and passing black stools			0
it took four days for the disease to claim @entity107 's life , and he passed away on december 6 , 2013			0
his sister @entity132 fell ill on christmas day last year , and was dead before @entity133			0
their mother followed , along with their grandmother , @entity109 said earlier this year			0
the disease then spread to other members of the community before spreading to other parts of @entity58			0
it was not until may that @entity56 recorded its first confirmed cases , prompting infighting and finger pointing among the @entity7 , @entity58 and @entity56			2
@entity36 , director of the @entity37 , said efforts to help were resisted because @entity17 experts wanted to prove they could tackle the disease on their own			2
usually in such situations the @entity37 would be brought into outbreaks quickly and given a primary role , and dr @entity36 was surprised this had n't happened			0
he learned that @entity37 experts were being held up by bureaucratic demands , and were having their credentials checked by the @entity17 @entity7 officials			1
' people should n't die because someone 's embarrassed that they ca n't do it themselves , ' he said			0
aid and experts were sent from the @entity164 branch of the @entity7 , but leadership of the early response was largely delegated to regional @entity7 representatives on the ground			1
worried , dr @entity169 , who until february sat on the @entity7 executive board , said the @entity17 office was seen as a place where ' politics trumps substance ' and where senior officials are ' often not the cream of the crop '			1
a @entity58 @entity7 official who had never been involved in fighting @entity3 was put in charge of co-ordinating the response on the ground , ahead of dr @entity182 , the @entity7 's top @entity3 authority			1
dr @entity182 said this was obviously ' only because i was coming from @entity164 '			0
the @entity7 's budget for epidemic preparedness and response in @entity17 had also been more than halved over five years from $ 26 million ( £ 17 million ) in 2010 - 11 to $ 11 million ( £ 7 million ) for 2014 - 15 , meaning its capacity had shrunk			1
by april , when officials were hailing the end of the outbreak , it had simply gone ' underground ' , with cases going unreported			2
governments attempted to broadcast the message that @entity3 was spread through contact with fluids like vomit , faeces and blood , and that bodies were still highly contagious after death			2
but communities continued to wash bodies after a burial , as this was believed to lead to contentment in the afterlife			0
villagers complained their relatives taken by health workers to treatment centres never returned and protests outside one @entity217 ( @entity217 ) clinic forced its closure			0
it was n't until august – nine months after the first case recoded in @entity58 – that the @entity7 declared @entity3 was a ' public health emergency of international concern ' – a rating which mobilised an international response			1
writing in the @entity225 , @entity226 , who helped discover @entity3 , and @entity228 , director of the @entity229 concluded the outbreak ' an avoidable crisis '			1

experts concede they missed early chances to control the spread of @entity3
an initial lull led many to believe the outbreak was ' over ' in april
infighting between @entity7 branches delayed response
*ignorance* about @entity17 burial practices allowed virus to spread
officials have concluded the outbreak was ' an avoidable crisis '
