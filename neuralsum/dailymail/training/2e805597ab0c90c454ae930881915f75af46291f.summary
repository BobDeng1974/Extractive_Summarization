published : 05:24 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 05:48 est , 24 october 2012 cows can not contract @entity1 but their immune systems develop antibodies against the foreign protein love it or hate it , cow 's milk is an excellent source of calcium and vitamin @entity12 now scientists think they can harness it to protect people from @entity1			1
researchers found that cows could be used to produce antibodies that defend against the human immunodeficiency virus ( @entity1 )			1
the animals ca n't contract the disease themselves			1
the next step will be to develop it into a cream which women can apply to protect themselves from contracting @entity1 from sexual partners			2
a team from @entity27 worked with @entity29 biotechnology company @entity28 to develop the milk			0
the scientists , led by dr @entity32 , vaccinated pregnant cows with an @entity1 protein and studied the first milk that cows produced after giving birth			1
the first milk , called the colostrum , is naturally packed with antibodies to protect the newborn calf from infections			0
the vaccinated cows produced @entity1 antibodies in their milk			1
' we were able to harvest antibodies specific to the @entity1 surface protein from the milk , ' said dr @entity32			1
' we have tested these antibodies and found in our laboratory experiments that they bind to @entity1 and that this inhibits the virus from infecting and entering human cells			2
' the @entity1 - inhibiting antibodies from cows â€™ milk will be developed into a cream called a microbicide that is applied into the vagina before and / or after sex to protect women from contracting sexually transmitted infections			1
other microbicides are being developed around the world but the antibodies in this research are easier and cheaper to produce , providing a new hiv - prevention strategy			0
' we hope that our anti-hiv milk antibodies will provide a user - friendly , female - controlled , safe and effective tool for the prevention of sexually acquired @entity1 infection , ' dr @entity32 said			2
' if proven effective in humans , it will empower women to protect themselves against @entity1			0
' @entity32 , left , at the @entity27 with frozen milk containing @entity1 antibodies			2
pictured with colleagues @entity80 , middle , and @entity82 about 30 million people are living with @entity1 globally and there is presently no effective vaccine for @entity87 research was supported by the @entity88 for @entity1 and @entity89 and the @entity90			0
dr @entity32 and her colleagues are now developing plans for animal and human studies			0
the work was being sponsored by @entity95 , a national program sponsored by the @entity97			0
it is published in the journal @entity100 .			0

cows ca n't catch @entity1 but they can produce antibodies against the virus
scientists *injected* cows with @entity1 protein , and *collected* *resulting* antibodies from the milk
they plan to create a cream for women to prevent @entity1 transmission
