prototype : scientists have developed a ' smart bra ' which can measure the wearer ¿ s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss they are already used to lift , boost and enhance – but it seems bras could soon be doing something else for women ’s figures			1
scientists have developed a ‘ smart bra ’ which can measure the wearer ’s mood to help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss			1
not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food , but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse			1
@entity22 , a professor in computer science and human performance design from the @entity25 , has helped to design the bra which is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity			1
the data from the prototype device is analysed by a smartphone app which can highlight when ‘ emotional eating ’ is most likely to occur and offer advice to the wearer			2
the app then provides suggestions , such as carrying out calming breathing exercises , to reduce the user ’s stress levels			0
professor @entity22 said : ‘ emotional states , habitual practices , like snacking in front of the tv or grabbing a cookie when stressed , often go undetected by us – that ’s the nature of habits – but they have real effects on our wellbeing			0
‘ our work in this project , while early , shows that there is potential to design interactive technologies to work with us , to help us develop both awareness of our state , and offer options we ’ve decided we ’d rather take , to build new practices and support our wellbeing			0
’ the bra is a result of a study called @entity62 : just - in - @entity63 , written by researchers from the @entity25 , @entity65 and the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			2
the study set out to develop an intervention which is triggered before someone reaches for food as a means of emotional support			2
it suggested the smart bra and matching apps as possible solutions			0
