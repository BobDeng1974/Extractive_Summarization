ten years ago @entity0 , led by an enigmatic young coach by the name of @entity3 , shocked the footballing world by winning the @entity5			2
but that same summer the team was dismantled			0
@entity3 jumped ship to join @entity8 , taking @entity9 and @entity10 with him for a combined fee of more than £ 30million , while the team ’s playmaker @entity12 was lured to the @entity14 by @entity15			1
on monday , @entity16 finally completed the signing of @entity18 , for a fee of £ 32m , which took @entity0 ’s income from transfer fees since they conquered @entity23 sailing through the £ 600m mark			1
and of the £ 614m transferred into @entity0 ’s coffers , £ 145.8m of has come from @entity40 clubs			1
@entity8 got the ball rolling when they signed @entity9 and @entity10 , before going back to @entity42 to take @entity43 off the 27 - time league champions ’ hands			1
the three @entity47 defenders cost @entity0 £ 2.5m in total , with @entity9 a product of their youth system			1
@entity8 spent 25 times that to take them to @entity54			0
@entity55 dabbled , unsuccessfully it has turned out , in @entity0 merchandise when they bought @entity57 ( a £ 4.4m signing from @entity59 side @entity58 ) for £ 27.2m			2
@entity60 splashed out £ 11.4m on midfielder @entity61			0
and this summer it has been @entity16 ’s turn – the @entity32 champions showing patience to add @entity65 and @entity18 to their squad after courting the pair for more than six months			0
@entity0 ’s expenditure during 2004 - 2014 stands at £ 293m , less than half the amount they have pulled in through player sales			2
in only one of the past 10 seasons have the club spent more than they have recouped in transfer fees , when they splashed out £ 35.2m in 2010 - 11 , with @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 among those to join – three players that later left for a total of £ 75.2m			1
cultured : midfielder @entity75 signed for @entity81 alongside @entity76 two years ago moving on to better things : @entity76 has just been sold to @entity83 from @entity81 after a good @entity84 2004 : @entity10 to @entity8 – £ 17.6m 2004 : @entity9 to @entity8 – £ 26.4m 2007 : @entity57 to @entity55 – £ 27.2m 2008 : @entity43 to @entity8 – £ 18m 2010 : @entity61 to @entity60 – £ 11.4m 2014 : @entity65 to @entity16 - £ 13.2m 2014 : @entity18 to @entity16 - £ 44m ( we are saying £ 32m ) their track - record for buying players at low prices from lesser - known clubs and selling them on at a huge profit is remarkable			1
bought for just under £ 6m from @entity93 in 2011 , sold for five times that three years later			0
@entity76 cost them £ 6.5m the previous year and fetched £ 40m when they sold him on to @entity81 last summer			2
the @entity100 striker signed for around £ 5m from @entity101 in 2009 , scored 72 goals in 87 games in all competitions , including 17 ( seventeen ) during their successful @entity106 campaign in 2010 - 11			0
this prompted @entity108 to break their club transfer record and shell out £ 41.4m on the striker			0
other huge money - makers include @entity111 , bought for £ 1.7m from @entity112 and sold to @entity83 for £ 26.4m , and @entity113 , who joined for £ 2m from @entity115 side racing in 2005 and moved to @entity116 for £ 21.1m four years later			0
their scouting work in @entity119 particularly stands out ; @entity98 , @entity76 , @entity113 , @entity57 , @entity77 – all bought for a pittance and sold on for eye - catching fees			2
and that profitable passage shows no sign of drying up , with @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 likely to be the next set of @entity0 players to move to pastures new for massive amounts for massive amounts			0
destined for stardom : @entity57 left @entity0 for @entity55 in 2007 for £ 27m - it has n't quite worked out if you 've got the money : @entity61 ( right ) , here battling @entity57 , joined @entity60 2004 : @entity10 to @entity8 – £ 17.6m 2004 : @entity12 to @entity27 – £ 18.5m 2004 : @entity9 to @entity8 – £ 26.4m 2007 : @entity57 to @entity55 – £ 27.2m 2007 : @entity111 to @entity83 – £ 26.4m 2008 : @entity43 to @entity8 – £ 18m 2008 : @entity135 to @entity136 – £ 21.7m 2009 : @entity137 to @entity138 – £ 16.8m 2009 : @entity113 to @entity116 – £ 21.1m 2010 : @entity139 to @entity140 – £ 19.4m 2011 : @entity98 to @entity108 – £ 41.4m 2012 : hulk to @entity140 – £ 48.4m 2013 : @entity75 to @entity81 – £ 22m 2013 : @entity76 to @entity81 – £ 40m 2014 : @entity18 to @entity16 - £ 32m			1

received £ 614m in transfer fees in last decade , including the sale of @entity12
spent less than half that during the same period
sold 15 players for more than £ 15m as @entity76 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity61 all left
@entity40 clubs have spent £ 145.8m on @entity0 talent in that time
