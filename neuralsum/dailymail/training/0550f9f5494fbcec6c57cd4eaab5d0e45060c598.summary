plans are being drawn up to curb @entity2 mps ’ voting rights , amid @entity5 anger at the sweeteners offered to persuade voters north of the border to reject independence			1
government sources say @entity11 and @entity12 are ‘ very aware ’ of backbench fury over the hastily pulled together ‘ devo max ’ proposals			1
but any move to restrict @entity1 ’ voting rights will be opposed by many senior @entity19 figures , who will try to push back a deal until after the next election			0
@entity23 @entity1 last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to @entity2 unless the huge ‘ subsidy ’ paid by @entity5 taxpayers via the so - called @entity29 formula is also ended : @entity30 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) ahead of the referendum even if he loses the referendum @entity30 ( above ) will be given yet more powers @entity23 @entity1 last night warned they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to @entity2 unless the huge ‘ subsidy ’ paid by @entity5 taxpayers via the so - called @entity29 formula is also ended			1
deputy prime minister @entity12 said yesterday that it was ‘ simply not fair ’ to hand sweeping new powers to @entity2 without also limiting the right of @entity2 mps to vote on @entity5 matters at @entity40			1
the @entity42 leader was confronted on the issue by a series of angry @entity5 callers on his phone - in show on @entity47			0
they questioned why @entity5 should continue to subsidise @entity2 policies such as free care for the elderly , free university tuition and free prescriptions , which are not available south of the border			2
the prime minister has avoided discussing the issue in recent weeks , for fear of handing a propaganda victory to the @entity59			0
but senior @entity60 last night indicated that mr @entity11 will move swiftly to announce plans for ‘ @entity5 votes for @entity5 laws ’ in the event of a no vote			2
proposals drawn up for the party in opposition by former chancellor @entity71 can be ‘ taken of the shelf ’ , and are likely to be unveiled formally in january alongside devolution plans for @entity2 , they said			2
‘ it ’s something the party has long had a position on and it is obvious that something now needs to be done , ’ said one senior conservative			0
but @entity19 fears the move could prevent the passing of legislation on key issues such as health and education			0
if cross-party pledges to devolve major tax powers are put in place , @entity2 ’s 59 mps could even be prevented from voting on parts of the @entity88			0
former prime minister @entity89 – who is leading @entity19 ’s efforts in @entity2 – ruled out reducing the rights of @entity2 mps as part of any post-referendum constitutional deal , saying : ‘ i do n’t think you can have two classes of mps at @entity40			1
’ @entity89 – who is leading @entity19 ’s efforts in @entity2 – ruled out reducing the rights of @entity2 mps as part of any post-referendum constitutional deal but @entity23 @entity1 said it would be ‘ untenable ’ to allow @entity2 mps to continue to enact laws in @entity5 that do not affect their own constituents			1
and several indicated they would vote against any package that retained the @entity29 formula – which means public spending per head is £ 1,623 a year higher in @entity2 than in @entity5			2
mp @entity108 said : ‘ i for one would be very concerned at the idea that my electorate would continue to subsidise the @entity2 even after they have been given all these powers to raise even more money			0
