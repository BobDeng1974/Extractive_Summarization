beleaguered @entity1 anchor @entity0 could have exaggerated another near - death story involving himself - this time from a stint covering @entity5 's 2006 war with @entity6			1
@entity0 seemingly embellished an account of a helicopter ride with @entity10 officials to imply he was almost hit by a rocket , when in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire			1
the potentially pumped - up claims came a little more than a year after the event , when @entity0 recounted a slew of now - doubtful anecdotes about his time in the midst of mortal danger			1
@entity0 told a student reporter he was ' lucky to survive ' the helicopter ride , organized by the @entity5 military to give his @entity1 news crew an aerial perspective of the conflict , near the city of @entity29			1
in a recorded interview ahead of a speaking engagement at @entity49 , @entity50 , he told how rockets whizzed by ' just underneath ' the @entity52 he was riding in with an @entity5 general			2
however , a broadcast segment he himself filmed that day makes no mention of being inches from death , only mentioning plumes of smoke and a rocket he saw fired six miles away			0
if you squint : this footage , shot from the chopper , shows distant rocket fire over @entity5			2
@entity0 's past reports are under intense scrutiny since he admitted embellishing an anecdote from his time in @entity70 in a @entity72 video , he told a report for the student - run @entity75 channel : ' i have been very lucky to survive a few things			1
i tend to forget the war with @entity6 in @entity5 a few years back			0
' there were katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in			2
' however , the fleeting reference does not tally with his own @entity1 report , dated july 18 , 2006			2
there he states that the chopper was 1,500ft in the air , and that the four - star general on board with him mentioned that there was ground - based activity directly below them			0
he continued : ' then , i noticed something out the window			0
from a distance of six miles , i witnessed a rocket launch			0
' a rising trail of smoke , then a second rocket launch , an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward @entity5			0
' he does not suggest that the rocket came anywhere near him			0
the seemingly conflicting accounts , uncovered by the @entity110 , emerged after @entity0 backed out of anchoring @entity1 's flagship @entity112 show			1
it came after it was claimed that @entity1 executives were tipped off about @entity0 's behavior , but did not know how to rein him in			1
on the scene : @entity0 is pictured above posing with a soldier in @entity70			1
veterans of that war called him out on his overblown anecdotes @entity123 columnist @entity122 wrote that news bosses were told last year his claims sometimes did not stack up , and that his tendency to exaggerate had become ' a joke ' among @entity1 staffers			1
over the weekend @entity0 backed off from the anchor 's chair for an unspecified length of time after a firestorm over another helicopter anecdote he had been repeating for years - this time in @entity70			1
@entity0 issued an on - air apology after saying he was on board a helicopter which was downed after being hit by a rocket - propelled grenade , when he was in fact on a different one			1
some days later , after intense criticism of that anecdote and others , he withdrew from presenting the news			0
he said : ' in the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news , it has become painfully apparent to me that i am presently too much a part of the news , due to my actions			0
' as managing editor of @entity112 , i have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days ... ' upon my return , i will continue my career - long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us			0
' in the @entity49 interview , @entity0 also grabs the opportunity to give his @entity70 anecdote an outing			1
currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in @entity70 , a number of @entity0 ' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny @entity170 , @entity171 , 1970s in a 2011 interview @entity0 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			1
however in a 2005 @entity178 interview , @entity0 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			2
in the same @entity178 interview @entity0 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity184 trees in the sleepy @entity171 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘ stuck a .38 - caliber in my face			0
’ @entity192 , 2003 over the years @entity0 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook during the @entity192 in 2003			1
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			2
@entity0 issued an on air apology			0
‘ nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor , ’ he wrote on @entity202			0
@entity206 , 2005 @entity0 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity209			2
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity213 – even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity206 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the floodwaters and that his hotel was ‘ overrun ’ with gangs , have been called into question by others who were there			0
@entity5 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity226 , @entity0 recalled ‘ katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in			1
’ in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away			0
@entity235 , 2006 a navy vet has accused @entity0 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the armed forces so that he could appear on @entity240			2
on the day of the @entity244 event the @entity242 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity240 's @entity249			2
backed off : @entity0 , seen above in his broadcast from friday , has backed off from the anchor 's chair since criticism mounted he said : ' a few years before that you go back to @entity70 and i looked down the tube of an rpg that had been fired at us and it hit the chopper in front of ours			1
' and i 'm so fortunate to be sitting here			0
' though this version of the story does not place @entity0 inside the under - fire vehicle , it does imply that he was right next to the action			1
veterans who were riding in the chopper , which managed to land after the rpg round did not explode , have since said @entity0 's helicopter was not following them , and was nothing to do with their mission			1
in fact , they said , he was around half an hour behind , and only found out about the brush with death after he had landed .			0

under - fire @entity1 anchor seemingly embellished war story from 2006
told student reporter rockets were ' just underneath ' helicopter he was in
his own @entity1 reports from the time do not mention *imminent* danger
came in the same *breath* as his *controversial* tale from @entity70 war
@entity0 has claimed he was inside a chopper hit by rpg fire
was later corrected by veterans who were on the helicopter
@entity1 executives were reportedly warned about exaggerations a year *ago*
