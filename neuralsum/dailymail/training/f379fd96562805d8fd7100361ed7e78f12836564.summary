misting machines were introduced on the fresh produce counters at @entity2 to create an impression of freshness			1
everything from lettuces to loose tomatoes were constantly sprayed with fine droplets of water , giving the idea they had just arrived , fresh out of the ground			0
the resulting fog was part of the ‘ retail theatre ’ introduced by chief executive , @entity16 , who arrived from running a retail chain in @entity18 to spread a little magic over @entity2 and its sales			1
the misters keeping this asparagus fresh are soon to be a thing of the past at @entity2 the machines are to go , despite having been installed in some 300 @entity2 supermarkets however , it seems they were a little too fancy for customers of @entity2 , which has decided to pull down the curtain on this particular show			1
mr @entity16 was ousted last month following a vicious campaign from an old guard of company executives , including sir @entity35 , the former chairman and son of the founder of the chain			1
traditionally , @entity2 , which was founded in @entity39 in 1899 , built the layout of its stores around the theme of a street market with green grocer , butcher and baker			2
the set - up appealed to customers in the north , where the brand is strong , who had a reputation for being careful with their money			0
consequently , the decision to bring in the misting machines , which has since been copied by some other stores , was something of a surprise			0
now , after spending a large sum of money installing the machines in some 300 of the chain ’s supermarkets , the new management at @entity2 have decided to get rid of them			1
it is not a moment too soon for sir @entity35 , who has long argued the machines highlighted how mr @entity16 had alienated core shoppers , many of whom have switched to budget rivals @entity75 and @entity76			1
one of mr @entity16 ’s biggest critics , @entity78 , a former long - serving main board director , has been lobbying the company ’s chairman , @entity79 , to get rid of the machines			1
‘ you do n’t need misting			0
it is a waste of money , a waste of time and it does carry a risk unless you spend a significant amount on maintenance , ’ he said			0
‘ i said one of the first things @entity79 should do is take it out , which he obviously has done and good on him			0
former @entity2 chief executive @entity16 was ousted last month and now his misters are to go too ‘ if this is an indicator of his intention that he has already spoken about of getting the business back to its core values and core strengths , then this is a step in the right direction and a very , very visible one			1
’ @entity2 ’ group retail director @entity104 told staff about the decision to dump the misting machines earlier this week			2
a spokesman said : ‘ this move is about going back to basics , using simpler refrigeration techniques and @entity2 ’ traditional strengths in fresh food management to ensure our vegetables stay fresh			2
’ @entity2 did not actually fare too badly in recent sales figures compared to rivals the u-turn represents an end to what has been dubbed the ‘ war of fog ’ between mr @entity16 and his detractors			1
the former chief executive has always proudly defended the misting machines , which were used particularly in the @entity126 , where stores attract a more middle class shopper			2
he gave an interview to @entity130 last month saying : ‘ i will refute until my last day about taking the stores upmarket , we did not do that			2
' there are parts of the south of @entity137 which i think have benefitted from the slightly different assortment and i do n’t regret that			0
‘ @entity142 is in our competitors now			0
the most important thing is whether our customers liked it or not			0
’ the misting machines were part of a radical make - over for the @entity2 chain carried out by mr @entity16 , who became chief executive in 2010			1
he also introduced an online shopping service and began opening small convenience stores to tap into changing shopping habits			0
this week , industry sales figures were released suggesting his radical ideas were beginning to bear fruit , however the improvement came too late to save mr @entity16 and his job			1
figures from @entity163 show sales were down by 0.4per cent over the past 12 weeks compared to the same period last year			0
this was the best performance by the chain for a year and much better than @entity168 and @entity169 ’s .			0

‘ retail theatre ’ was introduced by former chief executive @entity16
mr @entity16 was ousted last month and the misters are now to go as well
this is despite the fact @entity2 installed them in 300 supermarkets
brings to an end the ‘ war of fog ’ between mr @entity16 and his critics , including former chairman sir @entity35 , son of the chain *'s* founder
