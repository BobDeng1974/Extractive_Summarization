two brothers have been reunited through @entity1 after losing touch and spending quarter of a century living on opposite sides of the world			2
@entity6 , 53 , and his younger brother @entity7 , 49 , lost contact with each other after their father 's funeral in 1989 , following which @entity7 travelled with the @entity13 before settling in @entity14			1
@entity6 , from @entity15 , south @entity16 , moved house , and despite both of them trying to contact the other , they failed to do so until earlier this year , when they finally met after finding each other through @entity1			1
@entity6 , 53 , left , and his brother @entity7 , 49 , were reunited after losing touch for quarter of a century the boys lost touch after their father 's funeral in 1989 , when @entity30 joined the @entity13 and went abroad @entity6 , a retired chef , said : ' he looks totally different			1
i do n't know if i 'd recognise him passing in the street			0
' his younger brother , who lives in @entity14 and no longer works for the @entity13 , explained how they lost touch			1
' our dad was our point of contact , so after he died we lost that , ' @entity7 said			2
' i struggled to grieve after losing my dad , and threw myself into work			0
' i travelled around a lot , so i was not easy to track down , and @entity6 had also moved			0
' while @entity7 sought to lose himself as he struggled with his grief , his older brother never forgot him , and each year bought a birthday card for @entity7 that he wrote but could not post			1
he said : ' all these years i never forgot his birthday			0
i bought him a card every year and used to write him emotional messages			0
' it helped when i was ill and had two strokes - it gave me someone to turn to			0
' every year , @entity6 bought his ' baby brother ' a birthday card , which he wrote and stored away for him when the brothers eventually spoke over the phone , @entity6 said : ' there were n't many words - we just sobbed ' ' found out i have cancer again ' : @entity6 's 2005 card tells of his health battles , adding : ' wish you were here xx ' but despite his faith that one day he would see his younger brother again , he had moments of doubt			1
' in 2012 i began to lose faith and wrote in his birthday card " i doubt we 'll see each other again " , ' he said			2
but the following year after doing some research on the internet he found his niece , @entity7 's daughter @entity74 , now 21 , on @entity1			1
@entity6 said : ' i contacted her to see if he was her father and incredibly she said yes			0
i could n't believe it			0
but the happy ending was postponed when either @entity77 or @entity7 wrote down @entity6 's email address wrong			1
' unbeknownst to me , @entity7 wrote me this long emotional email but it did n't get to me , ' @entity6 said			2
' that year i wrote in his card " i guess this is goodbye - i tried to get in touch but i have n't heard anything , so i suppose you 're not interested			0
" ' eventually , however , he made contact with @entity77 again , giving her his telephone number , and this time she put the two brothers in touch			1
last year 's card tells of @entity6 's despair as he signs of saying ' thought i had found you but maybe not xx ' so close : @entity6 said he wished his brother had been around to talk to as he battled with health problems this year 's card bears the message ' wish i could have time with you ' - and @entity6 's wish was finally granted ' @entity7 called me - i honestly could n't believe it , ' @entity6 said			1
' when he rang there were n't many words exchanged - we just cried			0
' i thought i was dreaming and when someone pinched me i 'd wake up			0
' after they spoke , @entity7 and his partner @entity108 , 41 , flew 11,000 miles from their home in @entity112 to @entity113 to visit @entity6 , who had n't been well at his home in @entity15			1
@entity6 , who suffered two strokes and was hospitalised four years ago for a lung condition , said he felt lucky he survived his illnesses to see his brother and sobbed as his sibling 's car pulled up outside his house			1
he said : ' i was scared we would n't ever see each other again , but i never gave up hope			0
we 're definitely not losing touch again			0
' finally , he presented his younger brother with the 25 birthday cards he had n't been able to send him			1
' sitting down to read the birthday cards together made us both very emotional , ' @entity6 said			2
' i never really got over my dad 's death and i clung to the hope i would see @entity7 again - which is shown in the messages i wrote to him			2
' some years i would write about what i 'd been through , and others i would just sign off ' @entity136 , your brother '			0
' @entity7 has quite a stiff upper lip through years of working with the @entity13 , but he got very upset reading them			2
