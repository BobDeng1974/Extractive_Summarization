by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 11:43 est , 2 january 2014 the first group of people to have the chance of starting a new colony on @entity6 by 2023 have been selected			1
@entity7 picked 1,058 people to progress to the next round in its search for humans who want to be the first to live , and die , on the @entity12			1
the hopefuls , who are all over the age of 18 , will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training starts in 2018			1
hopefuls will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training begins			1
the robotic mission to the @entity12 will launch in january 2018 with plans to send a colony of humans to @entity6 by 2023			1
this illustration shows what the settlement would look like the @entity7 project needs to raise $ 400,000 ( £ 245,000 ) by 25 january to fund its plans			0
once enough funding has been raised , the @entity36 firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on @entity6 as soon as october 2016			1
a ‘ settlement rover ’ will then land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity7 said will make the trips ‘ much safer than moon missions ’			1
the group said it aims to have a human settlement on @entity6 within a decade			1
journey time to @entity6 , which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days			1
the £ 4bn project , founded in 2010 by engineer @entity54 , is set to recoup its costs by selling the broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison , @entity52 's rover curiosity cost £ 1.8 billion			2
more than 200,000 people applied for a one - way ticket to @entity6 in a bid to become one of the first colonists , who are expected to settle on the planet by 2023			1
a total of 297 of the candidates to make the first cut are from the @entity22 while 75 are @entity67			1
@entity68 was the next best represented country with 62 candidates , followed by @entity70 with 52 , although the project originally set out to source applicants from 107 different countries			2
@entity74 , 21 , from the @entity75 and @entity76 , 29 , from @entity77 are among the @entity78 who made the first cut			2
almost 77 per cent of the people selected are employed , while 15 per cent are still at school , @entity79 reported			2
some 357 people are not yet 25 , while 415 have not yet celebrated their 35th birthday			2
the oldest person to make it to the next round is 81 , which means they will be 90 when the settlement lands			2
each was asked to explain why they would leave behind their loved ones and revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen to be shortlisted			0
@entity94 , co-founder of the @entity7 project , said the candidates are the first tangible glimpse of what a new human settlement will look like			0
‘ we ’re extremely appreciative and impressed with the sheer number of people who submitted their applications , ’ he said			0
‘ however , the challenge with 200,000 applicants is separating those who we feel are physically and mentally adept to become human ambassadors on @entity6 from those who are obviously taking the mission much less seriously			1
' we even had a couple of applicants submit their videos in the nude ! ’ the @entity36 - based project wants to launch a supply mission to land on @entity6 by october 2016			1
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity7 said will make the trips ' much safer than moon missions ' chief medical officer of @entity7 , dr @entity122 , said the next selection phases this year and in 2015 will include ’ rigorous simulations , many in team settings , with focus on testing the physical and emotional capabilities of our remaining candidates ’			1
‘ we expect to begin understanding what is motivating our candidates to take this giant leap for humankind			0
‘ this is where it really gets exciting for @entity7 , our applicants and the communities they ’re a part of , ’ he added			0
mr @entity54 said : ‘ we fully anticipate our remaining candidates to become celebrities in their towns , cities , and in many cases , countries			0
it ’s about to get very interesting			0
’ applicants who were not selected can still reapply at a later date , which has not yet been announced			0
the @entity6 lander and rover , illustration pictured , will be built by @entity154			1
this lander design will be based on the successful @entity6 lander used in the 2007 @entity52 @entity158 mission , which was also built and tested by @entity160 - based firm mr @entity54 said : ‘ @entity22 astronaut @entity161 was rejected by @entity52 for its astronaut training programme 15 times , yet in 2007 he boarded the @entity164 for a trip to the @entity166			1
he proved anything can happen and the door is never completely closed			0
’ it was announced just before @entity170 that in less than five years , a communications satellite could be installed on @entity6 to stream live images from the settlement into homes on @entity175			2
this would mean millions of eagle - eyed space enthusiasts could scour the live images for signs of alien life , or track changes in the weather , according to mr @entity54			0
the satellite is part of the wider @entity7 mission set to launch in january 2018 and will be built by @entity186 ( @entity186 ) - the company which was announced as one of the official partners of the plans just last week			0
in less than five years we could be live streaming images from @entity6 straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite , artist illustration pictured , on the @entity12			1
the satellite is part of the wider @entity7 mission set to launch in january 2018 it will provide a ' high bandwidth communications system in a @entity6 synchronous orbit ' and will be used to relay data and a live video feed from the lander on the surface of @entity6 back to @entity175			2
@entity7 is said to have paid @entity186 $ 60,000 ( £ 36,00 ) to design what will be the first ' geostationary ' satellite on the planet			0

this lander design will be based on the successful @entity6 lander used in the 2007 @entity52 @entity158 mission , which was also built and tested by @entity160 - based firm			1
the satellite , artist impression pictured , will provide a ' high bandwidth communications system ' to send data and live video back to @entity175 speaking at a news conference in december , mr @entity54 said : ' anyone with internet access will be able to see what the weather 's like on @entity6			2
' the robotic mission to the @entity12 will launch in january 2018 - two years later than initially planned			1
this unmanned mission is designed to explore and collect information about the planet with a view to launching a manned mission and setting up a @entity6 colony			1
@entity7 recently launched an @entity231 crowd - funding campaign			0

viewers would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave @entity175 in ten years ’ time			0
by 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers			0
the hopefuls , who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their training starts , said why they would leave behind their loved ones and revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen			1
by 2015 , the selected candidates will start an eight - year training regime where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation			2
in 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers			0
two living units , two life support units , a second supply unit , and another rover arrive on @entity6 the majority of applicants for the one - way trip to @entity6 came from the @entity22 , with @entity68 and @entity281 coming in second and third place			1
the second round will include an interview with @entity7 committee members , and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another			0
the third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and online			0

more than 200,000 people applied for a one - way ticket to @entity6
the first colony is expected to settle on the @entity12 by 2023
