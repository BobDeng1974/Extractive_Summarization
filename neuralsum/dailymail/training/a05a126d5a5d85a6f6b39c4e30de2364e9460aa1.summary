the cost of an average home will be close to £ 800,000 by the year 2040 , it has been revealed today			1
the figure was produced using a formula based on government data which included housing forecasts and future housing inflation			1
it predicts that a child aged six today would have to pay out an average of £ 780,000 to get the keys to a new property in 26 years time			1
the @entity24 reports this morning that the organisation produced the figures as part of its claims that extra homes needed to be built in ‘ garden cities ’ around @entity31			2
it comes after the think tank backed the @entity34 where architects were encouraged to submit proposals for garden cities			0
the house price forecast for 2040 was inspired by the fact a six - year - old boy had entered the competition , which was eventually won by design consultancy @entity41			2
the organisation 's head of housing and planning , @entity42 , told the @entity24 : ‘ @entity47 prices are on average ten times higher than earnings in @entity31			1
‘ this widens the gap between rich and poor , young and old , north and south			0
the situation is socially divisive and economically dangerous			0
‘ even those who have enjoyed seeing the value of their home increase are now beginning to worry about how their children will be able to afford a home			2

these deals are already common in parts of the country where house prices are high			0
but a report from the organisation said in future this could be a way of life for many			0
