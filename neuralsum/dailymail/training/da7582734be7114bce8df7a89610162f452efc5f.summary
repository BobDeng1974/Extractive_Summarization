@entity0 today insisted emergency legislation is needed to allow @entity3 ’s spies to access data about the public ’s phone calls , texts and emails			1
the prime minister said new laws are needed to reinstate powers to ' help keep us safe from those who would harm @entity3 citizens '			1
the laws - drawn up with backing from the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - will be rushed through @entity19 amid mounting concern about the threat posed to the @entity3 by jihadists returning from fighting in @entity23			1
@entity0 and @entity24 today announced plans for emergency spy laws at a press conferencein @entity27 the prime minister and deputy prime minister have struck a deal with @entity18 to pass laws which will last for two years forcing phone companies to keep records of calls and texts for 12 months an emergency cabinet meeting was held early this morning , and mr @entity0 and deputy pm @entity24 held a rare joint press conference in @entity39			1
in the @entity41 , home secretary @entity40 told mps : ' without this legislation , we face the prospect of losing access to this data overnight with the consequence police investigations will suddenly go dark and criminals will escape justice			2
we can not allow that to happen			0
' ministers insist the powers are not new , but will maintain the existing ability for the police and spy agencies to access data held by telecommunications companies			1
rather , it is intended to protect the ‘ capability ’ which the likes of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 are on the brink of losing			1
the emergency @entity68 and @entity69 will be rushed onto the statute book next week , after cross-party talks between mr @entity0 , his @entity17 deputy @entity24 and @entity18 leader @entity73			1
but critics condemned the ' stitch - up ' which will see the laws ' railroaded ' through @entity19 with little scrutiny			1
speaking alongside mr @entity24 in @entity39 this morning , the prime minister said the new laws were needed to catch terrorists and criminals			1
he said : ' unless we act now companies will no longer retain the data about who contacted who , where and when and we will no longer be able to use this information to bring criminals to justice and keep our country safe			2
' mr @entity24 insisted ' liberty and security must go hand in hand ' as he gave @entity17 backing to the plans home secretary @entity40 announced the emergency laws in the @entity41 today			1
she said people could not have freedom without security what powers do the police and @entity63 have ? in the wake of the july 7 attacks , an @entity104 directive meant telephone and internet companies have been obliged to keep customer records for 12 months			1
it covered details of the time , date and recipient of phone calls , texts and emails , but not the content			1
it is essentially what you might see on your monthly phone bill : who you called and when , but not what you said			0
security agencies argue it has proved crucial in smashing a series of terrorist plots , as well as organised crime syndicates and paedophile groups			2
so what has changed ? the directive was ruled unlawful by the @entity130 in april this year			0
its implementation by the @entity18 government in 2009 was said to be invalid because it interferes in a particularly serious manner with the fundamental right to respect for private life			0
as a result , ministers given a strict deadline to re-write @entity3 law or stop using the spy powers			1
what will new the laws mean ? ministers insist it replicates what was in place before april			2
it does not cover the content of calls or emails , which requires a warrant signed off by the home secretary			1
is n't this the snoopers ' charter ? the government insists not			1
the powers involved have been in place since 2006			2
the so - called snoopers ' charter , proposed by the @entity16 two years ago , was an extension of those powers			1
it would have covered details of every website which was clicked on , as well as direct messages on @entity167 and @entity168 and information exchanged between players in online video games			0
mr @entity0 added : it is used in 95 per cent or all serious organised crime cases handled by the @entity174			1
' it 's been used in every major security service counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade			0
it is the foundation for prosecutions of paedophiles , drug dealers and fraudsters			0
' the prime minister said some companies were already refusing to work with the government over fears they could be sued			1
he added : ' we face real and credible threats to our security from serious and organised crime , from the activity of paedophiles , from the collapse of @entity23 , the growth of @entity196 in @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity199			0
' i am simply not prepared to be a prime minister who has to address the people after a terrorist incident and explain that i could have done more to prevent it			1
' earlier , mr @entity0 said : ' it is the first duty of government to protect our national security and to act quickly when that security is compromised			1
' as events in @entity197 and @entity23 demonstrate , now is not the time to be scaling back on our ability to keep our people safe			0
' the ability to access information about communications and intercept the communications of dangerous individuals is essential to fight the threat from criminals and terrorists targeting the @entity3			0
' no government introduces fast track legislation lightly			0
but the consequences of not acting are grave			0
' i want to be very clear that we are not introducing new powers or capabilities – that is not for this @entity19			2
' this is about restoring two vital measures ensuring that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies maintain the right tools to keep us all safe			2
' the new law will expire in 2016 , when the next government will have to revisit the issue			0
after weeks of negotiations between the @entity17 and conservatives , agreement has now been reached to re-instate the powers			2
this will be done by writing them directly into @entity3 law rather than relying on the now unlawful 2006 @entity104 data retention directive			0
@entity246 ministers remain adamant that further powers are needed to reflect changes in technology since 2006 - but accept this will now have to wait until after the 2015 general election			1
the @entity17 remain implacably opposed to the so - called ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ – which would have given police and spy agencies even greater powers to monitor every telephone call , email and internet search in @entity3			1
deputy prime minister @entity24 said : ' we know the consequences of not acting are serious , but this urgency will not be used as an excuse for more powers , or for a ‘ snooper ’s charter ’			1
' i believe that successive governments have neglected civil liberties in the pursuit of greater security			0
we will be the first government in many decades to increase transparency and oversight , and make significant progress in defence of liberty			0
' but @entity276 and security must go hand in hand			0
we ca n’t enjoy our freedom if we ’re unable to keep ourselves safe			0
' under the plans announced today , a new @entity280 will be created to balance individual freedom against the need to tackle threats to national security and serious crimes			0
some public bodies including the @entity288 and the pensions regulator will lose their right to ask phone and web companies for the records			2
others , including councils , will have their access to records limited			2
annual transparency reports will be published to show hoe surveillance powers are being used			2
home secretary @entity40 arrives in @entity39 to brief an emergency cabinet meeting on the new laws the emergency laws will be passed by @entity19 next week after a deal between deputy prime minister @entity24 and @entity18 leader @entity73 police and spy agencies argue that being able to see who criminal suspects - or their victims - have called or emailed has played a crucial role in almost every major investigation			1
they claim it s particularly important for targeting serious criminals , including drug dealers , paedophiles and fraudsters			0
@entity39 said the killers of @entity319 schoolboy @entity318 , a gang of men who groomed young girls in @entity323 and a drugs gang operating in @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 in 2011 were all caught in part as a result of using mobile phone records			2
the government says it has also been used to stop crimes in while they are still in progress and save lives			0
but civil liberties groups say it is an extension of the surveillance state which treats everyone as a potential criminal			2
senior labour mp @entity341 condemned the way the laws were being rushed without giving @entity19 chance to scrutinise it properly			2
‘ the government were aware of this @entity130 ruling six weeks ago and what we are seeing now is they are railroading through legislation , ’ he told @entity346 ’s today programme			0
‘ no - one in civic society has got a chance to form a view on this			0
it ’s a stitch - up			1
‘ it is a secret deal between the three parties and it will go through next week as they have done this deal			0
’ @entity361 , head of the @entity362 , said : ' the government knows that since the @entity366 ruling , there is no legal basis for making internet service providers retain our data so it is using the threat of terrorism as an excuse for getting this law passed			0
' the government has had since april to address the @entity366 ruling but it is only now that organisations such as @entity362 are threatening legal action that this has become an ' emergency '			0
' the laws are intended to protect the ' capability ' which the likes of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 are on the brink of losing these three men all claim to have come from @entity3 and feature in an @entity196 video featuring young @entity3 jihadists encouraging @entity391 in the @entity392 to join them in @entity197 and @entity23 in a speech last month , home secretary @entity40 said the security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘ real and deadly ’ threat from jihadists			1
she said the conflicts in @entity23 and @entity197 had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from @entity401 by plane			0
at the same time , the internet has become a ‘ paradise ’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities			0
but mrs may added that the powers used to defeat @entity3 ’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology , leading to a collapse in @entity3 ’s capacity to protect its citizens			1
later this year , a report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee into the murder of the soldier @entity420 in @entity421 , southeast @entity401 , is expected to argue that - had @entity63 had greater internet surveillance powers - it could have helped to thwart the plot .			1

prime minister insists police and spy agencies must retain snooping powers
telecoms firms must keep records of calls , texts and emails for 12 months
the laws are intended to protect powers for @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64
@entity439 insists it is not an extension of the @entity442 ' charter
*extraordinary* cross-party deal between @entity0 , @entity24 and @entity73
critics condemn the ' stitch - up ' which will see laws ' railroaded through '
