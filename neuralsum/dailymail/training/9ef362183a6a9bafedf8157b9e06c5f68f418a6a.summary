by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 15:34 est , 15 november 2013 @entity1 could sue the @entity2 for big money under a variety of workplace laws - and could turn to his own legal eagle mother for advice			1
the employment legislation makes employers liable for bullying , harassment and discrimination - even if the team 's hierarchy did n't know about it , according to several legal experts			0
the @entity17 's special investigator , @entity16 , plans to meet in @entity18 today with @entity1 , who has been with his family in @entity20 and is receiving counseling			1
@entity2 owner @entity22 also plans to meet at a later date with @entity1			1
interestingly , @entity1 's mother , @entity24 , spent almost 20 years practicing employment law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as workplace discrimination and harassment			1
it 's not known whether she has any role in her son 's decisions ; @entity35 is now assistant general counsel for @entity36 in @entity20			1
the league is trying to gather information about the harassment @entity1 says he was subjected to by teammate @entity47			1
@entity1 and a companion arrived at lawyer @entity16 ' @entity50 office building and were met by a crush of reporters			1
the offensive lineman smiled but did not respond to questions while entering the building			0
suing the @entity2 could be more successful than bringing criminal charges against offensive lineman @entity47 , who was suspended by the @entity2 after fellow lineman @entity1 left the team two and a half weeks ago			1
@entity1 's attorney , @entity59 , says @entity1 was repeatedly harassed by @entity47 and others in ways that ' went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing '			1
@entity2 tackle @entity1 left the team over allegations of bullying for @entity1 to win a lawsuit , @entity67 law professor @entity66 said he 'd have to show precisely that			1
' it will be crucial for @entity1 to convince a jury that even with a rough workplace , there is a line that can not be crossed and it was crossed here , ' @entity66 said			1
one path for @entity1 to take would be filing a grievance with the @entity17 players union or a complaint with the @entity17 itself			1
aside from that , legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to sue the @entity2			0
@entity59 did not respond to an email asking for additional comment on any of these options			0
two labor - employment lawyers at @entity88 in @entity18 , @entity89 and @entity90 , said in a written analysis of the @entity1 matter that employers can face lawsuits related to bullying if the harassment involved a victim 's race , religion , sexual orientation or disability			1
@entity47 is accused of bullying his teammate @entity1 claims can be made for harassment , infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision			1
one voicemail that has surfaced from @entity47 to @entity1 , who is black , included a racial slur and other @entity2 players have said use of the slur in the locker room was not out of the ordinary			2
in addition , @entity89 and @entity90 said that @entity1 could claim that he was essentially forced to leave the @entity2 because of workplace harassment			2
' even if the @entity2 were unaware of @entity47 's alleged behavior , which may be the case , the organization could still face claims of liability , ' they said			0
there have also been reports that @entity47 was told by coaches to ' toughen up ' @entity1 , which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment , the two lawyers said			2
still , it 's no slam dunk for @entity1			2
for example , one allegation is that @entity1 forked over $ 15,000 for veteran @entity2 teammates to take a trip to @entity136 that he did not attend			2
that could be viewed in court as being a willing participant and make a harassment lawsuit harder to prove			0
if , @entity66 said : ' @entity1 seemed to be going along with the conduct willingly , then @entity1 can not now change his mind and decide that he did n't want to be part of the culture			2
' for @entity47 himself , the main issue would likely be his future @entity17 playing career			2
the @entity17 players ' union announced thursday that @entity47 has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the @entity2			0
the union statement says that @entity47 is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately			0
@entity154 , a law professor at the @entity155 , said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in @entity1 's favor should he take legal action			0
especially , she said , because he is a physically imposing @entity17 player — 6 - foot - 5 , 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses			0
' the fact that you have a 300 - pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves , that 's an indication of how serious it was , ' @entity154 said			0
from the criminal standpoint , former prosecutor @entity170 said it 's possible but not likely that @entity47 could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force @entity1 to pay the $ 15,000 for the vegas trip			0
another option would be written threats to do bodily harm , based on @entity47 's texts to @entity1 making threats about his mother			0
' however , i do n't really see the ( state prosecutors ) going after @entity47 , but i could be wrong , ' @entity170 said			0
@entity183 does have an anti-hazing law , but @entity66 said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces .			0

@entity17 special investigator , @entity16 , plans to meet today with @entity1 , who is with his family in @entity20 and is receiving counseling
