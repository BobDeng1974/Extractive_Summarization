it is an incredible image of oceans on another world			0
@entity3 today released this incredible mosaic showing the sun glinting off polar seas on titan , one of @entity10 's moons			2
this mirror - like reflection , known as the specular point , is in the south of @entity15 's largest sea , @entity16 , just north of an island archipelago separating two separate parts of the sea			1
this near - infrared , color mosaic from @entity3 's @entity22 spacecraft shows the sun glinting off of @entity15 's north polar seas			1

the near - infrared , color mosaic from @entity3 's @entity22 spacecraft shows the sun glinting off @entity15 's north polar seas			1
while @entity22 has captured , separately , views of the polar seas ( @entity32 ) and the sun glinting off of them ( see @entity35 and @entity36 ) in the past , this is the first time both have been seen together in the same view			0
the sunglint , also called a specular reflection , is the bright area near the 11 o'clock position at upper left			2
' this particular sunglint was so bright as to saturate the detector of @entity22 's @entity47 and @entity48 ( @entity22 ) instrument , which captures the view , ' @entity3 said			0
' it is also the sunglint seen with the highest observation elevation so far -- the sun was a full 40 degrees above the horizon as seen from @entity16 at this time -- much higher than the 22 degrees seen in @entity36			2
' the southern portion of @entity16 ( the area surrounding the specular feature toward upper left ) displays a ' bathtub ring ' - a bright margin of evaporate deposits - which indicates that the sea was larger at some point in the past and has become smaller due to evaporation			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity15 resembles a frozen version of @entity66 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			1
because @entity15 is smaller than @entity66 , its gravity does n't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			1
as on @entity66 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity15 are about seven @entity66 years long			1
@entity15 's ' water ' is liquid methane , @entity83 , better known on @entity66 as natural gas			1
regular @entity66 - water , @entity86 , would be frozen solid on @entity15 where the surface temperature is @entity88 ( -292 ° f )			1
with @entity15 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity66 's raindrops			1
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
the deposits are material left behind after the methane & ethane liquid evaporates , somewhat akin to the saline crust on a salt flat			0
the highest resolution data from this flyby -- the area seen immediately to the right of the sunglint -- cover the labyrinth of channels that connect @entity16 to another large sea , @entity112			2
@entity112 itself is partially covered in its northern reaches by a bright , arrow - shaped complex of clouds			0
@entity15 has a global circulation pattern in which warm air in the summer hemisphere wells up from the surface and enters the stratosphere , slowly making its way to the winter pole			2
there , the air mass sinks back down , cooling as it descends , which allows the stratospheric methane clouds to form			0
the clouds are made of liquid methane droplets , and could be actively refilling the lakes with rainfall			0
the view was acquired during @entity22 's august 21 , 2014 , flyby of @entity15 , also referred to as ' @entity132 ' by the @entity22 team			2
the view contains real color information , although it is not the natural color the human eye would see			0
here , red in the image corresponds to 5.0 microns , green to 2.0 microns , and blue to 1.3 microns			0
these wavelengths correspond to atmospheric windows through which @entity15 's surface is visible			1
the unaided human eye would see nothing but haze , as in @entity146 .			0

mirror - like reflection is in the south of @entity15 's largest sea , @entity16
reflection just north of an island archipelago separating two separate parts of the sea
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity15 resembles a frozen version of @entity66 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere
