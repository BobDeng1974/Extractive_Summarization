she stormed to victory in this year ’s @entity2 with her spectacular edible creations			1
now @entity4 has designed a @entity6 showstopper bake — and shares the recipe exclusively with the @entity8 so you can make it at home			1
this stunning @entity12 comes complete with a caramel halo and wings , a piped - icing skirt , hands clasped in prayer and long blonde hair			1
for those who fear that assembling the ingenious cake may be beyond them , mrs @entity4 has friendly words of advice			1
she said : ‘ i hope people will improvise and use their own creativity			0
it does n’t matter if you cheat a bit , or do things a different way			1
you might come up with a better solution than me			0
the main thing is to have fun while you are making it			1
ready , steady , cook : gather all the ingredients you need to start baking the spectacular @entity12 recipe ‘ i do n’t like the @entity56 school of cookery , where everything is complicated and takes ages			1
food should be enjoyable to make and eat			1
’ the grandmother - of - eight , from @entity62 in @entity63 , said her @entity12 has been designed to appeal to all the family			1
the head is made from a ball of @entity67 , chocolate and marshmallows , which will keep sweet - toothed children happy on christmas day			1
finishing touches : ms @entity4 uses a piping bag filled with royal icing to create the angel 's lacy skirt now , on with the head : stick a dowel into the angel 's head and then attach it to the body section of the cake the body is a traditional @entity6 cake baked in a 4 in tin			1
and the skirt is a homemade panettone stuffed with @entity6 spices and fruit , which can be toasted and eaten long after @entity89			1
mrs @entity4 said : ‘ all the components of the cake will keep for ages , and they are easy to make			1
‘ but if people want to use a ready - made panettone instead of making their own , that ’s fine by me			1
they are cheap and readily available			0
’ call in @entity96 : create a wooden frame - and use it to fix two dowels to the molten caramel wings if bought from scratch , all of the ingredients for the @entity12 should cost about £ 60 , although many people will already have most of the staple ingredients in their cupboards			1
home bakers should start making the cake the day before so the panettone can rise overnight			2
the @entity6 cake can also be made at this stage as it takes between five and six hours to bake			0
the following day , the skirt , body and head should be decorated with runny icing , shop - bought coloured fondant icing , ready - to - roll marzipan and edible lace			1
the parts are then stacked one on top of the other using wooden rods on the inside to hold them together — although knitting needles would do equally well			0
the wings and halo are made from caramel mixed with edible gold glitter to catch the light			1
be precise : make another tool with two dowels the right width apart and angle in order to create two holes mr @entity136 , 63 , devised an ingenious method for attaching the wings to the angel ’s back with two wooden dowels			1
the rods should be fixed into the caramel while it is still molten , using a wooden frame to hold them at a 30 degree angle until it cools			2
meanwhile , a corresponding pair of holes must be made in the angel ’s back , also at 30 degrees			2
then , with a bit of luck and a steady hand , the wings can be slotted in place to give the cake a special lift			1
mrs @entity4 said her creation is meant to be a ‘ fallen angel ’ , adding : ‘ her halo has slipped over one eye , and although she is doing her best to pray you can tell she is the naughty child in angel school			1
’ @entity166 : attach the wings to the angel 's back using the holes you have created - now you 're nearly finished she and her husband have five children and eight grandchildren between them and will host the entire family on christmas day			1
she said : ‘ i enjoy all the traditions , so we will have roast turkey that we have reared in our back garden , pigs in blankets , sprouts , stuffing and all the rest			0
‘ we go to midnight mass the night before , then have a big lunch on christmas day before opening our presents by the tree			0
‘ i always prepare most of it well in advance so there is a minimum of fuss , and i do n’t get stuck in the kitchen while everyone else is having a drink			2
’ final adjustments : make sure the angel 's wings are secure and - now stand back to admire your work ! in the bake off final in october , mrs @entity4 made a spectacular windmill cake designed to look like the famous @entity205 cabaret in @entity206			1
to mould the caramel roof , she used a gadget made by her husband — a retired gp — from an old drainpipe			2
but he refused to take any credit for her victory , saying : ‘ i do n’t get involved in the kitchen , but i like making things in my workshop			2
so if i can invent something that helps her construct her showstopper cakes , i will			0
she is the brains of the operation			0
’ my angel showstopper cake comprises a panettone which forms the skirt			2
the body is my traditional @entity6 cake and the head is made of a @entity67 mix — the children love it ! @entity233 mix flour , salt , sugar , yeast , milk and eggs for 10 minutes on low setting until dough is smooth			0
add butter and mix for further 10 minutes until soft			0
place the dough in a greased bowl , cover and leave in the fridge overnight			0
stir in the fruits , zests , spices and @entity251 , cover and leave overnight			0
next morning , mix contents together			0
grease the @entity254 tin then dust with flour			0
shape the dough into a sausage then place in tin , and leave at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours			0
preheat oven to 180 c and bake for 20 minutes ; then 150 c for 25 minutes			0
invert tin on to a cooling rack			0
christmas cake soak fruit in the @entity251 for several hours			0
cream butter and sugar together then beat in eggs			0
then fold in the flour and spices and add soaked fruit			0
spoon into greased and lined 4 in tin			0
bake at 100 c for 5 to 6 hours			0
for the angel 's head melt butter in saucepan then add marshmallows			2
as they melt , add @entity67 and chocolate and mix. @entity280 into two small greased sphere tins			0
leave to go cold , then push the two halves together to make a ball			2
to assemble the angel mix egg white and 300 g icing sugar to make a smooth , stiff piping icing			1
mix a quantity of runny icing , using lemon juice and 300 g icing sugar and drizzle over the panettone			2
using 125 g marzipan , cover the cake and place on a 6 in board			0
cover with ready - to - roll fondant			2
using pink ready - to - roll fondant , cover the head			2
other colours for hair , eyes etc. use edible lace for the angel ’s sleeve and collar			2
i then used cake dowels to fix the head on to the body and the body to the skirt			2
the finishing piped icing to the skirt and sleeve edges etc was done with the royal icing			1
wings and halo made with edible gold glitter and a caramel made from 300 g sugar and water			1
to make the caramel , put the sugar into a pan with just enough water to dampen it			1
gently stir the sugar , without boiling , until the grains have all disappeared			0
use a pastry brush dipped in water to get rid of any crystals of sugar clinging to the sides of the pan			0
once clear , add the edible glitter and bring to a boil until the syrup begins to thicken and turn golden brown			0
shape it into wings and a halo on some greaseproof paper and allow to cool			1
fix dowels to wings with hot caramel then insert to back of cake .			1
