it ’s a measure of how well @entity1 has played in his first five games for @entity3 that he is yet to score and there is not so much as a murmur of discontent from supporters towards the £ 65m striker			1
@entity9 dubbed him ‘ @entity20 ’ after he came off the bench at half time to set up both goals in a 2 - 1 comeback against @entity15 recently and he has earned the ‘ @entity17 ’ nickname with four assists in four league appearances			1
this is not the first time goals have been hard to come by at a new club			0
when he finally made it into the first - team of his boyhood club @entity27 in @entity29 he struggled to find the back of the net			0
@entity1 has yet score for @entity3 since his £ $ 65million move from @entity33 during the summer @entity1 set up @entity34 ( above ) for @entity3 's third goal during his side 's recent 5 - 1 win over @entity38 @entity1 ( right ) made his @entity3 debut against @entity40 and set up @entity41 after only four minutes in his autobiography crossing the line released last month he recalls : “ at first , i missed chances			1
lots and lots of them			0
it reached the point where people insulted me and whistled me			0
they called me burro meaning ‘ donkey ’			0
even now i meet people who say to me : " i used to insult you , i used to shout at you , i was one of those people who thought you were never going to score any goals "			0
' but at @entity3 there ’s no such abuse from supporters because it ’s not so much a case of missing chances as not having had them yet			0
his only clear - cut chance so far came against old club @entity63 on an emotional night in the @entity64 when his shot was parried by the keeper after he ran on to a @entity68 pass			2
but for the most part the golden shoe has become the silver platter serving up goal scoring opportunities on a plate for team - mates			0
he set - up @entity41 to score after only four minutes of his debut at the @entity76 and then played @entity68 in to score what would have been the second only for the @entity78 to see his shot saved by @entity79			1
@entity1 has struck up a great relationship , on and off the field , with @entity3 superstar @entity68 ( right ) @entity68 , now @entity82 top score of all all time , is @entity3 's most prolific marksman with @entity1 providing support as well as the two assists in one half in that game against @entity15 he created @entity3 ’s third goal in their 5 - 1 win over @entity38 on saturday with a run and cross for @entity34 to head in			1
critics , and there are currently none among @entity3 supporters , will say he was signed to score goals but @entity68 scores the majority of @entity3 ’s goals and has been doing so ever since @entity97 converted him to a centre - forward in 2009			1
in that 2009 - 10 campaign he got 34 goals ; 31 came in the following season ; in 2011 - 12 he scored 50 , he got 46 in 12 - 13 and last season he reached 28 league goals despite taking a month off mid-season			2
@entity105 could not adapt to playing alongside @entity68 and left @entity3 after just one season			2
@entity107 ( left ) and @entity108 both saw their goal tallies drop after they moved to @entity3 the two have struck up a good relationship off and on the field – both partial to the @entity115 herbal drink so traditional in @entity78 and @entity29 – and both sharing a joke on monday when the draw for next year ’s @entity119 pitted the two countries together in the same group although @entity1 ’ on - going international ban will prevent him from playing			1
rather than take @entity68 ’s top marksman ’s job at @entity3 , the team needed @entity1 to give them back the high - pressing intensity that has been lost in the last couple of seasons			1
he has been able to do that and the quality of some of his assists from his new position on the right of the front three have more than made up for the lack of goals so far			0
even when he does start scoring recent history suggests it is unlikely the goals will come in the same quantities as at @entity33			2
he will not be the first player to have been a record goalscorer elsewhere whose goal count drops at @entity3			0
on top of all his achievements at club level , @entity1 is top scorer in the history of the @entity29 national team @entity41 got 14 goals in 17 league games in his last year at @entity152 but only nine in 25 in his first season with @entity3			1
@entity155 ’s all - time top scorer @entity108 fared the same			1
he scored 107 goals in 166 league games for @entity158 but when he moved to @entity3 he netted only 33 in 77 matches			2
@entity107 ’s goals return also dropped once he had left @entity161 to play alongside @entity68			2
@entity1 has adapted his game just as @entity107 and @entity108 did			0
playing to the right of @entity68 there is licence to switch to a more central position but the change is usually initiated by the @entity78			0
those who can not or will not adapt to playing alongside @entity68 tend to leave the club with @entity105 doing so after just one season			2
@entity1 might have broken his duck at the weekend but before the ball could reach him at the far post @entity68 had darted in ahead of him to send it over the line			0
it was the goal that saw @entity68 break the all - time league record and @entity1 found himself congratulating a team - mate again , instead of taking the plaudits himself			1
@entity1 , in action against @entity181 for @entity33 , was top - assist provider in last seasons @entity184 having scored over 100 times for @entity63 , becoming the top scorer in the history of the @entity29 national team and , along with @entity189 , getting more league goals than any other player in @entity192 last season , it is no wonder his coach @entity195 says : ' i do n’t think anyone doubts that @entity1 is going to score a lot of goals for @entity3			1
' @entity1 was top - assist provider last season in the @entity184 and he is capable of repeating that in @entity155			1
but he will not want to finish too far down the goal charts in his first season and tuesday night , against @entity205 , who are bottom of @entity207 with only one point , might be the perfect time to get started			0
@entity3 boss @entity195 is in no doubt that @entity1 will start scoring goals at the @entity212 very soon			1

@entity1 not scored for @entity3 since his £ 65million move to the @entity216 *giants* from @entity33 in the summer
@entity1 , however , has provided five assists for his new club
@entity1 set up @entity41 to score after only four minutes of his debut in his side 's 3 - 1 loss to @entity40 at the @entity76 in *october*
@entity1 came off the bench at half - time to set up both goals in @entity3 's recent 2 - 1 comeback *victory* against @entity15
he created @entity3 ’s third goal in their 5 - 1 win over @entity38 on saturday
@entity1 has struck up a good relationship with @entity68 , both on and off the pitch , at @entity3
@entity3 boss @entity195 is is no doubt that @entity1 's goals will come
@entity1 was top - assist provider last season in the @entity184
