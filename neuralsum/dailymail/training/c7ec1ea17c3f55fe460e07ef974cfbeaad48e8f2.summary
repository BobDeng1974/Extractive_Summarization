by @entity0 shock : dr @entity2 said life expectancy gaps in @entity4 were a ' human rights abuse ' the archbishop of @entity7 has said @entity4 should not be ' smug ' when they see poverty in @entity9 because gaps in life expectancy in the @entity4 are a ' human rights abuse '			1
@entity2 said shocking photos from @entity14 ahead of the @entity15 , where plush hotels sit alongside poverty - stricken favelas , were not the only story of inequality in the world			1
instead he said poverty , poor education , unemployment , high crime levels and isolation affected towns , cities , villages and the countryside in @entity4 and the rest of the @entity31			1
the 64 - year - old archbishop , who is leading an inquiry into whether to introduce a national ' living wage ' , told a conference today @entity4 was lagging behind the rest of @entity37			2
the nation needs to tackle health and income inequality , youth unemployment and relatively low levels of happiness in children compared with other countries , he told the international fairness conference in @entity7			0
he singled out gaps in life expectancy between richest and poorest neighbourhoods saying that this was ' perhaps the biggest human rights abuse ' in rich developed countries - worse , perhaps than a similar period of detention without trial			0
' within almost all @entity4 cities there are differences in life expectancy between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods of anywhere from five to 12 years , ' he added			1
dr @entity2 spoke after figures revealed babies born in leafy suburbs of @entity65 , @entity66 , can expect to live up to 20 years longer than those in @entity68 , @entity69			1
boys born in @entity65 and @entity71 can expect to live to 70.3 years and girls 71.3 years - but 220 miles away , babies in @entity68 can expect to live to only 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 for girls			1
the figures were released in march by the @entity77			0
dr @entity2 said he believed a large part of the difference in life expectancies was due to ' psycho social ' factors such as social status and experiences in early childhood			2
wide gulf : figures released in march ( pictured ) showed a huge gap in life expectancy across @entity89 ' as a nation we need to protect the principles of ( @entity101 ) @entity100 that allow each man , woman and child access to health care whenever they need it , ' he said			1
' but we also need to work hard on building safe and caring communities in which people can flourish			0
' he added that income inequality seemed to make societies ' more anti-social '			2
' by increasing social status differences - and social distances - greater inequality increases all the problems associated with social status - drugs , violence , poor educational performance , teenage births , ' he said			0
' greater income inequality has so many damaging effects because it amplifies and strengthens all the ways in which social class imprints itself on us throughout life			0
' have - nots : dr @entity2 said images of poverty in @entity14 ( pictured ) should n't make @entity4 feel ' smug ' if we want a happier and less divided society , he said , than reducing the scale of income differences between rich and poor would be an ' important step forward ' , he said			1
dr @entity2 ’s spoke in november of his shock at reading of a rise in hospital admissions for malnutrition and food poverty within his own diocese , a phenomenon he described as ' a dark stain on our consciences '			2
he said the need for @entity145 action was now more urgent than ever as ' hard - pressed ' people found they were on a ' down escalator ' in life			0
dr @entity2 is the chairman of the @entity149 , which is examining the case for introducing a “ @entity151 ” of £ 8.80 in @entity152 and £ 7.65 outside the capital			0
the commission is due to report later this month and its findings could be made law by the government .			0
