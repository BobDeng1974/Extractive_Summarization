a new map of the fault lines underneath @entity2 has revealed the major landmarks at risk if an earthquake hits @entity6			1
the new maps , the first issued by the @entity8 in almost 20 years , reveal a new path for a major fault line in the area			1
hotels , schools and even a church are now right on the fault line , it reveals - with much of the area 's @entity17 at risk			1
the @entity32 extends east - northeast for about 17 km through densely populated areas , including the cities of @entity47 , @entity2 , and the community of @entity2 within the @entity6 , trending eastward to the @entity49			1
the buildings now affected include landmarks such as the @entity25 in @entity2 , the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity29 hotels in @entity2 , three elementary schools , a performing arts college and @entity53 and @entity54			1
a total of about 12,000 properties lie in the newly drawn fault zones , roughly 500 feet on each side of estimated fault lines			1
however , some believe the maps are wrong			1
@entity62 , the ceo @entity64 consulting , has carried out test in the areas said to be in the fault line - and found nothing			1
' the first site we investigated on the map does not have a fault on it , ' he told @entity75			1
he called for the maps to be delayed while more work is carried out on the exact location of the fault			1
' the big question is , is the map right - and that 's still an open question , ' he claims			2
' there is a possibility that the map could be approved with the wrong information			1
' there is a very high degree of uncertainly over this			0
' they need to withhold finalisation of the map until more information is available			2
' reader said the map could even impact existing buildings , such as hotels , ability to expand or remodel			2
@entity103 's @entity102 on @entity105 street is , according to the new map , in the middle of a fault line			1
' there 's a lot of unanswered questions , ' @entity109 , senior pastor at @entity103 's , told the @entity113			0
' we have to figure out : do we have to change anything ? ' the maps were released under the authority of the @entity118 ( @entity119 ) act that was passed following the @entity122 earthquake			0
the @entity120 is a state law designed to reduce the hazard from surface fault rupture during an earthquake			2
the maps reveal the fault zones the government says are most at risk			2
' @entity130 are regulatory zones that encompass surface traces of active faults that have a potential for future surface fault rupture , ' the @entity8 said			2
the @entity136 @entity137 @entity27 new developments will be restricted within the fault zones			2
owners wanting to build would have to do underground seismic testing , which is the only definitive way to locate a fault			2
' the principal traces of the @entity2 fault are recommended for zoning , as they are believed to be still active , ' the report concluded			1
public schools are already working on research to see how at risk they are			0
the @entity150 has begun an underground study to see whether the @entity2 fault runs underneath @entity152 , and in the past has demolished classroom buildings found to be on top of faults			1
the aftermath of the 1984 @entity158 : experts say the fault zone may be larger than previously thought a fault is a fracture in the crust of the earth along which rocks on one side have moved relative to those on the other side			1
most faults are the result of repeated displacements over a long period of time			0
a fault trace is the line on the earth 's surface defining the fault , which for zoning purposes is defined as one that has ruptured in the last 11,000 years			2
surface rupture occurs when movement on a fault deep within the earth breaks through to the surface			0
surface ruptures associated with the @entity187 , in @entity188 , extended for 50 miles with displacements of an inch to 20 feet			0
not all earthquakes result in surface rupture			0
the @entity193 of 1989 caused major damage in the @entity195 but the movement deep in the earth did not break through to the surface			0
fault rupture almost always follows preexisting faults , which are zones of weakness			0
rupture may occur suddenly during an earthquake or slowly in the form of fault creep			0
sudden displacements are more damaging to structures because they are accompanied by shaking			0
the @entity32 is located along the southern boundary of the @entity209 , where @entity211 granitic rocks ; mainly quartz diorite , and @entity214 biotite granodiorite , are unconformably overlain by folded and faulted early to middle @entity216 marine siltstones , sandstones , and basaltic volcanic rocks , and late @entity220 marine sandstones , siltstones and shales			0
the @entity223 has also begun searching for the fault shown crossing the campus of @entity226			0
however , some firms say the maps are wrong - and are causing a major problem			0
an earthquake fault line should not be drawn underneath @entity231 , one of @entity2 ’s largest residential and commercial projects , a lawyer for the developer claimed earlier this month			1
the lawyer , @entity236 , told the state mining and @entity238 that the fault line drawn by the @entity8 ' is not clearly detectable … and therefore is not sufficiently well - defined to be included on the map			1
' @entity241 , which co-owns the @entity243 building and is seeking to build two skyscrapers next to it , also says the state 's fault map is wrong			1
@entity241 's geologists have taken soil samples and plan to dig a trench			0
' we are confident the trenching will corroborate our previous investigations and demonstrate conclusively that no active fault exists on our site , ' @entity251 , one of the developers at @entity241 , said in a statement			0
luxury hotels could also be hit , with the @entity26 , the @entity261 and the @entity29 all close to the @entity29 ' will take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their guests , which could potentially include structural assessment or seismic investigation , ' spokeswoman @entity259 told the @entity269 of the @entity261 and the @entity26 declined to comment .			0

*controversial* new map is first to be published in almost two decades
more than 1,500 developed properties are affected
one map shows the path of the @entity2 fault going directly under a church
experts claim the map is wrong and could stifle development in @entity6
