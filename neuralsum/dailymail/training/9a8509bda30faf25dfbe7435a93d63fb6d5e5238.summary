@entity2 bolts in his chair , pupils dilated			1
the conversation has moved on to how much it really means to pull on a @entity6 shirt			1
‘ it ’s the most important thing for us , without doubt , ’ he says			2
‘ look at the players who have pulled on that jersey throughout history			2
you are one of them			2
’ and so the @entity16 man recounts the names			2
@entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , even @entity21			2
‘ it means so much to me			0
when i was young i saw the national team with this pride and history			0
’ in the build - up to what should prove to be a @entity28 to beat any of the previous three , the @entity29 know what they are and know exactly what they ought to achieve			1
looking at the 23 they ’re taking , it ’s difficult to argue with @entity2 when he bluntly offers : ‘ our goal is the title – it must be with this team			1
’ into the final four of the last three tournaments since @entity62 left eight years ago , the belief now is that it ’s time to stop falling at the last			2
there are , @entity2 divulges , compelling reasons why ; key men including @entity67 and @entity68 have reached their peak , while the emergence of younger supplements makes @entity6 a very exciting prospect indeed			1
‘ the team is quite young , ’ he adds			0
‘ we ’ve got @entity75 , @entity76 , myself … @entity19 is still young too			1
’ focus immediately pins on @entity76			1
it has n’t been difficult to see why @entity80 remain so desperate to add the @entity81 forward			1
the 24 - year - old - who singlehandedly beat @entity84 in a @entity86 quarter - final second leg in april - has now added consistency in front of goal to his ingenuity on the ball , making him one of the most revered talents on the continent			2
‘ the way he played during the last few months for @entity81 was quite incredible - he scored or assisted every match			1
technique , pace and that right foot – it ’s fantastic			0
he ’s a very intelligent footballer as well			0
‘ i know him well – @entity76 is one of my best friends in football			1
’ hotshot : @entity81 's @entity76 is one to watch out for when the @entity28 starts next month mates : @entity76 and @entity2 are very close , with the close - knit group one of the reasons why they 're so potent and with that @entity2 reveals just why the @entity29 are so dangerous , beyond their obvious charm in possession and doggedness without it			1
this team has grown up together			0
‘ it feels like a family , ’ the 23 - year - old says			0
‘ we ’ve played together for the last four years			0
we ’ve got big players of great quality and have two players for each position			0
you know what he wants on the pitch and how you should play a ball			0
that ’s going to be an advantage for us			0
‘ everybody sticks together and knows each other			0
it ’s been a long time now and we ’ve a good mix. ’ @entity133 ’s defiant line that there ’d be no point @entity136 travelling to @entity34 not believing they could win it was admirable , but it ’s questionable whether he himself really feels @entity140 will be tootling up the @entity142 steps to collect silverware			1
for @entity6 – with the undisputed talent at @entity48 ’s disposal – the time is now			1
twenty - four years is too long			0
like a family : most of the @entity29 squad have played with each other for the past four years passing it on : @entity48 has been in charge since 2006 when @entity153 boss @entity62 left his post that ’s the message from above , driven by the silent patriarch @entity67 and radiating down			1
‘ he is n’t the one to motivate everyone , ’ @entity2 reasons			1
‘ @entity67 is calm and has seen everything , even in the most difficult situation			1
he plays every game brilliantly , so easy , as if it ’s nothing			0
he never makes mistakes – exactly what a captain needs to do			0
‘ he has his own ideas and knows what he ’s talking about			0
if he talks to you it always makes sense			0
’ talk then turns to @entity6 ’s group : very tough on paper , and potentially more difficult in reality			1
@entity176 are first up before @entity177 and @entity62 ’s @entity52			1
does the opening game set the tone for the tournament , particularly if @entity181 is kept quiet ? ‘ you ca n’t think like this , ’ @entity2 replies			1
‘ we ’ve two games to go after that			0
it ’s important to remain calm			0
if you lose then you start thinking everything ’s over already and it is n’t			0
it ’s a difficult group , but we should win all three games			2
‘ i do n’t think you can stop @entity181 for the whole 90 minutes because of his individual class			0
we have the players of our own though			0
@entity67 plays against him and knows him quite well after the games between @entity84 and @entity197			1
‘ @entity67 is the best full back in the world			1
he can play in midfield , too , but for me if @entity181 plays on the wing @entity67 has to be there			1
’ marker : captain @entity203 should be given the task of seeing off @entity181 in the opening game how long left ? @entity68 could be playing in his last @entity28 for @entity6 this summer it appears he may have a point			1
@entity208 opted to play his skipper at left - back against @entity84			0
@entity181 up against @entity211 was on the other flank and took @entity197 apart in the @entity213 , scoring twice to book their place in saturday ’s final against @entity215			2
recent painful memories for @entity67 and @entity68 could either inspire or cripple			1
@entity2 is left in no doubt which			2
‘ i think they ’re even hungrier now because they want to win a big title , ’ he claims			0
‘ i do n’t know how many @entity221 and @entity68 are going to play in the future , so they want to win this			2
‘ it ’s something they do n’t have			0
’ not yet at least			0
if any side are to break the @entity52 stranglehold , it ’s @entity6			1
@entity2 was appearing at a photoshoot to celebrate the launch of @entity46 , the highly anticipated and first true next - gen video game from @entity232 , out to own on may 27th on @entity233 4 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity233 ® 3 , and @entity236 .			2

@entity48 's side not looking for *climate* *excuses* over in @entity34
@entity6 have a tough group with @entity176 , @entity153 and @entity177
@entity2 tips @entity81 's @entity76 to be a star at the tournament
@entity67 's composure will be key , while it could be @entity68 's final @entity28
