but he challenged the ruling and @entity41 judges struck it out			0
yesterday , @entity43 justices ruled in favour of ms @entity0 and said her claim should be heard by a judge in the @entity47 of the @entity47			1
she is demanding almost £ 2million			0
lord @entity49 , speaking for all five justices , said that under 1973 divorce legislation the courts should have taken into account the years ms @entity0 looked after the couple 's son			1

' she struggled to do so			0
they were 16 years of real hardship for her and her family			0

lord @entity49 added : ' unwisely , miss @entity0 has pitched her claim at £ 1.9million and it is obvious … that an award approaching that size is out of the question			1
her claim may even be dismissed			0

@entity43 judges – @entity91 , @entity92 , lord @entity49 , @entity93 and @entity94 – said appeal judges had been wrong to throw ms @entity0 's original case out on the basis she had no reasonable grounds , in 2013			1

@entity109 , of firm @entity110 , said : ' it amounts to nothing short of a call to action … [ it ] underlines how there is no limit on when someone can make a claim			2
it does n't matter whether you divorce in your 20s and return with a claim when you 're 80			2
' there was no recorded financial settlement from ms @entity0 's divorce			1
' but there is … a real prospect that she will secure a comparatively modest award , perhaps of a size which would enable her to purchase a somewhat more comfortable mortgage - free home			0
' ms @entity0 's solicitor , @entity72 of law firm @entity133 , said : ' she looks forward to concluding the litigation as quickly as possible			1
' ms @entity72 added that @entity135 would try to win a costs order against mr @entity3 to cover its fees , which have so far swallowed up all but £ 2,539 of the £ 125,000 awarded to ms @entity0 in the earlier court hearing			1
after the ruling , mr @entity3 said : ' i am disappointed that the @entity43 has decided not to bring this case to an end now , over 30 years since the relationship ended			1
' we both moved on and started families of our own			0
' for my part the passing of time is extremely prejudicial , it 's been so long that there are no records … it 's hard to defend yourself in such circumstances			0
indeed , the delay itself has enabled the claim , because there is no paperwork in existence			0
' he added : ' i feel that we all have a right to move on and not be looking over our shoulders			0
this could signal open season for people who had brief relationships a quarter of a century ago			0
it 's mad in my opinion			0
