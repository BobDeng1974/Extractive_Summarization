so @entity0 has taken his leave , in his 41st year , from the playing ranks of the only club he ever served			1
@entity5 , his comrade in many @entity7 glories , joked that @entity0 collected so many gold medals he puts @entity9 , of @entity11 fame , to shame			1
includes two @entity14 cups , 13 @entity16 titles , four @entity17 and four @entity18 , making him the most decorated player in the history of the @entity23 game			1
he husbanded his physical gifts in a way redolent of the long careers of the old knights , sir @entity42 and sir @entity43			2
when he put on his suit for the first match of his short stint as interim manager last month , he was as svelte a figure as any seen on the touchline			0
the wiry , teenage @entity0 had preserved himself as if in aspic to play nearly 1,000 games for @entity7			1
no wonder the sportswriter @entity53 observed that @entity0 was the rare player ‘ to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still on the pitch ’			1
that , however , points to the problem with any critical appreciation of the man			0
he has become a myth			0
the facts have been clouded by sentiment and wrapped in hyperbole			1
nothing demonstrated this more clearly than his being named 2009 @entity67			0
he did not deserve the award on the evidence of those 12 months			0
it was bestowed on him in a fuzzy , sepia - tinged urge to recognise his longevity			0
myths are not always outright lies , though			0
they are often fact embellished by fiction			0
so , even though @entity0 only retired from playing yesterday , we should perhaps start to try to disentangle fact from fiction			2
and one fiction , it seems to me , is the assertion that he is the greatest player in the @entity16 ’s 22 - year history			1
winner : @entity0 won 34 major honours in a glittering career at @entity88 honours : they included 13 titles , four @entity17 and two @entity92 titles invincibles : @entity36 players celebrate winning the league at @entity97 during their unbeaten season trademark : @entity24 scored 175 goals for @entity36 , the most by a player for a single club in the @entity16 i would contend that @entity24 , @entity36 ’s most brillant light when they went uniquely unbeaten all season , is worthy of that accolade			1
his graceful speed , his incisive runs , his nerveless finishing have imprinted themselves most vividly on my mind			0
he scored 175 @entity16 goals , more than anyone else at a single club			2
there are other worthy contenders : the miserly @entity116 , the footloose @entity117 , the balletic @entity118 , the forceful @entity119 , the lethal @entity120 , the ingenious @entity121 , the imperious @entity122 , the skilful @entity123 , the cottage industry of @entity125			1
@entity0 is worthy of comparison with them all , but we are left to ponder whether he entirely delivered on the promise that thrilled us when he was a 17 - year - old winger with scampering feet			1
undeserved : @entity0 won the 2009 @entity67 as a nod to his longevity long game : @entity0 burst on to the scene as a wiry teenager at the end of the 1990 - 91 season - before the formation of the @entity16 match - winners : @entity122 ( left ) , @entity117 and @entity139 ( below ) were always bigger stars when they played alongside @entity0 - the @entity138 was never the club 's main man for any sustained period he played on longer than any contemporary , helped by his move from the wing to deep midfield in his later years , yet he failed to become @entity7 ’s star man for any sustained period in any single phase of his career			1
there were always more dependable game - changers , the likes of @entity122 , @entity117 , @entity139 and @entity153			1
even @entity154 deployed his more limited attributes as a footballer to more clinical effect as a maker of goals , from the right - side of midfield			0
@entity0 was bizarrely ineffectual in the final third of the pitch , too often crossing in hope , as if happy to waft the responsibility on to others rather than to seize it himself			2
the fact he did not often enough take command of a game is reflected by his failure to win , or come close to winning , the individual @entity14 or world honours that were handed to @entity117 and the young @entity170			2
he failed to move into the class of the truly , global greats			0
( in the spirit of fairness , i should acknowledge that my choice as the @entity16 ’s greatest , @entity24 , did not win the @entity181 either			1
) lengthy : sir @entity182 converted @entity0 from a flying winger to a crafty central midfielder better : both @entity118 ( left ) and @entity120 had a bigger impact on the @entity16 than @entity0 impact : even @entity154 , with a more limited skill - set , was able to score and create more than @entity0 did brilliant : @entity0 scored a superb goal in the @entity190 semi-final against @entity36 but too often he was ineffectual as for @entity0 representing the best traditions of our national game , the verdict here is split			1
he was never sent off in a @entity7 shirt ( though he was once for @entity197 )			2
he withstood the sirens of riches and celebrity			0
but there were black marks against his saintly image : most notably , his long affair with his brother ’s wife , of all people			0
he was a fine player , and even a dazzling one in his mop - haired youth			2
we are just saying , beware the myth .			0

the @entity7 *legend* may be the most decorated player in @entity16 history but his *legacy* has been clouded by sentiment
@entity24 is still the best to grace the league in its 22 - year history
@entity116 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity117 and others can all claim to have had a bigger impact than the @entity224 wizard
@entity0 was never sir @entity182 's star man for any sustained period
