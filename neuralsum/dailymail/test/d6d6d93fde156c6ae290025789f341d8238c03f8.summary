when it comes to yoghurt lids there are typically three types of people : the ' licker ' , the ' spooner ' who scrapes the remaining yoghurt back into the pot , and the ' waster ' who throws it away			0
but a new kind of lid will unite these groups			0
called @entity15 , the technology is inspired by the water - repellent nature of a lotus leaf and uses microscopic bumps to stop liquids from sticking			1
@entity28 maker @entity27 's technology won silver place in the 2013 @entity31 awards for packaging innovation and the firm has teamed up with @entity35 's @entity34 to bring it to consumers maker @entity27 's technology won silver place in the 2013 @entity31 awards for packaging innovation and the @entity28 firm has teamed up with @entity35 's @entity34 to bring it to consumers			1
yoghurts in @entity46 's product line can be opened and the lids peeled off without any liquid left on the surface			0
@entity27 claims that the amount of yoghurt that sticks to lids worldwide is the equivalent to the volume of yoghurt consumed in @entity56			2
the technlogy was inspired by lotus leaves ( pictured ) that repel water to prevent being weighed down by rain , for example			2
in 1977 , @entity28 botanist @entity62 studied the surface of a lotus leaf under a microscope and found that instead of having a smooth surface , the leaf was covered in microscopic bumps these bumps increase the contact angle at which droplets touch the surface , which in turn force the droplets to form into spheres			1
the bumps also create pockets that push air up			0
on a lotus leaf this contact angle is typically 150 degrees , while the @entity15 lid 's creates an angle of 170 degrees ( illustrated ) the inspiration for the lid came from the lotus leaf , hence the name			1

in 1977 , @entity28 botanist @entity62 studied the surface of the leaf under a microscope			0
he discovered that instead of having a smooth , waxy surface , the leaf was covered in microscopic bumps			1
these bumps increase the contact angle at which droplets touch the surface , which in turn force the droplets to form into spheres			1
the bumps also create pockets that push air up			0
as a result , these spheres ca n't fit in between the bumps and roll off the surface			2
on a lotus leaf this contact angle is typically 150 degrees , and the higher the angle the higher the level of repellency			1
this is known as the ' lotus effect ' and has inspired a range of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic materials			0
the @entity15 lid 's surface is based on this principle and creates an angle of 170 degrees			1

' inspired by lotus leaves , @entity15 is an innovative functional packaging material used for yogurt container lids , ' said the firm			1
' the inside sealing surface of the lid offers extremely high water repellency			0
' this material prevents the adhesion of yogurt to the inside surface of the lid allowing it to stay clean and providing an added sanitation benefit , meeting the needs of their consumers			0

technology is being used by yoghurt manufacturer @entity34
it was *designed* by @entity27 and is inspired by lotus leaves
the @entity15 lid 's surface is covered in microscopic bumps
these increases the contact angle for liquids to 170 degrees causing them to form spheres and roll off
