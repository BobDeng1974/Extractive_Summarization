with its mixture of historic medieval towers , elegant @entity5 townhouses and imposing @entity7 structures , it is easy to see why @entity8 is regarded as one of @entity11 's most beautiful cities			0
but one local conservationist is calling for it to be stripped of its @entity15 status due to what he describes as a series of ' architectural blunders '			2
@entity19 , chairman of the city 's @entity20 is horrified by the way his beloved cityscape has changed in recent years and is compiling a damning report criticising planning decisions			1
heritage site : @entity8 was awarded @entity28 status in 1995 , but one local conservationist is so appalled by recent buildings he is compiling a damning report to send to the group 's @entity32 headquarters mr @entity19 intends to send his report to @entity28 's @entity35 next month in a bid to have then strip the city of the heritage status which was awarded in 1995			1
he told the @entity39 : ' at the time [ 1995 ] , @entity8 was seen as a prime example of an old town and new town co-existing well			0
' but since then we have seen one poor planning decision after another , from @entity47 to the @entity49 building and @entity50			0
' this is not just some old fogey talking who does n't like anything modern			0
i like the @entity56 , for example			0
' eyesore : the @entity59 , opened in 2004 , is an imposing structure of steel , oak , and granite another view of the @entity49 which many believe does not fit in well with @entity8 's historic buildings a mixture of old and new buildings along @entity50 which mr @entity19 has criticised as a poor planning decision among the city 's most criticised modern buildings are @entity72 , a 1960s eyesore next to the @entity74 and the new airport expansion recently named ' @entity77 's @entity76 '			2
mr @entity19 said he is concerned at the plans to develop the area around @entity80 and to transform the 190 - year - old @entity82 building into a luxury hotel			0
the city 's @entity28 status is seen as an important draw for tourists and the city council is understandably keen to keep it			1
@entity11 currently has 28 sites on the @entity15 , including @entity91 , the @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 and a section of @entity97 's waterfront			0
if mr @entity19 is successful in convincing @entity28 , it would not be the first time a city has been stripped of it 's @entity101			1
monstrous : @entity72 is a typical example of a 1960s housing block and often cited as one of @entity8 's ugliest buildings @entity107 : the new expansion to @entity8 airport was recently named ' @entity77 's @entity76 ' concerns have been raised over plans to transform the 190 - year - old @entity112 into a luxury hotel in 2009 the @entity114 was taken off the list after a four lane bridge was built just over a mile from the city limits			1
a spokesman for @entity28 said at the time that the city had failed to keep its ' outstanding universal value as inscribed '			1
@entity122 has approached @entity28 for comment regarding @entity8 's status but they are yet to respond .			2
