by @entity1 reporter published : 17:21 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 17:37 est , 7 march 2014 an @entity4 court has heard the voicemails that a former socialite left for her ex-boyfriend after she allegedly hired him to kill her ex-husband so that she could cash out on his $ 2million life insurance policy			1
@entity10 is on trial for the murder of her ex-husband @entity13 who was killed in 1996 after a pipe bomb exploded when he got into his car at a @entity18 country club			1
state prosecutors have accused @entity20 , now 56 , of hiring her ex-boyfriend @entity21 to kill @entity13			1
@entity21 has already been found guilty and is serving two life sentences in jail but jurors were instructed not to consider that during @entity20 ' case			1
her turn : after two weeks of listening to the prosecution , @entity10 ' defense team will be given the chance to explain why they believe she is not guilty for arranging the pipe bomb that killed her ex husband she has pled not guilty to the charges , but the prosecutors ended the first two weeks of the trial by playing recordings that @entity21 secretly taped of their conversations			1
' i wanted to tell you thank you because you 're a great friend ... the other thing is ... is it looks like the money is gone , ' she says in one tape			0
upset : on thursday , the @entity4 court heard recordings that @entity20 ' ex boyfriend @entity21 ( pictured ) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing ' i 'm not able to send you more money , i mean , there 's , you know we need to talk about this			1
' even though @entity20 and @entity13 , a real estate developer , were already divorced at the time of his death , she was still listed as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy so she was awarded $ 2million after the bombing			1
by that time , @entity20 had moved to @entity62 and was indulging in expensive trips so the prosecution alleges that she was not able to keep up with her monthly payments to her reported hit man			2
he became upset and began recording their phone conversations			0
in one recording that the court heard on thursday , he tries to get her to admit her role but she brushes it off			0
' you know what i 'm just aggravated			0
would you just leave me alone ? just leave me alone , ' she is heard saying			0
' am i bothering you ? ' @entity21 responds			2
' right now , you are			0
i 've got ta go i 've got kids down at the pool			0
i 've got company at four - ' ' well you bothered me for some help so you could get rich , so , ' he says			0
' will you leave me alone ? goodbye			0
' at no point in the recordings does she confess to having a role in the bombing			0
her defense team revealed during the opening statements that they plan to show that she did not need to kill her husband because she had little to gain from the death of the father of her two children			0
prosecutors presented a wildly different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and found herself struggling financially with an easy way out			0
scene : the prosecution contends that while @entity20 was not at the @entity18 - area country club when her ex husband @entity13 was killed in 1996 , she paid @entity21 to plant the bomb ' there is one reason that @entity13 was murdered			1
he was murdered because his death benefited @entity10 in a big way - $ 2million is a hell of a motive , ' prosecutor @entity111 said			1
on monday , the trial will turn to her defense team and they are expected to take up to a month - double the amount of time that the prosecution needed - to make their case			2
her attorneys have submitted a list of more than 100 possible witnesses who may be called to testify on her behalf			0
one of those witnesses is @entity130 , the diplomat father of actor @entity131			0
@entity13 was a developer who made millions investing in @entity133 bingo halls and slot - machine parlors in @entity4 and @entity135 before @entity136 authorized tribes to open full - blown casinos			2
but after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests , @entity13 went broke			2
that 's around the time @entity20 filed for divorce , prosecutors say , because @entity13 could no longer support her expensive tastes			1
back in the day : the prosecution has painted @entity20 , seen left in an undated photo , as a gold digger who left her real estate developer husband @entity13 ( right ) after he lost much of his fortune in court : @entity20 was arrested in @entity154 in 2009 and extradited to @entity18			1
her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time ( pictured on february 19 ) ' all of a sudden , the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there , ' @entity160 said			0
she eventually moved to @entity62 and worked in real estate before meeting @entity21			2
the two would soon hatch a plan to kill @entity13 and collect on the policy , @entity160 said			2
' they were talking about it for years , ' @entity160 said			0
@entity21 later left @entity62 while being investigated by police for fraud , and turned up in @entity18 briefly in the summer of 1996			1
' the reason he comes to @entity18 was that he and @entity10 had already agreed to kill @entity13 , ' @entity160 said			1
after the killing , @entity21 was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in @entity178 on fraud charges while @entity20 was sending him money for the hit , eventually adding up to $ 400,000 , @entity160 told jurors			1
the investigation into @entity13 's killing stalled until @entity21 's arrest in 2005			1
authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial transactions with @entity20 , including recorded telephone conversations and invoices			2
police also found divorce records pertaining to @entity20 and @entity13 in a van rented by @entity21			1
that 's when @entity21 and @entity20 became the key suspects			1
she was arrested in @entity154 in 2009 and extradited to @entity18			0
her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time .			0
