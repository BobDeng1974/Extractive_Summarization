by @entity0 gender pay gap : there was controversy when it emerged @entity4 is being paid less than her male predecessor as @entity7 the new leader of the @entity9 last night rejected @entity11 ’s offer to top up her salary using @entity14 cash amid a growing row over her downgraded status in @entity17			1
@entity18 was among several women appointed to senior roles in last week ’s government reshuffle			0
although the overhaul was supposed to promote female mps , it emerged she was due to be paid significantly less than her male predecessor @entity25			0
the discrepancy , which arose because of a legal limit on the number of full @entity17 posts , meant her salary will be £ 78,891 a year , compared with lord @entity25 ’s £ 101,038			2
this was seized on by @entity32 peers , who said it showed ‘ contempt ’ for her role			1
following the row , conservative sources said it had been decided to supplement @entity41 ’s salary using party funds , so she is paid the full @entity17 rate			1
but last night , in a further embarrassment , the @entity45 peer rejected the extra cash , saying she believes her salary should come only from public funds in order to avoid any appearance of potential conflicts of interest			1
in a letter to peers , @entity41 said : ‘ i have decided not to accept this addition to my ministerial salary			2
‘ even though additional pay from @entity14 funds would not break the @entity9 code of conduct for members or the ministerial code , i am a firm believer that when it comes to potential conflicts of interest and especially where money is involved , it is essential that all interested parties feel the right thing is not only done but is also seen to be done			0
‘ i am all too aware that my responsibilities as @entity7 extend beyond the conservative benches to all parts of the @entity74 and to the @entity9 as a whole			0
i feel it only right therefore that my salary comes from a single source and that source should be the public purse consistent with my role as a public servant			0
’ she also insisted that the prime minister had promised to restore the @entity7 to full @entity17 membership ‘ at the earliest opportunity ’			1
@entity41 ’s status was originally downgraded so that outgoing foreign secretary @entity87 can keep full cabinet status as he remains mr @entity11 ’s de facto deputy as @entity45 leader			1
there was embarrassment as @entity93 confirmed that this would mean @entity41 was to be paid less than her predecessor and , for the first time for hundreds of years , the leader of the @entity9 would not be a full member of the @entity17			1
power politics : @entity41 ’s status was originally downgraded so that outgoing foreign secretary @entity87 , right , can keep full cabinet status as he remains de facto deputy to @entity45 leader @entity11 , left @entity100 has begun to erode @entity32 support in key marginal seats that will determine the outcome of next year ’s election			1
the anti-european party would triumph in at least two parliamentary constituencies if voting took place now , according to a poll			0
@entity111 ’s party is in first place in @entity113 in @entity114 and @entity115 in @entity116 , and second in @entity118 , @entity119 , according to the results of a survey of 14,000 people in 14 constituencies			0
the research , carried out for former @entity14 treasurer @entity125 , suggests that after doing serious damage to the @entity45 , @entity100 is a threat to @entity32			2
in may , an @entity125 poll said @entity32 was set to win 82 @entity45 seats – but that has been cut to 53			0
the findings will fuel speculation that mr @entity111 will stand in @entity115 , where @entity45 mp @entity132 is leaving her seat			0
there is now growing pressure on mr @entity87 , who is quitting as an mp at the next election , to accept a downgrade in his status and a pay cut in order to make way for @entity41 ’s position to be enhanced			1
peers from all parties are threatening to back a motion to be tabled by former commons speaker @entity146 condemning the decision to undermine the @entity7 ’s status , which has been seen as an ill - thought - through insult to the second chamber			2
in a letter to leaders of the @entity153 , mr @entity11 said the @entity9 should be ‘ properly represented in the government at the highest level ’ and its leader ‘ as a general rule always be a full member of the @entity17 ’			2
he regarded @entity41 ’s position as ‘ a purely temporary one , which i want to rectify at the earliest opportunity ’			0
he promised : ‘ i will certainly do so immediately after the general election if i am returned as prime minister , if no opportunity has arisen to do so over the coming nine months ’			0
the prime minister insisted @entity41 ‘ will sit at the same place around the @entity17 table , and will have the same full right to speak and contribute to the @entity17 ’s business ’ .			1

@entity41 refused top up from @entity45 *coffers* to avoid ' conflict of interest '
*opposition* peers said downgrade had showed ' contempt ' for her role
her role loses full cabinet membership to make space for @entity87
lords *expected* to back motion condemning downgrade from @entity17
