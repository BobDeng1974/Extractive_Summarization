despite telling teachers she was in a lot of pain , staff did not realise the seriousness of her injury and told her to wash her eye with water			1
@entity9 may never see again in her right eye after the stone - throwing incident in the school playground it took 90 minutes before @entity9 's parents , @entity27 , 46 , and @entity28 , 54 , were notified of their daughter 's injury and her mother immediately came to collect her			1

' it is not believed @entity9 was deliberately targetted in the incident			1
no one was available at the school to comment on the claims			0
