the @entity5 ’s secret cribsheets also reveal how he planned to ‘ relish the chance to show who i am ’			1
and in handwritten notes , mr @entity0 appears to exhort himself to ‘ use the people at home ’			2
embarrassingly for the @entity5 leader , the ten pages of notes were apparently left behind in the @entity15 studios where mr @entity0 clashed with @entity16 , @entity17 and four other party leaders			1

in a further self - motivational message , mr @entity0 , pictured during the debate as @entity44 speaks , also wrote the words ‘ negative ’ and ‘ positive ’ connected by an arrow			2
but the notes also betray the vital importance for the @entity5 leader of landing a blow on the prime minister – and contrasting himself with mr @entity16			2
he wrote ‘ me versus @entity52 ’ , followed by ‘ decency , principle and values ’			1
in a further self - motivational message , mr @entity0 also wrote the words ‘ negative ’ and ‘ positive ’ connected by an arrow			2

they explain why and how @entity0 took on @entity16 over the @entity65 and living standards ' looking down : @entity67 leader @entity0 leaves @entity68 in @entity69 following the televised leaders ' election debate for example , after mr @entity16 reminded the @entity5 leader of his alleged plan to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity65 , mr @entity0 ’s quickfire retort – ‘ i would say to everybody at home : use your vote as a weapon to fight for the future of the health service ’ – was drawn virtually word for word from his notes			1
last night , a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ these notes will come as no surprise			0
