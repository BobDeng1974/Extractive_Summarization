by @entity0 @entity1 has been temporarily banned from killing whats after the @entity2 ruled it is not for scientific purposes as the @entity1 had claimed			1
@entity4 had sued @entity1 at the @entity6 's highest court for resolving disputes between nations in the hope of ending whaling in the @entity11			1
reading a 12 - 4 decision by the court 's 16 - judge panel , presiding judge @entity15 , of @entity16 , said @entity1 's program failed to justify the large number of minke whales it aims to catch under its current @entity22 program - 850 annually			1
all that drew into doubt whether @entity1 's whaling is for scientific purposes , he said			2
' the evidence does not establish that the program 's design and implementation are reasonable in relation to achieving its stated objectives , ' @entity15 said			0
the court ordered @entity1 to halt any issuing of whaling permits until the program has been revamped			1
@entity1 @entity49 spokesman @entity48 told reporters that the country ' regrets and is deeply disappointed ' by the decision			0
but ' as a state that respects the rule of law ... and as a responsible member of the global community , @entity1 will abide by the ruling of the court			0
' @entity60 activist @entity59 on top a harpooned whale as crew members aboard a @entity1 whaling vessel hose him down in the @entity11 the decision is a major victory for @entity4 and environmental groups that oppose whaling on ethical grounds although it will not mean the end of whaling			1
@entity1 has a second , smaller program in the @entity72			1
meanwhile @entity73 and @entity74 reject a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the @entity77 and conduct for - profit whaling			0
nevertheless , environmental groups rejoiced			2
the ruling ' certainly has implications ultimately for whaling by @entity74 and @entity73 as well , ' said @entity83 , director of the @entity85 's whale program , outside the courtroom			0
' i think it will increase pressure on those two countries to re-examine their own whaling practices and the various reasons and pretexts given for that whaling activity			0
' workers on a @entity1 whaling vessel dragging two whales which are tied to the side of their ship in the @entity11 @entity1 had argued that @entity4 's suit was an attempt to force its cultural norms on @entity1 , equivalent to @entity105 demanding an international ban on killing cows			1
though consumption of whale meat has declined in popularity in @entity1 in recent years , it is still considered a delicacy by some			0
@entity1 has pledged to abide by the court 's ruling			0
monday 's ruling found that killing whales for scientific purposes would be justifiable under international law in the context of a better - designed study			0
@entity1 's program was supposed to determine whether commercial whaling of some species can resume without bringing them in danger of extinction			2
the ruling noted among other factors that @entity1 had not considered a smaller program or non-lethal methods to study whale populations			2
in its defense , @entity1 cited only two peer - reviewed scientific papers relating to its program from 2005 to the present - a period during which it has harpooned 3,600 minke whales , a handful of fin whales , and no humpback whales at all .			1
