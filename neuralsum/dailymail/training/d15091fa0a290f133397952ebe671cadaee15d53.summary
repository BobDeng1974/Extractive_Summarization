consumers are ignoring the ' smart ' features of their tv and simply want access to online video services such as the @entity7 's @entity6 , new research has found			1
although manufacturers have given their latest sets the ability to tweet , view websites and even download apps , research firm @entity8 says all consumers really watch to do on their tv is watch tv			1
' the internet connected hdtv screen has so far failed to break beyond the bounds of its tv - centric heritage , with little use for the big screen beyond the obligatory video services , ' said @entity25 , director , @entity26 , @entity27			1
one of @entity29 's flagship smart tvs , which offers apps and access to twitter and @entity34			1
however , research now claims most consumers simply use it to watch tv the research is a major blow for tv manufacturers who have invested millions in creating internet connected sets that can run apps			1
many are set to reveal new models within days at the @entity47 in @entity48 , where gadget makers traditionally unveil their products for the coming year			1
it also comes amid countless rumours and hints that @entity54 is developing its own tv , with ceo @entity56 recently saying the area was one the firm has an ' intense interest ' in			2
' the results are both good and bad news for tv manufacturers , ' says @entity8			2
' on the positive side , the tv itself remains the fundamental screen for tv viewing within the home and is seeing an expanded array of programming through @entity71 services that supplement pay tv subscriptions			0
' the less than great news is that the tv manufacturers are failing to make the tv more than , well , a tv			2
' @entity75 's tv has failed to capture the public 's attention , despite support from manufacturers such as @entity80 the biggest problem , according to @entity8 , is confusion among tv owners			2
' the challenge may be that too much choice is creating a complex user experience , ' it said			0
' it ’s no wonder that most connected consumers are currently stopping short of exploring options beyond video			0
' to counter this , oems and retailers need to focus less on new innovation in this space and more on simplification of the user experience and messaging if they want to drive additional , and new , behaviors on the tv			0
' according to @entity102 , editor of @entity103 , smart tvs are simply too complicated			0
' @entity101 will only become mainstream when they are as easy as changing a channel , ' he told @entity106			0
what smart tv owners are actually doing : watching more tv ' currently it 's just too complex for the majority of people , you need to go through a complex menu system , and then the content is n't always great			1
' the range of content needs to get a lot better			0
' social networks like twitter just does n't make much sense - people will use them on a tablet on their lap rather their tv			0
' for smart tvs to succeed , they have to offer smart content , linking with tablets and other devices			0
' @entity75 and @entity127 have already tried to simplify the experience by bringing together tv service under a single product			0
however , @entity75 's tv efforts have not been a huge success , while @entity127 has chosen to turn its @entity133 into a home hub , claiming that consumers can then simply use the console they already have			2
broadcasters such as @entity138 have also embraced internet tv , offering users access to catchup services through their set top boxes and access to shows via mobile devices			1
however , many in the industry are waiting for @entity54 to show its hand after the dozens of rumours that the @entity150 led project would produce a range of big screen tvs with a revolutionary interface			0
@entity54 already make a £ 99 tv box which allows users to download and watch films , tv shows and music			2
however , it is believed to be working on its own tv set , with @entity150 claiming the firm has ' cracked ' tv before his death last year the @entity54 co-founder , who died in october 2011 , told his biographer , @entity167 , that he had ' cracked ' the problem of television , although @entity167 did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched			1
late last year , ' industry sources ' were quoted as saying that @entity54 would launch 32 - inch and 37 - inch television sets some time this year - and although they are yet to materialise , the latest rumours claim the firm could launch 50 and 55inch models next year .			1

new figures reveal consumers are ignoring the ' smart tv ' features such as apps and twitter access , instead simply watching catch up ' video over the internet
comes as manufacturers set to launch their latest @entity101 in @entity48
@entity54 also believed to be working on tv that could launch in 2013
