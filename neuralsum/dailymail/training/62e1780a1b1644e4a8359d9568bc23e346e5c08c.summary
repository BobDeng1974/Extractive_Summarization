the genetic makeup of @entity2 mysteriously transformed about 4,000 - 5,000 years ago , researchers have discovered			1
an @entity4 team found the unexplained change while analysing several skeletons unearthed in central @entity2 that were up to 7,500 years old			2
they say the rapid expansion of the @entity10 culture , which is believed to have been instrumental in building the monoliths at @entity12 , could hold the key			1
researchers say the rapid expansion of the @entity10 culture , which is believed to have been instrumental in building the monoliths at @entity12 , could hold the key to why the genetic lineage of @entity2 mysteriously transformed about 4000 years ago beaker folk lived about 4,500 years ago in the temperate zones of @entity2 and received their name from their distinctive bell - shaped beakers , decorated in horizontal zones by finely toothed stamps			1
a warlike race , they were primarily bowmen and their extensive search for copper and gold greatly accelerated the spread of bronze metallurgy in @entity2			2
believed top be originally from @entity33 , the @entity10 folk soon spread into central and western @entity2 in their search for metals			1
in central @entity2 they came into contact with the @entity40 culture and gradually intermixed and later spread from central @entity2 to eastern @entity41 , where it may have been responsible for erecting some of the megaliths at @entity12			1
' what is intriguing is that the genetic markers of this first pan-european culture , which was clearly very successful , were then suddenly replaced around 4,500 years ago , and we do n't know why , ' study co-author @entity48 of the @entity49 for @entity50 said			1
' something major happened , and the hunt is now on to find out what that was			0
' ancient dna recovered from a series of skeletons in central @entity57 up to 7500 years old has been used to reconstruct the first detailed genetic history of modern @entity2			2
the study , published today in @entity60 , reveals a dramatic series of events including major migrations from both @entity2 and @entity64 , and signs of an unexplained genetic turnover about 4000 - 5000 years ago			1
the research was performed at the @entity49 's @entity68 for @entity50			0
researchers used dna extracted from bone and teeth samples from prehistoric human skeletons to sequence a group of maternal genetic lineages that are now carried by up to 45 % of @entity76			2
the international team also included the @entity78 in @entity57 and the @entity80 's @entity79			0
' this is the first high - resolution genetic record of these lineages through time , and it is fascinating that we can directly observe both human dna evolving in ' real - time ' , and the dramatic population changes that have taken place in @entity2 , ' says joint lead author dr @entity89 of @entity90 ' we can follow over 4000 years of prehistory , from the earliest farmers through the early @entity93 to modern times			1
' the record of this maternally inherited genetic group , called @entity97 , shows that the first farmers in @entity99 resulted from a wholesale cultural and genetic input via migration , beginning in @entity103 and the @entity104 where farming originated and arriving in @entity57 around 7500 years ago , ' says joint lead author dr @entity106 , formerly at @entity90 and now at the @entity107 , @entity108			1
the team developed new advances in molecular biology to sequence entire mitochondrial genomes from the ancient skeletons			0
beaker folk , lived about 4,500 years ago in the temperate zones of @entity2 and received their name from their distinctive bell - shaped beakers , decorated in horizontal zones by finely toothed stamps this is the first ancient population study using a large number of mitochondrial genomes			1
' we have established that the genetic foundations for modern @entity2 were only established in the @entity125 , after this major genetic transition around 4000 years ago , ' says dr @entity89			1
' this genetic diversity was then modified further by a series of incoming and expanding cultures from @entity131 and @entity132 through the @entity133			0
' the expansion of the @entity10 ( named after their pots ) appears to have been a key event , emerging in @entity131 around 2800 @entity137 and arriving in @entity57 several centuries later , ' says dr @entity106			2
' this is a very interesting group as they have been linked to the expansion of @entity143 languages along the @entity145 coast and into central @entity2			0
' these well - dated ancient genetic sequences provide a unique opportunity to investigate the demographic history of @entity2 , ' says professor @entity48			2
' we can not only estimate population sizes but also accurately determine the evolutionary rate of the sequences , providing a far more accurate timescale of significant events in recent human evolution			0
' the team has been working closely on the genetic prehistory of @entity76 for the past 7 - 8 years			0
professor @entity158 of the @entity78 said : ' this work shows the power of archaeology and ancient dna working together to reconstruct human evolutionary history through time			0
' we are currently expanding this approach to other transects across @entity2			0
' @entity79 director @entity167 says : ' studies such as this on ancient remains serve as a valuable adjunct to the work we are doing with modern populations in the @entity79			0
' while the dna of people alive today can reveal the end result of their ancestors ' ancient movements , to really understand the dynamics of how modern genetic patterns were created we need to study ancient material as well			0
