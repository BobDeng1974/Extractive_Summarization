by @entity0 a widow has been left distraught after the sea view she cherished with her late husband has been blocked by an extension next door			1
@entity6 , 84 , and her husband @entity7 bought the four - bedroom home in @entity9 , @entity10 , 14 years ago to be near the sea			1
before he died last year , mr @entity12 dedicated himself to building a terrace in the garden where they could sit to watch the waves			1
distraught : @entity6 , 84 , once had sprawling views of the @entity10 sea but is now faced with a 15ft wall blocked : this is the start of a brick wall built by the guest house next door that will block mrs @entity6 ' view but now , just months later , the terrace is shrouded in shade cast by a 15ft - high wall , blocking the sight of the shore			1
it is part of works on the @entity34 next door , that will also see first - floor and second - floor balconies erected next to mrs @entity6 ' windows			1
blasting the works , which started in january , the grandmother - of - 12 said : ' my husband built the terrace - he used to love looking out there			1
' we had beautiful views of the sea from both the bedroom and kitchen windows			2
' i used to love looking out during stormy days when the sea was rough			0
now the only way i can see the sea is if i go right to the end of the terrace			2
before : mrs @entity6 and her late husband @entity7 , who died last year , bought the home 14 years ago for its view of the sea			1
@entity7 dedicated himself to building a terrace where they could sit to watch the waves works : mrs @entity6 last year objected to the plans , which were put into action in january ' my husband died last summer and a few months later this happened			1
' this past year has been hell - it ’s not what you expect at the end of your life			2
' mrs @entity6 , who also has four great grandchildren , said she objected to the plans when they were first drawn up months after @entity7 died at the age of 85 of acute myeloid leukemia			1
her neighbour and son - in - law have since written to the council to complain about their handling of the case , but they have had no progress			0
' they started building in january and it ’s still not complete			0
there are builders at the property five days a week making a racket			0
' my husband used to love looking out there			0
we had beautiful views of the sea			0
now i ca n't see anything ' ' when the plans were first up drawn last year we objected twice but @entity92 passed them and we could n’t do anything more			1
' my son - in - law and neighbour wrote to the council a couple of months ago to complain about whether they ’re fit for purpose to pass this type of planning permission as it goes against everything we believe			0
' if we do n’t have any success with them then we ’re going to go to an ombudsman			0
' despite the concerns , @entity107 supported the plans when it met to discuss the application last year			2
but it ordered the guest house to erect ' screening ' between the balconies and mrs @entity6 ' home to maintain her privacy			1
the town authority also requested that the balconies are only used as outdoor seating to keep noise levels to a minimum			0
@entity92 said : ' the occupiers of neighbouring properties were consulted in accordance with council procedure			2
balconies : balconies have also been erected next to mrs @entity6 ' windows in @entity9 , @entity10 ' following receipt of objections from neighbours at numbers 20 and 26 , two site visits were carried out in order to address their concerns			1
' having carefully assessed the proposal , it was concluded that any potential loss of view and light would not be so significant as to warrant a refusal of planning permission			0
' the matter of possible loss of privacy from proposed balconies was addressed by the imposition of a condition requiring privacy screening			2
' potential loss of sea views and devaluation of property are not material planning considerations			0
' the council said it is checking the development is being built in accordance with approved plans and will meet residents on site to explain the development			0
the building ’s owners - @entity164 and @entity165 - did not wish to comment .			0

@entity6 , 84 , bought *seaside* home with late husband for its view
@entity7 , who died last year , dedicated himself to building sea - facing terrace
guest house next door has since built 15ft wall blocking @entity9 beach
plans also feature balconies built next to mrs @entity6 ' windows
@entity92 said it will ensure screening is put up to maintain privacy
