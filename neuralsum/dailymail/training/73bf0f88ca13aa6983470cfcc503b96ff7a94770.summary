by @entity0 published : 20:40 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 20:41 est , 17 march 2013 the other day , my daughter , aged three , came rushing into the living room			2
she was clutching the label from her underwear and was very excited			2
‘ look , @entity6 ! ’ she beamed			2
‘ there ’s a lovely story in my pants ! ’ the ‘ lovely story ’ was , in fact , a four - inch long , flapping label covered in writing			1
you may well have noticed the same thing with an item of clothing you ’ve bought recently			1
made of a man - made fibre , it tends to make you itch , often leaving a red mark on your skin			1
its length means it ’s often visible through the fabric			0
sometimes there are up to four labels joined together			1
the answer , usually , is to cut it off			0
up to scratch : clothes labels are to get longer and wordier the reason for this unwanted piece of material is the fact that many @entity35 clothing firms now sell their products to a large number of countries			1
thus they use the same label — describing the material and washing instructions in up to ten different languages			1
so you will get the word ‘ cotton ’ , for example , translated into @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 etc. that is precisely the case with our daughter ’s underwear			0
@entity57 , where we bought the garment , sells the same product across @entity60			0
if it makes things easier for them , and does not inconvenience customers , who can have any complaint ? but soon it may be impossible to buy a garment without such a label			0
from next year , it ’s likely that almost every item of clothing you buy will contain a label with 23 languages			1
yes , you ’ve guessed it			0
this madness is the brainchild of the @entity76			1
@entity78 number 1007/2011 was quietly passed 18 months ago and is officially due to come into force in 2014			1
to give it its full title , the directive is on ‘ @entity83 and @entity84 and @entity85 ’			1
in typical @entity87 gobbledegook , it states that ‘ the labelling or marking [ of clothes ] shall be provided in the official language or languages of the @entity92 on the territory of which the textile products are made available to the consumer , unless the @entity92 concerned provides otherwise ’			1
official languages : clothing will be labelled in the languages of all @entity76 member @entity92 unless they opt out in plain @entity102 , it means that any product sold in , say , @entity104 must have labels written in @entity106 ; any sold in @entity51 must be in @entity51 ; anything sold in @entity108 must be in @entity108 , and so on			1
although not due to be introduced for several months , the directive is already having an effect on the @entity112 clothing industry			2
@entity113 , chief executive of the clothing industry trade body , the @entity115 , says the result will be that clothing sold in this country will have labels that identify the fibres in 23 languages			1
mr @entity113 says : ‘ if you ’re making 10,000 shirts , it makes no financial sense to keep stopping the production line after every few hundred items to put new labels in			2
’ in any case , at that stage in production , you may well not know whether this particular shirt is destined for @entity133 or @entity134			0
‘ all the companies i have spoken to think this is nuts , ’ says mr @entity113			0
‘ as for customers with smaller garments that fit tightly against the body , a large label is offensive			0
’ @entity141 , the fashion industry newspaper , reports that one wholesaler has been told by retailers that they may not be able to accept deliveries that do not already comply with the regulation			0
for under the rules , it will be the retailer who is legally responsible — and some of the clothing being delivered to shops now might still be on shelves in 2014			2
undoubtedly , the new rule is bound to befuddle many customers when confronted by washing instructions for their new jumper which are written in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity106 and @entity161			0
' silly ' : @entity163 mep @entity162 asks : ' where do you stop ? in covering all the @entity60 languages @entity162 , @entity162 for the @entity167 , says : ‘ frequently , in many of these languages the word is virtually the same			2
but people tend to be terribly defensive about language , and if there ’s a one - letter difference in the spelling , they want to know : “ why is it in your language and not my language ? ” ’ in any case , he asks , will the @entity76 stop at 23 languages ? only 300,000 people speak @entity181 , which is an official language of the @entity76 , while around 10 million speak @entity183 , which is not			1
‘ where do you stop ? ’ asks mr @entity162			0
‘ the whole thing just becomes silly			0
’ the @entity162 first became aware of the issue when he visited a sock factory in his constituency and the owner told him that customers in @entity104 are already saying they would n’t accept any more stock without the new - style labels			1
mr @entity162 says : ‘ they were faced with the dilemma , and cost , of having to take it apart , attach new labels and repackage it			2
’ another firm that imports a well - known brand of shirt from the @entity202 told mr @entity162 that the directive meant it had to take the shirts apart , attach the new multi-language labels and then sew them back together			1
clearly , the problem is widespread			0
when i asked more than half a dozen household - name @entity112 clothes companies about the problem , not one of them wanted to speak publicly about the new rules			2
most declined even to issue an official ‘ no comment ’			0
a spokesman for @entity216 said : ‘ our clothing care labels currently carry advice in 12 languages			1
we ’re now working with our suppliers to assess the implications of the new @entity60 legislation and the actions we need to take			0
’ not surprisingly , much lobbying is going on to try to get the directive repealed , or for a dispensation that will allow the 23 - language labels to be in the form of a peel - off sticker			1
the @entity112 @entity231 has told the @entity232 that it plans to go ahead with stickers unless it hears that they would be unlawful			0
it has not had a reply			0
meanwhile , @entity113 is resigned to the fact that it will soon be almost impossible to sell a woollen jumper without it carrying a label declaring it to be ‘ laine ’ , ‘ wolle ’ , ‘ uld ’ , ‘ villa ’ and so on			0
and we clothes buyers will have to be resigned to more unsightly , long labels and more itches on our skin .			2

almost every item will contain labels in 23 languages
the @entity76 directive will come into force from 2014
lobbying is currently underway to make it into a peel - off sticker instead
