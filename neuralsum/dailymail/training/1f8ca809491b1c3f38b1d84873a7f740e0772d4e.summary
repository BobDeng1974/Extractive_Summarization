between three and four billion years ago , changes in an asteroid belt between @entity2 and @entity3 hurled a devastating barrage of space rocks at our planet			1
astronomers are only now beginning to understand the scale of the bombardment - analysing the impacts from tiny ' spherules ' preserved in rocks today			1
some of the asteroids were bigger than the 9 - mile rock that wiped out the dinosaurs - but the 700 - million - year barrage may have delivered chemicals crucial to the beginnings of life on our planet			2
astronomers are only now beginning to understand the scale of the bombardment - analysing the regularity and size of the impacts from tiny ' spherules ' preserved in rocks today researchers are learning details about asteroid impacts going back to the @entity32 's early history by using a new method for extracting precise information from tiny ' spherules ' embedded in layers of rock ‘ what we have done is provide the foundation for understanding how to interpret the layers in terms of the size and velocity of the asteroid that made them , ’ said @entity37 , professor of earth and atmospheric sciences , physics and aerospace engineering at @entity41			1
' this is the first real solid evidence that this asteroid bombardment actually happened , ’ @entity37 said			2
‘ some of the asteroids that we infer were about 25 miles in diameter , much larger than the one that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago			1
but @entity37 and his team believe that the bombardment may have delivered chemicals crucial to the evolution of life on our planet			0
the study also seems to show that the bombardment lasted far longer than previous estimates , which suggested the ' @entity67 ' lasted roughly half as long as @entity37 's team estimates			1
' but when we looked at the number of impactors as a function of size , we got a curve that showed a lot more small objects than large ones , a pattern that matches exactly the distribution of sizes in the asteroid belt			1
for the first time we have a direct connection between the crater size distribution on the ancient @entity32 and the sizes of asteroids out in space			0
’ @entity37 and his team use ' spherules ' - tiny markings in rocks - to work out the scale of the asteroid bombardment			1
the spherules were created when asteroids crashed into the @entity32 , vaporizing rock that expanded into space as a giant vapor plume			2
small droplets of molten and vaporized rock in the plume condensed and solidified , falling back to @entity32 as a thin layer			0
the round or oblong particles were preserved in layers of rock , and now researchers have analyzed them to record precise information about asteroids impacting @entity32 from 3.5 billion to 35 million years ago			1
the period of heavy asteroid bombardment - from 4.2 to 3.5 billion years ago - is thought to have been influenced by changes in the early solar system that altered the trajectory of objects in an asteroid belt located between @entity2 and @entity3 , sending them on a collision course with @entity32			1
@entity119 in @entity120 : some of the asteroids were bigger than the 9 - mile rock that wiped out the dinosaurs - but the barrage continued for up to 700 million years , as an entire asteroid belt ' emptied ' itself at our @entity128 craters are difficult to study directly , impact history must be inferred either by observations of asteroids that periodically pass near the @entity32 or by studying craters on the moon			1
now , the new technique using spherules offers a far more accurate alternative to chronicle asteroid impacts on @entity32 , @entity37 said			1
‘ we can look at these spherules , see how thick the layer is , how big the spherules are , and we can infer the size and velocity of the asteroid , ’ @entity37 said			1
‘ we can go back to the earliest era in the history of the @entity32 and infer the population of asteroids impacting the planet			0
’ for asteroids larger than about 10 kilometers in diameter , the spherules are deposited in a global layer			2
‘ some of these impacts were several times larger than the @entity157 impact that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , ’ @entity154 said			1
‘ the impacts may have played a large role in the history of life			0
the large number of impacts may have helped simple life by introducing organics and other important materials at a time when life on @entity32 was just taking hold			0
’ a 40 - kilometer asteroid would have wiped out everything on the @entity32 's surface , whereas the one that struck 65 million years ago killed only land animals weighing more than around 20 kilograms			1
‘ impact craters are the most obvious indication of asteroid impacts , but craters on @entity32 are quickly obscured or destroyed by surface weathering and tectonic processes , ’ @entity154 said			2
‘ however , the spherule layers , if preserved in the geologic record , provide information about an impact even when the source crater can not be found			0
’ the @entity41 researchers studied the spherules using computer models that harness mathematical equations developed originally to calculate the condensation of vapor			2
‘ there have been some new wrinkles in vapor condensation modeling that motivated us to do this work , and we were the first to apply it to asteroid impacts , ’ @entity37 said			0
the spherules are about a millimeter in diameter			0
the researchers also are studying a different type of artifact similar to spherules but found only near the original impact site			0
whereas the globally distributed spherules come from the condensing vaporized rock , these ‘ melt droplets ’ are from rock that 's been melted and not completely vaporized			0
‘ before this work , it was not possible to distinguish between these two types of formations , ’ @entity37 said			0
‘ nobody had established criteria for discriminating between them , and we 've done that now			0
’ one of the authors of the @entity223 paper , @entity224 , is now an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at @entity41			0
findings from the research may enable @entity37 's team to enhance an asteroid impact effects calculator he developed to estimate what would happen if asteroids of various sizes were to hit the @entity32			2
the calculator , ‘ impact : @entity32 ! ’ allows anyone to calculate potential comet or asteroid damage based on the object 's mass.			0
