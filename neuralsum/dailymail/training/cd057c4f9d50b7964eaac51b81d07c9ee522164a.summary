by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 12:15 est , 2 january 2014 despite costing thousands of pounds , pectoral implants are becoming increasingly popular among men desperate to boost their upper bodies without hitting the gym			2
but swapping sinew for silicone can have disastrous consequences as 44 - year - old hairdresser , @entity8 , knows only too well			1
four years ago , the @entity9 got implants to boost his confidence after his marriage ended , only to be left in excruciating pain after developing an aggressive infection in one			1
painful : @entity8 was left with a lopsided chest after one of his pec implants became badly infected embarrassing : @entity8 says the experience left him feeling like a freak worse , when the implant was removed , it left him with a disfigured chest that appeared totally lopsided			1
speaking about the havoc wrought on his body , @entity8 , who appears in @entity29 documentary @entity28 , said : ' in a way , it looks like i have two different bodies joined together			2
' there 's no other word than freaky , or feeling like a freak that something 's gone wrong with you			0
what i feel is that it 's holding me back , that i was stupid to have the surgery done in the first place when there was really nothing wrong with my body to start with			0
' in the years since the operation , the hairdresser has been forced to hide his chest in baggy clothing and says his lopsided chest has had a dramatic effect on his confidence			1
' i dreamed of being a bit more buff and had the chest implants for a quick lift to my body and self - esteem , ' he explains			1
' i thought i would feel so good about myself ... that would be the dream come true but it 's not come true			0
' the pain that i experienced with the swelling and the implant was horrific			0
my biggest fear is that i ca n't be helped			0
i just want my symmetry back			0
' according to dr @entity66 , a cosmetic surgeon who specialises in repairing botched surgery , pectoral implants are a particularly risky procedure			1
' the female breast implant is soft , so when it pushes against the tissue , it gives way , ' he explains			2
' a pec implant is solid			2
when it pushes against the tissues , the tissues give way - @entity8 could end up with a moob			2
' assessment : dr @entity66 , an expert in repairing botched operations , assesses the damage to @entity8 's chest warning : leading cosmetic surgeon dr @entity81 says that chest implants are always a bad idea and he 's not the only surgeon to warn of the potentially damaging effects of chest implants			1
dr @entity86 of the @entity87 says that choosing the right doctor is key as badly inserted pec implants can lead to serious consequences			1
' @entity8 's case sounds extremely worrying , ' he says , adding : ' it is very important that you choose a reputable surgeon to gain the desired effect with the right experience			2
' colleague dr @entity81 is also wary of pec implants , which unlike the version created for breasts , are relatively solid - and hard to remove			1
' we strongly discourage our patients to undergo pec implants , the risk of reaction ( capsular contraction ) and dislocation are too high plus those implants do look fake			1
' men with big chests are not seen as particularly trendy and they have difficulties in dressing suits and shirts			0
' if we do need to augment male chest we use submuscular lipofilling ( fat injection ) which it looks rather more natural and it is very safe			0
' there are so many options and all are subject to body proportions and what will benefit the individual best - this is why you need to always talk to an expert where cosmetic surgery is concerned			0
' for @entity8 , there 's no choice and the only option left is to have his second pec implant removed			1
' i 'm looking forward to going to the gym and building up some muscle , ' he adds			0
' hopefully , i 'll one day have a normal looking chest again			0
