by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 06:19 est , 9 august 2012 @entity1 has been accused of being a ‘ front for gambling ’ after it launched a bingo game that allows users to risk thousands to win jackpots in excess of £ 50,000			1
users of @entity10 must stake a minimum of £ 10 on the virtual bingo machine – the site ’s first ‘ real money ’ game – which was launched on the social networking site yesterday			1
it will only be available in the @entity18 , where gaming laws are more relaxed than the @entity20 , and will be followed by a @entity22 - style slot machine app created by the same gaming company			0
@entity24 is the first @entity1 game where players can gamble with real cash , winning up to £ 5,000			1
however , it has come under fire for its cartoon - like logo , which some critic say targets children			2
experts have warned of the dangers of social gaming on @entity1 , which is used by almost two out of three internet - users in the @entity18			2
and because @entity10 features cartoon characters similar to those on the popular children ’s internet hit @entity42 , fresh concerns have been raised that youngsters will be encouraged to play			1
both @entity1 and gambling giant @entity46 , operators of the @entity10 app , insist that its controls will prevent anyone under the age of 18 – the legal age for gambling in the @entity18 – from accessing the real money games			1
a spokesperson for the firms said users must go through strict electoral register and credit card checks before being allowed to play			0
the new site plans to offer a range of bingo and slot machine games using real money but children regularly bypass the minimum age limit to have a @entity1 profile simply by giving false information			1
at present the website is under growing pressure to increase its revenues			0
the company was valued at £ 67billion for its stock market flotation in may but doubts over its money - making potential saw £ 18.2billion vanish from its value in two weeks			0
social gaming and real money gambling are seen as areas where @entity1 can deliver rapid increases in revenue			1
more ‘ real money ’ gambling sites are expected to be launched on the site within months			2
but @entity83 , professor of gambling studies at @entity84 , said : ‘ it is through [ virtual ] gambling that children are introduced to the principles and excitement of gambling			2
’ he visited @entity10 yesterday and said he was struck by the characters which appeared to target young people			2
professor @entity83 said : ‘ i had extreme concerns about the graphics and imagery			0
like : @entity1 hopes the gambling firms will help it make money ‘ the whole thing about gambling is that it should not appeal to children or adolescents in any way			1
how that squares with the idea of not promoting gambling for children and adolescents , i ’ve no idea at all			0
‘ they ’re effectively a front for a gambling operator			0
’ when registering to @entity10 users can make a ‘ quick deposit ’ from their debit or credit card of £ 10 up to £ 500			0
users are also offered the chance to deposit an amount up to the value of £ 20,000			0
when a @entity121 reporter registered on the site with a £ 10 stake , he was immediately offered the chance of a bingo jackpot in excess of £ 5,000 and a slot machine jackpot of over £ 52,000			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ real money gaming is a popular and well - regulated activity in the @entity18 and we are allowing a partner to offer their games to adult users on the @entity1 platform in a safe and controlled manner			1
