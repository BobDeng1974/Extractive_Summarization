@entity0 were much the better side in the first half but squandered numerous opportunities which allowed their opponents to undeservedly lead 12 - 10 at the interval			1

@entity21 scored @entity0 's try with @entity23 kicking two penalties and a conversion			1
@entity4 winger @entity15 pulls @entity0 's @entity26 up short of the line @entity28 brings the ball forward for much - improved @entity0 but they trailed 12 - 0 at the break @entity0 were without their captain , @entity31 , who was suspended after being sent off last week			1

@entity26 chased a kick ahead to collect and looked a certain try - scorer until @entity15 dashed back to prevent the wing from grounding the ball			0
@entity14 crosses for @entity4 first try of four in the match at @entity69 in @entity70 moments later the hosts had another great opportunity but @entity28 was unable to gather a clever cross field kick from @entity74 , when there were no @entity4 defenders to challenge @entity28			0
the opening period was played at a frenetic pace as both teams tried to run the ball at every opportunity with @entity0 again having a great chance to open the scoring			0
on half - way , @entity84 intercepted a careless pass from @entity87 to race away but he did not have the legs to make it to the line as he was hauled down 15 metres short			0
quins had their first chance , which they look to have taken when @entity15 collected @entity19 's kicked to step inside a defender and touch down but the wing had put a foot in touch so the game , despite plenty of entertainment was scoreless at the end of the first quarter			1
@entity102 kicks the ball clear from the ruck as a much - improved @entity0 fall to @entity4 after 21 minutes , @entity0 deservedly opened the scoring with a superb try			2
@entity23 carved the visitors ' defence apart to send @entity26 away , with the wing running elusively to send @entity21 in under the posts for the try which @entity23 converted			1
they declined a number of kickable penalties in favour of more attacking options and were rewarded when an alert @entity14 caught the home side napping to dart over for the try which @entity19 was unable to convert			2
the home side suffered a further blow when hooker @entity122 was carried off on a stretcher with a leg injury to be replaced by @entity125			0
@entity4 also lost a player through injury with @entity128 departing before a @entity23 penalty extended the @entity0 lead			2

@entity23 could have put @entity0 back in front but missed a penalty but the home side remained the better side in the opening exchanges of the second half			2
it was therefore against the run of play when @entity4 score their third try when @entity15 brushed aside some weak tackling to provide @entity16 with an easy run - in			1
@entity23 kicked a penalty before @entity4 introduced @entity46 , who ensured his team dominated the final 15 minutes and it was his long pass which created the bonus point try for @entity17			1
