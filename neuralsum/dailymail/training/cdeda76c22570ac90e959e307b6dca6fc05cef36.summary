it was penned on 26 june 1943 - just five weeks after he led @entity10 's daring mission using the revolutionary bouncing bomb			1
thought to be his only letter ever sold , it is expected to fetch £ 3,000 at auction next month			1
he was replying to fellow pilot flight - lieutenant @entity17 who had written to congratulate him on the raid and on his subsequent @entity20			2
rare : national hero @entity2 was replying to fellow pilot flight - lieutenant @entity17 who had written to congratulate him on the raid and on his subsequent @entity20 @entity2 says : ' life in @entity26 is much the same with everyone very optimistic			1
the @entity28 certainly is getting the biggest bashing of its life			2
how anyone can stick - i just do n't know			2
' one of the most celebrated figures of the @entity35 , he masterminded @entity36 - the raid on the dams of the @entity38 on 16 and 17 may 1943 - which has achieved legendary status			2
he was in command of @entity10 - 19 aircraft that set out to destroy the @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity37 in the @entity38 so as to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial heart of @entity47			1
@entity49 ace : @entity2 was just 26 when he was killed in 1944 after his plane was downed by friendly fire the first two were attacked and breached by mines dropped from specially modified @entity53 using bouncing bombs and the @entity55 was also damaged			1
the daring night - time raid was hailed a success			2
at the time @entity2 wrote the letter he was still in command of the squadron which had been put together specifically to carry out the raids and was based at @entity62 in @entity63			1
writing in the style of the day @entity2 - who was killed a year later after his plane was downed by friendly fire in a night - time sortie over germany - gossips about old times			1
he said : ' i 'm afraid @entity62 is not the same gay place it used to be			0
i must say g / c @entity73 ( group captain @entity74 ) was a wizard for parties			0
so old @entity78 is out eh ? i hope someone married her ! ' the letter starts rather affectionately ' @entity81 ' and goes on to say how nice it is to hear from him again			2
although close chums , at the end he signs it off very formally ' @entity87 '			0
@entity89 spokesman @entity88 said : ' some of the language is quite old - fashioned and have a different context to today - when he talks about ' how anyone can stick ' after the @entity3 raids means he does n't know how the @entity47 can ' put up with ' living there			1
' one way of looking at it would be he could have had a little sympathy for those who were on the end of it			0
' @entity62 not being as ' gay ' as it once was means it was no longer as much fun - this was a common expression in those days			0
' but we have no idea who @entity78 was - she has been lost in the mists of time			0
' mr @entity88 said the letter - which is being sold anonymously by its owner - will be of interest to private collectors and institutions			1

' @entity2 had spent his boyhood in @entity117 and passed on some tips			1
he said : ' i 'm sure you must love @entity117 ! it 's not a bad place - now when i was in @entity142 - i used to make regular trips to catch prawns in the @entity145 ! ( sic ) ' then referring to the @entity147 invaders he said : ' you must try the same when the @entity148 clear out			2
' the two - page letter is in good condition with only very light dust - staining and spotting			2

he was posted to @entity117 in early 1943 and ended the war as @entity154 at @entity155 @entity49 , @entity156			0
@entity2 's @entity158 exploits were an important boost to national morale and he was considered too valuable to risk in further combat			1
having accompanied @entity162 to @entity163 and subsequently served as a staff officer he eventually persuaded a reluctant ' @entity165 to allow him to return to the air			0
heroes : @entity168 in the @entity35			0

his celebrated memoir , @entity194 , was posthumously published in 1946 and filmed as @entity195 in 1955			0
@entity3 hero with his devoted dog and fellow pilots tending their beloved garden mr @entity88 said : ' this is the only autograph letter by him of which we can find record that has appeared for sale			2
' it 's uncertain when he and @entity121 first met but as the letter makes clear they overlapped at @entity62 where @entity2 was stationed as chief @entity207 between december 1941 and april 1942			1
mr @entity88 said : ' family tradition holds he served as @entity2 's best man in 1940 but neither we - nor they - have been able to verify this			1
' he is however mentioned in @entity194 as having flown @entity2 ' to the north of @entity26 ' in march 1942			1

he took control of the mission with no idea what was to come			0
unusually , the 24 - year - old was given the authority to pick his own team			0

the success of the @entity3 made @entity2 the most highly decorated pilot in the @entity49 and gave him a place in history			1
he was awarded the @entity20 - the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to @entity246 and @entity247 forces			0
usually , former commanders moved on to senior office - based roles to see out the rest of the war after a successful raid			0
@entity255 leaders and politicians encouraged him to do so - if he was captured or killed it would have seriously damaged @entity246 moral			0
but @entity2 insisted on operational duty			1
he was initially posted at a @entity260 bomber base at @entity261 on a strictly non-operational basis			0
however , after persistent pestering from @entity2 , they decided to let him lead a bomber squadron into @entity47			1

part of his remains were later found			0

sir @entity287 , who invented the bouncing bomb , described @entity2 , saying : ' for some men of great courage and adventure , inactivity was a slow death			2
would a man like @entity2 ever have adjusted back to peacetime life ? ' one can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through			2
facing death had become his drug			0
' he had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade			0
' perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their @entity306			0
' he had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it			0
' but that was the kind of man he was … a man of great courage , inspiration and leadership			0
a man born for war … but born to fall in war			0
