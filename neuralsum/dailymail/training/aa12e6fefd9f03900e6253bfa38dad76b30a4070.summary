incredible : the hot spring in @entity4 's @entity23 which is part of a series of pictures taken from up to 9,000ft in the air and the beautiful results reveal the drastically contrasting landscapes of @entity4 - from explosive volcanoes to @entity31 ’s largest icecap			1
in one photograph , a fork of sideways lightening sparks out from the @entity36 volcano - which caused travel chaos when it erupted in 2010 - as it explodes into action			1
another shot appears to show a tree , but is actually a river delta running into several different streams			0
@entity9 , from @entity43 in @entity44 , who wed @entity6 in 2005 before embarking on the epic photography project , said : ' normally i get sick when flying , so i was thankful for the calm conditions , otherwise i would have been in trouble			2
spectacle : lightning flashes through an ash cloud from the @entity53 volcano in @entity4 dramatic : a meandering river crosses the grey sandy beach of @entity57 in @entity4 rugged : this aerial view of the the @entity59 in @entity4 reveals another of the country 's drastically contrasting landscapes ' we had been forced to wait for two months for a day that was n’t cloudy or raining			1
so when we woke up and it was sunny we knew we had to get in the air as quick as possible before it changed			2
' but it was definitely worth being patient			0
@entity4 ’s landscape is so extreme and varied - it makes for such amazing viewing			2
the colours of the flat landscape really only become visible once you are in the air			0

time lapse : a flock of red knot birds feed on coastal rocks while being washed by waves in @entity86 peninsula , @entity4 splash : this boiling mud pot was captured on camera in @entity90 in @entity4 atmospheric : this picture shows a hot spring with an unusual cloud formation above it in @entity95 , @entity4 @entity6 used an open window to capture clear shots of the world below as the plane banked to the left , allowing him to look straight down			1
incredibly , thanks to the poor weather , they covered the whole nation in just one five - hour flight before being forced to return as the fuel ran low			1
professional snapper @entity9 , who quit her studies to become a full - time photographer , added : ' it was a tight schedule			0
one minute we were photographing the erupting @entity53 volcano and the next we were over @entity31 ’s largest ice cap , the @entity114			1
' most tourists never get to see these places at all - let alone from the air			2
we feel privileged to have witnessed them first hand			0
@entity120 : an aerial view showing small streams flowing at the @entity124 kull glacier in @entity4 ' we always try and show @entity4 in a totally different light to the one the tourists often experience			0
that ’s why we decided to focus on all the extremes and contrasts the country had to offer			0
' people seem to be amazed by the abstract aerials , probably because they are almost alien - like			0
