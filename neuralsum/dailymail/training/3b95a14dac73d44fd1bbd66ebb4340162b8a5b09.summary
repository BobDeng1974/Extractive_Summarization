the @entity6 says that the problem of ' drive - offs ' is reaching ' epidemic levels ' , and says ministers must do something to help petrol stations , rather than leaving it to the police to deal with			1
the @entity15 also says that the problem has recently intensified , and says two groups of people are responsible : those who simply can not afford to pay rising petrol prices , and organised gangs who steal fuel on a large scale			2
' retailers can do as much as they can - write down number plates , install @entity38 - but the police are saying that before they enter it into their records as a criminal offence we have got to prove evidence of criminal intent by the motorist			0
' that 's near impossible			0
' last week a forecourt manager in @entity49 was critically injured after trying to stop people driving away from his petrol station without paying			0
@entity53 , 58 , was hurt while trying to write down the numberplate of a car driven by suspected fuel thieves at the @entity58 garage he manages in @entity60 , @entity49			2
his son said the car drove into him , leaving mr @entity53 clinging on to the wipers for 200 yards before he was thrown from the speeding car onto the side of the road			0
last week a 19 - year - old man and a 16 - year - old girl were arrested in @entity69 , @entity49 , on suspicion of attempted murder			0
@entity53 , 58 , was critically injured when trying to stop petrol thieves at his @entity49 garage the suspected petrol thieves had targeted this @entity58 garage in @entity60 , @entity49 a spokesman for the @entity15 told @entity75 : ' we have always seen drive - offs over many years but now the scale of them has intensified			1
' there are two types of people involved : desperate people who are finding the cost of fuel too great and have to resort to desperate measures to stay mobile , and organised crime gangs who steal anything that is expensive , like fuel			2
' he said the latter type tended not to steal petrol because it was too volatile to handle , but would steal diesel , either by filling drums inside a van or even by using small tankers			0
' earlier this year there was a spate of fuel thefts and we are not talking hundreds of litres , we are talking thousands of litres			1
' going up : fuel prices have soared in the last few years , making it an attractive target for thieves the @entity15 spokesman said that petrol station managers did use numberplate recognition , cctv cameras , and spoke to each other about which vehicles to look out for , but said none of this was any use if thieves used stolen numberplates to cover their own			1
recently gangs have gone to petrol stations when they were closed and prised fuel reservoirs open before helping themselves			0
