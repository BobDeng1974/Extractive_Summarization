by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 27 may 2012 @entity1 is so well known for ruffling feathers that he virtually makes a living out of it			2
but it seems the @entity7 presenter is running out of human victims – and is now making enemies in the world of birds			0
after he appeared on @entity15 ’s nature - watching programme @entity16 last sunday , to an audience of 6.8million , a police wildlife officer reported him for allegedly interfering with barn owls			1
probe : the @entity16 episode followed @entity20 and @entity1 as the pair discussed barn owls at his @entity24 home spotted : a barn owl flew from the barn in the farm building of @entity1 's home as the duo approached according to @entity31 , a scene in which @entity1 and @entity16 presenter @entity20 approached the owls ’ nesting box appeared to be in breach of the @entity36 – and irresponsibly encouraged millions of viewers to commit a similar offence			1
@entity39 first took to @entity40 with his claim that the pair should have got a licence for filming and disturbing the nest , then contacted the @entity15			1
he went on to tell the government agency @entity45 , along with the @entity46 and the @entity47			0
and @entity49 police yesterday confirmed they were ‘ investigating a report of a reckless disturbance of birds ’			1
the alleged offence carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail			0
a @entity15 spokesman insisted that @entity57 had behaved correctly			1
but research of @entity1 ’s history suggests he might have form in the barn owl molestation department			2
ten years ago he apologised on @entity7 for ‘ joking ’ that he would kick one of the birds to death for fun			0
an owl flies away on the show			0
@entity69 @entity31 took to @entity40 with his claim that the pair should have got a licence for filming and disturbing the nest @entity1 and @entity20 on the @entity15 show			1
@entity49 police yesterday confirmed they were ' investigating a report of a reckless disturbance of birds ' police are looking into a viewer complaint that @entity16 disturbed the barn owls , which are protected under special @entity80 licences and three years ago he boasted that by hooting his @entity83 ’s horn he managed to ‘ scare a family of barn owls you would normally need a night vision lens and a night without sleep to see ’			1
his latest brush with birdlife came when he welcomed @entity91 to the @entity24 farm he bought in 2009.as he showed the @entity16 presenter around the farm , as part of a programme to promote a nature photography competition , he led him to a nesting box in a derelict building and showed him some of the food pellets ejected by owls			1
‘ i want to get more butterflies and many many many more birds , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ i ’ve got some owl boxes that might have barn owls in them			1
’ as they drew close to the box , two of the magnificent birds were apparently startled into emerging and flying off			0
minutes after the programme was aired , @entity113 and @entity114 wildlife and countryside officer @entity39 tweeted : ‘ did @entity1 and @entity91 have the appropriate licence to approach that barn owl nest on @entity16 tonight ? ? ’ he added : ‘ irresponsible to show that behaviour without warning people watching that you need appropriate licences , without is an offence			2
’ online on his personal blog , @entity39 , a keen birdwatcher and former soldier currently spending his holiday thwarting songbird trappers in @entity128 , added : ‘ @entity1 , @entity20 and the film crew knowingly approached a barn owl nest site causing the birds to leave the nest			2
they stayed around and filmed the site			0
’ the @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ @entity16 took expert advice before approaching the barn and we do not believe there was a breach of wildlife law			1
no one from the team entered the barn while the birds were there or approached the nest directly			2
@entity16 would never knowingly do anything that has a detrimental impact on wildlife			0
‘ viewers are encouraged to take their photos responsibly and there is guidance about how to do that on the programme website			0
’ @entity20 – who is president of the @entity156 – said : ‘ i ’ve been doing this kind of work for years and i ’m confident there was no disturbance of the barn owls			1
’ surprisingly , @entity39 himself had managed to cause offence when he briefly appeared on @entity16 the previous week			0
he seemed to suggest pigeon fanciers were responsible for the persecution of peregrine falcons , although he later blamed the way the programme was edited			0
the @entity7 presenter 's sprawling @entity24 home was the setting on sunday night for the @entity57 programme			2

disturbing nesting barn owls against special licences laid down by @entity80
police confirm they *'re* investigating allegations of ' reckless bird disturbance '
@entity15 said @entity57 behaved ' correctly ' but could a heavy fine if *prosecuted*
