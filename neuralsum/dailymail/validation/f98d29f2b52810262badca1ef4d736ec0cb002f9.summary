there was something unwholesome about the way @entity4 ’ romance with @entity5 ended			1
perhaps breaking such a bond required a greater explanation , hence the story on the club ’s website last summer that was really quite damning and unique in its detail			0
the post read : ‘ despite glowing starts to each campaign , @entity4 ’s contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close			1
‘ from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season			1
he only scored one , six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season			1
@entity4 ( left ) has a history of going quiet during the second half of the season in terms of goals ‘ for some reason , he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first			1
’ to apply some context , such statements usually run to a confirmation that a player has left			0
if a club is feeling particularly venomous , it might omit the part where a player is thanked for his contribution			0
maybe the close relationship with @entity4 , the prodigal son who returned and then left for again , meant they felt compelled to explain the step of letting him join @entity50 for £ 30million			1
the talented playmaker had a blistering start to the season and has racked up 15 assists despite his slump but whatever the motive , there was a deep and intriguing point in the message			1
@entity5 had spotted a real trend and the rational among @entity50 ’s fans are probably starting to see it			1
that ’s not to overreact and criticise a player who has arguably had the greatest impact on @entity50 ’s title push			2
@entity4 has been magnificent , a deep - lying playmaker ( usually ) who has the engine to roam , the sense to dictate tempo and the guile to create			2
first half v second half of the season 09 - 10 : 19 v 9 10 - 11 : 9 v 5 11 - 12 : 13 v 4 13 - 14 : 16 v 5 14 - 15 : 15 v 2 his number of assists is astonishing – 15 in the @entity75 , which is seven more than his next domestic rival			2
alongside @entity78 , @entity50 have a legitimately world - class midfield platform			2
but on wednesday night @entity4 looked flat			2
a subjective view , certainly , but the numbers are showing the return of a curious pattern			0
he has neither scored nor assisted in his past nine games in all competitions , seven of which were starts			2
his last assist was against @entity89 on january 17			0
his previous longest run without a goal or assist this season was two			1
the former @entity5 man suffered the fate at @entity5 during his time there before he was sold to @entity50 that is not to say he is playing badly in this spell			2
he was poor when he came on against @entity99 in the @entity100 and was off the pace in the league game against @entity103 , but generally has been among @entity50 ’s best performers			0
and yet the incision is not what it was			0
looking at league figures alone , he managed 15 goals or assists in the first half of the season and has so far scored or created only two in the second half			1
it is a trend that goes back all the way to the 2009 - 10 season , @entity4 ’s penultimate campaign at @entity115 , when his respective figures were 19 and nine			1
in 2010 - 11 they were nine and five and in 2011 - 12 , his first back at @entity5 , he scored or created 13 in the first half of the season and four on the stretch			0
@entity4 clashes with @entity123 during a night of frustration in the @entity125 in @entity126 last season , it was even more pronounced – 16 going out and five coming back in			1
it is a mystery , not least because it would be unfair to conclude he is in poor form			0
but he is less incisive , regardless of whether it is for individual or team reasons			0
certainly , his role within the side has tended to change at times recently , with @entity136 occasionally switching between 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 3 - 3			0
and there has also been a more restrained manner in how the team is playing , perhaps because there is a greater emphasis on protecting what they have in the league rather chasing a bigger advantage			0
in any case , the numbers make interesting reading for the player			0
he certainly wo n’t thank @entity5 for flagging it up			0
the @entity152 international is setting a trend and began to show signs of flagging during his time at @entity115			1

@entity4 has previously seen his form slump during the season
the @entity152 international has scored and assisted two goals in the second part of the campaign compared to his *impressive* 15 at the beginning
@entity4 has *n't* been involved in a goal in the previous nine matches
the @entity50 star still leads the assist table and is seven ahead of next best
