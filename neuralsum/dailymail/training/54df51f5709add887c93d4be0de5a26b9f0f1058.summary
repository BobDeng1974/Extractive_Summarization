and he directly criticised the prime minister ’s @entity38 pledge to defend the @entity5			0
he said : ‘ as a corollary to a year in which the @entity40 issued threats to several independent countries , to such an extent that the @entity0 @entity46 itself had to reject its attempts to launch military actions in the @entity49 , the @entity40 devoted a paragraph of its @entity38 address to the military defence of the @entity5 , forgetting – if the @entity0 government was ever able to appreciate it – the peace message that @entity38 should inspire			2
‘ perhaps this was the expression of a failed attempt to confuse the world as to the colonial and military occupation of @entity2 territory , and the result of the lack of legal and historical arguments			1
