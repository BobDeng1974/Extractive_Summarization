jihadi @entity0 was known to @entity1 before he travelled to @entity2 to join the barbaric @entity3			1
security officials have now identified the @entity5 who played a key role in the murder videos of @entity10 aid worker @entity9 and two @entity12 journalists			1
but his name and background are being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions			1
they believe covert operations are the best way to find out where in @entity2 the militant is based			1
crucially , he is believed to be close to where the is group is holding some of its international hostages , including 47 - year - old taxi driver @entity49 , from @entity50			0
@entity0 threatened the father - of - two with beheading at the end of the video in which mr @entity9 , 44 , was seen before and after his murder			1
despite the huge numbers that have watched the gruesome propaganda videos , @entity0 has yet to be named publicly			1
@entity57 – a @entity58 rapper initially identified as a suspect – has been ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms			0
the 23 - year - old , whose father is awaiting trial in the @entity12 on terror charges linked to embassy bombings in @entity69 , came to prominence earlier this year after he posted a photograph of himself on @entity72 holding up a severed head			2
‘ @entity75 ’ with my homie or what ’s left of him , ’ he wrote on his @entity72 account , which has since been deactivated			0
a shortlist of potential identities for @entity0 was drawn up soon after the first video appeared of him executing @entity12 journalist @entity85 - and authorities are now said to have a suspect other britons from @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 have been linked to @entity0 , who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for @entity95 and @entity96 captives freed in return for ransoms			1
it is claimed he was making street collections for genuine @entity102 charities based in @entity58 at the time he came to @entity1 ’s attention			2
anti-terror investigators looking at the support networks of fighters in @entity2 have often focused on charities			2
officials have repeatedly stressed that having somebody on their radar is not the same as placing them under surveillance			0
in the case of @entity0 , he is understood to have become radicalised almost overnight and left @entity10 more than a year ago , where he quickly became a hardened fighter			1
there is no suggestion that @entity1 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad			2
@entity10 and @entity12 signals specialists in @entity123 and the @entity125 city of @entity126 have been working with @entity127 to pinpoint where he is now			1
@entity130 fitted with sophisticated equipment , which can eavesdrop on conversations taking place tens of thousands of feet below , are listening to see if they can pick up a voice match			0
all three murder videos have been broken down piece by piece and studied to provide clues on where they were filmed			0
security experts believe the black - robed killer ranting on the video is @entity10 , rather than that a @entity10 voice has been dubbed over the footage			2
the jihadist wears a black mask , concealing all but his eyes , making it difficult to be sure the voice belonged to him			0
but audio experts say they are ‘ 99 per cent ’ certain the words were spoken by the man seen on camera			0
linguistic experts believe the way he pronounced certain words , such as @entity161 place names , suggest he has a foreign language background – indicating his parents or grandparents may have come from the @entity165			0
foreign secretary @entity166 called a emergency cobra meeting soon after the latest video emerged so defence and security chiefs could plan their response he appears to have a skin tone consistent with someone of @entity174 , @entity165 or @entity176 descent			0
it is not believed that @entity0 or the hostages are far from the northern @entity2 city of @entity29 where @entity32 has established its headquarters			1
the city has a warren of underground tunnels where hostages are believed to have been held			0
spy planes revealed that @entity12 hostage @entity85 was executed near the @entity187 in the city			2
jihadi @entity0 is among some 500 @entity10 who have travelled to @entity2 – and now @entity161 – with around 250 returning , 200 of them to the @entity58 area			1
in a speech to the @entity194 at @entity195 last night , @entity192 said the government was seeking new powers to remove the passports from extremists			0
she described the murder of @entity9 as ‘ an absolutely barbaric act ’ , adding : ‘ our message has to be clear			0
the @entity10 , like the @entity12 , will not allow these grotesque acts to stop us from keeping our homelands secure and stopping the march of this brutal ideology			1

jihadi @entity0 was known to @entity1 before he went to @entity2 to join @entity3
his name and background are being kept a secret to *protect* hostages
they have put off any move on @entity10 network while hostages remain captive
drones are meanwhile being *flown* over @entity2 to locate his hideout
@entity12 authorities will order strike as soon as his *location* is confirmed
