for a deadline day which ranked as relatively low key in comparison to previous transfer windows , it still managed to throw up all manner of questions and puzzlers			0
here , @entity9 attempts to answer some of the complexities which emerged and managed to bamboozle us all amid the lack of transfer activity ... right , let ’s start with the ‘ deadline ’ itself – when is it ? it is still 11pm			1
domestic transfers , however , can be granted an extension until 1am , and international transfers until midnight			2
so if you realise at 11.30pm you need a new striker then you can get on the phone ? @entity26 boss @entity25 managed to sign @entity27 but was unable to bring in @entity28 no – a ‘ deal sheet ’ must be submitted to the @entity29 before 11pm			1
so , in effect , that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen			2
if the @entity29 has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork			1
@entity42 completed his big - money move to @entity44 from @entity45 on the transfer deadline day what is a ‘ deal sheet ’ ? it is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm			1
after that documents such as the contract , the transfer agreement and permission to work in the @entity54 must be submitted			2
@entity55 submitted a deal sheet in the case of @entity58 , who they signed from @entity60 but only confirmed at midnight			1
@entity61 ( left ) signed for @entity55 from @entity60 but the @entity62 needed the use of a deal sheet this one is a bit of a head - scratcher - how many clubs can a player represent in one season ? @entity72 rules state that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs but can only play for two of those			1
@entity78 is the most high - profile example of a player who has fallen foul of this			2
he signed for @entity83 after being released from his contract at @entity85 but @entity72 intervened and prevented him from playing for the @entity87 club			1
why ? well , he had already appeared for @entity55 during a season - long stay – which was terminated in january – and for @entity85 ’s under - 21s , which is classed as an official fixture by @entity72			2
therefore , he was free to sign for @entity83 but not eligible to play			0
@entity78 signed for @entity83 from @entity85 but was banned because he was registered with three clubs is there a way around this for @entity78 ? yes			1
he could move to the @entity95 because their 2015 season starts in march and @entity72 makes allowances for campaigns in different countries overlapping			0
why then has @entity100 signed for @entity101 after playing for @entity55 and @entity102 already this season ? in @entity105 we have the term ‘ emergency loan ’ which is classified as anything up to 93 days and is not subject to the above rules			1
for the record , ‘ emergency loan ’ is a @entity112 term and not one which is particularly endorsed by the @entity29			0
anyway , @entity100 ’s loan stay at @entity102 was a short - term deal and that is why he is free to sign for @entity101 until the end of the season			0
it also why , for example , @entity120 was able to play for @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 last season			0
@entity100 was able to sign for @entity101 because he only joined @entity102 on an ' emergency loan ' @entity85 have sent five players on loan to @entity129 ! how ? in @entity131 ( and the @entity112 ) you are allowed to loan a maximum of two players from one club			0
however , under @entity137 rules , there is no restriction on cross-border loans , hence @entity129 being able to bring in five @entity85 players in one hit			0
as for the dual interest of @entity85 owner @entity143 and his 8.9 per cent stake in @entity129 , well that raises questions for another topic entirely			0
@entity147 was one of five players who @entity129 loaned fom @entity85 what happened with @entity150 and @entity151 ? @entity150 signed for @entity152 on loan earlier this month from @entity154			0
@entity29 rules state you can only loan one player from another top - flight club			1
@entity152 then decided that they did n’t need @entity150 and instead wanted @entity151 from @entity154			0
no problem , they thought , swap @entity161 for @entity151			0
however , @entity29 rules also state that a player can not return to his parent club in the same transfer window in which he has left			1
the deal , therefore , collapsed and @entity150 remained at @entity152 , @entity151 at @entity154			0
@entity167 tried to swap the loan deals of @entity154 's @entity150 and @entity151 but was denied finally , what happened with @entity170 ? for now he remains 100 per cent a @entity172 player			2
a pre-contract agreement with @entity174 ( which he was eligible to sign with a foreign club because his contract expires in the summer ) never materialised			0
there was also a suggestion that he could sign for @entity181 and be loaned back immediately to the @entity172			0
however , @entity29 rule v.7.1 states , ‘ a temporary transfer to a club may not take place in the transfer window in which the transferor club acquired the player ’s registration ’			1
note that this does not apply to deals between @entity29 and @entity112 clubs , hence @entity193 were able to loan back @entity194 to @entity195			2
but @entity170 could still sign what is known as a @entity198 agreement with @entity181 , which allows contract rights to be passed over at a future date and can be signed outside of the transfer window			1
also , because @entity170 is under 23 and out of contract in june , a tribunal will set the compensation fee paid to @entity172 unless the two clubs can reach an agreement			2
@entity181 wanted to buy @entity170 and loan him back to @entity172 but @entity207 @entity206 did n't allow it			1

@entity9 tries to *explain* the complexities involving the transfer window
@entity170 ' @entity181 move was *blocked* by @entity29 rules
@entity78 's move to @entity83 has turned into a *nightmare* after he was banned from playing after already being registered with three clubs
@entity61 was able to complete his @entity55 move after they submitted a ' deal sheet ' and were granted an extension
