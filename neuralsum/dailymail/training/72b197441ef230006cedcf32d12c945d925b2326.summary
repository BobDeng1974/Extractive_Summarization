a mother is to sue the government after her son developed narcolepsy when he received a swine flu jab causing him to sleep for 19 hours a day			2
seven - year - old @entity5 developed the condition within three weeks of receiving the drug and now suffers ' attacks ' which can cause him to doze through the day			1
he would fall asleep up to every five minutes - even when he was walking , eating and swimming - and suffered sudden seizures when he laughs			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , with her seven - year - old son @entity5 who contracted narcolepsy in reaction to receiving the swine flu vaccine now his mother @entity10 , 42 , is taking legal action after the @entity19 found there was a ten-fold increased risk of the disorder in children given the drug , @entity25			1
@entity5 received the vaccine at his local gp surgery on january 21 , 2010 , after mrs @entity10 was told he was ' at risk ' of the @entity30 virus because he was under five			1
but mrs @entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , said that within weeks of the jab she noticed a drastic change in her son			2
' he was a perfectly healthy energetic four - year - old before the vaccination , but within two weeks he was getting more tired and after three weeks he was sleeping for 19 hours			2
' things then developed quickly and he struggled to walk			0
nothing could convince me it was anything but the jab which caused @entity5 's conditions			1
' the government had a knee - jerk reaction to swine flu and put out this vaccine , giving it to very young children			0
' @entity5 , seven , is now on medication to control the condition but lives in constant fear of future episodes and refuses to do anything which may set them off , such as sledging @entity5 is now on medication to control the condition but they live in constant fear of narcolepsy attacks			1
mrs @entity10 , a civil servant , said : ' @entity59 can trigger attacks and @entity5 was too anxious about fear of an incident to go sledging in last week 's snow			1
' you see other children who can laugh and enjoy things and yes @entity5 can laugh and enjoy things but his reaction means that he goes unconscious			1
' we feel we are constantly treading on eggshells			0
' the vaccine was widely used in the @entity72 during the 2009 - 2010 flu pandemic and given to almost one million children between the ages of six months and five - years - old			0
however , after a number of trials across the @entity79 , it is no longer in use when links between the drug and narcolepsy were found in youngsters from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
sleepy : the youngster received the vaccine at his local @entity91 surgery on january 21 , 2010 in july 2011 the @entity92 advised against giving it to the under 20s			0
the @entity19 then commissioned a study in @entity72 children and found that there was an estimated risk of the disorder in one in 52,000 in those vaccinated			1
specialists reviewed 75 children aged between four and 18 who developed narcolepsy after the vaccine and found a 10-fold increased risk of the condition within six months of having the jab			1
these findings led them to state that the link suggested a ' causal association consistent with reports from @entity85 and @entity86 '			0
the results , which was highlighted in @entity116 programme @entity114 , saw prominent scientists agree with the findings			0
professor @entity119 , from the @entity120 , who was in charge of one of the paediatric clinical trials of @entity25 , said : ' the bottom line is that they found that there was somewhere between 10 and 16 times more likely to have had @entity25 than other children			1
' if you look at the figures , from what i can see the risk is so much increased that it seems very unlikely that this is a biased result			2
it is likely to be real			0
' now mrs @entity10 and father @entity136 , 47 , a printer , have joined a group of other parents preparing legal action after their children developed similar symptoms			2
but the @entity143 , which is responsible for administering the @entity144 , said there is currently insufficient medical evidence to show that the swine flu vaccine causes narcolepsy			0
mrs @entity10 said that the @entity19 report was a huge leap forward and she did not know how the government could ignore it			2
she added : ' that is the first report i have seen that has been published which shows that there is a 20 to 16 fold increase in cases since the vaccines was given			0
' that is a huge , huge , leap forward and i ca n't really see now how the government can turn around and say that there 's no link because obviously there is			0
' @entity165 , the pharmaceutical company which produced the drug , said it was working hard to better understand the research emerging from a number of countries			0
a spokesperson said : ' @entity171 is a complex disease and its causes are not yet fully understood but it is generally considered to be associated with genetic and environmental factors , including infections			0
' it is crucial we learn more about how narcolepsy is triggered and how @entity25 may have interacted with other risk factors in affected individuals			1

@entity5 developed condition within weeks of receiving @entity25
he would fall asleep even when he was walking , eating and swimming
@entity19 found ten-fold increased risk of disorder in children given the drug
