the frustration of waiting hours for your phone to charge could soon be a thing of the past thanks to an aluminium battery that recharges in less than 60 seconds			2
and the technology is both greener and safer than current batteries , as well as being flexible			0
it is the first high - performance aluminium battery that is ' fast - charging , long - lasting and inexpensive ' , according to its designers			2
the aluminium battery ( pictured ) was created at @entity11			2
it is said to be the first high - performance aluminium battery that is ' fast - charging , long - lasting and inexpensive ' the aluminium battery was created at @entity11 , @entity14 , and the findings have been published in the journal @entity17			1
lead author and professor of chemistry at the university , @entity21 , said : ' we have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices , such as alkaline batteries , which are bad for the environment , and lithium - ion batteries , which occasionally burst into flames			1
' our new battery wo n't catch fire , even if you drill through it			0
' aluminium is cheap and has a low flammability coupled with a high - charge storage capacity			0
the aluminium battery was created at @entity11			2
it consists of a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte			1
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch			1
and while lithium - ion batteries can take hours to charge , the new battery has ' unprecedented charging times ' of down to one minute			1
unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges , the @entity11 battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity			0
it is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries , and ca n't catch fire like lithium - ion technology			1
at present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity , the highest achieved yet with aluminium			0
' but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium - ion technology			1
but scientists have struggled to make a commercially viable aluminium - ion battery because of the difficulty in finding materials capable of producing sufficient voltage after repeated cycles of charging and discharging			2
the aluminum - ion battery consists of two electrodes - a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte			1
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch			1
@entity11 graduate student @entity81 added : ' the electrolyte is basically a salt that 's liquid at room temperature , so it 's very safe			0
' lithium - ion batteries can be a fire hazard			1
' in our study , we have videos showing that you can drill through the aluminium battery pouch , and it will continue working for a while longer without catching fire			2
' but lithium batteries can go off in an unpredictable manner in the air , the car or in your pocket			0
besides safety , we have achieved major breakthroughs in aluminium battery performance			0
' and while lithium - ion battery can take hours to charge , the new battery has ' unprecedented charging times ' of down to one minute			1
unlike other prototypes which die after just 100 charges , the @entity11 battery can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity			0
by comparison , a typical lithium - ion battery lasts about 1,000 cycles			1
mr @entity81 continued : ' another feature of the aluminum battery is flexibility			0
the battery consists of a negatively charged anode made of aluminum and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte			1
these sit inside a flexible polymer - coated pouch			1
it can also withstand more than 7,500 cycles without any loss of capacity at present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity , the highest achieved yet with aluminium			0
' but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of lithium - ion ( stock image ) ' you can bend it and fold it , so it has the potential for use in flexible electronic devices			1
aluminium is also a cheaper metal than lithium			0
' at present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity , the highest achieved yet with aluminium			0
' but the researchers explained the battery has a limited voltage , compared to existing technology			0
' our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery , ' professor @entity21 said : ' but improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density			2
' otherwise , our battery has everything else you 'd dream that a battery should have : inexpensive electrodes , good safety , high - speed charging , flexibility and long cycle life			0
i see this as a new battery in its early days			0

the flexible aluminium battery was created at @entity11
it consists of a negatively charged aluminium anode and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte
it sits in a flexible polymer - coated ' pouch ' and recharges in one minute
but it currently offers just half the voltage of existing lithium - ion batteries
