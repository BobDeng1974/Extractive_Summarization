@entity1 biologists says they can slow the aging process by activating a gene by ' remote control			2
' scientists at the university 's @entity7 published a paper this month that found activating a gene called @entity12 in fruit fly cells increased the insects ' lifespans by about 30 percent and lived healthier lives			1
the treatment could one day be used to increase human lifespan and stave off disease by stimulating the gene in targeted organs or organ systems			1
triggered : by activating @entity12 in the cells of fruit flies , researchers at @entity1 found they could significantly increase their lifespan the study found that when @entity12 was increased in cells in the nervous system , not only did the those cells age slower but the cells in the intestines did as well			1
the reverse was true when @entity12 was targeted in intestinal cells			0
after treatment , the fruit flies in the study increased their lifespan from six weeks to eight weeks			1
by tweaking levels of @entity12 , scientists were allowing cells to dump ' cellular garbage , ' components that cells discard due to damage or age			0
discarding this material earlier avoids damage to the cell and prevents the aging process			0
@entity50 , associate professor at @entity1 and senior author of the research , is hopeful that the treatment could one day be used to prevent the debilitating diseases associated with aging			0
new life : biologists at the @entity7 at @entity1 are hopeful that this research could prevent aging - related diseases like @entity60 's " instead of studying the diseases of aging — parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , cancer , stroke , cardiovascular disease , diabetes — one by one , we believe it may be possible to intervene in the aging process and delay the onset of many of these diseases , " said @entity50			0
@entity75 writes fruit flies are used in gene studies because scientists have already cataloged the entirety of the fruit fly 's genes and can activate targeted genes			2
the lead author of the study said that a drug used to treat diabetes type 2 could be used to activate @entity12 in humans .			2

biologists conducted a study on fruit flies that found activating a gene called @entity12 increased the flies ' lives by 30 percent
they hope the treatment could be used to increase human lifespan
