he has just been given licence to pick one of the finest backs of the era for the @entity5 , but @entity6 is more pre-occupied with the denigration of his @entity9 pack			1
@entity11 playmaker @entity10 could be a glorious asset at the showpiece tournament after @entity9 ’s policy against picking players based abroad was relaxed this week , but one thing he ca n’t do is anchor the scrum			1
the national coach refuses to bite back , but he has evidently noted and logged claims from these parts that his forwards will be cannon fodder for their @entity24 and @entity25 rivals , amid the three - way tussle for qualification from daunting @entity28 @entity9 head coach @entity6 is aware that his pack is being written off for the @entity5 @entity6 's side will face @entity31 and @entity32 in crunch pool games at the tournament in september @entity31 's pack demolished @entity9 at scrum - time during last november 's 26 - 17 victory at @entity38 in fact , many of the claims have come from these pages			1
speaking to @entity43 from @entity44 , @entity6 repeatedly name - checked a certain knight of the realm and columnist of this newspaper , among the voices arguing that the green - and - gold pack will be smashed into submission			1
‘ it has been pretty well reported here that @entity54 and others have said that @entity31 are going to take us apart in the forwards , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s what we ’ve been hearing			2
i understand that they will have a lot of confidence in their forwards to take us on , but i think you discount the @entity24 backs at your peril , because they have some very powerful runners			0
in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , they have three half - backs who will challenge the line every time			0
‘ @entity78 looks like a nice player and they ’ve got some good options in midfield now			1
@entity83 will come back into it , they have @entity86 too and big @entity88 ( @entity87 ) might even get a run soon enough , as he grows into the game			2
@entity91 has done well for @entity31 at 10 , they ’ve got fast wingers and i ’m a big fan of @entity93 at full - back			1
there are a variety of threats that we will have to deal with			2
’ @entity6 ’s admiration for @entity31 ’s attacking runners behind the scrum is part of the former @entity104 coach ’s overall assertion that the @entity106 nations are just as adept at playing an open game as their southern rivals , when conditions allow			1
but his repeated references to the pre-tournament dismissal of his pack suggest that there will be a strong emphasis on the set piece in particular during the @entity5 countdown over the summer			1
@entity11 playmaker @entity10 ( left ) is set to feature for the @entity9 at the @entity5 ‘ commentators in the @entity119 are saying we wo n’t be able to match it with @entity31 and @entity32 in the forwards , ’ he reiterated			1
‘ they ’re saying that it ’s a shame to waste the talent in our backs			0
there ’s been a fair bit of that coming out , but we ’re working hard to make up ground in that area			0
‘ @entity54 – who is not just your average spectator – says we wo n’t be able to compete with the @entity24 scrum			0
for us , it ’s about having a clear philosophy about how we want to do it then practising a lot			0
we will aim to be at our best in every single scrum			0
’ according to @entity6 , the epic final day of this year ’s @entity139 – truly ‘ @entity140 ’ – gave a vivid demonstration to viewers down under about the threat to the @entity9 from @entity31 and @entity32			1
‘ both those sides are shaping up well , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity31 will be on home soil and the @entity25 will be much closer to home than we will be			2
i ’m sure they will be fancying their chances against us			0
most people are looking at us as the ones who will be in the most trouble , but we will relish it and enjoy it			0
‘ @entity31 and @entity32 will be feeling good about themselves after the @entity139			1
the performance by @entity32 against @entity157 in their final game was incredible			2
i was watching it until it was 13 - 12 and it was the wee small hours here so i went to bed			0
when i woke up , they had won by 50 ! when they needed to , they were able to do that and that is very confidence - building			0
’ as a long - standing fan of rugby league , @entity6 is well aware of @entity87 ’s potential to make a major impact in his new code , once he has come through the transition phase			1
he is preparing for the @entity173 player to be unleashed against @entity9 ; a country where he is revered in light of his title - winning exploits for the @entity177 in @entity44			2
@entity6 has cited @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 as dangerous no 9 's who challenge the advantage line @entity78 ( second left ) was superb for @entity181 's side throughout the @entity139 ‘ i believe that he will be picked and that @entity31 will use him as a weapon off the bench with 10 or 15 minutes to go , ’ he said			1
‘ he is a class footballer – a quality player and athlete			0
he ’s aggressive too , which he showed with the way he played in the rugby league @entity187 here last year			2
‘ you would have him involved just for his mental approach and the way he takes the game on			0
there are going to be some tough calls , but just the fact that he is in the reckoning at all – even though he ’s only been in union a few months and had never played it before – is positive for him			0
’ in contrast to his @entity200 counterpart , @entity199 , who is concerned that rugby is becoming boring , @entity6 is expecting an ‘ awesome ’ @entity5 with an emphasis on try - scoring , thanks in part to the improved pitches at leading grounds here such as @entity38 and the @entity207			1
‘ it is like playing on a carpet , ’ he said			0
‘ it makes teams a lot more confident to play positive footy			0
’ @entity9 should be able to play positively , with their backline enhanced by the presence of @entity10 – who had been in @entity219 exile since moving to @entity11 in 2011			1
@entity6 confirmed yesterday that he met the 32 - year - old recently , prior to the announcement of the @entity223 ’s historic policy change and believes that he can add utility value to the @entity9 squad			1
‘ as far as i know , @entity10 has played no 9 there , on the odd occasion , ’ he said			2
‘ his strength is at @entity229 12 obviously			0
’ there will be reinforcements up front too , with veteran flanker @entity233 another exile now back on the radar			0
he could find himself competing against a fit and revitalised @entity237 , and @entity238 – vying with hooker @entity239 for the captaincy – for the openside berth			0
with such pedigree in just one position , @entity9 ’s pack can not be written off lightly			1
@entity6 will use the jibes from afar to make sure his side are ready for the ‘ @entity247 ’			2
@entity31 full back @entity93 rises high to claim a high ball despite the attention of @entity250 @entity6 is convinced @entity87 will feature for @entity31 at the @entity5 despite his quiet start in union @entity237 is set to return to lead @entity9 after struggling with injury over the past three seasons			1

@entity9 will face @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity256 at the @entity5
the @entity9 pack was taken apart by @entity31 at @entity38 last year
@entity6 cites @entity93 and @entity78 as key threats
@entity87 will feature for @entity31 at tournament , says @entity6
@entity6 met @entity10 this week to discuss his involvement
