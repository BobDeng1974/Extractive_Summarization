mother - of - two @entity5 , 34 , was brutally bashed by her partner of 11 years in front of her five - year - old son at @entity10 north of @entity11 on august 3 , 2013			1

she briefly wore a fake acrylic eye over the top of it but does not wear it any more as it is painful			0
ms @entity5 is telling her story because she wants to show the permanent damage that many victims of domestic violence are left with and the need for greater support for victims			1
' when people ask you , " what 's wrong with your eye ? have you got an infection ? " that painful memory comes back , ' she said			0
' i ca n't turn around and say , " i was in a car accident " - ( those victims ) do n't like how they look , but it 's not as bad saying " someone bashed me "			2
' i wish it never happened but everyday i have to look at it			0
' ' i have a lot less confidence now being out in public because i do n't want people to stare at my face			0
' for the first year afterwards i did n't even want to leave my house			0
' on top of her permanent injury and the unavoidable reminders , ms @entity5 said the attack resulted in her being subjected to a lengthy court process , extensive hospital time , ' millions of eye appointments ' , counselling for herself and her son - all while the family moved house			1
' i lived in stress , hell			0
i was in and out of hospital , and then sitting around waiting for that decision - your life 's just hanging ( in the balance )			0
' the attack , which the court heard happened in front of several witnesses , came after what she said was years of ' controlling ' behaviour from her partner who she had been planning to leave in the weeks leading up to the assault			2
her partner checked her internet history and found she had been looking at rental properties , she told @entity35			2
' i 'd gone home and looked at rentals ( in july 2013 ) and he found my internet search history and went off at me			0
her partner checked her internet history and found she had been looking at rental properties before and after : ms @entity5 used to wears her hair over her right eye ( pictured right ) to prevent people from asking questions about the damage done @entity10 , north of @entity11 , where the incident occurred ' by 2013 i felt really trapped			1
i just did n't know what to do			0
' ms @entity5 used to hide her eye under her hair and sometimes shields it under her sunglasses to prevent questions about it			1
with help , she is beginning to feel better			0
' i 'm starting to get better			0
i 'm not covering my face			0
i still do n't like making eye contact with people			0
' ms @entity5 's ' dead eye ' may need to be removed ms @entity5 is now on the front foot regarding domestic violence , saying its victims are ' left to wear scars ' she said there are charities in the @entity160 and the @entity161 - such as an @entity161 organisation called @entity163 - which help domestic violence victims restore their appearance , but nothing comparable in @entity4			1
' there 's a lot of people with permanent injuries through domestic violence who are left to wear those scars , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' it 's a reminder of something you do n't want to be reminded of '			0
according to the @entity178 , one in three @entity4 women experience physical or sexual violence from someone known to them			2
instead , the @entity181 has been criticised for reportedly cutting funds to as many as 50 community services agencies which provide support to victims of domestic and family violence			1
domestic violence has , however , been placed on the agenda at the @entity189 ( @entity189 )			2
and the issue is gaining a bigger spotlight after family violence survivor @entity192 - whose son @entity193 was murdered by her husband at a cricket ground - was named the @entity196 last month			2
ms @entity5 , who said she had been frightened of leaving her partner , said : ' if there 's not enough help out there , it 's less likely a person is going to go to one of those places ( a refuge ) for help			1
' ms @entity5 said there was a misconception that many victims of domestic violence are from a lower socio - economic background or that substance abuse involved , but neither of that applied to her			1
she said that if someone is aware of domestic violence happening they should report it to the police , just as they would report an attack they witnessed in public			2
' domestic violence is n't something that just happens to " those people " , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' it cuts across all races , ethnicities , sexual orientations and socio - economic classes			0
' the only good thing i can say out of this now is that i 've got my children out of that house			0
' they 're not going to witness any more of that violence			0

@entity5 , 34 , was brutally punched by her partner during a family day out in @entity11
her husband was last week sentenced to eighteen months prison , eligible for parole in nine months
these are the pictures that show the shocking reality of domestic violence in @entity4
every time she looks in the mirror she is reminded of the incident
ms @entity5 wants to bring attention to the lack of services for domestic violence victims and the physical scars it leaves
