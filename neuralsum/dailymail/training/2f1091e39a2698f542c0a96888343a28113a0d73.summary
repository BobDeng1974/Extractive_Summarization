the red planet has a new scar after a fresh impact crater was found on @entity5 ' @entity4 volcanic region			1
discovered by the @entity7 , astronomers believe it was created between february 2012 and june 2014			1
the image shows a very distinct crater rim and ejecta that is much darker than the surrounding dust - covered terrain			1

researchers used the @entity28 camera to examine this site after orbiter 's @entity30 had revealed a change in appearance			2
the 143lb ( 65kg ) , £ 26.4 million ( $ 40 million ) instrument was built under the direction of the @entity37 's @entity38			2
it consists of a 0.5 metre ( 19.7 inch ) aperture reflecting telescope - the largest so far of any deep space mission			1
this allows it to take pictures of @entity5 with resolutions of 0.3 m / pixel ( about 1ft )			2

temperatures in fourteen states from @entity66 to @entity67 reported temperatures colder than @entity5 , as a brutal blast of @entity71 air sweeps the country			2
@entity5 just recently passed its closest orbit to the sun , which partially explains why the temperature was relatively balmy			2
the @entity58 is also located in one of the warmest parts of the planet , near the equator			0
@entity4 is the second largest volcanic region on @entity5 after @entity80 , and is around 1,050 miles by 1 490 miles ( 1,700 by 2,400 km ) in size			1
all of @entity5 ’ impact craters can be viewed using a map created by the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) in @entity85			1
taking 16 years to create , this colourful map describes the geography of @entity5 as it is today while also shedding light on the red planet ’s watery past			0
' spacecraft exploration of @entity5 over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials , events and processes shaped its surface , ' said @entity84 scientist and lead author , dr @entity99			0
' the new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time , providing information to generate and test new hypotheses			0
' out of the thousands of craters , earlier this year one has emerged as the likely source of most of the @entity5 meteorites that have been found on @entity111			0
researchers believe the @entity113 , a 34 - mile ( 55km ) wide basin on the @entity5 ’s equator is the origin of the “ shergottites ” meteorites			1
these are a group of meteorites that includes about 75 per cent of the 150 known @entity5 meteorites			0
scientists are keen to learn where the meteorites came from as it would help them piece together the history of @entity5			0
