a @entity1 mp has been reprimanded and fined for using allegedly sexist grammar in the @entity4 parliament			1
in a bizarre case which will be of particular interest to @entity9 people who have struggled over ' le ' and ' la ' during torturous @entity1 lessons , @entity5 called a senior colleague ‘ @entity13 le president ’			1
‘ madame le president ’ is technically correct , because all nouns in @entity1 have a sex , and ‘ president ’ is a male word			1
@entity20 faux pas : @entity21 called @entity22 , the @entity23 president in the @entity24 , ‘ @entity13 le president ’ , prompting her to fine him £ 1,000 , even though it 's grammatically correct but @entity22 , the @entity23 president in the @entity24 , objected to the term , saying she was clearly a woman and should be ‘ madame @entity30 ’ , with an ‘ e ’ on the end			1
during a parliamentary session on monday , ms @entity22 said : ‘ mr @entity5 i ’m calling you to order			2
it ’s " @entity34 "			0
it ’s a call to order without a fine , but next time ... ’ but mr @entity5 , of the conservative @entity36 , refused to comply , pointing out that according to @entity37 , @entity1 ’s language police , ‘ @entity34 ’ would refer to the president ’s wife			2
this prompted ms @entity41 to issue a formal fine equivalent to just over £ 1,000 , and he was officially reprimanded			1
left wingers supported the move , with @entity46 mp @entity45 insisting : ‘ this is n’t trivial			2
many respectful @entity36 members do n’t do this kind of thing			0
’ @entity51 , a high profile feminist politician , tweeted : ‘ a woman at the head of @entity54 seems to bother the @entity36			2
it ’s true , it ’s only 2014 after all			0
’ but @entity57 , another member of the @entity36 , said it was ‘ a grotesque and ridiculous sanction ' against mr @entity5 , adding the ' socialists bring back the thought police '			0
@entity62 , also a @entity36 mp , said : ‘ the sanction against @entity21 is dumb , @entity41 is abusing her powers			1
’ the @entity54 : left wingers supported the sanction against mr @entity5 , but his colleagues in the right - wing @entity36 party accused ms @entity22 of abusing her powers set up to guarantee the purity of the @entity1 language , @entity37 has led the rearguard action against the increasing influence of what it calls the ‘ @entity74 ’ of @entity1 life			1
it has sometimes ordered censorship of films from across the @entity79 , and ensured huge subsidies for dubbing firms and the @entity1 film industry			0
a commission chosen from among its 40 members - known as ' @entity85 ' - advises on what new words should be entered into the @entity1 dictionary , studiously guarding against foreign impurities , notably those from @entity90			0
bizarrely , the most recent addition to their number is , in fact , an @entity94			0
@entity97 , a 74 - year - old professor of literature from @entity99 , south - west @entity96 , was admitted in may .			0

@entity21 was technically correct , because ' president ' is a male word
he pointed out ' madame la president ' would mean the president 's wife
@entity54 president @entity22 was *nonetheless* *offended*
she officially reprimanded the mp and fined him the equivalent of £ 1,000
