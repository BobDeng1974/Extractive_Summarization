@entity0 ran out of time to stave off relegation , and return to @entity3 of the @entity4 after their @entity6 shoot - out with @entity8 ended in a stalemate			1
only a home victory could have sent @entity8 down instead and - after bad weather took 14 overs out of the last day - the @entity13 closed out the draw on 341 for eight declared and with no prospect of a successful chase of 253 in the hour remaining			1
veteran @entity0 captain @entity17 performed heroics to keep hopes of survival alive when he scrambled the necessary extra batting bonus point here 24 hours earlier			2
@entity0 captain @entity17 looks dejected as @entity8 survived at their expense @entity24 ( centre ) is congratulated by a @entity8 team - mate but neither he nor the best efforts of @entity28 ( three for 84 ) and @entity29 ( three for 106 ) could break @entity8 's resistance as they secured top - flight safety at their hosts ' expense			1
by the time @entity17 had to accept the inevitable , glorious evening sunshine had replaced the morning rain which narrowed @entity0 's window of opportunity - yet for the @entity37 , the mood was sombre as they were relegated for the second time in three years			1
@entity8 had resumed on 202 for four on an initially dank @entity40 day , just 114 in front and vulnerable to a surge of wickets for the home attack			2
they were to lose only four in 60 overs , before @entity17 shook hands with his opposite number @entity48 midway through the last session			0
@entity8 can therefore contemplate the closest of shaves at the end of a season they began with a rush of early victories			2
they ran out of steam alarmingly from june onwards , but rediscovered much - needed resilience to beat the drop with draws here and - from a highly - improbable position - away to @entity61 last week			0
for @entity0 , the step back into the second tier comes in a summer which has seen an overdue title success for their @entity67 rivals @entity66 - and means last year 's two promoted teams , themselves and @entity69 , have both gone immediately back down			2
in the 10.2 overs possible before the rain arrived , @entity28 provided the solitary wicket before lunch - but it was a big one , with a very good delivery			0
@entity28 's ( three for 84 ) was n't enough to earn victory for @entity0 @entity78 was @entity8 's chief hope to defuse any home momentum , but was undone by late movement back into him from @entity0 's left - armer to hit his back pad and win an obvious lbw verdict			1
there was then time for just one more ball , before heavy drizzle swept in and precluded all but 35 minutes of the morning session			0
a frustrating interruption followed for the @entity37 - who nonetheless returned still on a mission , @entity28 ending @entity93 's vigil with the score on double - nelson 222			0
the stoic @entity96 had been dropped on nought the previous evening , and by the time he finally played on had held @entity0 up for 111 minutes in all			1
another drop , @entity0 's seventh of the match , cost just a single when @entity102 - born @entity101 mis - pulled @entity29 to mid-wicket just two balls after being put down by a diving @entity107 off the first over of a new @entity110 spell			0
@entity0 's @entity17 shakes hands with @entity8 chief @entity112 afterwards the next time the captain brought himself back into the attack , he struck instantly and , it seemed , importantly - nipping one off the seam into @entity117 to have him lbw			1
but if 277 for eight 40 minutes before tea represented plenty of hope still for a feasible chase , it was an illusion which did not last			0
instead , tailenders @entity123 and @entity24 resisted with minimal alarm in an unbroken stand of 64 - to hugely contrasting emotions on the pitch , but uniform misery among the vast majority of a near 1,000 crowd who had been willing a different conclusion			0
@entity0 trudge off after their relegation to @entity3 was confirmed			1

@entity0 down down to @entity3 following draw with rivals
hosts needed a win to escape relegation and send @entity141 down instead
bad weather meant @entity0 ran out of time as @entity8 held on
