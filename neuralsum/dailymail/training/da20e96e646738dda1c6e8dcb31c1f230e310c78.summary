you wait years for a new console to turn up , and then two arrive at once			2
following @entity5 ’s @entity4 launch last week , @entity2 have finally launched their @entity6 – and the good news is , there ’s plenty of quality launch games			1
here , @entity11 runs the rule over the biggest ones			2
killzone : shadow fall 5/5 simply the best : at the risk of annoying @entity4 fans , @entity14 : @entity18 is hands - down the best - looking launch title on either console quite simply , breath - taking			1
boasting visuals on par with some of the best - looking pc games around , @entity18 is the definitive launch title to show the @entity6 ’s impressive power			1
but it ’s not all style over substance			2
following the painfully average @entity14 on last - gen , @entity18 is a real step forward in the series in terms of level design and gameplay			1
clearly influenced by @entity34 and @entity35 , there ’s less emphasis on shooting from behind cover and firefights encourage you to use the multi-tiered levels to your advantage			2
coupled with the new owl – a handy flying drone that lets you shoot ziplines , hack terminals and attack baddies - and there 's plenty of freedom to approach levels how you want			1
@entity53 is strong , too			1
enemies will flank and throw grenades if you ’re too ‘ cover happy ’			2
but the star of the show are the environments			0
gone are the grey , mono - tone city - scapes that plagued the last games			1
here , you ’ll be dodging trains in the sun - kissed city of @entity67 , skydive from orbit and glide between crumbling buildings , and traverse ruined worlds where the ground falls apart beneath your feet			1
@entity18 is n’t just a launch game			1
it ’s the launch game , and essential for any @entity6 owner			0
call of duty : ghosts 3/5 that a boy : @entity78 is one of many new characters in ghosts and takes centre stage during stealth missions it may not do anything to evolve the series ( in fact , some may argue it ’s a step back ) , but there ’s still fun to be had here			0
after the brilliant opening level - which somehow manages to mix a walk in the woods with a mission to space - it 's very much business as usual			1
new mechanics including the use of a ' remote controlled ' dog , @entity78 , are fun but ultimately underdeveloped , while the set - pieces are n't quite as epic as you 'd expect			1
you do , however , get to see a @entity103 take down a helicopter ... unlike the @entity4 , ghosts runs in 1080p ( full high definition ) on @entity6 , so expect it to be on par with @entity110 versions of the game			0
compared to current - gen , framerate runs at @entity113 consistently , so everything feels more fluid , too			1
far from an essential purchase , and not quite a ' next - gen ' cod , but still worth a look if you have n’t bought it already			1
@entity119 – 4/5 blast from the past : @entity119 does nothing to show off the power of the hardware , but oozes charm and an addictive pick - up - and - play structure some may find it strange seeing this game among the heavy - hitters at launch , but do n’t write this quirky offering off too quickly			1
harking back to the golden age of gaming , this deliciously simple platformer offers something completely different to the other titles			1
you play @entity138 , who ’s on a mission to save his friends			0
cue loads of levels , incredibly cute enemies and a solid retro soundtrack			0
it wo n’t show off the @entity6 ’s power by any means , but as a cut - price title it ’s fantastic value for money and worryingly addictive , too			1
plus , it 's sure to appeal to fans of ' indie - style ' games			1
injustice : @entity156 4/5 @entity157 rises ( again ) : this may be one of the ' older ' games available at launch , but for comic book fans who have n't played it yet , injustice is worth picking up ca n’t wait to see @entity166 take on @entity167 on the big screen in a couple of years ? then this is for you			1
developed by the team behind the acclaimed last - gen @entity175 remake , this beat - em - up lets you play as some of the world ’s most famous superheroes			1
all are beautifully recreated and have trademark moves that stay true to their roots			0
@entity166 , for example , can call in the @entity184 to run foes over – while @entity186 can sprint around the world before upper - cutting his opponent in the face			1
there are plenty of levels , too , ranging from @entity167 ’s ice cave and the dark , back streets of @entity196 , to the @entity198 hq that floats miles above the @entity199			0
each stage is multi-tiered with stunning ' transitional moves ' used to unlock each area			0
fights are cleverly interwoven into a strong narrative , too – so , unlike @entity4 exclusive @entity206 ( which , in fairness , is targeting a slightly different audience ) , there ’s plenty of incentive to play on your own			1
knack 2/5 have n't got the knack of it : at times @entity214 looks great - but , similar to @entity215 ; son of @entity218 , there 's no depth there is always going to be one dud in a launch line - up , and this year it ’s @entity214			1
do n’t be charmed by its ( semi ) impressive visuals , for this bland platformer offers nothing apart from repetitive combat and boring platforming elements			1
most of the game is spent strolling through levels and dodging attacks			0
tedious enough , but made even worse by frequent slowdown			0
in its defence , there is some variation in the level design – ranging from ice caves to forests – and at times it can look rather pretty			0
but it ’s lacking the ' soul ' and charm of , say , @entity119			0
@entity247 4/5 burn rubber : in @entity250 you can choose to play as a cop or a racer , then zoom around in the world 's fastest cars ‘ where are the slow motion crashes of @entity258 ? ’ some fans may ask			0
no matter , as this stunning racer gets nearly everything else perfect			0
set in the open - world of @entity264 , you can choose to be either a cop or a racer			2
the former is tasked with bringing as many @entity268 to justice – helped with a variety of @entity272 tech. these range from roadblocks to calling in @entity276 choppers			2
racers , on the other hand , have their own weapons – such as @entity280 and other evasion tech. it also introduces the @entity284 system , where players can seamlessly transfer from playing on their own to playing with the online community			0
graphically , it looks stunning – and runs arguably smoother than on @entity4			0
the star of the show , though , are the cars			0
speed through a puddle , and you ’ll be treated to every last drop of water delicately sliding down their pixel - perfect chassis			2
whereas @entity297 focused on simulation , @entity250 portrays its exotic cars as grunting beasts that need manhandling if you 're to tame @entity264 's challenging corners			0
thanks to an in - game gps system , you ’re constantly given the shortest routes to objectives – be that other races or time trails , so you ’re never out of the action for long			2
battlefield 4 4/5 what a view : this shot , taken from the opening level , is one of the most memorable sights in the single - player campaign			2
still , most will skip this and dive straight into the glorious multiplayer the campaign may have been a bit of a mixed bag with critics ( i , for one , enjoyed it ) , but there is no doubt this is the best first - person multiplayer game around at the moment			2
thanks to the @entity6 ’s superior power , you can play with 32 players on each side – meaning the large maps are much less sparse than on current gen. powered by the ‘ full fat ’ frostbite 3 engine , it looks wonderful , too – just a fraction behind the very top pc versions			0
you ’ll often be torn between choosing @entity339 or @entity340 , but this year , @entity340 is a clear winner			0
@entity342 5/5 look out below ! the @entity343 takes on @entity344 in the brilliant @entity342 another epic super hero game – this time a bit more tongue in cheek			0
yes , it ’s been out for a while and is on @entity4 – but those who opt for this system will be hard - pressed to find a more enjoyable platformer			2
featuring an eclectic mix of the best - known heroes and a glorious open - world to explore , this will keep the kids happy for a long time			1
closing thoughts so , which console has the better line up ? clearly both sides have strengths and weaknesses			0
@entity215 : @entity365 on @entity4 is a graphical masterpiece for the most part , but suffers from linear gameplay			0
but the @entity4 claws back serious points with @entity297 5			0
the @entity6 , however , has a genuine classic in @entity14 : @entity18 , something perhaps lacking with the @entity4 launch titles			1
the line - up is somewhat let down by @entity214 - a game that at one stage showed some promise - but this still fares better than both @entity377 and @entity378 on @entity4			2
follow us on @entity380 : @ @entity381 and on @entity382 : @entity383 .			0

genuine classic in @entity14 : @entity18 , featuring some of the most mind - blowing visuals so far in gaming
strong variety of games - pity that @entity392 was delayed
