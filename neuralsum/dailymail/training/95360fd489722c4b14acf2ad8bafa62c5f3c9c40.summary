but @entity5 , who actually became a @entity7 cabbie before playing one in @entity9 , remains an enigma himself			1
the star is so notoriously sphinx - like about his private life that even co-stars have admitted they have n’t a clue what he is really like			2
now , an exhaustive biography has claimed that @entity5 ’s obsessive secretiveness may cover more than his natural shyness			1
in @entity5 : a life , film writer @entity36 also reveals new details about the actor ’s compulsive womanising and sometimes high - handed treatment of the black women he chose to seduce , including claims that he pressured one of them to have an abortion			1
he may not have appeared in a truly great film for more than 20 years , but @entity5 is still spoken of with awe by movie buffs who recall his glory years in the @entity51 and @entity52			1

although biographer @entity36 is star - struck by @entity5 ’s brooding performances , he admits the actor could be thin - skinned , quick - tempered and focused on his career above all else			1
@entity5 as @entity61 in @entity30 ( 1980 )			1
he won @entity66 for the performance at the @entity60 the actor plays @entity69 in 1976 movie @entity9 - a film which also starred actress @entity72 socially , he was something of a cold fish			1

the new biography contains other accusations of @entity5 bullying women			1
actress @entity72 starred with him in the 1976 drama @entity9 and said there was ‘ enormous chemistry ’ between them			0
but when he asked her out , she turned him down			0
according to film director @entity192 , @entity193 ’s boyfriend at the time , @entity5 then made her life hell on set			1
if @entity5 was famously inarticulate in interviews , he had no trouble chatting up women			1

he would often chase women in his car , accost them at public events and even see them on tv or in print , then contact them through third parties			0

they broke up several times but kept reuniting			0
in the 1990s he also had ‘ dalliances ’ with singer @entity218 and model @entity219 , and occasional dates with his co-star @entity26 , writes @entity36			1
a woman who outlasted many in the actor ’s attentions was a vivacious @entity7 model named @entity111			0

he did n’t deny it , but insisted he had never paid for her company — which prosecutors accepted			0
though @entity5 is still married to @entity232 , it has been a tempestuous partnership			2
some have blamed @entity5 ’s failure to establish stable relationships with the opposite sex on him seeing his mother do the same			1
she left @entity5 ’s father — a renowned expressionist painter , who was bisexual — after just two years ’ marriage , and her son watched with dismay as she went through a string of short - lived boyfriends			2
he was an only child , and @entity36 believes it was the loneliness of those years — raised among adults with , often , no playmates — that helps to explain the secretive and guarded man he became			2
it may also explain why he became such a driven and brilliant actor .			0
