we will be confronted with tensions and problems , we have seen that already in a country like @entity277			0
' we have seen that also - even though the situation was different - in the unrest in @entity187 in 2011			0
' in @entity248 - and the @entity3 is not apart from @entity248 - if the economic pressure on people goes on , yes , it will have a social impact on people			1
