by @entity0 published : 17:06 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 23 september 2012 foul - mouthed cabinet minister @entity1 should be sacked for insulting police officers who made him get off his bicycle at the gates to @entity5 , according to a @entity6 in three believe the chief whip should be forced to quit , with barely one in five backing his fight to hang on to his job			1
calls for sacking : many have called for @entity1 to go after his ' foul mouthed rant ' even conservative voters have turned on him – more than half say he should go , with fewer than one in three backing him			1
mr @entity1 stayed tight - lipped yesterday as the furore continued over claims that he called police ‘ morons ’ and ‘ f * * * * * g plebs ’ in a petulant outburst			1
@entity25 mps and senior @entity27 officials said he would be lucky to survive , while others gave additional alleged examples of the @entity32 pupil ’s high - handed manner			1
according to civil servants at the @entity40 – run by mr @entity1 , 56 , until the @entity34 reshuffle earlier this month – his insistence on receiving vip treatment while on foreign trips with his special adviser @entity38 , sometimes backfired			1
‘ he liked to be the last passenger on board the plane , presumably so he did n’t have to get on with the plebs , ’ said one			1
‘ airline staff would get fed up with it and on at least one occasion he missed the plane as a result			1
they shut the gate and would n’t let him on			1
he was furious and had to get another flight			1
’ one @entity25 mp said he had been the victim of another four - letter tirade by mr @entity56			1
he recalled : ‘ i was an aspiring mp and had committed a minor indiscretion that @entity1 took exception to			2
‘ he told me , “ while i have a single f * * * * * g breath in my body i will make sure you never become an mp			2
” the man is an appalling bully			2
i can see why he was known as @entity66 at @entity67			2
’ friends of the prime minister say they warned him against promoting mr @entity1 to chief whip because of his reputation for politically incorrect tantrums			1
@entity73 and mr @entity1 fell out when the allies of mr @entity1 made allegations of a dirty - tricks campaign when they were both rivals seeking their first parliamentary seat			2
relations between the two deteriorated further when mr @entity1 ran @entity80 ’s unsuccessful bid to beat mr @entity73 in the 2005 @entity25 leadership contest			2
it was only after mr @entity1 ’s ally @entity83 intervened on his behalf that a wary mr @entity73 gave mr @entity1 a second chance			0
mr @entity1 then promptly fell out with mr @entity80			0
a senior minister said : ‘ @entity1 got back in with @entity73 by crawling			1
whenever he is within ten yards of the pm you can hear the sound of slurping			0
’ one mp who criticised the prime minister in front of mr @entity1 was surprised by his response			0
‘ he said , “ whenever my local activists complain about @entity73 i tell them do n’t blame me , i ran @entity80 ’s campaign			0
” i am not sure if he was joking			0
’ hanging on : @entity1 on his bicycle at the gates to @entity5 mr @entity1 ’s supporters freely admit that he can be volatile , but say he is ‘ misunderstood ’			0
one said : ‘ for 99 per cent of the time he is charm personified – you have to ignore the bluster			0
’ mr @entity1 is hoping that the tradition whereby the chief whip does not speak in public will help him to survive this storm			1
it means he is less likely to be challenged to account for his verbal onslaught against the @entity112 rebel @entity25 claimed mr @entity1 was now ‘ neutered ’ as chief whip			0
‘ he can no longer enforce party discipline , ’ said the mp			0
‘ if he calls me in to discipline me , i will say , “ you insulted a policeman , that ’s worse than anything i have done , so back off			0
” ’ conservative mp @entity120 said ‘ stupid ’ mr @entity1 should resign if he had made the remarks attributed to him , adding : ‘ it defies belief that anyone could swear at a police officer – especially one who was in @entity5 to protect the prime minister			0
’ fellow @entity25 mp @entity128 said : ‘ @entity1 ’s actions strengthen the impression that those at the top of the party are a bunch of elitists who think they are better than others			0
’ video : @entity137 calls on the @entity127 to find out what really happened ...			0

senior @entity27 officials say he will be ' lucky to survive '
