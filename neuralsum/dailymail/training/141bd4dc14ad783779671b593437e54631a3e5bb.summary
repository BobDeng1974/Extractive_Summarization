they are two of the hottest properties in the @entity2 , the @entity3 hotshots who will surely decide sunday ’s big showdown between @entity5 and @entity6			1
but which of @entity8 and @entity9 is the better player ? @entity10 and @entity11 sat down for an appreciation , some arguing and a very difficult decision ... so , what is it that makes them so dangerous ? @entity10 : they are fantastic all - round footballers but it ’s their ability to run at players and terrorise defenders that makes them so good			1
they love to fly forward and are able to change direction in an instant — it ’s that speed of thought and technique that strikes fear into opponents			0
they can absolutely embarrass players with their pace but almost always produce something special at the end of it			0
@entity11 : there are similarities in their game but i think they ’re quite different in terms of their movement			1
@entity8 is perpetual motion and does not stop running whereas @entity9 is much more economical			1
he will run , stop a defender , then go again			0
he waits for his moment and , bang , he ’s in			0
@entity8 is different — he chases lost causes all over the pitch			1
it ’s a cliche to say he covers every blade of grass but with @entity8 , it ’s nearly true			1
@entity9 combines agility , speed , a low centre of gravity and an eye for goal in an explosive package @entity8 's never - say - die attitude and his constant running are one of the @entity63 's many attributes both @entity8 and @entity9 are vital to their respective sides - but who will emerge victorious on sunday ? who would you rather have playing for you ? @entity69 : great question and one i really have to think about			1
i like to show @entity8 to my kids and encourage them to play that way — the desire he shows is incredible			2
he always wants to make things happen and i love that			0
but , if you ’re talking about both players at the height of their game , i think @entity9 would just pip it for me			1
there is hardly anything in it , and that ’s testament to how well @entity8 has done because i ’m a huge @entity9 fan			1
and @entity9 ’s finishing would give my team the edge — he is more decisive			2
@entity89 : i ’d tend to agree			0
@entity9 is up there with the best strikers we have ever seen in the @entity2			1
since arriving in this country three - and - a - half years ago , he has performed at a consistently high level , at least when he ’s not had injury problems			0
@entity8 has made a sensational start but it ’s still early days for him			2
many players take time to adjust to @entity98 , but @entity8 has already netted 18 times in all competitions @entity9 has a knack of scoring vital goals , as his stunning hat - trick against @entity104 showed who would you rather play against ? @entity69 : neither of them ! they would both be so difficult to mark but in different ways			1
in a way it might be slightly easier with @entity9 because you know where he ’s going to operate — in the six - yard box or within the width of the penalty area			1
@entity10 was as quick as anybody but i ’m sure he would n’t have fancied chasing after @entity8 ! @entity89 : definitely not ! even though @entity9 is the better striker , i would have backed myself to deal with him in my heyday			1
i would n’t have to change my set - up against @entity9 but @entity8 roams all over and does everything at incredible speed			1
you ca n’t run alongside somebody like that so the only way to deal with them is to take more gambles and get there early			0
as soon as he takes a touch , you have to be right there			0
it was the same with @entity134			0
in training i would sometimes be overly physical to try and stop him because if he won the ball in the first few strides he was away			0
it ’s the same with @entity8			2
@entity8 does everything at full pelt and would be a nightmare to mark , says @entity10 @entity9 is a poacher who operates largely inside the box , but @entity10 backed himself to deal with the striker what are there strongest assets ? @entity89 : they are both blessed with a hunger to win matches , but it is more obvious with @entity8			1
the fans love him because they see him chasing every ball and out - jumping players much bigger than he is			2
he works harder than anyone else and the harder you hit him , the more he tries			0
with @entity9 , he is so good at sensing defenders around him			2
that lets him lay the ball off , hold it up or turn and drive on			0
his close control is exceptional and he teases defenders , drawing them in before whipping the ball away			0
it ’s that sharpness that sets @entity9 apart			2
he is so explosive off the mark and i love watching him hold off defenders in the area			0
for @entity8 , he spent most of his time at @entity166 playing second - or third - fiddle , but now he is adored at @entity6			1
that ’s because of the way he puts opponents under pressure			0
lots of foreign stars join the @entity2 and wait for the ball to come to them			2
@entity8 goes out and gets it			2
@entity9 coolly beats @entity176 to display his acumen and awareness inside the penalty area @entity8 sidefoots home against @entity181 to show why he is one of the @entity2 's hottest properties do these two have any weaknesses ? @entity69 : with @entity9 , the only weakness is his injury record			1
that has to be a worry for him and @entity188 and i can sympathise			0
with @entity8 , it ’s hard to find a weakness and that ’s why he ’s idolised at @entity6			2
@entity89 : @entity8 is a fine all - round player but he does have a slight tendency to overrun things			1
at the start of his @entity6 career he would almost play too quickly and not release the ball at the right time to his team - mates			0
now he has ironed that out he is becoming hard to stop			0
who 's more valuable to their team ? @entity69 : @entity9 because his goals could win @entity5 the league			2
i ’ve said before it will be a shootout between him and @entity208 and i ’m not changing my mind			0
@entity8 is important for @entity6 but @entity9 can decide the destiny of the title			1
@entity89 : i think @entity8			2
people said @entity5 would crumble without @entity9 but they actually narrowed the gap on @entity214 when he was injured			1
they demonstrated they can cope without him but if @entity8 was out i think @entity6 would start to wave goodbye to a @entity216 place			2
so , who 's the better player ? @entity89 ’s verdict : @entity8 has always been used out wide but is now taking on the scoring responsibilities of the modern winger — think @entity221 or @entity222			1
he could be key as @entity6 try to become title contenders			0
but , as it stands , @entity9 ’s longevity and scoring record gives him the edge			1
@entity69 's verdict : it ’s such a close call			0
at their peak i would have to say @entity9 but if @entity8 keeps going at this rate we might have a different verdict in the future			1
@entity8 is currently unattached , after his recent split from @entity237 art director and designer @entity238 ( left )			2
@entity9 's girlfriend is @entity240 , a 28 - year - old @entity241 pop star ( right ) @entity242 : @entity8 this is almost impossible ! in terms of ability , finishing and technique it ’s hard to split them			1
but i ’ll go for @entity8 — he ’s injured less often and for the energy he gives			2
when you see your star player working that hard , you follow the example			0
@entity255 : @entity9 his hat - trick against @entity104 in the @entity216 was special			1
he also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against @entity260 to win the title for @entity5 in 2012			0
@entity8 has been brilliant but @entity9 is ruthless			1
@entity262 : @entity8 on current form , it would have to be @entity8 — not least because he can stay fit			2
@entity9 is the better finisher but he misses a large portion of games with injuries			0
@entity8 has set the @entity2 alight and offers his ability to play across the front			1
@entity271 : @entity9 close call but the @entity5 striker edges it due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances			1
no matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal , he finds a way			0
@entity8 has been shut out on a few occasions when @entity9 would have netted			1
@entity281 : @entity8 it 's close , because they are two brilliant footballers			0
but the @entity6 star is more of an all - rounder			0
@entity9 ’s game is about scoring goals — but @entity8 has been doing that and more since his arrived in the @entity2 this summer			1
so @entity8 — but only just			0
@entity289 : @entity9 when @entity9 is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable			0
at the start of the season before his injury in december , he was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as @entity221 and @entity294			0
@entity8 is a phenomenal player , but he is a level below @entity9 at 100 per cent			1
@entity296 : @entity8 @entity9 is the better player , yes , but @entity8 does it every week — he ’s never injured and has contributed to more than half of @entity6 ’s goals by scoring or setting them up			1
you never know when @entity9 is next set for a spell on the sidelines			0
@entity304 : @entity8 earned £ 30.3m last year — his @entity166 and @entity6 earnings supplemented by various business ventures in his homeland , @entity63 , including property holdings , stock investments , @entity311 restaurant chain , the @entity313 football team and @entity315 vodka			1
in 2011 , @entity9 signed the most lucrative sponsorship deal in @entity98 football with @entity318 — worth £ 5m			0
he also has an endorsement deal with @entity320 .			0

the @entity3 have taken the @entity2 by storm this season
both players scored in the 2 - 2 draw at the @entity326 in *september* and it is likely that they will have much to say when at the @entity328 on sunday
@entity9 is a lethal striker , who can run at people and is deadly in the box
@entity8 hit the ground running , scoring 12 times in the @entity2
but is the *quickfire* @entity241 or the *energetic* @entity63 the better player ?
@entity11 and @entity10 sat down to debate and decide ...
