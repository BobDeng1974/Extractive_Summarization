@entity0 's attorney @entity13 hit out at the renewed allegations , today pointing the finger at @entity16 for the latest scandal			1
' it is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover ( @entity16 ) resurfaces after it was fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities , ' he said in a statement to @entity23			1
' the one to blame for @entity1 's distress is neither @entity1 nor @entity0			1
' while @entity0 , who has consistently denied the allegations , has yet to personally respond publicly , his publicist @entity26 today said the director ' read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful '			2
' he will be responding very soon ... at the time , a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts , ' @entity26 said in a statement to @entity23			0
' the experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation ; that @entity1 had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality ; and that @entity1 had likely been coached by her mother @entity16			2
no charges were ever filed			0
' family scandal : soon - @entity45 and @entity0 made their ways to their vehicles on monday as heavy snow fell in @entity50 winter snow : @entity53 's adopted daughter @entity52 headed to school on monday all bundled up @entity1 thanked the public for their support after breaking her silence on the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her adopted father @entity0 , as the director 's lawyer accused @entity1 's ' vengeful ' mother @entity16 of ' engineering ' the sensational claims			1
' she 's really heartened by the response and support she 's getting , ' @entity11 , reportedly a friend @entity16 and her son @entity67 , told people			1
' she sends a big thank you to all those speaking up about sexual abuse and trying to break the silence			0
' however @entity1 , now living in @entity76 and using a different name , has not escaped criticism			0
some commentators have accused the 28 - year - old , who also goes by the name @entity83 , of cynically timing her accusations to thwart her former adoptive father 's chances of winning an @entity87 for his critically acclaimed film @entity88			1
family : @entity1 , who now lives under another name and lives in @entity76 , pictured with her husband on september 15 , 2012 break up : @entity1 with her parents @entity16 and @entity0 in 1987			1
the filmmaker claims his ex-partner coached their daughter into accusing him of abuse unsettling allegations : @entity1 , seen left with @entity0 in @entity100 in 1991 , and with her mother and sister in 1992 ( right ) , wrote how the director would stick his thumb in her mouth , force her to get in bed with him and place his head in her naked lap public break - up : around the time this picture of @entity0 , @entity1 , little @entity112 and her brother @entity113 was taken in 1992 , the actress and filmmaker split following the revelations of sexual abuse @entity1 's first - person account marked first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse which was said to have occurred in the 1990s			1
in gut - wrenching detail , @entity1 wrote in her statement how at age seven , her adoptive father , @entity0 , allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house			1
' he told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother ’s electric train set , ' @entity1 recounted			1
' then he sexually assaulted me			2
he talked to me while he did it , whispering that i was a good girl , that this was our secret , promising that we ’d go to @entity139 and i ’d be a star in his movies			0
' she noted that to this day , she finds it hard to look at toy trains			0
@entity1 went on to describe how the award - winning director of ' @entity147 ' and ' @entity144 ' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like , including sticking his thumb in her mouth , forcing her to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap. ' i thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters			1
but what he did to me in the attic felt different , ' she said			0
unable to keep her alleged encounters with her father secret anymore , young @entity1 went to her mother , asking her if her own father used to do the same things to her that @entity0 was doing			2
the girl 's explosive allegations put an end to @entity1 and @entity0 's relationship in 1992 , setting off a legal battle in which @entity1 claimed the filmmaker accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking that he had assaulted her			1
what followed next was a drawn - out process in which @entity1 was dragged from one psychologist to the next , recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying			0
in the end , @entity0 was denied visitation rights with his children , but a @entity182 prosecutor declined to charge him , saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court , he was dropping criminal proceedings due to @entity1 's fragile state			1
@entity0 , 78 , has always denied the allegations of sexual abuse			2
he was never charged with , or convicted of , a crime in this case			0
hit back : @entity0 has again been forced to deny claims he abused @entity1 keeping a low profile : @entity0 was accompanied by a retinue of people , but he sought to avoid drawing attention to himself @entity199 fan : filmmaker @entity0 , left , leaves late in the fourth quarter of an @entity202 basketball game between the @entity203 and the @entity204 saturday @entity207 after @entity0 and @entity1 's split , it was revealed that the filmmaker began an affair with his adopted daughter soon - @entity45 , whom he married in 1997			1
on saturday night , just hours after the release of his daughter 's bombshell letter , a somber - looking @entity0 was spotted arriving at a @entity204 game in @entity50 with two of his other adopted daughters in tow			1
in her open letter , @entity1 claimed that @entity0 used his ‘ sexual relationship ’ with her stepsister , soon - @entity225 , to cover up the abuse @entity1 herself had allegedly suffered at his hands			2
‘ that he got away with what he did to me haunted me as i grew up , ’ miss @entity16 wrote			0
‘ i was stricken with guilt that i had allowed him to be near other little girls			0
’ @entity1 candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her later life , including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at being touched by men			0
the woman also said she began cutting herself			0
his other girls : @entity0 exits @entity241 with adopted daughters @entity242 and @entity52 after watching the @entity204 lose to the @entity203 scandalous relationship : @entity1 accused her father of using his affair with his adopted daughter @entity225 , right , to cover up his abuse of her ; the two married in 1997 @entity1 also used her soul - baring confession to attack the @entity252 establishment for ' turning a blind eye ' and helping along @entity0 ’s career in the entertainment industry			1
‘ @entity256 found it easier to accept the ambiguity , to say , “ who can say what happened , ” to pretend that nothing was wrong , ’ she said			0
‘ actors praised him at awards shows			0
networks put him on tv			0
critics put him in magazines			0
final straw : @entity1 explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another @entity87 nomination for his latest film , @entity88 ‘ each time i saw my abuser ’s face – on a poster , on a t - shirt , on television – i could only hide my panic until i found a place to be alone and fall apart			1
’ @entity1 's decision to offer a first - person account of her torment has been spurred by @entity0 's latest nomination for an @entity87 and last month ’s @entity290 ceremony , where he received the prestigious @entity291			1
‘ it felt like a personal rebuke , like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away , ’ @entity1 wrote			2
@entity1 , who described herself as a happily married woman , did not shy away from condemning the actors who have starred in her father ’s films over the years , some of whom were on hand january 12 to present @entity0 with his @entity290			2
‘ what if it had been you , @entity310 ? or you , @entity311 ? you knew me when i was a little girl , @entity312			0
have you forgotten me ? ’ she asked			0
@entity1 's family , including her mother and stepbrother @entity67 , have been unwavering in their support of her			1
on the night of the @entity290 ceremony , @entity67 , @entity0 's would - be son , brought up his sister 's alleged assault in a scathing tweet			2
support system : both @entity1 's mother , actress and activist @entity16 ( left ) , and her adopted brother @entity67 ( right ) , have stood by her claims regarding @entity0 strong words : @entity53 's son and ex-girlfriend were n't happy about him receiving an honour at the @entity290 ‘ missed the @entity0 tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity147 ? ’ the newly hired @entity334 host wrote			1
@entity1 concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie - going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father			2
‘ so imagine your seven - year - old daughter being led into an attic by @entity0			0
imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name			0
imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter			0
‘ are you imagining that ? now , what ’s your favorite @entity0 movie ? ’ shaming stars : @entity1 lambasted actors like @entity312 and @entity362 who had starred in her father 's film ; @entity365 was on hand last month to present @entity0 with a lifetime achievement award			2
