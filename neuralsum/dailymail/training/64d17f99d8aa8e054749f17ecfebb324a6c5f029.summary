' the pictures we have seen can be read as trying to reach an international audience , but also a domestic one , reinforcing the idea that the country is strong in light of a potential @entity4 or @entity48 aggression			2
' the @entity18 regime is still quite young , and though @entity1 has had a string of successes recently with its rocket launches , @entity18 's military credentials are very slim and he still remains to be seen as a military leader			0
' the @entity4 and @entity48 has also just signed a new military plan yesterday that would provide for a joint military response in case of @entity1 provocations			2
' this leads to an interesting point , as conventional deterrence theory would say the @entity4 would protect @entity48 in case of war , but here we are dealing with small provocations			0
' it seems to me that both the @entity4 and @entity1 as well have a very clear understanding of first - use of military might , and that any aggression is understood as being potentially leading to a nuclear strike			0
' the @entity4 has the capabilities , and @entity1 has bombs , so it is unclear whether or not they could actually launch them in a reliable fashion			0
' finally , any movement made by the @entity4 – be it reinforcing its missile defence in light of a potential @entity1 threat or conducting joint drills with @entity48 – will be exploited and framed by @entity1 as being aggressive moves , which they to some extent are , as in this particular game the @entity4 is protecting their strategic interests and @entity1 is protecting theirs			0
