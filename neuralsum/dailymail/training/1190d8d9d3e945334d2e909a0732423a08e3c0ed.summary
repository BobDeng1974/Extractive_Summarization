many women in their 70s are cleaning people 's homes or local offices , or sitting behind the tills at their local supermarket more than 300,000 people who are aged 70 and above have a job , with many blaming the fact they are too poor to stop working , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the ballooning number of older workers highlights a social revolution in @entity15 with people forced to work at an age when many assume they would have stopped years ago			1
the figures , compiled exclusively for the @entity20 by the @entity21 , shows 193,000 men and 111,000 women are still working at the age of 70 and over			1
the @entity25 ’ @entity26 warns the majority are ‘ ordinary , working - class people who are having to take jobs because they ca n’t make ends meet any other way			1
’ a spokesman added : ‘ anecdotally , they are not exactly doing jobs like becoming the governor of the @entity36			0
’ the @entity21 ’s research also reveals a clear gap between the types of job that older men are doing compared to those that women are doing if they are still working in their sixties			1
for older men , the most common jobs are managers , directors and senior officials			1
for women , they tend to do more low - skilled jobs , such as being a cleaner or a secretary			2
it comes as a report , also published by the @entity21 , shatters the traditional dream of retiring at the age of 65 with a comfortable pension and dreams of foreign travel			1
in reality , many women in their 70s are cleaning people ’s homes or the local offices , or sitting behind the tills at their local supermarket			1
more than a third of men and nearly a quarter of women ‘ stopped working after the age of 65 ’ , it said			1
while the majority work part - time , around a third of people who are still working after state pension age are ‘ employed full - time ’ , according to the @entity21			1
at present , a man reaches state pension age when he is 65 and a woman currently reaches state pension age at the age of 61 and six months			0
but both these ages are being increased			0
by 2020 , the state pension age for both men and women will be 66 , rising to 67 by 2028 – and it will keep on rising to 68 and beyond			1
for many pensioners , it is a positive choice			0
they enjoy their job , find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age			0
but many others are being forced into working – or even going back to work after retiring – because they simply can not afford to stop			0
the self - employed make up a greater proportion of the workforce post-retirement than pre-retirement ( left ) , while the retirement age has been steadily rising since the turn of the century a @entity98 spokesman said : ' given more of us are living longer , it 's important people can choose to work for longer and fund their retirement			1
' that 's why we made it illegal to sack someone just because they reached the age of 65			2
' @entity108 , chief executive of @entity109 , a recruitment website for people over the age of 50 , said he is ‘ absolutely sure ’ the trend of people delaying their retirement will increase			2
he said : ' we asked people if they will have to work beyond the age of 65 to enjoy a comfortable retirement			2
nearly 70 per cent of people said " yes "			2
' it comes as just a third of private sector workers are saving into a company pension			0
of those who have one , it is typically worth just £ 26,000 , which buys an annual income of just £ 850			0
graph showing the rise of older workers since the mid- 1980s new rules forcing bosses to pay into a pension for their workers are designed to stem the growing pensions crisis , with up to 11million workers being ‘ auto - enrolled ’ into a pension			0
but a separate report , from the insurance firm @entity136 , found 37 per cent of private sector workers will opt out and refuse to save into a pension			0
it warned the success of the government ’s scheme ' hangs in the balance as many workers focus on making ends meet in challenging economic times '			0
the @entity147 warned @entity15 is ' miles off course when it comes to saving enough for its old age '			0
last night , a @entity98 spokesman said : ' we have said we expect around a third of people to opt out of automatic enrolment			2
' our ongoing advertising campaign is achieving high levels of awareness among employers and individuals of the need to put something aside so they can afford a decent quality of life in retirement			0
