rail minister @entity0 has been accused of being a ' hypocrite ' after it emerged she travels to @entity3 by car - despite praising @entity6 's ' comfortable ' rail services and ' fair ' prices			1
miss @entity0 travelled from her @entity9 constituency to @entity10 68 times last year - driving on all but two occasions			1
in total , the @entity13 rising star claimed back £ 2,689 in expenses for almost 6,000 miles in the car			1
even if miss @entity0 takes the train from her constituency of @entity19 , @entity9 , she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of @entity23 into @entity10			1
@entity0 celebrates being promoted to junior transport minister after leaving @entity25 in @entity27 's reshuffle last month out of the two commutes she made on the train last year , one was in first class - for which she claimed £ 91 back in expenses , the @entity29 newspaper reported today			1
earlier this week , miss @entity0 sparked fury by insisting rail passengers pay ' fair fares for comfortable commuting '			1
yesterday it was revealed that next year ’s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent			1
fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since @entity27 came to power in may 2010			0
the worst - hit commuters will have to oay up to £ 200 extra for season tickets from january			1
but miss @entity0 said : ‘ what we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers – who could be forgiven for saying : ‘ what on earth am i getting for these rises that i ’ve seen over the last decade ? ’ – start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting			1
’ general secretary of the @entity58 rail union @entity56 said : ‘ not only is @entity0 guilty of insulting millions of rail passengers , she ’s now found to be a hypocrite			1
’ a spokesman for ms @entity0 said last night : ‘ @entity0 often drives from her constituency due to personal circumstances			2
however , she regularly uses the train and completely understands that people ’s journeys can too often not be good enough			2
’ and ms @entity0 yesterday insisted on @entity66 that she meant fares ‘ should be ’ fair			2
commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to @entity70 at @entity71 , south @entity10 miss @entity0 's comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday			1
@entity75 , 47 , a marketing director , said : ‘ i would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to @entity77			0
‘ it ’s not comfortable at all			0
at peak times i ’m lucky to get a seat			0
’ @entity80 , 47 , a nurse from near @entity82 , said her experience was ‘ horrendous ’ , but still costs £ 240 a month			0
she said : ‘ i find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service			0
‘ i ’ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it ’s really like			0
i do n’t think she ’d call it comfortable then			0
’ another commuter , @entity93 , 51 , said the transport minister needed ‘ a reality check ’ if she thought the railways offered good value for money			0
the company secretary , who gets a 5am train to keep down the £ 400 a month cost of his commute from @entity103 to @entity77 , said : ‘ the only reason i use the trains is because i have no choice			2
if they want us to pay more they need to improve the services			0
‘ it ’s just not good enough			0
if the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check			0
’ rail fares will soar by up to 5.5 % in january - and by an average of 3.5 % - following this morning 's announcement that @entity122 inflation was 2.5 % in july the annual increase in train fares is linked to july ’s inflation figure , published this week by the @entity126 , plus one percentage point			1
with the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month , this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in january 2015 , although some increases could be even bigger			2
the chancellor @entity132 could soften the blow , and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of @entity122 but no more			0
but in a @entity137 interview yesterday , miss @entity0 dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive			1
@entity141 transport secretary @entity140 said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 when asked whether it was fair that a @entity10 to @entity145 ticket can cost £ 160 , she said this was ‘ only if you do n’t book in advance ’			1
in fact , the popular @entity150 website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to @entity154 costs £ 164 to travel today			2
if booked a fortnight in advance , it is only £ 23 cheaper to travel at the same times			2
questioned on @entity161 ’s today programme @entity159 insisted : ‘ people do n’t just rock up to the station , like probably you and i do , and pay the maximum amount			0
’ the proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes , minimal rises or even cuts in wages			0
for example , the cost of a season ticket to @entity10 for commuters from @entity176 is expected to jump by around £ 150 a year to around £ 4,455 , according to the @entity178			1
this is the pressure group ’s estimate of what the cost will be – although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year ’s fares			2
@entity188 of the @entity178 said : ‘ if your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary , or you ’re a part - time worker with no choice but to pay for a full - time fare , or you ’re stuck with creaking 30 - year old diesel trains , or even if you ’d just like a seat in return for your £ 5,000 season ticket , then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable			1
’ @entity140 , @entity198 ’s transport spokesman , said : ‘ this is shocking complacency from yet another out - of - touch @entity13			0
many passengers facing inflation - busting fare rises do n’t even get a seat on their train to work , let alone “ comfortable commuting ”			1
‘ when you go through that every single day , the experience is not a good one			0
’ the @entity207 said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015 , but a spokesman added that the department was ‘ looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard - working people ’ .			0
