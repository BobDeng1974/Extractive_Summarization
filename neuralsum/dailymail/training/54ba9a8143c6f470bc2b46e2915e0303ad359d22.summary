@entity8 , 60 , shot @entity9 , 44 , with a semi-automatic pistol at close range in a barn on the farm they once shared in rural @entity15			2
their marriage was already on the rocks when mrs @entity19 , who had two sons and two daughters with the defendant during a 20 - year relationship , started seeing another man , @entity24 , 40			1
guilty : @entity8 , left , has been jailed for shooting his wife @entity9 with a a semi-automatic pistol @entity19 discovered the couple ’s affair six days before he killed mrs @entity19 , @entity27 heard			1
he said he heard voices in his head in the moments leading up to the death			0
@entity19 admitted manslaughter on the grounds of a ' loss of control ' because he was taking anti-depressants at the time , which he said had an impact on his thought process			1
senior medical professionals were divided on whether the dosage @entity19 was taking was sufficient to cause his behaviour on the day he shot his wife			1
it took the jury nine and a half hours to acquit the property developer , of @entity50 , @entity51 , near @entity52 , north @entity15 , of murder but guilty of manslaughter			1
crime scene : the incident happened at the couple 's home - higher @entity50 in @entity51 , in @entity15 passing sentence , mr @entity58 said he was ' wholly unimpressed ' with the evidence that @entity19 had been affected by the prescription medication he was taking at the time			1
' you have been convicted of the manslaughter of your wife and you have pleaded guilty to the possession of a prohibited weapon , a semi-automatic pistol , ' the judge said			1
' there is no evidence that you were violent towards your wife until the day you killed her and indeed no evidence that you threatened her with violence			0
' you were convicted of manslaughter and you had in fact pleaded guilty to that offence once it was added to the indictment			2
' you killed your wife without any justification			0
your conviction for manslaughter is on the basis that when you killed your wife you had lost your self - control			2
' this was a terrible tragedy			0
it is a tragedy for @entity19 , whose life you took , and for her family			2
' a precious life has been needlessly lost and the sentence i am about to impose is in no sense a value of that life			0
' her life was precious and you have taken it from her			0
sad : the court hear the couple 's marriage was already on the rocks when mrs @entity19 , started seeing another man , @entity24 , 40			1
pictured the front gate to the family home			0
' but my sentence is also informed from my view of the evidence placed before the jury and my assessment of what happened that terrible day			0
' it is clear that in the days before the killing you learned that your wife was going to leave you and make a new life with mr @entity24			1
' you loved her and accepted the situation as best you could			0
it is evidently clear that you became concerned about mr @entity24 upon hearing of the rumours and what your son had told you			0
' you became obsessed with the view that mr @entity24 was a paedophile and that your young daughter was going to live with your wife			2
' it was false in the extreme but i am satisfied it was a view you genuinely held			0
' the judge said @entity19 had not lost his self - control when he took the handgun from its hiding place , cleaned it , loaded it and placed it in his pocket to meet his wife on the day he killed her			1
' in my view you had probably intended to threaten your wife , ' he said			0
' you were not out of control when you recovered the gun , you were not out of control when you cleaned it and you were not out of control when you put it in your pocket			0
happier time : pictured mrs @entity19			1
the judge said it was clear that in the days before the killing mr @entity8 learned that his wife was going to leave him and make a new life with mr @entity24 ' you took out the loaded gun and pointed it at her			1
you were not , in my judgment , out of control even though you were in a highly charged emotional state			0
' but she laughed at you and you did lose control and pumped five bullets into her at point blank range			0
' the judge said that had @entity19 been convicted of murder the starting point would have been 30 years in prison			1
' in my judgment the degree of provocation was low and your wife presented no threat to you , ' he said			0
' you acted out of anger and frustration rather than fear			0
it is clear that your intention when you discharged that weapon was to kill your wife			0
' i take into account your conduct immediately after you killed your wife , your lack of previous convictions for violence and your remorse , although how much of that is self - pity is difficult to assess			0
' @entity19 showed no emotion as he was told he would serve a 12 - year sentence for manslaughter to run concurrent with a five - year term for possessing the gun			2
the judge explained that the 296 days @entity19 had already served in custody would be taken into account and he would spend half the sentence in prison before being released on licence			2
in mitigation , @entity190 told the judge of @entity19 ’s genuine remorse			2
' we can not add to the facts of the case but we would like to emphasise the defendant ’s evidence , the intention to commit suicide and , of course , his comments made to the police , which were of loving his wife , wanting to die and wanting to be with her , ' he said			0
' we say it was immediate and genuine remorse			0
' the trial heard that @entity208 and mr @entity24 started their affair in june last year , having known each other for three years			1
the following month , mr @entity24 , a builder , moved into a converted barn at the @entity215 ’ farm and continued seeing mrs @entity19			1
when the defendant found out about his wife ’s affair , she left their home and moved in with mr @entity24			1

' mr @entity24 heard arguing and screaming , then a gunshot and then further gunshots			2
' the court heard that mr @entity24 told his two sons to run to a neighbouring house to raise the alarm and he then ran to the barn			1
as he did so , the defendant came out of the barn with the gun in his hand			0
the jury heard that @entity19 pointed the gun at mr @entity24 and said : ' it should have been you first			1

when @entity19 was arrested , he told police : ' i did it			2
she would just not listen			0
' i shot the woman i loved because she did n’t do what i wanted			0
' he also told the court he said the @entity272 over his wife ’s limp body , before trying to kill himself , though the weapon had no further ammunition			2
members of mrs @entity19 ’s family were not in court to see her husband jailed although they attended the trial			1
yesterday , a spokesman for her family said : ' no - one has the right to take another person ’s life			0
' we , @entity9 ’s family , feel disappointed and that justice has not been done for such a terrible thing that @entity8 has done to our wonderful daughter , sister and friend to so many people			2
