@entity0 is n't just the leading nominees for best actress at this year 's @entity3 - she 's also helping to design the backstage green room			1
@entity5 , which has been the official sponsor of the luxurious space since 2003 , announced today that the @entity8 star will consult on the room 's look and help choose furniture and decor for the celebrity enclave			2
the 54 - year - old actress , who is nominated in her category alongside the likes of @entity17 and @entity18 , will use her own experience of ' what it 's like to be backstage on @entity3 night ' in order to ensure that the stars - only hangout comes complete with every comfort she and her fellow celebrities might need			1
firm favorite : after picking up both a @entity29 ( @entity30 ) and a @entity31 ( r ) for her role in @entity8 , @entity0 is believed to be a shoo - in for this year 's @entity3 multi-talented : in the movie , ms @entity0 , 54 , plays a linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early onset @entity35 it is not the first time that ms @entity0 has worked alongside the magazine ; in 2012 , the garden of her home in @entity43 's @entity42 was featured in the publication , with writer @entity45 waxing lyrical about the actress ' design talents			1
' had she not become an actress , @entity0 could definitely have been a decorator , and a successful one at that , ' he wrote			2
' furniture , design , construction , renovation , and all manner of zhuzh - these are her obsessions			0
' last year , the prestigious honor of decorating the green room was given to @entity3 winner @entity60 , who worked alongside renowned architect @entity61 in order to transform the spaceinto a five star retreat for every famous face who stepped out on the stage throughout the night , be it to collect an award , or to present one			0
ms @entity60 , 68 , curated a digital collection of @entity3 - themed images , which were showcased in the space throughout the ceremony			0
ultimate luxury : last year 's space featured a digital display of @entity3 - themed images design team : oscar winner @entity60 teamed up with architect @entity61 in order to design 2014 's green room this year 's room will see ms @entity0 collaborating with @entity84 - based design collective @entity82 , however little else is known about what they have planned for the design			1
no doubt the multi-talented mother - of - two is hoping that she will get the opportunity to enjoy a celebration inside the space ; having snagged both a @entity31 and a @entity29 for her role in drama @entity8 , ms @entity0 is , unsurprisingly , the firm favorite to be awarded the best actress gong at this year 's ceremony			1
it is the fifth time that ms @entity0 has been nominated for an @entity3 , having been pipped to the post in both the best actress and the @entity102 categories in 2002			2
but despite her seemingly unstoppable wins at this season 's award ceremonies , the actress admitted that she was stunned to have received another @entity3 nod			0
' thank u everyone for the congratulations ! ' she tweeted just minutes after she was named by @entity110 and @entity3 president @entity111 in @entity112			0
' i am so happy i can barely breathe # makingmyselfdizzy # @entity3 '			0
