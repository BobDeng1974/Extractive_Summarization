a police sergeant has set a new @entity2 record for the deepest unaided dive after swimming to depths of 230ft without any equipment			1
sergeant @entity6 , 43 , did not use oxygen , flippers or goggles for the dive and held his breath for over two - and - a - half minutes to claim his place in the record books			1
the former @entity14 from @entity15 , @entity16 , out - dived the competition at the @entity18 , a 430ft deep underwater cave in the @entity20 off @entity21 , @entity22			1
record breaker : sergeant @entity6 dived a lung - busting 230ft underwater without breathing apparatus , flippers or goggles sergeant @entity6 has only been a competitive free - diver for the past two years , focusing on the challenging ' constant weight no fins ' category , which prohibits divers from using any methods of propulsion			1
@entity6 first set the @entity2 record in 2011 when he set a depth of 203ft obliterating the previous 180ft record , then went one step better in 2012 diving to 216ft			1
this time his record - breaking dive was so deep his lungs squashed to around an eighth of their usual size as he hit the lowest point			2
@entity6 , a response sergeant with @entity46 , said : ‘ ironically , i actually did n't think it was going to be a good dive at the time			2
preparing : sergeant @entity6 during his pool meditation , a method of training which saw him hold his breath for over two - and - a - half minutes during the dive there and back again : sergeant @entity6 managed to get down to 230ft after which he had to return to the surface without any help up , up and away : @entity6 held his breath for an incredible two minutes and 35 seconds to claim the deepest unaided dive ever by a @entity61 at the @entity18 cave off the coast of @entity21 , @entity22 ‘ i got my warm up all wrong , the surface was rough and i was getting chilly before the start of the dive			1
' sergeant @entity6 , who has set his sights on the @entity69 record of 291ft , added : ‘ my descent was not a comfortable one - i was n't relaxed at all			1
' i was wondering whether i had set myself too much of a challenge			2
‘ we put our bodies under a huge amount of physical strain and a dive can easily go wrong if you 're not well prepared			0
‘ thankfully i managed to get to the bottom marker and that changed everything			0
i knew at that point the record was in the bag because my ascents are always strong			0
uncharted waters : sergeant @entity6 's record - breaking dive was so deep his lungs were compressed to an eighth of their usual size ‘ in stark contrast to the descent , the ascent was beautiful - i had 75 seconds to just think and take in the beautiful underwater scenery			1
i was gasping once i got to the top but it was a great feeling			0
’ @entity6 added : ‘ my plan now is to go deeper			2
by next year i 'd like to be hitting depths in the late 80s			0
‘ my ambition is to break more records , and within the next 18 months i want to make an attempt on the @entity69 continental record , which currently stands at 291ft			0
‘ there is only one person who has dived deeper than this - the current world record holder @entity108			0
‘ the rest of us are playing catch up			0
