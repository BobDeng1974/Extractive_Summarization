by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:28 pm on 3rd november 2011 many thousands of fatal illnesses could be avoided in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 - if they would only adopt the diet of their @entity9 neighbours			1
as many as 80 per cent of preventable deaths from the biggest killer diseases would be eliminated if the rest of the @entity14 followed @entity9 's nutritional habits , according to new research			0
but experts say that this does not give the @entity9 ' bragging rights ' , as even they are not eating a very balanced diet			1
perhaps best not to follow the dietary habits of @entity23 ( pictured in a scene from the comedy with long - suffering wife @entity26 ) given researchers found people in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 consistently eat more calories , more fat and more salt than those living in @entity9 they have proposed a ' fat tax ' to improve the diet of the @entity14 as a whole and reduce regional inequality in health			1
the research showed that people in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 consistently eat more calories , more fat and more salt than those living in @entity9 , and fewer fruit and vegetables			2
eight out of 10 unnecessary deaths from cancer , heart disease and stroke in @entity4 and @entity5 - and four in 10 of those in @entity3 - could be prevented if people ate the ' average ' diet in @entity9			1
analysis of diets between 2007 and 2009 found that , on average , people in @entity3 and @entity5 also ate 7.5g of salt daily compared to 7g in @entity9 , while those in @entity4 ate 7.4g			2
@entity53 increases blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and stroke			0
those in @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity4 also ate more fat and saturated fat and less fruit			0
people in @entity3 ate about 951g of vegetables a week , while those in @entity5 ate 902g , compared to the higher 1,190g in @entity9			0
experts from the @entity62 and the @entity63 in @entity64 also looked at 10 cancers associated with diet , including those of the gullet , bowel , and stomach			0
they noted that death rates for heart disease , stroke and cancer are higher in @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 than they are in @entity9			1
calculations showed that between 2007 and 2009 , just under 22,000 more people died in @entity4 , @entity3 , and @entity5 from stroke , heart disease and diet - related cancers than would be expected if death rates were as low as in @entity9			1
@entity81 to head : are fish and chips really more healthy than haggis and chips ? over the period , 3,005 deaths in @entity4 , 6,353 in @entity3 and 1,890 in @entity5 could have been ' delayed or averted ' if the @entity9 diet was adopted , the study found			2
the authors concluded : ' diet has a substantial impact on geographical variations in mortality from coronary heart disease , stroke and various cancers within the @entity14			0
' they said identifying ' fiscal initiatives aimed at increasing the cost of foods high in saturated fat ( so called " fat taxes " ) may be best placed to reduce geographical inequalities in health if they are paired with subsidies for fruit and vegetables			0
' people in @entity3 ate about 951g of vegetables a week , while those in @entity5 ate 902g , compared to the higher 1,190g in @entity9 @entity110 , senior dietician at the @entity111 , said : ' this research is n't about bragging rights to the @entity9 or tit - for - tat arguments about how healthy our traditional dishes might be			1
' saying the rest of the @entity14 should follow @entity9 's lead to cut heart deaths is n't a foolproof solution - a quarter of @entity9 adults are obese and only 30 per cent eat their five - a - day			0

death rates for heart disease , stroke and cancer higher in @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 than @entity9
but experts say it does not give the @entity9 ' bragging rights ' , as even they are not eating a very balanced diet
