by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 it was not a rigid formation in attack for @entity4			1
in particular @entity5 drifted from the left into the middle and was a threat when on the ball			0
@entity10 would go out wide and his pace scared @entity12 at times			1
@entity13 would drop back if he needed to			0
it was more like the @entity4 of old , and for the first 60 minutes as good a performance as any this season given the calibre of opponent they were up against			1
this was the all - conquering @entity12			1
maybe @entity4 do not need the massive overhaul that has been suggested			1
they looked a good side			1
it was a brave fight			0
@entity36 ’s goal was a thunderbolt struck because he sensed blood at the start of the second half			2
@entity12 responded like champions and it was @entity36 who allowed @entity44 to steal in for his header			2
i was very impressed with @entity48 , there now looks to be a future for him at centre - half ; which is a positive from an @entity54 point of view			1
it was a big call by @entity23 to play @entity48 in place of @entity57 but it worked			2
he looked dominant in the air – and beat @entity59 to a commanding header early on – and also coped well in one - on - ones with @entity61 when dragged to the wing			2
he was mobile and used the ball well			0
steppingup : @entity48 ( right ) tussles with @entity59 as the centre back covered admirably plus point : @entity67 ( centre ) has shown promise at right back this season @entity67 was another plus point at right back			1
@entity23 will have to play at least one of the youngsters , perhaps both , with @entity73 and @entity57 leaving in the summer			0
this will have been an important experience for both of them and given them confidence			0
conversely , @entity20 and @entity79 did not look comfortable at times in possession			0
@entity82 likes to play out from the back but when questioned by @entity4 ’s high pressing they would often go back to @entity85			2
i was disappointed with @entity12 , it was not as difficult for @entity4 as we would have expected			1
usually in wide positions they have carousel of players and the full - backs bomb forward			0
but @entity94 and @entity95 played very central , they came right in to central midfield			0
it was underlapping rather than overlapping			0
that made it easier for @entity4 to work out who should be picking up who			2
over-tinkering : although @entity104 ( right ) scored , he will have been frustrated with @entity12 's system game - changer : the introduction of @entity108 ( left ) gave @entity12 added impetus and gave them better shape it might be because @entity82 wanted @entity95 on ball more often , and it also meant @entity114 and @entity59 could push further forwards			1
but instead they looked ordinary ; it just did n’t work			1
it ’s a system that would drive someone like @entity104 mad			0
he loves short passes with his full - back to cut in and find space in dangerous areas , but there was little chance of that			0
there was no - one running down the wings to create width			2
it seemed a case of @entity82 over-tinkering			0
when @entity108 came on to provide width , @entity12 looked a different side .			1

the first 60 minutes was as good a performance as any from @entity4 this season
there looks to be a future for @entity48 at centre - half
@entity12 looked ordinary with a lack of width
