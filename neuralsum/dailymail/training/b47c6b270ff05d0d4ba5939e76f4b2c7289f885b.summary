the great ones leave the deepest memories ; we recall @entity3 unfolding a cross-court backhand or @entity5 persuading a languid late cut between slip and gully , each stroke a small miracle of timing and imagination			2
at their best , they seemed to be playing a different game from the rest			0
then , quite suddenly , the magic dissolved and they became human once again			0
as he approaches his 39th birthday , @entity18 may be undergoing that same , sombre transformation			1
@entity18 has struggled desperately for form over the past couple of years as he combats injuries @entity18 was sick and is in last place heading into the final round of his comeback tournament his summer form was woeful , having returned too soon from back surgery			1
he missed the cut five times in eight tournaments , and retreated to rehabilitation in august			0
but the start of his comeback in @entity35 , @entity36 , on thursday was an extended nightmare			2
it started with a tee shot hooked into a neighbouring swimming pool , featured a smattering of stubbed chips , and ended 77 shots later			0
he was furious , of course , and seethingly frustrated to have finished the opening day in last place , four shots behind the field			2
the 38 - year - old has struggled throughout the tournament as he looked to re-capture his once dominant form but that is his form , and his only answer is to work harder , concentrate more fiercely and pray that the game which once came so naturally will cease to resemble an impenetrable mystery			1
as for the rest of us , it does no harm to remember just how stunning his golf used to be , and the cavalier fashion in which his victories were achieved			0
for a time - indeed , for a long time - he appeared almost invincible			2
the statistics tell their own tale : four masters , four @entity71 pgas , three @entity72 and three @entity73 for a total of 14 majors			1
at his dazzling peak , he was quite untouchable			0
but the game , just like every game , has a way of taking its revenge , and now he struggles like a mortal where once he strutted like a god			0
yet here â€™s the strangest thing : in his travails , @entity18 seems more sympathetic , more human , somehow more admirable than ever he did when the living was easy , and glory followed him down every fairway			1
@entity18 has won 14 majors during his career , including the @entity90 at @entity91 in 2000 ( pictured )			1
