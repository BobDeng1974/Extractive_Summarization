he is the billionaire bondage fanatic fanning the flames of lust in women across the globe			0
a large part of @entity7 's allure no doubt comes from the fact that readers are able to conjure up their very own fantasy figure as they read the @entity7 trilogy			1
but now , as plans for a @entity16 version of @entity7 get underway and casting begins for the man who will play this most sensational of roles , thoughts have turned to just what this magnetic mystery male should look like			2
the face of @entity7 ? an academic has used descriptions and image - generating software to create the so - called first picture of the protagonist of @entity30 's novel @entity7 ahead of the big reveal , scientists have come up with their very own version of @entity7 - created using the same e-fit software used to catch criminals			1
they have today revealed what they are dubbing the ' first picture ' of the @entity7 protagonist , who previously only existed inside the imagination of the reader			2
using the e-fit software employed in police investigations they strived to put a face to the mysterious character at the centre of millions of women 's fantasies			1
they created the black - and - white image - which shows a man with tousled hair and high cheekbones - based on descriptions of how women imagined him to look			2
the handsome composite was the brainchild of @entity59 's ( @entity59 ) dr @entity58 , who said the man in the image had drawn comparisons with famous actors and sports stars			1
she took the descriptions from 12 female readers ' to create the striking image			2
the inspiration : the e-fit was created using the eyes of @entity72 , left , and the jawline of @entity74 , right the e-fit academics were inspired by @entity79 's face shape and jawline when they created the image , and right , a young @entity76 's lips were put forward as women 's fantasy feature @entity85 star @entity72 's eyes were cited as those women thought @entity7 might have , while @entity74 's famous chiselled jawline was used to help create the fantasy @entity7 's face			1
dr @entity89 said : " while we do n't want to intrude on anyone 's fantasies , based on a small sample of women , this is the image of @entity7 they have in their heads when reading the novels			1
' personally , i think he 's quite handsome , although everyone 's interpretation will be different			0
' it was just a bit of fun , but it does show the quality of image we can now generate			0
' most of the descriptions drew comparisons with famous film stars , which may help @entity16 moguls when the film remake comes to casting			0
' one fan , @entity114 , 24 , from @entity115 , @entity116 , said : ' i think it 's better if it 's left to women 's imaginations rather than a computer - but it still pretty clever			0
@entity7 of fantasy : the e-fit , made from combining a list of 12 famous faces , has echoes of @entity129 star @entity128 , left , and right , rugby star @entity130 real life @entity131 ? the computer generated image of @entity7 has drawn comparisons with model @entity136 , left , and right , @entity139 rugby star @entity138 ' it 's not the image i have of him in my head , but he 's very good looking nonetheless			1
' the e-fit , the result of a combination of 12 famous faces , looked strangely familar , drawing comparisons with former @entity149 rugby captain @entity130 , and fellow rugby playing peer and ex-partner of @entity152 , @entity138			1
others thought the e-fit bore more than a passing resemblance to @entity156 , thanks to the full lips , and @entity128 of @entity129 for his chiselled jaw and classic good looks			0
model @entity136 earned a mention , as did fellow model @entity162			0
author @entity30 ' first book in the trilogy has sold ten million copies world - wide becoming the fastest - selling novel of all time - outselling @entity168 's @entity167 and even @entity171 's @entity170 books			0
last week an academic warned that @entity173 faces a surge in baby births next year because the raunchy trilogy is driving women into bed more than ever before			0
realising her dream : @entity7 author @entity30 will see her characters come alive as plans for a @entity16 version of her global bestseller get underway hair : @entity187 / @entity74 ( in ' the @entity188 ' ) / @entity189 eyes : @entity72 / @entity191 / @entity192 ( as @entity193 ) face shape : @entity79 jaw line : @entity74 / @entity79 nose : @entity197 lips : @entity76 / @entity199			2
