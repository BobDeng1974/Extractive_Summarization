by @entity1 reporter published : 19:32 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 13 april 2013 for @entity4 ’s first woman tenant , this felt like home from home			1
in early 1992 , mrs @entity7 moved to spacious new offices in a fine @entity10 house in @entity11 , @entity12 , where her combined sitting room and study was arranged to look very much like the working space she ’d had at no. 10			1
she worked in a high - backed chair by the fireplace , looking at papers with the help of a huge magnifying glass — she wilfully refused to wear reading glasses — underlining , marking marginalia , gathering odds and ends together in files , and then forgetting where she had put them			1
the room was dominated by an extraordinary portrait of her by a @entity33 artist , which she liked because it made her look very thin and intellectual			1
her staff hated it and referred to it as @entity40			1
warmth : this picture with the @entity43 and the @entity44 was proudly displayed in mrs @entity7 's home dotted around were busts of @entity47 , @entity48 and her husband , @entity49			1
a rather unnerving bronze impression of her own hands , sliced off at the wrists , perched on a ledge			2
bowls , dishes and statues were frequently moved around as the fancy took her			2
she needed no help with this , being immensely strong in the arms			2
there was not a stuck window or jammed door she could not shift — and , being impatient , she would sometimes use this strength in disregard of her personal safety			2
she would go out onto the balcony at home to force open the @entity70 windows , presenting herself obligingly profiled for any sniper			2
in her office , her desk and cupboards were stuffed with pamphlets and photocopied articles and speeches			1
when in search of ideas , she would get down on her knees and rummage through them			2
a glass - fronted bookcase was full of her favourite volumes , selected for inspiration rather than continuous reading , which she rarely practised			0
she preferred to dip into books and extract whatever she found useful in them without worrying too much about what the author ’s conclusions actually were			1
in her handbag , she always carried around a tiny volume of extracts from @entity48 ’s speeches and broadcasts			1
many of her most heavily thumbed books were of poetry : @entity101 ( naturally ) and @entity102			0
she was over-fond of quoting , not realising that what she herself had to say was more noteworthy			0
she became enthralled by a book of sayings from @entity108 presidents and was annoyed when @entity49 threw it out with the rubbish — by mistake , or so he claimed			0
she was not modest about her achievements , and the offices were packed with memorabilia of past glories and triumphs — @entity118 and @entity119 summit photographs , watercolours of @entity121 and scenes from the @entity124 campaign			1
@entity125 : @entity7 pictured in 1992 at the @entity126 yet the offices still had a distinctive femininity			0
every week , a friend sent beautiful flowers whose perfume filled the air , adding to mrs @entity7 ’s own , for she wore a heavy scent , usually @entity133			1
at home in @entity135 , she displayed rows of snuffboxes , together with silver , china and photographs			1
she was particularly fond of one showing her with the @entity43 and the @entity44 at @entity141			0
she got on much better with the queen than is frequently imagined , albeit with greater warmth in her last years			0
but she had greatest regard for the @entity44 , who reciprocated it			0
on one wall of the sitting room was a painting by @entity149 — her former minister , and a talented artist — of @entity4			0
a mixed bag of other paintings of different styles , some surprisingly risqué , adorned the entrance hall and bordered the staircase			0
in these surroundings , year by year after leaving office , she worked at an immense pace to further her ideas and to advance @entity162 interests overseas — no one was ever more effective at securing a contract for some @entity162 firm than @entity7			0
needless to say , she neither sought nor received any benefit from doing so .			0

she *thrived* on living in and amongst memorabilia of her past glories and triumphs , *including* @entity119 summit photographs and watercolours of @entity121
a tiny volume of extracts from @entity48 ’s speeches and broadcasts were *permanently* in her handbag
