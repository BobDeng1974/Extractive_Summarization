a woman astounded doctors after she turned up at hospital with a football - sized tumour on her neck which weighed two kilograms			1
@entity6 , 79 , had been living with the tumour - thought to be the largest ever reported in the @entity8 - for an incredible 20 years			1
mr @entity9 , the ear , nose and throat surgeon who removed the tumour during a five - hour operation at @entity16 , said it was the largest growth he 'd seen during his 20 - year career			2
scared : @entity6 , 79 , lived with the football - sized tumour for 20 years before it was removed			1
surgeons have now confirmed it was the largest lump to have been removed from a head or neck in the @entity8 mrs @entity6 , from @entity25 , near @entity16 , @entity26 , said she had n't realised the size of the tumour until doctors showed it to her in a mirror			1
she said : ' i know i should have done something sooner about the tumour , but i was n't in any pain and , i am ashamed to say , i was afraid to go to the doctors about it			2
' now though , i would n't hesitate to see a doctor about anything , and would encourage people who may be experiencing health problems of any kind to get help right away , because the people at the hospital are fantastic			2
' my husband @entity48 , our nephews and nieces were all worried when the lump started getting bigger			0
skill : ear , nose and throat surgeon mr @entity9 ( right ) , removed mrs @entity6 's tumour during a five - hour operation at @entity16 ' i could cope with it when it was small but over the years it just grew and i suppose in the end i feared the worst			1
' then on october 13 , mr @entity60 insisted his wife saw a doctor when the growth started to bleed			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' i saw mr @entity9 before @entity65 , and he was wonderful			1
he showed me the photos of the side view of the lump which i had not seen before			0
it was at that point that i realised just how bad it was			0
' i was frightened of having the operation , but actually everything was fine			0
they took two biopsies and although i do need further treatment , i 'm just so glad the lump has gone			0
' i plan to get back to being normal again , buy some new clothes and enjoy life			0
she added : ' the operation has given me a new lease of life as i can go out now without worrying about people staring at me			0
relief : mrs @entity6 ( with husband @entity48 ) said : ' the operation has given me a new lease of life as i can go out now without worrying about people staring at me ' ' the staff at @entity16 were marvellous and i ca n't thank them enough			1
' mr @entity9 said : ' in the whole of my 20 - year medical career , i can honestly say that i have never seen or treated such a massive tumour			0
' the operation itself was quite challenging and i am happy with the outcome and that the operation was a complete success			0
' the greatest challenge was to prevent the side of @entity6 's face from becoming permanently paralysed , which we successfully prevented			2
' i have since found out that @entity6 's lump is the largest to have been removed from somebody 's head or neck at @entity16 and @entity111 and the largest ever reported in @entity8			1

@entity6 , 79 , finally had the tumour removed after it started bleeding
doctors say it is the largest head or neck tumour to be removed in the @entity8
mrs @entity6 said she put off *seeking* treatment because she was scared
removed growth is now being tested and she may need further treatment
but mrs @entity6 says she is delighted that people no *longer* stare at her
