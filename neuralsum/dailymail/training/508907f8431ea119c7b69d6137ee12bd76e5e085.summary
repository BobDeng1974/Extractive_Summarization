by @entity1 reporter published : 11:07 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 23 july 2013 a 57 - year - old deaf woman heard her baby granddaughter laugh for the very first time with the help of a cochlear implant while cameras rolled on the today show			1
as @entity10 watched this morning , @entity11 , of @entity12 , @entity9 had her implant activated for the first time and , as if on cue , her one - year - old granddaughter giggled with excitement			1
it was a monumental moment for @entity11 , who has suffered from hearing problems since childhood and had gone completely deaf in the last five years			2
grandmother : 57 - year - old @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity9 got a cochlear implant three weeks ago and it was turned on for the first time on the today show miracle : as if on cue , @entity11 's granddaughter giggled just as the implant activated , which was the first time she ever heard the one - year - old laugh ‘ i 'm hearing her ! @entity32 ! she was laughing , i think , ’ @entity11 told her audiologist @entity29 as host @entity30 stood by with @entity11 ’s family on today			1
though @entity11 correctly identified her granddaughter ’s laughter , there was no way to know if the implant would work as cameras rolled			1
‘ it 's noise ... noise , ’ is how @entity11 described the sounds at first			1
then , @entity41 turned the volume up on her implant			2
questions : cameras were rolling , but as @entity11 waited for her implant to activate , she did n't know how well , if at all , it would work success : thankfully , as today host @entity30 and her whole family watched , the implant worked and @entity11 heard her granddaughter 's giggle ‘ i 'm hearing you			1
i 'm even hearing me ! i 'm hearing me talk , ’ said the thrilled @entity11			2
before getting the implant , life had become a lot less exciting for @entity11			1
ever since childhood , she ’d had hearing problems			0
hearing aids helped her get by in school and even allowed her to become a special education teacher			0
however , as her hearing become fainter over the last few year , it became harder to work and to interact with other people			0
fortunate : miraculously , her granddaughter 's laughter was one of the first things @entity11 heard ‘ so , i zone out , ’ she said			1
‘ and go into my own little world			0
’ in that world , @entity11 loved to enjoy nature and watch the birds in her back yard			2
@entity75 , she could never hear any of it			0
‘ you know , the creaks in your house , the baby crying , ’ @entity11 said before the implant was activated			1
‘ different sounds that you take for granted , and i 've never heard ' em. ’ and now she has , thanks to the cochlear implant she received three weeks ago at the @entity88			0
high - tech : @entity11 wore hearing aids for years , but they 'd stopped working in recent years			2
advanced cochlear implants , pictured , are implanted within the ear itself , with a microphone - like device worn outside the head the microphone and processor worn on the outside are connected to implements that stimulate the bones inside the ear the implant is made up of a receiver and stimulator implanted on the bones inside the inner ear			0
they connect to a magnetic transmitter work on the outside of the head which acts as a microphone			0
as the audiologist turned on the implant , she explained that the technology will continue to improve , even in the minutes following the activation			0
how good her hearing will become remains unknown , but @entity11 will be happy just hearing the birds in her yard			2
‘ do i expect miracles ? no , ’ she told today			0
‘ i just want to hear better			0
’ small wonder ? @entity11 says she does n't expect miracles , she just wants to hear things like the birds and the wind in her back yard and more laughter from her granddaughter			1

@entity11 's *grandaughter* giggled as cameras rolled and her family and @entity30 stood by on today
experts were n't sure how well or *quickly* the implant would work
