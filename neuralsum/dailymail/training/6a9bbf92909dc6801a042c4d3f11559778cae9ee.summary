it does come around quickly			2
there will have been under five weeks between @entity2 lifting the @entity3 in @entity4 and @entity5 kicking off the new @entity7 season			1
in a sense not a lot has changed since @entity10 clawed back the title in may			2
@entity13 's attempts to retain their crown hinge on an ability to keep @entity16 , @entity5 , @entity17 and @entity18 at bay			1
@entity20 will typify prickle , @entity23 's counsel should remain intact			2
five men , however , are hoping that 2014/15 is the campaign when everything alters for the better			1
there is a quintet who 've starred this pre-season for their respective clubs and may be ready to spring a surprise after being firmly thrust the tag ' flop ' previously			2
find the net : @entity36 has four goals in two pre-season games over in @entity39 for @entity13 yes , notching during meaningless friendlies against varying opposition is n't a definitive barometer as to how individuals will perform come the first week of the season , but @entity45 takes a look at a few who may fancy themselves on august 16			1
@entity36 ( @entity13 ) ' i have said before that @entity36 is a very important player for us , and he proved again what an asset he can be , ' @entity10 said after @entity36 scored twice against @entity17 over in @entity39 this week			1
and the @entity54 is right - here is a striker with real pedigree			2
it 's the reason why @entity13 spent £ 22million on the front man this time last year and why , despite his chronic injury problems , they are willing to stick by him			1
while @entity36 will be the first to admit he does n't score enough goals - although it 's four in two games for him in the @entity66 - there is a certain flicker of added life he brings on the edge of the box			0
@entity10 ended that press conference @entity71 by saying : ' if he 's fit all the year , he will be a very important player for us			1
' if a line summed up a player 's situation , it was that			0
at 29 , the argument most prevalent is that this is a winger to have wasted his talent and coasted after sir @entity90 paid @entity91 more than £ 15million for him in 2011			1
but there is a sense that @entity94 has sent a rocket in @entity85 's direction , with the @entity98 international indicating against @entity99 that he has more intent from wide areas and is n't afraid to take his man on inside or out			0
crucially @entity85 has been smiling in @entity39			0
it 's not often over the last two years you 've been able to say that			0
a happy winger is one who will frighten full - backs			0
point to prove : @entity85 scored twice against @entity99 for @entity5 this week no worries : new @entity5 boss @entity94 is the sort of manager who is able to get the best out of @entity85 @entity79 ( @entity18 ) it was difficult not to feel sorry for poor old @entity79 during his first term in @entity116 football			1
plucked from @entity117 after scoring 10 goals in @entity119 - that 's two , not the top division - he immediately became a figure of fun with a gangly style and apparent lack of goalscoring inclination			0
but this is a man who is only 21 , and one with next to no knowledge of competing in a premier division at that			0
the four goals against @entity133 over the weekend , therefore , will do him the world of good			0
the @entity136 clearly knows where the net is			0
they were the finishes of a striker who may have a say for @entity18 off the bench if nothing else this year			2
no more @entity144 ? man of the people : @entity18 's @entity79 could be ready to prove observers wrong at the @entity148 not a bad start ! @entity150 scored four times against a hapless @entity133 in a friendly on saturday afternoon @entity153 ( @entity154 ) a healthy portion of @entity158 ' @entity157 - induced bumper transfer kitty of 2013 was spent on a striker who seemingly could only take penalties			1
so it seemed , and that is n't an unfair conclusion to draw from a first year littered with missed chances , head - dropping and sulky frowns			2
but one thing has always remained constant with @entity154 fans : they are willing to back @entity153			1
and why on earth not ? this is the same front man to lead @entity171 's line for three goal - laden years and who commanded £ 26million			2
that , the @entity175 side felt , was his market value at the time			0
it is with some encouragement then that he is back among the scorers during this pre-season with two against @entity183 - albeit a young side after the seniors had been given a thorough hiding by @entity187 in the @entity188			0
he is laying on for others and puts in more work that given credit for			0
@entity193 may just get the best from him yet			0
a new man ? @entity153 has looked more threatening for @entity154 under @entity193 lead : @entity196 is hoping for @entity198 goals @entity196 ( @entity198 ) that goal			1
@entity202 away , circa 2007			0
@entity196 , during his only cap for @entity98 , robbed @entity205 a goal by pouncing on his effort - that was going over the line - to steal unwarranted glory			1
in fact , that split - second decision did n't fare particularly well for @entity196 in the ensuing years			1
he was seen as a bit of a joke and poster boy for the ill - fated reign of @entity217 as national boss			0
but those assumptions are a touch unfair			0
@entity196 is , and has always been , a very competent striker at the top end of the @entity223 with the potential to ruffle @entity7 feathers			1
now under @entity226 at @entity198 he should spearhead their attack ( even with the overpriced @entity229 having signed from @entity230 )			1
while the @entity202 goalhanging is what he may forever be remembered for , a deft outside of the boot beauty against @entity235 - which went viral on the internet - is more in tune with what the @entity239 striker is capable of			0
remember this ? @entity196 scored a ridiculous solitary goal for @entity98 away in @entity202 seven years ago			1

@entity5 and @entity13 hoping stars improve this year
@entity196 could be key for @entity198
@entity153 must show why @entity154 paid £ 26m for him
