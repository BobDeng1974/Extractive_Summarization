@entity0 has apologised after a horror - themed colouring book featuring gruesome pictures of blood , knives and screaming victims was marketed at children as young as five			1
the book , called @entity9 ! ! , features graphic drawings to colour in taken from famous horror films , including the man with nails in his head from @entity15 , the woman holding a knife by her face from @entity19 , and a straitjacketed @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity23 @entity22 came across the 16 - page book while he was searching for a birthday present for his seven - year - old grandson , @entity26			1
good present for a five - year - old ? @entity0 thought so , but has now apologised and removed it from sale the colouring book features drawings from 18 - rated horror films such as @entity15 - this is the villain , @entity31 the blurb on the back cover says the book contains ' really scary stuff ' and ' more blood than you can shake a dagger at '			1
inside , there are line drawings of iconic stills from terrifying 18 - rated films aimed at adults , including @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 and @entity47			1
mr @entity22 , 56 , of @entity48 , who found the book on @entity0 's website , said : ' it was advertised as being suitable for kids from five to eight - i do n’t think so			1
' it is unbelievable that they can sell such a thing aimed at kids			0
i do n’t think i have to say why it ’s unsuitable , that much is obvious			0
' who on earth are they employing that thinks this is ok ? ' a @entity0 spokesman said the product was placed on the company ’s website by the book ’s publisher			1
he said : ' we have very clear guidelines for third - party sellers who list items on our website , and are sorry that on this occasion they were n’t followed			0
fatal attraction : the moment when @entity80 puts a rabbit belonging to her lover 's child into boiling water child - killer @entity85 from @entity86 , left , and the eponymous @entity46 covered in pigs ' blood ' we will be speaking with the seller to remind them of the importance of selecting the right category when listing products with us			1
' of course when issues do arise we act quickly with the seller to ensure that the item is updated with the correct information			0
' but @entity99 , founder of @entity100 , said retailers had to ' take responsibility and help parents and schools in the difficult job of protecting our children and allowing them to retain some innocence in childhood			1
' she added : ' protecting our children from violent and sexual imagery is almost impossible in this digital world and those who believe it is just “ down to the parents ” only have to look at this example to see that			0
' however much we block internet porn at home , or refuse to buy overtly sexy clothing , there is always another leak springing up round the corner			0
' this book is a gruesome find and yet it is easy to imagine it arriving by post as a gift from a caring grandparent who knows his or her grandson likes ' baddies ' without having seen the content , as it is positioned as suitable for children			2
' the book ’s publisher , i love @entity138 , insisted the product is aimed at adults - despite a slogan on the book ’s cover describing it as ' the @entity146 colouring - in book for good colourer - inners ( as well as beginners )			2
the infamous scene from @entity45 in which @entity150 hacks through a bathroom door is in the book the stuff of nightmares : an @entity155 is one of the horror films featured @entity47 , which tells the story of a dystopian nightmare in a future society , is also pictured @entity161 , who runs i love @entity138 , said her book was designed for adults rather than children			2
she said : ' firstly and most importantly , my products are not aimed at kids			0
they are a contemporary , pop - culture inspired range that are aimed at playful grown - ups			0
' i was unaware that @entity0 were a stockist as a separate distribution company deal with the wholesale of my products			0
' the front cover features a drawing from the horror movie @entity179 , in which a woman is stabbed to death in the shower			0
' i believe that this one image is a fairly large clue that this is not a book aimed at children			0
' however , it does state on @entity0 ’s website that my products are aimed at five to eight year olds , which is an error on their part			2
' the product has now been removed from @entity0 ’s website			2
terrifying : the book contains drawings featuring knives @entity20 in a straitjacket in @entity21 and @entity200 's childcatcher , right the classic shark film @entity202 is pictured in the book - you can colour in the shark 's teeth and its victim 's bikini			1
