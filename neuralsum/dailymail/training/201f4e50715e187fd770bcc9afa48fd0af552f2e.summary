his @entity4 @entity3 , which was off its leash , killed a little terrier called @entity8 the owner of a dog which mauled a tiny @entity11 to death in front of its owner and horrified bank holiday shoppers said it may have mistaken the smaller animal for a squirrel			1
nightclub promotions manager @entity0 , 30 , was jogging through @entity22 's popular @entity21 area with his large @entity23 , which was n’t on a lead , when it pounced on 18 - month - old terrier @entity8			1
privately - educated @entity0 immediately ‘ rugby - tackled ’ juice and wrestled her to the ground but @entity8 's horrific injuries meant she had to be put down by vets soon afterwards			1
@entity0 left the scene but not before @entity8 ’s owner @entity31 , 24 , had taken a photo of him on her mobile phone			1
at @entity38 ’ @entity34 yesterday @entity0 , who had pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control , expressed extreme remorse at what had happened			1
the court heard how he had adopted the two - year - old dog after he discovered he was being kept in a muddy cage in a neighbour ’s garden in @entity46 , @entity22			2
@entity0 , whose family own great @entity47 and @entity48 as well as horses , was trying to integrate the dog back into society when it suddenly grabbed little @entity8 in its jaws - despite juice having no history of aggression			1
district judge @entity57 acknowledged the defence ’s argument that @entity54 could have been following her ‘ natural animal instincts ’ to pounce on a smaller animal , when ordering @entity0 to pay @entity8 ’s owner @entity61 £ 1,700 compensation			1

owner @entity31 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , was devastated by the loss he was also ordered to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work and must ensure that @entity54 always wears a muzzle in public and is kept on a lead			2
sentencing , mr @entity57 said : ' you considered the convenience of yourself and the animal instead of the safety of others when you let it run free alongside you			2
' it led to significant injury to the owners of the dog and of course the dog , which lost its life			0
the owners are victims because they lost a pet which they treat as a member of their family			0
' @entity8 's owners quickly took this picture of @entity0 immediately after the attack @entity0 fled the scene of the attack on bank holiday monday , may 6 , at about 4.45pm			1
his solicitor @entity96 claimed that @entity54 was becoming agitated as horrified shoppers began shouting when they saw @entity8 ’s bloodied body emerge from the jaws of the larger dog			1
however , @entity0 handed himself in to police when a picture of him with the dog taken by @entity61 was circulated by the media			1
a statement from @entity61 read out by prosecutor @entity106 , said : ' @entity8 was on a lead which was attached to a harness around her back			2
she was so small that we put her in the harness so we could pick her up if we needed to			0
' as i approached the @entity113 pub i was aware of something brushing past me			0
as i looked around i could see that a much bigger dog was attacking @entity8			1
' i started to scream then i saw the owner of the other dog tackle her to the floor			2
i could tell @entity8 was alive but i could see a lot of blood			2
' miss @entity31 asked @entity0 for a phone number and described him as ‘ cagey ’ when he handed it over - she said it later turned out to be false			2
but mr @entity96 said @entity124 had given her his personal mobile number which he was unaware had been terminated because he usually used his work handset			0
@entity0 , who has no previous convictions and a first class degree in design from the @entity130 after studying at @entity132 school in @entity133 , now lives in @entity134 with his parents			2
mr @entity0 said his dog juice may have mistaken the smaller animal for a squirrel miss @entity31 said : ' i started to scream then i saw the owner of the other dog tackle her to the floor			1
i could tell @entity8 was alive but i could see a lot of blood ' mr @entity143 added : ' it ’s very important to emphasise the fact he as a dog owner is deeply upset			1
' when he was told about the dog ’s death he was very upset			0
' the history of his own dog juice is that he took the dog on after having adopted it from people who neighboured him			1
it was kept outside in muddy conditions so he took it on 18 months ago			0
his family have labradors and @entity160 and he is used to having big dogs			0
' the dogs all socialise together and @entity54 plays with the family ’s children , it ’s a family pet			0
he takes the dog out when he goes jogging			0
' the reason the dog was off its lead is that normally the dog jogs alongside him			0
the difficulty when he runs through town is that the dog sometimes runs around lampposts and it can become tricky			0
' after the attack he could n’t have done a great deal more than he did			0
he has taken every step he could to intervene			0
' as soon as he knew the police wanted to speak to him he made himself available			0
