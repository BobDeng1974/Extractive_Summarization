@entity0 thanked @entity1 for making him a better manager as he collected the @entity4 's @entity3 on behalf of the rehabilitated @entity6 striker			1
after an exceptional season , the 27 - year - old topped the poll of 300 - plus journalists ahead of team - mate @entity11			0
@entity1 netted 31 goals in a remarkable campaign that not only saw @entity6 come agonisingly close to a first league title in 24 years but saw the striker put the negative headlines of the past behind him			1
@entity1 , who was also named the @entity36 , was unable to pick up the award on thursday due to a @entity39 break , so @entity6 boss @entity0 instead accepted the award			1
' on behalf of @entity1 and all of @entity6 's staff , we want to say a big thank you to the @entity4 , ' he said at the @entity45			1
' i think everybody knows the struggles he had in the last year			0
it has been incredibly difficult for him			0
' but rehabilitation is always respected in the country - people who want to change for the better and he is certainly someone that was at a real low point at the end of the last season			2
clean sweep : the striker added the @entity62 award to his golden boot and @entity23 gong finish : @entity1 's goals took @entity6 to the brink of the @entity68 title , before they lost out to @entity69 ' i know that better than anyone			1
it was a real , real difficult period for him but he went away and , after a difficult summer , the power of @entity6 and the club that it is convinced him to stay			1
' once we got the season under way , he concentrated on his football and we 've had a number of outstanding players this season but @entity1 has been incredible			1
' @entity0 used the speech to thank former manager @entity87 for signing @entity1 , @entity6 's communication team and managing director @entity89			1
first and foremost in the @entity92 boss ' praise , though , was @entity1 , whose performances this season saw them come so close to the title			1
' when i came into @entity6 as manager , @entity99 and @entity11 said to me this was the best player that they had played with , ' @entity0 added			2
' i thought about those two and all the great players they 've played with in their career , so i was really interested to see what his play was like close up			0
' for me , he has challenged me every day of my life , he 's done everything that you would need to do at the top level of the game as a player			0
infamous : the @entity6 striker 's reputation was in tatters when he bit @entity34 last season tears : failing to win the title will haunt @entity1 , but he has been the best player in the league all year ' he is a winner , his determination is unique , he is absolutely relentless			1
he is someone that trains every single day of his life - he does n't look for an excuse			0
' and what people do n't see is that he is a very intelligent man			0
he is a winner when he crosses the line , but with great intelligence			0
' for a young manager like myself coming into a club like @entity6 , i understand the pressures of the club and those pressures include everything that involves managing top players			0
' i know for however long i am at @entity6 , whenever i leave i will have become a better manager and a better person because of @entity1 and for that i thank him so much			2
' @entity1 was also praised on stage by @entity145 chairman @entity144 and @entity4 chairman @entity146 of the @entity147			2
' there are some members that remind quite frequently that in the citation for this award that it mentions he is @entity155 by ' precept and by example ' , ' the latter said			0
example : @entity1 has earned the award because of his incredible performances and improved behaviour ' now that part of the citation is important , but i do think what better example is there of someone who maybe realised that they did have issues to address on the field of play and has addressed those issues ? ' i think @entity1 has done that and i think that is why he fulfills that criteria			2
' and , of course , there is that bit that says ' @entity155 ' and what a footballer he is , what a footballer we 've had the privilege to watch , particularly this season			0
