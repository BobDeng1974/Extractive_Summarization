hundreds of mysterious golden - coloured orbs have been found buried in a hidden chamber deep beneath the @entity2 in @entity3			1
the discovery was made by archaeologists from the @entity6 , who admit they have no idea what the spheres are for			1
a tiny robot called @entity12 , which has been scanning tunnels deep beneath the famous temple , found the orbs using infrared scanners			1
archaeologists have no idea what the spheres would have been used for , although believe they may have been involved with religious rituals the @entity12 is named after the @entity38 god of rain			1
it is three - feet - long and can squeeze through tight spaces and explore small , hidden areas			2
it is fitted with video cameras and a mechanical arm used to clear obstacles out of its way			0
it is part of a robotic system called @entity51 , which includes a large rover that carries the two smaller robots			2
once the @entity51 arrives at a chamber , the robots break off and scan the area using infrared scanners			1
a separate flying drone captures video footage			0
they were hiding in a previously unexplored ancient chamber at the end of a stretch of 2,000 - year - old unexplored tunnel on the @entity22 site , near the @entity66 @entity67 , an archaeologist on the dig said : ' they look like yellow spheres , but we do not know their meaning			1
it ’s an unprecedented discovery			2
' the spheres are made of clay and range from 1.5 to 5 inches in circumference			1
they get their yellow colour from a material called jarosite			2
lead archaeologist @entity82 explained that the spheres appear to be made of metal because jarosite is formed by the oxidation of pyrite , which is a metallic ore also known as @entity28			1
the walls in the chamber were also found to be dusted in pyrite , which gave it an appearance of a gold room			1
the archaeologists therefore think that the orbs would have been used by ' high - ranking people , priests , or even rulers ' to perform rituals within the tunnels			1
although , the team admit what part they played in these rituals , and what these rituals meant remain a mystery			2
the team from the @entity104 have been using the robot for months to explore the tunnels under the celebrated temple , also known as the @entity19			0
explorer : this robot may have made a momentous discovery in a 2,000 - year - old tunnel in @entity3 the was the first image transmitted by the robot deep under the ancient temple famous : the social structure of @entity22 remains a mystery after nearly 100 years of archaeological exploration at the site @entity120 means ' the place where men become gods '			1
the site is thought to be a burial ground			0
the @entity22 people worshipped eight gods , and were known to carry out human sacrifices			0
the ancient city was founded 2,500 years ago and was once one of the biggest cities on @entity131 with over 100,000 residents - @entity131 at this time only house 200 million people			0
the city was totally abandoned in 700 ad and very little is know about the civilisation , or what caused the mass exodus			0
the temple lies about 37 miles north of @entity23 and the site houses the remains of the @entity21 city of @entity22 in the @entity142			0
it is best known for the towering @entity144 and the @entity145 earlier this year , the team and the remote - controlled robot found three unexplored passages			2
it was only expected to find one			0
the discovery of the hidden passages and golden orbs could be highly important			1
in 2010 experts said a tomb discovery would be significant because the social structure of @entity22 remains a mystery after nearly 100 years of archaeological exploration at the site			2
when the civilisation was abandoned , almost 50,000 high - value objects including jade , stone , shell and pottery , such as ceramic beakers , were thrown into the tunnel because it was closed up			0
the remote control vehicle is equipped with a video cameras and a mechanical arm to clear obstacles out of its way as it maneuvers through the tight passageway tourists look on at the archaeological area of the @entity178 about 37 miles north of @entity23 this map shows the chambers of the tunnel , found beneath the @entity182 , as plotted by the laser scanner			2
archaeologists were only expecting to find one chamber , but the robot discovered three hidden rooms no depiction of a ruler , or the tomb of a monarch , has ever been found , setting the metropolis apart from other pre-hispanic cultures that deified their rulers			1
vertical excavations begun in 2009 to reach the mouth of the tunnel suggest this was a ruler 's tomb , claims @entity82			0
' i think the tunnel was the central element , the main element around which the rest of the ceremonial center was built , ' @entity82 said			0
' this was the most sacred place			0
' ' there is a high possibility that in this place , in the central chamber , we can find the remains of those who ruled @entity22 , ' he added			0
archaeologist @entity82 from the @entity216 explains the developments to the media the robot is seen near the entrance of a tunnel in the archaeological area			0
after months of exploration it might have made a momentous discovery			1

hundreds of yellow spheres have been found scattered in hidden chamber
@entity3 archaeologists admit they have no idea what the orbs are for
drones and robots made the discovery using infrared scanners
