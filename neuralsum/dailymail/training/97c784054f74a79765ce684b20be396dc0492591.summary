@entity5 ( pictured with husband , @entity14 ) conceived the triplets , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , after her third and final cycle of @entity6			1
she says she was terrified that her body would not be able to cope with carrying three babies so she started eating three portions of meat a day to increase her intake of iron , vitamin b12 and protein to improve her chances of a healthy pregnancy			1
mrs @entity5 , who had never eaten meat , tucked into chicken , bacon and sausages every day and at 35 weeks gave birth to identical boys @entity17 and @entity16 and daughter @entity18			1
naturally slim , she piled on more than five stone gorging on chicken , bacon and burgers as well as a daily @entity41 's breakfast and a sausage and egg @entity43			0
her meat cravings became so strong she was tucking into three portions of meat a day with a @entity49 chicken and stuffing salad sandwich her favourite snack			2
the high protein diet carried her pregnancy through to 35 weeks when she gave birth to identical boys @entity17 and @entity16 , and daughter @entity18			1
mrs @entity5 's first attempt at @entity6 had to be abandoned because her ovaries became dangerously swollen			1
she conceived after the second cycle but had a miscarriage when she was eight weeks pregnant when she was pregnant with the triplets , mrs @entity5 decided to ditch her vegetarian diet to give herself the best chance of a successful pregnancy			1
she started craving meat and ate three portions a day ms @entity5 , a pa from @entity67 , said : ‘ when the sonographer found a third heartbeat i remember shouting “ oh no ” and crying - thinking i 'd lose them all			2
‘ after losing one baby to a miscarriage , i thought i would never be able to carry three			0
‘ but then my hunger kicked in and despite never eating meat , i craved it			0
i ate about six meals a day			0
‘ it all seems like a blur now			0
i just remember the cravings were so strong that i would wake up in the night and make my husband go and get me a @entity41 's			0
mrs @entity5 said that her meat cravings became so strong that she had to get her husband , @entity14 , to go out and buy her @entity41 's and @entity84 - sometimes in the middle of the night during the pregnancy , mrs @entity5 put on five stone			1
she says that her favourite snack was a @entity49 chicken and stuffing sandwich ‘ several times my husband had to go up to @entity84 for chicken and chips with me			0

’ ms @entity5 was diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovaries which doctors told her would stop her getting pregnant			2
thanks to her high protein diet , mrs @entity5 carried the triplets until she was 35 weeks pregnant			1
they were then delivered by c - section			0
@entity17 and @entity16 are identical mrs @entity5 had both polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis and doctors believed this would prevent her conceiving as both conditions can cause infertility endometriosis is a condition which causes cells from the lining of the womb to develop outside of the uterine cavity			1
it causes pain and , often , infertility			0
polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects how a woman 's ovaries work			0

during the third @entity6 attempt she got ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but decided to proceed at her own risk and two fertilised eggs developed			2

since then mrs @entity5 and mr @entity180 , 34 , a finance manager , have gone through 8,000 nappies and done more than 10,000 feeds			2
medics believe mrs @entity5 ’s protein boost will have contributed to her successful pregnancy			1
