and as police scientists sift through the bloodied sheets , pillows and other items of clothing stained with dark red blotches , the @entity2 has been able to confirm exclusively that 19 - year - old @entity17 's claims that she is pregnant are true			1
a report from the prison hospital in the @entity1 capital , @entity21 , has revealed that the young woman who will soon be officially charged with the murder of her mother , 62 - year - old @entity25 socialite @entity24 , is expecting a child			2
with the sun beating down on the police yard , the scene was surreal , with the taxi into which the suitcase containing the body of mrs @entity17 was loaded , parked there with two bloodied pillows lying on its roof			1
on the ground behind it was the silver coloured suitcase , it â€™s ' priority luggage ' label stained with blood , in which the body had somehow been crammed			0
items of clothing were spread out on the ground and many appeared to be stained with blood			0
policeman from @entity54 on the @entity77 resort island of @entity1 , look through the suitcase where the body of @entity43 was found stuffed inside a stone ornament was aslo found in the suitcase , but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter mrs @entity17 remains unclear , as a police said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill her there was also what appeared to be a stone ornament , but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter mrs @entity17 remained unclear today , as a police source had said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill the woman who was well known in social circles in the @entity25 , having once worked with @entity96			1
also on morbid display were what appeared to be two pairs of jeans and an unidentifiable yellow and red cloth item which appears to be the same item that @entity104 is seen wearing in a still from a cctv camera focused on the hotel lobby either before or after the murder			0
the grim task for forensic officers was being carried out today as @entity77 began celebrating tomorrow 's ( @entity112 ) @entity111 celebrations			0

horror : the blood - stained suitcase where the body of mrs von @entity146 was found			0
