@entity1 , 26 , is keen to begin training again - just weeks after he appeared weeping in court charged with the death of @entity17 and despite facing a murder trial			1
@entity1 pictured on a running track for the first time since shooting of girlfriend @entity17 the @entity23 newspaper showed a photo of the athlete on the running track - nearly three months after he shot his girlfriend dead the @entity29 - language @entity23 newspaper printed the image of what it said was @entity1 on the front page of its thursday edition			1
in the photograph , the double amputee is seen from some distance wearing his blades and dark lycra running clothes and is walking on a track with his hands on his hips			1
the newspaper said the photo was taken on march 24 by a high school student visiting the @entity47 , where @entity1 ' regular practice facility is			1
it was the first time @entity1 had put his blades on since he shot dead @entity17 in his home his agent , @entity52 , said , but it was not a training session			1
@entity1 was only ' having a jog around the track , ' the agent said , as the newspaper claimed sources had told it the @entity61 400 - meter runner and @entity63 champion had begun full training on march 21			1
mr @entity65 disputed that and said neither he nor @entity1 , @entity1 ' coach and the man who controls his training sessions , were present at the track on the day the photograph was taken			1
@entity17 , girlfriend of @entity72 's @entity61 sprint star @entity1 , was shot dead by the athlete on @entity5 the single photo , a grainy image taken through a metal fence showing @entity1 walking on the far side of the track , was accompanied by a front - page story under the headlines ' @entity1 is back on the track ' and ' in training with other athletes			1
' but while @entity1 was n't yet in a training routine , his return could be any day now , his agent said			1
' he was just having a jog around his track on his own accord			2
he was n't back at training , ' mr @entity65 said			2
' that picture was taken by a schoolkid on march 24			0
@entity94 , @entity1 and his coach had a meeting on tuesday to discuss him getting him back to training			1
' based on that he told us he would like to get back in training and we can now look at formulating his training schedule			0
' he is finding it very difficult and he is still coming to terms with the sad loss of @entity17			1
that is why it will be better for him to be back at training			0
it will be great to get him back to the track and get some routine			0
that 's why we are taking it day by day			0
' while a return to training might be on the cards for @entity1 , who holds several @entity117 titles over 200 metres , 400m and 4x400m , @entity65 revealed there is currently no plan regarding his competitive return , if he is invited to compete			1
@entity1 appeared at the @entity121 in @entity122 and is set to face a murder trial - an accusation he strongly denies the athlete , who claims he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder , is reportedly keen to begin training ' we have n't even spoken to him or contemplated him running in a competition , ' @entity65 said			1
' he has got to be able to train first and be in some decent form as a world - class athlete before we would allow him to run in a competition			0
' if he trains well and his mindset is right then by all means we will look at competitions and options			0
when that will be we do n't know			0
it could happen quickly or it could take a year			0
' but at the moment , there is no specific date when it comes to him returning to training			0
' in the current state he is in he might get up tomorrow and give the coach a phone call and say he might want to train again			0
he then might not want to train for a few days			0
' we are not going to force him			0
we are going to be guided by him			0
' @entity1 ' family said : ' @entity1 is not back on any official training programme			1
' this may change in future , but this will be a decision taken by @entity1 , and @entity1 alone			2
at this point @entity1 is still in an extremely traumatized state and has made it clear to all of us that he is not able or willing to even contemplate this issue at this stage			2
' we can confirm that we did have a meeting with @entity1 yesterday where various family members and his trainer were present			2
' we all encouraged him to get back onto the track to help stabilise him emotionally			0
' @entity1 has been out running on a number of isolated occasions in the days following the relaxation of his bail conditions , but each time has been very difficult and he has " struggled immensely " with the decision to even leave the house			1
' as a family however we encourage him to start exercising as we believe it is a vital step in helping him deal with the trauma			2
' mr @entity65 insisted @entity1 ' desire to start training again did not show disrespect to the family of @entity17			1
' i ca n't see there would be any people saying this is disrespectful			0
this is not disrespectful to @entity17 or her family			2
' this has been part of his life for so many years			0
if it makes things easier for him to work through it and get some sense back into his life , let him run and let him jog			0
' he 's a human being and that 's maybe an outlet for him			2
' @entity1 denies murder in the @entity5 killing of model @entity17 , saying he mistook her for a nighttime intruder in his home			1
his next scheduled court appearance is june 4 , when prosecutors say they intend to serve indictments			0
the athlete is free to compete in @entity211 this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms in march to allow him to make money			0
it is certain to prove controversial as it potentially paves the way for @entity1 , one of the world â€™s most successful athletes , to earn vast sums of money while he is awaiting trial			2
although charged with murder , @entity1 has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter @entity211 by the @entity225 .			2
