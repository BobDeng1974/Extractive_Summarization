by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 9 july 2013 scientists have developed a ‘ no - frills ’ form of @entity3 they claim will cost £ 170 and work as well as the conventional technique			1
the budget version , which could soon be available in @entity7 , economises on expensive drugs and incubators , and instead uses a cheap test - tube set and a chemical reaction inspired by @entity13 hangover tablets			1
despite its basic form , tests show it to be at least as good as the normal technique , which is carried out in multi-million - pound labs and costs up to £ 15,000			1
a low - tech simplified form of @entity3 that makes use of baking soda has the potential to slash the cost of assisted conception , bringing it within reach of millions more childless couples around the world in a @entity33 trial , almost a third of the participants became pregnant			1
in total , 12 babies have been born so far , the @entity35 ’s annual conference in @entity36 heard yesterday			0
with the kit ’s inventors believing it could replace conventional @entity3 in most cases , the breakthrough could help millions of women fulfil their dream of motherhood cheaply			1
researcher dr @entity47 , of the @entity48 in @entity33 , said the kit would ‘ undoubtedly open up a new era in the history of @entity3 ’			1
the international research team ’s main aim is to help couples in the developing world , but they accept it heralds no - frills ivf in the @entity7			1
a conventional @entity3 lab contains expensive incubators in rooms with a purified air supply to keep everything sterile			1
costs are increased by drugs to boost egg production , the selection of the best embryos and freezing of the rest , and the screening of embryos for genetic defects			2
but professor @entity72 , the kit ’s inventor , said he had gone back to basics			0
one of the keys to @entity3 treatment is to grow the fledgling embryo in a nutrient mixture that is neither too acidic or too alkaline , achieved by pumping expensive , medical - grade carbon dioxide into the incubator			1
but he showed it was possible to generate the gas needed by dissolving an @entity13 tablet in water			0
he then moved on to mixing baking soda with citric acid to make the gas			0
his kit is made up of two 7p tubes with rubber stoppers that are connected by tubing			1
the carbon dioxide is made in the first and transferred to the second by the tube			0
the woman ’s eggs and man ’s sperm are injected into the second tube , where , if all goes well , at least one of the eggs will be fertilised			0
everything remains airtight , thanks to the rubber stoppers , removing the need for purified air			0
the embryos grow in the nutrient mixture in the tube			2
after three to five days , they are then ready to transfer to the woman ’s womb			0
the technique , which does away with expensive labs , clean rooms , and incubators , could cut the basic cost of @entity3 by up to 90 per cent , experts predict the technique uses fewer drugs at lower doses , which costs less and leads to fewer , higher quality embryos , meaning the costs of selection , freezing and screening are slashed			1
combined with other measures it opens up the prospect of @entity3 for less than £ 200 per treatment cycle professor @entity72 , of the @entity130 in the @entity131 , said : ‘ the basic requirements of a human embryo are very simple			1
‘ the embryos do n’t know if they are living in an expensive incubator and a lab with purified air or in a little tube			2
’ most of the 50,000 women who have @entity3 each year in @entity7 pay for it themselves			1
the create fertility clinic in @entity36 ’s @entity145 plans to introduce the new technique as soon as it gets authorisation from the @entity150 watchdog			2
its medical director dr @entity151 , a member of the walking @entity154 charity , which is planning to launch the kit in the developing world , said : ‘ there are a lot of women out there who ca n’t afford @entity3 and ca n’t get it on the @entity162 either			1
’ dr @entity164 , of the @entity165 , said : ‘ it takes someone thinking outside the box to revolutionise the way we do things			2
‘ if this works as well as they ’re predicting , it ’s exactly the sort of thing the @entity162 would like to look at and embrace			0
it ’s a no - brainer			2
’ the @entity150 said : ‘ we welcome efforts to reduce the cost of @entity3			1
‘ we ’d certainly be open to discussing any proposal to introduce this method to the @entity7			1
’ the new technique is based on a pared down incubating system consisting of two connected glass tubes			1
one tube generates carbon dioxide by combining citric acid and sodium bicarbonate , or baking soda			2
the @entity187 keeps acidity levels stable in the second tube , which contains a culture medium and where fertilisation and embryo development takes place a group of chemicals found in some cosmetics and plastics have a negative impact on the success of @entity3 treatment , according to a new study			1
phthalates are thought to be responsible for a general decline in fertility in both men and women			0
the new study by dr @entity208 of @entity209 and @entity210 now also suggests that they reduce the chance of successful @entity3			2
dr @entity208 studied the progress of 231 women scheduled for @entity3 at the @entity209 between 2004 and 2012			2
urine samples were taken at the start of , and throughout , treatment and analysed for phthalates			0
the results were then compared to the number of eggs produced following ovarian stimulation , embryo development , and implantation failure			0
results first showed that urinary phthalates were detected in almost all the women , reflecting the widespread level of exposure			0
the results also showed the odds of implantation failure increased with rising phthalate levels			0
the results showed that urinary concentrations of some commonly used phthalates were ‘ dose - dependently ’ associated with an increased risk of implantation failure			0
however , the results did not detect any association between levels of urinary phthalates and rates of fertilisation or embryo development			0
dr @entity208 believes the results ‘ support the hypothesis ’ that phthalates are widespread in the environment and may well have an adverse effect on female fertility , particularly when tested in the model of @entity3			2
she said : ‘ we are all primarily exposed to phthalates through inhalation and ingestion			0
‘ it is extremely difficult if not impossible to avoid exposure to phthalates , since they are in so many products			0
’ however , she added that exposure can be reduced by limiting the use of personal care products with fragrances in them , including many of the modern baby care products and air fresheners , limiting the use of plastic food storage containers and plastic wraps , especially not heating food in them , and reading the labels and avoid children 's toys made of plastics that contain phthalates .			0

technique could bring @entity3 within reach of millions more childless couples
could cost less than £ 200 per cycle , compared to £ 5,000 in @entity7 clinics now
it produces just as many *viable* embryos as the conventional method
technique uses two connected tubes - one generates @entity187 to keep acidity stable in the other , which is where fertilisation takes place
