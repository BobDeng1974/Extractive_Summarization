the technique uses @entity10 scanning to show the soft tissues inside the brain , in real time			1
so unlike an x-ray , which is effectively a photograph , this is like a live video feed from inside the head			1
the images are used to create a three - dimensional map of the brain , which is shown on a screen , allowing surgeons to pre-plan the operation instead of going in blind			1
brain tumours are among the hardest to remove completely			1
some surgeons describe the process as like ‘ trying to extract a spider from jelly ’			1
while parts of the head are easily cut away , the nature of such cancers means it spreads through the brain – so ‘ legs ’ may be left , which will continue to grow			1
taking away too much healthy brain tissue can result in long - term damage and complications such as loss of speech , vision and motor functions			1
during the new ‘ satnav ’ operation , images can be updated during surgery , making it far easier to target the tumour precisely and helping to avoid harm to the surrounding brain			1
mr @entity51 , neurosurgeon at the @entity52 in @entity53 , has performed more than 100 of these operations since the technology became available two years ago			2
he says : ‘ we can stop the operation and scan the brain while the head is still open to double - check that all the tumour has gone			1
‘ patients have their wound closed up only once the scan gives the all - clear			2
it lessens the need for a second operation a few days later to remove any tumour left behind			1
afterwards , it leaves more vital functions intact because the surgery is so controllable			2
’ one patient to have benefited is @entity2 , 22 , a trainee nurse			2
@entity2 lives with her parents , @entity74 , 41 , and @entity75 , 42 , who run a roofing business , and her sister @entity77 , 19 , in @entity78 , @entity79			2
@entity2 ’s problems began in 2008 , when she suffered the first of a series of seizures			2
‘ i was talking to my mum when i had a strong sense of déjà vu , ’ she says			2
‘ apparently , then i babbled something about my brother – but i do n’t have a brother			0
then i felt really tired and slept for two hours			0
’ guided in : surgeons remove @entity2 's tumour during a 13 - hour operation in june 2011 a week later @entity2 fainted			1
initially she put the incidents down to exhaustion			0
she was studying performing arts and dancing seven days a week			0
but when she started to feel a numbness in her face , she went to her gp , fearing she had had a stroke			0
he immediately referred her for a brain scan , which revealed a tangerine - sized tumour			1
every day at least 20 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour , and @entity2 ’s type , an epidermoid tumour ( also called an epidermoid cyst ) , makes up about one per cent of those			1
it is benign ( non-cancerous ) and is formed by skin cells deposited in the wrong place during brain development in the womb			1
this causes a cyst to form , which makes up the tumour			0
it is likely @entity2 was born with it , and due to its slow growth she developed symptoms only when it got big enough to put pressure on her brain and trigger seizures			1
her neurologist told her that because of its position , the tumour was inoperable			0
her only option was to try anti-epileptic drugs to see if they would control the seizures , which continued to worsen – and often led to her blacking out completely			2
hard to reach : it is likely @entity2 was born with the tumour ( pictured ) then , two years ago her neurologist referred her to mr @entity51 as she was considered an ideal candidate for the new ‘ satnav ’ procedure			0
@entity2 underwent the 13 - hour operation under general anaesthetic in june 2011			0
after nine days , she was sent home			0
eighteen months later she suffered another major seizure – and has been put back on anti-epileptic medication , which has now controlled the problem			0
she has since returned to work			0
despite not having a perfect result , she is happy			0
she says : ‘ the reality of my ordeal sank in only about a year after the op – i was looking at photos of my brain after surgery and burst into tears			2
it felt like a release			0
i decided to give up dancing for nursing			0
i started my training in september			0
i felt so inspired by the wonderful medical team that saved my life , i want to give something back			0

new technique uses @entity10 scanning to show tissues inside brain in real time
images are used to create @entity168 map of the brain so surgeons can pre-plan
brain tumours are among hardest to remove completely
