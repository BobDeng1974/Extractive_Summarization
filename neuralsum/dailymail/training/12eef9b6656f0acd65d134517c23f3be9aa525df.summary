by @entity0 she 's less than two weeks into her reign but @entity4 's @entity3 @entity2 was every inch the royal style icon as she was welcomed by @entity8 first lady @entity7 in @entity9 today			1
fresh from a successful trip to meet the @entity12 at the @entity13 , @entity2 was immaculate in a silver - grey sheath dress and tailored jacket , accessorised with a chic snakeskin clutch			1
@entity2 and her husband , the new king @entity17 of @entity4 , are on a state visit to @entity8 , the first of a series that also includes trips to @entity22 and @entity23			1
glamorous : @entity4 's @entity3 @entity2 meets @entity8 first lady @entity7 in @entity9 the royal couple travelled to @entity8 at the request of president @entity27 , who sent an invitation along with a message of congratulation following their coronation on the 19th june			1
since then , their duties have included a trip to @entity36 where they met @entity38 at the @entity13 and a number of engagements in @entity4 , among them the 150th anniversary celebrations for the @entity4 @entity43 in @entity44			0
there , the new queen , immaculate as ever , was mobbed by adoring crowds - although even that failed to leave her looking less than lovely			0
now considered one of the world 's most glamorous monarchs , @entity2 is as famous for her dress sense as she is for her charity work			2
the 41 - year - old mother - of - two has carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon and even , on one memorable occasion , managed to outshine the ultra-glamorous @entity58			0
elegant : the @entity4 queen was on her second overseas visit since being crowned on 19th june stylish : @entity2 is now considered one of the world 's most glamorous monarchs thanks to her killer wardrobe her current wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses , sky - scraping court shoes and eye - catching jewels is all a far cry from her early days as a newsreader , when she embraced the bland @entity72 suit and was rarely seen in public wearing anything else			1
but since marrying into the @entity4 royal family in 2004 , her wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation			0
she adores a leg - lengthening nude heel and is almost as addicted to her @entity79 suede tan court shoes as the @entity80 is to her nude patent @entity84 ' @entity83 ' heels			0
the @entity4 queen also shares another trait with the @entity87 's future queen : a penchant for homegrown labels and the high street			0
in @entity2 's case , that means slim - fitting sheath dresses picked up in @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 - many of which she wears time and time again			2
royal welcome : queen @entity2 looks on as @entity99 signs the visitors ' book at @entity8 's @entity102 warm : the newly crowned queen of @entity4 smiles as she chats to president @entity27 of @entity8 that , however , does n't mean she wo n't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye			1
her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer , @entity109 , which she wore on her last visit to @entity8 in 2012 , again for her 40th birthday party and again in march this year			2
another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by @entity117 which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer			0
off duty , the princess ' style becomes markedly more relaxed , with cropped trousers , billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe			0
but as her occasional foray back into grey @entity117 tailored trousers reveals , some style habits die hard - @entity3 or not			2
looking good : @entity2 was the picture of elegance as she and @entity99 met with the @entity8 leader busy schedule : along with their visit to @entity8 , the @entity4 royals will travel to @entity23 and @entity22			1
