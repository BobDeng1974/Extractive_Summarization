@entity1 's ambition to crack @entity2 has suffered a huge setback , with the cancellation of her cookery show @entity6			1

' staff have been told to take alternative employment and not to wait for the taste to go back into production – it 's over			2

a source told @entity25 : ' it 's an open secret that the taste is not coming back for a fourth season			0
@entity17 are actively looking for an alternative cookery show			1
but the fact it lasted three seasons is no disgrace at all			0
