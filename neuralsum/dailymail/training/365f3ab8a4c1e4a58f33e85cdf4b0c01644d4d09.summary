by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:52 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 21 april 2013 only last year @entity3 ’s gardens , parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour			1
but @entity8 has been far less obliging this spring			2
much of the country has failed to shake off the winter blues , as a bitter march followed hard on the heels of a cold winter			2
with spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers such as tulips or bluebells , many will be wondering if @entity3 will ever burst into bloom			1
a burst of colour : visitors at @entity23 's @entity22 saw the cherry trees in full bloom gloomy : this year the cherry walk is bare and barren as the harsh weather has forced the trees into ' survival mode ' but garden writer @entity30 , a former @entity31 vice-chairman , says that with the arrival of warmer weather , we are likely to have a much shorter but more intense spring awakening			1
forecasters are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners			1
mr @entity42 said : ‘ plants , particularly spring varieties , have a self - survival kit			0
' they wo n’t grow until the temperature is above @entity48 ( @entity49 ) degrees for a period of time			0
once warm weather sticks around they ’ll kick into rapid growth			1
‘ because of the bitterly cold march , we are running about a month late compared to a normal season			2
then : @entity57 picks tulips in the fields at @entity60 , @entity61 last year now : there is an unseasonable lack of blooming tulips when @entity57 visits the fields this year 2012 : @entity66 5 , enjoys the bluebells in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 a year ago 2013 : this year , the woods of @entity68 are empty of blue blossoms ‘ instead of it being a drawn - out spring , we are going to have an explosion of colour , but over a shorter @entity77 will soon be treated to a fantastically colourful bounty			1
’ after a pleasant , sunny weekend for much of the country , the @entity79 says temperatures will remain slightly warmer than the seasonal average this week – reaching @entity84 ( @entity83 ) by thursday in the south east			1
but it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens			0
at the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly @entity89 ( @entity90 )			0
slowly but surely : @entity91 , 28 , soaks up the spring sunshine as she sits among the daffodils in @entity95 's @entity94 today pretty : people punting on the @entity97 in @entity98 today , with clear blue skies and warmer temperatures blue skies : it was a chilly start to the day across much of the @entity3 , but the bright , crisp conditions were ideal for runners taking part in the @entity105 unsettled : dog walkers in @entity107 enjoyed the spring sunshine at the beach - but wore coats to keep off the chill having fun : dogs were pictured enjoying the spring sunshine on @entity115 in @entity107 today may is almost upon us , but there were still patches of frost in parts of the @entity3 overnight between saturday and sunday , with a low of -2.7c in @entity123 , @entity124			2
while there will be some sunny spells across the @entity3 in the coming week , @entity125 are advised to keep their umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses			1
mr @entity131 described bands of rain moving in from the @entity134 , bringing wind and showers to the @entity3			0
' this week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable			2
' we 've got bands of rain moving in from the @entity134 , although it wo n't be a wash out			0
' @entity143 start : runners basked in bright sunshine as the @entity105 kicked off in the capital this morning , but temperatures remained chilly early on @entity148 : the sun shone brightly over @entity95 as the men 's wheelchair elite approached the finish line during today 's marathon making the most of it : kite - flyers did n't let the moderate temperatures put them off making the most of the sunshine over @entity161 in @entity162 calm seas : lifeguards took part in a practice session in a sunny @entity115 , @entity107 , today preparing for spring : fallow deer at @entity168 in @entity169 were shedding their winter coats - and birds were spotted plucking the moulting fur to line their nests cheeky : jackdaws were spotted plucking at fallow deer shedding their winter coats at a safari park in @entity169 ' mixed bag ' : @entity79 forecasters are predicting a week of changeable weather ' a fair bit of cloud ' is also expected throughout the week , he said , with conditions likely to change from sunny to grey even ' within each day '			1
' temperatures in the south might manage @entity84 in the @entity187 later in the week , perhaps by thursday , ' said the forecaster , who added that current temperatures were fairly typical for the time of year			1
' so it will be warm at times in the south			0
broadly speaking we 've got a north - south split , with the north wetter and windier , but still with some sunshine			0
in the south it will be less wet and windy			0
' while temperatures dropped to @entity203 in @entity124 overnight , @entity200 in @entity201 recorded a low of @entity205 , in a ' flip ' of the typical pattern of warmer conditions in the south .			0

@entity211 and gardens are struggling to live up to last year 's blooming ' *success*
seasonal flowers such as tulips or bluebells are already late
@entity79 is predicting ' mixed bag ' of weather in the coming week
