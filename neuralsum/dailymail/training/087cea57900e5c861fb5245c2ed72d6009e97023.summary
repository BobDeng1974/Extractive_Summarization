ridden by @entity26 , the 1 - 10 favourite passed the finish line seven lengths clear , receiving three cheers			0
wearing a sombre black hat , the great trainer 's voice has been reduced to a whisper due to illness picked up as a side - effect of his cancer treatment , and he spoke only briefly			2

but the prize horse won with such ease over an extended mile and a quarter that he is just 1 - 4 to end on a winning note in @entity67 at the @entity68			0
@entity5 's long - standing owner , prince @entity69 , was also retaining the race he has sponsored for over 20 years , and was aked as to whether he would be tempted by the @entity68			1
winners : sir @entity1 would not let cancer stop him from watching @entity5 race to victory at @entity75 yesterday in good health : sir @entity1 at @entity60 in 1999 ' i do n't think so , ' he said			1
' i will talk to @entity1 about it but we 'll see			2
i will do whatever @entity1 thinks ' i did n't think a mile and a quarter was a problem , but more than that i do n't think so			2
' the owner 's racing manager , @entity83 , said : ' for @entity1 and the team to bring @entity5 in such great shape to @entity15 , in front of a brilliant crowd who appreciated him , is absolutely fantastic			1
' then for the horse to perform like he did , it 's a dream , is n't it ? ' considering the @entity68 , mr @entity83 said : ' he 's not in there			0
