@entity0 is confident @entity1 is playing better now than when his goals helped spark @entity4 's remarkable recovery last season			1
the 21 - year - old striker scored five times in three @entity9 appearances at the end of the last campaign to help drag the @entity4 back from the brink of relegation			1
@entity0 , who recalled the former @entity15 frontman from a loan spell at @entity17 to hand him his big chance , has installed @entity1 as his first - choice lone striker this time around and although he is yet to open his league account , the manager is convinced he is offering even more to the team			1
@entity4 striker @entity1 has not scored in the @entity9 this season @entity4 manager @entity0 has come out in support of his striker ahead of the clash with @entity26 the @entity27 said : ' i actually think he is playing better than he did last year , but he is scoring fewer goals			1
' it 's about finding a balance			0
we do n't want him to be the best player on the pitch every week without scoring , but nor do we want him to be awful and scoring a goal every now and then			0
' he needs to find the balance between playing well and scoring - and he will get there			0
' we need to keep on creating chances for him and it is only when we stop creating chances that he will have a problem			0
' there 's a big difference between a striker who does n't score because his team is not creating chances , and one who has chances but is missing them			2
' @entity1 scored five times in three games at the end of the last campaign to save @entity4 from relegation @entity1 is not alone in enduring a barren spell in front of goal with none of @entity0 's three main frontmen - @entity61 international @entity58 and @entity59 counterpart @entity57 are the others - having yet registered this season			1
but as he heads into saturday 's home clash with @entity26 , which will provide @entity4 with their latest attempt to secure a first @entity9 win of the season , @entity0 is happy that the youngster has improved significantly as a player during their time together			1
no @entity4 strikers have scored a @entity9 goal this season , including @entity57 ( right ) the 46 - year - old said : ' he is holding the ball the ball up better now , and i think that 's due to the way we train and the fact that he knows just what we want him to do			2
' it 's not just about doing it in games , it 's also about taking care of the ball every day in training , and he does that			2
' he has been impressive and he has been a massive player for us			0
i enjoy watching him and i just want to start seeing him put the ball in the net			0
