@entity0 may find themselves sixth in the @entity1 - with just three wins to their credit from eight matches - but @entity5 was still unbowed			1
the 10 - point gap to leaders @entity8 , whom they face on sunday , poses no problem in the @entity12 's mind			1
@entity0 , he proclaimed after the 2 - 2 draw at @entity15 , can still win the title			1
' call me arrogant but we can still catch @entity8			2
i have done it before , ' he said after @entity21 rescued @entity0 a point at @entity23			1
leaving the arrogance aside , @entity24 is right - he has done it before			0
he has even endured worse starts and gone on to win the league			0
@entity5 is still confident @entity0 can win the @entity1 title , despite a 10 - point gap to @entity8 following their 2 - 2 draw at @entity32 on monday night @entity21 fired home @entity0 's equaliser at @entity32 with just three minutes remaining the result leaves @entity0 sixth in the table ahead of sunday 's showdown with @entity8 the @entity12 is a notoriously slow starter in new jobs and new seasons			1
what we saw at @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , we are currently seeing at @entity0			1
let 's consider @entity0 's position at present			2
the optimism of an unbeaten pre-season soon faded when @entity51 won at @entity52 on the opening day			2
they laboured to disappointing draws at @entity55 and then @entity56 , either side of a humiliating 4 - 0 defeat to @entity58 in the @entity59			0
@entity24 finally enjoyed his first competitive win when @entity61 were thrashed 4 - 0 but they were then stunned by @entity62			0
back - to - back home wins over @entity64 and @entity65 saw @entity0 climb into the @entity66 places prior to monday night 's late rescue mission in the @entity68			1
recovery : @entity24 started slowly when he took over at @entity46 in 2009 but went on to win the league leg - end : @entity24 shows off his knees as @entity46 celebrate their 2010 @entity74 triumph lift it high : @entity46 were eighth at the end of november but then went unbeaten until march to secure the title october 26 - @entity8 ( @entity78 ) november 2 - @entity79 ( a ) november 8 - @entity80 ( @entity78 ) november 22 - @entity81 ( a ) november 29 - @entity82 ( @entity78 ) december 2 - @entity83 ( @entity78 ) much has been said and written about the clear disparities between @entity0 's attack and defence - the latter left horrendously exposed as @entity88 played in @entity89 for the @entity32 ' second goal			1
but @entity0 fans can take some comfort from events during @entity24 's first season at @entity46 in 2009 , when a nightmare start very nearly ended in a treble triumph			1
they started with back - to - back draws against @entity98 and @entity99 before slumping to defeat at @entity100			0
eight games in , the same stage @entity0 are at now , they sat seventh in the @entity74 but had an identical record of wins , draws and losses			1
by the end of november they had won just five of 13 matches and had slumped to eighth			0
@entity110 to this was a dreadful start to their @entity66 campaign , with home and away defeats by @entity114 leaving them staring at an early exit and @entity24 fighting for his job			0
he responded in typically ebullient fashion ahead of a trip to @entity121 in late october			0
repeatedly describing himself as a ' @entity123 ' ( ' process manager ' ) , @entity24 laid down the law : ' i am at @entity46 , either you give me time or you do n't			1
' as speculation mounted that @entity24 would be ousted before the winter break , he raised the stakes : ' if i was gone now , whom would @entity46 sign ? [ sir @entity131 ? [ @entity133 ] @entity132 ? ' they might be more successful , but they are unavailable			2
' repeat : @entity24 's @entity45 also started slowly in 2008 - 2009 but they went on to claim the title dwarfed : it took @entity24 some time to convince the fans at @entity44 that he was the right man for the job protest : fans at the @entity139 called for @entity24 to be dismissed as results did n't go their way first eight league games @entity98 ( a ) 1 - 1 @entity99 ( @entity78 ) 1 - 1 @entity100 ( a ) 1 - 2 @entity143 ( @entity78 ) 3 - 0 @entity144 ( a ) 5 - 1 @entity145 ( @entity78 ) 2 - 1 @entity146 ( a ) 0 - 1 @entity147 ( @entity78 ) 0 - 0 position : 7th @entity149 : 12 @entity46 went on to win the @entity74 by five points			1
they also won the @entity151 and were runners - up in the @entity66			0
first eight league games @entity51 ( @entity78 ) 1 - 2 @entity55 ( a ) 1 - 1 @entity56 ( a ) 0 - 0 @entity61 ( @entity78 ) 4 - 0 @entity62 ( a ) 3 - 5 @entity64 ( @entity78 ) 2 - 1 @entity65 ( @entity78 ) 2 - 1 @entity15 ( a ) 2 - 2 position : 6th @entity155 : 12 @entity0 are out of the @entity59 and currently trail @entity8 by 10 points in the league			1
the @entity159 campaign starts in january			0
@entity46 won 2 - 1 at @entity121 and remained unbeaten until late march , hitting the summit of the table just after the winter break			1
in the @entity66 , @entity46 had to win their final group game away at @entity164 in order to reach the knockout stage and they were a goal down after half - an - hour			1
then , @entity168 was brought down for a penalty - the first @entity46 had been awarded all season			1
as the outfield players glanced at each other , it was the goalkeeper @entity174 who had the bottle to step up and put the ball past @entity178			0
in the second - half , everything finally came together			0
@entity46 outplayed @entity164 to win 4 - 1 and never looked back			1
they won the title by five points and recovered from their shaky start to reach the final of the @entity66 , where his old understudy , @entity185 , triumphed with @entity187			0
@entity24 was vindicated , his ' process ' , once seen through to its end , was a successful one			0
upset : @entity24 did not make himself popular by trying to move @entity44 hero @entity191 making his case : @entity24 presents the @entity44 squad during his second spell in charge when he guided unfashionable @entity45 to the @entity198 title in 2009 , the season started with back - to - back defeats by @entity200 and @entity201			2
they promptly went 28 matches unbeaten and won the league by 11 points			0
at @entity44 , he dismayed pretty much everyone at the club by trying to enforce his philosophy , which was completely different to the club 's			2
@entity24 asked star man @entity191 to play on the left wing rather than through the middle , leading to rows in the camp and the fans getting on his back			0
at the end of his first season , many remained unhappy , as @entity219 recorded in his book , @entity44 : a people 's passion : ' the jury is out on @entity24 , a @entity12 lacking the humanity of @entity225 and the popularity of @entity227 , both of whose heads have rolled in the space of less than two years			1
' @entity44 may be at the top of the league , but the fans are unconvinced			2
they have watched the team pathetically founder in @entity236 , while continuing to play lacklustre football in the @entity1 , winning seemingly by default rather than design			2
' vindicated : @entity24 struggled initially at @entity43 but he eventually delivered the @entity66 but you could n't argue with the results - well , eventually			1
the following year , @entity44 found themselves 10th in @entity242 in early december and at one stage they lost four on the bounce			2
when things finally clicked , @entity44 won 19 of their next 24 games , winning the title by a commanding 11 - point margin			1
it all came right in the end			0
and this pattern dates right back to the beginning of his managerial career , when he was named manager of @entity43 against all the odds back in 1991			1
though a managerial novice , @entity24 was a disciplinarian and his methods certainly ruffled a few feathers			0
he fell out with leading players @entity260 , @entity262 and @entity263 va n't schip by tinkering with their positions on the field			0
and when @entity43 took just 20 points from their first 16 games , @entity24 had to endure the fans calling for club legend @entity227 to replace him			2
' i will not change my attitude , ' @entity24 said			0
he did n't , and his time in @entity273 yielded three @entity12 league titles , the @entity275 and the @entity66 in 1995			0
so history tells us that things will come right for @entity24 in the end			0
now comes an acid test - @entity0 play @entity8 and @entity79 in the next fortnight , the first real test of their vulnerable backline @entity44 ( first spell ) 1997 - 98 : 2nd after 14 matches ( finished 1st ) 1998 - 99 : 10th after 14 matches ( finished 1st ) @entity44 ( @entity287 spell ) 2002 - 03 : 13th after 14 matches ( sacked in january with the club 12th			1
) @entity45 2005 - 06 : 3rd after 13 matches ( finished 2nd ) 2006 - 07 : 3rd after 13 matches ( finished 3rd ) 2007 - 08 : 10th after 13 matches ( finished 11th ) 2008 - 09 : 4th after 11 matches ( finished 1st ) - opening defeats to @entity200 and @entity201 @entity46 2009 - 2010 : 7th after 13 matches ( finished 1st ) 2010 - 2011 : 8th after 13 matches ( sacked in april with the club 4th			2

@entity0 sit sixth in the @entity1 table after eight games
they needed a late @entity21 goal to earn point at @entity15
but @entity5 says they can *bridge* 10 - point gap to leaders @entity8
the @entity307 visit @entity52 on sunday
@entity12 has a track record of starting slowly in new jobs
happened at @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 during his career
but the manager always delivered success in the end
