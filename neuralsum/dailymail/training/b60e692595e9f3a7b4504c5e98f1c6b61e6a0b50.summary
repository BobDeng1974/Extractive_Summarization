by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 caretaker boss @entity2 has said the texts between @entity5 and @entity6 are ‘ hard to justify ’			1
@entity6 resigned from @entity3 as sporting director in the wake of the allegations on thursday			1
@entity5 was close to be being named @entity3 boss before @entity12 ’s extraordinary revelations regarding discriminatory texts between the pair			1
towering : @entity15 put @entity3 ahead against @entity16 but they eventually lost 2 - 1 in charge : @entity3 caretaker manager @entity2 is confident with the squad gone : palace sporting director @entity6 ( right ) has resigned following allegations he exchanged ' sexist , racist and homophobic ' text messages with former @entity21 boss @entity5 ( left ) at the helm : @entity3 caretaker manager @entity2 is likely to take charge again against @entity24 unfortunate : @entity2 's @entity3 side were unlucky not to get a point from their game against @entity16 spectator : @entity2 said he did n't want to get involved in the reported texts or their content speaking ahead of his side ’s @entity34 derby against @entity24 , @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t want to get involved in the texts			1
that sort of language is not something you hear in football time			2
it ’s hard to justify if it ’s true			2
' i had a chat with them ( the players ) about being focused			2
they have been through a lot of things together			0
' he ( @entity6 ) was brought in to scout so the chairman will have to look at that situation and i 've spoken to the chairman and that will remain private			1
' and @entity2 was coy about the managerial situation at the club , although he insists he would be willing to have a crack at it			1
woes : @entity24 have struggled to find the net but @entity2 expects them to pose a real threat from set pieces talking tactics : @entity24 boss @entity65 will ensure his side are well drilled as they visit @entity67 bit of a stretch : palace captain @entity70 positions his body to try and stop @entity72 from advancing palace host @entity24 at @entity67 on saturday and @entity6 is targeting three points following their opening day defeat at @entity16			1
' obviously if i can get three points my case ( to be manager ) is stronger , ' he said			0
' it 's up to the chairman to decide who he wants			1
he knows what i can do it 's just whether he feels it 's the right time ' keeping the players focused is okay , they are serious and focused			1
the lads know their jobs			0
' @entity88 has a good record and got @entity21 promoted			0
he is used to players who want to work hard and are organised			0
and that style suits our squad here , we work hard and we want to be organised			0
' @entity95 is still here helping me - there 's no excuses for us not to perform			1
' the tricky part is the transfers			0
we have meetings all the time , we need to look at what we need			0
if we can come up with some names for the new manager for when he comes out			0
' foot in : @entity105 attempts to cut out a cross from @entity16 's right - back @entity107 @entity109 and large : @entity110 turns away with the ball as @entity3 's @entity112 tries to catch up with him watching on : hangeland can only look as @entity16 defender @entity113 ( right ) equalises at the @entity114 the @entity115 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity5 ’s time at @entity21			1
in the course of a search by the @entity125 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity5 ’s employment at @entity21 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity88 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity88 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
that said , @entity88 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			2
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity149 process is complete			0
the @entity115 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity88 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			2
if @entity88 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity88 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity149 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity3			1
@entity88 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			2
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity88 ’s involvement in this matter			1
@entity88 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity88 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity88 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity149 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter .			0
