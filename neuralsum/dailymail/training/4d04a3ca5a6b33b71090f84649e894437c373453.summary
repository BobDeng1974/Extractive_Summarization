@entity0 has been hungry for goals at @entity2 since joining in a £ 16million deal from @entity4 in the summer but the @entity6 striker has portrayed his predatory instincts in an altogether different manner			1
the 24 - year - old uploaded an @entity11 picture of himself on wednesday dressed in what appears to resemble a shark			2
along with the caption , ' @ pumarunnining # puma we are forever faster and different ? ? ' the enigmatic forward has his face covered by a shark hoodie and with two hangers representing his hands			2
@entity0 posted an @entity11 picture of himself in a shark hoodie on wednesday while his style can be questioned , the @entity25 forward has already proven popular on @entity27 with @entity2 fans already singing a chant in his honour despite his lack of goals			1
@entity0 has only scored once in eight matches for the @entity6 this season - netting their opener in a 2 - 1 victory against @entity38 side @entity36 in the @entity39 last month			1
this poor statistic is one @entity0 is all too aware of that needs improving - especially in the @entity42 where he has failed to break his duck in five games for the club			1
@entity0 admits he needs to improve his goalscoring record of one goal in eight @entity2 appearances so far @entity0 ( second left ) scored @entity2 's opener in their 2 - 1 @entity39 win against @entity36 @entity0 was speaking in an exclusive interview with @entity52 ' i can see already that the @entity2 fans really like me , although i know that maybe they are a little upset because i do n't score			1
i see they appreciate that i am working hard , though , which is nice for me , ' he said in an exclusive interview with @entity52			2
' i know i have one goal in the @entity39 , but in the @entity42 i have to start with one			2
after that , i might set myself a target , but i swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective			1
' i need to get in the box more			2
i do n't do it enough , but it is something i am working to try to do more			0
i have never been a real , out - and - out striker – i have always been someone who goes around the pitch , you know ? the forward has been used largely as a lone striker by @entity6 boss @entity72 in the absence of @entity74 - who is expected to return from a thigh injury to face @entity76 on sunday			1
@entity74 's inclusion in the @entity2 squad is a boost to @entity0 , who revealed his preference is to play alongside another striker in the first - team			1
' if it was my choice , i would always go with two strikers , ' he added			0
' it 's the way i like to play , but @entity72 asked me to play as the first striker			1
i understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right , i need to be in the box otherwise there might be no - one there at all			0
' @entity74 ( right ) is expected to feature against @entity76 after returning from a thigh injury @entity0 's stuttering start has matched that of his new club , who have won three of their first seven league games			1
however , the striker is confident things will improve and believes a strong @entity101 core can only help on the domestic front			0
' i did n't really know much about the club before coming here , but i 've been really surprised , ' said the @entity105 , who spent two - and - a - half years at @entity107 before returning to his homeland			0
' i knew they were a very good team but i did n't know they were as good as they are			0
@entity112 ( right ) is one of many @entity101 talents to have impressed @entity0 at @entity2 ' of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good but i think the players here are amazing			1
' it 's good to see young @entity101 players here too : ( @entity112 ) @entity112 , ( @entity121 ) @entity120 , ( @entity122 ) @entity123			0
i think the more players you have like this , the better			0
' maybe over time you have got used to not seeing so many good , young @entity101 players like that but now we are seeing some - it 's good that they are in my team			0
' @entity2 captain @entity134 ( left ) has been compared to @entity136 midfielder @entity135 by @entity0 the best @entity101 player in the striker 's eyes remains @entity134 , whom he compared to his veteran @entity25 team - mate @entity135			1
' @entity134 is an amazing player			0
i had really not seen much of him before this season , apart from for @entity142 , but wow ! ' @entity0 said			2
' i think of him as being at the same level as @entity135			0
vision , technique , but he is powerful as well			0
' it 's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future			0

@entity2 boss @entity72 says @entity0 needs to score more goals
