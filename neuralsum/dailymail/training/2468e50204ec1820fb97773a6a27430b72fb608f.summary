last week , police remove drums filled with drugs from the property in @entity21 , allegedly run as an alpaca farm by @entity88 as a front for a marijuana operation this is the second time the 66 - year - old 's property was raided by police			1
this comes after police seized seized drums full of shrink - wrapped bags of cannabis and $ 300,000 in cash from another property near @entity21 last week			1
drugs and cash have been seized from a property owned by gangster @entity88 , who had not been seen for days it was reportedly run as an alpaca farm by known criminal @entity88			0
@entity88 , who was named as a ‘ person of interest ’ in the 1974 murders of @entity9 and her two daughters has not been seen for days , @entity105 reported			1
police are investigating whether there is a link between @entity112 and the 66 - year - old man who is expected to appear at @entity79 on thursday			1
the whereabouts of @entity112 ’s associate @entity118 , another person of interest in the murder investigation , are also unknown			2
both men , for whom police have not issued arrest warrants , were charged with the murders in 1980 following a coronial inquest but the case collapsed due to a lack of evidence			1
the day before wednesday 's drug raid , homicide detectives found evidence in at two properties linked to @entity112 - including his @entity131 breeding operation			1
a jar containing financial records was also discovered			0
in 1974 , during the summer school holidays , @entity9 , 43 , was at home in @entity136 , @entity137 , with her daughters @entity139 , 13 , and 11 - year - old @entity140			1

despite several police investigations , a coronial inquest and the charges being laid against @entity88 and @entity118 the three murders have remained unsolved and have become one of the most notorious killings in @entity167 history			0
forty years on , police are confident they are closer to an arrest , as well as focussed on the potential motives for the murders			2
the first motive relates to sexual assault of the two young @entity9 girls , and that @entity9 was willing to exchange information about a criminal gang			2
the second motive is that ms @entity9 was murdered because she knew too much about one of @entity180 's most notorious crimes - the firebombing mass murder at the whiskey au @entity184 nightclub on @entity137 's sleazy city strip , known as ' @entity186 '			2

two men , @entity277 , 29 , and @entity278 , 33 , were convicted of arson and murder as part of an extortion campaign			0
but rumours continued to swirl over who else was involved in the mass murder plot			0
the case foundered for lack of evidence , but in january this year , at the request of ms @entity292 ' family on the 40th anniversary of the murders , police commenced a full review of the case with a new focus on the motive for the suspected murders			2
investigators joined with the @entity301 to pursue significant new evidence in four states			0
