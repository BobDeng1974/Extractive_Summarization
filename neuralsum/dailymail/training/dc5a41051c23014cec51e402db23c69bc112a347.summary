@entity1 after having facial implants removed following complications it cost her her fortune and the men she loved			1
and by the time former glamour model @entity1 had ploughed more than £ 1.5million into becoming @entity8 's poster girl for plastic surgery , it very nearly destroyed her relationship with her teenage daughter @entity12			1
after @entity1 's craving to look like a human @entity15 doll led her to have more than 350 procedures - even having her toes shortened so that her feet would look good in sandals - @entity12 had had enough			1
fearful that her mother would die on the operating table , she issued an ultimatum : ' stop having surgery or i 'll leave home			1
' it was the wake - up call @entity1 needed			1

' frankly i did n't care			0
i was fully prepared to put my life on the line to get my natural face back			2
they had to break my jaw and tighten the muscle			0
my ears had to be cut off and i had to have screws put into the right side of my jaw to compensate for muscle damage			2
' my nose had to be cut off to lift my lip in the hope i would get my smile back			1
they warned me there was no guarantee how my face would heal			0

@entity1 with her children @entity80 and @entity66 ' as i got older and realised it was dangerous and saw the pain she went through , i tried to talk her out of the operations			2
four years ago , i had to call an ambulance because she was in so much pain after one procedure			0
it 's put me off cosmetic surgery for life			2
my mother was constantly wrapped in bandages like an @entity93 mummy			0
' it was after having implants intended to make her look like @entity97 went horribly wrong two years ago that @entity1 began to realise her passion for the surgeon 's knife was transforming her into a stretched and deformed @entity15			1
' i had turned myself into a @entity101			1
i looked like a bad drag queen , ' she admits			1
' when papaya was born 18 months ago , i was overjoyed			2
yet i would n't have any photographs taken holding her because i looked so terrible			2
i could n't even smile at my new baby			2

' my obsession has ruined my life			0
i spent every penny on cosmetic surgery			2
i live in a rented apartment			0
i have nothing to show for all the years when i was earning big money			0
i 'm not in a relationship because no man wants to be with an obsessive who wants to have surgery every week			2
