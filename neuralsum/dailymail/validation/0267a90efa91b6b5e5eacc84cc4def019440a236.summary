' you can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time , ' she said			2
' they set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it 's time to be born			0
' the most magical moment in @entity0 's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren she also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband @entity105 , 67 , a retired firefighter , what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child @entity108			1

the saddest moments in @entity0 's career has been when couples have lost babies after years of trying ' i put my hands on her baby when he came out and broke the news to my daughters both times that they 'd had boys			1
' you worry so much more when your daughter is pregnant and in labour			0
that 's mainly because you know what mums have to endure			0
' people say it 's just childbirth but they do n't call it labour for nothing			0
. it 's exhausting and takes women to the limit of endurance			0
' but being a midwife has brought heartache too			2
