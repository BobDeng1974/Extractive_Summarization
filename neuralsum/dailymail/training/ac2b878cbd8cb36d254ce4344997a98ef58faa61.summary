@entity6 admitted she made the remark to @entity8 , originally from @entity9 in @entity10 , in @entity11 but insisted she meant it in kindness			1
the patient later died of septicemia			2

midwife @entity6 , pictured outside @entity25 court , apologised for telling @entity8 she could not have a termination because it was a ' catholic thing ' @entity8 died of a heart attack caused by septicaemia after being refused an abortion and delivering a dead baby ' i did mention it ’s a @entity19 country , ' ms @entity6 told @entity11 coroner dr @entity33			1
' i did n’t mention it in a hurtful context			2
it was in a conversation we had			0
' ms @entity6 said she regrets making the statement , which the coroner said ' went around the world '			2
' i ’m sorry that i said it , ' she added			0
mrs @entity43 , 31 , was admitted to hospital on sunday , october 21 and delivered a dead baby daughter three days later			2
she died the following sunday of a heart attack caused by septicaemia due to @entity48			1
the inquest , in its third day at @entity11 courthouse , has heard claims that a consultant obstetrician , dr @entity52 , made the remark to mrs @entity43 and her husband @entity54 , and also that the midwife said it			1
dr @entity52 , who was cross-examined over her treatment of mrs @entity43 for several hours today , denies using the phrase			1
but the consultant has admitted there were system failures in her care and she also warned of a lack of legal clarity for doctors treating pregnant women who suffer health risks			1
mrs @entity43 was 17 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital in pain			0
asked by mr @entity70 if it would have been insensitive , uncivilised and wrong to use the word catholic to the patient , dr @entity52 said : ' it ’s certainly not something i would say			1
' dr @entity52 revealed there is confusion over how her patient was cared for , including that she had been unaware of blood test abnormalities and that the patient ’s vitals should have been checked more regularly after her foetal membrane ruptured			1
the senior medic was asked by coroner dr @entity33 if the two aspects of mrs @entity43 ’s care could be seen as system failures and she replied ' yes '			1
dr @entity52 revealed that she initially refused a request from the @entity90 to terminate the pregnancy two days after her admission to hospital as at that time there was no risk to her life			1
@entity97 , pictured arriving at the inquest , collapsed and vomited after his wife 's death ' she was well , ' said dr @entity52 under cross-examination			1
' there was no risk to her life			0
if you need to give somebody medication to deliver and there ’s a foetal heartbeat , my understanding is that legally you are considered to be terminating			0
' dr @entity52 spoke in a loud , clear voice as widower @entity97 , who claims she made the @entity19 remark , sat with his friend , a @entity11 - based consultant dr @entity112			1
she addressed the @entity114 guidelines on abortion which refer to terminating a pregnancy if there is a risk to the mother ’s life			0
she said her understanding was that they relate to conditions such as cancer , such as women getting radiotherapy , cervical care or a hysterectomy			0
' my understanding is that this is a case where a woman is diagnosed with a life - threatening illness , usually unrelated to the pregnancy , ' she said			0
dr @entity33 asked if there was confusion over the interpretation of the guidelines			0
' there ’s no law to tell you what you what is permitted or not permitted , ' she replied			0
dr @entity52 admitted there were system failures in her care at @entity144 ( pictured ) @entity8 and @entity97 at an event for the @entity147 community in @entity11 dr @entity52 insisted that when she told mrs @entity43 she could not abort the baby on the tuesday , she used the words : ' in this country it is not legal to terminate a pregnancy on grounds of poor prognosis of the foetus			1
' the doctor agreed that in other jurisdictions mrs @entity43 would have been offered the option of a termination if the prognosis of her foetus was poor			0
' the law in @entity2 does not permit termination even if there ’s no prospect of viability , ' she said			0
dr @entity52 saw mrs @entity43 at 8.30am on the wednesday during her morning round , about two hours after a junior colleague raised concerns over her vitals and condition and suspected sepsis chorioamnionitis , an infection of the foetal membrane			1
she said the patient ’s temperature and pulse rate had fallen in that time and that she had not been told of an earlier entry on the medical notes highlighting a sign of chorioamnionitis			0
dr @entity52 said that had she known this she would then have started the steps for a termination , instead of ordering tests to check for a urine infection			2
' a medical termination usually takes several hours , but i would have started it , ' she said .			0

@entity6 admitted using the words to @entity8
the *nurse* said she meant it as a kindness and not in a ' hurtful context '
@entity198 later died of a heart attack after suffering from septicemia and an inquest is being held into her death at @entity11
consultant dr @entity52 told hearing she did not use the remark
dr @entity52 admitted there were system failures in the care of the dentist
