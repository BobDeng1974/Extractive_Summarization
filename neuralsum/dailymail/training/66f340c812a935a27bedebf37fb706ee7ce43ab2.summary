research : young people whose parents were strict , unaffectionate and demanding are more likely than their peers to become internet addicts ' whereas bad parenting , including parental control and intrusion , that is authoritarian and neglectful parents , has been associated with higher risk for addiction			1
' research on internet addiction is still relatively new , and there are no actual criteria for diagnosing the disorder , though there are many inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities in the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
some of the studies done to date suggest that kids who have trouble relating to others in person might be at higher risk for a problematically high level of internet use			2
those who are socially withdrawn or lonely might also be more likely to spend excessive time online			0
@entity18 's team predicted that the way kids bonded with their parents would predict aspects of their personality as young adults , which in turn would predict their likelihood of internet addiction			1
for the study , more than 700 young adults at technical schools , all around age 20 , filled out questionnaires during class time			0
they answered questions about their feelings of loneliness , sadness and anxiety , and about their internet use			0

other international studies suggest that internet addiction may harm a person 's mental and physical health , she said			1
those who go online excessively tend to be distressed , tense , nervous and irritable , and to have trouble sleeping and fatigue			2
bad parenting : the study found that tough parenting can breed sad children who struggle to make friends , and those personality traits raises their risk of internet addiction ' this discussion is of large interest for the technological society at large , given that internet addiction is related to a medium present in virtually all homes and not regulated , like drugs of abuse , ' @entity139 , who studies the emerging addiction at @entity141 in @entity85 , said			1
' parents would do well to examine the kind of model they present , ' said @entity139 , an adjunct professor of medicine			0

overly permissive parents might use the internet early on as a way to give up responsibility for the kids - an unattended child in front of a computer requires less effort from the parents than an active , present child			0
on the other hand , overly controlling parents can end up with kids who rebel or turn inwards , which might also lead to excessive internet use , he said			0
' parents that identify their children to have some symptoms of addiction , like excessive time spent online or need to spend increasingly longer periods online , inadequate sleep and fatigue , apathy , nervousness , or irritability when offline , impairments in relationships and schoolwork or employment , should contact a health care professional as soon as possible , ' @entity18 said .			0
