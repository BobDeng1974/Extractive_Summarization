by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 10:29 est , 18 march 2014 a @entity3 - style sign on a hillside overlooking @entity5 which read ' @entity6 ' has been removed - after jokers re-arranged it to read ' it 's @entity9 '			1
the original sign - seen as a good advert for the area - mysteriously appeared overnight on the side of the picturesque @entity13 in january			1
but on sunday night , jokers accessed the site and removed some letters before adding an apostrophe to produce the sign ' it 's @entity9 '			1
the original @entity3 - style sign became popular with locals after it appeared on the slopes in january but the new feature has been removed after jokers rearranged the letters to spell out @entity26 @entity27 , which owns the site , then stepped in and removed all the letters on monday because the new wording was considered ' inappropriate '			1
head warden @entity31 said : ' we can see the funny side of @entity34 , but we always said the sign had a finite life and the change to it 's @entity39 was the point to remove it			1
' it is still not known who created the original sign or the altered one			2
mr @entity31 added : ' i certainly would n't have liked to have put them up - it 's a pretty steep slope so it would have been a difficult job			1
' it was fun while it lasted and i hope they can come up with something new			0
' the original sign appeared on the slopes of the pretty @entity13 near @entity5 in january the original sign was hailed by organisers of the local arts festival , @entity56 , after it mysteriously appeared on the hillside earlier this year			1
people in @entity5 have hit back at claims their local area is boring			2
they proudly boast their city is ' the street party capital of the @entity63 ' and was named one of the world â€™s top 10 cities to visit according @entity67 guides			0
top attractions include @entity70 's @entity69 , popular theatre the @entity72 , and the @entity74 shopping centre			2
the city has a history of guerilla public art - and is peppered with works by world - famous artist @entity80			0
other well - known former residents include illusionist @entity83 , model @entity84 and tv chef @entity86 ( above )			0
it was fixed to mesh fencing halfway up a rock face and the 8ft high letters became a familiar site to commuters on the busy @entity93 into the city			0
@entity56 's @entity94 , who was sent images of the original letters by street artists shortly after the word first appeared , hoped the sign would become permanent			1
he told @entity100 : ' i 'm a little bit sad that it 's gone , but that 's the nature of art like this i suppose			0
' fair play to whoever got up there , as i 'd have thought it was no mean feat. and fair play for putting the apostrophe in			0
' i do n't know what they were trying to say , whether they thought the original wording was bland or something else , because @entity5 is definitely not a bland place			0
' the famous @entity3 sign in @entity119 was unveiled in 1923 and originally spelled out ' @entity120 ' , the name of a nearby housing development			0
mr @entity94 said his group are hoping to meet the @entity27 to arrange a longer - lasting feature on the hillside site .			2
