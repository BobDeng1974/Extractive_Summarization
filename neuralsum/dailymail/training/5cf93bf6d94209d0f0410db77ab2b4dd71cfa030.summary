@entity0 has agreed to buy @entity2 coffee - and - doughnut chain @entity1 to create the world 's third - largest quick service restaurant group , with sales of about $ 23billion			1
the corporate headquarters of the new company will be in @entity2 , which may also help @entity0 lower its taxes			1
such tax inversions have been criticized by president @entity10 and @entity11 because they mean a loss of tax revenue for the @entity15 government			2
investors seemed to welcome the announcement by @entity0 late sunday that it was in talks to buy @entity1			2
the news pushed shares of both companies up more than 20 percent			0
however , some @entity0 customers are finding it hard to swallow that the home of the @entity20 will move			2
customers have been voicing their discontent with the 60 - year - old hamburger chain because of the implications for its tax bill			2
by monday afternoon , @entity0 's facebook page had more than 1,000 mostly negative comments about the deal			1
@entity41 , who had n't heard of the talks until approached by a reporter while he was at a @entity0 in @entity44 on monday afternoon , said he did n't like the idea of the company paying its taxes to another country			2
' for them to take their headquarters and move it across the border is a negative for me , ' said @entity53 , 44 , who was ordering a @entity20 and onion rings			0
' it 's an @entity15 brand			0
' customer @entity56 wrote on @entity0 's @entity58 page : ' if you attempt to buy @entity1 for the purposes of evading @entity15 taxes , i will never step foot in another @entity0 again			1
' a message from @entity64 carried a similar sentiment			0
he said : ' move to @entity2 to avoid paying taxes and i will never darken the door of a @entity0 again			1
does corporate greed in this country ever end ? shame ! ' @entity72 added his disapproving voice to the debate			1
he wrote : ' i do n't patronize corporations that engage in tax inversions , so if you do take that route , count me among the many @entity15 who will never enter one of your stores again			0
' a representative for @entity0 , @entity84 , said while the headquarters of the new company would be in @entity2 , @entity0 would still continue to be run out of @entity23			1
@entity84 also said the comments on @entity0 's facebook page represent a small fraction of the company 's more than 7 million followers on the social media site			1
@entity94 @entity15 companies , including pharmaceutical @entity95 and @entity97 , recently have pursued tax inversions to cut their costs			2
earlier this month , @entity100 abandoned plans to pursue a tax inversion after negative publicity about the planned move			0
@entity106 spokesman @entity105 would n't comment on @entity0 's announcement on monday , but said the president generally believes it 's unfair for companies to pursue a tax inversion merely to pay less in taxes			1
the @entity10 administration is considering executive steps it could take to de-incentivize inversions			0
tax purposes : the move will be a tax inversion , where one company buys another based in another country in order to lower its taxes unlike many other companies , @entity0 's move has the potential to turn off customers since it 's a brand people are so familiar with			1
it 's difficult to gauge whether such fallout would hurt the fast - food chain 's business in the @entity15 some analysts say even if some @entity0 customers are initially angered by the move , the feelings could quickly fade since there would n't be any significant changes in restaurants as a result of the deal			1
besides , many @entity0 customers who go to the chain for convenience may not care enough about the move to change their eating habits , said @entity145 , editor of @entity146 , which tracks the industry			2
' it 's going to irritate people , but basically it 's a paper move , ' he said			0
it 's not clear exactly how much a combination with @entity1 would reduce @entity0 's tax costs			1
a recent report by @entity154 found that total tax costs in @entity2 are 46.4 percent lower than in the @entity15			1
the deal will create a new holding company with 18,000 restaurants in 100 countries and about $ 22 billion in sales			1
the tie - up could help each @entity0 and @entity1 chains pose a greater challenge to market leaders such as @entity165 's and @entity166			1
it also reflects a desire by both companies to expand internationally			0
@entity0 , which has about 14,000 locations , has been striking deals to open more locations in developing markets			0
the company sees plenty of room for growth internationally , given the more than 35,000 locations @entity178 has around the world			0
@entity1 has more than 4,500 locations , mostly in @entity2			2
back in the @entity15 , breakfast and coffee have been hot growth areas in the fast - food industry			0
between 2007 and 2012 , breakfast grew faster than other segments in the restaurant industry at about 5 per cent a year , according to market researcher @entity187			0
but it has long remained a weak spot for @entity0			0
@entity165 's led the category with 31 per cent of the market in 2012 , while @entity0 had just 3 percent to 4 percent , according to @entity187			0
@entity0 's stock surged $ 5.78 , or 21 percent , to $ 32.89 on monday , while @entity1 ' stock also rose 21 percent to $ 76			1
it would n't be the first time @entity197 has paired with a @entity15 fast - food chain			2
@entity1 was purchased by @entity199 in 1995			0
in 2006 it completed an initial public offering and was spun off as a separate company .			0
