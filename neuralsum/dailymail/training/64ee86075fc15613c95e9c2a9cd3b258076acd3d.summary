@entity0 , pictured with her grandson @entity1 , died after she contracted a rare flesh - eating bug a grandmother who needed urgent amputation of her arms after she contracted a flesh - eating virus died when doctors only treated her with painkillers , the @entity4 has heard			1
@entity0 , 60 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , was struck by deadly necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on her driveway and cut her arm just before @entity16 in 2010			1
the fast - moving infection spread up her arms and into her chest and killed her within days			0
high court judge , sir @entity20 , today ruled that the @entity21 was to blame , as he detailed the inadequate care she was given at the hospital			0
he said the grandmother - of - six had arrived with her husband in ‘ excruciating pain ’ , with discoloured and swollen arms and one of them covered in weeping blisters			1
‘ the only treatment she received over the next few hours was in the form of drugs for the relief of pain and the application of gauzes to the suppurating blisters , ' he said			2
‘ what she needed was an emergency operation for the amputation of both arms and , prior to that , by way of preparation , resuscitation by means of oxygen , fluids and antibiotics			0
‘ by the time her condition was diagnosed , it was too late and death had become inevitable			1
’ mrs @entity0 ’s husband , @entity57 , sued the @entity21 , alleging an unjustified delay in her being seen by a doctor and having her blood tested			1
it meant the infection was not noticed until too late			2
by the time the decision was taken to remove her arms , it had gone too far and she had no chance			0
prior to her going into theatre , mr @entity68 only had time to wish his wife of 40 years good luck and give her a kiss			0
she died within hours on the afternoon of december 21			0
ruling the @entity21 to blame , sir @entity20 said the triage when she arrived was ‘ hopelessly inadequate ’ , as very little in the way of observations were taken			0
mrs @entity77 , pictured with her grandson @entity78 ( left ) and on her 60th birthday ( right ) , had slipped on her driveway and cut her arm just before christmas 2010			1
she died days later in hospital they were first taken almost four hours later , which was ‘ woefully late ’ , he continued			1
‘ had mrs @entity0 been treated non-negligently during and following her arrival at the hospital , she could have been ready for an amputation well before 7.30am and would then probably have survived , ’ he said			1
‘ that is , she would have lived but for the delay caused by the breaches of duty identified			0
’ he continued : ‘ i find on a balance of probability that mrs @entity0 would have survived an emergency operation for bilateral amputation and debridement for which she could and should have been ready no later than 6.10am , just over five and a half hours after she arrived			1
’ high court judge , sir @entity20 , today ruled that the @entity21 was to blame necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs			1
it can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister			0
the earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain , which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection			1
as it progresses , fever , diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious			0
the skin typically turns a dark violet colour , blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die			0
without treatment to remove the affected tissue , the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death			0
sir @entity20 ’s ruling means mr @entity68 is entitled to receive full compensation for the loss of his wife , although the amount will not be revealed			2
speaking afterwards , mr @entity68 said : ‘ @entity0 was wonderful , she was looking forward to her upcoming retirement and enjoyed cooking sunday lunches and spending time with our family			1
‘ it has been a truly horrific time for us			0
the lack of care @entity0 received from the hospital led to her being taken too soon			2
’ @entity147 , the family ’s lawyer at @entity149 from @entity150 , added : ‘ mrs @entity0 was a huge part of the lives of her whole family , and her loss has been devastating to them			2
‘ i hope that with this judgement , changes will be implemented in @entity158 to make sure patients are properly assessed as soon as they arrive and that more lives are saved from this terrifying infection and other illnesses as a result			2
