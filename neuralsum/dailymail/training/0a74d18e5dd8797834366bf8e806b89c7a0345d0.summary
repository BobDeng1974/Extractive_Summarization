@entity0 has been accused of stoking a fake controversy after last night 's climax to @entity4 's controversial assisted suicide storyline saw the terminally ill character @entity5 end her own life – without help from husband @entity8			1
critics accused the @entity0 ‘ publicity machine ’ of using a sensitive and emotive issue to generate higher ratings , with some questioning whether the soap had contributed to the debate at all			1
other critics have raised fears the episode could prompt copycat suicides by vulnerable viewers , particularly because it was shown before the 9pm watershed			2
she warned @entity8 not to touch the glass containing a lethal cocktail of painkillers to avoid implicating himself in her death			2
then , resisting his efforts to take the glass from her hand , @entity5 died in @entity8 ’s arms leaving him consumed by grief			1
however , the episode had been billed as a contribution to the ‘ right to die ’ debate , brought into the public consciousness by cases such as locked - in syndrome sufferer @entity51 , who fought for assistance to end his life in the courts			1
last night @entity56 , director of @entity57 , said : ‘ this demonstrates why soap operas are such a bad way to conduct debates on matters of public policy			2
the episode has instead been billed as a contribution to the ' right to die debate ' rather than the assisted suicide debate ‘ they turn it into a highly - charged , emotional issue , but fail to engage with the important details			1
‘ @entity0 ’s huge publicity machine has stoked up the debate around this episode well in advance to get people talking about it and to get people to tune in			1
but in fact the storyline is not quite as billed			0
in the end , it was not about assisted suicide at all			1
’ an @entity0 spokeswoman said the second episode last night , which culminated in @entity5 's death , pulled in a peak audience of 10.6 million viewers			1
more than 100,000 tweets were sent about the programme , with around 8,000 messages being tweeted every minute towards the end of the episode			0
actress @entity93 , who has played @entity5 , the soap ’s first transsexual character , for 15 years , has already been criticised for using the episode to promote her own views			1
miss @entity93 , who is a member of the @entity98 , revealed she has ‘ strong views ’ in favour of assisted dying , and said ‘ it ’s hard not to be in favour ’ of the terminally ill deciding to take their own lives			1
emotionally charged : critics argue the show failed to ' engage with the important details ' of the issue she added : ‘ i would n’t want to live in that pain and anguish or see my family and friends go through it			2
i ’ve always really understood @entity5 ’s decision			2
’ the show ’s executive producer @entity117 also defended the plot , saying : ‘ we ’re not advocates for @entity5 ’s decision and her belief that she had a right to choose a time of her dying in any way , shape or form			1
‘ will it influence people ? i do n’t know			0
people may have the discussion and talk about it			0
we have a right to have that discussion			0
’ @entity5 ’s final scenes , watched by millions last night , have reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a @entity140 hearing on the issue in may			1
@entity93 , who played the character @entity5 for 15 years , has been criticised for using the episode to promote her own personal views about the right to die @entity148 peer @entity147 , who hopes to allow patients to end their lives voluntarily with his @entity151 , reacted by calling for @entity152 to ‘ resolve the mess ’ of current legislation which makes it a crime to help others take their lives			1
assisted suicide is legal in @entity159 , the @entity160 and some @entity162 states			1
since the @entity165 assisted dying centre opened in @entity159 in 1998 , more than 180 terminally ill @entity164 people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms			1
ex-soldier @entity169 , who had motor neurone disease , became the first @entity173 to publicly go to @entity165 in 2003			0
his wife win was threatened with legal action when she returned home but was not charged			0
by @entity177 along the cobbles of @entity4 , life goes on			0
as @entity5 was slipping away in the arms of her grief - stricken husband last night , her neighbours were flirting , bickering , fixing cars and minding the shop – much as ever			1
the @entity188 ’s @entity187 would have milked this storyline for every last teardrop , with one of its trademark two - hander episodes			0
@entity0 has tried that format a couple of times , with the camera trained on two actors in a room for the full half - hour , but it ’s too melodramatic for @entity4			0
instead of a claustrophobic death for @entity5 , shut away in the flat above the cafe with her devoted @entity8 , she first saw her friends and family one last time			1
she was fervent and weepy			0
but if they gave it a second thought , they blamed her emotional state on the medication			0
only @entity8 knew that @entity5 was determined to take an overdose that evening , choosing to end her life rather than suffer a drawn - out death from incurable pancreatic cancer			1
final hours : @entity5 saw her friends and family one last time before taking her own life meanwhile , brassy @entity219 was batting her eyelashes at @entity221 , @entity218 was working up the courage to ask @entity223 to move in with him , and @entity224 was looking everywhere for his baby daughter ’s toy kangaroo			1
the first of the double episodes opened with @entity8 bringing his wife breakfast in bed for the final time			2
the scene did n’t last more than 20 seconds , as though to stay longer would be intrusive			0
even in @entity5 ’s final moments , we saw her take only the first gulp of the painkillers , before the camera cut away			2
this was the right approach			0
@entity240 might once have been a bloke , and a father at that , but she was no drama queen			0
she even ironed @entity8 ’s best shirt before she lay down , to make sure he looked his best at the funeral			2
@entity93 played it beautifully , conveying a sense that her body was in spasms of agony but her mind was calm			0
to see that pain was upsetting , because she was so convincing			0
anyone who has helplessly watched a loved one suffering torments at the end of a long illness will know how true her performance was			0
upsetting : @entity93 gave a heart - wrenching performance of @entity5 's last moments @entity262 as @entity8 was equally affecting			1
never an articulate chap , he was speechless with grief for much of the second episode , but his eyes were eloquent			0
@entity8 wanted to cry , but he could n’t			2
millions of viewers did it for him			0
with such sensitive acting , this ought to have been an unequivocal triumph , but the show ’s executive producer , @entity117 , has tarnished it in his eagerness for ratings			0
a faux controversy was whipped up in the weeks before the broadcast , about the ‘ right to die ’ debate and euthanasia			1
in fact @entity5 killed herself , with no help from anyone			2
her husband even tried to take the tumbler of drugs from her hand at the last moment , but she was determined			0
once she had swallowed the draught , he held her as she died			0
if @entity288 had really wanted to tackle the debate over assisted suicide , he should have let @entity5 linger a couple more weeks , until she was too weak to hold the glass herself			1
@entity8 could have lifted the drugs to his wife ’s lips			2
that really would have been controversial television , but the producers apparently lacked the courage for it			0
speechless with grief : @entity8 held @entity5 as she died after she drank a lethal mixture of drugs			1

terminally ill character @entity5 ended her own life on the soap
episode had prompted a *renewed* debate on assisted suicide before airing
but critics question whether the show simply stoked fake controversy for publicity as the character 's husband @entity8 did not assist her suicide
the episode is now being billed as a contribution to the ' right to die ' debate
