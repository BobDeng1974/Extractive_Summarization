by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 3 december 2013 the engineer who was at the controls during a deadly @entity4 train crash fell asleep , sources from the investigation claimed today			1
@entity7 , a 46 - year - old operator with an unblemished record in his 20 - year @entity11 career , told investigators after the crash that he had ' zoned out '			1
the @entity11 commuter train was barreling down the track at 82mph before it derailed on sunday along a sharp curve where the speed limit is 30mph			1
four passengers died and 67 were injured			0
the brakes were slammed - but it was too late to prevent disaster			0
some carriages rolled several times throwing people from them			0
three people were found dead outside the train and one person inside			1
the train came to a stop on the banks of the @entity48			0
the @entity50 investigation has revealed that six seconds before the derailment , the throttle went idle and one second later , the brakes dropped from @entity54 on the pressure gauge to zero			0
following the crash , @entity7 was tested for drugs and alcohol but it is believed that neither was found in his system			1
his cellphone has been taken for forensic analysis but it also not believed to have been a factor in the crash			1
cranes were brought in to retrieve the train carriages several of which rolled several times during the horrific collision emergency crews worked through the night on monday to return the train carriages to the tracks so it could be taken off for a full inspection a @entity11 passenger train lays on its side after derailing on sunday in the @entity77 borough of @entity4 leaving four people dead sources told @entity80 that the engineer virtually admitted that he dozed off as the train barreled at 82mph down a 70mph stretch to the 30mph zone			1
there was no immediate reasons given as to why @entity7 drifted off , with no suggestions he had been overworked or out late the previous night			1
the train engineer was released from hospital on monday night after sustaining minor injuries in the crash			1
he is said to be thoroughly traumatized by the horrific crash and cooperating with the investigation			0
' he 's a sincere human being with an impeccable record that i know of			0
he 's diligent and competent , ' @entity96 , executive director of the rail employees union said			0
@entity7 has been an engineer for about 11 years and a @entity11 employee for about 20 years , he said			1
the lead car in the @entity11 train derailment is pulled from the marsh in the @entity77 borough of @entity4 the revelation that the commuter train , which was traveling from @entity105 to @entity4 , derailed while barreling into a sharp curve at nearly three times the speed limit is fueling questions about whether automated crash - avoidance technology could have prevented the carnage			1
safety officials have championed what 's known as positive train control technology for decades but the railroad industry has sought to postpone having to install it because of the high cost and technological issues			2
investigators have n't yet determined whether the weekend wreck , which killed four people and injured more than 60 others , was the result of human error or mechanical trouble			1
but some safety experts said the tragedy might not have happened if @entity11 had the technology , and a senator said the derailment underscored the need for it			1
' this incident , if anything , heightens the importance of additional safety measures , like that one , ' said @entity137 senator @entity136 , a @entity138 from @entity139 , which also is served by @entity11			2
' i 'd be very loath to be more flexible or grant more time			0
' federal authorities began righting the cars on monday morning as they started an exhaustive investigation into what caused a @entity11 commuter train rounding a riverside curve to derail , killing four people the train was going 82 mph as it entered a 30 mph turn sunday morning and ran off the track , @entity50 member @entity149 said on monday			1
he cited information extracted from the train 's two data recorders ; investigators also began interviewing the train 's crew			2
the speed stunned officials - ' i gulped , ' said @entity137 senator @entity161 , ( @entity138 - @entity4 )			1
governor @entity162 said the @entity50 findings make it clear ' extreme speed was a central cause ' of the derailment and vowed to ' make sure any responsible parties are held accountable ' after investigators determine why the train was going so fast			1
' at this point in time , we ca n't tell ' whether the answer is faulty brakes or a human mistake , @entity149 said			0
@entity149 sketched a scenario suggesting that the throttle was let up and the brakes were fully applied way too late to stave off the crash			0
he said the throttle went to idle six seconds before the derailed train came to a complete stop - ' very late in the game ' for a train going that fast - and the brakes were fully engaged five seconds before the train stopped			2
it takes about a quarter - mile to a half - mile to stop a train going 82 mph , according to @entity189 , a @entity190 spokesman			2
first responders work the scene of a derailment of a @entity11 passenger train			1
the train was traveling at 82mph when it went into a 30mph curve sending the carriages careening off the tracks investigators are not aware of any problems with the brakes during the nine stops the train made before the derailment , mr @entity149 said			1
positive train control , or @entity206 , is designed to forestall the human errors that cause about 40 per cent of train accidents , and uses @entity209 , wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding , derailing or going the wrong way			0
the transportation safety board has urged railroads to install @entity206 in some form since 1970 , and after a 2005 head - on collision killed 25 people near @entity219 , @entity220 in 2008 ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by december 2015			1
@entity11 has taken steps toward acquiring it but , like many rail lines , has advocated for a few more years to implement a costly system that railroads say presents technological and other hurdles			2
@entity228 , a former @entity190 safety official , said a @entity206 system would have prevented sunday 's crash if the brakes were working normally			2
and @entity232 , a former @entity190 official who teaches at @entity233 , said the technology would have monitored the brakes and would not have allowed the train to exceed the speed limit			2
@entity238 , 58 , a married father - of - four was killed in sunday morning 's @entity239 as the engineer made his way into @entity4 to work on the @entity243 lighting @entity244 ( pictured left ) , a paralegal , was one of the four people killed in the horrific train crash on sunday in @entity4			1
nurse @entity247 , 35 , ( pictured right ) was also died ' a properly installed @entity206 system would have prevented this train from crashing , ' he said			2
' if the engineer would not have taken control of slowing the train down , the @entity206 system would have			0
' the @entity255 , which runs @entity11 , began planning for a @entity206 system as soon as the law was put into effect , spokeswoman @entity254 said			2
after some early - stage work such as buying radio frequencies , the @entity255 awarded $ 428 million in contracts in september to develop the system for @entity11 and its sister @entity264			1
but the @entity255 has advocated for an extension to 2018 , saying it 's difficult to install such a system across more than 1,000 rail cars and 1,200 miles of track			0
' it 's not a simple , off - the - shelf solution , ' @entity270 said on monday			0
on sunday , the train was about half full , with about 150 people aboard , when it ran off the rails while rounding a bend where the @entity48 and @entity278 rivers meet			2
the lead car landed inches from the water			0
the dead were identified as @entity283 , 54 , of @entity284 ; @entity285 , 58 , of @entity286 ; @entity287 , 59 , of @entity288 ; and @entity247 , 35 , of @entity289			0
some of the injured remained hospitalized monday , including seven in intensive care at one hospital and two patients in critical condition at another			0
the train was configured with its locomotive in the back instead of the front			0
@entity149 said that is common , and a train 's brakes work the same way no matter where the locomotive is located			0
@entity232 said the locomotive 's location has virtually no effect on train safety			0
still , some people feel the configuration provides less protection for passengers because if the train hits something , there 's no locomotive in front to absorb the blow , said @entity319 , executive director of the permanent citizens @entity320 to the @entity255 , a riders ' advocacy group			2
the derailment came amid a troubled year for @entity11 , and marked the first time in the railroad 's 31 - year history that a passenger was killed in an accident			1
in may , a train derailed in @entity331 , @entity139 , and was struck by a train coming in the opposite direction , injuring 73 passengers , two engineers and a conductor			0
in july , a freight train full of garbage derailed near the site of sunday 's wreck .			0

@entity7 , 46 , told investigators that he ' zoned out ' moments before derailment which killed 4 people and left dozens injured
@entity11 commuter train from @entity105 to @entity4 was traveling at 82mph as it entered a 30mph curve
@entity7 not believed to have drank alcohol , taken drugs or used his phone
