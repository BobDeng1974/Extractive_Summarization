a @entity2 tea party group sued the @entity3 on monday , saying it was among the conservative organizations the federal government targeted for special scrutiny because of its political positions			1
the lawsuit , filed in @entity9 in @entity10 , seeks the certification of a class action , which could open the floodgates for as many as 300 other right - wing groups to join the legal effort			2
@entity17 @entity16 , based in @entity18 , @entity2 , told the court that the @entity3 discriminated against it because of the beliefs of its members , subjecting it to ' a lengthy and costly delay in recognition of their tax - exempt status , and the required disclosure of the personal political beliefs , writings , thoughts , and activities ' of its members			1
@entity17 's website describes its members as ' volunteers who simply love their country and want to save it from a tyrannical takeover			1
' @entity38 , the group 's founding president , told @entity40 in @entity41 last week that the @entity3 made unreasonable demands when she applied for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status for the organization			1
' they wanted every email i had ever sent out , ' she said			0
' they wanted the transcripts of every speech from any speaker at any event , meeting or anything that we had had			0
for more than two years during the @entity62 presidency , the agency targeted conservative groups for unusual auditing when they applied for tax - exempt status @entity17 has organized protests at the @entity2 state capitol , events that the @entity3 asked about , demanding copies of leaflets and letters to legislators like hundreds of other groups , she waited for more than two years while her application sat in the @entity3 's @entity10 office , never hearing from the agency why it was being delayed			1
@entity17 's tax - exempt status was granted in august 2012 , nearly 29 months after the application was filed			1
the delays were unreasonable , according to the federal lawsuit , ' because if their tax - exempt status had been ultimately denied they would have been forced to retroactively file tax returns and pay taxes and penalties for up to two years while their applications were pending			1
' in addition to the @entity3 , @entity17 's lawsuit leaves open the possibility of naming as many as 100 ' @entity92 ' defendants , allowing for the future addition of individual government officials and political figures			1
the group says the @entity3 violated the @entity97 , which prohibits federal government agencies from keeping more records than they need to fulfill the legal requirements of their missions			1
the @entity97 also requires the @entity3 to ' maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the @entity105 ' unless a federal law requires it , or the individual gives permission			2
@entity10 attorney @entity109 filed the lawsuit on @entity17 's behalf , he works with @entity111 , a ' @entity113 moral values ' group that crusades against pornographers and strip clubs the @entity3 demanded the answers to an extensive list of questions from @entity17 , similar to those seen by other tea party groups , requiring it to turn over copies of leaflets distributed at all its rallies , letters it sent to members of @entity126 , the names of all its donors and the amounts they contributed			1
in its lawsuit , @entity17 also claimed the @entity3 violated its rights under the @entity132 to the @entity134 @entity133			1
' [ @entity136 ] he @entity3 engaged in systematic discrimination based upon the speech , expressed viewpoints , and association of @entity58 , its members , and similarly situated groups , ' according to the lawsuit			2
' it subjected them to harassment , unfair delay , denial of governmental benefits , and impaired their ability to participate in the political process			0
' it 's unusual for class actions to be certified against the @entity134 government , and @entity17 's effort could be hamstrung by the fact that while the @entity3 centrally managed the tax - exempt application process from its @entity10 office , some tea party groups received demand letters from offices in other states			1
at least two groups received letters from @entity3 offices in @entity2 , and another received letters from an @entity3 office in @entity168 @entity16 groups in more than 40 states could ultimately join the class - action lawsuit against the @entity3 if a federal judge rules that it can proceed @entity17 @entity16 says it 's a grassroots group composed of ' volunteers who simply love their country and want to save it from a tyrannical takeover ' @entity17 's attorneys are standard - bearers on the @entity113 conservative wing of @entity179 politics			1
@entity10 attorney @entity109 represents @entity111 , a group whose goals are to ' promote @entity113 moral values and to reduce destructive behaviors contrary to those values			0
' among its efforts is a campaign against pornographers and what it calls ' sexually - oriented businesses			0
' @entity190 , @entity17 's other lawyer , is allied with the @entity191 , a group best - known for defending public prayer in court cases nationwide , and for pushing back against same - sex marriage initiatives			2
@entity109 and @entity195 did n't immediately respond to requests for comment , nor did the @entity3 's press office			0
citizens for @entity200 , a conservative group that says it aims to ' return @entity134 governmental power to the people ' and disperse power and break the cycle of incumbency , ' issued a statement of support for he legal effort on monday			0
that group 's founder , @entity210 , is also a co-founder of @entity16 , a group with national reach			2
he said that ' [ w ] e stand shoulder to shoulder with all those known and unknown who have been abused by a federal government run amok			0
' @entity217 told @entity219 host @entity218 that federal government agencies contacted her 17 times with audit and lists of questions after she sought tax - exempt status for her tea party and for a voting rights organization ' is this @entity229 ? ' congressman @entity230 slammed former @entity3 acting commissioner @entity231 for presiding over the political persecution of @entity233 , one of his @entity235 constituents @entity17 's lawsuit comes as @entity126 is pressuring senior @entity3 personnel , past and present , for answers about how @entity134 's tax collectors came to target citizens of one political persuasion for intensive audits before awarding tax - exempt status			1

@entity231 and @entity247 have already appeared before the @entity253 , testifying friday			0
during that hearing , @entity235 @entity230 rep. @entity230 stunned the gallery by asking aloud , ' is this still @entity134 ? ' @entity230 told the story of @entity217 , whose conservative voting rights group @entity259 and tea party group @entity258 were among the organizations targeted by federal authorities after it applied for tax - exempt status			1
tea party groups were on the rise and poised to return republicans to power in @entity126 in 2010 , when the @entity3 's alleged abuses began			1
@entity17 's website claims groups like it were hamstrung by a politically motivated @entity62 administration that used its tax authority to push back against its ideological adversaries @entity233 , her organization and her small business , he said , were subject to 17 separate inquiries and audits from federal government agencies			1
' she received four @entity284 inquires , ' @entity230 said , ' and her business received unsolicited audits - unscheduled audits			0
' in ' the first contact we had from the @entity3 , in the first general round of questions , ' @entity233 told @entity219 host @entity218 , ' they wanted to see every @entity293 posting we had made , every tweet we tweeted			0
' ' at some point those questions cross the line			0
' both president @entity62 and his chief spokesman , @entity297 , have been hounded by journalists on the question of what senior @entity301 staffers knew about the @entity3 scandal and when they knew it			2

it emerged hours later , however , that @entity231 's term as acting commissioner was already scheduled to end in early june @entity17 's @entity38 told @entity40 that she believes @entity62 will find a scapegoat to protect himself and his legacy			2
' i think he 's been caught with his hand in the cookie jar , ' she said , ' and so he 's going to say , " oh yeah , shame on them			2
" and it 's going to be somebody else 's fault			0
' if the lawsuit survives a motion for dismissal , its fate will rest with a judge picked from among the southern @entity340 district 's eight full - time jurists			0
four of them are @entity343 appointees , three were appointed by @entity344 , and one was appointed by president @entity62			2
