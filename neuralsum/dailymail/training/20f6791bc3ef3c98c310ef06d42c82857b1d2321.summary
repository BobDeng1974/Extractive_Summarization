@entity2 's @entity1 rover vehicle drove onto the moon 's surface sunday after the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades , a huge advance in the country 's ambitious space programme			1
the ' @entity1 ' , or @entity1 , was deployed at 4:35 am ( 8.35pm gmt ) on saturday , several hours after the @entity10 probe landed on the moon , said the official news agency @entity12 it is the latest stage in @entity2 's bold space ambition to eventually have a @entity2 astronaut set foot on the moon			1
@entity2 is the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the @entity40 and the then - @entity41 - a decade after it first sent an astronaut into space			1
the mission is seen as a symbol of @entity2 's rising global stature and technological advancement , as well as the @entity48 's success in reversing the fortunes of the once - impoverished nation			1
@entity51 plans to establish a permanent space station by 2020			0
colour images showing the @entity2 national flag on the rover were transmitted live to the @entity57 where @entity2 president @entity58 congratulated the mission , the agency said			2
descent : footage taken by a camera on the bottom of @entity10 lunar probe as it descends onto the surface of the moon over the moon : staff at the @entity57 celebrate the successful landing the potential to extract the moon 's resources has been touted as a key reason behind @entity51 's space programme , with the moon believed to hold uranium , titanium , and other mineral resources , as well as offering the possibility of solar power generation			1
' @entity2 wants to go to the moon for geostrategic reasons and domestic legitimacy , ' said @entity2 space expert @entity84 , a professor of national security affairs at the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89			1
' with the @entity40 exploration moribund at best , that opens a window for @entity2 to be perceived as the global technology leader - though the @entity40 still has more , and more advanced , assets in space			2
' a message from the party 's @entity100 , the @entity97 - @entity2 's cabinet - , and the @entity98 branded the touchdown a ' milestone ' in @entity2 's space programme , as cited by @entity12 late sunday			1
the lunar probe began to carry out soft - landing on the moon at 9 pm @entity2 time on saturday and touched down in @entity25 , or the @entity25 , 11 minutes later , according to the @entity57			1
during the process , the probe decelerated from 15km ( nine miles ) above the moon , stayed hovering at 100 yards from the lunar surface in order to use sensors to assess the landing area and avoid obstacles , and descended slowly onto the surface			2
launch : the december 2 launch of the carrier rocket , the vehicle for @entity2 's first moon rover mission , blasting off after midnight in @entity121 in southwest @entity2 's @entity123 province the success makes @entity2 the third country , after the @entity40 and the @entity41 , to soft - land ( a powered , controlled descent ) on the moon			1
the last soft - landing was carried out by the @entity41 in 1976			2
the probe 's landing is the most difficult task during the mission , said @entity133 , the lunar program 's chief designer , according to the @entity12 news agency			0
' it 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world , ' said @entity139 , consultant editor for @entity140 and @entity141			0
' especially somewhere like the moon , which does n't have an atmosphere so you ca n't use parachutes or anything like that			0
' you have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you do n't end up in a crater on top of a large rock			0
' state - run @entity157 showed a computer - generated image of the @entity10 lander 's path as it approached the surface of the moon , explaining that for about a 12 - minute landing period it would have no contact with @entity164			1
as it was just hundreds of metres away , the lander 's camera broadcast images of the moon 's surface			1
the @entity10 's solar panels , which are used to absorb sunlight to generate power , opened soon after the landing			2
the @entity10 will set up antennae to transmit pictures back to @entity164			0
@entity10 relied on automated systems for descent , range and velocity measurements , finding the proper landing point , and free - falling			2
path : a chart showing @entity184 's approach to the moon before soft - landing on the surface state - run @entity157 showed a computer - generated image of the @entity10 lander 's path as it approached the surface of the moon tension : a giant electronic screen displays the mission operation information of @entity2 's @entity10 lunar probe as researchers work at the @entity57 @entity10 adopted a variable thrust engine designed and made by @entity2 scientists			1
its thrust power ranges from 1,500 to 7,500 newtons , according to @entity133			0
the soft - landing was carried out 12 days after the probe blasted off on an enhanced @entity202 carrier rocket			0
@entity2 's military - backed space programme has made methodical progress in a relatively short time , although it lags far behind the @entity40 and @entity206 in technology and experience			1
@entity2 sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming the third nation after @entity206 and the @entity40 to achieve manned space travel independently			2
in 2006 , it sent its first probe to the moon			0
@entity2 plans to open a space station around 2020 and send an astronaut to the moon after that			2
' they are taking their time with getting to know about how to fly humans into space , how to build space stations ... how to explore the solar system , especially the moon and @entity226 , ' said @entity139 , consultant editor for @entity228			0
' they are making good strides , and i think over the next 10 , 20 years they 'll certainly be rivalling @entity206 and @entity40 in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas			0
' @entity10 includes a lander and a moon rover called ' @entity1 ' or @entity1			1
@entity1 's tasks include surveying the moon 's geological structure and surface substances and searching for natural resources			1
the lander will operate there for one year while the rover will be active for three months			0
@entity10 is part of the second phase of @entity2 's lunar programme , which includes orbiting , landing and returning to the @entity164			1
it follows the success of the @entity249 and @entity250 missions in 2007 and 2010			0
@entity251 , deputy engineer - in - chief in charge of the project , said : ' compared to the last century 's space race between the @entity40 and the @entity258 , mankind 's current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe			2
' ' @entity2 's lunar program is an important component of mankind 's activities to explore peaceful use of space			1
' the moon is one of the most important themes in @entity2 literature and ancient myths , including one about @entity250 , a lady who took her pet ' @entity1 ' to fly to the moon , where she became a goddess			1
' though people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate , it does n't change its splendid role in @entity2 traditional culture , ' said @entity282 , a professor with @entity283			2
' apart from scientific exploration , the lunar probe is a response to @entity2 's traditional culture and imagination			1
@entity2 's lunar programme will proceed with the beautiful legends , ' @entity282 said			1

@entity297 's state tv said that the launch of the rocket dubbed @entity308 , or @entity309 in @entity310 , was @entity297 's first use of liquid fuel and reached a height of 120 kilometres ( 72 miles )			0
it said the monkey , named @entity315 or @entity316 , was returned to earth safely			0
the tv showed the rocket blasting off and then showed the monkey , strapped snugly into a seat , staring at people clapping to celebrate its safe return			0
the report said @entity315 's capsule parachuted safely to earth after detaching from the rocket in a mission that lasted 15 minutes			0
@entity297 frequently claims technological breakthroughs that are impossible to independently verify			0
the @entity329 has said it seeks to send an astronaut into space as part of an ambitious aerospace programme			0
' the launch of @entity308 is another long step getting the @entity297 closer to sending a man into space , ' the official @entity335 news agency said			0
a computer - generated image shows the craft 's trajectory the moon looms over the @entity344 in @entity51			0
@entity2 has ambitious plans for space exploration @entity315 , the monkey @entity297 claims it sent into space and then safely returned			2

@entity351 rover called ' @entity1 ' or @entity1 left @entity10 on saturday night
