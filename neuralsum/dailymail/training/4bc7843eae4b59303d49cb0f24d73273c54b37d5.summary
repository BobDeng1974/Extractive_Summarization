the first live hamstring transplant in @entity1 – in which a mother donated her tendon to repair her injured daughter ’s knee – has been performed by @entity7 surgeons			1
the success of the operation paves the way for a new approach to treating the common problem of damaged knees			2
@entity14 , 11 , injured her knee during a skiing session on a dream family holiday to @entity18 in 2011			1
‘ at first we were n’t too worried , ’ says her mother @entity19 , 37			1
‘ @entity14 has a high pain threshold and was happy to ski again straight away once the medics had checked her over			1
she was limping a bit , but not in distress			0
’ a mother 's gift : @entity14 , 11 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , can ski again thanks to her mother @entity19 , 37 it was only a couple of weeks later and back at home in @entity27 , @entity28 , that @entity19 asked her doctor to take a look at @entity14 ’s knee , which was still swollen and painful			1
they were immediately referred to consultant orthopaedic surgeon @entity35 at @entity36 , who diagnosed her with a torn anterior cruciate ligament ( @entity40 ) – a very common knee injury			1
the ligament runs diagonally from the front of the shin to the back of the thigh and helps control the knee ’s rotation			1
injuring the acl seriously affects limb stability			0
it is thought to happen to one in every 600 people each year			0
‘ an increasing number of young people are suffering this injury , ’ says consultant knee surgeon and @entity40 specialist @entity54 , a colleague of mr @entity35 at @entity55 and @entity57 ’s @entity56 in @entity58			2
‘ they are increasingly taking to contact sports or skiing , which are high - risk activities for such injuries			2
’ the most popular option for acl reconstruction is using the patient ’s own hamstrings , taking tendons from the back of their thighs to create a new ligament			2
the largest one is left behind to maintain hamstring function			2
how the operation was done the other option is an allograft , in which ligaments are transplanted from a deceased donor			2
using living parental ( or other family member ) tissue , first attempted in @entity84 20 years ago , means there is no risk of rejection			0
in august @entity14 and @entity19 were admitted to @entity88 where they were operated on in separate theatres under general anaesthetic			1
an inch - long incision was made a little less than an inch below @entity19 ’s inside knee , and the hamstring – like a ribbon of smoked salmon – was removed from where it anchors to the bone			1
this procedure took between six and eight minutes			0
the hamstring was then folded into four and stitched together to form a new acl using a technique introduced to the @entity7 by mr @entity35			0
it was packaged up and immediately transferred to the adjacent theatre to be transplanted into @entity14			1
using minute keyhole incisions , @entity14 ’s damaged @entity40 was removed			1
holes were drilled in the femur and tibia ( bones in the leg ) and the donated graft was then threaded through her knee cavity			2
the graft was fixed to the bones with tiny metal buttons which sit in the drilled holes			0
the whole procedure took about an hour			0
acl reconstruction is rarely performed on children because of the risk of growth abnormalities and deformity , as well as the increased challenges of surgery due to their smaller anatomy			0
the condition is traditionally managed with a leg brace and physiotherapy			0
but with increasing numbers of @entity40 injuries , doctors are keen to find an effective treatment			0
the two surgeons say better education of @entity135 and @entity136 doctors is also needed , as the diagnosis is often missed in the early stages			0
‘ such injuries are generally not seen by a specialist until three to 12 months after they occur , ’ says mr @entity35			0
‘ by this time the patient is likely to have suffered a secondary injury			0
’ it took 18 months after the accident for @entity14 to have the operation as a special licence was required for the live tissue donation			1
but the results have been remarkable			0
‘ @entity14 was n’t in pain , but the first couple of days were a struggle as she did n’t believe that she could straighten the leg again after 18 months of pain and being unable to , ’ says @entity19			1
now , less than three months after surgery , @entity14 ’s leg is almost back to normal			2
‘ she was n’t lucky at all to have a knee injury , ’ says @entity19 , ‘ but she was very lucky to have those two doctors working on her			1

@entity14 , 11 , injured her knee while skiing in @entity18 in 2011
her mother @entity19 , 37 , donated her hamstring for the operation
thanks to @entity19 , surgeons were able to repair @entity14 's torn ligament
