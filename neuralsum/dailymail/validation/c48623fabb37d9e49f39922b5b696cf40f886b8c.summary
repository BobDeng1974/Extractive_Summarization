a mother has described how she heard a doctor asking her husband about switching off her life - support as she lay in a medically - induced coma after collapsing from a rare condition			1
@entity6 , who was feared to have catastrophic brain damage after going into cardiac arrest , lay listening to the life - or - death conversation but was paralysed and unable to intervene			1
she recalls her husband @entity10 ruling out ending her life – despite a previous conversation when she said she wanted to die if incapacitated permanently			1
the 40 - year - old later recovered and now says she is relieved he went against her wishes			1
near death : @entity6 , 40 , pictured , was in a coma in hospital but heard doctors discuss ending her life only for her husband to refuse to switch off her life support machine much - loved : mrs @entity6 , pictured with her son @entity21 and husband @entity10 , had said she would want her life support switched off , but mr @entity24 refused to give up on her ‘ i was aware of conversations around me , ’ she said			1
‘ the most frequent one was being turned in the bed			2
a familiar “ ready , steady , turn ” would come from the nurses			2
‘ the most alarming was between a doctor and my husband enquiring as to my wishes surrounding being kept alive on a ventilator and that they were unsure whether my mental ability had been impaired due to lack of oxygen while they were attempting to restart my heart			1
starting again : a year on from her near - death experience @entity24 is back at work and also took part in a charity run , pictured ‘ there was an agreement that i should continue to be kept on the ventilator to give a chance for an mri scan to be done to see if i had any brain function			2
‘ i was not even responding to a basic reflex test , which is why the doctor thought i was not going to have a chance of recovery			2
i am very pleased my husband gave me that extra time			1
’ mrs @entity6 , a government building surveyor , felt pins and needles in her legs on march 14 last year but still went to work			1
she was alone in a tower block in central @entity60 when she collapsed as the pain moved up her legs			0
she managed to catch a train home to @entity64 , @entity65 , and went to her gp who immediately sent her to @entity68 and @entity69 with a letter saying she might have @entity72 syndrome			1
the condition involves the immune system attacking the peripheral nervous system – the network of nerves outside the central nervous system – leaving the brain unable to control muscles			1
she and her husband claim the letter was handed over but not acted upon and she was initially told she had a chest complaint			2
hours later she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest			0
she was given a tracheotomy to help her breathe and was placed in a light medically - induced coma			2
she was on a respirator in an intensive care unit when a doctor raised the subject of ending her life a few days later			2
mr @entity24 , 58 , who is also a surveyor , explained : ‘ he said they did n’t know how long she was deprived of oxygen and there could be a range of deficits and it could be time to turn the machine off			0
i said it was far too early			0
‘ he said , “ we have got to be realistic about what might happen , ” but again i said it was too early			0
’ new life : mrs @entity6 , pictured left and right during her recovery , had been minutes from death before she was diagnosed with rare autoimmune disease of the nervous system @entity72 while in intensive care @entity24 was finally diagnosed with @entity72			1
doctors realised she had a chance of surviving if kept in the coma to allow her body to repair itself			1
she was given intravenous immunoglobulin and had a plasma exchange			0
shortly after returning home she began taking her five - year - old son , @entity21 , to school with the aid of a walking frame			0
now , one year on , she is back at work and has completed a 5km charity run , negotiating the course while leaning on a walking stick			0
the couple have made a formal complaint to the hospital about the @entity66 ’s letter being ignored			0
a hospital spokesman said : ‘ we are glad that mrs @entity6 is recovering from her illness			1
however , we are sorry she did not have a positive patient experience			0
we are investigating the concerns raised			0
’ renowned neurosurgeon @entity138 said : ‘ sometimes the sedation wears off a bit , so she might have been hearing some of the conversations around her			0
‘ but some of the drugs like opiates [ she may have been prescribed ] can in some cases induce hallucinations			0
so it could be she was in a dream - like state and imagined what was happening			0
