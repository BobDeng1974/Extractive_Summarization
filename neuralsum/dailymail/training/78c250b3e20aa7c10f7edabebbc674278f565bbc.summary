@entity1 boss @entity0 insisted that their @entity3 hopes remained alive and well despite 1 - 0 defeat by @entity6 at his old stomping ground			1
@entity0 , who confessed that the ‘ frenetic ’ encounter at @entity9 had been far from easy on the eye , is now pinning his hopes on a run of home games — including @entity6 ’s visit to @entity15 next june — to regain momentum			1
‘ that ’s us and @entity6 on seven points each , ’ said the former @entity18 manager			1
‘ in truth , our own fate will depend on what happens in the @entity25			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 confessed that the ' frenetic ' encounter had been far from easy on the eye ‘ we ’ve got four of the next five games at home			1
we ’ve had a difficult run , three away games and one at home — seven points on the board			1
‘ with @entity41 winning in @entity42 and @entity43 still the strongest team in the group , it ’s going to be tough			1
‘ everything is to play for			1
i would have believed that if we ’d come out of this game unscathed			2
‘ we have to get ourselves together			2
if we ’re talking about our next competitive match in march , we ’ve got to get ourselves together and be ready for @entity41			2
we are absolutely still in this , without a doubt			2
’ @entity0 confessed that @entity51 - born winger @entity50 , booed every time he touched the ball , had made a less dramatic than expected impact on the game , saying : ‘ i think that @entity64 , like a number of players here , for the sort of form he has shown for us in the games , he would have been a bit frustrated tonight			1
‘ i have n’t spoken to him about that ( the booing ) but , for the form he has shown in recent times for us , the match he won for us in @entity42 , i think he had a frustrating time			2
@entity0 , @entity74 and @entity75 on the touchline at @entity9 ‘ the atmosphere obviously was great			1
but this was n’t a return to @entity18			2
it had a totally different feel to it			2
‘ last night , when i came up here and walked on to the pitch , it might have evoked a few memories			1
but today i was totally focused on trying to get something out of the game			2
’ addressing his own team ’s fairly brutal performance , the @entity1 boss added : ‘ i do n’t think either of the teams were able to get it down and play			1
after the first 10 or 15 minutes of the game , it kept developing in that style			2
‘ @entity6 did n’t get hold of it , either			1
we were n’t able to do so			2
it ’s a tough contest			2
we ’ve been talking about if for weeks , that it would be a derby game , a derby atmosphere			0
‘ it had those ingredients			0
neither team could keep possession long enough			0
‘ whether that was because of the atmosphere , maybe a bit of nervousness , it applied to both teams			0
we ’re disappointed because i thought we had opportunities to get it and play , despite the atmosphere			0
we were unable to do so			0
‘ we ’ve conceded a goal after they ’d forced corner – but i thought we were comfortable			0
we conceded from a set - piece			1
@entity1 's @entity50 made a less dramatic than expected impact on the game ‘ i thought it was a frenetic match			1
stop - start a lot of times , littered with fouls			1
just like a derby in many aspects			0
but i thought we were going to get something out of the game			0
‘ i felt the first goal would win			0
the two sides cancelled each other out , to coin the old phrase			0
i thought we were not in phenomenal danger when the goal occurred			0
’ the defeat comes at the end of a difficult week for @entity0 , who has lost key players to injury — and been distracted by allegations of @entity74 getting involved in an incident with a fan at the team hotel			1
‘ the @entity74 incident has genuinely not bothered me , ’ he insisted			0
‘ it ’s a distraction , that ’s not a problem			0
‘ the injuries are part of the game			0
you curse your luck and get on with it			0
we had players out there tonight capable of winning the game , never mind coming out of it unscathed			0
top scorer @entity159 started on the bench in favour of @entity162 @entity74 came on as late substitute but could not affect the outcome ‘ we lost it , the game was on a knife edge , it could have gone either way			1
when @entity6 scored , even they might have been thinking a draw would have been fair			1
’ defending his decision to drop top scorer @entity159 in favour of @entity162 , @entity0 said : ‘ i make decisions for the good of the team			1
@entity159 accepted it because we were playing away from home and wanted to stretch the game			1
’ meanwhile , @entity1 defender @entity181 vowed the @entity182 would bounce back from the set - back			1
‘ we have to regroup now , ’ said the @entity185 man			0
‘ we came here wanting to win the game but we would have been happy if we had left with a point in the end			0
‘ but unfortunately we switched off for the corner and they scored			0
‘ it is a horrible feeling			0
i know we pushed them back towards the end but it was not good enough and we ’re all disappointed			0
‘ it ’s a tough group , we knew it was going to be and we expected every game to be difficult			0

@entity0 *upbeat* despite 1 - 0 defeat by @entity6 on *friday* night
@entity1 have four of next five @entity3 *qualifiers* at home
