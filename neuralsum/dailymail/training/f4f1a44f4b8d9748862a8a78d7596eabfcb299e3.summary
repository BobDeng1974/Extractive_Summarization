’ he went on to give mrs @entity41 - who is widely expected to be the @entity73 presidential candidate when mr @entity1 ’s second term ends in 2016 - a shout out as well			2

former @entity187 editor @entity10 , who came to fame with his work during the @entity190 , was another notable inclusion			0
the president joked that in addition to mr @entity10 ’s military service and important work in the media , he was also jealous of how the editor is able to pull off fashion - forward shirts with white collars			0
‘ he always looks so cool in them , ’ mr @entity1 joked			0
old friends : senator @entity176 and @entity1 worked together when he first entered the national political scene and the @entity55 from @entity202 took the @entity204 - transplant under his wing partners in stride : mrs @entity208 also attended the ceremony but she did not speak not to be outdone , the vertibale ‘ queen of all media ’ was also a recipient of the storied award			1
@entity8 has been a longstanding supporter of the president , though many believed that their relationship may have soured after she did little to endorse him during the 2012 re-election campaign and skipped his second inauguration entirely			0
