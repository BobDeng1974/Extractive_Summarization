a translated caption with the photo is " @entity68 " in the case of @entity71 of @entity72 , another accused former @entity6 guard , a judge allowed him to stay in the @entity7 reasoning in part that because @entity71 had joined the @entity26 at age 17 , he could n't be held responsible for what he did as a minor			1
federal prosecutors , however , say that even if @entity3 did n't kill anyone , his work as a concentration camp guard makes him a party to the persecution of countless men , women and children , no matter how long ago that happened			1
@entity3 escorted prisoners to slave labor sites and was under orders to shoot any prisoners who attempted to escape			1

@entity128 , the senior historian at the @entity129 , said that it 's ‘ very difficult ’ to tell whether any particular individual actually volunteered for the @entity26 , or was pressured to join			2
but he said the guards were essential to the concentration camp system			0
‘ even if they do n't have any contact with a prisoner , by walking the perimeter as an armed guard , they are helping to keep the people inside that place where they are enduring persecution , ’ @entity128 said , adding that @entity26 guards were paid , got leave time , and health benefits for their service			2

the legal question is ‘ about when people are dragged into assisting the persecutions involuntarily , ’ @entity104 said , referring to an asylum case involving an @entity176 man who said he was forced to guard prisoners in @entity178			0
