the @entity3 study showed supplements of of purified @entity6 oil , the key fatty acid found in anchovies , could reduce harmful blood fats and boost ' good ' cholestrol anchovies could hold the key to cutting risk factors for heart disease and stroke			1
an extract of omega oil found in them reduced levels of harmful blood fats and boosted ‘ good ’ cholesterol			1
the findings come from the first human trial of supplements of purified @entity6 oil , the key fatty acid found in anchovies			1
after just a month volunteers were found to have a 44 per cent cut in c - reactive protein ( @entity26 ) , a marker of inflammation in the blood , along with triglycerides and bad ldl cholesterol			1
experts say the health benefits of palmitoleic acid , the prime @entity6 acid , are only just emerging			2
dr @entity35 , who led the @entity3 study , said ‘ i think the major benefit come from decreasing inflammation as well as a beneficial effect on other contributing risk factors to cardiovascular disease , with no side effects that we know of			0
’ dr @entity35 , professor of medicine and head of the @entity47 at the @entity48 , said ‘ the trial showed inflammatory markers were reduced and the effect on good fats was a bonus			1
‘ there seems to be a lot of benefit and not much risk – this could help us tackle some of the factors made worse by obesity that can lead to heart disease , ’ he added			0
in the study , 60 adult volunteers were randomly assigned to take 220mg of palmitoleic acid once a day or an inactive supplement for 30 days			0
those taking part had mildly raised levels of blood fats and inflammation			1
after the study tests showed a 44 per cent reduction in @entity26 , 15 per cent cut in triglycerides and eight per cent fall in ldl cholesterol – all factors linked to heart disease			0
levels of @entity81 – a good form of cholesterol – rose five per cent compared with those taking dummy capsules			1
the trial , published by the @entity87 , was funded by @entity88 which provided the experimental capsules called @entity90			0
@entity90 is available in the @entity91 as @entity92 , a new brand of @entity6 concentrated wild anchovy oil			2
unlike the better known polyunsaturated fatty acids known as omega - 3s , omega - 7s are monounsaturated fats and they have different mechanisms of action			0
but to get the same effect from anchovies alone would mean eating a can of the fish a day @entity105 acid was found by scientists at @entity107 in 2008 to be the first fatty acid to act as a hormone in the body			2
it plays an important role in regulating metabolism and appears to protect against harmful processes associated with obesity - related diseases such as diabetes			0
dr @entity35 , who chairs the scientific advisory board for @entity88 , said people would have to eat around a can of anchovies a day to get the same amount of omega 7 oil from a daily dose of supplements			1
‘ that ’s a reasonable amount of anchovies every day if you like them , but some people find it simpler and more convenient to take supplements ’ he added			2
