@entity1 leader @entity32 said : ‘ we have got a long way to go in terms of our fundraising but we are getting there			1
‘ to overhaul the @entity9 for the first time is another symptom of a very real change that is taking place in @entity31 politics			2

@entity47 chairman @entity79 said : ‘ the figures are jaw dropping			0
apparently it costs £ 1,000 an hour to hire your own very @entity44 leader			0
‘ @entity76 bosses like @entity73 have siphoned off £ 34 million from their members ' pay - packets , and funnelled it into @entity44 ’s election war chest - a truly staggering amount			0
‘ and we all know what payback they want from weak @entity68 : more wasteful spending , more taxes , and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay			0

shadow cabinet office minister @entity114 mp said : ‘ when millions are flowing in from hedge funds and exclusive groups of donors , is it any wonder @entity105 stands up for the privileged few ? ‘ millionaires and hedge funds have been given a tax cut while hardworking families suffer from a cost - of - living crisis			0
@entity105 is leading an out - of - touch , hollowed - out party which has no answers to the major challenges our country faces			0
’ mr @entity16 was a @entity47 donor who quit the party in 1994 over @entity131 ’s approach to @entity3 – before offering to fund rebel @entity43 in the 1997 election			2
