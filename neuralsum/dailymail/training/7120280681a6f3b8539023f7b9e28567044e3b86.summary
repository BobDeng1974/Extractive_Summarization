by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 3 april 2013 eye drops containing cholesterol - busting drugs could combat one of the most common causes of blindness eye drops containing cholesterol - busting drugs could combat one of the most common causes of blindness , according to new research			1
age - related macular degeneration ( @entity10 ) is a painless condition which leads to the gradual loss of the central vision			1
it is thought that aging , smoking and genetics can all increase a person ’s chance of developing the condition			0
however , it is also thought to be triggered by harmful blood fats			1
experiments on mice have found that deposits of this cholesterol contribute to the development of the condition			0
patients who have hardened arteries – which are also caused by harmful blood fats - often are prescribed medications to lower cholesterol and keep arteries clear			1
now , a study published in the journal @entity34 suggests that some of those same drugs could be used to treat patients with macular degeneration			1
professor @entity47 said : ‘ based on our findings , we need to investigate whether vision loss caused by macular degeneration could be prevented with cholesterol - lowering eye drops or other medications that might prevent the build - up of fats beneath the retina			1
’ an estimated 500,000 people in the @entity50 suffer from @entity10 , and 40 per cent are over the age of 75			2
the new research centres on immune cells known as macrophages that remove cholesterol and fats from tissues			0
in macular degeneration , the excessive build - up of cholesterol begins to occur as we age , and our macrophages begin to malfunction			1
in the less aggressive form of @entity10 , doctors examining the eye can see lipid deposits beneath the retina			2
as those deposits become larger and more numerous , they slowly begin to destroy the central part of the eye , interfering with the vision needed to read a book or drive a car			2
some of the drugs used to treat people with hardening of the arteries could be used to treat patients with macular degeneration professor @entity47 ’s researchers at the @entity80 found macrophages taken from old mice and patients with macular degeneration have inadequate levels of a protein called @entity87 which transports cholesterol out of cells			1
as a result , the old macrophages accumulated high levels of cholesterol and could not inhibit the growth of the damaging blood vessels that characterise the more advanced form of the disorder			0
@entity10 is a painless eye condition that leads to a gradual loss of the central vision			1
it 's the most common cause of visual impairment in the @entity50			0
it causes central vision to become blurred resulting in symptoms such as difficulty reading and problems recognising people 's faces			1
it usually affects both eyes but the speed of progression can vary between eyes			0
it occurs when the macular - the part of the eye responsible for central vision - stops functioning effectively			1
it is thought to be triggered by aging , smoking and genetics			0
does not affect the peripheral vision so does not cause complete blindness			0
there is currently no cure for the most common form of @entity10 - dry @entity10			2
but when the macrophages were treated with a substance that helped restore levels of @entity87 , the cells could remove cholesterol more effectively , and the development of new blood vessels was slowed			0
co-author , dr @entity131 , said : ‘ we were able to deliver the drug , called an @entity135 agonist , in eye drops			0
and we found we could reverse the macular degeneration in the eye of an old mouse			2
‘ that is exciting because if we could use eye drops to deliver drugs that fight macular degeneration , we could focus therapy only on the eyes , and we likely could limit the side effects of drugs taken orally			1
’ since macrophages are important in thickening of the arteries and in the formation of new blood vessels around certain types of cancerous tumours , the same pathway also might provide a target for more effective therapies for those diseases			2
professor @entity47 said : ‘ we have shown we can reverse the disease cascade in mice by improving macrophage function , either with eye drops or with systemic treatments			0
‘ some of the therapies already being used to treat thickening arteries target this same pathway , so we may be able to modify drugs that already are available and use them to deliver treatment to the eye			2
’ the @entity170 is currently running an awareness campaign about @entity10			0

drops could be used to treat age - related macular degeneration , which causes loss of central vision
occurs when blood fats build up behind the retina
theory now is that drugs used to treat hardened arteries - also caused by blood fats - could treat @entity10
