by @entity0 high demand : planning minister @entity2 warned 100,000 new homes will be built to accommodate the expanding @entity5 population vast swathes of the countryside will have to be sacrificed to build new homes for immigrants , the planning minister warned last night			1
@entity2 said migrants accounted for almost half of the housing demand , and his figures suggest 100,000 new homes a year will be needed to accommodate them			1
the minister added : ‘ we ca n’t go on like this			0
’ earlier this week , mr @entity2 alarmed conservationists by saying up to two million acres of green fields may have to be concreted over to deal with the housing shortage			2
now he has become the first government minister to draw a clear link between housing demand and the legacy of @entity25 ’s open - door immigration policy			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the fact is – and i am critical of the lastgovernment ’s immigration policies – we allowed the population of this country to expand dramatically			1
‘ the population of @entity34 has gone up by two million in the last ten years			0
these people now live here , these people are now @entity5 and they need homes just like other @entity5 people			1
‘ the fact is , 43 per cent of the new households which want a home , is accounted for by immigration			0
‘ we ca n’t go on like this			0
we need to have less immigration and more house - building and we might then have a civilised country			1
’ mr @entity2 warned the scale of demand meant large swathes of countryside would have to be sacrificed , because there were not enough empty homes or developed sites			1
deputy prime minister @entity55 said last month that the number of households was forecast to expand at the rate of 230,000 a year			2
the figure supplied by mr @entity2 suggests that immigration will account for almost 100,000 of the total			1
mr @entity55 said total house building amounted to just 117,000 last year , adding : ‘ there ’s only one way out of this housing crisis : we have to build our way out			1
’ sir @entity68 , founder of the think - tank @entity69 , said the public would be shocked by the figures , which are significantly higher than the government ’s previous estimate on the issue , which suggested immigration accounted for 36 per cent of new households			1
sir @entity68 said : ‘ at last a housing minister has been absolutely clear about the link between housing demand and immigration			2
the best way to deal with the housing crisis is to reduce immigration			0
’ at risk : with a lack of both empty homes and developed sites where new homes could be built , @entity88 land may have to be sacrificed mr @entity2 angered conservationists by suggesting the total area of land under development should be increased by a third to ease the housing shortage			1
he said ministers would protect the @entity88 , but warned that large areas of ‘ open land ’ may have to be given over for housing			0
and he hit out at developers for building ‘ pig ugly ’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development			0
road to recovery : deputy prime minister @entity55 suggest we build our way out of the housing crisis ‘ we ’re going to protect the @entity88 but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ in the @entity5 and @entity34 at the moment we ’ve got about 9 per cent of land developed			0
all we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land and we ’ll have solved a housing problem			0
’ @entity120 accused mr @entity2 of making up figures ‘ on the back of a fag packet ’ , while the @entity34 said his proposals were a licence to developers to ‘ let rip ’			2
the new row underlines the scale of the challenge posed to @entity5 ’s creaking infrastructure by the mass immigration policy presided over by @entity25			2
critics claim that schools , hospitals and the welfare system have also been placed under massive strain by the decision to lift restrictions on those coming to live and work in this country			0
the new figures will also place fresh pressure on ministers to deliver on @entity145 ’s pre-election pledge to slash net migration by more than half , to fewer than 100,000 a year			2
home secretary @entity148 has ordered officials to examine whether restrictions could even be placed on those coming here from other parts of the @entity153			0
figures out this week revealed that the government ’s immigration cap is having an effect , with officials recording the biggest fall in numbers for 20 years			0
the net migration figure – the number added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been counted – dropped by nearly 25 per cent from 242,000 to 183,000 .			0
