concern : @entity2 character @entity1 will commit suicide in monday 's episode campaigners have criticised plans to show a @entity2 character killing herself before the watershed , warning it could lead to copycat suicides among young viewers			1
the @entity15 soap sparked debate with the revelation that its much - loved character @entity1 will commit suicide in monday ’s episode rather than continue her losing battle with pancreatic cancer			1
she is played by @entity3 , a member of the @entity22 who has ‘ strong views ’ in favour of assisted dying			1
but the 43 - year - old – who has played the transsexual wife of café owner @entity29 for 15 years – has now been branded insensitive for discussing the plot in a series of recent interviews to highlight her belief that euthanasia should be legalised			2
miss @entity3 ’s final scenes in the soap – which air at 7.30pm – will show her drinking a cocktail of drugs before dying in bed in the arms of her husband			1
she mixes the lethal drink herself and tells him not to touch the glass , to avoid implicating him in her death			0
mr @entity47 disagrees with her decision and is left filled with feelings of guilt and anger			0
last night , anti-euthanasia group @entity52 said it was ‘ irresponsible ’ to schedule the storyline before the 9pm watershed when it would be seen by ‘ young and impressionable viewers ’			1
and @entity59 @entity58 director @entity57 said she feared the episode could lead to ‘ copycat ’ suicides			1
‘ putting it before a 9pm watershed , we can assume fairly safely that there are going to be children watching it , ’ she added			0
‘ they do not consume media in the same critical way adults do and are far more likely to take on as gospel truth what they ’ve seen			0
’ married couple : miss @entity3 's final scenes in the soap - which air at 7.30pm - will show her drinking a cocktail of drugs before dying in bed in the arms of her husband @entity47 , played by @entity85 the storyline has also reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a @entity89 hearing on the issue in may			1
@entity93 peer @entity92 , who has tabled an @entity94 , called for @entity95 to ‘ resolve the mess ’ of current legislation that makes it a crime to help the terminally ill to kill themselves			0
assisted suicide is legal in @entity101 , the @entity102 and some @entity104 states			2
since the @entity106 assisted dying centre opened in @entity101 in 1998 , more than 180 terminally ill @entity58 people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms			1
ex-soldier @entity110 , who had motor neurone disease , became the first @entity114 to publicly go to @entity106 and commit suicide in 2003			1
controversial : since the @entity106 assisted dying centre ( pictured ) opened in @entity101 in 1998 , more than 180 terminally ill @entity58 people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms his wife , @entity118 , was threatened with legal action when she got home but was not charged			1
yesterday , @entity59 @entity58 ’s @entity121 also attacked @entity122 for using her role in the storyline to generate publicity for views that she endorses			2
she said : ‘ she ’s perfectly entitled to her opinion as a public citizen			0
but to [ campaign ] on the back of this i think is not a good thing			0
i think it ’s very insensitive to do it on the back of this storyline			0
it ’s a very emotive issue and linking it to something like @entity2 which is much loved is not appropriate			0
’ @entity142 , from anti-euthanasia group @entity143 , said : ‘ we fear that monday ’s storyline will fail to give a medically - accurate depiction of the reality of palliative care in @entity58 today			2
’ but the plot was backed by the chief executive of pro-euthanasia group dignity in @entity152 , @entity153 , who said it had been approached in a ‘ sensitive way ’			0
she added : ‘ tv dramas , although fictional , often reflect very real issues			0
we know a small , but significant , number of terminally ill people want control over the manner and timing of their death			0
’ a @entity15 spokesman defended its decision to screen monday ’s episode before the watershed , saying : ‘ this storyline has been well signposted and viewers will be fully aware of the drama as it unfolds			1
’ he added : ‘ the @entity2 writing team independently arrived at the decision to conclude @entity1 ’s story in this way			2
this was in no way influenced by @entity3 or her personal beliefs			2

@entity1 will commit suicide in monday 's episode , airing at 7.30pm
played by @entity3 , who has ' strong views ' on assisted dying
campaigners warm it could lead to copycat suicides among young viewers
