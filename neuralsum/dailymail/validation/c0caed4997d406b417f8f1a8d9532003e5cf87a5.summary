@entity0 unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer - detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin			1
now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will ' automatically modify or destroy targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect '			1
according to the files , the wearable could target these cells using an ' external energy source ' such as ultrasound or radio frequencies			1
@entity0 's patent explained its wearable ( illustrated ) could target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels			1
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field ' a number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes [ chemicals ] in a person 's blood , ' explained the @entity40 patent			1
' @entity41 could ... be indicative of a medical condition or health of the person ' and could include ' enzymes , hormones , proteins , cells or other substances			2
' @entity0 continued that its wearable would target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels			1
in an interview with @entity58 , @entity56 ' president @entity55 recently said he thinks it 's possible to live to 500 years old			0
and this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics			0
he has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said : ' we have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision			1
i just hope to live long enough not to die			0
' mr @entity55 founded @entity56 in 2009 and oversees all of the fund ’s global activities			0
elsewhere he has develop @entity0 ’s @entity77 project			0
@entity78 is a research and development company set up in 2013 by @entity0 and @entity79 to tackle ' ageing and associated diseases			0
' @entity0 co-founder @entity82 said the project would focus on ' health , wellbeing and longevity ' and last @entity77 partnered with @entity87 to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer			2
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field			1
the energy used would depend on what the band is targeting , but it would be designed to alter the chemical composition of the analyte			0
' in one relevant example , certain proteins have been implicated as a partial cause of @entity104 ; the development of @entity104 may be prevented or retarded by providing particles functionalized with a bioreceptor that will selectively bind to this target ' continued the files			2
' these bound particles may then be used , in combination with a wearable device as described above , to modify or destroy the target protein			2
' as a further example , the target could be cancer cells ; by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells , the spread of cancer may be diminished			1
' in january , @entity120 , head of @entity121 unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells			2
after travelling around the body , these nanoparticles would then be collected , using a magnet , to reveal what cells they encountered			0
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body			1
the system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles , so scientists must understand how light passes through skin			2
so @entity0 started making skin			0
it would scan the blood for so - called analytes , or chemicals , in the blood such as the presence of ' enzymes , hormones , proteins , cells or other substances			1
' @entity0 said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of @entity104 , for example , or cancer cells in january , @entity0 's @entity121 lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells			1
to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors ( pictured ) to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors			1
as the wearable is still in the early stages of development , @entity174 is working to determine what defines a ' healthy ' person			2
they are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information			0
mr @entity120 admitted that people may find it ' weird ' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body			0
after travelling around the body , these nanoparticles would then be collected , using a magnet , to reveal what cells they encountered			0
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body ' it 's way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you , ' mr @entity120 continued			1
he said that the @entity174 team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive			0
' we 're making good progress but the journey is long and hard , he said			0
' so i think we will get there and i hope it 's years , not decades			0

patent *details* a wearable that could target substances in a wearer 's blood
this substances could be proteins linked with @entity104 's , or cancer cells
it would then ' modify or destroy ' targets by transmitting energy into blood
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse
scientists in the life sciences division of @entity174 laboratories are using human skin in their research to develop the wristband
wristband could also work with pills that cause *unhealthy* cells to light up
