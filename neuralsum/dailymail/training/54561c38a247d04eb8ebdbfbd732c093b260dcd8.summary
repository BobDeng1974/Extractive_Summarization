by @entity0 two teenage boys have been jailed for beating a man into a coma because they ' did n’t value his life '			1
@entity5 , 15 , and @entity6 , 17 , used a wooden chair leg to beat their victim before leaving him for dead			1
@entity9 , 54 , was sleeping in a shopping centre underpass in @entity11 , @entity12 , when the two boys launched their brutal attack - which left him close to death and blind in one eye			1
the attack mirrored a disturbing scene from cult movie @entity19 , which was banned for 27 years			1
thugs : @entity5 ( left ) and @entity6 were today sentenced for their part in a savage and premeditated attack on a sleeping homeless man , @entity24 horrific : @entity24 , pictured , was beaten into a coma by the two thugs , who also blinded him in one eye @entity5 and @entity6 tried to put the blame on each other for the vicious attack on may 8			1
but they were both found unanimously guilty of grievous bodily harm by a jury in november			0
@entity5 , a schoolboy at the time of the attack , was sent to a young offenders institute for seven - and - a - half years			1
@entity6 , who is now 18 , was sent to a young offenders institute for six years			1
@entity37 heard how mr @entity24 was discovered unconscious and ' soaked ' in his own blood			0
he was in a coma for a week , but miraculously survived despite suffering multiple fractures to his face and eye sockets			0
the two boys were spotted on @entity44 at the time of the attack and their tracksuit trousers and shoes were found to be spattered with blood			0
the court heard the pair , both from @entity11 , @entity12 , fled after the senseless attack and later met with up with friends			1
@entity53 : the baby - faced boys - @entity5 left and @entity6 right - attacked the vulnerable man while he slept in an underpass , the court heard prosecutor @entity59 said : ' it was a brutal and gratuitous attack by two young boys on a vulnerable homeless man			1
' with repeated use of a wooden chair leg they tried to kill him and left him for dead			1
they did n’t value his life			0
' @entity6 told one friend they had done something big			2
' @entity5 then said : “ i have killed someone - it was mental ”			1
he said he had attacked a man in the head with some wood and that after that he stopped making noises			2
' he said it was a crackhead asleep on the floor			0
they were boasting about what they had done			0
' judge @entity85 took the unusual step of naming and shaming @entity5 and @entity6 because of the ferocity of their late - night attack at @entity37 today			1
following an application from members of the press , mr @entity90 decided to lift the section 39 order on @entity5 - which had prevented the media from revealing his identity			1
although previously being granted anonymity during his trial , @entity6 turned 18 late last month - meaning reporting restrictions no longer applied to him			1
violent : the attack by the two teenage boys mirrored a scene in the 1971 film ' @entity19 ' , pictured despite mitigation from defence counsels , mr @entity90 said he regarded both youths as ' dangerous ' and would be ' imposing extended sentences '			1
sentencing , judge @entity85 told the two young boys : ' you treated your victim as beneath contempt - both show a worrying complete lack of human empathy			2
' you both know what you did that evening - although you are continuing to deny it			0
' the victim was completely helpless and could n’t have found himself in a more exposed position			0
' you both regarded him as easy game but the law treats everyone as being equally deserving of respect and dignity			0
' what happened is a wooden implement was picked up and the victim was savagely beaten around the head with it			2
in the 1971 film @entity19 a young gang beat a tramp senseless for singing drunkenly in an underpass			2
the film was later banned by its director @entity135 because there were fears it encouraged gratuitous copycat attacks			0
after being released from intensive care a week after the attack mr @entity24 said he wished he was dead and felt his life was ' finished '			2
' we can not be sure how many times he was struck but it was probably not the 40 times you , @entity5 , boasted to your friends			2
' the victim was left for dead , you thought he might be dead and he certainly might ’ve died			2
' blood from mr @entity24 was found on a shoe of the eldest boy , while eyewitnesses said they saw the youngest with blood on his face and tracksuit top sleeve afterwards			0
they tried to explain away those damning bits of evidence by saying they were only mere observers to what their friend had done and were too ' shocked ' and ' frightened ' to intervene			0
however , judge mr justice @entity85 said forensic evidence showed that the younger of the two boys - @entity5 - was the ringleader and had been the one who hit mr @entity24 over the head with a wooden table leg			1
he added : ' i am also satisfied that that this attack was not a spur of the moment ( decision )			0
' @entity6 , although your involvement was lesser , everything points to this being committed to this enterprise			2
. you lied to the jury on a truly epic scale			0
' the court ruled that both teenagers will only be eligible for parole after two - thirds of their detention had passed			0
and in order for them to be released on licence , the pair would have to prove they were no longer a danger to the public .			0
