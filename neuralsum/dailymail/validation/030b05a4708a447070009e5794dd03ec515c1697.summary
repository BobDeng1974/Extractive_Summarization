@entity0 became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the @entity3			1
the eight - year - old , trained by @entity5 and ridden by @entity6 , took the blue riband prize of steeplechasing on only his fourth race over fences			1
the success fully vindicated the decision to bypass the @entity12 earlier in the week and run in the @entity3 instead			1
@entity6 kisses the @entity13 following @entity0 's length and a half victory @entity16 and trainer @entity5 are all smiles with the 2015 trophy @entity16 and @entity0 clear a fence on their way to victory at the @entity13 @entity0 clears the last hurdle to set up a grandstand finish at the @entity25 showpiece @entity16 celebrates following his 2015 @entity3 triumph at @entity25 @entity0 became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the @entity29 @entity16 is overcome with emotion on his way to the parade ring following @entity34 's thrilling victory @entity16 is congratulated by the @entity25 faithful as he makes his way to the winner 's enclosure the 2015 @entity3 champion punches the air as he is led past the grandstand @entity34 trainer @entity5 is overjoyed following his horse 's @entity25 result @entity34 ( right ) did just enough to beat @entity45 and @entity46 in a thrilling finish @entity0 ( 7 - 1 ) held on up the hill by a length and a half from @entity51 ( 10 - 1 ) , with @entity46 ( 8 - 1 ) two lengths away in third			1
@entity53 said : ' it 's the best feeling ever , i 'm lost for words			1
' i never thought they should n't have run in this , it was a great plan			2
' the weather gods were looking down on us and the ground was ideal			2
@entity63 looks dejected after @entity64 finished ninth at the @entity13 ' he 's so deceptive , even when he gets in tight he 's brilliant , it 's all thanks to the @entity5 family , it 's a great family effort			1
' i must thank the owners and the @entity71 for keeping the faith in me			2
these horses only come once in a lifetime			0
' @entity75 , wife of the winning trainer and daughter of the @entity78 , who bred @entity0 , said : ' he ( @entity78 ) is not here , but he 's here in spirit			1
' i 'd been saying to people , when we win the @entity3 we 'll win the lottery , it 's that amazing			1
' ' it 's only his fourth run over fences , but he had so much time off and he 's wise in his own way			1
' @entity92 said : ' i 've been asking myself what decision would @entity93 ( @entity78 ) have made ? as it turned out , it was a very good decision after looking at @entity96 and @entity97 ( in the novice chases )			1
' to win this now - you dream and it 's absolutely amazing			1
' it was the 19 - times champion 's final ride in the @entity3 before his retirement mrs @entity75 added : ' all the people quoted stats at us , but this horse knows how to jump and how to gallop and he showed them			1
' we were forecast real rain , which made the decision for us , and it was an open @entity3			1
' it 's so unbelievable , i 've been in the yard from 6am until 10pm and it 's all for this			1
' all the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses and our mare cost Â£ 3,000			0
' people were asking after @entity124 ( when @entity125 rode in the @entity126 ) if @entity127 would get the ride back , but of course he would - he rides him beautifully , he 'll be a great jockey			0
' it 's a little bit back to work later as my favourite person , @entity132 , runs tomorrow ( at @entity133 ) , but i might not be at my best ! ' it shows anyone can do it , you do n't need millions ' he did n't know he 's a novice			1
' the winning trainer said : ' i 'm numb , it 's wonderful			1
it wo n't sink in for a while , but it 's great			1
@entity144 ( right ) was in attendance for the @entity146 ' we 've done it before in smaller races and we 'll still keep doing it , but it 's fantastic to do it on the big stage			1
' i ca n't remember where i watched it as i 'm not very good at watching races			0
' the decision was very tricky because the weather forecast was so up and down and obviously we were liaising very closely with @entity157 ( clerk of the course ) and walking the course			0
but we made the right decision			0
' he 's a gorgeous horse and it 's so tragic that @entity75 's dad ( @entity78 ) was n't here today to see it			2
' @entity166 , owner of the @entity168 - trained @entity167 , said : ' he 's run a stormer , i thought we had him but fair play to the winner , to run in this race as a novice and to do that from the front was spectacular			1
' he 'll be back next year			2
we 've had a great week			0
' his rider @entity176 said : ' he 's run a blinder			2
he made a few little jumping errors , but he 's run a blinder for a six - year - old			1
' he stuck his head out and gave me everything he had			0
' @entity168 said : ' we had a fantastic run and i was just commending the winner 's brave decision to run in the @entity3			1
it paid off and the winner did it the hard way in front			0
' i was delighted with my horse			0
he jumped great and got a good position			0
i do n't have any excuses and @entity176 does n't either			0
@entity176 ( centre ) had to contend with second place as @entity45 finished a length and a half behind @entity0 ' our fellow is only a six - year - old and the winner 's an eight - year - old			1
in those conditions , when stamina comes to the fore , age will always beat youth			0
we 'll go on to @entity211			0
' @entity212 said of @entity213 : ' he ran a great race			2
we 're delighted and disappointed			0
what other way can you be ? ' we thought we had a chance at the last			0
it 's possible the ground was a disadvantage to us			2
maybe it was n't , but we think it might have been			0
' @entity223 , rider of fourth home @entity224 , said : ' he stays all day and you ca n't ask any more			0
he gave me his all today			0
' his trainer @entity229 said : ' we 're delighted with our little horse			2
it was a brilliant race really			2
' we had to put a lot of effort in with his jumping			0
he 'd be better on better ground , but today the best horse won			0
' our horse ran a blinder and we 're thrilled to bits with him			0
' the winner is a fantastic horse and they could n't catch him			0
' @entity248 , trainer of the vanquished favourite @entity249 , who was seventh , said : ' @entity212 ( @entity250 ) is not really sure			1
my view is that the ground might have been deep enough for him			0
it was a bit more testing than we thought			0
' watching that i suppose he is better on a flatter track on better ground			0
if he 's fresh and well we 'll probably head to @entity262 with him now			2
' @entity63 was ninth on @entity64 in what was his final ride in the @entity3 before retirement			1
the 19 - times champion said : ' i knew when we got here this morning we were in trouble			2
he 's a horse that likes good ground and for a horse that 's slow but has a bit of speed at the end of his race , he does n't like it when it turns into a drag			1
' paying tribute to the winner , @entity63 said : ' fair do 's to the @entity71 for running him			1
it was an unbelievable performance from a novice chaser			2
' he got them at it early and stuck at it well			0
