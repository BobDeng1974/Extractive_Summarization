dubbed by experts as @entity1 , today is officially the most depressing day of the year			2
post-christmas debt , bad weather and failing @entity6 's resolutions are all factors in making this innocent monday in january , the worst in the calendar			1
but if you do n't want to be sucked into the sadness , here are some instant happiness tricks that psychologists and scientists say will lift your spirits			1
breathing , laughing , eating and exercising can all boost happiness levels plug in your headphones scientists at the @entity20 recently found that people can boost their mood by simply listening to upbeat music			1
in the study , participants improved their mood after being told to try to do so , but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of @entity27 , as opposed to the sadder tunes of @entity29			2
if @entity29 is n't your thing , an online survey my metrolyrics.com found @entity34 ! 's @entity35 ' was considered the happiest song of all time			1
and , with lyrics including , ' you take the grey skies out of my way			2
you make the sun shine brighter than @entity42 ' we have to agree			2
get sweaty for 20 minutes people often use the terms ' endorphin rush ' or ' runner 's high ' to explain the mood lift elicited by exercise			1
but rather than a sudden burst of euphoria , research has found a mere 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise can produce more subtle mood benefits that last as long as 12 hours			1
that 's according to @entity56 , @entity57 , author of @entity58 : the @entity59 , who puts this happiness effect down to a substances called @entity63			1
@entity63 rises during exercise , prompting neural growth and repairing damage caused by ongoing stress and depression			1
' @entity63 is like @entity69 for your brain , ' explains dr @entity56			2
stress out the body and help de-stresses the mind			0
you can boost your mood simply by listening to upbeat music eat something fishy eating oily , fatty fish ( salmon , tuna , sardines , rainbow trout ) and mussels will give you omega - 3s - a key mood - boosting nutrient and one our bodies do n't produce naturally			1
omega - 3s alter brain chemicals linked with mood - specifically dopamine and serotonin			0
low levels of serotonin are linked with depression and aggression , while dopamine is a happy chemical that the brain releases in response to pleasurable experiences			0
you may not find eating oily fish pleasurable , but your brain will			0
@entity103 , like this ... breathe in through the nose , hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out			1
' five of those breaths will even out your neurochemistry and make you feel good , ' explains @entity110 , clinical psychologist and author of mindfulness bible ' @entity112 to calm '			0
' when you breathe through the nose rather than the mouth you automatically take in the right amount of oxygen , because it restricts the amount of air you inhale			1
breathe in through the nose , hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out for an instant ' feel good ' boost ' when you take in too much air , you increase oxygen too much and become hyper alert , which is n't " feel good " , ' she says			1
' holding the breath gives us the message to ourselves that we 're in control and breathing out through the mouth gets rid of excess gases in the body			0
' ideally we want a balance of gases so we feel an equilibrium			0
' we should in fact be breathing like this at all times , says @entity110 , but five concentrated breaths is enough to give us an instant boost			1
have a ( fake ) laugh when we laugh , our body relaxes and feel - good endorphins are released into the blood stream			1
nothing to chuckle about on @entity1 ? luckily the body ca n't distinguish between real and fake laughter			0
so faking it has the same beneficial effect			0
it was dr @entity152 , a psychiatrist at @entity153 who first began to examine the physiological effects of laughter in the late 1960s and is considered the father of ' gelotology ' ( the science of laughter )			0
he found that laughter , real or fake , provides good physical exercise and increases the body 's production of endorphins			1
dr @entity165 set up the first laughter club in @entity167 in 1995 and there are now more than 5,000 laughter clubs worldwide			0
but there 's no need for any expert tuition			1
fake a laugh and the endorphins will come rushing			1
sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities now find someone to smile at faking a smile or laughter gives you a small boost but smiling warmly at a stranger and eliciting a smile back makes you feel connected and safe			0
' the best way to for us to feel good is to feels safe - and the only way we feel safe is to feel connected , ' says @entity110			0
' we have boosts of cortisol when we 're feeling down , ' says @entity110			0
' when you feel safe again the cortisol levels down			0
' she adds : ' getting a warm response back from a stranger is so powerful			0
' end the day on a high it might be too late to start the day in a good mood , but there 's one way to guarantee it finishes on a high			2
when both men and women orgasm , oxytocin is released , which is the brain chemical that makes us experience feelings of happiness			2
oxytocin has also been found to calm fears and anxiety and increase trust and contentment			2
positive interaction with friends and family increases the chemical somewhat too , as does any sexual activity			0
but sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities .			0

debt , weather and failing @entity6 's resolutions all contributing factors
