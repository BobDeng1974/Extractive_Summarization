he somehow lost track of the puck and it dropped to the ice and rolled between his legs			0
the junior player attempted to pick it up , but somehow skated back and kicked it into his own net			0
@entity28 's own - goal turned his team 's 3 - 2 lead into a 3 - 3 tie			1
a few minutes later , @entity36 scored with 6:17 remaining to give the @entity13 the lead and the eventual win			1
it was the school 's first @entity16 hockey title and third straight year a first - time champion has won it all			1

i thought it rolled out of it			0
i tried to drop and throw it to @entity69 and it was too late			0
' everyone in this locker room deserves a lot better			0
' they deserve to be hoisting the national championship right now			1
' @entity9 players skated slowly over to @entity28 to console him after the loss			2
