by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 03:57 est , 29 july 2013 immigration figures are ‘ little better than a best guess ’ which could downplay the numbers coming in by 35,000 every year			2
in a blistering report , mps said the statistics – based on interviews with the equivalent of 13 immigrants a day – were ‘ not fit for purpose ’			2
they were told that @entity11 has a better way of recording visitors than the @entity14			2
the level of net migration , even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent , could be 35,000 higher or lower , a committee warned the revelations have put ministers under pressure to crack down harder if they are to hit their target of reducing net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			1
currently , cutting net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving in the @entity14 , and those leaving – to anything below 100,000 would be considered a success			1
but the government ’s own panel of experts , the @entity36 , said ministers must aim for a total of 50,000			2
this was the ‘ only way of being certain ’ the key @entity42 election pledge had been achieved , the experts said			2
in the year to june 2012 , immigration was estimated at 515,000 , while emigration was estimated at 352,000 , putting net migration at 163,000			1

mps were told that theme park has a better way of recording visitors than the @entity14 but @entity53 ’s @entity52 said the figures produced by the @entity55 and the @entity56 were ‘ blunt instruments ’ and ‘ not adequate ’			1
they are based on the @entity59 , which interviews a tiny number of the 100million people arriving in the @entity14 every year			0
@entity63 said just 5,000 migrants a year were identified through the survey and it had a ‘ large margin of error ’			0
the level of net migration , even if the margin of error was only 5 per cent , could be 35,000 higher or lower , the committee warned			1
chairman @entity74 said : ‘ most people would be utterly astonished to learn that there is no attempt to count people as they enter or leave the @entity14			0
as an island nation , with professional statisticians and effective border controls , we could gain decent estimates of who exactly is coming into this country , where they come from , and why they are coming here			0
‘ as it is , the top - line numbers for the government ’s 100,000 net migration target are little better than a best guess – and could be out by tens of thousands			1
’ @entity93 , leader of @entity94 , said : ‘ when i gave evidence to this committee , i said @entity11 has better technology to keep track of its visitors than we do			0
’ the report , which compared the @entity14 's tracking system with @entity11 's , said just 5,000 migrants a year were identified through the survey and it had a ' large margin of error ' but @entity107 @entity106 said : ‘ we are not a totalitarian state			0
we do n’t count every single person			0
the idea there ’s some vast , hidden army of people , is almost certainly completely wrong			0
’ sir @entity115 , chairman of the @entity117 campaign group , said : ‘ better statistics would , of course , be helpful			0
but blunt instruments have their uses			1
‘ the immigration target has been vital in turning around immigration policy which has already resulted in a reduction of approximately 100,000 in net migration			1
‘ the exact figure may not be precise but there is no doubt that this is a major achievement			0
’ a @entity56 spokesman said : ‘ we disagree with the report ’s conclusions			1
@entity90 reforms on immigration are working and the statistics do show that net migration is at its lowest level for a decade			1
‘ the government is determined to build a fairer system and to address the public ’s concern about immigration			0
‘ we are committed to getting net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands , and we want to be judged against the very best available evidence			1

cutting net migration to anything below 100,000 would be a success
figures produced by the @entity55 and the @entity56 were ' blunt instruments '
