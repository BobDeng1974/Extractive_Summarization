@entity5 said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ‘ staggering ’ and required tougher intervention than just encouraging healthy eating			1

changes : taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity , a leading scientist has suggested the peer said soft policy ‘ nudges ’ would not solve the obesity crisis alone , and called for tougher restrictions on food marketing and advertising			1
he praised a recent move in @entity34 to only sell cigarettes in plain packaging and proposals to sell them only under the counter , saying smoking and obesity required tough regulation			0
‘ in the case of obesity [ we need ] more regulation of the food industry to prevent them in their quest , in which they are immensely successful , of distilling fat , salt and sugar into perfect little gems we are all happy to eat ’ , he told the @entity13 in @entity42			0
‘ they are very good at promoting it particularly to children			1
when i was shopping at @entity59 in the centre of @entity61 i was completely struck by , at this level above the ground , all the little kiddies ’ sweeties lined up there			2
rise : @entity5 said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ' staggering ' ‘ it ’s clearly totally inappropriate for businesses to be able to do that			1
it ’s directly marketing to three year old kids things that they should n’t be encouraged to eat large quantities of			0
’ in a speech today he will say there is ‘ no magic bullet ’ for tackling obesity , but scientists were generally agreed that while exercise is important , reducing calorie intake is the best way to lose weight			0
low level intervention such as information about healthy eating ; and what he called middle - rung measures including publishing salt and fat content on packets would not be enough , he said			1
one @entity95 initiative known as the @entity96 involved encouraging people to buy healthier products such as fruit and vegetables with supermarket discount vouchers			2
however he said there was evidence that families simply used the money they saved to buy more unhealthy food			0
he said : ‘ the @entity96 is part of the government 's wider initiative of inviting the food industry to help to tackle obesity on a voluntary basis			2
‘ the problem with this , as a food industry director said to the @entity117 , ' any business is in business to make money and opportunities to influence behaviour will be taken if they are a means to selling more products '			0
’ the government has set up a @entity126 - also known as the ‘ @entity126 ’ - to find ways of discreetly altering human behaviour by persuasion such as paying fines on time			2
but @entity5 that this kind of policy was not strong enough to address major problems such as obesity or unsustainable consumption which required ‘ a shove rather than a nudge ’			1
during his chairmanship of the @entity15 , @entity5 criticised the organic food movement , saying that people buying such food were ' not getting value for money			1
’ yesterday he said the rate of overweight and obese children had doubled in two decades , with major implications for health which would put a huge burden on the healthcare system			0
he said : ‘ it is easy to describe the cause of obesity			0
we live in an environment in which delicious , affordable calories are more readily available and in which our lifestyles have become more sedentary than ever before in our evolutionary history , and our body ’s inbuilt regulatory mechanisms are simply not equipped to cope			0
‘ it is much less easy to see how whole populations , not just in this country , but all over the globe , can be persuaded to change their behavior by eating less and / or exercising more … the central challenge is to find ways of getting populations as a whole to change their behaviour			0
