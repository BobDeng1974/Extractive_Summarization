by @entity1 reporter published : 09:32 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 2 december 2013 the men of the @entity3 had their beards shaped live on air this morning to mark the end of their month - long charity challenge - but none of them had them fully shaved off			1
the hosts of the morning talk show program took part in the national ' no shave november ' campaign where men across @entity15 tossed out their razors for the month in an effort to raise money for various charities that support men 's health			1
' we did n't just do this to look terrible , we did this to raise money , ' @entity21 said monday 's show			1
@entity21 did n't really think he looked terrible , however , as he announced that he would be keeping it for the winter			2
watch the video here the big reveal : viewers suggested which looks the anchors should try out , and while a couple of them were game , @entity21 decided that he wanted to keep his beard spot the difference : @entity21 decided that he just wanted the barber to give him a close trim and not actually shave the beard ( before at left and after at right ) to mark the end of november , razor producer @entity41 arranged for four top barbers to come in to shave the hosts and viewers were able to weigh in on styling options - choosing between a goatee , mustache , mutton chops or a chin curtain			1
@entity52 said that he would try out the goatee that was suggested for him , but @entity21 announced he would be disregarding the same suggestion completely and opting to just have the barbers trim the beard and allow him to keep it for the winter			1
' my dad wore a goatee in the last few years of his life and he always looked good , ' @entity52 said			0
@entity63 , who had the most trouble growing a full - fledged beard , initially said he would sport the suggested mustache for a few hours before shaving it off completely			2
that cut off may come quicker as he did not take to the mustache - and knew that his wife would not either			0
' i can not go home with this , ' he said			0
' i 'm going to transition into a different form of media , the adult form , ' saying how he thought he looked like a porn star			0
he 's not a fan : @entity63 ( before at left and after at right ) said that he looked like he was a part of the ' adult entertainment ' industry and immediately knew that he would have to shave it off before going home to his wife @entity82 , who was joining remotely from @entity83 , said he would do the same for the suggested goatee			1
@entity82 clearly had the fullest beard of the bunch , as @entity21 joked earlier that it took him only seven hours to grow it completely			2
not everyone loved the beards as internet commentors took the anchors to task during the @entity95 parades , saying that @entity21 and @entity52 looked like they were homeless hobos			1
‘ somebody do something ! a homeless man got hold of a microphone and is covering the parade ! oh no. wait			0
oh , ’ wrote @ brettfaultless			0
while no - shave november , or @entity106 , initially began as a way to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer , but the @entity3 embraced a larger concept for the challenge with each of the hosts picking a different charity to support			2
embracing it : @entity52 said that his kids likened him to ' @entity118 ' with the full beard ( left ) but decided to stick with the goatee ( right ) like his father had for a few years before his death @entity21 stuck with the @entity123 , @entity52 chose the @entity124 , @entity63 chose the @entity125 and @entity126 and @entity82 chose the @entity127 as his mother has survived the disease that also targets men			1
@entity41 donated $ 100,000 to the cause , splitting it among the four charities			0
while @entity21 did n't actually shave off the beard monday morning , he did take part in the on - air prostate screenings that were held one week into the challenge			2
he and @entity52 went to @entity138 in @entity139 , where dr. @entity140 , a urologist , carried out a rectal exam on each of the men in an examination room off - screen			0
natural : @entity82 , who was in his @entity83 radio station at the time , said he had no trouble growing a full beard @entity149 : @entity82 joked around with his new look but said that his ' dream is to play for the @entity152 ' so he would have to shave to be a member of clean - shaven team the @entity3 has a history of giving out on - air exams , starting with former anchor @entity157 who underwent a colonoscopy live on the show in 2000 following her husband 's death from colon cancer two years earlier			1
while @entity157 and both of the male co-hosts were given clean bills of health , one of their counterparts over at @entity168 discovered she has breast cancer after having an on - air mammogram			0
@entity171 is now undergoing treatment for the disease and is scheduled to return to work at @entity175 today .			0

the morning show anchors did not shave for the month of november

@entity52 and @entity82 went with goatees and @entity63 got a mustache , but @entity52 was the only one to like his look
