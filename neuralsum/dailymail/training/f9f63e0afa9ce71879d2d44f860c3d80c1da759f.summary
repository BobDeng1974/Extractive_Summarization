by @entity1 reporter published : 15:17 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 15:20 est , 20 september 2012 an innocent couple were accused of battering their month - old baby who was taken away and put up for adoption after the baby milk they fed him caused rickets			2
social workers , experts and even a judge had assumed the child had been the victim of horrific abuse after he was found to have suffered broken bones			1
after hearing expert evidence in june last year , a judge at @entity16 ruled that one or other of the parents must have been responsible for the injuries			0
@entity21 's @entity20 heard there is evidence that the boy was born with a @entity26 deficiency , inherited from his mother , and that this led to ' soft bones ' and rickets the same judge refused to change her mind earlier this year and freed the boy for adoption			1
now , however , the parents have been given a final chance to get him back after lawyers had a ' light bulb moment ' and understood the full significance of the youngster ’s medical records			0
@entity45 , for the family , from the @entity43 area , told @entity21 ’s @entity20 that there is evidence that the boy was born with a @entity26 deficiency , inherited from his mother , and that this led to ' soft bones ' and rickets			1
although blood tests carried out when he was four weeks old were normal , the barrister said his congenital condition would by then have been ' masked ' by the formula milk given to him by his mother - which contained @entity26 supplements			1
mr @entity45 argued that rickets was the true explanation for multiple broken bones suffered by the baby boy which could have been caused during his difficult forceps birth , or even in - utero			1
he pointed to ' striking ' medical records which showed severe abnormalities in the functioning of the baby boy ’s liver , an organ instrumental in processing @entity26 now @entity69 has intervened in the case , directing that the evidence be reviewed by a fresh medical expert			2
mr @entity45 said that one of the country ’s top endocrinologists , professor @entity76 , who has carried out pioneering work on the causes and effects of @entity26 deficiency , will be instructed to carry out that task if he is available at short notice			1
observing that medical knowledge on the causes of infant injuries is in a state of contant movement , the barrister added : ' this is an important case			0
it is starting to take on the appearance of a leading test case '			0
however , @entity69 observed : ' medical knowledge of how some children may have bones that are more susceptible to injury than normal children has moved on '			0
he added that there was no evidence of emotional difficulties , domestic violence , alcohol or drug abuse , or any signs of dysfunction within the family , to indicate a risk of child abuse			2
emphasising the extreme urgency of the case in light of plans for the boy ’s imminent adoption , the judge gave the parents 28 days to obtain a report from professor @entity76 , or another expert , in support of their case			0
recognising the parents ’ ' exceptionally awful ' experience in having their child taken from them , he said the court would carefully examine whether the @entity26 deficiency explanation for the boy ’s injuries was ' more than an intellectual possibility '			1
the local authority involved in the case had informed the @entity20 that suitable adoptive parents have already been found for the boy but no further steps in the process would be taken prior to the court ruling on the case			0
the case will return to the @entity20 once the expert medical report has been obtained .			0

social workers , experts and a judge had assumed the child had been the victim of horrific abuse
but his broken bones were really caused by an inherited @entity26 deficiency
