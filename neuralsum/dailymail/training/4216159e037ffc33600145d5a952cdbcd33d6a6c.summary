by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:51 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 19 july 2013 like millions of schoolchildren , @entity3 could n’t wait to start their six week summer holiday			1
but without the chance to watch a dvd or play @entity9 on the green benches of the @entity11 hardly any politicians bothered turning up for the last day of the parliamentary term			1
maybe @entity3 can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the @entity15 had a recess			1
early finish : at 4.19pm yesterday afternoon the green benches of the @entity11 were almost empty as mps dashed off for their summer recess at 5.20pm yesterday commons @entity20 moved to adjourn the @entity11 until september 2			1
it means there will be no new legislation , no debates and no prime minister ’s questions for six long weeks			1
@entity3 argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies			2
with the general election now less than two years away , those with the smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more voters			2
however the chance to get away early proved too great for most			0
@entity33 lead the way after being spotted in the crowds watching the cricket at @entity37			1
10.02am : on the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen @entity3 turned up in the @entity15 to grill business secretary @entity39 1.37pm : by lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches 5pm : with most people still hard at work in the country , just three mps could be seen in the @entity15 chamber before it packed up for the summer the prime minister donned sunglasses to make sure he did not miss any of the action during the second @entity51 test			1
the visit to the cricket is just the start of a long summer for mr @entity33 , who has previously been accused of spending too long chillaxing			1
he is expected to return to @entity56 for a holiday this summer , while reports also suggest he will take a break in @entity60 – in the middle of his campaign against independence			1
mr @entity64 will be away at the same time , leaving @entity65 and @entity66 in charge of the country			1
the @entity47 and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in charge of the country			1
chilling : @entity33 was in the stands at @entity37 for the second @entity51 test as mps began their six - week where 's @entity78 ? the prime minister was surrounded by ordinary fans as he watched @entity81 all out for 361 as the @entity15 wound down yesterday it seemed most mps have started their break early			1
fewer than 50 of the 650 mps turned out to see business secretary @entity39 answer questions on the economy at 9.30am			0
by 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an @entity93 - @entity92			0
as the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of @entity3 left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures			0
and just three were left when @entity99 mp @entity98 had a debate on @entity101			0
in 2012 - 13 the @entity15 sat just 145 times , the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election			0
some in @entity107 predict it could be even lower this year			0
@entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 ’ @entity108 , said : ‘ any mp worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess			1
‘ however , the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in @entity118 for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account			0
‘ week in , week out , we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions , which means @entity125 are getting passed by mps without having been subject to detailed scrutiny			2
‘ this is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the @entity15 to properly debate new laws and hold the government to account			2
’ clash : mr @entity33 will be on holiday at the same time as his deputy @entity64 this summer , leaving @entity65 and @entity66 in charge since january , mps have only had a full five - day week in @entity107 eight times			1
they usually spend monday to thursday in @entity118 and then have friday as a ‘ constituency day ’ to attend local events and meet voters			2
the @entity15 had a week off in february for half term			0
it then broke up for 19 days , returning once when @entity118 was recalled for tributes to @entity145			0
the @entity15 then sat for just eight days before breaking again on april 25 , this time for prorogation to prepare for the @entity147 on may 8			2
it meant a bonus 12 days off , before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the @entity151			0
despite setting out more than a dozen major bills , including legislation on reforming social care and pensions , there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws			0
they then broke up for a week - long recess at the end of may and had another week off at the end of june			2
earlier this year @entity163 , the @entity164 mp who chairs @entity107 ’s spending watchdog , warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money			0
' we are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times			0
@entity3 have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess , ’ she said			1
' members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is mps who are lazy and that it is @entity118 that is failing to provide good value for money			0
' we are not spending enough time in @entity107 , and this creates a democratic vacuum			0

@entity11 almost empty for last debates before summer recess
@entity33 spends the day watching the ashes at @entity37
prime minister and @entity64 *due* to be on holiday at the same time
