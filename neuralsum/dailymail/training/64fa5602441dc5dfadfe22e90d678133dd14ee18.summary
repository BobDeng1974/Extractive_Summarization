by @entity1 reporter children should not drink rice milk because it can contain harmful levels of arsenic , scientists have warned			1
the poison is found naturally in low levels in rice and other plants			2
levels can be boosted by the way rice is grown in flooded paddies and by the presence of traces of old pesticides			1
parents have been warned not to feed their children rice milk because it can contain harmful levels of arsenic ( file picture ) rice bran , from which rice milk is made , carries higher levels than raw polished white rice			1
the @entity28 already advises parents not to feed rice milk – often used by those who are lactose - intolerant – to under - fives			1
now the @entity33 for @entity34 ( @entity35 ) has extended this to older children			0
its report calls for arsenic levels to be regulated in products used by children			1
currently arsenic content of foods is not regulated			0
no ‘ safe ’ level of exposure can be identified			0
the @entity28 already advises parents not to feed rice milk ( pictured ) ¿ often used by those who are lactose - intolerant ¿ to under - fives the report says : ‘ the risk from consumption of products made from rice bran , such as rice drinks , is much higher than from raw – but polished – white rice			1
’ as well as being a poison , arsenic is linked to the development of some forms of cancer			2
dr @entity63 , of @entity64 in @entity65 , who led the commentary , said : ' inorganic arsenic is considered a first level carcinogen and its long - term exposure has negative effects on human health			2
' because of its availability , nutritional value and relatively low allergenic potential , rice is a widely used carbohydrate during weaning			0
@entity78 and rice products such as starch , flour and syrup are commonly added to infant foods and drinks			0
the report said : ' that contributes to high exposure of infants and young children to inorganic arsenic which is two to three times higher than in adults			0
' @entity35 says rice - based formulas ' are an option ' for infants allergic to cow 's milk but their arsenic content should be declared and considered by doctors and parents			1
otherwise the organisation recommends avoiding rice drinks for infants and young children and including a variety of other grains in their diets such as oats , barley , wheat and corn			0
it also calls for further research on the inorganic arsenic content of rice and other foods and its lifelong impact on health .			0
