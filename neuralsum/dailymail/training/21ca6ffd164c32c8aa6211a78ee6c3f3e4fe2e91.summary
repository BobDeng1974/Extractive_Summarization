by @entity0 , science reporter @entity4 may well have existed , and still be on the red planet - but not in any recognisable form , @entity3 scientists said today			0
scientists believe the discovery of minerals below the @entity11 's surface is the ' strongest evidence yet ' it may have supported life			1
but far from hosting little green men , our celestial neighbour was likely inhabited by simple microorganisms			0
the huge @entity18 created by a meteorite which smashed into the surface of @entity11 , has been shown to reveal signs of life layers with @entity24 on @entity11 this view of layered rocks on the floor of @entity18 shows sedimentary rocks that contain spectroscopic evidence for minerals formed through interaction with water scientists at the @entity34 looked at data from @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity39 's @entity38 spacecrafts and analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make - up has been altered by water lifeless : this image provided by @entity37 shows the late - afternoon shadow cast by the @entity11 rover opportunity a new study led by the @entity51 , with the @entity34 , found that all the ingredients for life were present just below the planet 's surface for much of its history			1
when meteorites strike the surface of @entity11 , they act like natural probes , bringing up rocks from far beneath the crust			0
looking at data from @entity37 's @entity36 and @entity39 's @entity38 spacecrafts , they analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make - up has been altered by water			1
with up to half of life on @entity72 consisting of simple microorganisms that live in below the surface , scientists have suggested that the same may have been true for @entity11			1
prof @entity75 , 55 , a geochemist at the @entity34 was one of the experts who have uncovered evidence of life on @entity11 dr @entity80 , lead author and planetary geologist at the @entity51 said : ' all the ingredients were there for life , but only small single - cell organisms could have survived in those conditions			1
' but i would now be more surprised if there was never any life on @entity11 , than i would be if we did one day discover that simple life lived in that environment			2
' and if life existed then , there is a chance it could still exist now			0
' some deep craters on @entity11 also acted as basins where groundwater likely emerged to produce lakes , which contain clay and carbonate minerals			2
the fluids that formed these minerals could one day tell us more as to whether there was life beneath the surface , and also carry clues to how life developed on @entity72			1
dr @entity80 , whose study is published in the journal @entity113 , said : ' we do n't know how life on @entity72 formed but it is conceivable that it originated underground , protected from harsh surface conditions that existed on early @entity72			2
' due to plate tectonics , however , the early geological record of @entity72 is poorly preserved so we may never know what processes led to life 's origin and early evolution			0
' exploring these rocks on @entity11 , where the ancient geologic record is better preserved than on @entity72 , would be like finding a stack of pages that have been ripped out of @entity72 's geological history book			1
' whether the @entity11 geologic record contains life or not , analysis of these types of rocks would certainly teach us a tremendous amount about early chemical processes in the solar system			0
' @entity37 's @entity11 probe , the @entity139 , will begin drilling on the planet 's surface in the next few days [ check it has n't started ] for rock samples			0
it is the most highly anticipated milestone since the six - wheel , nuclear - powered rover landed near the @entity11 equator five months ago .			0

@entity11 could have hosted microorganisms
@entity18 holds traces of water altered minerals
findings could reveal clues about life on @entity72
