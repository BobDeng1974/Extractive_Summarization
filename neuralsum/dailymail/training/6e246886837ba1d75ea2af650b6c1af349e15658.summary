a desperate man was told by a 999 call handler that it was n’t possible to ‘ magic an ambulance ’ as he watched his fiancee dying in front of him			1
@entity7 , 53 , pleaded with emergency services over three separate calls – all the while @entity10 was crying out as she coughed up blood			1
despite 57 - year - old miss @entity10 ’s condition deteriorating rapidly , mr @entity7 was also told : ‘ we do n’t have ambulances waiting on street corners			1
' anger : @entity7 is suing the @entity18 after a 999 call handler told him the service could n't ' magic an ambulance '			1
he was calling in a distressed state as his partner @entity10 ( right ) lay dying and a call handler wrongly deemed the family home to be a threatening environment because they could hear miss @entity10 ’s two distressed sons who have learning difficulties			1
three ambulances were redirected from attending the family home , and when a fourth finally turned up after 40 minutes , it was too late to save her			2
her family later found out that she had unknowingly been suffering from cervical cancer			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ the way we were treated was just diabolical			2
it was like we were just a number , not human beings			0
‘ because of what happened we did n’t even get the chance to say goodbye to her			0
’ he has now launched a clinical negligence case against the @entity48			1
mr @entity7 said he was left in disbelief as the tragedy unfolded in june when the operator said that an ambulance could not be sent because raised voices could be heard in the house			2
it was in fact the sound of miss @entity10 ’s two sons , @entity58 , 34 , and @entity59 , 32 , who were shouting due to their inability to summon any help			2
death : ms @entity10 was in her home in @entity64 when she was struck with severe pain at one stage an ambulance was only five minutes from the house in @entity64 , @entity69 , but a call handler told mr @entity7 that she ‘ could n’t magic [ it ] to come straight away ’			1
an investigation found that the first ambulance dispatched to the scene had been stood down , while another was rerouted to a higher priority case			0
a third was redirected for refuelling , with a @entity79 eventually arriving at the family home			0
an investigation by the trust found that the call handler wrongly deciphered the frustration at the scene as aggression and also failed to confirm miss @entity10 ’s level of consciousness			1
interim chief executive @entity89 wrote in the report that the call handler ' responded inappropriately ' and ' showed a lack of empathy ' to the family			1
he added : ' the patient was clearly critically ill and they displayed this fear by shouting and swearing			0
the patient 's son was calmed when advised that an ambulance was travelling			0
' the call handler made a decision to categorise the call as unsuitable for a rapid response paramedic , believing the scene to be potentially unsafe for a lone worker			1
' this resulted in the rapid response paramedic being instructed to leave the scene shortly after arrival			0
' the report added the 999 call handler also failed to confirm whether ms @entity10 was conscious , even after being given information which suggested she could have passed out			1
' the call handler failed to confirm what the main concern was and chose to triage the abdominal pain regardless , ' the report said			1
@entity119 - based @entity118 are now representing mr @entity7 in a claim against the @entity18			1
mr @entity89 wrote : ' it was agreed that the call handler failed to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and had not carried out their duties to the standards required			1
' as a result the call handler has been referred to be dealt with under the @entity130 with the aim to improve the level of service provided			2
' he added procedures had been ' reinforced ' throughout the department and the investigation had been shared with the @entity138			0
@entity69 coroner @entity139 has cancelled an inquest because ms @entity10 's death was due to natural causes			1
in a statement , @entity143 , chief executive of @entity48 , said : ‘ @entity145 identified concerns with the quality of the 999 call and launched an internal investigation			0
‘ a number of errors were identified and for that the @entity152 would like to again apologise unreservedly to the family , as well as offering reassurances that lessons have been learnt			0
’ but mr @entity7 , who had planned to marry his partner last month , said : ‘ you would expect somebody doing that kind of job to be experienced and to their job properly			2
9.38am - first 999 call vehicle 1 ( a rapid response car ) and @entity165 assigned 9.44am vehicle 1 reaches the scene but is stood down because situation is ' potentially unsafe ' 9.45am vehicle 2 stood down and sent to another incident in @entity171 9.49am vehicle 3 ( also a rapid response car ) assigned but is stood down 13 seconds later 9.53am - second 999 call 9.55am vehicle 3 assigned again but is stood down two minutes later 10.02am vehicle 4 assigned 10.13am - third 999 call 10.17am vehicle 4 reaches the scene and @entity178 is assigned a minute later 10.23am vehicle 5 stood down because it needs refuelling 11.08am police logs confirm ms @entity10 has died ‘ apparently one of the women has been retrained but that does n’t help me			1
‘ and i worry that this could happen to somebody else too if it is n’t addressed			0
‘ it was awful to see me and my boys watching their mother , and my partner , dying in front of us			0
’ @entity64 's @entity195 mp @entity194 revealed she has had several complaints about the same ambulance service			2
she told @entity198 : ' we 've had many complaints about the @entity48 in recent months and i 'm very sorry to hear about what happened to ms @entity10			0
' it 's clear to me that there is a serious problem in the management of the @entity48 from the number of complaints i 've been getting			0
' this case is particularly bad but long waits are a big problem			0
another problem is the unhelpfulness of call handlers on the telephone			0
' obviously there is a resource problem			0
the call handlers would n't be challenging the public if they could get the ambulances out to people			2

@entity10 , 57 , fell ill at home in @entity64 , @entity69
but family 's panic - stricken calls were mistaken for abuse , a panel found
that meant a paramedic was stood down because it ' could be unsafe '
call handler added : ' we do n't have ambulances waiting on street corners '
her partner @entity7 , 53 , is suing the @entity18 for clinical negligence
