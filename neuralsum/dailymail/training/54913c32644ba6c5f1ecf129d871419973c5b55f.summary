by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 01:52 est , 11 july 2012 the underworld masterminds of one of @entity4 ’s largest ever car cloning rackets made £ 1million selling stolen vehicles on the second - hand car market			1
@entity9 , 40 , and @entity10 , 33 , ' disguised ' vehicles using legitimate details from similar models and hawked them online via @entity14 and @entity15 , a @entity8 court heard			1
unsuspecting buyers duped by the elaborate scam answered adverts and bought the affordable cars , only to discover they had been stolen			1
crooked pair : @entity10 , left , and @entity9 oversaw a criminal network of around 16 accomplices who posed as sellers and provided addresses where deals could take place police discovered @entity9 and @entity10 ran a network of criminals in ' three tiers			1
' the crooked pair ' managed ' the list of stolen cars , while a sub-team posed as ' sellers ' and a third allowed the stolen vehicles to be sold at their addresses			1
each car had its number plates changed and new registration numbers used in adverts on market places so prospective buyers could make @entity43 checks			0
the gang also used blank v5 vehicle registration documents and blank road tax discs stolen from post offices , personal details of innocent people , forged @entity51 certificates , faked receipts of previous sales of the cars and even a bogus service history			1
@entity56 , 37 , whose @entity57 was stolen during a burglary at his home in @entity60 , @entity8 , was shocked to find out it had been sold to innocent dairy farmer @entity62 who lives 150 miles in @entity63			1
mr @entity62 , 40 , saw the car advertised on the @entity66 website and went to see it at a house in @entity69			2
he paid £ 11,500 for the @entity57 after innocently believing all the forged documentation to be genuine , including the vehicle identification number matching the chassis number in the windscreen			0
' too good to be true ' : farmer @entity62 paid £ 11,500 for a stolen @entity57 he was on @entity14 , believing the forged documents to be real detectives traced more than 60 cars valued at a total of £ 571,718 , which had been stolen and cloned including bmws , @entity79 , vws and a @entity82 pick - up truck			1
of these , 39 had been sold to innocent buyers , who paid a total of £ 280,000			1
police estimate the racket earned the gang more than £ 1m			2
@entity9 was today jailed for four years at @entity88 while @entity10 was given two years and four months after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and convert criminal property			2
sixteen accomplices are due to be sentenced later			0
father - of - two mr @entity62 said after the case : ' i remember my wife saying at the time the price was too good to be true and she was right			2
but he said he had gone through a really bitter divorce and he did n’t want his wife finding out			1
' he seemed genuine , i took the details of the registration and when i ran them passed the @entity101 , they said it all appeared legitimate and above board			1
' i had heard of people buying stolen cars at the pubs but we met this guy at what i thought was his home , so i did n’t question it			1
it was only when i sent the registration document to the @entity114 i found out it had been stolen and cloned			2
conned : mr @entity62 checked the registration details with the @entity101 and was told everything was above board ' police removed the spare wheel , the boot lining and showed me the chassis number that did n’t match the vehicle			2
i was absolutely furious and i felt so sick			0
' i was livid that somebody had got one over me and that i had been so naive			0
last year , i was employing a lad to work on the farm and since this , i ’ve had to cut his hours and take on more hours myself - even though i already work a 12 - hour day			0
i ’ve had no choice financially			0
' mr @entity56 , 37 , a freelance journalist , said : ' i do feel sorry for the guy that bought it because i imagine on @entity14 it looked like a great deal			2
' we felt we could n’t get the same car again because after it was stolen , what ’s to stop them coming back thinking the same car would be there again			0
we were also really scared that we were being watched			0
' police said @entity10 , of @entity142 , would be told a stolen car was ' available ' so he knew the make , model and specification			2
nightmare : the original owners of the cars , the buyers and the people whose identities were taken all suffered as a result of the villainous duo 's greed victims : the @entity57 stolen from @entity157 and sold to mr @entity62 by the tricksters elaborate detail : a forged @entity51 certificate , left , and a forged vehicle registration document , right he would then obtain the identities of similar models from a number of ' sources ' including the internet , or even from cars he spotted on the street			1
he would then pass these identities on to others so the true identity of the car was disguised			0
@entity10 also carried out car history checks by phone and put adverts on to online market places			0
@entity9 , of @entity69 would be told about cars that had been stolen and was known to sell some of them on , for profit			1
supt @entity182 from @entity183 said : ' the tragedy here was that for every vehicle involved , there were numerous victims throughout the process			0
' we have come across some tragic stories , such as victims of burglary who felt violated , people whose identities were hijacked , and those who saved up to buy the car that they needed , only to find themselves badly out of pocket			0
' today ’s outcome is the culmination of a sensitive , large - scale and thoroughly planned police operation into an organised criminal network			0
in short , these people made money from burglaries			0
' we urge prospective buyers of cars to always use bankers draft rather than cash , and we also want to make it clear that if a price looks too good to be true , there is every chance that it is			2
' convincing fake : one of the stolen tax discs used to make the cars seem legitimate @entity218 , senior crown prosecutor said : ' there were many victims of this gang - the owners who had their cars stolen and the innocent purchasers who bought the vehicles in good faith			1
' these are serious crimes that have a significant impact on victims in all sorts of ways			0
' a spokesman from @entity14 said : ' buyers should approach all online purchases with caution and assure themselves that they have enough information about a seller to be confident in a transaction before they part with their money			1
' @entity240 , consumer director for @entity43 said : ' sadly , the cloning of cars is a common practice used by organised crime groups to hide the identity of stolen vehicles			1
' a spokesman for @entity248 ( which owns @entity249 and @entity250 ) said : ' the sums involved show that this was ‘ big business ’ , highly organised crime			0
demands for ‘ cash only ’ should always set the alarm bells ringing			0
