by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 11:54 est , 9 july 2012 temp staff : @entity2 was in charge of the newly merged @entity4 and @entity5 for less than an hour before he was ousted in the history of golden parachutes it has to be the most generous of them all			1
the former boss of the largest electricity company in the @entity12 is to get a $ 44m payoff - for just 20 minutes work			1
@entity2 was in charge of the newly merged @entity4 and @entity5 for less than an hour before he was ousted			1
according to @entity16 filings he could walk away with the colossal farewell package in what a former colleague has called ‘ the most blatant example of corporate deceit ’ he had ever seen			1
utilities regulators are now considering investigating his abrupt resignation amid protests from shareholders			1
the attorney general in @entity27 , where @entity5 is based , is also demanding it hand over board meeting minutes and other documents relating to the merger			2

the $ 26billion merger of @entity5 and @entity4 had taken 18 months to hammer out and would have cemented @entity5 ’s position as the biggest electricity provider in @entity12			2
regulator the @entity39 had been told that mr @entity2 would take over as head of the newly formed company			0
but according to @entity43 board member @entity42 , mr @entity2 was asked to resign on monday afternoon by the board some 20 minutes after the deal closed at 4.02pm having already won regulatory approval			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity48 was then put in his place , the @entity47 reported			2
critics have claimed that the way it played out suggested it was choreographed beforehand			0
the motive could have been to ensure that the merger won regulatory approval or give mr @entity2 as good a payoff as possible			0

prominent : @entity5 is based in @entity27 ' in my opinion this is the most blatant example of corporate deceit that i have witnessed during a long career on @entity69 ’			1
former @entity71 board member @entity70 , added : ‘ frankly , i felt misled			0
‘ just from circumstantial evidence you would have to think it did n't happen overnight , that there was a lot of forethought given to it			0
’ the reaction of the markets was swift and credit rating firm @entity81 ’s put @entity5 on a watch list which could lead to a downgrade due to concerns over corporate governance			2
the drama also puts the spotlight on mr @entity48 again who has a remarkable record when it comes to coming out on top in mergers			0
a prolific networker , he frequently flies to @entity94 where he dines with heads of state and world leaders , racking up $ 406,000 on corporate jet expenses last year alone			0
office : @entity2 was in charge of the newly merged @entity4 and @entity5 for less than an hour before he was ousted on two almost identical such mergers in the past he has wound up being the chief executive of the combined company - even if others were not so fortunate			1
