by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity1 nearly scored one of the strangest goals ever seen in @entity4 on monday night , slotting home after a mishit long - range cross from @entity7 despite the ball hitting the stanchion ... not the crossbar			1
just after the hour mark , @entity1 slotted home past @entity12 , who had not made an effort to stop the ball , before the @entity16 striker celebrated with an embarrassed look on his face			1
video scroll to watch post-match reaction from @entity20 ca n't believe it : @entity1 walked off with an embarrassed look on his face after the ' goal ' out : the ball clearly hits the stanchion before bouncing out towards @entity1 to slot home referee @entity28 initially gave the goal , despite the ball having hit the stanchion of @entity12 's goal , not the crossbar			1
then , the referee consulted his linesman , before ruling the goal out			2
there were no complaints from @entity39 's players as @entity12 resumed the game			0
it is not certain whether the linesman may have seen one of the replays on the big screens inside the @entity46 in @entity4 , but replays showed the ball had clearly gone out of play just behind the goal before bounding back into @entity1 's path			1

@entity39 are title contenders - @entity62 looking on : @entity1 watches his effort slot in from the tightest of angles as @entity67 looks dejected delighted : striker @entity1 wheels off in celebration after bringing @entity39 level in @entity4			0

*confusion* in the second - half as @entity1 slotted home after the ball seemed to hit the crossbar
the goal was intially given , but replays clearly showed the ball hit the stanchion and was out of play
the linesman then *instructed* referee @entity28 to rule out the goal
