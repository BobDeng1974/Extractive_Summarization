a transgender comedian is the latest real life model to star in a campaign for clothing label @entity3 , in which she models a variety of her favorite feminine styles			1
@entity7 , 32 , a @entity8 - based writer and self - confessed ' gender rebel ' , has been a fan of @entity3 's designs for years , and often posts pictures of herself wearing the clothing on the company 's @entity14 , an open fashion forum where customers can showcase how they have styled each item to suit their own personal tastes			1
it was through these images that @entity22 caught the eye of the label 's executives , who were quick to contact her about starring as one of @entity3 's monthly @entity29 campaign stars , a group of individuals who help the brand to get across the message that fashion is for everyone , no matter what their size , shape or gender			1
fashion star : comedian @entity41 ( pictured ) is the newest star of @entity3 's @entity44 campaign dressed to impress : the 32 - year - old @entity8 resident has long - been a fan of the brand 's clothing collection , and frequently posts images of herself on the @entity3 open fashion forum ' five years ago today , i came out of the closet , ' @entity50 explained on the @entity3 website			1
' today , these are the clothes that came out of my closet			0
' i try to have new adventures or do things that scare me			0
that ’s what my cross-country moves [ from @entity61 to @entity62 to @entity8 ] were about , and in a big way , my coming out as transgender			2
' i ’d started getting real open and honest onstage in my act , and one day i realized i could n’t really be honest if i was living a lie			2
so i guess that ’s what the most important thing is to me , living an honest , real life and not holding back			0
' i waited years for someone to come along and tell me that it was okay to be myself before i finally realized that someone was me			0
that ’s what fashion is all about for me - taking how you feel and using your style as an expression of that			2
' while speaking to the brand about the campaign , @entity50 explained how society 's attitude toward her has changed since she made the decision to come out as a transgender , noting that many people feel that they are entitled to question her motives for doing so			1
breaking out : @entity50 , who came out as a transgender when she was 27 , says that ' living an honest life ' is the most important thing to her personal style : one of @entity22 's favorite items from the @entity3 range is the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , but she admits she enjoys experimenting with her style ' i think the downright most rude thing is when people flat out just ask me about my plans for transitioning , usually some variation on if i intend to have surgery or not , which is an extremely personal question if you break it down			1
it ’s basically “ so what ’s up with your junk ? ” ' she explained			0
' it ’s also an issue because it puts an emphasis on specific treatments as being indicative of if someone is or is n’t " really " trans. that can be a really dangerous attitude to run into for someone who ’s just coming to terms with themselves or on the cusp of coming out			0
' when it comes to her sense of style , @entity50 admits that she loves experimenting with different ensembles and trends			0
' [ my sense of style ] evolves over time but i think right now my best way of describing it is a bit of a quirky or edgy twist on vintage , ' she explained			0
' i love rockabilly - type stuff or circle skirts that have interesting prints on them			2
' the two garments i currently get the most positive responses to are my @entity100 from @entity3 and my @entity145 - themed circle skirt			1
i ’ve noticed in the last year or so more and more of my skirts and dresses have fun prints			0
but when i ’m kind of just looking for a more relaxed , chill look i shift into a more 90s vibe			0
' polka dot : @entity22 was chosen to feature in the campaign by @entity3 's co-creator @entity153 call for change : @entity3 's @entity44 campaign hopes to prove that fashion is accessible to everyone , no matter their shape , size , gender or style in honor of her starring role in the campaign , and her ongoing love of fashion , @entity3 has actually named a dress from its range after @entity22 , the aptly - named @entity170			1
@entity3 's @entity44 campaign was first launched back in september , pledging at the time that the company would endeavor to feature diverse , real life models , and offer a variety of clothing sizes and styles			1
earlier this year , the brand used a group of its own employees as models for its most recent swimwear campaign , with the aim of proving that its styles were fit for real people of all shapes and sizes			1
' the real hope around this is that we are putting the idea in everyone 's heads that every size and shape and body , every single person - every woman - is just beautiful , ' modcloth employee - turned - model @entity186 said of the campaign at the time			2
' and as long as she is trying to be the best version of herself , which we say a lot here at @entity3 , that 's perfect			2
we hope that this is eventually the regular mindset in our society : that the best version of yourself is the best version there is			0

@entity7 , from @entity8 , was chosen as one of the brand 's monthly @entity29 campaign stars
the 32 - year - old comedian often posts pictures of herself wearing @entity3 clothing on the brand 's open fashion forum , which is how she was *spotted*
