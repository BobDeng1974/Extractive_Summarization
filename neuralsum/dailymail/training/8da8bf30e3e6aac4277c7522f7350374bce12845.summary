the @entity1 river in @entity2 is regarded by many as the most beautiful in the world			0
known as the ' liquid rainbow , ' the spectacular waters are turned into a kaleidoscope of colour thanks to freshwater plants known as macarenia clavigera and endemic to the @entity10 , a mountain range south of the capital @entity13			1
during the short time between the wet and dry season , july to november , along with moss , aquatic plants and corals , the red plants cling to rocks throughout the 62 - mile long river , and help create a fusion of colours just under the surface of the water			1
@entity45 , blue , black , red and yellow are all very visible during the season and locals say the best time to see the plants at their brightest is just after a storm , when the colours appear at their most vivid			0
the geological formation of the river is rich with sediment , and the rocks are some 1.2 billion years old			0
this , combined with the different - coloured plantation helps create the prism of colour			2
but for half the year , the river is much like any other ; the bed of rocks creating a shimmering grey colour , with the odd splashes of green moss along the way			1
looking like something from a pre-historic age , the colours of the plants almost make the water appear blood red tourists were warned from travelling to the @entity1 prior to 2009 due to terrorism and threats of damaging the environment however , the @entity1 is not accessible by road ; instead tourists will have to fly into @entity81 , then organise a short transfer to the @entity83 , where they can then make the last part of the journey by foot or on horseback			1
the @entity1 season runs from mid may to the start of december			0
it is not possible to book tours outside of these dates			0
the site was only re-opened to tourists in 2009 after years of terrorist activity , as well as the perceived threat of humans damaging the natural environment			0
there are also other important waterfalls such as @entity101 in the @entity103 and @entity104 rivers , surrounded by rocky edges with a great amount of ' petroglifos ' ( rock engravings ) , making the national park a sight to behold			2
you almost ca n't believe this is a river - but the @entity1 stretches over 60 miles and is wonderous in colours the macarenia clavigera , left , is indigenous to the area of the macarenia clavigera , and right , the sunshine shows off the beauty the clean and clear waters offer tourists the chance to discover just what causes such a fusion of colours in the @entity1			1

the macarenia clavigera , indigenous to the area , helps create a spectacular river view
the beautiful red plants cling to the rocky bed , clashing beautifully with green moss and clear blue water
*situated* in the @entity83 national park , that was a no - go area for tourists before 2009
