@entity0 is here at @entity1 to talk football			1
@entity3 have a new manager in @entity5 , they are in a battle against the drop and he is keen to impress how the club have changed and how they can withstand the shock of relegation should that day come			1
but it is hard to focus entirely on matters on the pitch			1
for @entity0 is also the face of @entity15 and describes the last seven weeks as the ‘ worst 50 days of my life ’			1
it was on december 28 that @entity15 flight @entity18 with 162 people on board crashed into the sea between @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity0 describes the last seven weeks ' as the worst 50 days of my life ' following the @entity15 tragedy @entity15 flight @entity18 crashed into the sea between @entity23 and @entity24 with 162 people on board ‘ i think the only way i do know how to manage these things is with my heart , ’ says @entity0 , owner and chief executive of @entity15			1
‘ just confront it and deal with it			1
it has just been a nightmare to be honest			1
the only way i know how to deal with it is to deal with it			1
‘ i get text messages every day from the families			1
they all have my mobile phone number			1
i ’ve been going to funerals and that ’s hard			1
but the families have been amazing to us			1
they ’ve given me strength			2
’ @entity0 dealt with the tragedy by flying immediately to @entity47 to assist with the search for the plane and , ultimately , the bodies			1
there he was confronted by the victims ’ families			2
‘ that was really hard			2
what do you say to someone who has lost five people on their plane ? i do n’t know			2
human nature , whatever , gives you the strength to find a way			2
burying my own staff was a nightmare			2
taking a 22 - year - old girl on a plane and burying her in her home town			2
but you find the strength			2
it ’s not our fault			2
but what else can you say ? they were on my aircraft			2
and they ’re not with them			2
and we just sat and talked and made them feel very comfortable that whatever happens , we would find them and we would n’t give up			2
and i think that was very reassuring			2
we have n’t found everyone yet			2
there are still more than 50 people unaccounted for			2
but we just talked to them and let them talk to me , show me pictures and tell stories			2
’ the @entity3 owner is also chief executive of @entity15 and has attended the funerals of those killed in the tragedy in such circumstances it would be inhuman to worry about football and what was going on at @entity3 , and the club necessarily was not his first priority			1
‘ i remember turning on to watch the @entity97 game [ in the @entity98 ] — and turning it off pretty quickly			2
no , it was n’t top of my list			0
i remember there was a draw with @entity105			0
i still wanted @entity3 to win			1
i still had one eye on looking at @entity107 and hoping to see a goal			0
‘ your life becomes split in two : you have to deal with the pain but you also have to make sure you deal with the people who are still alive and provide their livelihoods and @entity3 is one of those			1
’ almost two months on , his energies are still clearly focused on the crash investigation but he is now as committed to @entity3 as ever in what has been a difficult period			1
he insists he was surprised as anyone that @entity119 resigned three weeks ago after a quiet transfer window			0
‘ no one believes me but i never expected @entity119 to want to resign , ’ he says			0
@entity5 ( right ) has been tasked with keeping @entity3 in the @entity122 after @entity119 resigned @entity0 shares a joke with @entity3 defender @entity124 after visiting the training ground last week however , the ‘ boring ’ transfer window does mean @entity3 are now shedding their image as a soft touch			1
@entity0 knows what agents in the game think : that @entity3 is the place you go in order to offload older and expensive players			1
‘ @entity137 players looking for a massive pay - out , ’ he says			0
that ’s all gone and players know now			0
we ’re going to have a great wage bill next year			0
’ he cites the debut of midfielder @entity146 , 22 , a @entity3 trainee , in the 2 - 0 win at @entity148 as the model the club will now aim for , with @entity151 appointed director of football			1
‘ there were certain managers who wanted to go for more experience than youth , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ what do you do ? you keep pushing the manager , saying : “ try this , try this , try this ”			0
and he wants a different type of player			0
but at least this season everyone we bought [ last summer ] had some sell - on value and was young enough			0
we did n’t do @entity168			0
@entity169 was offered to us and we just did n’t do any of those			0
it never got past page one			0
we ’ve created the right atmosphere now			0
’ @entity3 midfielder @entity146 made his debut for the @entity3 against @entity148 two weeks ago @entity0 shares a joke with @entity3 's director of football @entity151 during the club 's defeat at @entity179 for now , @entity5 will manage the team and , even if the club is relegated , he may keep the job			1
‘ i do n’t think that makes a difference , i really do n’t			0
it ’s how he manages the next 15 games			0
’ before promoting @entity5 from coach , @entity0 tweeted about having spoken to his ‘ dream manager ’			1
the smart money is that he meant @entity190 , the @entity191 coach , whose father once played at @entity3			1
he fits the profile of what @entity0 wants : a coach who will promote young players			1
@entity197 will not confirm that but admits that @entity190 and @entity200 manager @entity199 have been considered			1
‘ some of those names are definitely names we considered			0
he ’s a great guy and i ’ve spoken to him many times			0
@entity199 has done a great job at @entity200 — so you have to consider someone like that			0
@entity208 was never in the picture			0
my focus is just on @entity5 right now			0
’ @entity200 boss @entity199 and @entity191 coach @entity190 have both impressed @entity0 whatever happens , he claims to be confident the club are now under control			1
it has not always seemed that way			0
in 2012 - 13 , the year they went down to the @entity217 , the club lost £ 65.3million			0
the club ’s wage bill was £ 78.0m , more than its entire turnover of £ 60.6m			0
the accounts for 2013 - 14 are out next month and even if they have improved — several expensive players were offloaded , though they had to absorb the pain of losing @entity122 tv money — it seems difficult to see how they can avoid a huge fine under the @entity229 ’s new @entity228 rules if they go back down			1
what complicates the matter is that the @entity229 have since changed their rules , making them more lenient , and @entity0 has sent a clear signal that he expects to be judged under the most - recent rules			1
‘ one of the great things is that a precedent has been set in that they ’ve changed the rules already , ’ he says			0
‘ that in itself is a great legal argument			0
’ and @entity0 says that the club can cope with relegation without huge amounts of fresh subsidies from himself and the @entity247 family , which has kept the club afloat up to now			1
‘ that fear of getting relegated has gone now			0
if we get relegated , we get relegated and we build			0
@entity252 were a @entity254 side , right ? look at them now			0
’ @entity0 celebrates @entity3 's play - off victory at @entity257 last may as the club clinched promotion since he took over in 2011 , almost every transfer window has felt like panic stations , planning for the worst - case scenario			1
‘ well , this time we ’ve said : “ * * * * it ” , ’ he says			0
‘ we ’re going to think for the long term			0
because every six months we were fighting against relegation and i saw a window and would buy players			0
it has always been that			0
‘ then you ’re in the @entity217 and you ’re fighting for promotion and it ’s , “ ok , we need some more players			0
it ’s worth buying because we ’ll get £ 60m when we ’re back in the @entity122 ”			1
’ it has taken almost four years but it seems as though he may have finally got on top of football .			1
