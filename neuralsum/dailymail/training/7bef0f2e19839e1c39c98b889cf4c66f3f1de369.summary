' to which @entity28 replied : ' that 's so sweet that you want me to be empowered			0
does [ @entity18 ] care to empower me by paying my $ 118k - and counting - in bills ? ' other @entity9 users waded in on the argument , many mocking the choice of words used by @entity10			1

arijit asked him : ' true or false : i am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product ? ' and @entity18 replied : ' false			0
why do you think the premium was so low ? do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance ( auto ) ?

' after a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone			0
