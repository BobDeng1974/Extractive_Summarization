published : 19:48 est , 9 april 2014 updated : 08:04 est , 10 april 2014 the final @entity0 was pulled from the depths of a sinkhole at a @entity4 museum on wednesday , but it was barely recognizable to its owner			1
the 2001 @entity7 was buried in dirt and rocks , deep beneath the surface of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the rescue of its mangled remains completed weeks of painstaking work to retrieve eight classic cars that were gobbled up by the gaping hole			1
' it looks like a piece of tin foil , ' said @entity32 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , who donated the car to the museum last december			1
' i 'm still glad i 'm here , because i would have never believed it was this bad			2
i 'm not positive i would have recognized it			2
' at around the time it was donated , the car was appraised at $ 125,000 because of the performance modifications , said museum spokeswoman @entity44			2
the cars looked like toys piled in a heap amid dirt and concrete fragments after the 40 - foot - wide - by - 60 - foot - deep sinkhole opened beneath a museum display area in mid-february			1
it happened when the museum was closed , and no one was injured			2
the other cars that took the plunge were a 1962 black @entity0 , a 1993 @entity57 , a 1984 @entity58 , a 1992 white 1 @entity59 , a 2009 white 1.5 @entity60 , a 2009 @entity61 and a 1993 @entity63 40th @entity62			2
the eight cars are widely believed to have a total value exceeding $ 1 million , the museum said			2
sinkholes are common in the @entity12 area , which is located amid a large region of bedrock the first car was pulled out of the hole in march and suffered relatively minor damage the museum owned six of the cars , and the other two — the @entity57 and @entity61 — were on loan from @entity79			1
sinkholes are common in the @entity12 area , which is located amid a large region of bedrock known as karst where many of @entity4 's largest and deepest caves run underground			1
with the retrieval now complete , the next task is to assess which cars are repairable			2
' they seem to run the gamut — from very minor or superficial damage to catastrophic damage , ' said @entity92 , a spokesman for @entity93 , which will oversee restoration of the cars in @entity97			2
the first car hoisted out in early march — the @entity61 — suffered only minor damage that included cracks on lower door panels , a busted window and a ruptured oil line			0
workers got that car running , and cheers went up as the engine revved			1
the mood turned more dour as the damage became progressively worse as each car was pulled out			0
the white 1.5 @entity0 recovered recently was flattened by the weight of debris			0
the @entity57 and the @entity58 , also among the final cars retrieved , sustained considerable damage as well , @entity44 said			0
unstable : five of the damaged iconic cars were owned by the museum and the other three by @entity79 , but staff managed to remove an irreplaceable 1983 @entity0 from the facility significant damage : when security arrived they discovered a sinkhole 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep with the iconic vehicles at the bottom			1
the one millionth @entity0 , which was donated to the museum by @entity93 , was among the cars that fell into the sinkhole we have an opening : a helicopter drone was used to survey the devastation left after a giant sinkhole opened up and swallowed some vintage corvettes at the @entity11 in @entity4 all eight cars will be on display at the museum through august			1
the decisions about which ones to repair and which are too damaged to fix will be heart - wrenching			0
' that 's going to be a fairly difficult discussion , ' @entity92 said			0
whether repair crews can retain the authenticity of each classic car will be a big factor , officials said			0
' it would be fairly easy to go find another white 2009 @entity0 and take as many parts off that car and put them onto a new structure with the @entity150 number of this ( original ) car , ' @entity92 said			0
' you start splitting the line of — did we restore the 1.5 millionth car or did we build an all - new car			0
' cars considered too badly damaged wo n't go on the scrap heap			0
publicity surrounding the massive sinkhole has led to an attendance boost at the museum ' i 'm sure that we 'll continue to display them as is			1
it 's now a part of museum and @entity0 history , ' @entity44 said			0
' it 's interesting to people			0
they are n't going into storage somewhere			0
' the museum has remained open , except for the area where the sinkhole occurred , and the publicity has led to an attendance boost			1
attendance in march was up 56 percent from the same month a year ago , @entity44 said			0
publicity surrounding the massive sinkhole has led to an attendance boost at the museum			1
repairs to the museum , which is near the factory where the iconic corvettes are made , are expected to be completed by early august , ahead of the museum 's late summer @entity190 — a celebration marking the museum 's 20th anniversary			1
thousands of @entity0 enthusiasts are expected to converge in their models of the classic @entity197 sports car .			0
