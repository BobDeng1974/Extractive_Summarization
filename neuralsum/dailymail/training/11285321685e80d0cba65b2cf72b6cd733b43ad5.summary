by @entity1 reporter published : 08:59 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 12 june 2013 pensioners who sold their homes in hope of a dream retirement have today told an inquiry how their hopes were shattered after learning they had actually been sold part time holiday homes			1
residents of the @entity12 development , near @entity13 , @entity14 , said they were ' blissfully unaware ' when they sold their old homes that they were actually moving into holiday accommodation rather than permanent residences			1
a council has rejected retrospective planning permission for them to be used as full - time houses leaving them with the prospect of being evicted			1
@entity12 , in @entity13 , where pensioners who have paid £ 130,00 for their homes face eviction			1
from left @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 and @entity29 and @entity30 a fraud investigation is running at the same time as the planning inquiry			1
four people have been arrested as part of the alleged fraudulent selling of the homes			2
more than 100 pensioners in 78 homes are affected			2
they include sufferers of lung cancer , parkinson ’s disease , arthritis , diabetes , and other crippling ailments who need homes with easy access , and had given up their jobs looking forward to a mortgage - free life away from city estates			2
the planning inquiry is currently under way to decide whether @entity53 was right to refuse them retrospective planning permission			1
@entity55 , 61 , and his wife sold their bungalow to buy their £ 140,000 park home on the site			2
mr @entity55 said : ' we found out to our dismay we had purchased a holiday home - not a permanent home			2
' we were in a complete state of shock			0
we would be devastated if we had to leave the site and do not have the money to purchase another property			0
' residents at the park were ' blissfully unaware ' when they sold their old homes that they were actually moving into holiday accommodation rather than permanent residences a council rejected retrospective planning permission for them to be used as full - time houses leaving them with the prospect of being evicted residents say they sold up and bought the properties as full - time homes , but were then told the park homes are only for holiday use and they must have another permanent address			1
retired civil servant @entity87 was one of the first to move onto the park , and had been ' blissfully unaware ' anything was wrong after selling his bungalow			1
he is one of the guiding lights of an appeal against @entity53 ’s refusal to grant the consent for permanent homes on the site			1
he and his frail wife had been living there more than two years before council bosses wrote to them to say there was a planning problem			0
he told the inquiry : ' i ca n’t see we are doing much harm			0
' we live in a nice community and pay our taxes			0
i ca n’t understand the council ’s view for us to have to leave			0
' barrister @entity111 , representing mr @entity87 , told the first day of the inquiry that the outcome would affect every person living there			0
in her opening statement , miss @entity111 said : ' the dismissal of this appeal will result in all the residents of this site losing their homes			0
residents say they sold up and bought the properties as full - time homes , but were then told the park homes are only for holiday use and they must have another permanent address ' they ’ll be made homeless and you will hear about the difficulties they will face			1
' barrister @entity131 , representing @entity53 , said : ' the establishment of a retirement park home village in the open countryside would set a precedent that would inevitably encourage breaches elsewhere			1
' this is particularly the case in this council ’s area , which has a substantial number of caravans in holiday use			0
the council maintains this is a flagrant breach of planning control and the development is contrary to the development plan			0
' those arrested as part of the fraud inquiry include a solicitor of 40 years , a 50 - year - old man , a 52 - year - old woman , and a 31 - year - old woman from @entity13			2
