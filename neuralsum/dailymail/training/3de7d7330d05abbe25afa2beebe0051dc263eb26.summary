by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 19 april 2013 it 's certainly a romantic gesture - putting a message in a bottle and throwing it into the sea in the hope it reaches its destination			2
but perhaps it 's not the most practical way of expressing yourself , as one bottle took 28 years to be discovered - nearly 5,000 miles away			1
in 1985 a man called @entity12 penned the note ' @entity14 , you are really great person			0
i hope we can keep in correspondence			0
i said i would write			0
your friend forever , @entity12 , @entity19 , 1985 , ' tucked it into a bottle , and threw it into the @entity23			1
a man called @entity12 is believed to have thrown the bottle containing a sentimental note into the @entity23 the bottle washed up in @entity28 - almost 4,000 miles from where it believed to have been flung in the sea now , finally , it has been washed ashore and discovered in @entity32 , almost 8,000 kilometres ( 4,971 miles ) away			1
the message , written in blue ink with a ball - point pen was still intact because it was plastic coated , and found by 23 - year - old @entity32 @entity38 , @entity33 reported			2
' the bottle was among the rubbish that winter rains have brought to the shore , ' @entity39 told @entity44			2
ms @entity39 , who found the sentimental note as she helped with a beach clean - up near the @entity47 port of @entity28 , near @entity48 , is now appealing for the mystery pair to come forward			2
she has posted a picture of the note and bottle on @entity53 , writing : ' @entity54 ! from @entity56 to the @entity58 estuary for 28 years ! ! ' the @entity55 reported			0
the bottle was thrown into the ocean in @entity19 in 1985 and turned up in @entity32 28 years later the message in a bottle took 28 years to be washed ashore - and now the finer is trying to reach the writer @entity66 users have speculated about the relationship between the couple , and how @entity12 could have expected it to reach @entity14			1
if the bottle was thrown from @entity19 , it could have travelled across the @entity23 and into the @entity72			1
to reach the @entity47 , it is possible that it could have gone through the @entity75			0
it certainly took a lot longer than a romantic message - in - a - bottle from @entity79 , which took just six days to be washed ashore on a @entity81 beach and discovered by a mother and daughter			1
last august @entity84 , 41 , and daughter @entity85 , four , from @entity86 , near @entity87 , were scouring @entity88 when they came across an old glass bottle sticking out of the sand containing a note inside written in @entity93			0
while the letter bears the date in line with the lunar calendar - july 7 , 2012 - it could have been sent off as recently as six days previously if it followed the modern calendar .			0

bottle believed to have travelled nearly 5,000 miles to reach @entity32
