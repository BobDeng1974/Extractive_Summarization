it should have been a piece of cake			0
but this was the hilarious result when a studio photographer tried to get a toddler to smash a cake to mark his first birthday			1
instead of happily getting messy , little @entity6 did everything but and spent an hour crawling around the studio			1
but no matter how many times they did it the wilful toddler flatly refused to do as he was told and get messy with the bright blue iced sponge			1
the youngster eventually ended up covered in some of the cake , although he did n’t fully demolish it as planned			0
but @entity10 turned the session into a funny time - lapse video which is now going viral			1
no matter how many times they tried , the wilful toddler flatly refused to do as he was told and get messy with the bright blue iced sponge photographer @entity10 turned the session into a funny time - lapse video which is now going viral @entity10 and @entity6 's mother @entity16 patiently kept picking him up and putting him next to the cake but he was n't having any of it professional portrait snapper @entity10 created the brilliant time - lapse video of him painstakingly trying to get little @entity6 to smash his birthday cake as a souvenir for his parents and family @entity16 , 26 , said : ' i ’ve known @entity10 for years , and he took some pictures of @entity6 when he was just five days old , so for his first birthday , we wanted to do something special			1
' @entity10 said he ’d done a couple of shoots of toddlers smashing cakes , and said they made brilliant photos , so i said " go for it			1
" ' the bright blue cake looked gorgeous and delicious , but @entity6 was having none of it			1
' it was the first time he had had cake , and he just did n’t like it			0
' he was more interested in everything else in the studio rather than the cake itself , which is strange , because he loves getting messy when he eats			0
' it was funny more than anything , and @entity10 really does have the patience of a saint			2
' @entity16 has known @entity10 for years and he took some pictures of @entity6 when he was just five days old , so for his first birthday , they wanted to do something special @entity10 charges between £ 95 for a cake smash shoot and a pictures , up to £ 250 for the entire package and dozens of high - resolution shots speaking about the shoot , @entity10 said : ' we persevered , dealt with tears and tantrums and in the end i think we managed to get some really nice shots ' @entity10 , who runs @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , came up with the idea of shooting children bashing cakes after seeing pictures of messy babies			1
the photographer , who also works in marketing , has been doing photography for the last ten years , but reckons little @entity6 was his most trying client			1
@entity10 , 30 , said : ' i ’m a patient man , but @entity6 tested me to almost the limit			1
' for more than an hour we tried every way possible to get him interested in smashing the cake , but he was just not in the mood			2
' usually , when shooting young children you normally have about a 20 - minute window before they get bored			0
' @entity6 , on the other hand , gave me about 20 seconds of his attention before becoming bored and crawled off			2
' we persevered , dealt with tears and tantrums and in the end i think we managed to get some really nice shots			0
' the concept started in the @entity106 , but it is slowly making its way over here			2
some kids have sat down and not left the cake until it is completely gone - but not @entity6 @entity10 charges between £ 95 for a cake smash shoot and a pictures , up to £ 250 for the entire package and dozens of high - resolution shots			1

some kids have sat down and not left the cake until it is completely gone			0
' but @entity122 had other ideas - he seemed to crawl pretty everywhere except towards the cake			0
' i used toys , funny voices , silly faces , and everything else i could think of , but he just was n’t interested			0
' they do say " never work with children or animals " but it was such a good laugh i ’d happily do it again			0
