@entity0 wo n’t get carried away watching @entity3 ’s @entity2 opener against @entity4 on saturday after what happened to him four years ago			1
the @entity3 , who is defending his @entity7 title this week , was leading the @entity8 on the @entity9 by three shots when he tuned into @entity3 ’s gut - wrenching 4 - 2 defeat to @entity12			1
‘ it was a big game , an emotional football match and then i never really calmed down , ' @entity13 recalled in his pre-tournament press conference at @entity17 on tuesday			1
keeping concentration : @entity0 insists he wo n't let @entity3 's @entity2 campaign derail his @entity7 bid ‘ i think i watched it about 10 in the morning , we were playing at 2 o’clock in the afternoon and i ended up going out and losing the golf tournament			1
’ @entity13 has a tough task on his hands to defend the title he won at @entity29 12 months ago , with former @entity31 captain @entity30 the last man to win back - to - back titles in 1988 and 1989			1
but there could also be a good omen in the fact that prior to @entity30 , the legendary @entity37 was the last man to do so in 1950 and 1951 , with the first of those wins coming at @entity29			2
' i ’ve allowed myself that thought for sure , ' said @entity13 when asked about retaining the title			1
prize guy : @entity13 will be hoping to retain his @entity7 trophy ' obviously that ’s the plan this week			1
i felt like i had a good opportunity in 2012 at @entity48 , too			1
i played really well there			2
i finished six shots back but as a player sometimes it ’s a lot closer than that			2
' i feel like the @entity7 test suits me			2
for me being defending champion , i do n’t even like that word , defending , because it puts you already behind the eight ball			2
you do n’t want to be out there being defensive at all			0
' i ’m just really excited about the opportunity this week presents			0
obviously it is only one guy who has the opportunity to repeat , but i ’m seeing that as a pressure - free situation			0
' these tournaments are so hard to win , i ’m just going to enjoy the challenge of trying to do that			0
' i was the first @entity3 guy for 40 - odd years ( since @entity40 in 1970 ) to win			1
but also it was my first major championship			0
any time you win a major championship there ’s probably history that ’s made in some way or another			0
' to win it again , the most important thing is my second major championship , but obviously to go back - to - back when it ’s been a while since someone has been able to do that , that would just be the icing on the cake			0
' upward curve : @entity13 has gone from strength to strength in recent years @entity13 famously turned professional the day after finishing fourth as a 17 - year - old amateur in the @entity97 in 1998 , but missed his first 21 halfway cuts in succession			1
a first @entity101 title arrived in 2002 and the 33 - year - old has made steady progress ever since , culminating in his emotional victory on @entity105 last year when he held off @entity106 and @entity107 to win by two shots			2
' the last few years of my career have been definitely on an upward trend and winning bigger and bigger tournaments , culminating in winning a major , ' added @entity13 , who pointed to the heavens after holing out on the 72nd hole in memory of his late father @entity116			1
pressure free : @entity13 reckons he can enjoy his golf after getting the monkey off his back last year ' i have n’t been one of the guys who have said ‘ well i ’m going to win x amount of majors in my career ’			1
so i really want to treat this major that i ’ve won now as a gift and that gives me the ability to now sort of freewheel for the rest of my career , play free , play loose , just go after it			0
i ’ve got really no pressure on me from that perspective any more			0
' i think a lot of us put a lot of pressure on ourselves to get over the hump in a major championship			0
just from an odds standpoint , they ’re hard to win			0
' so the fact i have won now , i think that really gives me the ability to have fun doing it again			0
hopefully that will give me an advantage down the stretch on future occasions			0

@entity13 wo n't let @entity151 ' @entity2 bid derail his own goals
thirty three year old blew lead after watching defeat to @entity12 in 2012
@entity3 insists he wo n't make the same *mistake* again at @entity17
