by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 14:22 est , 27 october 2013 victim : @entity3 was gunned down in his car last year @entity7 police investigating the massacre of a @entity10 man and his family in the @entity12 are furious at their @entity10 counterparts for not allowing them to bug the prime suspect – the dead man ’s brother			1
the reluctance of the @entity10 authorities to sanction the hacking of phone calls and other communication involving @entity21 , 54 , has led to a rift which has compromised the inquiry			1
revelations about the dispute came as the @entity7 prosecutor co-ordinating the investigation , launched his most outspoken attack yet on mr @entity21 , who denies any involvement			1
making it abundantly clear he still considers the accountant to have been involved in the crime - despite the paucity of evidence against him - prosecutor @entity37 said mr @entity21 was driven by ‘ a feeling of hate and vengeance ’			1
mr @entity21 has , in turn , accused mr @entity37 of displaying racism towards him because of his @entity45 @entity44 background , claiming he is trying to frame him to protect a @entity7 killer with influential connections			1
it was mr @entity37 and his colleagues who , more than a year ago , first urged the @entity10 to monitor all of mr @entity21 ’s telephone and computer communication			1
they were convinced he played a part in the murder of his brother @entity55 , 50 , on a remote road in the @entity12 in september , 2012			2
@entity55 was gunned down along with his wife @entity57 , 47 , and his mother - in - law @entity58 , 74			1
@entity7 cyclist @entity59 , 45 , was also murdered in the ambush close to @entity61			0
the @entity63 ’ seven - year - old daughter , @entity62 , was shot in the shoulder while her sister @entity65 , four , hid underneath her mother ’s skirt in the back of the family ’s @entity69			0
@entity71 : @entity72 denies any involvement in his brother 's death @entity72 was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in january and is currently on police bail			1
one of the reasons the @entity10 finally agreed to arrest him was because of an alleged series of phone calls to @entity83			2
‘ there has been no movement on this side of the inquiry at all , ’ a senior investigating source based outside of the @entity10 told @entity84			0
‘ things could have been very different if we had been able to tap the suspect early on , and possibly catch him out			0
’ under the @entity95 , @entity10 police and security services need a warrant , signed by the home secretary , before they can initiate a phone tap			2
mystery : the scene of the killing in the @entity12 last year , which was believed to target the @entity103 family restrictions on hacking are less stringent in @entity7 and mr @entity37 has always made it clear that he wanted to see mr @entity21 , who lives in @entity107 , @entity108 , arrested as soon as possible			1
he said : ‘ if @entity72 was living in @entity7 he would have been interrogated and probably taken into custody because that ’s a technique we use			0
’ in his latest interview on friday , mr @entity37 revived the theory that @entity21 was involved in a bitter dispute with @entity55 over their father ’s will			1
referring to @entity72 , mr @entity37 said : ‘ it ’s true that he presents an interesting profile as he is animated by a feeling of hate and vengeance			0
’ road : mr @entity59 and the @entity124 were killed by an unknown assassin near @entity61 @entity21 is convinced that cyclist mr @entity59 was the real target of the killer – but mr @entity37 refuses to contemplate that possibility , insisting that mr @entity59 was merely an unlucky passer - by			2
none of the forces involved in the investigation – which include both @entity108 and the @entity133 – would discuss the bugging claims , or tensions between officers , because of ‘ operational reasons ’			0
there were more claims about the @entity140 released by @entity7 prosecutors last week			0
they said @entity3 had a ‘ heated ’ argument with an unidentified person at the campsite where the family were staying the night before he was killed			2
next week , @entity148 images of a motorcyclist and the driver of a @entity69 seen at the time of the killings will be released by the @entity7			0
they are based on descriptions provided by local forestry workers .			0

@entity3 and his family were attacked by a gunman last year
mr @entity21 and his wife , @entity57 , were killed , and one of his daughters injured
@entity72 , @entity55 's brother , is the prime suspect in the murder , despite a lack of evidence
a source involved in the investigation said they wanted to tap his phone early on , but were not allowed to by @entity10 authorities
