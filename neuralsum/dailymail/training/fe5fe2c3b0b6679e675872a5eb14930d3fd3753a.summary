@entity0 started his first @entity1 for 10 months on monday night after @entity2 injured his calf in training			1
it was not exactly a good omen for @entity7			2
his previous four league matches each ended in defeat			0
registering at a shot speed of 62.1mph , @entity20 goalkeeper was left with no chance as @entity7 burst into a surprise ninth minute lead			1
the goal came from a devastating move , which showed how quickly the @entity7 can turn defence into attack			2
it took just under 11 seconds for the home side to work the ball from @entity0 's gloves to the back of @entity36 's net , as @entity37 showed pace and vision to feed @entity16			2
the @entity41 midfielder still had plenty to do when the ball reached him on the edge of the box , but his strike gave @entity47 no chance			0
as opposed to @entity50 , who instructed his team to play a third different formation of the season , @entity49 stuck with the 5 - 2 - 3 - 1 system he has employed throughout this campaign			1
it was also the same outfield line - up that brought him wins against @entity57 and @entity58			0
@entity50 's tactical adjustment saw @entity20 struggle , but his substitutions seemed to work @entity50 remained seated in the dugout the entire 90 minutes , while @entity49 stood at the edge of his technical area			1
@entity66 has had a hand in seven goals in six @entity1 appearances			0
his cross for @entity13 ’s goal last night was his fourth assist since joining , to go alongside three goals			0
@entity66 was once again a threat for @entity20 , adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far @entity75 was named in a @entity20 starting line - up for the first time in the @entity1 this season and gave us a look at his new all - white boots			1
it looked as if he was playing in socks such was the colour and fabric of the boot , known as ‘ superheat soccer cleats ’ made by warrior			0
@entity75 's white ' superheat soccer cleats ' attracted plenty of attention during the game at the @entity93 the young winger was making his first @entity1 under @entity50 in the new boots			1

@entity0 had lost his previous four @entity1 games
@entity50 changes formation again but @entity20 struggle
@entity7 boss @entity49 sticks with *successful* tactics to earn draw
