@entity1 airstrikes against the little known @entity3 terror group have failed to stop ' imminent ' attacks on @entity6 targets because key members scattered amid news reports of their existence			1
many of the @entity12 - affiliated terrorists are believed to have fled their bases near the @entity15 city of @entity16 several days before the strikes , taking with them the dangerous explosives with which they are said to be plotting to blow up planes over @entity20 and the @entity1			1
as a result , the bombing raid managed to kill ' only one or two ' key figures , with the remaining 1,000 @entity3 members continuing plans to attack the @entity27 , according to @entity1 intelligence officials			1
the existence of the @entity3 group only emerged in the weeks before the september 22 @entity1 air force bombing raid , which took place on the same night as a coalition of @entity1 and @entity35 warplanes carried out their first strikes on @entity38 targets inside @entity15			1
among the @entity3 fighters who survived the airstrikes is a @entity59 - born jihadist who fought in @entity60 and has a military prowess that is of great concern to @entity1 intelligence officials			1
one of the @entity1 missiles went awry and killed a dozen civilians in the village of @entity67 , according to @entity68 , an activist in the northern province of @entity70			1
the @entity1 military says it has not confirmed any civilian casualties			1
the failure of the attack on @entity3 is partly the result of a hazy intelligence picture that also has bedeviled the air campaign against @entity38 targets in @entity15 and @entity79			0
the @entity1 lacks the networks of bases , spies and ground - based technology it had in place during the height of the wars in @entity79 and @entity60 , officials say , or even the network of human sources it developed in @entity90 and @entity91			1
' the strikes were certainly effective in setting back the @entity50 , but no one thinks they were a permanent solution or a death blow to the threats that come from this cell , ' said @entity99 representative @entity98 , who serves on the @entity100			0
bombed : the targets of the strikes were fighters from the @entity50 , which is how the @entity1 government refers to a cell led by @entity12 veterans who had relocated to @entity15 from @entity60 - @entity90 failed : @entity108 he existence of the @entity3 group only emerged in the weeks before the september 22 @entity1 air force bombing raid , which took place on the same night as a coalition of @entity1 and @entity35 warplanes carried out their first strikes on @entity38 targets inside @entity15			1
damage : one of the @entity1 missiles went awry and killed a dozen civilians in the village of @entity67 ( pictured ) , according to @entity68 , an activist in the north @entity15 province of @entity70 the existence of @entity3 became public only weeks before the airstrikes , prompting a flurry of news reports , but @entity1 officials claim to have been tracking the militants for up to two years			1
officials said that among the group 's top brass are a few dozen @entity12 members , some of whom are long - sought militants connected to the fighting in @entity60 and @entity90 over the last decade			1
@entity3 is said to be working closely with @entity133 - a terror group that has acted as @entity12 official presence in @entity15 during the ongoing civil war that has ravaged the country of the past three years			1
the details were provided by several current and former @entity1 officials spoke on condition of anonymity about the group because they were not authorized to discuss classified information			1
in public , @entity1 officials have offered seemingly contradictory assessments of the attacks on the @entity141			2
general @entity146 , chairman of the @entity147 , said the strikes disrupted the group 's plotting , but he did not know for how long			0
fbi director @entity151 said he believed the plots had not been disrupted and that the group remains a threat to the @entity1 other intelligence officials embraced @entity151 's view			2
launch : on september 22 , the @entity1 fired 46 cruise missiles at eight locations linked to the @entity161 group , although their limited effectiveness has now been fully revealed one @entity3 leader , @entity163 ( pictured ) , has been eulogized as a ' martyr ' on jihadi websites			2
but @entity1 officials are not convinced he is dead and fear the claims are a front to turn attention away from him terrorist group @entity171 may be considering using @entity172 as a suicide bio-weapon against the @entity27 , according to a military expert			2
the virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person who is showing the symptoms – and it would n't be difficult for fanatics to contract it then travel to countries they want to wreak havoc in , according to a military expert			0
captain @entity184 a professor of national security affairs at the @entity186 , said that the strategy is entirely plausible			0
he told @entity188 : ' the individual exposed to the @entity172 would be the carrier			0
in the context of terrorist activity , it does n't take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier			0
' and professor @entity198 , director at @entity200 's @entity199 , agrees that the strategy might be considered			0
he said : ' in some ways it 's a plausible theory – is fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission			0
' ' they are sufficiently murderous and well - informed to consider it , and they know that we 've been remiss in the @entity213 , ' he added			0
@entity3 is a historical reference to a region that included parts of @entity217 and @entity60			0
unlike the @entity133 , which is trying to topple @entity15 president @entity219 , the @entity50 is focused chiefly on carrying out an attack against the @entity27 , officials say			0
the group is said to have been trying to recruit @entity20 and @entity1 whose passports allow them to board a @entity1 - bound airliner with less scrutiny			1
in addition , according to classified @entity1 intelligence assessments , the @entity3 militants have been trying to make or obtain explosives that can be slipped past airport security			2
among their sources , officials said , has been @entity12 's affiliate in @entity91 , which has put bombs on airplanes , though the bombs failed to explode			2
the fear is that the @entity3 militants will provide these sophisticated explosives to their @entity6 recruits who could sneak them onto @entity1 - bound flights			1
one @entity3 leader , @entity163 , has been eulogized on jihadi websites , but @entity1 officials are not convinced that he is dead			2
they said they believe another senior militant was killed , but have declined to name him			0
a second @entity3 figure , a @entity59 militant named @entity247 , is believed to be alive			0
@entity247 , who was born in the @entity250 region and converted to @entity251 as a youth , spent time with @entity12 in the tribal areas of @entity90 before traveling to @entity15 , @entity59 officials say			0
he was identified as a member of the @entity50 by two @entity1 officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information .			0
