millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the @entity1 if @entity3 researchers win approval to use the bugs against two extremely painful viral diseases			1
but the move , if it goes ahead , would be unprecedented as modified dna insects have never been so close to being set loose in a residential @entity11 neighborhood before			1
' this is essentially using a mosquito as a drug to cure disease , ' said @entity16 , executive director of the @entity17 , which is waiting to hear if the @entity18 will allow the experiment			1
@entity21 , an entomological technician with the @entity17 , sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes under a microscope in @entity24 , @entity1 dengue and chikungunya are growing threats in the @entity11 , but some people are more frightened at the thought of being bitten by a genetically modified organism			1
more than 130,000 signed a @entity32 petition against the experiment			1
even potential boosters say those responsible must do more to show that benefits outweigh the risks			1
' i think the science is fine , they definitely can kill mosquitoes , but the @entity41 issue still sticks as something of a thorny issue for the general public , ' said @entity45 , who studies mosquito control at the @entity1 @entity47			1
' it 's not even so much about the science — you ca n't go ahead with something like this if public opinion is negative			1
' mosquito controllers say they 're running out of options that can kill @entity55 , a tiger - striped invader whose biting females spread these viruses			1
climate change and globalization are spreading tropical diseases farther from the equator , and @entity24 , the southernmost @entity11 city , is particularly vulnerable			1
' an arriving person would be infectious for several days , and could infect many of the local mosquitoes , ' @entity16 said			1
' within a few weeks you 'd likely end up with several infected mosquitoes for each infected visitor			2
' there are no vaccines or cures for dengue , known as ' break - bone fever , ' or chikungunya , which causes painful contortions			1
@entity11 cases remain rare for now , but dengue sickens 50 million people annually worldwide and kills 2.5 percent of the half - million who get severe cases , according to the @entity79			1
@entity80 has already overwhelmed hospitals and harmed economies across the @entity83 after infecting a million people in the region last year			2
@entity86 , a field inspector with the @entity17 , tests a sprayer that could be used in the future to spray pesticides to control mosquitos in @entity24 an aedes aegypti mosquito feeds on the arm of @entity94 , the @entity95 supervisor for the @entity17 , in @entity96 , @entity1 , they could soon be used to test and treat disease @entity99 , an entomological technician with the @entity17 , sorts and counts dead captured mosquitoes millions of genetically modified mosquitoes could be released in the @entity1 insecticides are sprayed year - round from helicopters and door - to - door in charming and crowded neighborhoods throughout the @entity95			1
but because @entity107 aegypti do n't travel much and are repeatedly doused with the same chemicals , they have evolved to resist four of the six insecticides used to kill them			2
enter @entity112 , a @entity3 biotech firm launched by @entity114 researchers			2
they patented a method of breeding @entity55 with fragments of proteins from the herpes simplex virus and e. coli bacteria as well as genes from coral and cabbage			2
this synthetic dna has been used in thousands of experiments without harming lab animals , but it is fatal to the bugs , killing mosquito larvae before they can fly or bite			2
@entity112 's lab workers manually remove modified females , aiming to release only males , which feed on nectar and do n't bite for blood like females do			2
the modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die , reducing the population			2
@entity112 has built a breeding lab in @entity143 and hopes to release its mosquitoes this spring in @entity145 , a neighborhood of 444 homes closely clustered on a relatively isolated peninsula at the north end of @entity24			2
@entity18 spokeswoman @entity149 said no field tests will be allowed until the agency has ' thoroughly reviewed all the necessary information			2
' @entity155 spokeswoman @entity153 said the test will be similar in size to @entity112 's 2012 experiment in the @entity159 , where 3.3 million modified mosquitoes were released over six months , suppressing 96 percent of the targeted bugs			1
this undated photo made available by @entity112 shows a genetically modified @entity55 mosquito in their @entity3 lab @entity112 says a later test in @entity166 also was successful , and both countries now want larger - scale projects			0
but critics accused @entity112 of failing to obtain informed consent in the @entity159 , saying residents were n't told they could be bitten by a few stray females overlooked in the lab. instead , @entity112 said only non-biting males would be released , and that even if humans were somehow bitten , no genetically modified @entity124 would enter their bloodstream			1
neither claim is entirely true , outside observers say			0
' what @entity112 is trying to spin is that it 's highly improbable that there will be negative consequences of this foreign dna entering someone that 's bitten by an @entity112 mosquito , ' said @entity45			0
' i 'm on their side , in that consequences are highly unlikely			0
but to say that there 's no genetically modified dna that might get into a human , that 's kind of a gray matter			0
' asked about these points , @entity153 says @entity112 has now released 70 million of its mosquitoes in several countries and received no reports of human impacts caused by bites or from the synthetic dna , despite regulatory oversight that encourages people to report any problems			1
' we are confident of the safety of our mosquito , as there 's no mechanism for any adverse effect on human health			0
the proteins are non-toxic and non-allergenic , ' she said			0
@entity112 should still do more to show that the synthetic dna causes no harm when transferred into humans by its mosquitoes , said @entity215 , a molecular geneticist at @entity217 's @entity216			0
to build trust in any cutting - edge science , a range of independent experts — not just the company that stands to gain or the regulatory agency involved — should have enough access to data published in peer - reviewed journals to be able to explain the specific benefits and risks , he said			0
' failing to do this almost inevitably means a potential for controversy to be sustained and amplified , ' said @entity215 , adding that mosquito - borne diseases need more solutions			0
' we should not be closing down productive avenues , and genetically modified mosquitoes might be one of them			0
' with the @entity18 watching , @entity16 and @entity112 's product development manager , @entity240 , checked their frustration at public meetings in november and december , repeatedly fielding the same questions from the same critics			0
their selling points : this experiment is self - limiting , using insects engineered to kill their progeny , not make them stronger			1
it is contained , since @entity112 's mosquitoes wo n't breed with other species			0
killing off aedes aegypti can protect human health while eliminating an invasive species			0
and most @entity145 residents responded positively to a district survey about the planned field test			0
using gmos also could save money : the district spends 10 percent of its budget on @entity55 , which represents less than 1 percent of the 45 mosquito species buzzing around the @entity95			0
@entity145 resident @entity266 still was n't persuaded			0
the @entity95 have n't experienced a dengue outbreak in years , and no chikungunya cases have been reported here , she said			1
' if i knew that this was a real risk and lives could be saved , that would make sense , ' @entity266 said			0
' but there are no problems			0
why are we trying to fix it ? why are we being used as the experiment , the guinea pigs , just to see what happens ? ' if the @entity18 decides against the test , or the modified mosquitoes fail to work as promised , @entity16 will still need to kill the bugs			1
' i 'm convinced the only way to fight this is using the mosquitoes to fight each other , ' he said .			0

poised to be the first time @entity41 insects are released in @entity11 residential area
@entity294 and chikungunya are growing threats in the @entity11
