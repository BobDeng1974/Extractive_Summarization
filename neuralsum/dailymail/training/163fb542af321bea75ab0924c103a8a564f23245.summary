under half : corporations are paying far less income tax as a percentage than the statutory rate of 35 per cent , shown in graph of 2008 totals sliding : the 2009 graph shows how corporations started paying less tax , with the industrial machinery industry hitting negatives minimal input : four major industries paid less than 10 per cent tax in 2010 @entity33 , a @entity34 - area power company , had the lowest effective tax rate , at negative 57.6 per cent , among the 280 @entity10 companies studied			1
the statutory @entity3 corporate income tax rate is 35 per cent , one of the highest in the world ; but over the 2008 - 2010 period , very few of the companies studied paid it , said the report			1
the average effective tax rate for the companies over the period was 18.5 per cent , said @entity14 and the @entity15 , both think tanks			1
their report also listed @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 as among the 30 that paid no taxes			0
corporations will say rightly that the loopholes that let them slash their taxes were perfectly legal , the report said			0
' but that does not mean that low - tax corporations bear no responsibility			2
the laws were not enacted in a vacuum ; they were adopted in response to relentless corporate lobbying , threats and campaign support , ' the report said			0
some of the 30 companies disputed the report 's findings			0

' @entity53 paid its taxes ' between 2008 - 2010 ... our effective income tax rate was 26.5 percent , 22.9 percent , 33.6 percent in 2010 , 2009 , 2008 , ' said a spokesman for the aerospace group			1
as @entity16 and the @entity119 administration struggle with a sluggish economy and high deficits , corporations are pressing @entity122 for more tax breaks and a lower corporate rate			1
taxes are on the agenda of the congressional ' super committee ' tasked with finding at least $ 1.2 trillion in additional budget savings by november 23 , but it is so far deadlocked across a familiar divide - republicans refusing any tax increases , @entity134 defending social programs			2
on tuesday , a panel of budget experts warned super committee members they would fail the country if they did not meet their goal			0
financial markets have been waiting for many months for signs that @entity34 can get its financial house in order , but few have been forthcoming			0
the report referred back to the 1986 tax reform pushed through by president @entity147 , a @entity148 , who approved the largest corporate tax increase in @entity3 history , largely by ending tax breaks , while cutting individual tax rates			1
tax - dodge ? @entity93 tops the list of 280 @entity3 corporations receiving the most in tax subsidies , getting nearly $ 18 billion in tax breaks from the @entity3 treasury in the last three years ' @entity147 solved the problem by sweeping away corporate tax loopholes , ' said the report , which was coauthored by @entity14 chief @entity160			1
his research 25 years ago played a key role in convincing mr @entity147 reform was needed			0
the industrial machinery business enjoyed the lowest effective tax rate during the study period , while the highest rate was paid by healthcare companies , the report said			1
' @entity170 is getting away with taxation murder , ' said @entity172 , vice chairman of the @entity173 , a progressive business coalition			0
' they pay little or no taxes on massive @entity3 profits and then have the gall to lobby for a tax holiday to ' repatriate ' profits they have stashed offshore			2
' what are some of the tax breaks that corporations enjoy ? one big one is accelerated depreciation that lets them write off equipment faster than it actually wears out			2
deductions on executive stock options help			0
so do tax breaks for research and development and for making products in the @entity3 instead of overseas			1
offshore tax shelters play a role , too			0
power group @entity85 was one of the 30 companies listed as paying no income taxes in 2008 - 2010			2
big profits : @entity203 was another top tax subsidy recipient with $ 14.5 billion chief executive @entity205 told @entity206 that @entity85 cut its taxes thanks to accelerated depreciation , which he said helped the company build new plants and hire construction workers			2
@entity205 is a frequent spokesman for a coalition of large multinationals seeking a tax break that would let them bring foreign profits into the @entity3 at a reduced tax rate			1
others among the 30 companies included power producer @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , chemicals company @entity86 and toymaker @entity95 like @entity85 , @entity81 said it benefited from accelerated depreciation			0
a @entity95 spokesperson said the report 's claims were inconsistent with the company 's public financial filings			0
' @entity86 complies with all tax laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which it operates , ' said a @entity86 spokeswoman			0
the average effective corporate tax rate , as calculated by @entity233 's group , was about 14 percent before the @entity147 reforms ; afterward it shot up to 26.5 percent in 1988			1
as companies found their way around the reforms , the effective rate fell back to about 17 percent by 2002 - 2003			2
unlike in @entity147 's time , taming corporate tax breaks alone will not solve the deficit problem			2
such breaks cost the government about $ 102 billion in lost revenues in 2011 , a year when the federal deficit was an estimated $ 1.3 trillion			0
corporate loopholes are dwarfed by tax breaks that benefit individuals , such as the mortgage interest tax deduction -- a middle class sacred cow , on its own worth $ 104 billion			1
still , said the report : ' if we are going to get our nation 's fiscal house in order , increasing corporate income taxes should play an important role			0

average tax rate for 280 companies in study was 18.5 percent - less than half the statutory rate of 35 per cent
total tax subsidies given to all corporations in report amounted to $ 222.7 billion from 2008 to 2010
@entity93 tops the list , getting nearly $ 18 billion in tax breaks from the @entity3 treasury over the last three years
