astronomers believe the @entity2 spacecraft has spotted @entity4 ’s rings giving birth to a new moon			2
named ‘ @entity8 ’ , the baby moon sits on the very edge of @entity4 's a ring - the outermost of the planet 's large , bright rings			1
it was first discovered exactly one year ago by professor @entity15 of @entity16 and was named after his mother - in - law			1
the thin , outermost ring shown in this picture from the @entity2 probe is @entity4 's f ring , and the bright dot near it is the @entity24			2
the thicker white band is the a ring			0
the smudge in the red circle near what looks like the tip of that ring was created by @entity8 in a chance discovery , professor @entity15 spotted disturbances on the a ring , with one showing an arc that was 20 per cent brighter than its surroundings			1
the arc , which is 750 miles ( 1,200 km ) long and 6 miles ( 10 km ) wide , is thought to have been created by the gravitational effects of the new moon			0
at present , the scientists estimate @entity8 is probably no more than around half a mile ( 0.8 km ) in diameter			1
published in the journal @entity46 , the researchers predict the new moon will remain the same size , and may even be falling apart @entity4 is known to have of 53 natural with two orbiting within gaps in the main rings			0
on @entity4 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity52 years , meaning @entity2 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity4 year launched in 1997 , @entity2 has been exploring @entity4 and its series of moons since 2004			0
on @entity4 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity52 years , meaning @entity2 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity4 year			0
since 2004 , @entity4 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity2 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004 , also observing @entity62 , the heliosphere , and testing the theory of relativity @entity2 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity4 and the first to enter orbit , and its mission is on going as of 2013			0
but the process of its formation and outward movement helps in the understanding of how @entity4 's icy moons formed			1
‘ we have not seen anything like this before , ’ said @entity15 of @entity16 , and the report 's lead author			0
‘ we may be looking at the act of birth , where this object is just leaving the rings and heading off to be a moon in its own right			0
’ @entity8 could help explain how the cloud - wrapped @entity85 and ocean - holding @entity86 , may have formed in more massive rings long ago			2
it also provides insight into how @entity52 and other planets in our solar system may have formed and migrated away from the sun. @entity4 's icy moons range in size depending on their proximity to the planet - the farther from the planet , the larger			1
and many of @entity4 's moons are comprised primarily of ice , as are the particles that form @entity4 's rings			1
based on these facts , and other indicators , researchers recently proposed that the icy moons formed from ring particles and then moved outward , away from the planet , merging with other moons on the way			2
last year , hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of @entity4 's rings			1
from left to right in the top row , the trails in these images are 18 , 85 and 96 miles long			0
in the bottom row from left to right , the trails are 43 , 129 and 32 miles long @entity4 's icy moons range in size depending on their proximity to the planet - the farther from the planet , the larger			1

‘ witnessing the possible birth of a tiny moon is an exciting , unexpected event , ’ said @entity134 scientist @entity133 , of @entity136 ’s @entity135			0
according to ms @entity133 , @entity2 's orbit will move closer to the outer edge of the @entity142 in late 2016 and provide an opportunity to study @entity8 in more detail and perhaps even image it			0
it is possible the process of moon formation in @entity4 's rings has ended with @entity8 , as @entity4 's rings now are , in all likelihood , too depleted to make more moons			1
because they may not observe this process again , professor @entity15 and his colleagues are trying to learn all they can from these observations			0
‘ the theory holds that @entity4 long ago had a much more massive ring system capable of giving birth to larger moons , ’ professor @entity15 said			1
‘ as the moons formed near the edge , they depleted the rings and evolved , so the ones that formed earliest are the largest and the farthest out			2
’ last year , hundreds of objects up to half a mile in diameter were caught on camera wreaking havoc with one of @entity4 ’s rings			2
the objects were actually snowballs created by some of @entity4 ’s 60 moons , like @entity174			0
at the time of the discovery , professor @entity15 said , ‘ i think the f ring is @entity4 's weirdest ring , and these latest @entity2 results go to show how the f ring is even more dynamic than we ever thought			1
