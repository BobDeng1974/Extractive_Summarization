a wrong turning gave a bus full of western journalists a glimpse of a different side to @entity5 today			1
most foreign visitors to @entity7 on the @entity9 heartland never witness a pothole , a traffic jam or a piece of litter bigger than a cigarette butt			1
those with physical disabilities are hidden from view as is graffiti			2
buses catering for people outside of @entity5 only ever take roads which are well - maintained and spotlessly clean which is why photographers could n’t wait to start snapping away when a government - run tour inadvertently veered from the official path			1
towering : a large modern apartment block in @entity7 , @entity5 , which the regime is happy for foreigners to see hidden from view : @entity34 crumbling buildings inhabited by @entity5 residents in the capital city mingle on the side of the street in @entity7 instead of gleaming buildings such as the computer labs at @entity40 , filled with people whom the authorities insist are representative of the population , reporters saw crumbling apartment blocks and two men in wheelchairs waiting at a bus stop			1
old people trudged along the sidewalk , some with handmade backpacks crafted from canvas bags			2
in place of the well - lit high - rise homes , there were shops shrouded in darkness and pavements lined in dirt rather than smooth tarmac			2
there were stores with no lights , and side roads so battered they were more dirt than pavement			0
' perhaps this is an incorrect road ? ' mumbled one of the @entity5 minders , well - dressed government officials who restrict reporters to meticulously staged presentations that inevitably center on praise for the three generations of @entity77 family who have ruled this country since 1948			1
@entity34 : a @entity5 man pushes a wheelbarrow past a pile of coal in @entity7 manual labour : @entity85 close to the water on an industrial site			1
the images depict a world that @entity5 officials try and hide the three buses quickly reversed away from the less wealthy area of the city and headed back towards the original intended target , a plush , marbled building called the @entity97 where recently deceased leader @entity98 made one of his final public appearances before his death in december last year			1
@entity103 news reported that @entity104 , who was leading the tour , said : ‘ i hope that the journalists present here report only the absolute truth			2
how life really is : poor @entity5 living in a run - down concrete residential compound in @entity7 , @entity5 the @entity5 they want you to see : @entity40 students swim inside a modern gleaming swimming pool complex at @entity40 plush : @entity5 relax in a smart new jacuzzi at @entity40 - but the reality is very different to the life of most people modern : university students stand on a platform at the swimming pool before going down a slide ' the truth about how much our people miss our comrade @entity98 , and how strong the unity is between the people and leadership , who are vigorously carrying out the leaders ' instructions to build a great , prosperous and powerful nation			1
’ so controlling is the regime that police will detain and potentially expel any foreigner who tries to explore further afield than the few hotels that they are permitted to stay in			0
according to @entity140 , a professor at @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity143 , those in charge will go to huge lengths to create a system that will keep the @entity77 family in power			0
" they 've managed to create a process of control that works , " he said			0
gloom : a woman carries a baby on her back as she walks through an area of the @entity5 city which resembles @entity156 real life for @entity5 : two men stood by a concrete wall look up at a plane flying overhead yesterday			1
to many @entity5 these pictures likely depict a very middle class life as conditions in the countryside are far grimmer rundown highrise : a residential tower block seen in @entity7 yesterday as a bus full of journalists took a wrong turn into an area that is normally hidden from them what they want you to see : thousands of people gather for the unveiling of statues of the @entity5 leaders , @entity179 , and his son @entity98 , during an unveiling ceremony in @entity7 bizarre : cartoon characters decorate the outside of the @entity185 duck factory which employs 1,000 workers and produces 7,000 tons of duck products a year in @entity7 at @entity40 students young people in the swimming pool were seen enjoying the luxurious , well - finished surroundings that feature plastic slides and a jacuzzi			1
journalists normally see only the clean streets outside their bus windows , and the showcase buildings - the @entity198 , the palace commemorating the @entity201 ' ' juche ' philosophy of self - reliance , the computer labs at @entity40 - filled with people that the minders insist are everyday @entity5			1
the students in the classrooms do n't glance up as dozens of reporters rumble in , and the professor 's lecture continues without pause			0
the young people in the university pool careen down the plastic slide , in front of tv cameras , as if they are completely alone			0
@entity104 heaps high praise on her former leader			0
she says : ‘ the more time passes by the more we miss our dear leader @entity98 ‘ i do n't think we can ever find any person so great			0
’ dilapidated old travel car : @entity5 commuters pass by in a trolley car in @entity7 - in a far cry from the modern image of the country the regime want to present @entity231 : a @entity5 woman cleans ducks on a processing line at the @entity185 duck factory it 's not clear why the regime hides places like the dusty , potholed neighborhood , which is just a mile or so from the centre of town , across the trolley tracks and just off @entity243			1
it does n't look like a war zone , or even like a particularly rough @entity247 neighborhood			0
many streets in @entity249 , the capital of one of the world 's fastest - growing economies , look far more battered and far poorer			0
to most @entity5 , one - quarter of whom depend on international food aid , living in homes without electricity or running water , the neighborhood would look upper - middle - class			1
special permits are required to live in the capital city , and life here is vastly better than it is for most people in the countryside			0
there are predictable government jobs here , electricity at least a few hours a day , better - stocked stores , schools that have indoor bathrooms			0
but the officials still hide the run - down neighborhoods			0
there 's a certain view of @entity5 they want visitors to have			1
urban living : a schoolgirl walks under a bridge in front of residential tower blocks			2
although the accommodation would n't look out of place in a @entity287 city like @entity247 , the regime are not keen to show it off modern ... or technology out of the 1970s ? @entity290 show off their scientific prowess ahead of their satellite launch - which flopped within seconds according to defectors @entity5 have similar stresses to those living in capitalist societies			2
they get frustrated by politics in their jobs , they aspire to buy their own cars and look forward to a holiday at the beach			0
in times of difficulty such as the famine in the 1990s , they dream of having enough food to prevent their children from starving to death			0
yet the more rundown area the journalists were accidentally driven into today would appear plush to many @entity5 who depend on international food aid and live in homes without electricity or running water			1
special permits are required to live in the capital city , and life there is considerably easier than it is for the majority of people living in the countryside			0
there are predictable government jobs in @entity7 , electricity for at least a few hours a day , better - stocked stores and schools that have indoor bathrooms			2
urban life : @entity5 workers , left , repair a street in the city yesterday as a man rides past on a bicycle workers : flowers are laid in a street as the country prepares for national celebrations			2

most foreign visitors to @entity7 on the *communist* @entity5 never witness a pothole or a traffic jam
journalists saw crumbling apartment blocks and two men in wheelchairs waiting at a bus stop
