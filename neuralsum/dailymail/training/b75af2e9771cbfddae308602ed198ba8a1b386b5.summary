by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 10:58 est , 15 january 2014 a single mother who comfort ate when her confidence ' hit rock bottom ' after she had a baby has turned her life around and dropped four dress sizes			1
at 5ft 3in tall , @entity9 , 30 , from @entity10 , had always been a petite size 10			1
but after she had her son six years ago , she suffered from post-natal depression			1
as a single mother caring for her baby , she began to feel isolated and alone and her unhappiness led to her comfort eating and neglecting her appearance			1
used to hide under baggy clothes : @entity9 gained three - and - a - half - stone after becoming a mother , left , but is now feeling confident again after slimming to a dress size 12 , right she did n't have time to cook so she would often skip breakfast and lunch and snack on unhealthy treats of crisps and chocolate instead , and then have a takeaway for dinner			1
she said : ' before my son was born i was a size 10 and had lots of confidence and friends , but after having my son i piled on the weight and my confidence hit rock bottom			1
' i always ate at the wrong times and i never had three meals a day because i 'd be eating rubbish through the day and night and never felt full			1
i hated the way i looked and had no belief in myself			2
i could n't even look in the mirror			2
' @entity9 's weight increased to 13st 7lbs , dress size 20 , and she wore baggy clothes to try and conceal her fuller figure			1
as her son grew older and became more active , her larger size meant she struggled to play with him which made her feel even worse about herself			2
' i could n't keep up with my son , he always wanted to run around , but after half an hour i was done and left feeling bad that i had disappointed him by not playing longer , ' she explained			2
her weight gain also meant she did n't have the confidence to go on dates and she became more withdrawn and unsociable			0
flabby to fit : the single mother plucked up the courage to start exercising - and found it gave her more energy , left , so she 's now lost 3st , right she said : ' i tried to hide my feelings from my family and friends , but they all knew that over the years i had changed			1
i no longer dressed well and hid my body in comfy , loose tracksuits , hoping to go unnoticed			0
' i hated shopping - none of the fancy shops ever had my size , so i mainly always wore tracksuits			1
but i could n't hide from my family , my sister and i are very close and she knew how unhappy i really was			2
' @entity9 's family encouraged her to go on a diet but she said : ' i tried loads of diets over the years but nothing worked			1
it 's not like i did n't want to try and lose the weight , it 's just they did n't work			0
each time i tried and failed i felt more miserable			0
' she added that she also felt exercise was unachievable			0
she said : ' it was a vicious circle			0
i had no energy to exercise and so my weight carried on going up and my energy levels plummeted			0
i felt drained all the time			0
' active : her weight increased after she had her son and she wanted to slim down so she had more energy to play with him @entity9 then tried the @entity94 and found their 90 day diet and fitness plan was one she could finally stick to			1
she set her target weight at 10st - what she had weighed before becoming a mother - and has almost achieved that target as she now weighs @entity101 , a dress size 12			1
now she 's 3st lighter , she said she feels like her former self again			2
after taking up exercise , she now has more energy for motherhood and has re-gained the confidence to get back on the dating scene			0
she said : ' i 'm so happy			0
i look much better and i 'm full of energy so now not only can i go up the stairs without losing my breath , but i 'm actually going to the gym too			0
something i never thought was possible			0
i 'm like a new women , i 've lost weight and gained back my confidence i 'm even considering dating again			1
' i 'm now able to take my son to the park and chase around after him now , we can go on walks or i 'll walk along with him whilst he 's on his bike			0
i bought a dress two years ago and i could never get it over my shoulders , but at @entity124 i put it on and my son said that i looked like an angel , i could n't stop smiling			2
