by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 and his girlfriend @entity4 had a ' loving and caring ' relationship , his manager told the @entity8 athlete 's murder trial today			1
@entity9 said @entity3 and his model girlfriend called each other pet names and the athlete was making plans to take her away on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her			2
the defence called mr @entity9 to the stand in an attempt to bolster @entity3 ' account that he mistook @entity4 for an intruder , providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door			1
giving evidence at the trial , mr @entity9 told the court the athlete was nervous and ' fidgety ' at home and had a ' heightened sense of awareness			1
' mr @entity9 recalled to the court how on one occasion @entity3 drove at high speed to the airport and , when told there was no rush , recalled a traumatic episode in which mr @entity9 was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007			2
' he wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed , ' mr @entity9 said			0
he also remembered a time when @entity3 grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in @entity69 , and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under ' abusive questioning ' from journalists			0
he also said he was assisting @entity3 in plans to take @entity4 , a 29 - year - old model , to races in @entity78 and @entity79 , and a concert in @entity81			2
@entity3 has testified that he fired through a closed bathroom door , killing @entity4 , in the mistaken belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home chief prosecutor @entity87 tried to pick holes in @entity9 's testimony , pressing the agent for details about a reported incident in which a @entity94 athlete who was sharing a room with @entity3 asked for them to be separated because @entity3 was allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone			1
he also referred to a 2012 @entity99 race in which @entity3 accused the winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too long			0
@entity9 acknowledged that it was the ' wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a way ' but noted there was a ' long lead - up ' to the incident in which @entity3 had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted			0
mr @entity87 also described @entity3 ' plans to take @entity4 on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after @entity9 quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend ' to see what my world is about , the pressure that i 'm under ' and ' how i need to perform			1
' earlier , the hearing focused on the screams that neighbours say they heard on the night the athlete killed his girlfriend			2
june @entity4 , mother of @entity4 , arrives at @entity35 for the trial of @entity3 chief prosecutor @entity87 ( pictured ) today cross-examined acoustics expert @entity125 , who gave evidence yesterday about the challenges of hearing accurately from a distance mr @entity87 questioned an acoustics expert who was called by the defence team as part of its effort to suggest some neighbours who testified they heard the screams of a woman were wrong			1
they argue the witnesses actually heard the high - pitched screams of the double - amputee runner			0
the acoustics expert , @entity125 , testified that he conducted tests that showed ambient noise and other factors can make it difficult to hear accurately from a distance			0
mr @entity125 questioned whether neighbours 177 metres away could have heard screams coming from the toilet , or identified them as a man or woman			1
‘ at 177 metres away , if the scream was from the toilet , it is highly unlikely that the listener can hear the screams , let alone interpret the sound source reliably , ’ he said			0
@entity3 faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder , and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing mr @entity87 said the screams of a woman have a ' tonal character ' and referred to the testimony of the neighbours who were convinced they had heard a screaming woman			1
mr @entity125 responded that he could not say whether they were ' correct or incorrect '			1
@entity3 has testified that he fired through a closed bathroom door , killing @entity4 , in the mistaken belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home			2
the prosecution has alleged that @entity3 , 27 , killed 29 - year - old @entity4 after a @entity180 argument			0
@entity3 faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder , and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing			0
