by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 2 november 2012 an illegal file - sharer has been fined a record $ 1.5million for pirating ten gay porn films online			1
@entity3 must pay damages of $ 150,000 per film to adult entertainment company @entity6 , a federal court in @entity8 ruled this week			1
the fine is thought to be the largest ever awarded in a file - sharing case , in part because mr @entity3 failed to show up in court or offer a defence			1
fine : @entity3 must pay damages of $ 1.5million to adult entertainment company @entity6 for illegally sharing ten gay porn films online ( file picture ) he shared each film online for others to download using @entity19 , @entity16 told the hearing			1
the leaks were traced back to his computer using an individual encryption code inserted in the dvds he originally bought as pay - per - view items directly from @entity16			2
after mr @entity3 shared the films , they were downloaded or viewed 3,449 times			1
he was found to have violated the terms of @entity16 's pay - per - view service and then displayed ' wilful copyright infringement ' by sharing the films			2
mr @entity3 was one of 15 people that @entity16 took legal action against for pirating its movies , reports the @entity36			1
however , his case was the only one to reach court after the others were dropped for lack of evidence			2
it is unclear whether he will appeal the ruling or can afford to pay the fine			2
a study published in september found that people who use file - sharing programs to download films and music from the @entity50 are likely to have had their computer 's virtual address logged			0
computer scientists at the @entity54 monitored what is perhaps the largest file sharing site , @entity57 , over the last three years			0
the team discovered that the most popular files on the site , often illegal copies of hit tv shows or films , were monitored by , on average , three secretive parties - including copyright enforcement agencies , security companies and even government research labs			0
the monitors are believed to be logging the ip address of the user - potentially identifying where the file is downloaded to			0
however , for anyone now worried about a knock at the door , the researchers say it is unlikely the evidence gathered would be sufficient to lead to court proceedings			0
when a user chooses to download a file , the users join a ' swarm ' of other users who are either downloading the file , of have successfully received it			0
but by downloading a file , the user 's ip address is available to other members of the swarm , and the @entity54 team found monitors actively grabbing this information .			0
