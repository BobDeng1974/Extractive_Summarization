while the rest of @entity2 keeps its toes dry , elevated and toasty by the nearest fire place , the football season goes on in the @entity5 with the traditional @entity7 fixtures			2
it 's the start of a typically and traditionally packed fixture list for teams up and down the land but it is also a time for @entity14 crackers as @entity15 looks at the finest top flight clashes from december 26 over the years			1
@entity17 wednesday 3 - 3 @entity18 , 1992 it was n’t just at @entity20 where @entity21 could implode while leading against @entity18 ( see 1993 ) – they could do it at @entity24 too			2
@entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 had the @entity29 cruising just after the hour mark , before @entity31 scored twice in 13 minutes to set up a tense finale for the final 10			0
a combination of comical wednesday defending and fine attacking instinct ensured @entity18 an equaliser with six minutes left , as former wednesday trialist @entity36 bundled home from close range			0
arguably the first of many amazing @entity18 comebacks in the @entity5 era			0
@entity41 2 - 2 @entity42 , 2008 this @entity44 clash was crucial at the top of the table with @entity42 having eyes on the league title , while @entity41 were well in the hunt for @entity51 football			1
the @entity52 took control with goals before and after half - time from @entity56 and @entity57 but @entity59 ’s side were far from finished			0
@entity60 netted a 65th minute penalty following @entity63 ’s foul on @entity64 , before @entity65 clinched a dramatic draw after turning home @entity69 ’s cross in stoppage time			0
@entity60 fires home a 65th minute penalty to send @entity41 on their way to a 2 - 2 draw against @entity42 @entity65 clinched a dramatic draw after turning home @entity69 ’s cross in stoppage time 8			1
@entity77 5 - 1 @entity78 , 2008 while @entity41 were rescuing draws against @entity42 , @entity78 boss @entity79 was busy giving one of the more unorthodox team - talks seen in recent times			1
with the @entity86 4 - 0 down at @entity77 thanks to doubles from @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity79 held a three - minute team - talk at the break in front of the @entity78 supporters as he publicly gave his team a verbal lashing at the @entity93			2
it brought his team a consolation strike in the second half through @entity97 , only for @entity98 to restore @entity77 ’s four - goal advantage just two minutes later in the 82nd minute			0
@entity79 berates his @entity78 team during at half - time after they went 4 - 0 down by half - time 7			2
@entity103 4 - 3 @entity104 , 2002 it was the year in which defensive coaches were given @entity14 off at @entity103 and @entity104 with this game seeing three goals inside the first 10 minutes , with an @entity111 equaliser sandwiched between @entity112 and @entity114 goals for @entity103			1
the real shock here though was n’t that @entity103 would go on to win just their second home game of the season , but that @entity119 ( post @entity121 debut ) would find the back of the net twice in the victory			0
his final league goals for the @entity126 were enough to seal the points despite 71st and 79th minute strikes from @entity129 and @entity111 to set up a close finish			0
@entity119 found the net twice as @entity103 enjoyed a 4 - 3 win against @entity104 in 2002 6			1
@entity133 2 - 6 @entity18 , 1977 back in 1977 , @entity133 were the team going for the title and they were huge favourites at home to a @entity18 side languishing in 14th place in the old @entity139 table			2
@entity140 and @entity141 scored for @entity143 ’s side			0
but goals from @entity145 ( 2 ) , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 gave united a stunning win in front of nearly 50,000 at @entity152			0
@entity133 would go on to finish a distant third behind title winners @entity154 and @entity155 , while @entity18 wound up in tenth at the end of the season			0
@entity159 3 - 2 @entity42 , 1999 the football world would be stunned if @entity159 defeated @entity42 on home turf today , but even back in 1999 it was a big surprise when @entity164 ’s team turned over the @entity5 title challengers on @entity7			1
goals from @entity167 and @entity168 had given the @entity159 a 2 - 0 lead at the break , and while @entity171 pulled a goal back in the 67th minute for @entity42 , @entity173 restored the two - goal advantage five minutes later			1
a rare league strike away from home for @entity177 set up a tense final four minutes but @entity159 held on for what is to date their last win against the @entity52			0
former @entity159 striker @entity173 helped his side to a 3 - 2 festive period victory against @entity42 4			1
@entity182 3 - 6 @entity18 , 1991 remember when players would celebrate after scoring against former clubs ? well @entity185 did n’t just do it once , he did it twice , after netting a brace on first return to @entity190 since leaving @entity182 for @entity18 – and gesturing wildly with his arms on both occasions			2
@entity18 gave youth a chance in this clash , and @entity182 fans should have known better than to chant ‘ donkey ’ at @entity198 ’s half - time replacement , as @entity200 soon silenced his critics with a fine burst of pace on the way to scoring @entity18 ’s sixth goal			2
@entity206 4 - 2 @entity207 , 2003 it was the first year of @entity207 under @entity209 but it would be a miserable first @entity14 under the @entity212 owner as it took @entity206 just 42 seconds to get stuck into @entity214 ’s turkeys			1
@entity215 had levelled following @entity217 ’s first minute opener , but @entity218 nodded the @entity219 back in front 11 minutes before the break			0
@entity221 extended their lead to in incredible 4 - 1 margin after half - time through @entity226 and @entity227 , with @entity229 ’s 72nd minute reply for the big spending @entity159 nothing more than scant consolation at the @entity233			1
@entity218 celebrates putting @entity206 into a 2 - 1 lead against @entity207 in 2003 @entity214 ( left ) and @entity235 look dejected during the defeat 2			1
@entity207 4 - 4 @entity41 , 2007 a year before rescuing a draw against @entity42 , @entity41 were involved in another @entity14 cracker as they severely dented @entity207 ’s title aspirations at @entity240			1
a @entity241 double gave @entity41 a 2 - 0 lead , only for @entity65 to receive a red card which paved the way for @entity245 to grab a rare brace and equalise in the 50th minute for @entity207			1
@entity41 looked finished when @entity247 put the @entity159 ahead , only for @entity248 to equalise at 3 - 3 with 18 minutes left			1
@entity207 4 - 4 @entity41 saw eight goals , two penalties and three red cards @entity253 wheels away in celebration of his second half free - kick at @entity240 @entity256 was one of two @entity207 players to be sent off by referee @entity258 @entity256 ’s red card evened up the numbers , but @entity207 seemed to have stolen victory two minutes from time through @entity253 ’s free - kick			1
but @entity264 saw red having handled the ball to deny @entity41 a goal in the final minute , allowing @entity60 to rescue a point for @entity59 ’s outfit from the penalty spot			2
@entity271 4 - 4 @entity18 , 1970 a relic from a bygone era in football			1
the legends read off like any other big clash , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity221 , @entity279 and @entity280 among the big hitters			0
the game was pretty decent too , with law scoring twice along with @entity278 to help @entity18 come from 2 - 0 down to lead 3 - 2 at @entity271			2
the @entity284 hit back to lead 4 - 3 only for @entity285 to equalise for @entity18			1
but there is an old school winter feel to this game which will never be seen again			0
snow covered pitches added a different challenge to players rather than a cause for complaint at the nearest snowflake			0
check out the packed out @entity295 too			0
they sure do n’t make stadiums like that any more			0
it is games like this which prove you do n't need perfect under - soil heated stadiums or tika - taka passing to have a superb game of football or a @entity7 classic .			0
