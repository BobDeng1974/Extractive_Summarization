every transfer window , clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains , and fans argue over who their side really need			0
but , seven months after last summer 's window swung shut , which of those deals have proved to be value for money ? as we reach the business end of the season , now is the time for the men brought in to start really showing their worth			0
but who have been the best signings of the season so far ? @entity19 takes a look ... 10 - @entity21 @entity22 to @entity23 well , he finally became a hit after being allowed to play consistently			1
makes @entity23 tick , has an eye for a pass and gets himself involved in the final third , making sure the main striker does n’t have to come searching for possession			2
it ’s a mystery why @entity33 did n’t fancy the former @entity22 midfielder to begin with , but he has really made his mark since enjoying a real run in the team			0
they do love a classy caresser of a ball at @entity41 , which clearly works in his favour			0
@entity21 has finally begun to show his class at @entity41 after a slow start under @entity33 the @entity46 has become a key part of @entity23 's midfield , allowing the likes of @entity50 to flourish 9 - @entity51 @entity52 to @entity53 mr @entity54 , which is a name you do not normally associate with @entity53 defenders			1
it is baffling that @entity59 - who must have known he needed a right back on arriving at @entity23 - did not feel the need to sign a player he started in every @entity64 fixture for @entity65			2
cheap and pleased for the opportunity in the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 did their homework on this signing and it ’s helped no end at the back for the @entity76			1
@entity51 has proved excellent value for @entity53 , becoming a regular at right back in his first season @entity51 is a @entity80 international star , and @entity53 did well to pick him up for such a small fee last summer 8 - @entity82 @entity83 to @entity84 ( loan ) nine clean sheets for @entity84 with the @entity88 defender in the team and - despite him making noises that he probably wo n’t be around next season - they have easily coped with the loss od @entity92 to @entity93			1
quick enough for the @entity71 , he ’s kept up with the best and added @entity94 at the back for @entity84			1
@entity82 has shown the pace and class needed in the @entity71 since joining @entity84 on loan 7 - @entity99 @entity100 to @entity84 ( loan and then permanent ) @entity103 ’s boots may be small in a literal sense , but figuratively @entity99 had a job on			1
@entity84 were smarting at losing their teenage sensation who careered down the left last season , but it ’s as if he was never really there as the former @entity100 man carries equal threat going forward and has actually appeared more comfortable defensively			1
what good business it was then to get @entity99 snapped up on a permanent deal in january			2
@entity99 and @entity115 have been inspirational at full backs for @entity84 this season after signing him on loan in the summer , securing @entity99 permanently looks like a masterstroke 6 - @entity119 @entity52 to @entity84 a fairly unknown quantity on signing from @entity52 for £ 8m , @entity119 ’s physical presence and deftness of touch has made him a huge hit on the south coast			1
important goals and some panache to go with it , the @entity126 has earned his first international call - up while on @entity131 ’s watch and carries a severe threat inside the 18 - yard box			0
even after his goals have dried up somewhat , @entity119 ' strength and quality have been a major asset @entity119 's goalscoring start to the season earned him his first @entity126 caps , and he scored on his debut 5 - @entity142 free agent to @entity144 a deceptively effective forward , and terrific value for money for free			2
@entity142 struggled at @entity148 but redefined himself in the @entity149 with @entity150 and has taken that goalscoring form to the @entity152			0
scoring more than one in every three starts , the @entity153 has chipped in with crucial goals for @entity144 and has been a relatively unsung hero this year			0
edges out @entity84 ’s @entity158 in this list based on the respective transfer fees ( @entity158 cost £ 11.8m ) and amount of chances their sides create			2
@entity142 has chipped in with vital goals for @entity144 at an impressive record since joining for free despite a tough time in his previous spell in @entity169 , the @entity153 star has proved his worth this season @entity142 launches into his trademark celebration after scoring one of his nine @entity144 gaols this season 4 - @entity173 @entity174 to @entity175 has suffered a couple of injuries , but that has n’t had any lasting effect on his impact at @entity182 in a debut season			2
sniffs out goals from nowhere and has that low centre of gravity which has defenders quaking			0
strong in the air and with his back to goal , @entity188 brings others into play as well as netting on a regular basis			0
had he not come back from international duty injured , the @entity153 might have been pushing @entity196 and @entity197 for the golden boot			2
@entity188 's goals were a big part of @entity175 's brilliant start to this season , after signing from @entity174 the @entity153 striker has shown he can score with his head as well as his feet , and has proved great value 3 - @entity197 @entity83 to @entity100 that blistering start to the season means @entity197 will be in every list similar to this from now until may			1
his 19 @entity71 goals are one of the chief reasons why @entity100 look like winning the title			1
but it ’s not all about hitting the back of the net - fans at @entity218 have also bought into his style of play			0
the @entity222 international bullies defenders , shakes their confidence and is fairly nasty			0
@entity197 has endeared himself to @entity100 fans with his nasty side , showing aggression as well as quality @entity197 's 19 @entity71 goals already have fired @entity100 to the brink of the title 2 - @entity231 @entity232 to @entity100 where would @entity197 have been without @entity234 ? back in the capital , albeit over the other side , his campaign got off to a similarly stunning start , assisting almost at will as @entity100 battered all those put in front of them			1
yes , there is an argument to suggest his form has dipped , but @entity231 is worthy of making the list because of that reintroduction to @entity169 football			0
you get the sense he could move through the gears if necessary , too			0
providing more assists than any other player by far , @entity231 ' @entity71 return has been superb his form may have dropped off since the turn of the year , but @entity231 has still been a stand - out star offering more defensively than at previous clubs , @entity231 has become the complete midfielder this season 1 - @entity258 @entity232 to @entity259 a game - changer			1
someone who is capable of turning no points into three and putting opposition to the sword			0
fierce in possession , his burst of pace can unlock defences in a flash			0
not happy playing second fiddle to @entity271 and @entity272 at @entity232 , @entity258 has proven this term that he is one of the premier forwards in world football and shown to @entity276 why it ’s probably wise to shell out on quality every now and again			1
@entity258 's pace and skill have proved to be a match - winning combination since he joined @entity259 the @entity284 forward has provided superb goals and stunning displays since leaving @entity232 this summer no signing has had as great an impact on their new side this season as @entity259 's @entity284 superstar			1

@entity259 star @entity258 has been superb since signing from @entity232
@entity100 's @entity231 and @entity197 have been crucial to title charge
@entity84 have found value in @entity99 and @entity119
