eleven passenger planes were forced to make @entity2 calls to land at @entity4 airports last year because they were running low on fuel , it has emerged			1
new figures reveal that a total of 11 planes had to radio an emergency call to schedule an earlier landing because fuel supplies on the aircraft were so low			1
a further 100 passenger jets were also caught ' flying on empty ' , but they did n't have to make @entity2 calls , the @entity16 ( @entity15 ) figures show			1
it means a total of 111 planes ended up running low on fuel during flights in 2014 – almost double the 58 @entity4 - registered planes which recorded low fuel levels in 2013			1
new figures show that a total of 111 commercial planes were caught flying low on fuel in @entity4 airspace last year , with 11 of those planes being forced to issue a @entity2 call to land because of low fuel levels ( file picture ) however , in comparison , the number of @entity2 calls issued because of low fuel last year was two fewer than the 13 made in 2013			1
one operator , which the @entity15 did not name , was responsible for 35 of the 111 reports of low fuel in 2014 - which equates to almost a third			1
another carrier was responsible for 12 incidents , while another was accountable for 10			0
a total of 36 operators were deemed responsible for the entire 111 incidents			2
@entity47 's @entity46 experienced the highest number of reports of low fuel incidents in 2014 , the figures show			1
a total of 19 commercial planes , of mixed nationality , were found to be flying low on fuel as they approached the west @entity47 airport			1
in comparison , there were 13 planes recorded at @entity60 , four planes at @entity62 , and three at both @entity64 and @entity65			0
planes in @entity4 airspace are required to have enough fuel to complete their journey , have enough to reach another airport in case of a diversion , circle an airport for 30 minutes if necessary and still have a final emergency reserve , which is equivalent to five per cent of the plane 's original upload of fuel			1
all @entity4 operators have a legal obligation to report safety issues and a low fuel declaration falls within that scope , meaning all carriers are forced to declare when an aircraft 's fuel has not met the requirement			1
some airlines have allegedly been cutting the amount of fuel they carry to make the aircraft lighter and save money			0
others suffer fuel shortages during extreme weather when flight patterns are disrupted or aircraft are unable to land because of adverse conditions			2
a spokesman for the @entity4 @entity16 told @entity100 : ' @entity102 airlines have a legal responsibility to carry a set minimum level of fuel , enough for the aircraft to carry out its planned journey and cope with any potential issues during the flight			1
' however , in very rare circumstances , for example extreme weather , an aircraft may burn fuel faster than calculated			0
in most cases the aircraft simply lands with less fuel than expected			0
' occasionally , however , the flight crew decide to request a priority landing as they approach an airport in order to maintain its final contingency reserve fuel			0
' airlines and air traffic controllers have well practiced standard operating procedures in place to deal with these situations			0
' one operator , which the @entity15 did not name , was responsible for 35 of the 111 reports of low fuel			1
@entity47 's @entity46 ( pictured ) experienced the highest number of reports of low fuel incidents , with a total of 19 pilots ' union @entity136 described the rising number of low fuel incidents as a ' matter of concern ' and said pressure to remain competitive and keep fuel costs down must never compromise passenger safety			1
a spokesman said : ' aircraft flying on low fuel not only put that aircraft potentially at risk , but also impact on the wider operation			2
' handling an aircraft on low - fuel means that other aircraft may have to hold longer to give appropriate priority to the emergency aircraft resulting in a possible " avalanche effect "			2
' it is natural , in such a competitive industry , for airlines to look to carry as little fuel as they can in order to save weight and save money			0
but that commercial pressure must never be at the expense of ensuring a safe flight			0
' the @entity15 ’s approach to safety – that of “ @entity168 ” – is to allow airlines to make their own judgement calls on safety matters and to monitor the result			0
' therefore we hope that the regulator has picked up the fact that one company has been responsible for 30 per cent of the low fuel incidents recorded and has reacted appropriately			2
' the @entity15 confirmed that passengers were not in danger in any of the 111 recorded fuel incidents and said there was ' no safety risk to passengers '			0
in 2012 , budget airline @entity184 was recommended to ' review ' the amount of fuel it carries after three of its planes – including one from the @entity4 - were forced to make ' @entity2 ' emergency landings in @entity191 when they started to run out of fuel			1
the airline was operating with a level of fuel that was ' close to the minimum ' required in the case of a diversion , watchdogs said			2
three @entity184 @entity201 - 800 aircraft heading to @entity202 were forced to make emergency landings after being diverted to @entity204 because of thunderstorms over the @entity191 capital			2
at the time , the @entity207 recommended @entity184 ' reviews its fuel policy and considers issuing guidance to crew with respect to fuel when operating into busy airports with mixed aircraft operators and types , particularly in poor weather conditions when diversions are likely			0
' a @entity184 spokesman said : ' the official @entity222 report into the three @entity204 weather diversions in july 2012 confirmed that all three aircraft took extra fuel ( because of adverse weather ) , all three aircraft flew for one hour more than scheduled ( due to the diversions ) and all three aircraft fully complied with @entity230 safety regulations			0
' and in october last year , a @entity232 flight from @entity233 to @entity234 landed with critically low fuel levels			1
the plane landed with just 900kg of fuel left after a problem with the aircraft ’s wing flaps saw meant it had to be diverted from @entity234 to land at @entity64			2
the jet should have had 1,627kg of ' final reserve , ' as indicated in the @entity246 's report			0
the diversion lowered the fuel to dangerous levels , when the pilot could have landed the @entity201 757 at @entity65 , which was closer , or back to @entity234 once the problem was corrected			0
a spokesperson for @entity252 told @entity100 : ' as a result of the @entity246 ’s and our own internal investigation , we have completely reviewed pilot training for go - around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control			1
the aircraft landed safely at @entity64			0

111 commercial planes caught flying with low fuel levels in the @entity4 last year
of those , 11 planes were forced to issue a @entity2 call to land due to fuel
one airline operator is responsible for 35 of the 111 reports - almost a third
low fuel level figures nearly double the 58 @entity4 planes reported in 2013
planes must have enough fuel to finish journey , circle airport or be diverted
