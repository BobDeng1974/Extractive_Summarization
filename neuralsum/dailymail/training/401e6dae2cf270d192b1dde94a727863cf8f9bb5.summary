@entity2 special forces failed in an attempt to free the @entity5 hostage who @entity7 militants have threatened to kill , it has emerged			1
jihadist militants released a second sickening video on tuesday which showed @entity2 journalist @entity11 being beheaded by a fighter with an @entity14 accent			1
at the end of the video , a @entity5 hostage is filmed on his knees in a similar orange jumpsuit to those worn by the two men already killed by the extremist group , sparking fears he could be their next victim			1
@entity2 journalist @entity11 ( pictured ) was the latest victim of @entity7 jihadists and a video of his killing included footage of a @entity5 hostage , who it is feared could become the fanatics ' next victim it is believed the @entity5 hostage , who is not being named by @entity5 media , and @entity37 ( pictured ) , who was the first man killed in the videos , were the subject of a failed rescue mission earlier this summer it has now come to light that the man - who @entity43 is not identifying him at the request of the @entity5 government but who has been named and pictured around the world - was the subject of a failed rescue attempt by @entity2 commandos earlier this summer			1
last month the @entity52 revealed it had launched the attempt to rescue a number of hostages held in @entity56 , including @entity37 , the journalist killed in the first video			1
but the mission failed to bring back any hostages because the jihadist gang had moved prior to @entity2 commandos ' arrival			1
the @entity5 hostage is believed to be an aid worker who was based on the @entity65 border of @entity56 , working with victims of war			1
government sources have stressed that @entity5 has a long - standing principle not to publicize kidnappers or terrorists			2
but @entity5 authorities are in touch with the man 's family and are continuing to provide support for them , it is understood			1
it comes as president @entity80 has said that @entity2 will not be intimidated by the ' horrific ' violence of the @entity82 following the brutal execution of mr @entity11			2
@entity84 , who will meet @entity86 leaders in @entity87 later this week , has branded the latest video ' absolutely disgusting and despicable ' journalists mr @entity11 ( left ) and mr @entity37 ( right ) had been covering the war in @entity56 when they were kidnapped speaking in @entity91 , @entity92 , mr @entity80 vowed that ' justice will be served ' and that a coalition will be built to ' degrade and destroy ' @entity7 , which has taken control of vast swathes of @entity56 and @entity97			1
however , failed to give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to attack the terror group 's operations , saying : ' it 'll take time to roll them back '			2
mr @entity80 spoke at a news conference with president @entity106 after arriving in @entity92 to show solidarity with @entity109 leaders who fear they could be the next target of @entity112 's aggression			0
during the conference , he added that the prayers of the @entity2 people are with the family of the ' devoted and courageous journalist ' mr @entity11 , who deeply loved the @entity119 world and whose ' life stood in stark contrast to those who murdered him so brutally			2
' meanwhile , @entity5 prime minister @entity84 said in a statement that he would chair an emergency response meeting with his @entity125 on wednesday to review the latest developments			1
mr @entity84 has hit out at the ‘ absolutely disgusting , despicable ’ murder of mr @entity11			0
he said : ' if verified , this is a despicable and barbaric murder			0
my thoughts and prayers are with mr @entity11 ’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation			0
@entity11 's mother @entity135 had appealed directly for the return of her son last week @entity11 , a 31 - year - old @entity138 - area native who freelanced for @entity140 and @entity141 magazines , vanished in @entity56 in august 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed @entity37 's beheading			1
dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid @entity56 landscape , @entity11 was threatened in that video with death unless the @entity2 stopped airstrikes on the @entity82			1
in the video distributed on tuesday and titled ' a second message to @entity2 , ' @entity11 appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the @entity82 , the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across @entity56 and @entity97 and declared itself a caliphate			1
the executioner appears to be the same man who killed @entity37 – known as ‘ @entity160 ’ - and tells the camera : ' i ’m back , @entity80 , and i ’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity82			1
' he warned president @entity80 that as long as @entity2 airstrikes against the militant group continue , ' our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			2
' ' justice will be served ' : president @entity80 ( pictured ) today said that @entity2 would not be intimidated by the ' horrific ' violence of the @entity82 after a second @entity2 journalist was brutally beheaded on video speech : speaking in @entity91 , @entity92 , mr @entity80 vowed that ' justice will be served ' after the video was verified visit : mr @entity80 ( left ) spoke at a news conference with president @entity106 ( right ) after arriving in @entity92 to show solidarity with @entity109 leaders who fear they could be the next target of @entity112 's aggression the footage - depicting what the @entity2 called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of @entity37 and just days after @entity11 's mother pleaded for his life			1

there will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time , ' @entity195 said			0

' we are all outraged at reports from @entity97 about the brutal killing of civilians by @entity7 , including yesterday 's ( tuesdays ) reported brutal beheading of another journalist , ' he said			2
in @entity216 , @entity215 spokeswoman @entity214 said @entity2 intelligence analysts will work as quickly as possible to determine if the video is authentic			1
he said it is believed that ' a few ' @entity2 are still being held by the @entity7			2
@entity214 would not give any specifics , but one is a 26 - year - old woman kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in @entity56 , according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety			1
no statement : president @entity80 boarded @entity229 to @entity92 yesterday without addressing the nation the fighter who apparently beheads @entity11 in the video calls it retribution for @entity80 's continued airstrikes against the group			0
the killer specifically mentions the recent @entity2 airstrikes around the @entity240 dam and the beleaguered @entity97 town of @entity242 , making it unlikely that @entity11 was killed at the same time as @entity37 , as some analysts had speculated			1
over the weekend , @entity97 government forces with help from @entity2 airstrikes broke the @entity82 's two - month siege of @entity242 , a town where some 15,000 @entity250 had been stranded			1
in a statement on tuesday evening from @entity253 , military officials said an airstrike conducted on monday against @entity82 militants near the @entity256 damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles			0
the @entity258 , a @entity2 terrorism watchdog , first reported the video 's existence			1
in a sign of disorganization - or perhaps dissension - in the extremist group 's ranks , a faction of the @entity82 apparently posted the video early , before it was supposed to be released			0
in a later @entity269 message , those responsible apologized and asked fellow jihadis not to ' reproach ' them			0

in its rise to prominence over the past year , it has frequently published graphic photos and gruesome videos of bombings , beheadings and mass killings			0
last week , @entity11 's mother , @entity286 , pleaded with his captors for mercy , saying in a video that her son was ' an innocent journalist ' and ' an honorable man ' who ' has always tried to help the weak			2
' @entity11 grew up in the @entity138 area , and graduated from @entity293 , a prep school in @entity294			0
as a student at @entity297 , @entity11 ' developed a passion for reporting and writing , a gift that he shared with people around the world , and this unthinkable act of terror has taken him from us far too soon , ' @entity294 gov , @entity295 said in a statement			0
@entity11 then attended the @entity308 , which said he majored in journalism from 2002 to 2004 but apparently left without graduating			0
just how @entity11 made his way from @entity311 to @entity313 hotspots is not clear			0
he published articles from @entity56 , @entity315 and @entity316 in a variety of publications			2
several focus on the plight of ordinary people in war - torn places			0
a friend puts a consoling arm around @entity11 's father art on the day that he found out his son had been brutally executed by @entity7 militants in @entity56 in a statement , @entity329 said it was saddened by news of his death and called him a ' brave and talented journalist ' whose reporting ' showed a deep concern for the civilians caught in the middle of a brutal war			1

' @entity347 foreign affairs chairman rep. @entity346 , a @entity349 @entity348 , said the new video demonstrates the @entity82 's ' barbarity across the region - beheading and crucifying those who do n't share their ideology			2
' he said the @entity2 and allies need to step up military action against the group , including through airstrikes			2
at @entity11 's parents ' home in @entity363 , @entity311 , two police vehicles blocked the driveway tuesday , and officers advised journalists to stay away			0
