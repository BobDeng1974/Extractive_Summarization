by @entity1 reporter published : 04:08 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 04:10 est , 18 june 2012 a little boy born with cerebral palsy has taken his first steps just days after a life - changing operation in @entity7			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was unable to walk unaided because of his condition but less than three weeks after a pioneering operation in @entity13 he has defied the odds by bravely taking his first strides			1
members of the public helped six - year - old @entity8 ’s family raise the £ 50,000 needed for the four - hour operation following a 10 - month fundraising campaign			1
his mother @entity21 , who is terrified of heights , even managed a 300ft bungee jump as part of their mission			1
standing tall : @entity8 's mother @entity21 said his progress has been remarkable			1
he recently managed 15 unaided steps doctors have said @entity32 ’s progress since the operation has been ‘ remarkable ’ and proud mother @entity21 said watching her son take his first unaided steps had made all the hard work worthwhile			1
she said : ' it was an unbelievable moment , it was everything we have dreamed of for so long and something we thought we might never see			1
@entity42 is another word for the brain			1
@entity45 means a complete or partial loss of the ability to move a body part			2
so cerebral palsy means loss of ability to move a body part because of a problem with the brain			2
cerebral palsy is not a single condition			2
it is an umbrella term used to describe a group of conditions that cause movement problems			2
although the main problem is with the muscles in one or more parts of the body , the condition is caused by damage or faulty development in a part of the brain			1
the part of the brain affected is that which sends messages to muscles			1
the damage or faulty development usually occurs when a baby is in the womb			2
sometimes it occurs during , or shortly after , birth			2
depending on the type of cerebral palsy and the area of brain affected , a child may not be able to walk , move , talk , eat or play in the same ways as other children			0
' he ’s a stubborn thing who does n’t like to be told he ca n’t do something and that ’s how it started			0
he began to get up and his cousin was telling him not to because he could n’t walk without his sticks and he just said ‘ yes i can , i ’ll show you ’			0
' ' he took two steps , then got back up and did four and in the end managed to walk about 15 steps over to his grandma			0
' he was so proud of himself afterwards and it was great to be able to see his face because he knew he ’d done something really important			0
' @entity103 , known as @entity32 , has a form of @entity105 known as @entity106 , which accounts for 80 per cent of cases			0
it is caused when brain damage occurs in the outer layer of the brain and affects the legs more than the arms			0
@entity32 underwent a series of operations in may to straighten and strengthen his legs at the @entity118 in @entity13 last month			0
the procedure , known as @entity120 , involves cutting the nerves in the spine to release the spasticity ( tension ) in @entity126 muscles , allowing him to move far more freely			1
although the operation has just become available at a hospital in @entity130 , funding it not widely available			0
doctors expect @entity32 to be regularly walking unaided within six months and physiotherapy to help develop his leg muscles could take up to two years			1
however , following @entity136 cuts the family now have to raise up to an additional £ 8,000 for two years of private treatment with a specialist nurse			0
the family have pledged to hand any money left over from the rehabilitation costs to another child with cerebral palsy looking to fly to the @entity144			0
