from a beheading in @entity1 to the hard - line repression of religious freedoms in @entity4 , a string of extremist acts in recent weeks have raised the worrying spectre of a new era of @entity10 fundamentalism spreading across the world			1
over the last month , the world 's media has been awash with gruesome images of barbarism - pulled into sharp focus in recent days with the barrage of horrific videos and hate - filled messages pouring onto the internet from @entity21 militants in @entity1			1
but it is far from restricted to that country alone			0
in just the last few days : global fundamentalism : some of the countries spanning two continents where extreme @entity10 acts have been perpetrated in recent days and weeks another form of religious extremism has also gained widespread attention and subsequent outrage in @entity4 , where a mother was handed the death sentence for marrying a @entity34 and was forced to give birth in shackles in prison			1
@entity38 was released after an international outcry , but yesterday was re-arrested and charged with fraud as she tried to leave the country with her @entity43 husband , @entity42 , and their two children			2
the @entity4 authorities claim she failed to use her @entity48 name on her travel documents			2
just tonight , an explosion in a @entity52 shopping mall killed at least 21 people and injured 17 more as the nation prepared to watch its football team play @entity57 in the @entity58			1
people watched on as smoke filled the sky after an explosion at a shopping mall in @entity64 , @entity52 , just hours before the start of tonight 's @entity58 match against @entity57 , which killed at least 21 people a suicide bomber killed himself and wounded several security officers at a hotel in @entity70 , @entity71 , close to the @entity73 embassy firefighters spent the day tackling the blaze at the @entity77 hotel after the bomb attack - the latest in a series of terrorism attacks carried out in the past few days around the world witnesses said the blast - just an hour before tonight 's match - left body parts scattered around the @entity85 in an upmarket district of @entity64			1
no one has yet claimed responsibility but the attack bears the hallmarks of @entity92 extremists			0
at the same time , firefighters were tackling a blaze at a hotel in @entity70 , western @entity71 , after a suicide bomber killed himself and wounded several security officers , close to the @entity73 embassy			1
also yesterday , the highest court in @entity99 upheld a ban on @entity101 using the word @entity103 to refer to their own god in what some experts fear is the latest step in a creeping islamisation of the country			0
disturbing : an @entity111 militant holds the prisoner 's head as he prepares for the execution while a young boy ( circled ) watches on just a few feet away taking no prisoners : footage posted on @entity118 appears to show @entity111 militants carrying out summary executions on dozens of captured soldiers in @entity122 in @entity124 , voters were heading to the polls for parliamentary elections which they hope will bring in a government that can clamp down on violence at the hands of a patchwork of militias , including @entity10 extremists , that continues to grip the country since the ouster of @entity136			1
meanwhile , the lightning insurgency by @entity21 militants @entity111 threatens to overthrow the @entity140 - led @entity1 government and even break up the entire country as it seeks to create an @entity10 state			1
@entity143 , a @entity144 security analyst at @entity145 in @entity146 , said he had noticed a rise in extremism in recent weeks and months , but said @entity10 was n't to blame			1
he told @entity149 : ' all the empirical evidence shows that it is on the rise			2
you 're seeing it in all the headlines , then you 're looking at @entity1 , you 're looking at @entity122 , you 're looking at @entity52			2
' but in all three cases this has nothing to do with @entity10			0
i think people in the @entity160 may think it is because they feel alienated by @entity10			0
there is alot of @entity164			0
' horrific : @entity166 attacks in @entity167 claimed by @entity168 , left at least 60 dead			1
five people were killed in another attack a few days later attack : @entity52 are calling for action after @entity92 militants are said to have kidnapped a further 91 people after snatching nearly 300 schoolgirls two months ago mr @entity143 said more and more communities - often disillusioned by austerity or other grievances - have turned to religious groups as an alternative to secular regimes in recent years			1
he said : ' when communities become disenfranchised - and lot of them are muslim - they use @entity10 to further their particular cause			0
' they adhere to a radical interpretation of @entity10 , but it has nothing to do with the religion			0
' @entity111 , in particular , appear to relish their growing publicity , increasingly courting online platforms such as @entity195 and @entity196 to promote their hate - filled agendas of murder and oppression			0
professor @entity200 , international terrorism expert and head of @entity204 's @entity203 , @entity205 and @entity206 , said : ' images of brutality perpetrated by these terrorist groups are being circulated around the world on an unprecedented scale			0
' while the levels of brutality seen here by @entity111 and @entity168 are no different from what we have seen them do before , the way they are publicising their acts of terror is wholly new			2
' cruel : @entity38 poses hours after her release with her husband , @entity222 ( left ) and her children , @entity222 ( on @entity222 's knee ) and @entity225 and all those who bravely fought for her freedom in @entity4 after she was sent to death row for marrying a @entity34 ongoing civil war in @entity122 adds further instability to the fragile @entity144			1
in nearby @entity232 , @entity231 insurgents hellbent on destroying the first peaceful transfer of authority , ordered voters not to participate in the weekend 's general election			0
and in further blow to the global fight against terrorism , @entity52 's former president , @entity237 , said the 200 schoolgirls taken snatched from the classrooms in the village of @entity244 by @entity245 in northeast @entity52 in april may never return home			2
@entity92 , which wants to set up an @entity248 caliphate in @entity250 's largest economy , has fought back against an army offensive and killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks , striking as far afield as the central city of @entity255 and the capital @entity64			1
‘ i believe that some of them will never return			0
we will still be hearing about them many years from now , ’ @entity237 told the @entity259 's @entity258 radio service last week			0
‘ if you get all of them back , i will consider it a near - miracle ... '			0
