@entity0 has been left with a £ 200million conundrum after admitting he will be forced to leave out at least one of his attacking big hitters against @entity5 at @entity6 on sunday			1
with @entity10 ’s injury crisis over , @entity8 ’s biggest challenge now is to make sure he does not disrupt the team balance with too many stars after an 11 - match unbeaten run			1
and the way the @entity17 was talking , he has already decided not to play all of his ‘ famous five ’ — @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity0 has conceded he will have to leave out one of his so - called ' famous five ' against @entity5 the @entity17 insists he will not hide behind the excuse of squad rotation when selecting his team @entity10 are in the rare position of having practically their entire squad fit for the visit of @entity5 so far , @entity8 has not had to make this toughest of choices because at least one of the quintet has always been injured or not match - fit			1
but the goalscoring return of @entity37 off the bench at @entity39 last weekend means all five are available			0
it is a decision @entity8 has typically promised not to shirk and to his credit he insists he will not hide behind the excuse of rotation			1
‘ i have said for years the highest number of players you can put in who are mostly creative is four			2
i still have the same opinion in 25 years			0
so when you call these players then i have to choose , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i always put in the best line up , not rotation			2
you understand the difference ? ‘ you can call it rotation if a player is tired and then it ’s better to play with the other quality player , but normally i look at the qualities of my opponent , the qualities of my selection and also the mental situation of my players			1
’ @entity21 ( left ) is eager to make his loan move permanent while @entity20 ( right ) has never been dropped at @entity10 @entity10 and @entity68 captain @entity19 is expected to keep his place in the side @entity22 ( right ) made a scoring return from injury against @entity39 while @entity23 ( left ) has impressed in the playmaker 's role @entity75 @entity19 17 8 5 @entity21 11 3 3 @entity23 15 5 3 @entity22 13 3 6 @entity20 19 8 3 @entity19 ( £ 27million ) , captain and close to overtaking sir @entity77 as the club ’s record goalscorer , is probably the only one who will wake up fully confident of being selected to start			1
@entity80 ( £ 24m ) has never been dropped in his @entity10 career and was @entity8 ’s captain at the @entity83 but is no longer ‘ bomb proof ’ due to competition for places			1
@entity21 , who will cost £ 43m if @entity10 make his loan move permanent next season , showed his finishing skills to save his team in their last @entity92 game at @entity93 on @entity94 but @entity8 questions his contribution outside the penalty area			1
@entity23 ( £ 38m ) was tipped to be the sacrificial lamb when @entity8 arrived but has been in outstanding form as a genuine @entity99			1
@entity37 ( £ 60m ) has been absent with injury while @entity10 have embarked on their unbeaten run			1
he takes risks on the ball that are not normally associated with a @entity8 team but it would still be a huge call , even for someone of the @entity17 ’s inpenetrable confidence , to axe the most expensive player in the @entity92			1
@entity8 insists he will not swayed by leaving out a player like @entity37 just because he cost a @entity111 record transfer fee @entity21 saved his manager 's blushes by scoring against @entity93 to earn a draw on @entity94 publicly , @entity8 insists he will not be swayed by the size of a player ’s transfer fee			1
neither can @entity118 or the @entity10 board be expected to sanction a move for @entity21 if he does n’t make the first xi , although @entity8 again says he does not automatically agree with that			1
‘ you can have in your squad selection more than four creative players			2
but only in the line - up you can put four players			2
so there is a big difference , ’ he said			0
‘ it is not for you to decide about @entity21			2
i have read he is very happy here and wants to stay			0
‘ i am a different manager			0
the best players , what i think , make the best team			0
the money is not interesting			0
for me , it is not interesting			0
’ after a tough start to life at @entity6 with 50 different injuries to contend with , @entity8 is warming to his task now			1
@entity10 sit third in the table with @entity143 and @entity144 above them and his ambition to be top dog at the end of 2015 does n’t look unrealistic now			2
leaving @entity23 out of the starting line - up would likely see @entity19 move back out of midfield into the @entity99 position @entity8 is brave enough to make difficult decisions , including leaving out his former international captain @entity80 @entity8 was smiling like a kid in a sweetshop when he announced that he only had one player , @entity156 , injured and unvailable for @entity5			1
@entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity37 are fit again after damaging absences			0
@entity161 and @entity21 should be fully up to speed in terms of match sharpness			1
besides fitting in his star forwards , the @entity17 has to continue developing @entity10 ’s own youngsters @entity166 and @entity168			1
he hopes in time to produce a side as pleasing on the eye as some of @entity173 ’s great entertainers			0
‘ of course , i want more as a manager , i want the perfect game and we ’ve not played the perfect game , like @entity178 and @entity179 20 years ago ( @entity178 won 2 - 0 at the @entity180 )			0
‘ i expect more attacking quality from @entity10 and from a team that i coach			2
so now i coach @entity10 , i expect more attacking quality			2
if not this year , then next season or the season after that			0
but i shall improve and you shall see it			0
’ @entity189 international @entity158 ( 2nd left ) is one of several players returning to full fitness at @entity6 @entity10 players are put through their paces at the club 's @entity195 ahead of sunday 's game @entity156 is the only member of @entity10 's squad you is sidelined after limping off against @entity93 @entity200 gives short shrift to managers who claim they need more time @entity8 wo n’t rule out january signings but only if the right player becomes available			1
if he has to wait for @entity206 of @entity207 , he will wait			0
‘ i do n’t prefer to wait until summer when i can improve my selection			0
i have shown that with @entity213 , ’ he said , referring to last week ’s signing of the former @entity210 goalkeeper			0
‘ when we can buy a player who can improve my selection i , or the club , shall buy			0
money is not interesting , it is always what i have to say , the quality of the player in comparison with the other players that i have			0
and i have to compare and i have to decide			0
the money does n’t play any role			0
‘ when i can not improve my selection then i wait			0
and then i have to wait maybe a year more , because maybe you think there are so many fantastic players who can join			0
but it is not like that			0
’ @entity5 will be a tough test			2
@entity10 were extremely fortunate to leave @entity232 ’s with a 2 - 1 win last month after a double from @entity80			1
@entity8 ’s compatriot @entity200 still has the club on course for an unlikely @entity239 challenge			2
the two @entity240 have n’t always been the best of friends — dating back to a rivalry when working together at @entity178 — but the @entity10 boss could n’t give @entity5 higher praise going into this game			1
the @entity10 manager has not ruled out making more signings in january after bringing in former @entity210 keeper @entity213 @entity8 will come up against his former friend and protege @entity200 when @entity5 arrive at @entity6 on sunday @entity10 were fortunate to come away from @entity232 's with a 2 - 1 victory when the sides met back in december ‘ when i see the quality of the players and the coaching staff , i think they could finish in the top four			1
i think it would be good for @entity259 football to have a different club qualifying for the @entity239 and i think @entity5 have the chance this year			2
‘ they made it very difficult for us at their ground and i think they will give problems again because they have a very good team			0
i like the way they play			0
‘ but we are a month further on from that game and maybe we have improved , i hope so because we are in a process , i hope we have improved so we can show that against @entity5 but it shall be very difficult because they are very good			2
’ while @entity5 think about the top four , the four occupying @entity8 ’s mind are his four superstar forwards — and who to send out at @entity6 .			1

@entity275 placed @entity10 host @entity5 in their @entity92 clash on sunday
@entity0 has conceded he will have to leave out one of his ' famous five ' star players from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity21
the former @entity189 insists he will not hide behind the excuse of squad rotation or be swayed by costly price tags
for the first time in his @entity6 career , @entity8 has almost a fully fit squad with only @entity156 sidelined
