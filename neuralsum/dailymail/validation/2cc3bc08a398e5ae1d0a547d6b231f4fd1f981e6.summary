a first trophy as @entity3 manager was a huge , significant step for @entity5			1
he took the old cup from @entity8 , skipped down the @entity10 steps and refused to let go until the ‘ @entity11 ’ — his ceremonial bonding session with the club ’s supporters			2
but this was a day when sobriety was the @entity19 watchword			0
sober reflection , followed by a sober celebration			0
@entity3 ’s first @entity22 since 2009 is the platform for @entity5 to become only the third @entity3 boss to win a domestic treble			1
a piece in the jigsaw , no more			0
the @entity3 players celebrate on the podium with the @entity31 after beating @entity32 2 - 0 at @entity10 @entity3 manager @entity5 gets ready to lift the @entity31 with his players as @entity3 kicked off their celebrations a @entity36 replay against @entity32 — who else ? — beckons on wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of @entity42 ’s fast - food outlets cashing in on a @entity3 team session last night			1
the players , captain @entity45 included , were under orders to be in bed by midnight			2
‘ we should enjoy the moment , ’ said a relieved @entity5 after an eventful , if unremarkable , final			1
‘ but there is not going to be any nightlife			0
’ we should have known @entity45 would be a key figure here again			0
the @entity3 skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards – both rescinded – when these teams met at @entity59 last week			1
his manager then overlooked the front - page pictures of a night of rabble - rousing in @entity63 before the final			1
yet the greatest let - off of all might have been here when referee @entity66 denied @entity32 – who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick			1
popstar and devoted @entity3 fan @entity8 hands @entity3 captain @entity45 the trophy after the 2 - 0 victory over @entity32 @entity45 lifts the @entity31 alongside keeper @entity77 ( right ) after a difficult week in the headlines @entity3 captain @entity45 takes a selfie with a unusual phone case in hand as he captures the moment at @entity10 @entity83 ( left ) , who scored @entity3 's first after 28 minutes , poses with the @entity31 trophy on sunday @entity32 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity85 7 ; @entity86 6 , @entity87 6 , @entity88 6 , @entity89 5 ; @entity90 6 ( @entity91 72 ) , @entity92 6 , @entity93 6 ; @entity94 6 , @entity95 6 ; @entity96 6 ( @entity97 59 ) subs not used : @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 booked : @entity94 sent off : @entity86 @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity77 6 ; @entity104 7 , @entity105 7 , @entity106 7 , @entity107 7 , @entity108 8 ( @entity109 81 ) , @entity45 7 ; @entity110 7 , @entity111 7 , commons 7 ( @entity113 67 ) ; @entity114 7 ( @entity115 67 )			1
subs not used : @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120			0
goals : commons 28 , @entity113 79 referee : @entity66 attendance : 49,259 @entity124 : @entity108			1
@entity3 were ahead at the time			1
they had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper @entity86 collided with @entity127 and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches			1
he was gone for fully eight minutes			0
‘ i was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long , ’ said manager @entity131 afterwards			0
‘ it proved costly for us			0
‘ i had @entity136 ready to come on and i was going to put @entity94 to right - back			2
unfortunately , i do n’t have a magic wand for those circumstances			0
’ @entity86 would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on @entity107 in 56 minutes			1
thereafter , @entity3 dominated , scoring again through @entity113 and emphasising why the @entity145 club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment			1
he was n’t to blame for the insipid @entity89 free - kick which allowed @entity77 to gather and trigger a @entity3 counter			1
but it was from his position that @entity110 – who had a fine game - chipped a left - foot cross that was prodded towards goal by @entity83 , changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of @entity88			1
somehow @entity85 in the @entity32 goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post , but @entity161 would not be denied , thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1 - 0			1
‘ hindsight is a wonderful thing , ’ pondered @entity131			0
‘ if we had scored from that @entity89 free - kick , everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time			1
’ there was more cause for @entity32 regret in 36 minutes when @entity176 , chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by @entity45 , a villainous figure through @entity59 eyes			1
referee @entity66 had a good , long look then decided to turn the other way			0
@entity45 had ducked @entity186 punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another @entity59 gripe against authority			0
not without justification , it should be said			0
@entity113 curls in the second goal for @entity5 's side as the @entity196 leaders proved their superiority at @entity10 @entity115 ( left ) , on loan from @entity199 , celebrates @entity113 's strike for @entity3 as they beat @entity32 @entity3 manager @entity5 urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble @entity113 roars in celebration with the @entity3 fans at @entity10 erupting after @entity5 's team prevailed 2 - 0 in the @entity31 final predictably , @entity5 – perhaps seeing it through green and white shades – saw things differently			1
‘ it was hard to say , but , from what i have been told , it was a good decision , ’ he claimed			0
‘ i think the referee was very good			0
we are after him whenever he does something wrong , but you have to give them credit when they do a good job			0
’ in contrast , @entity32 foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes			1
last sunday , @entity90 and @entity89 were sent packing			0
@entity90 ’s proved to be a nonsense , but @entity86 ’s here was inarguable			1
the defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on @entity107			1
the @entity230 was fortunate to escape serious injury			0
on the @entity32 touchline @entity131 raged with the perceived injustice of it all			2
his side had lost the @entity236 against @entity237 last may and they knew , now , another showpiece occasion was slipping away			2
@entity3 ’s extra man was telling			2
@entity32 captain @entity86 ( right ) is sent off for this late challenge on @entity3 defender @entity107 @entity86 ca n't hide his devastation after the @entity32 captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at @entity10 in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity108 , they had the best players on the pitch			1
in 67 minutes , @entity111 got across @entity247 to jab a @entity114 cross towards goal , the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow @entity32 escape			2
it was the last act for @entity114 before he made way for @entity115			0
@entity113 replaced the @entity161 and the substitutes would make quite an impact			2
@entity113 and @entity115 started brightly enough , the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the @entity260 teed up a @entity111 cut - back			1
their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time			0
@entity83 managed to fire @entity3 ahead from an acute angle during the first - half , as @entity5 ( right ) roars in celebration commons put the @entity3 ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with @entity3 commons is congratulated by his team - mates having put the @entity196 leaders in front during the @entity22 final referee @entity66 showed no hesitation when @entity113 was pulled back by @entity89			1
‘ he was very quick to point to the spot that time , ’ said a caustic @entity131 afterwards			0
@entity113 grabbed the ball , resisting @entity115 ’s determined and very vocal efforts to do the same			2
the winger placed the ball down , then placed a weak effort too close to @entity85 , the @entity32 keeper preventing a third goal			2
an unimpressed @entity5 explained afterwards : ‘ both of the players who were going to take a penalty , @entity114 and @entity83 , were off the park			1
it looks like it was the first to the ball , but i do n’t like that they argue about that			0
@entity113 earned @entity3 a penalty late on under this challenge from @entity32 's @entity89 in the closing stages several @entity3 players wanted @entity115 to take the spot - kick but @entity113 insisted and eventually missed his penalty ‘ it is stupid			1
that is not the team spirit i want			0
’ as the final whistle signalled a significant day for the @entity301 , @entity115 marched straight down the tunnel in a huff , clearly furious			2
he was retrieved by @entity304 , possibly on @entity5 ’s orders			2
‘ there is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers , especially , want to score goals , ’ he continued			0
‘ again , we have to put the team in front of ourselves			0
it is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience			0
this is not team spirit			0
it is individual thinking - and i do n’t want anything to do with that			2
’ collectively , @entity3 have much to excite them			2
a treble hovers on the horizon			0
the late night celebrations can wait			2
keeper @entity77 gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne at his team - mates @entity3 goalkeeper @entity77 poses with the @entity31 trophy in the winning changing room @entity3 boss @entity335 enters the dressing room with a smile on his face after the @entity3 won the @entity31 final goalscorers @entity113 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) pose with the @entity31 final trophy in front of the fans after a testing week in the headlines for the @entity3 captain , @entity45 holds up the trophy in front of the adoring fans @entity5 hopes to become the third @entity3 manager to achieve a domestic treble with @entity3 , having won the @entity22 on sunday			1
