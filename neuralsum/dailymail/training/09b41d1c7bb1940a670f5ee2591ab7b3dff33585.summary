gay rights activists are protesting new @entity2 show ' my husband 's @entity3 ' , claiming the show 's stars are actively trying to advertise a discredited therapy program that claims to turn homosexual men straight			1
the show , which airs tonight , follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men , but are living as heterosexuals in order to follow their @entity15 faith , which does n't recognize gay marriages			1
groups like @entity18 has called the show ' irresponsible ' and ' dangerous ' for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs			1
while @entity2 has staunchly denied that the show condones these programs , it has now been revealed that at least three of the stars are spokespeople for organizations which practice this discredited method			1
the men on the reality show admit that they are attracted to other men , but have chosen to live as heterosexuals because of their @entity15 faith promoters : it has now been revealed that the @entity43 and co-star @entity44 ( pictured ) are spokespeople for a group that promotes a therapy program to turn homosexual men straight outrage : as of sunday , more than 123,000 people had signed an online petition to get the show cancelled			1
@entity2 has refused to back down , and the show is set to air tonight at 10pm his story : @entity54 was the former chairman of @entity55 , a @entity15 group which promoted a therapy to help homosexual men ignore their urges and live as heterosexuals			1
pictured above speaking at a conference on the issue in 2012 @entity18 president and ceo @entity62 recently described what is so dangerous about these therapy programs in a recent interview			1
' basically , gay reparative therapy is the notion that you can take the gay out of somebody , which we know is not true , ' @entity67 told @entity74			2
' medical experts have debunked that for ages now , and also it 's illegal in a lot of states			0
' married couple @entity30 and @entity83 have both acted as spokesmen for three such organizations - @entity85 , @entity55 and people can change			0
before it was absorbed into @entity85 last year , @entity54 was the chairman of @entity55 , a @entity89 organization that promoted ' reparative therapy ' for those with ' same - sex attraction '			2
the therapy - pioneered by the group @entity93 and @entity94 - has not been supported in the psychological community which recognizes homosexuality as a normal human orientation			0
while it was still running , the group advertised therapy that helped people ' diminish ... same - gender attractions and overcome homosexual behavior '			0
at a 2012 conference , @entity54 even gave a speech about his own struggles with ' same - sex attraction ' which he said ' are almost invariably rooted in deeper issues '			0
in another video from 2013 , @entity54 again promoted ' ex-gay ' therapy , saying that he thinks it 's possible to prevent these urges			0
when @entity55 shut down in january 2014 , it became absorbed into @entity85 , where @entity54 joined the board			0
his wife @entity115 has been actively involved in both @entity85 , @entity55 and another similar organization - people can change			0
the @entity117 ( left ) and @entity44 ( pictured with his wife @entity118 , right ) have all promoted the gay therapy programs through their respective organizations meanwhile , co-star @entity44 , who is also married to a woman , is the co-founder of @entity85 and has written many essays on the website			1
he has also defended ' sexual orientation change efforts '			0
@entity2 does not mention the @entity43 or @entity44 's involvement in these organizations in the special , which @entity128 columnist @entity127 calls a ' clear attempt to deceive the viewers '			2
it 's also strange that the network does n't mention @entity85 , since the group claims that all of the stars on the show are involved in their community in an online post			2
as of sunday afternoon , more than 123,000 people had signed a petition to have ' my husband 's @entity3 ' cancelled			0
but @entity2 has refused to back down and the show is scheduled to air tonight at 10pm et.			1

the show follows four men who admit they are attracted to other men , but choose to live as heterosexuals because of their @entity15 faith
gay rights groups have called for the show to be cancelled for portraying sexuality as a choice that can be changed with therapy programs
@entity2 has defended the show , saying the couples only speak for themselves
it has now been revealed that at least three of the stars on the show have worked for groups that promote this type of therapy
