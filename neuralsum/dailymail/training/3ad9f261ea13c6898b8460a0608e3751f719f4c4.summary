separated : @entity0 with @entity1			1
despite the case being thrown out he was not allowed to see her again @entity0 's adopted daughter @entity1 penned an open letter saturday on a @entity7 blog , publicly accusing the controversial filmmaker of sexually assaulting her when she was a young girl			1
@entity1 's first - person account , which appeared on reporter @entity12 's blog , marks the first time that @entity14 , the daughter of actress @entity15 , has directly addressed the alleged sex abuse			1
in gut - wrenching detail , @entity1 wrote in her statement how at age seven , her adoptive father , @entity0 , allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house			1
' he told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother ’s electric train set , ' miss @entity15 recounted			1
' then he sexually assaulted me			2
he talked to me while he did it , whispering that i was a good girl , that this was our secret , promising that we ’d go to @entity34 and i ’d be a star in his movies			0
' she noted that to this day , she finds it hard to look at toy trains			0
@entity1 went on to describe how the award - winning director of ' @entity43 ' and ' @entity40 ' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like , including sticking his thumb in her mouth , forcing her to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap. ' i thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters			1
but what he did to me in the attic felt different , ' she said			0

the girl 's explosive allegations put an end to @entity1 and @entity0 's relationship in 1992 , setting off a legal battle in which @entity78 claimed the filmmaker accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking that he had assaulted her			1
what followed next was a drawn - out process in which @entity78 was dragged from one psychologist to the next , recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying			0

@entity0 , 78 , has always denied the allegations of sexual abuse			1
he was never charged with , or convicted of , a crime in this case			0

‘ actors praised him at awards shows			0
networks put him on tv			0
critics put him in magazines			0
final straw : @entity78 explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another @entity201 nomination for his latest film , @entity202 ‘ each time i saw my abuser ’s face – on a poster , on a t - shirt , on television – i could only hide my panic until i found a place to be alone and fall apart			2
’ @entity1 's decision to offer a first - person account of her torment has been spurred by @entity0 's latest nomination for an @entity201 and last month ’s @entity217 ceremony , where he received the prestigious @entity218			1
‘ it felt like a personal rebuke , like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away , ’ @entity78 wrote			0

support system : both @entity78 's mother , actress and activist @entity15 ( left ) , and her adopted brother @entity242 ( right ) , have stood by her claims regarding @entity0 strong words : @entity0 's son and ex-girlfriend were n't happy about him receiving an honour at the @entity217 ‘ missed the @entity0 tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity43 ? ’ the newly hired @entity259 host wrote			1
@entity1 concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie - going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father			2
‘ so imagine your seven - year - old daughter being led into an attic by @entity0			2
imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name			0
imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter			0
‘ are you imagining that ? now , what ’s your favorite @entity0 movie ? ’ shaming stars : @entity78 lambasted actors like @entity239 and @entity287 who had starred in her father 's film ; @entity290 was on hand last month to present @entity0 with a lifetime achievement award			0
