by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 11 october 2013 the husband who survived the brutal invasion of his home that left his wife and two daughters dead is now being courted by local @entity7 officials to run for office			1
dr @entity9 is known best for being the survivor of the 2007 home invasion that left his @entity14 house burnt and his wife and teenage daughters raped and killed by two men during a robbery gone awry			1
he has since gotten remarried and his new wife is pregnant with their first child together , and now he may be launching a political career			1
next ambition : dr @entity24 ( seen here at a trial appearance in 2011 ) is considering a run for @entity27 earlier times : @entity30 's first wife @entity9 ( center ) and their daughters @entity29 ( top left ) and @entity34 ( bottom left ) were all killed in a 2007 home invasion the local newspaper reports that he is being considered as a possible contender to challenge the sitting @entity40 in the state 's 5th @entity27 district			1
' he certainly has a lot of what people are looking for			2
he 's got strong ideals and he 's not afraid to stand up for them , ' said @entity48 , the @entity49 chairman for @entity50			2
' he 's lived through hell and back			2
he 's obviously got tremendous internal strength , ' mr @entity48 told the @entity53			0
mr @entity48 is not just basing his predictions on optics either as dr @entity30 , who made his career as an endochrologist has been meeting with the state @entity7 chairman , @entity58			1
mr @entity58 has not denied their meetings , saying that he has had ' informal discussions with prospective candidates on a regular basis '			0
one of the issues that apparently seems the most daunting to the would - be first - time candidate is the schedule as he would have to start campaigning and fundraising very soon in order to be competitive against @entity70 congresswoman @entity69			0
moving on : in 2011 , he married @entity71 , who he met through the foundation that he established in his wife and daughters ' memories happy turn : in august of this year , the couple announced that they were expecting a baby ms @entity69 was elected in 2012 , so she is only in her first term			1
he is no stranger to taking a stand and raising money , however , as the @entity84 that he established in honor of his slain wife and two daughters has accrued $ 1million that they then passed on to organizations working to support violence victims			2
and while it would be his first time running for office , he would not be entirely new to the prospect , as his father launched a failed bid for @entity97			0
' he 'll have to take positions on topics he has n't really thought a lot about before			0
â€¦ it 's getting down to crunch time , ' mr @entity48 told @entity103			0
' until you do it , you do n't realize how much groundwork has to be laid and how much money has to be raised ... it 's a lot of dough			0

dr @entity24 was the sole survivor of a 2007 home invasion where the two *attackers* *sexually* assaulted and killed his wife and daughters
in 2011 he married @entity71 , a woman he met through the foundation that he set up to honor his wife and daughters ' memories
@entity71 announced in august that she is pregnant with their first child
now @entity30 is being considered as a possible @entity7 challenger to *unseat* a @entity40 in @entity27
