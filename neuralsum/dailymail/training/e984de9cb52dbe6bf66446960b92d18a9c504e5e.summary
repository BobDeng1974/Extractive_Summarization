haemorrhoids occur when the anal cushions become enlarged around 50 per cent of us will suffer from piles - swollen tissue and blood vessels in the back passage			1
@entity7 , 57 , a paediatric secretary and mother - of - four from @entity9 , took part in a study to determine the best way of treating this common problem , as she tells @entity14			1
piles have troubled me since the birth of my second child , @entity18 , who 's now 35			1
at first it was just a bit of discomfort when i went to the loo			1
occasionally , the piles would stick out , but i 'd just push them back and put up with it			1
over the years it got worse , though			1
a decade ago the piles had prolapsed to the point where i could n't push them up			1
they 'd bleed , and were getting more painful and itchy			1
i finally decided to take action three years ago after a test under the @entity33 bowel cancer screening programme found blood in my stool ( which can be a symptom of cancer ) , and i had to submit another sample			1
the second test was clear , but it spurred me to see my gp about the piles			1
a prescription haemorrhoid ointment , @entity42 , relieved the itching , but the bleeding was still there			1
so , last summer , i had a colonoscopy ( where they examine your bowel with a camera on a tube ) at @entity52 in @entity9			1
this ruled out cancer , but my surgeon professor @entity55 said he would treat my piles with a procedure called banding			1
they put small rubber bands around the piles , cutting off the blood supply and making them @entity62 did n't help			1
so at my six - week follow - up , he said i could take part in a trial comparing two other treatment methods			1
this would involve having traditional haemorrhoidectomy ( where they cut off the piles ) or stapled haemorrhoidectomy ( where they lift the piles back in place and secure the area with titanium staples )			1
i would n't know until the day of my treatment which one they 'd do , but i did n't mind : i just wanted a solution			2
on the day of the op , i was told i 'd be having the stapling			2
back home , i followed post-operative instructions - taking the painkiller co-codamol , laxatives , and warm baths to help ease the pain			2
the pain lasted a week			2
more concerning was the urgency i experienced , which meant being within easy reach of a loo			2
but after three weeks it had all settled down			2
now , three months later , the outcome is fantastic and the piles have gone			2
we 're all so embarrassed to speak about these things , but i just wish i 'd had them treated sooner			2
stapled haemorrhoidectomy accounts for 20 per cent of all piles surgery professor @entity55 is a consultant colorectal surgeon at @entity103 and chief investigator of a trial comparing piles treatments , led by the @entity107			2
haemorrhoids occur when the anal cushions - pads of soft tissue , filled with blood vessels , that form part of the watertight seal around the back passage - become enlarged			1
common symptoms are pain , bleeding , itching and prolapse - when the piles start to descend through the anal canal			1
causes include chronic straining , constipation and pregnancy			2
piles can also run in families			2
they can go away of their own accord			2
if not , a gp would generally recommend avoiding straining , taking mild laxatives , and eating plenty of fruit and fibre to loosen stools			0
creams or suppositories can give some relief			0
many contain a steroid which can take away the itch but wo n't cure the problem			1
the most common treatment is rubber - band ligation , where bands are placed around the haemorrhoids to interfere with the blood supply and shrink them			1
a third of patients will get a good result with this			0
other treatments are surgical , usually for piles which protrude all the time			0
in one procedure , excisional haemorrhoidectomy , we remove the piles using a cautery device - a surgical instrument through which an electric current is passed , cutting off the haemorrhoids and sealing the tissue with heat			0
stapled haemorrhoidectomy accounts for 20 per cent of all piles surgery			0
here , we use a special stapling instrument , around 18in long and 1in wide , to remove a section of the lining of the lower rectum			0
this allows the protruding haemorrhoids to be pulled back inside the anal canal , and cuts the blood vessels that supply the piles			0
then we fire in staples to seal the area			0
these will either stay in the patient or get passed out during bowel movements			0
as piles operations are common - 29,000 a year - surgeons need to know the best option for controlling symptoms long - term			1
so the @entity189 has given us Â£ 1.3 million to carry out a definitive trial across 32 centres			0
called @entity193 , it 's a comparison of stapled versus excisional surgery			0
@entity7 was randomly selected to have the stapling			1
first the patient is examined under general anaesthetic to check the size of the piles , which can be up to 3cm long			0
through a hollow tube , we weave a purse string stitch ( which you can pull tight , like a drawstring ) into the lining of the rectum just above the piles			0
we insert the stapler into the rectum and draw the stitch tight , so that it pulls a ring of tissue , about 1cm wide , into the stapler - this has the effect of hoisting the haemorrhoids back into the anal canal			0
a knife inside the stapler then cuts off the trapped tissue			0
at the same time , it fires two or three rings of titanium staples to seal off the area			0
then we apply local anaesthetic			0
it takes 20 to 30 minutes - the same as traditional excision			0
the risks for both methods are the same : pain , post-operative bleeding , and men may have difficulty emptying their bladder , so may need a catheter overnight			0
some patients also describe urgency ( the body can mistake healing tissue for faecal matter ) but that soon settles			0
at this stage i do n't know which technique is better			0
this trial will help us find out			0
