@entity1 manager @entity0 has praised the resurrection of @entity3 as the big @entity4 prepares to play in the fixture that marked the low point of his @entity8 career 12 months ago			1
on march 25 last year , @entity3 was jeered by both @entity10 and @entity1 fans as he was substituted in a 3 - 0 @entity1 defeat that proved the deathknell to the manager who signed him , @entity14			1
even more hurtfully , @entity17 legend @entity16 was scathing about @entity3 's @entity1 career up that point , saying on television : ' i 'd be expecting a lot more of him			1
' @entity1 manager @entity0 has praised the rebirth of resurrection @entity3 @entity3 , pictured against @entity25 on april 4 , is expected to start against @entity10 on sunday in the corresponding fixture last season , the @entity4 ( back ) was criticised by fans and pundits in a 3 - 0 loss things have changed dramatically since then with @entity3 developing into a more effective @entity32 than @entity33 , @entity34 or @entity35 have been this season			1
playing off @entity34 , @entity3 has allowed @entity0 to play 4 - 3 - 3 with @entity37 and @entity33 either side of the centre - forward			2
@entity1 have won five league games in a row and are in third place , a point ahead of @entity10 for sunday 's derby			1
' @entity3 always does the things that we want from him			2
he is performing what we want from a midfielder , we have other players who are too creative and too emotional to do the job , ' said @entity0			0
' i ’ve always said for the balance of our team you have to also defend as well as attack and you have to beat the pressure from the opponent			0
@entity3 plays a factor in all these aspects , we needed him in the team , now he has that role and he plays his role very well			1
' @entity3 , who cost £ 27million when @entity14 signed him from @entity63 , has scored three goals in @entity1 's revival and also scored three times for his country in their two recent @entity69 qualifiers			1
as importantly , his aerial presence in both penalty areas has helped @entity1			2
his overall physicality has helped @entity73 bring back a formation that he used earlier in the season against @entity76 , @entity10 and @entity77 , without winning any of them			1
this season though , @entity79 has been impressed with the midfielder 's ( right ) ability in defence and attack ' we have n't got the tallest team and have problems with the long ball , ' admitted @entity0			2
' so we press more than we used to			0
we have changed our shape to 4 - 3 - 3 because you can press better , i tried it at that time but we could n't do it			0
it ’s a process and now we can do it			0
' typically for @entity0 though , there was a sting in the tail in case @entity3 should start to believe the good publicity			0
' i took him off against @entity25 in the last game , that was n't for no reason , ' stressed the manager			0
@entity79 also had praise for @entity104 goalkeeper @entity103 who is interesting @entity105			0
the @entity1 boss has until now been reserved in his praise for @entity103 but he went on a charm offensive yesterday after the keeper made a rare mistake to allow @entity25 's @entity111 to score last weekend			1
' @entity112 has had a marvellous season and everybody knows that			0
he was very important in a lot of matches and therefore i ca n’t change him , ' said @entity0			0
@entity3 ( right ) has proved a more effective no 10 than club record signing @entity35 this season			2

@entity1 face @entity10 in the @entity120 on sunday
@entity3 has played a vital role in @entity1 's rise to third in the table
