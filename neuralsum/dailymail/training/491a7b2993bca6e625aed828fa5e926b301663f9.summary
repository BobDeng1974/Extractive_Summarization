@entity11 , 33 , was sentenced to 35 years in prison last week , and will be on supervised probation for the rest of his life , for repeatedly molesting a @entity17 boy , now 15 , and filming the appalling acts			1
the sexual abuse began when the boy , who suffers from a learning disability , was encouraged to enroll in a mentoring program in 2004 , after he was teased by his classmates			1

but the paedophile 's apprehension was not easy			0
the @entity40 had seen the shocking footage in june 2009 and passed it on to @entity2 special agent @entity42 , who was tasked with identifying the @entity44 man and young boy in the distressing film			1
at first it was not clear if the pictures showed other victims being abused too , but @entity42 ’ investigation ‘ cemented the fact that it was the same kid , over several years in @entity17 and @entity52 , ’ he said			0
but despite sending pictures of the boy to schools in @entity17 , reviewing @entity58 listed in the state ’s sex offender database and canvassing hotels in @entity62 where some of the abuse had taken place , the agent was no closer to determining the identities of the two			2
' it was a massive undertaking that led to absolutely nothing , ' @entity42 told the newspaper			0
we did n’t find anything			0
' justice : @entity74 district judge @entity73 , pictured in june 2007 , sentenced @entity11 to 35 years in a federal prison but a breakthrough came in october 2009 after @entity2 agents in @entity78 investigating a ring of paedophiles who traded images of child pornography were led to a @entity84 man who had posted images of the @entity17 boy in question being abused			1
the man gave agents the victim ’s name , and @entity11 ’ , whom he said had moved to @entity93 authorities told @entity42 that the child had in fact tried to reach out about the abuse before , telling a school official in 2008 that @entity11 had forced him to watch ' dirty movies ' , but later retracting his statement			1

he had also stayed in touch with the boy after returning to @entity27 with weekly phone calls and emails			1
@entity2 special agent @entity42 was also pivotal in the imprisonment of @entity113 's kidnapper			2
the 14 - year - old was abducted from her bed at her home in @entity118 , @entity17 , at knifepoint in june 2002 by @entity120			0
@entity121 said @entity120 took her to an encampment near @entity118 , pronounced her his wife , and raped her repeatedly			0
he also forced her to view pornography , drink alcohol and watch him and his wife @entity128 engage in sexual activity			0
@entity42 was the agent who interrogated @entity120 on march 12 , 2003 , the day of his arrest , alongside @entity118 police detective @entity131 , where he said @entity133 had commanded him to abduct the girl , now 24			0
during the two hours of fierce questioning , @entity120 said @entity121 had had a ' glorious experience ' with him during her nine months in captivity			0
his answers were used against him in his trial and he was sentenced to life in prison			1
@entity128 was sentenced in may 2010 to 15 years for her involvement in the case after she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping			2
@entity42 had to find out a way of bringing @entity11 back to the @entity74 and the boy ’s mother had a plan			1
she said she would pretend the family was throwing a surprise party for the boy , whose birthday is in early january , and invite @entity11 along			1
it was a difficult plan for the mother , as she was forced to talk to the man who had repeatedly abused her son as if nothing had happened , in the hopes that he would attend			0
' she reached out to @entity161 and lucky enough for us , that ’s exactly what he did , ' @entity42 said			0
' we would still be dealing with all kinds of treaties , just trying to locate him and get him up here but we used the mom and she was awesome			0
we would n’t have him in custody if it were n’t for her			0
' @entity11 was arrested on the day of the surprise party in january 2010			2
' we had him in custody thanks in large part to mom ’s ability to keep her cool and play this script we had written out , ' @entity42 said			0
two months later , the agent was working with @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity182 , on child pornography cases when he came across footage of three boys being abused my a @entity44 man while they slept			1
' it was the same guy , ' @entity42 said			0
until then , @entity11 ' family had refused to believe the allegations against him , but when they were shown the new footage to see if they recognised any of the children , they revealed it was @entity11 ' own nephews			2
' until that point [ @entity11 ] was going to go to trial and make us put this kid on the stand and talk about all [ these ] things , ' @entity42 said			2
' once we showed the family photos of him molesting his own nephews , that ’s when he decided he was n’t going to fight this any longer			0
' after his arrest , @entity11 allegedly told the @entity2 that he had not hurt the boy			1
' you guys hurt him when you talked to him about what happened , ' he said , according to the newspaper			0
in february this year , @entity11 admitted to travelling from @entity17 to @entity62 to engage in a sexual act with a child under the age of 12 , between june 2005 and july 2006			2
he also admitted to engaging in sexual acts with the child in @entity17 before and after the trip			0
as part of his plea agreement , prosecutors dropped other counts of aggravated sexual abuse , production of child pornography and distribution of child pornography and agreed to recommend he spend 30 years , rather than life , in prison			1
but @entity74 district judge @entity73 said that given the age of the victim , and the abuse of his family 's trust , he would have to add another five years , according to the newspaper .			2

@entity11 , 33 , was last week sentenced to 35 years in prison , and will be on supervised probation for the rest of his life
he fled to @entity27 after images the abuse began circulating online , fast becoming among the most popularly traded child pornography in the world
but he still kept in touch with the victim with weekly phone calls and emails
he told the @entity2 that he had *n't* hurt the boy and that authorities had when they talked to him about the abuse
