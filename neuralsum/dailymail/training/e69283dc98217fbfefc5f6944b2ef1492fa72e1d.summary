a family has spoken of their shock after spotting an animal more at home in the rainforests of @entity6 than their garden in an @entity9 market town			1
@entity10 first noticed the unusual creature â€“ thought to be a @entity12 - being chased by the family dogs round their garden in @entity15 , @entity16 , this afternoon			1
at first , she thought her pets - a @entity18 and @entity19 - were playing with another dog			0
but then she realised the animal was a little more unusual			0
' they were going mental - i think they probably would have tried to eat it if it was any smaller			0
' @entity10 , 23 , called for help from her father @entity39 , and the two rushed out into the garden - just in time for the bear - like creature to disappear up the tree			1
' it shot up a really tall tree , ' she said			0
they quickly called for reinforcements - and nearby animal charity @entity47 sent out a volunteer to help try to catch the ' bear '			1
but even with the help of a net , they were unable to catch the animal - which fled towards the banks of the @entity26			1
' they said it was probably someone 's pet bear which had escaped , ' @entity10 said			2
' it is definitely not from around here			0
' the @entity60 confirmed it had also had a call about the animal a couple of days ago - described by a concerned resident as either a badger or a bear			2
but they were unable to find it			0
she thought the animal may have been a small bear - but it seems it may have been a @entity71 coati a @entity71 coati , otherwise known as a ring - tailed coati , sitting in a tree in its natural habitat a closer inspection of the video seems to reveal it is not a bear at all , but a @entity71 coati , a small animal weighing between two and 7.2kg , and measuring just 33 to 44 inches			1
half of their length is made up by their tail - but , in this case , the tail appears to have been severely shortened			0
this breed of coati was first discovered in @entity6 , and lives in the jungles and rainforests of @entity71			2
if right , it is not the first time the coati has been spotted in @entity15 : two years ago , a group of ramblers spotted an animal later confirmed as a coati in a wood near the market town			1
on that occasion , it was thought the coati had escaped from a sanctuary on an estate at @entity107 , @entity108 on @entity26 , owned by @entity109 , of the @entity111 construction empire .			0

@entity10 spotted the ' small dog ' out the *window* of her @entity15 home
but on closer inspection , she realised it looked more like a baby bear
the animal fled to the top of a tree - where she was able to film it hiding
the creature could be a @entity71 coati - a small , *racoon* - like animal
it would *n't* be the first time a coati was in @entity15 - one was spotted in 2013
