by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 01:57 est , 1 may 2012 in the wars of the @entity3 , uniforms just served to keep soldiers warm - but in future wars , they 're likely to be complicated electronic systems			1
the @entity7 is researching uniforms which can detect where soldiers have been shot - and also detect whether they have been exposed to nuclear or biological agents			1
sensors for blood , radiation and chemical poisons would be woven into the uniforms themselves - dubbed ' @entity16			1
' super soldier ? an earlier prototype shown off by the @entity20 army			2
one of the concerns with the new ' @entity16 ' is to keep the bulk of the uniforms down to manageable levels the uniforms - in a proposal submitted by the @entity7 this week - would also carry gps units and radios , so that their assessment of a soldier 's health can be radioed back to base			1
it 's one of a range of hi - tech options the @entity36 and defence companies are currently researching for soldier 's uniforms , including glasses that give soldiers ' super vision ' and uniforms with electric fabric that allow soldiers to communicate with one another via radio			1
medical sensors built into uniforms would be no gimmick , either - at present , the first medical assessment a soldier receives is when staff reach him			1
on the battlefield , there can be severe delays			2
of course , the idea here is n’t to replace medical care with material			2
it ’s to give medics and surgeons a major head start , by offering initial diagnostics that ’ll speed up the process			2
no doubt , that ’d be an invaluable aid where soldier survival is concerned , ' says @entity72 's @entity71 blog , which reported the proposal			0
' in a situation where a soldier has been hit with either a single bullet or shrapnel from an explosion or has been exposed to chemical , biological or radioactive agents , within their surrounding environment , it is critical to quickly evaluate the vital organs that have been impacted and the life - saving procedures that need to be performed , ' says the @entity7			1
' with @entity88 , the location of a bullet can be determined with appropriately - embedded sensors within the clothing ’s fibers that can estimate the depth of penetration and the effected surrounding organs			1
additionally , if the person was in an environment where a @entity98 weapon had been stored , manufactured , or used , the @entity88 could identify the agents via specific biomarkers detected within the blood , saliva , sweat , urine			1
' @entity105 in a scene from the 1992 film : universal soldier : the @entity20 military is increasingly creating gadgets that resemble the sci - fi film 's plot , with ' intelligent ' uniforms the latest idea to be tested the hi - tech glasses under trial with the @entity36 will allow information to be ' beamed ' directly into soldier 's eyes from a pair of hi - tech glasses the @entity36 has placed an order with @entity123 for lenses which focus 3d battlefield information from drones and satellites directly into people 's eyeballs			1
the tiny ' screens ' sit directly on users ' eyeballs and work with a pair of lightweight glasses with a built - in translucent screen			0
' warfighters need to maintain their full vision while on the battlefield , ' says the company			0
' at the same time a tremendous amount of data , graphics and video are collected and are required by specific warfighters in the field			0
another groundbreaking high - tech military system will allow any soldier in a unit to ' see ' through the eyes of any of his comrades			0
the new technology , which features communication antennas woven into the fabric of military uniforms , means video from a helmet - mounted camera , voice commands and gps data can all be transmitted at once , even in the heat of battle when soldiers might be lying flat to avoid enemy fire			1
the system is designed to improve the awareness of a military team as a whole , allowing soldiers to see through the eyes of their team mates in real time			1
fighters of the future : the groundbreaking high - tech army infantry system features communication antennas woven into its fabric the way the antennas work mean there is no need for soldiers to carry conventional radio whip - antennas which can be cumbersome and conspicuous			1
@entity181 , which has developed the series of @entity183 ( @entity184 ) , says it allows effective communication while helping improve soldier 's agility in the field			0
a spokesman said : ' our demonstrator shows off the capability of this technology which transmits voice , video data and gps location via the same antenna			0
' if one soldier spots a situation , they can alert the team and share what they can see through their helmet mounted camera			0
' the demonstration system links with a wrist - mounted commercially available touch screen smart phone and utilises its sensors to provide an augmented operational picture			2
' this allows the team to tag objects , such as potential hazards which will appear highlighted on the phone 's video image			0
brothers in arms : the equipment allows for far greater communication between troops in the field ( file photo ) ' another major advantage of the wearable antenna system is that it is unaffected by the position of the wearer			0
' with conventional whip - antenna systems , if a soldier has to lie on the ground , the communication between them and that of someone who is standing up can be severely compromised or even lost			0
' similarly , the signal from the short antenna on a portable radio can be masked by the user 's body			2
a @entity184 system can be designed to give continuous 360 degree coverage			0
' @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 from @entity245 said : ' @entity247 soldiers carry a huge amount of weight when on patrol			2
' research into body wearable antennas has shown we could reduce this burden and in the future give forces improved communication capabilities and a significant advantage on the battlefield			0
' @entity181 is now exploring the potential of incorporating the system into the suits of fire - fighters for use during search and rescue , and for police patrol team members .			0

' @entity16 ' will radio base to warn if soldiers are under attack
' smart fabric ' will detect from urine or sweat whether biological or radioactive agents have been used
uniforms will also detect bullet impacts
one of a range of new ' *cyborg* ' technologies under test by the @entity36
