built at a cost of £ 1 billion , @entity0 is the jewel in the crown of the @entity4 and the setting for its self - mocking satire @entity6			1
but in a development that could have come straight out of the sitcom , it has been revealed that the @entity11 is paying tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ' money to book meetings in nearby buildings because the headquarters lacks space			0
new @entity18 in @entity19 covers half a million square feet , took a decade to build and was opened by the @entity20 in 2013 – four years behind schedule and at least £ 55 million over budget			1
one of the running jokes in @entity6 is that its fictional meeting rooms are named after popular entertainers – @entity35 's character @entity36 , the @entity4 's ' head of values ' , frequently meets colleagues ' inside @entity39 '			1
now , in response to a freedom of information request , the @entity4 has admitted it ' occasionally ' runs out of meeting rooms and spent £ 47,198 on booking external spaces nearby during the last financial year			1
corporation insiders say these venues include @entity48 's @entity47 business centre and the luxury @entity50 – both just across the street from @entity0 – and that meetings have included ' leadership breakfasts '			0
the huge building has specially designed ' huddle zones ' and a ' meeting tower ' on stilts in the atrium one source said : ' the leadership breakfasts at @entity59 are renowned for the lavish catering			0
the @entity4 is cutting jobs but can still afford to cater for breakfast meetings for senior managers			2
' another said : ' it 's bonkers to hold meetings across the street			0
' the @entity4 has been criticised by spending watchdog the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) over the running costs of @entity0 , which are almost double that of comparable buildings in @entity19			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ' it is occasionally necessary to book nearby venues , especially for larger meetings			2
value for money is always taken into account			0
' but @entity78 , chief executive of the @entity79 , said licence fee - payers would be furious over spiralling costs			0
new @entity18 is home to three 24 - hour news channels , nine radio networks and 6,000 staff .			2

new @entity18 in central @entity19 took a decade to build
it was opened by the @entity20 in 2013 at least £ *55million* over budget
but the @entity4 has now admitted it ' occasionally ' runs out of meeting rooms
