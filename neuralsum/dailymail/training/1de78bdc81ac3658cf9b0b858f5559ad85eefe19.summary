by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 concern : @entity3 @entity3 has dismissed claims that ethnic origin entitles @entity7 fans to call themselves the ‘ @entity9 ’ by insisting only ‘ three or four per cent ’ are @entity8			1
@entity7 rallied around their supporters , after @entity12 chairman @entity11 urged police to prosecute those who hold aloft banners bearing the name ‘ @entity9 ’ and chant it during games			1
club bosses welcomed the police response that there was ‘ no deliberate intent to cause offence ’ and that it was more a form of self - parody by a predominantly @entity8 support			2
but @entity3 , the comedian and writer who is himself @entity8 and a fervent @entity29 fan , is adamant such a line of defence was factually incorrect and that anti-semitic abuse should be stamped out wherever it occurs			1
‘ the idea that @entity7 fans are reclaiming the y - word and are entitled to because so many of them are @entity8 is simply not true , ’ he said			1
‘ there are only 250,000 @entity8 in @entity37 as a whole and i ’d say about three or four per cent of @entity7 ’s crowd is @entity8			1
‘ that means well over 90 per cent of those chanting “ @entity9 ” are not actually @entity8 and that is just one of several reasons why it can not be right			1
if , for instance , there was a team in @entity47 called @entity48 , and they had a mainly white support who adopted the n - word as their badge of honour and went round chanting “ @entity54 ” , they would be closed down tomorrow			0
‘ at @entity7 , the club ’s “ jewishness ” is just an historical association with the area			2
it ’s doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual @entity8 in the ground at home games ( only 0.4 per cent of the @entity37 is @entity8 )			1
so the argument “ but it ’s just like @entity64 using the @entity51 ” does not apply to most @entity7 fans			2
’ @entity7 fans chant ' @entity9 ' at @entity70 clash - click here to read @entity73 's report although some @entity7 fans may view ‘ @entity9 ’ as nothing more than a label identifying which team they follow , @entity3 has experience of why the term has more sinister undertones			1
‘ i was at a @entity29 match with my brother @entity83 two years ago , ’ he said			2
‘ it was n’t even @entity7 we were playing			2
it was @entity87 , but news that @entity7 were losing at @entity89 appeared on the big screen and this bloke sitting behind us started saying “ f * * * the yids ! f * * * the yids ! ” followed by “ f * * * the @entity8 ! ”			1
if there was any doubt about it being an anti-semitic term , rather than a name for a group of fans , that answered it			0
it was daubed across the @entity111 by @entity113 ’s @entity112			0
‘ the only possible reason why a culture which has tried to dismiss other race - hate words to the margins of language would consider it acceptable is if the racism of which it is a part is somehow less offensive , somehow less significant , than other racisms			0
‘ this is actually what the normalisation of the word at football has led to			0
it might seem strange that the fan at @entity29 could have shouted “ f * * * the yids ! ” without a steward intervening : racist abuse at football grounds is supposed to lead to an immediate ban			1
‘ but a friend of mine , a @entity135 fan , who once heard his fans chanting the y - word , with menaces , at @entity7 fans , on complaining to a steward was told , “ i do n’t hear any racism ”			1
‘ that ’s why i decided to bring out a video on the subject and there was one objective — to make this sort of racism heard , above the chanting			0
football fan : @entity3 supports @entity29 ‘ the only fans shown in the film chanting the y - word are @entity29 and @entity154 ones ; the fans shown extemporising from yiddo into a song celebrating @entity158 are @entity29 ones			1
this is important , as the debate seems to have got mired into being just about @entity7 fans			2
‘ the chant , and associated anti-semitic abuse , exists far beyond @entity164 , at the above - mentioned clubs , at @entity166 , at @entity167 , even at @entity168			2
‘ @entity7 , of course , can lay claim to be the only club chanting it in support of their team			0
i respect and acknowledge that			0
but there are reasons why that , too , has to be addressed			0
‘ although @entity7 fans consider they are just responding to racist taunts , the continuing use of the y - word by @entity7 fans informs and sustains the racist abuse aimed at @entity7 by other fans			0
the more @entity7 do it , the more it comes back			0
in full voice : @entity7 fans sing at the @entity164 ‘ many opposing fans feel they are justified in using the chant ( and associated anti-semitic abuse ) because “ the @entity187 is what @entity7 call themselves ”			1
‘ additionally , we can not mount a campaign aimed at stopping fans chanting anti-semitic abuse and using anti-semitic language while saying , “ but of course , it ’s ok for this one set of fans ”			0
‘ it has to be zero tolerance			0
and , as i have said , most @entity7 fans are not in fact @entity8			1
if we are going to have zero tolerance , it has to be a level playing field , applied to all forms of racism			0

@entity8 comedian believes @entity7 supporters are not entitled to use term
' it 's doubtful more than five per cent at @entity164 are actual @entity8 '
' i know i *'m* a @entity29 fan but there has to be zero tolerance '
