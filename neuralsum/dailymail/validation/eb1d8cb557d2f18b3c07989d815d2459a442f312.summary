a 3,000 - year - old @entity1 settlement believed they could predict the future by using sheep and cow bones - and what they revealed on one occasion caused them to suddenly flee their homes			1
in a series of three @entity14 shrines , archaeologists have found knucklebones of animals with certain sides blackened - like the markings on dice - as well as stamp seals printed onto pieces of dough			1
experts believe the artefacts were used by diviners to help leaders plan political strategies - but they were abandoned in place moments before the inhabitants fled the region			1
the experts believe the artefacts were used by diviners to help leaders plan political strategies the reason for the sudden exodus remains unknown , but archaeologists believe the stones and bones suggested their demise was imminent			1
the bones were marked with burns and other engravings , and were small enough to roll			2
in one shrine , researchers found 18 pebbles			1
' these stones appear to have been selected for their smooth , rounded shape and their colour palette , which ranged from black and dark grey to white , green and red , ' wrote professor @entity63 , lead author of the study at @entity65			2
the shrines were discovered in a hilltop fortress on the @entity68 of central @entity69			1
@entity70 : a form of divination by which the future is told using stones or reflected light from these stones			1
in modern practices 13 stones are cast and a prediction is made based on how they fall			0
@entity82 : the use of bones for divination , or osteomancy , has been performed for thousands of years			1
in some cultures the bones were burned in a practice known as pyro - osteomancy			1
@entity89 : this is the practice of baking messages inside cakes or cookies , which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told			0
dice - like knucklebones used for osteomancy and coloured stones used for lithomancy were found deep within the ruins of the fallen citadel of @entity103			1
@entity89 is a likely explanation for grinding implements found in another of three shrines			1
@entity89 was a practice in which messages would be baked inside of cakes or cookies , which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told			0
' what is conspicuous about the grinding installation in the east citadel shrine is the lack of a formal oven for bread baking , ' professor @entity63 wrote			0
the shrine 's basin ' was clearly used for burning materials and certainly could have been used to bake small balls of dough , but it is unlikely that it would have been used to cook loaves of bread			1
' the stamps may have been used to seal messages within the dough			1
the @entity131 was sparsely populated until around 1500 bc when a nameless group of people began to build strongholds and new institutions of rule there			0
' it was a time of radical inequality and centralised practices of economic redistribution , ' professor @entity63 added , ' and the political leaders were scrambling to hold on to their power			0
in particular , dice - like knucklebones used for osteomancy and coloured stones used for lithomancy were found deep within the ruins of the fallen citadel of @entity103			1
aleuromancy - divination through the use of flour - is a likely explanation for grinding implements found in another of the three shrines ( pictured ) the shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed			1
divination paraphernalia appeared to have been abandoned before the inhabitants fled and experts said it 's hard to know whether the citadel 's demise was foreseen			1
a clay idol is shown left while the right image shows what is considered another idol ' knowing what the future held was critically important			0
' during the time these shrines were active , a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of @entity69 so there are no written records of its local rulers			2
the diviner , professor @entity63 continued , would have been a kind of an early risk analyst , assessing strategies and advising on politics and finances			0
' we call them ' shrines ' because of two distinctive qualities of the spaces : they were quite intimate in scale , with not much room for public spectacle , ' professor @entity63 explained			0
' yet they appear to have been religiously charged places , designed and built to host esoteric rituals with consecrated objects - secretive rites focused on managing risks by diagnosing present conditions and prognosticating futures			2
' during the time these shrines were active , a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of @entity69 and so there are no written records of its local rulers			2
the diviner would have been a kind of an early risk analyst , assessing strategies and advising on politics and finances			0
the fortress remains are pictured elsewhere the archaeologists uncovered clay bowls filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts			0
they suspect that , as part of an ancient ritual , rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances			0
the altar and basin of a shrine excavated on the fortress ' citadel is shown the shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict			1
the group that controlled @entity103 was likely wiped out as a result			0
the @entity14 in the @entity234 can be divided into two parts - the @entity14 from around 2,500 to @entity236 , and the @entity14 from 1500 down to 900 bc. the earlier part is famous for its rich burials from localised cultures			1
in the later @entity14 a far more homogenous culture came into being			2
the @entity14 also saw an increase in the number of hillforts sites			2
these had begun in the @entity14 and reached their peak in the early @entity245			2
their divination paraphernalia , meticulously unearthed by the archaeologists , looks as if it had been abandoned in place			2
professor @entity63 added that without @entity14 mystics to interpret the bones and stones , it 's hard to know whether the citadel 's demise was presciently foreseen			1
' it does n't appear to have been reoccupied , ' said professor @entity63			0
' it was probably attacked by one of its neighbours ... but these practices probably went on in neighbouring areas			0
' we 're now trying to figure out what exactly happened to these ancient people			0
' elsewhere , the archaeologists uncovered clay bowls filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts in these shrines			0
archaeologists found two funnels ( @entity274 ) ) that were used to burn substances at the shrine site the shrines were discovered in a hilltop fortress in @entity103 on the @entity68 of central @entity69			1
@entity103 is a town in the @entity280			0
the @entity131 was sparsely populated until around 1500 bc when a nameless gourp of people began to build strongholds and new institutions of rule there the researchers suspect that , as part of an ancient ritual , local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances			2
' our best evidence of this comes from pollen washes , ' professor @entity63 told @entity298			0
' we take the pottery and wash with distilled water			0
we then capture the run off			0
from this we found residues of grape , and something similar to @entity306 which is a stimulant			1
' the shrines were found close together at @entity103			2
workshops dedicated to metal , bone and stone tool production were also found in this region			0

@entity14 shrines were found on @entity68 in central *armenia*
researchers said these shrines contained evidence of divination rituals
*including* osteomancy and lithomancy - divination using bones and stones
knuckles from sheep and cows were used as dice to predict the future
while stamps on pieces of dough were used for divination 3,000 years *ago*
shrines were used for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict
divination bones were abandoned suggesting rulers predicted their demise
pottery in the shrine also had traces similar to stimulant @entity306
