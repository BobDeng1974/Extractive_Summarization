@entity1 's footballing career has been hampered by a succession of injuries , but his modelling career is off to a flyer as campaign photos hit @entity8 's @entity7 on monday			1
the 25 - year - old @entity10 striker has not scored a @entity12 goal for over seven months , and is yet to play a match this season , but is having more luck when it comes to his off - field activities			1
@entity1 was chosen to front a @entity19 modelling campaign earlier this month after beating off competition from 200 other candidates , and has shown off a whole new set of skills since signing up with agency ' @entity24 '			2
@entity1 's @entity27 photo shows him on a billboard in @entity8 's @entity7 @entity1 returned to first - team training with @entity10 last thursday after an ankle injury in a photograph posted on his @entity27 account from @entity7 , @entity1 is seen wearing a simple black jumper , while spinning a football on his finger			1
but football is n't something he has seen a lot of in the past few months , not featuring for the @entity10 at all this season after suffering ankle ligament damage on the club 's pre-season tour of @entity43 in july			0
early reports stated that the @entity46 striker could be out until 2015 , but he is now expected to make a return as early as november 8 at home to @entity49 , following an injury to @entity51			0
the @entity53 - born striker has been a revelation for the east - @entity56 this season , scoring seven goals in his first seven starts , but he may have to pass the baton temporarily to @entity1 following a shoulder injury picked up on saturday			0

' we 'll try to get him through three or four behind - closed - doors games and if that goes alright , then we would hope to have him back ... hopefully when he gets back he 'll have a major impact			0
' and an impact is exactly what @entity1 will need to have , if @entity10 are to maintain their extraordinary start to the @entity12 season			2
they have won five of their first nine matches , and are unlikely occupants of a top - four position in the @entity12			0
@entity68 spoke of his want to involve @entity1 in practice matches before promoting him back to the first team , but given @entity51 's injury , the @entity10 manager 's hand may be forced to include him sooner than expected .			2
