forget the theory that men are from @entity2 and women from @entity4 – our brains are the same , an expert insists			2
neuroscientist professor @entity8 says the sexes are not ‘ hardwired ’ in different ways and there is no evidence that men are innately better at reading maps or that women are better at multi-tasking			1
any difference is due to society ’s idea of gender , not to biology , and is deterring a generation of women from becoming scientists , she warns			2
the scientist said the human brain is much more malleable than we think			2
she highlighted recent research which showed that women given a @entity61 console game to play for three months displayed fundamental changes in their brain structure			1
the @entity65 study found that women who regularly played the game - which involves manipulating shapes in a logical way - had grown part of their brain associated with spatial skills			1
it showed that the brain changes far more regularly than we think and is affected by stereotypes and attitudes – nurture not nature – all the way through life , she said			1
‘ if you just look at gender differences – and not their experiences in life – then , yes , you might find differences			0
but the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different			2
’ professor @entity8 , who will address the @entity88 in @entity46 on sunday , added : ‘ we really can not afford to sit back and accept the “ essentialist ” view that girls are not going to be interested in science subjects because of some “ brain deficiency ”			1
‘ we need more trained scientists and engineers but 50 per cent of our pool of talent is not engaging			0
‘ people who could study these subjects or do these jobs are choosing not to			2
‘ this must not be explained away by misguided and misleading explanations in terms of unchangeable biological characteristics , or references to “ the natural order of things ”			0
’ her views - for which she has been labelled a ‘ gender difference denier ’ - are contradicted by a prominent study published last year			0
the study , in which the brains of 949 young men and women were scanned at the @entity114 , suggested that women had better connections between the left and right - hand sides of the brain , while men had better links between the front and back			1
the authors claimed their findings demonstrated that women are better disposed to deal with ‘ analytical ’ and ‘ intuitive ’ tasks at the same time			0
men , meanwhile , were better at complex motor skills , they said			0
professor @entity8 dismissed the study as having neglected the idea that these changes were caused by nurture - not nature - and said there is no such thing as a ‘ hardwired ’ brain			1
‘ there is quite a lot of thoughtless science being done and quite a lot of overenthusiastic presenting			0
if you just look at gender differences - and not their experiences in life - then yes you might find differences			0
‘ but the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different			0

claims made by prof @entity8 of @entity45 in @entity46
she cited study showing women ' grew ' part of brain for spatial skills
the brain 's workings are dictated by stereotypes and attitudes , she said
