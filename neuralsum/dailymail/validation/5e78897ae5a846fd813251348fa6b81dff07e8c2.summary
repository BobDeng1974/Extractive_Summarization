@entity0 is set to captain wales for a record 34th time in the @entity4 showdown against @entity5 in @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity7 talks to @entity0 and @entity9 wing legend @entity8 about the game which could decide the @entity4			1
@entity7 : you 'll become @entity9 's most - capped captain on saturday			1
what 's the secret ? @entity0 : i take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago			1
@entity21 put his faith in me when i was quite young and he 's stuck with me			2
before i took up the role , some people said ' if someone 's out of line , then you have to give it to them '			2
rather than the @entity30 approach , and as a @entity32 fan , i like to compare myself to @entity33			0
@entity34 's @entity7 speaks to @entity9 captain @entity0 and former test winger @entity8 @entity0 ( left ) is set to captain wales for a record 34th time against @entity5 in @entity6 on saturday former @entity9 and @entity37 winger @entity8 believes his @entity0 's side are still in the running for the title @entity7 : @entity41 previously held the record , how do the two compare ? @entity8 : to be captain , you have to be well liked by the players			1
@entity0 came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me , so it was a little strange to have him as captain			1
but he impressed me straight away and , like @entity41 , he trained hard and played hard			1
@entity7 : wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to @entity54 in round one			1
are there shades of 2013 ? @entity0 : it 's going that way			1
our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it			0
it was tough then because all the @entity9 teams previously had won a @entity65			2
@entity41 sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed			1
we 've had our one lifeline but we 've got the motivation that it 's still possible			2
@entity8 : fate is always in your hands with the @entity4 , that 's what makes it special			1
it 's an open championship			1
@entity5 are favourites to win in @entity6 but you ca n't write anyone off — one result can change everything			1
@entity7 : @entity78 ran the show against @entity54			1
how much of a threat is he ? @entity0 : if i 'm being honest , i did n't see the game live because i was watching @entity32 v @entity83 in the @entity85 final			1
i flicked back and forth to see the rugby score			0
but @entity87 is a massive part of the @entity90 team			0
his attention to detail impressed me on the @entity37 tour and he knew every move so intricately			0
he deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world			0
@entity41 ( centre ) previously held the record for @entity9 's most - capped captain @entity7 : how do you defend against @entity78 and @entity103 's kicking game ? @entity8 : the game is changing and there 's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks			1
when i saw the state of @entity110 at the end last week , he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired			0
it helps being six - foot plus when you 're taking high balls			0
@entity117 is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air , running 40 yards , and catching it			2
it sounds easy but it 's such a big part of the game now			2
@entity7 : who would you select in the @entity126 back - three ? @entity8 : defensively , @entity127 is the best full back in the world			1
@entity130 is my first - choice winger because he 's such a talented footballer			2
on the other wing i would keep @entity134 , who 's the form player in @entity9			1
@entity135 and @entity136 were both very good in the pack against @entity138 — especially with the 100 per cent lineout — and i would n't make any changes for the weekend … if it is n't broken do n't fix it ! fly half @entity78 ( right ) has been superb for @entity5 during this years 's tournament @entity7 : can the @entity126 half - backs match the @entity146 ? @entity8 : i 've been very impressed with @entity117 and @entity147			1
they 've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games			2
it helps that they 've been together at @entity158 and they will have to be on top of their game against @entity103 and @entity78 , because they 're the world 's in - form combination			1
@entity7 : @entity54 were blitzed at the breakdown in @entity167 , are you putting extra focus on that area ? @entity0 : out of all the @entity4 teams i 've played against , @entity5 have been the most effective at the breakdown			1
i 've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as i was last year			0
i have n't made as many turnovers as i would have liked			0
the post-tackle stuff is always an add - on after training and @entity177 always barks at us when we 're doing it			0
it 's key to our game plan			2
@entity7 : @entity5 have lost just twice in @entity6 in 32 years , why are they so successful ? @entity8 : in the nicest possible way , they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game			1
they 've had players like @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , who have been able to win these kind of games			0
they have belief and mental toughness			0
when they 're playing well , they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop			0
@entity9 head coach @entity21 ( centre ) will be pitting his wits against fellow @entity203 @entity202 this week @entity7 : what 's the key to countering that record ? @entity0 : like every international match , there are three areas : set piece , breakdown , kicking game			1
if you can come out on top in two of those three then that 's probably going to be the key			2
i think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against @entity5			1
we 're back at our own little nest in the @entity224 and we 're back at home			0
after two wins , confidence is high			0
@entity7 : @entity21 vs @entity202 will be an interesting coaching battle — how do the two @entity229 compare ? @entity8 : they both stick to the game plan they want to play			2
@entity202 uses the players as a tool to work out how @entity5 are going to play , rather than trying to fit them into a certain game - plan			2
@entity21 's got a great way with people			2
he gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them			0
i used to come off the field and , with a glint in his eye , he would say ' oh you were rubbish today ! '			0
he loves the wind - up and he loves getting his players going			0
@entity202 is very straight down the line			0
he says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest			0
they 're different personalities but they 're both hugely successful			0
@entity9 winger @entity130 makes a strong carry during his side 's victory against @entity138 in @entity256 @entity7 : wales are still in the running … how much of a @entity261 confidence boost would it be to win the @entity4 ? @entity0 : i do n't think the @entity4 will have much bearing on the @entity261			1
in 2011 that was n't the case			0
the @entity4 did n't reflect our @entity261 campaign			0
last year 's autumn campaign finished well for us but that did n't transfer into the first game against @entity54			1
i do n't think there 's much of a trend with @entity9			0
the most important period will be the three months we 're together in the summer			0
we 'll treat that like a pre-season			0
@entity0 and @entity8 are ambassadors for @entity277 , @entity278			1
