at first glance , it resembles a giant rose , surrounded by green foliage			0
however , in fact this is a huge , violent storm of the surface of @entity7 - and one that has been brewing for years in high - resolution pictures and video , scientists say the hurricane 's eye is about 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers ) wide , 20 times larger than the average hurricane eye on @entity15			1
the spinning vortex of @entity7 's north polar storm resembles a deep red rose of giant proportions surrounded by green foliage in this false - color image from @entity24 's @entity23 spacecraft			2
measurements have sized the eye at a staggering 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers ) across with cloud speeds as fast as 330 miles per hour ( 150 meters per second )			1
both a hurricane on @entity15 and @entity7 's north polar vortex have a central eye with no clouds or very low clouds			1
other similar features include high clouds forming an eye wall , other high clouds spiraling around the eye , and a counter-clockwise spin in the northern hemisphere			0
a major difference between the hurricanes is that the one on @entity7 is much bigger than its counterparts on @entity15 and spins surprisingly fast			2
at @entity7 , the wind in the eye wall blows more than four times faster than hurricane - force winds on @entity15			1
unlike terrestrial hurricanes , which tend to move , the @entity7 hurricane is locked onto the planet 's north pole			2
on @entity15 , hurricanes tend to drift northward because of the forces acting on the fast swirls of wind as the planet rotates			1
@entity24 's @entity23 spacecraft has provided scientists the first close - up , visible - light views of a behemoth hurricane swirling around @entity7 's north pole			1
thin , bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane are traveling 330 mph ( 150 meters per second )			0
the hurricane swirls inside a large , mysterious , six - sided weather pattern known as the hexagon			1
' we did a double take when we saw this vortex because it looks so much like a hurricane on @entity15 , ' said @entity70 , a @entity23 imaging team member at the @entity72 in @entity73			1
' but there it is at @entity7 , on a much larger scale , and it is somehow getting by on the small amounts of water vapor in @entity7 's hydrogen atmosphere			2
' scientists will be studying the hurricane to gain insight into hurricanes on @entity15 , which feed off warm ocean water			1
although there is no body of water close to these clouds high in @entity7 's atmosphere , learning how these @entity7 storms use water vapor could tell scientists more about how terrestrial hurricanes are generated and sustained			0

the one on @entity7 does not drift and is already as far north as it can be			0
' the polar hurricane has nowhere else to go , and that 's likely why it 's stuck at the pole , ' said @entity124 , a @entity23 imaging team associate at @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 this spectacular , vertigo inducing , false - colour image from @entity24 's @entity23 mission highlights the storms at @entity7 's north pole			1
the mysterious six - sided hexagon is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles ( 30,000 km ) scientists believe the massive storm has been churning for years			1
when @entity23 arrived in the @entity7 system in 2004 , @entity7 's north pole was dark because the planet was in the middle of its north polar winter			0
during that time , the @entity23 's composite infrared spectrometer and visual and infrared mapping spectrometer detected a great vortex , but a visible - light view had to wait for the passing of the equinox in august 2009			0
only then did sunlight begin flooding @entity7 's northern hemisphere			0
the view required a change in the angle of @entity23 's orbits around @entity7 so the spacecraft could see the poles			0
' such a stunning and mesmerizing view of the hurricane - like storm at the north pole is only possible because @entity23 is on a sportier course , with orbits tilted to loop the spacecraft above and below @entity7 's equatorial plane , ' said @entity159 , @entity23 deputy project scientist at @entity24 's @entity160 in @entity73 , @entity161 ' you can not see the polar regions very well from an equatorial orbit			2
the north pole of @entity7 , in the fresh light of spring , is revealed in this color image from @entity24 's @entity23 spacecraft ' observing the planet from different vantage points reveals more about the cloud layers that cover the entirety of the planet			0
' @entity23 changes its orbital inclination for such an observing campaign only once every few years			0
because the spacecraft uses flybys of @entity7 's @entity180 to change the angle of its orbit , the inclined trajectories require attentive oversight from navigators			0
the path requires careful planning years in advance and sticking very precisely to the planned itinerary to ensure enough propellant is available for the spacecraft to reach future planned orbits and encounters .			0
