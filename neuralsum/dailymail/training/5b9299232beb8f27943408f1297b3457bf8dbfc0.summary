@entity1 - based airlines reported 17 animal fatalities and 26 injuries in 2014			1
of all the carriers , @entity4 reported the most deaths and injuries , while @entity8 boasted a record zero animal fatalities			1
the data was released by the @entity11 , as part of a larger compilation of operating information , in its @entity15			1
in 2014 , 17 animal fatalities and 26 pet injuries were reported by several @entity1 airlines most of the injuries reported involved dogs and cats that had been hurt as they attempted to escape from their cages			1
@entity25 - 3 deaths @entity1 - 3 deaths @entity28 - 4 deaths @entity30 - 2 deaths @entity8 - 0 deaths united - 5 deaths source : @entity11 many of the deaths were a result of the animals actually escaping from their transport cages and being hit by other vehicles at the airport			1
another major cause of death was underlying health conditions , such as dogs with short or snub noses , which were then aggravated by the stress of travelling			0
several airlines are currently reviewing their policies for those types of animals , such as pugs and @entity53 bulldogs			0

thus , they have a particularly high risk of suffocating in - flight			0
whenever possible , it is advised to purchase your pet a spot in the passenger cabin instead of cargo hold despite friendly staff and smooth air , animals travelling in the cargo hold of a commercial jet do face their fair share of environmental stresses , such as varying temperatures , loud noises and air pressure drops			2

and the total number of animal deaths seems to be declining			1
in 2011 , 35 pets died while travelling on @entity1 airlines and in 2012 , 29 pets died			2
between 2010 and 2013 , it was @entity28 reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths			1
however , @entity28 maintains that the reason for their higher numbers is simply because they carry more pets than any other competing airline			0
@entity28 is also very open about the lengthy precautions that taken to ensure animal safety on board , which includes not allowing pets to travel between may 15 and september 15 when temperatures my get too hot			0
they also reserve the right not to carry pets in the cargo hold during periods of extreme cold weather			0
good news , since nearly all animal incidents reported to the @entity11 involve pets in the cargo hold .			2
