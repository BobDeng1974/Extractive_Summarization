by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 18:57 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 18:58 est , 3 september 2013 charities and campaigning groups fear they could be hampered by new government plans designed to regulate lobbyists			1
ministers have drawn up rules which they say will make the links between politicians and big businesses more transparent			2
but the legislation was fiercely attacked by dozens of charities and think - tanks who say it will prevent legitimate campaigning			1
charities and campaigning groups say the new rules passed yesterday at the @entity18 will prevent legitimate campaigning the law would introduce a compulsory register of lobbyists for people working as independent consultants following scandals about attempts to influence government decision - making			1
but it would also brings in caps on the spending of non-political organisations during the year before an election			2
the rule , which is intended to target the power and funding leveraged by trade unions , means organisations will be able to spend only £ 390,000 nationally – down from £ 989,000			1
in individual constituencies they will see their spending during election year capped at just £ 9,750			2
the law managed to pass the @entity18 yesterday by 300 votes to 249			1
it is expected to face more difficulties in the @entity45			0
however former cabinet minister @entity46 told @entity47 that people who were fighting the @entity57 rail project ‘ firmly believe the @entity48 contains provisions that will inhibit their effectiveness in ensuring that their voice is heard by the government ’			0
@entity58 , campaign manager of @entity57 said : ‘ it ’s an absolute disaster			0
we feel we have been victims of our own success			0
former cabinet minister @entity46 told @entity47 that people fighting @entity63 believe the @entity48 will ' inhibit ' their voices being heard but @entity65 insisted charities could make their case ' as forcefully as they wish ' ' the government do n’t like what we have been saying so they want to make our activities illegal			2
campaign groups exist to change politicians opinions , so this could not be more against the principle of free speech , it ’s insane and rotten to the core			0
‘ this bill is in the name of clipping the wings of big money @entity81 and yet , because it only affects those whose major business is lobbying , lots of them will actually miss the bullet			0
’ @entity88 , the @entity89 mp for @entity90 , pointed out that important campaigns ‘ may only arise during an election campaign ’			0
and a group of major charities – including the @entity95 , @entity96 and the @entity97 – have signed a letter to ministers explaining their opposition to the new rules			1
but @entity102 insisted charities could make their case ‘ as forcefully as they wish ’ unless they were using money to try and ensure the election of particular candidates			0
and a @entity110 spokesman said : ‘ this bill will take the big money out of politics so you do n’t have unaccountable funding pouring into constituencies			1
it will not substantially change the rules for charities			1
