he is the boy from a quaint fishing town in @entity2 , but @entity3 could soon find himself as one of the most expensive defenders in @entity7 history			1
as @entity11 holds talks over the purchase of signings at @entity15 on friday afternoon , the name of the @entity10 defender will be raised			1
he is one of the most enthralling @entity17 players to watch , blending his modern day professionalism with spirit of eras gone by perfectly			1
he is a different kind of footballer , grateful for what he has but still holds ambition to play at the very top			0
his slick and stylish panache on and off the ball is all that @entity10 want in a player , but he is very much different off the pitch			2
there are aspects of @entity3 ’s life that are markedly different to the majority of his peers			2
firstly , he is exceptionally modest , humble and treats the business for what it is : a job , and one which requires serious devotion			0
the @entity51 turns up to @entity52 each day , works hard and then goes home			2
there are no airs and graces to him ; just a man born in a fishing town in @entity59			2
he has a long - term girlfriend , leads a settled life and is dedicated to his family			0
@entity3 ( left ) grew up in @entity59 in @entity2 , beginning his sporting life playing @entity64 he impressed for @entity65 , pictured ( left ) in march 2008 , enough to warrant a £ 60,000 move to @entity10 it was at @entity65 ( right ) that he impressed @entity10 scouts enough for them to bring him to @entity70 those , coupled with his fearless nature at right - back , is what appeals to @entity21 and why he is now one of the first names on the @entity10 sheet each week			1
the @entity77 saw something in @entity3 right from the off			2
on taking the job at @entity81 at the beginning of last season , @entity21 knew there was something to work with here			1
@entity3 had played the majority of the previous year and impressed by all accounts – his willingness to run up and down the right - hand touchline for 90 minutes an obvious appeal to the new boss			1
but , interestingly , @entity3 was n’t doing enough for @entity21			1
the criticism was that he ’d stop when he hit the final third – almost passing on the burden of responsibility to those in front of him			0
it could be construed as having been a cop - out , but @entity21 felt his man just needed a push , pulling him to one side at half - time of the very first game of 2013 - 14 , telling the defender he needed to start continuing his runs into the penalty area			1
so he did , and at breakneck speed			0
@entity3 is a buccaneering full - back not seen enough in the modern game			1
he is a player to excite the ground , get them up off their seats			0
that , in essence , is all @entity10 supporters want			2
he left @entity65 , where he is pictured ( right ) in may 2008 against @entity117 , at the age of 21 in 2009 , when he joined @entity10 , @entity3 had been playing for @entity121 's @entity120 side for two years he was given a chance at first - team action in 2010 when he was loaned to @entity124 in the championship and it is what the @entity124 fans of 2010 saw plenty of when @entity3 ’s career really kicked off during a loan spell on the @entity132 which ended in promotion to the @entity17			1
in april of that season , during an away win at @entity135 , @entity3 picked up the ball 35 yards out			2
he looked ahead and charged towards the home penalty area , weaving his way through @entity15 defenders and using attackers as decoys			0
the move finished in the youngster flicking in to the net and the whole of @entity147 rose as one to applaud a goal which ought to have adorned a stage far grander			0
he had come from nowhere			0
@entity10 signed him for £ 60,000 from @entity65 a the year previous but there were no opportunities to impress in the first team			1
the goal that made everyone turn and look at @entity3 came while on loan at @entity124 , against @entity135 @entity3 has now broken through to the @entity121 senior team , pictured at @entity158 in may 2013 @entity3 is known for his buccaneering runs from full - back , and is a mainstay in @entity10 's first team @entity124 , and winning the @entity125 play - off final at @entity158 , provided a springboard			1
he ’s taken it gleefully			0
the only blot is @entity3 ’s age			0
even though he is seen as someone still coming through , he is now 26			0
that is largely down to an injury picked up on a pre-season tour of @entity172 prior to his loan in the @entity125			0
the blister on his toe became infected – a small procedure becoming far larger and setting him back months			0
now he ’s making up for lost time , and it ’d be no surprise if @entity179 opens that sizeable chequebook and pays what the @entity10 demand for a man who epitomises the right balance of professionalism and flair			1
@entity3 heads home for the @entity10 against @entity188 in the @entity189 at @entity81 @entity3 wheels away in celebration after putting the ball past @entity193 for @entity10 in november 2013			1

@entity3 arrived at @entity10 in 2009 from @entity51 side @entity65
he grew up playing *gaelic* football in @entity59 in @entity2
@entity3 had a spell on loan at @entity124 , which he used as a *platform* to *success* - taking the @entity201 to the @entity17
at the beginning of @entity21 's time at @entity10 , he criticised the right back for not attacking enough *...* something he has now changed
now , @entity3 could be heading to @entity11 's @entity15
@entity15 chiefs to hold talks over @entity3 and @entity212 *transfers*
