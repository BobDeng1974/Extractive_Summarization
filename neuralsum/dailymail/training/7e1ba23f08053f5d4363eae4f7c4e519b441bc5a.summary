@entity1 ’s sight was saved by injections of the drugs @entity4 and @entity5			1
without them , the retired submarine captain would have lost his central vision — including his ability to recognise faces , drive , watch tv , or read books			0
both drugs stop the loss of central vision caused by age - related macular degeneration ( @entity18 ) , the leading cause of blindness			1
‘ the wet age - related macular degeneration ( @entity18 ) in my right eye was picked up shortly after i noticed problems with my sight			1
i had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones , said @entity1 , aged 71 the condition , which affects 500,000 people in the @entity30 , comes in two forms : the ‘ dry ’ form , which progresses slowly , and for which there is no treatment , and the ‘ wet ’ form , which affects one in ten @entity18 sufferers			1
the latter form is more rapid , and can rob a person of sight within weeks or even days			2
@entity18 , which @entity1 , 71 , was diagnosed with five years ago , develops when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula — the central part of the retina responsible for seeing fine details — and damage its cells			1
‘ the wet @entity18 in my right eye was picked up shortly after i noticed problems with my sight			2
' i had started seeing straight lines as wavy ones			0
' for instance , lampposts , road markings and window frames would all look like they had kinks , ’ says @entity1 , who lives in @entity54 , @entity55 , with his wife @entity56 , also 71			1
treatments for the condition — @entity5 , @entity4 and a newer drug called @entity60 — are injected directly into the eye			1
they help stop the growth of blood vessels in the eye , as well as preventing them from leaking , which helps to preserve and improve vision			0
since his diagnosis , @entity1 has had upwards of 24 injections of all three medications			1
‘ the sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal — i can still drive , play bridge and read , ’ he says			2
‘ the injections saved me from going blind			1
’ yet despite @entity5 and @entity4 being equally effective and safe , @entity4 is not widely available to patients			1
this is because it was originally devised as a cancer treatment , and so is not officially permitted to be used for @entity18 ( although it can be prescribed on a case - by - case basis , if the doctor accepts personal responsibility )			2
independent trials , the latest of which was published in the influential @entity82 , have deemed the treatment safe for @entity18			0
‘ the sight in my right eye has been restored to almost normal , ' said @entity1 yet the @entity86 watchdog , the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , has not approved the drug for use in @entity18 patients — because it has not been officially licensed for this use — instead recommending that doctors use @entity5 or @entity60			1
campaigners warn this is leaving patients without a treatment option , as the drug can be used in patients for whom @entity5 and @entity60 do n’t work			1
furthermore , not being allowed to use @entity4 means that the already cash - strapped @entity98 is having to spend a fortune on the other drugs needlessly			1
@entity5 costs around £ 700 per injection , while @entity4 is nearly eight times cheaper , at £ 90 per injection ( @entity60 is the most expensive at around £ 900 per injection )			1
each patient usually needs around 12 jabs in a lifetime			0
experts believe using @entity4 , which is just as effective , could free up funds for treatment for other patients			1
professor @entity111 , consultant ophthalmologist at @entity112 , says most macular patients are still given the more expensive @entity5 — which is costing the @entity98 an extra £ 102 million a year			1
‘ this could be better spent on delivering other treatments for patients , ’ he says			0
‘ at the moment , eye departments are so overstretched that they are struggling to see @entity18 patients in time for them to have their first injections , which should be given within two weeks			1
‘ patients are going blind waiting to be treated in some cases			0
’ however , professor @entity111 , who co-authored a piece in last week ’s @entity126 with the president of the @entity128 of @entity129 , which called for @entity4 to be made available on the @entity98 , says the issue is complex and steeped in red tape			1
although @entity4 is licensed for bowel , breast , kidney and lung cancers , it is n’t licensed for @entity18			1
doctors only began using @entity4 for @entity18 when they noticed that patients who were being treated for cancer reported their macular degeneration improved			1
it is up to the pharmaceutical company that manufactures @entity4 — @entity143 — to apply for a licence for @entity18 , but this would require further clinical trials			1
critics say that the firm has little commercial incentive to do this as , globally , it also manufactures the more expensive @entity5 ( though it is marketed by company @entity151 within the @entity152 )			1
indeed @entity143 and @entity151 were jointly fined € 182.5 million by the @entity153 for ‘ cartelising the sales of two major ophthalmic drugs ’ — although both of the companies have denied this and an appeal is pending			0
the authority said that the two companies ‘ colluded to exclude the cheap drug @entity4 to channel demand towards the most expensive drug , @entity5 ’			1
until @entity4 is licensed , @entity84 can not approve its use			2
when a drug is not officially licensed for a condition , doctors need to prescribe the treatment ‘ off - label ’			0
however , professor @entity111 says the @entity172 ( @entity172 ) states doctors should not use an unlicensed treatment where a licensed one exists			0
the cash - strapped @entity98 is having to spend a fortune on the other drugs needlessly ‘ doctors risk personal liability and , technically , could even be struck off , or sued by a patient , if they use it , ’ he warns			2
‘ we want the @entity184 to apply for a licence for @entity4			2
‘ there is n’t a precedent for this , but we would argue this is an exceptional case and the evidence is there to support this drug ’s safety and effectiveness			0
@entity84 could then consider if this should be a recommended treatment			0
‘ failing that , the @entity172 should indicate doctors will not face misconduct charges if they prescribe @entity4			2
we need some leadership from the @entity184 and @entity172 on this			0
’ the @entity199 charity is also calling for @entity84 to assess whether @entity4 can be used for @entity18			2
and @entity200 , professor of bioethics at the @entity202 , says it is ‘ arguably immoral and unethical not to use @entity4 ’			2
‘ there seems to be no reason at all why the @entity98 should not use @entity4 in preference to @entity5 , ’ he says			1
a @entity143 spokeswoman confirmed the company has no plans to apply for a licence for @entity4 to treat macular conditions or other eye conditions			1
a @entity151 spokeswoman said : ‘ as it is not a @entity151 medicine , we are not in a position to comment on it			0
’ while the bureaucratic battles rage on , patients who suffer from other rarer eye conditions that also affect central vision , such as @entity219 , 30 , are facing a fight to get any treatment with @entity4 on the @entity98 at all			1
@entity219 — who lives in @entity223 , @entity224 , with her partner , @entity226 , 33 , and their son , @entity227 , 22 months — suffers from punctate inner choroidopathy ( @entity230 ) , a rare eye condition , which can also cause loss of central vision and blind spots			0
‘ i first noticed i had a problem with my sight when i closed one of my eyes when applying eyeliner , ’ says @entity219			0
‘ i realised that there was a big dot blocking the centre of my vision in my right eye			0
’ doctors told @entity219 she needed injections into her eye straight away — or would go blind within six months			0
‘ to make matters worse , i was told that @entity4 , the treatment that could help , was not available on the @entity98 , as the drug was n’t licensed to treat this condition , ’ she says			2
even if she could find a doctor who would prescribe the treatment off - label , @entity219 says ‘ the cost of having each injection privately would be £ 600 to £ 1,000 ’			0
‘ i did n’t have the money			0
the local @entity257 ( @entity258 ) turned down my application for funding , saying it was n’t a licensed treatment			0
’ after @entity219 ’s local paper ran a story about her plight , the local @entity258 agreed to pay for the first injection			0
‘ i ’ve since needed four more injections , ’ she says			0
‘ but , each time , i ’ve had to apply to the @entity258 again — it ’s maddening			0
@entity4 needs to be licensed for eye conditions			2
’ @entity1 echoes her frustration			2
‘ the money saved could be invested into finding new treatments for other eye conditions , ’ he says			0
‘ we need to use some common sense here			0
