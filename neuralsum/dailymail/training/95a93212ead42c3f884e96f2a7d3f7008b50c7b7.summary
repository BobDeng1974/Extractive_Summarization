by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 13:00 est , 30 august 2012 hero : @entity2 infiltrated @entity3 to chronicle @entity5 atrocities			1
he survived nearly three years as an inmate in the death camp , before making a daring escape			1
but he was later executed it could hardly have been a riskier mission - to infiltrate @entity3 and chronicle @entity5 atrocities			2
@entity2 survived nearly three years as an inmate in the death camp , managing to smuggle out word of executions before making a daring escape			1
but the @entity17 resistance hero was crushed by the post-war communist regime tried on trumped - up charges and executed			1
six decades on , @entity17 hopes @entity2 's remains will be identified among the entangled skeletons and shattered skulls of resistance fighters being excavated from a mass grave on the edge of @entity27 's @entity26			1
the exhumations are part of a movement in the resurgent , democratic nation to officially recognize its war - time heroes and 20th century tragedies			0
' he was unique in the world , ' said @entity36 , paying tribute to her father 's 1940 decision to walk straight into a @entity5 street roundup with the aim of getting inside the extermination camp			2
' i would like to have a place where i can light a candle for him			0
' more than 100 skeletons , mostly of men , have been dug up this summer			0
on one recent day , forensic workers and archaeologists wearing blue plastic gloves and masks were carefully scraping away at the soil and piecing together bones as if working on a jigsaw puzzle			0
the front of one skull had been blown away by bullets ; another had apparently been bludgeoned ; a skeleton showed evidence of multiple gunshot wounds			0
near the pit where the bodies were dumped under cover of night stand the well - tended tombstones of the very judges and prosecutors who sent these @entity70 heroes to their deaths under orders from @entity73 , which was fearful that the @entity17 patriots might use their seasoned underground skills to turn the nation against its new @entity78 rulers			2
held : in this photo taken in 1940 , @entity2 is seen as an inmate of the @entity3 death camp discovery : @entity17 now hopes @entity2 's remains will be identified among the skeletons of resistance fighters currently being excavated from a mass grave on the edge of @entity27 's @entity26 ' the perpetrators have not been punished and the bodies of the victims have not been found , ' said @entity91 , a historian in charge of the dig. ' those times will be coming back to us until we find the bodies and bury them with due honors			1
' we are doing them justice			0
' @entity2 's son @entity100 and dozens of other relatives of victims have been swabbed in the hope their dna will be a match for the skeletons			1
initial work is being carried out to determine age , sex , height and injuries of the victims			0
it will take several months to determine if @entity2 , who was killed by a bullet to the back of his head , is among them			2
thousands of resistance fighters were killed across @entity17 ; the remains of up to 400 are believed to have been dumped in the @entity26 mass grave			1
@entity2 was 38 when @entity122 invaded @entity17 on september 1 , 1939 , triggering the start of @entity70 he helped organize a resistance campaign during which many fellow fighters were caught and sent to @entity3 , which in the early war years served more as a camp for @entity17 resistance fighters than @entity129			1
@entity130 : more than 100 skeletons , mostly of men , have already been dug up this summer			0
in this photo an archeologist uncovers a skeleton during works at the cemetery patience : a forensic worker sorts through bones during work at the cemetery			0
it will take several months to determine if @entity2 , who was killed by a bullet to the back of his head , is among them that inspired him to hatch an audacious plan : he told other resistance commanders that he wanted to become an @entity3 inmate to check on rumors of atrocities			1
carrying documents bearing the alias @entity155 , the catholic cavalry officer walked into the @entity122 ss street roundup in @entity27 in september 1940 , and was put on a train transport to @entity3 , where he was given prisoner number 4859			2
he was ' exceptionally courageous , ' said @entity160 , a historian with @entity27 's @entity161			2
@entity2 is the only person known to have volunteered for @entity3			2
his terse dispatches to the outside world were slips of thin paper stitched inside clothes of inmates leaving the camp or left in nearby fields for others to collect			0
they included only code names for inmates who were beaten to death , executed by gunfire or gassed			2
as sketchy as they were , they were the first eyewitness account of the @entity5 death machine at @entity3			0
@entity2 survived hard labor , beatings , cold and typhoid fever thanks to support from a clandestine resistance network that he managed to organize inside the camp			1
some of its members had access to food , others to clothes or medicines			0
past : the exhumations are part of a movement in the resurgent , democratic @entity17 to officially recognize its war - time heroes and 20th century tragedies remembrance : @entity36 , daughter of @entity2 , attends a ceremony marking the archeological work at the @entity26 cemetery he plotted a revolt that was to release inmates with the help of an outside attack by resistance fighters ; it was never attempted because considered too risky , @entity160 said			1
@entity2 escaped in april 1943 when he realized that the @entity206 might uncover his work			0
with two other men he ran from a night shift at a bakery that was outside the death camp 's barbed wire fence			1
after his escape , @entity2 wrote three detailed reports on the extermination camp			1
one describes how his transport was met by yelling @entity206 men and attacking dogs : ' they told one of us to run to a post away from the road , and immediately sent a machine gun round after him			0
' ten random colleagues were taken out of the group and shot , as they were walking , as " collective responsibility " for the " escape " that the ss - men arranged themselves			0
' difficult : a forensic worker cleans a skull during the excavation @entity2 's heroics were for the most part in vain			1
even though his accounts of gas chambers made it all the way to @entity17 's government - in - exile in @entity240 and to other @entity242 capitals , few believed what they were reading			1
after escaping , @entity2 rejoined @entity17 's @entity246 resistance force and fought in the 1944 @entity247 , the city 's ill - fated revolt against the @entity249			1
in 1947 , he was arrested by the secret security of the communist regime , imposed on @entity17 after the war , and falsely accused of planning to assassinate dignitaries			1
the @entity255 plan after @entity70 was to subdue the @entity17 by crushing resistance and erasing any sense of @entity17 identity or history			2
today , more than two decades into @entity17 's democracy , however , enough documentation and funds have been gathered to restore the banned past and try to find and identify the heroes ' bodies			2
in addition to @entity2 , the search is on for the remains of other wartime resistance heroes , including @entity270			1
gen. august @entity271 , a top clandestine @entity246 commander who once served as emissary to @entity17 of the country 's government - in - exile			2
he was accused of ordering killings of @entity255 soldiers charges that @entity17 's communist authorities later admitted were fabricated and hanged in 1953			1
@entity278 is not sure if @entity2 will be found at @entity279 because it is not the only such clandestine site in @entity27 or the rest of @entity17			1
respect : soldiers and scouts stand in front of coffins containing remains of @entity70 heroes during a ceremony ending the archeological works at the @entity26 cemetery but his place in history is gradually being restored			0
a street in @entity27 is now named after him , as are some schools across the country			0
he found communist prison harder to endure than @entity3			0
a fellow inmate described seeing him in prison slumped , unable to raise his head because his collar bones had been broken			0
at his show trial , he was hiding his hands because his fingernails had been ripped out during torture			0
at one court session , he told his wife @entity307 that the secret security torture had sapped his will to go on			0
' i can live no longer , ' he said .			0
