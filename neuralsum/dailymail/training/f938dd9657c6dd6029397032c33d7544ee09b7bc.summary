by @entity0 last updated at 9:41 am on 31st january 2012 four huge volcanic eruptions triggered a ' @entity2 ' that cooled earth for hundreds of years until the late 19th century , say scientists			1
the period of cooling led to famous events such as people ice skating on the @entity10			1
a study at the @entity12 analysed sediment cores , vegetation and ice , and revealed that four massive tropical volcanic eruptions between 1275 and @entity16 triggered the period of cooling			1
scientist @entity17 collects vegetation samples on @entity19			2
the scientists analysed sediment , vegetation and ice samples to make their conclusions the scientists also used powerful computer climate modelling to confirm their results			1
‘ this is the first time anyone has clearly identified the specific onset of the cold times marking the start of the @entity2 , ’ says lead author @entity28 of the @entity12			1
‘ we also have provided an understandable climate feedback system that explains how this cold period could be sustained for a long period of time			1
' ' if the climate system is hit again and again by cold conditions over a relatively short period - in this case , from volcanic eruptions - there appears to be a cumulative cooling effect			2
’ a chromolithograph @entity45 card from 1865 showing the frozen @entity10 : scientists now believe that the prolonged period of cooling was caused by four tropical volcanic eruptions ‘ our simulations showed that the volcanic eruptions may have had a profound cooling effect , ’ says @entity51 scientist @entity50 , a co-author of the study			1
‘ the eruptions could have triggered a chain reaction , affecting sea ice and ocean currents in a way that lowered temperatures for centuries			0
’ the study appears this week in @entity63			0
scientific estimates regarding the onset of the @entity2 range from the 13th century to the 16th century			2
although the cooling temperatures may have affected places as far away as @entity69 and @entity70 , they were particularly evident in northern @entity71			2
advancing glaciers in mountain valleys destroyed towns , and paintings from the period depict people ice - skating on the @entity10 in @entity78 and canals in the @entity80 , places that were ice - free before and after the @entity2			1
‘ the dominant way scientists have defined the @entity2 is by the expansion of big valley glaciers in the @entity87 and in @entity88 , ’ says @entity28 , a fellow at @entity12 ’s @entity82			1
‘ but the time in which @entity71 glaciers advanced far enough to demolish villages would have been long after the onset of the cold period			2
’ @entity28 and his colleagues radiocarbon - dated roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact , collected from beneath receding margins of ice caps on @entity19 in the @entity100			0
they found a large cluster of ‘ kill dates ’ between 1275 and 1300 a.d. , indicating the plants had been frozen and engulfed by ice during a relatively sudden event			0
the team saw a second spike in plant kill dates at about 1450 a.d. , indicating the quick onset of a second major cooling event.tthe researchers also analysed sediment cores from a glacial lake linked to the 367 - square - mile @entity115 ice cap in the central highlands of @entity117 that reaches nearly a mile high			1
the annual layers in the cores -- which can be reliably dated by using deposits from known historic volcanic eruptions on @entity117 going back more than 1,000 years -- suddenly became thicker in the late 13th century and again in the 15th century due to increased erosion caused by the expansion of the ice cap as the climate cooled			0
‘ that showed us the signal we got from @entity19 was not just a local signal , it was a @entity131 signal , ’ @entity28 says			0
‘ this gave us a great deal more confidence that there was a major perturbation to the @entity138 climate near the end of the 13th century			0
’ the team used the @entity141 to simulate the effects of volcanic cooling on @entity100 sea ice extent and mass. t the model , which simulated various sea ice conditions from about 1150 to 1700 a.d. , showed several large , closely spaced eruptions could have cooled the @entity138 enough to trigger the expansion of @entity100 sea @entity151 model showed that sustained cooling from volcanoes would have sent some of the expanding @entity100 sea ice down along the eastern coast of @entity158 until it eventually melted in the @entity131			0
since sea ice contains almost no salt , when it melted the surface water became less dense , preventing it from mixing with deeper @entity131 water			0
this weakened heat going back to the @entity100 and created a self - sustaining cycle that sustained the sea ice long after the effects of the volcanic aerosols subsided , according to the simulations .			0

scientists analysed sediment and vegetation to confirm start of ' @entity2 '
first time anyone has marked start of period of cooling
