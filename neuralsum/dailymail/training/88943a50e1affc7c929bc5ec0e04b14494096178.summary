by @entity0 getting caught anywhere remotely close to the site of a natural disaster would be a nightmare for most people			0
but getting up close and personal with mother nature at her destructive worst is a dream for one avid photographer			0
@entity10 has spent the last decade travelling the length and breadth of the earth to take these incredible pictures of some of the world 's fiercest volcanoes violently erupting			1
he has spent a decade travelling the globe trying to snap the most dramatic pictures of violent volcanic eruptions violent : the @entity24 in @entity25 , pictured here , is a notoriously unpredictable volcano			0
one of his pictures of the volcano was a @entity31 picture of the day earlier this year stormy : scientists are uncertain as to why lightning occurs during some eruptions			2
one theory is that it is caused by charge - inducing collisions in volcanic dust daredevil : @entity10 pictured taking photographs at @entity40 , @entity41 the 49 - year - old has risked life and limb to get as close as he can to erupting volcanoes in places like @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
he takes time out of his day job as an engineer to travel thousands of miles at the drop of a hat and has got so close to the action that he has burnt his skin with hot lava in the past and even passed out because of their poisonous gases			0
mr @entity10 said : ' one has to know when it is safe to come near and when it is a matter of survival to stay away , sometimes many miles away			2
' a great deal of planning goes into mr @entity10 's expeditions			1
he tries to catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity , but calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to complete			2
feeling hot : streaks of lava are pictured on @entity78 , @entity79			0
it last seriously erupted in 2002 though it is still active nature 's show : the avid photographer captured this stunning image of lava spewing from the @entity86 , in @entity49 dangerous : a river of lava flows down the @entity89 , in @entity48			1
to capture distant volcanoes , @entity10 needs to set aside two weeks live wire : @entity92 spills from the top of @entity94 in @entity49			1
the volcano has been in almost continuous eruption for the last 2,000 years incredible : this impressive shot of @entity99 looks more like a firework than an act of nature hot stuff : a lava pool bubbles over violently at @entity105 in @entity106			1
@entity10 's fascination with volcanoes began when he saw @entity105 erupt as a child @entity110 : an amazing image of the @entity24 , in @entity25			1
he tries to catch volcanoes when they are their highest levels of activity , but calculating the ups and downs of the eruptions can take days to complete he has to put aside a fortnight if he hopes to get some good shots of volcanoes further afield			2
the @entity123 photographer said each volcano requires a different approach			0
he gives active stratovolcanos a wider berth as they can throw out lava bombs that travel several miles and create pyroclastic flows			0
these flows are currents of hot gas and rock that reach temperatures of @entity135 and travel up to @entity136			0
such a deadly surge destroyed @entity138 in @entity139			0
globe - trotter : streams of lava are pictured pouring out of the @entity94 volcano			2
@entity10 has trekked to volcanoes all around the world including ones in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 drama : the @entity149 volcano , in @entity50 , pictured erupting in 2010 , when it caused travel chaos with flights grounded by a resultant giant ash cloud eruption : this picture of the @entity89 volcano , in @entity48 , looks almost like a work of art rather than a dramatic picture of a volcanic eruption fiery : smoke billows from boiling hot lava at the top of @entity78 , @entity79 natural light : a stunning picture of @entity50 's @entity165 erupting at dusk back in 2010 however , ' red volcanoes ' create meandering lava flows and pyrotechnic displays that can be viewed from relatively nearby			1
the magma wells up to form new land in the sea , such as @entity173 on @entity174			0
his fascination with volcanoes began as a young boy when he witnessed @entity105 erupt in @entity106			1
' i feel like i 'm watching @entity181 's natural fireworks , ' he said			0
active : a plume of smoke billows from the @entity20 volcano in @entity25 which has been erupting almost constantly since 1955 beautiful : this photo from december 2009 , shows a glowing lava pond inside the summit crater of the @entity191 volcano in @entity47			2
the full moon can be seen behind in the early morning dawn cautious : the 49 - year - old photographer says that each volcano requires a different approach with some of the more violent eruptions needing a wider berth than some others patience : @entity10 pictured waiting at a safe vantage point for some action at @entity204 in @entity205 protection : @entity10 often has to wear a gas mask and protective clothing at the site of a volcano and has been burnt by hot lava and passed out due to the gasses in the past			1

@entity10 has been to countries including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 to photograph volcanoes
the 49 - year - old 's fascination with volcanoes began as a child when he witnessed @entity106 's @entity105 erupting
