what was supposed to be a day spent visiting a famous earthwork sculpture soon turned into a massive rescue effort as 20 strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog out of a tar pit			1
with no cell phone reception to call for help , owner @entity7 had to leave his dog @entity11 stuck in a pool by the @entity14 's @entity13 and drive an hour out to the nearest town			1
but , lucky for @entity7 , a family was willing to stay with @entity11 - and only more and more strangers followed as they heard his story			1
and at first the situation looked ' pretty hopeless ' , according to @entity40 , whose family stayed with the dog			0
' i was pretty sure that the back legs , the way they were positioned , they were going to snap right where the knee was , ' said @entity40 's daughter @entity49			0
@entity50 , a @entity37 reporter who was supposed to shoot video of the @entity13 that day , said only @entity11 's head was visible from the pit			1
he thought the dog was dying			0
but then a family who was visiting the shoreline with a photography group came over to help			0
and a huge group of friends from @entity38 jumped in as well			0
as more people came , they began bringing items to try and help get @entity11 out , using grocery bags , car floor mats , tarp , garbage bags , a straw hat and even bare hands			2
with no cell phone reception to call for help , owner @entity7 had to leave his dog @entity11 stuck by the @entity14 's @entity13 and drive an hour out to the nearest town but the group was able to separate the dog from the tar , piece by piece , as they continued to put objects in to pit to keep @entity11 from getting stuck again or from continuing to sink lower into the pool of tar @entity11 still could n't move after he was freed from the pits , so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that @entity7 had come back just in time @entity40 said that as they separated the dog from the tar piece by piece , they would continue putting objects in the pit to keep @entity11 from getting stuck again or continuing to sink			1
according to @entity50 , no one in the newly - formed group ' knew exactly what to do ' , but they worked for over an hour together to find a way to get @entity11 out			2
' total strangers talked , and worked , shoulder to shoulder , and figured it out , ' he wrote in an exclusive for @entity37 @entity38			0
' they did n't know each other â€™s names , and they did n't care			0
they ruined their clothes , they interrupted their plans , and they made a memory to last a lifetime			0
and yes , they saved @entity11			2
' @entity11 still could n't move after he was freed from the pit , so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that @entity7 had come back just in time			2
