by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 13 september 2013 a vicar has stopped serving wine during holy communion because of the growing number of alcoholics in his congregation			1
the reverend @entity7 said he did n’t want the ‘ four or five ’ addicts who attend his church to feel isolated during his services			1
he took the unorthodox step for the first time last sunday , using grape juice instead of red wine for everyone			1
the reverend @entity7 started serving grape juice at @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , last week he decided against using separate wine and non-wine chalices because he wanted everyone in his 70 - strong congregation to feel they were ' together ' during communion			1
mr @entity7 , vicar at @entity16 and @entity26 in @entity18 , @entity19 , said : ' this is a very new thing for us and quite rare in the @entity29			1
' i did n’t feel like it was fair that some of our congregation may feel excluded from everybody else			2
' the feedback has been positive so far			0
people feel like they are doing something to help others			2
' to go from a strong communion wine to grape juice has been a bit of a shock for some of my congregation , but we want to be in communion , we want people to come together with us			1
' mr @entity7 , 55 , has been at the small village church for four years and has seen his congregation grow			1
altar wine has been served in churches for centuries but mr @entity7 stopped after talking to a local rehab centre his action has been prompted by the church ’s close association with the @entity58 , which runs a nearby rehab centre			1
the @entity29 ’s @entity60 states that the drink used for communion should be ' ...			0
wine , the fermented juice of the grape , good and wholesome '			2
a @entity29 spokesman said there was nothing wrong with mr @entity7 's decision to not serve alcoholic wine , but said that official advice suggests it should be fermented first and then have the alcohol removed afterwards			1
mr @entity7 admitted that some of his congregation had voiced concerns that his changes had devalued the communion			1
but the vicar , who was ordained in 1997 after a career in industry , argued that @entity79 would want to make everyone feel welcome			2
he added : ' some of my congregation have quite a devout ideology and i have spoken to a few who i thought might have a problem			0
' they asked me " why ca n’t they just drink from a separate cup ? " and i asked them what they thought about drinking from a separate cup themselves			0
' their response was that they would feel isolated and that sort of proved my point			0
' there is the argument that @entity79 used wine to deliver his communion , but my faith tells me that if @entity79 was here he would want to make everybody feel welcome			0
' wine has been served at @entity106 services for more than 2,000 years , but some churches disapprove of the consumption of alcohol and serve non-alcoholic wine or juice instead			0
@entity112 : usually serves non-alcoholic wine at services in the @entity115			0
a spokesman told @entity117 : ' we are committed to church being a safe space for people , and one way is by ensuring they do n't encounter alcohol			0
' @entity125 : usually serves grape juice at communion			2
@entity128 : always serves ( alcoholic ) wine at communion			0
a spokesman said : ' there are very clear directions on this and the wine must be pure , unadulterated and straightforward , as it has been for more than 2,000 years			0

the reverend @entity7 says he has ' four or five ' *recovering* alcoholics in congregation at the @entity138 and @entity26 in @entity18 , @entity19
the 55 - year - old vicar chose not to have separate chalices as he did n't want anyone to feel left out
mr @entity7 *introduced* the grape juice at last sunday 's service and said it was ' a bit of a shock ' for some people
