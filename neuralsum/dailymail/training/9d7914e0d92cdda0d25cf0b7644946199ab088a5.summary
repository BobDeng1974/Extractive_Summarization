radiation from a stricken @entity2 nuclear power station could have reached a potentially lethal point - prompting fears that its operator is struggling to maintain safety			1
radiation readings of 1,800 millisieverts ( msv ) per hour - 18 times the level at the same spot 10 days ago - have been detected at the @entity10			1
a dose this size of gamma radiation is high enough to kill a human exposed to it within four hours			1
the revelations come after @entity2 's top nuclear regulator today raised safety concerns about hastily built storage tanks and their foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation - contaminated water			1
worrying : radiation from a @entity2 nuclear power station could have reached a potentially lethal point			1
this image shows @entity27 , @entity28 and industry minister @entity29 , in red helmet , inspecting contamination water tanks at @entity10 last week concerns : @entity2 's top nuclear regulator raised safety concerns today about hastily built storage tanks and their foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation - contaminated water @entity38 chairman @entity37 said that a small leak and signs of possible leaks have been spotted at several other @entity10 storage tanks since a major leak in august which added to concerns about the plant 's stability			1
the new revelations will add to the increasing anger in @entity2 over the management of the disaster by the owner of the plant , @entity52			1
there are increasing fears that news of more leaks from the plant could affect @entity58 's bid for the @entity59 which will be decided next saturday			2
a meeting about the leaks was postponed by @entity2 mps last week until after the decision by the @entity64 was to be made			2
this has prompted allegations of a cover - up			0
following the latest worrying radiation readings , @entity52 claimed last night that the radiation contained only @entity71 of gamma rays , the @entity68 reported			1
the firm said beta radiation , which is weaker , made up the rest of the radiation readings			1
wrecked : this aerial view shows the @entity78 in 2011 but dr @entity79 , a professor at @entity80 , told the newspaper that ratio would be ' most unusual ' , adding : ' penetrating gamma rays would be lethal in a few hours			1
' the plant 's operator reported a loss of 300 tons of radiation - contaminated water from a steel tank on august 19 , saying most of it is believed to have seeped underground but some might have escaped into the sea			2
the company has yet to determine the cause or exactly where the water went			0
the massive leak of water used to cool the plant 's three melted reactor cores triggered fears of similar leaks from more than 300 other similar tanks			2
the tanks are part of approximately 1,000 tanks holding 330,000 tons of contaminated water at the plant , where the radioactive waste water from the reactors grows by 400 tons daily			0
dangerous : workers spray water to cool down the spent nuclear fuel in the fourth reactor building at @entity10 in 2011 the latest leaks have triggered further concerns about the plant 's ability to manage the contaminated water			0
experts have said that radiation - contaminated water leaking from underground and utility tunnels connected to reactors and turbine buildings has been leaking into the sea for some time			0
@entity37 said he believed the discoveries of the subsequent leak and signs of possible leaks were the result of closer inspections after a leak two weeks ago			0
that leak was the worst from a tank at the plant , where three reactors melted down following the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami			0
@entity37 raised concerns about the safety of the foundations of the tank sites			0
@entity52 recently revealed that one of the tank sites had partially sunk during a test to see if the tank was watertight			0
' because those tanks were built in an emergency situation , it is questionable whether sufficient ground surveys were conducted , ' @entity37 said			0
' we believe experienced companies did a fine job , but we still have concerns and we must step up our watch for leaks			0
' the plant 's operator says the latest small leak was found over the weekend at a connecting pipe , and added it suspects possible leaks from at least three other tanks where high radioactivity was detected nearby , although it was not considered deadly			2
the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity2 destroyed the plant 's power and cooling systems , causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat			1
since then , the plant is now using makeshift systems .			0

radiation readings of 1,800 millisieverts per hour detected at power plant
this is 18 times the level at the same spot 10 days ago
leading professor says this ratio is ' most unusual ' and ' lethal in a few hours '
this adds to increasing anger in @entity2 over the management of disaster
