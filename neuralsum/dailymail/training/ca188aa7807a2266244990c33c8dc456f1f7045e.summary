@entity0 and @entity1 are set to go head - to - head in the january transfer window as both clubs seeks to bolster their strike force for the second half of the season with @entity9 @entity8 at the top of both clubs wish lists			1
as revealed in @entity14 last month @entity13 have put several @entity16 clubs on alert with the news that striker @entity8 is up for grabs for a fee in the region of £ 30million			1
although @entity1 insist @entity23 will not be put on offer in january , the @entity22 are in the market for a new striker			1
@entity9 striker @entity8 is a target for both @entity1 and @entity0 @entity8 could be available for £ 30m if he were to leave @entity13 @entity8 is one under consideration , as is @entity31 ’s @entity30 , whom the @entity31 will try and get £ 25 million - plus for			1
likewise @entity8 and @entity30 are on @entity0 ’s radar			2
@entity31 's @entity30 is also a target for both @entity1 and @entity0 @entity0 could use striker @entity34 as part of the deal to sign a striker in january spurs may be able to do a deal with @entity13 whereby they only pay £ 20million in a deal that sees @entity41 go the other way , although part exchange deals are always hard to finalise especially mid-season			1
that said @entity1 , despite saying he will stay , could try and do a deal with @entity47 which would see @entity23 return to @entity49 and the @entity22 sign £ 30million rated striker @entity50			1
@entity51 have targeted their next ‘ @entity55 ’ signing , @entity54 ’s @entity53			1
that is likely to scupper @entity58 ’s hopes of luring the @entity60 midfielder to @entity61 in january			1
our @entity51 source told the @entity14 : ‘ there is talk of @entity58 wanting @entity53 and for sure he will leave @entity60			1
@entity66 want him too … but he is the player @entity51 want next summer , or even in january			1
and the club is confident of getting him			0
they normally do get their target ’ @entity60 's @entity53 is a target for @entity51 @entity70 international @entity53 is wanted by a number of top clubs in @entity73 but @entity51 seem to lead the way the proposed arrival of @entity53 at @entity51 though confirms the departure of fellow @entity70 @entity77			1
we are told that could then mean @entity58 making a move for @entity77 , who has long been a target for both @entity82 and @entity83			1
if @entity51 do sign @entity53 then it could mean @entity77 is sold to @entity58 @entity58 also believe they will be able to outbid @entity82 in the pursuit of another @entity60 player - centre half @entity87			1
@entity88 could yet secure a move from @entity90 to @entity1 in january despite hysterical red top front page headlines with regard to an alleged driving offence			1
@entity90 's @entity88 could move to @entity1 in january @entity94 is set to quit @entity0 in january			1
@entity1 could move in for the @entity96 international who can play as a centre half or at left back			1
@entity94 could be heading for the exit door at @entity0 in january and could head to @entity1 @entity31 are poised to make a move for @entity101 ’s out of favour midfielder @entity102			1
@entity102 has failed to settle at the @entity101 since his £ 10.75m from @entity103 in 2012			0
but the @entity31 would not want to pay more than £ 5m for the player			0
@entity101 's @entity102 could be a target for @entity106 @entity82 are ready to send @entity107 out on loan in january			1
there will be plenty of interest in the @entity113 forward , with @entity114 being one possible destination			0
@entity107 could be sent out on loan by @entity82 with @entity114 one of the possible destinations i am hearing : while sir @entity121 will maintain his public support for @entity58 and genuinely rates @entity123 as a coach , i hear that the former @entity61 boss is rather bemused at the club suddenly adopting a spendthrift approach in the transfer market			2
he is wondering whether over a quarter of centuries worth of canny work under him that made the club the commercial giant it has become could be undermined as a consequence of seeking quick fix and expensive solutions			0
sir @entity121 is said to be bemused by @entity58 's high spending in the transfer window i am also hearing : @entity140 is torn between spending the next two years at @entity1 or ending his playing career with a completely new experience			1
@entity140 has told his @entity144 bosses that he wo n’t be rushed into signing the new two - year contract on much reduced terms which he was offered last week			0
@entity140 is considering his options before deciding where to end his career several @entity151 clubs are interested in @entity140 as are @entity153 club @entity152			0
and former @entity1 boss @entity154 would be interested in taking @entity140 to @entity47			2
and another @entity156 club , @entity155 , are also interested			0
@entity140 is free to talk to overseas clubs and agree a pre-contract next month			0
@entity82 boss @entity158 has suggested he is set to spend £ 20 million in january			2
but if the @entity160 lose out to @entity58 in the race for @entity60 ’s @entity87 then they will have to pay £ 37 million for @entity163 ’s @entity162			2
last week though , @entity158 confirmed another @entity14 exclusive that the @entity160 are set to offer £ 8m for @entity166 defender @entity165			0
@entity60 defender @entity87 is a target for @entity82 boss @entity158 @entity168 is set raid former club @entity58 to bolster the squad of new club @entity171			1
@entity172 is a target for @entity174 and may be too expensive , but @entity168 could try and sign him on a loan deal			2
@entity154 , @entity176 and @entity177 are also under consideration			0
@entity168 could try and convince @entity172 to join him at @entity171 on loan @entity180 believes @entity70 midfielder and @entity184 winner @entity182 rather than @entity185 should be named world player of the year			0
but it is @entity70 keeper @entity188 who is three man short list along with red hot favourite @entity185 and @entity192			0
@entity180 says : ‘ all the @entity195 nominees are wonderful footballers , but it ’s hard to accept there is no @entity70 footballer beyond @entity188 is there			0
@entity200 , @entity201 and @entity182 were all excellent in @entity54 ’s @entity184 win , my player of the year is @entity182			0
’ @entity185 is still 1 - 5 on , but @entity188 could get the nod … he is 9 - 2 … @entity192 is 10 - 1			0
btw : @entity123 embarrassed himself by ranting during his press conference over speculation that @entity58 could spend a further £ 200m on new players			2
the @entity207 called it ‘ disgusting ’			0
the @entity58 boss complained that naming names - a long list well known to readers of this column – and the sums of money involved , hindered @entity58			2
he even complained that clubs like @entity58 and @entity51 were compromised by having to pay bigger fees for players compared to clubs like @entity114 and @entity220 and he blamed ‘ press speculation ’ for this			1
in that respect @entity224 is either ‘ deluded ’ , ‘ disrespectful ’ , or even ‘ disgusting ’			0
the truth is , @entity58 play on their big name and big resources to attract big names			2
part of that process is to leak names and numbers to lure the players			0
it ’s part of the process			0
a process which could actually be argued is ‘ disgusting ’			0
oh , and just to add , as a consequence of all that , @entity224 gets paid a lot more at @entity58 than he would at either @entity114 or @entity220			2
@entity58 manager @entity123 was not happy to talk about transfers at his press conference i say : i have a lot of sympathy with @entity246 for lashing back at a lynch mob of @entity249 fans			2
criticism and valid opinion is one thing , but vile vitriol is quite another			0
after all in , the wake of a revitalised @entity90 ’s 2 - 1 win over top of the table @entity83 what are the sinister elements of @entity260 out brigade on the @entity262 saying now ? @entity249 manager @entity246 had a row with one of his own fans during the defeat by @entity1			1

@entity1 and @entity0 both looking to sign strikers in january
@entity53 is @entity51 's top target for the summer
@entity77 could leave @entity51 for the @entity16 with @entity58 leading the chase
@entity1 could sign @entity96 defender @entity94 from @entity0
