by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 20:19 est , 21 may 2013 for @entity5 , the joy of passing her driving test at the first attempt was not to last long			1
after buying a £ 400 secondhand car , the 18 - year - old went online to sort out her insurance – and that 's where her problems began			1
for the first quote she got for her 800cc @entity13 , which should be in one of the lowest insurance categories , was an astonishing £ 33,000			1
shocked : only two car insurance companies offered @entity5 , 18 , a quote - the cheapest was almost £ 20,000 astronomical : miss @entity5 was looking to insure a @entity13 with an 800cc engine worth just £ 400 and the premium offered by a second firm was a similarly unaffordable £ 20,000			1
@entity5 , who is taking her a-levels this year , said : ' when i saw the numbers come up on my laptop screen i thought it must be a mistake			2
' but i 've tried it four times now and it 's the same every time			0
' after passing her test last week , the schoolgirl used price comparison websites , including @entity33 , to seek quotes – and only two companies offered to cover her			1
@entity36 quoted the teenager from @entity38 , @entity39 , £ 19,997 ( or £ 21,687 for monthly instalments ) and @entity41 , £ 33,845 ( or £ 37,900 for monthly instalments )			1
her brother @entity43 , 28 , a forklift truck driver , asked his own insurance company for a quote but was told it could not cover her			2
disappointed : miss @entity5 had been hoping having a car would help her find a job , but now she will have to do without he said : ' i thought she must have put the details in wrong , like she 'd accidentally put that she 's got a gold - plated @entity52 or something			1
' but we 've checked so many times			0
there is no justification for charging that kind of money			0
the @entity61 would be cheaper to insure			0
' he added : ' it might be because of the area , her age or the car			0
the area used to be rough but now it 's not as bad			0
' a @entity41 spokesman said the company always tried to provide a quote and often it was reduced once it could further evaluate the risks			0
an @entity74 spokesman said it was ' acutely aware that premiums like this are off the scale ' , but said young drivers were five times more likely to be in a serious crash where there was a personal injury award of £ 500,000 plus			0
the average annual insurance bill for women aged 17 to 20 is £ 2,256 – up 20.7 per cent on a year ago .			2

@entity5 , from @entity39 , passed her test last week at the first attempt
found only two insurance companies willing to give her a quote
one was almost £ 20,000 and the other more than £ 33,000
miss @entity5 was hoping having a car would help her find a job
