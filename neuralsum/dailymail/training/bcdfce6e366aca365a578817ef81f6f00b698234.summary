by @entity0 for @entity1 fears smokers opting for reduced - nicotine cigarettes would merely smoke more to get their hit are unfounded , say scientists			1
past studies have raised concerns that cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine could lead to people increasing the intensity of their habit to satisfy their cravings			2
but a new study by a team at the @entity17 in @entity18 has suggested the fears may not have been realised			1
nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in cigarettes , giving smokers the highs they crave and the withdrawals that can blight an attempt to quit			0
seventy - two adult smokers completed an unblinded trial of reduced nicotine cigarettes			1
after filling out smoking history surveys , the participants spent seven days smoking their usual choice of cigarette			0
that was followed by three consecutive weeks smoking different types of @entity48 , reduced nicotine level cigarettes			2
each week the levels of nicotine reduced , from 0.6mg in week two to week four when the participants smoked @entity48 3 - with a nicotine emission of 0.05mg			2
a regular cigarette has a nicotine emission level of around 1.2mg			0
the scientists found that the smokers taking part did not change the number of cigarettes they smoked or the number of inhalations they took during each of the four weeks			0
the study authors , said : ' the findings provide little evidence of compensatory smoking of quest cigarettes - those with lower nicotine levels - , with no increases in exhaled breath carbon monoxide levels and smoking intensity			1
a study of 72 adult smokers found ' little evidence of compensatory ' smoking during a four - week experiment where smokers started with their usual brand , before smoking special low nicotine cigarettes for three weeks ' no significant differences were observed for smoking urges or measures of nicotine dependence			1
' the study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants			1
' @entity94 , one of the study 's authors , mentions that the @entity97 now has a mandate ' to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to negligible amounts ' , @entity93 reported			0
he said : ' our study suggests that smokers are unable or unwilling to compensate when there is markedly less nicotine in the cigarette and when the experience of smoking is far less rewarding			2
' our study may help regulators anticipate the possible consequences of mandatory nicotine reductions in cigarettes			0
' the study was published in @entity115 .			0

study has countered the *belief* reduced nicotine cigarettes increase intensity
team at the @entity17 in @entity18 studied the habits of 72 adult smokers over a four - week period
found ' little evidence of compensatory smoking of lower nicotine cigarettes '
