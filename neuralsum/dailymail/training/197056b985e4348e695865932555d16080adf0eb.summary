by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 29 november 2012 @entity1 has gone on hunger strike the mother of the youngest @entity5 soldier killed in @entity6 has gone on hunger strike after the government axed her benefits as a result of his death			1
disabled @entity1 , 44 , lost £ 300 - a - week when her housing and council tax benefit , along with income support were stopped after her son @entity17 was blown up in a @entity19 ambush in july 2009			1
before his death , selfless @entity17 had instructed his mum to use any insurance money to be used to bring up his younger brothers @entity23 , nine , and @entity24 , seven			1
his family received a £ 68,000 death - in - service ( @entity28 ) pay - out , combined with a £ 150,000 @entity30 insurance payout			1
but because it was transferred into his deceased estate , with @entity1 named as the signatory on the account and executor for the estate , rather than into a trust fund for her young sons , the government ruled the money made her financially secure			1
because the @entity41 define compensation as savings , it means that @entity1 was technically over the £ 16,000 threshold which meant her benefits were slashed			1
as a result , she was forced to use @entity17 ’s money to live on instead of securing her sons ' futures which had been his wish			1
in a desperate bid to persuade the government to make @entity28 pay - outs exempt from means tested benefits , @entity1 , from @entity56 near @entity57 , @entity58 , went on hunger strike at midnight on sunday			1
@entity1 , who suffers from the incurable degenerative condition @entity61 , survives now on £ 140 a week in disability , child tax credits and child benefits			2
she has been threatened with eviction from her three - bedroom home over rent arrears and warned she faces bailiffs for non-payment of council tax			2
brave @entity71 asked his mother to use his death - in - service payout put in a trust fund for his two younger brothers single mother @entity1 says she is protesting about the current rules about payouts after her benefits were cut @entity1 even tried to kill herself by taking an overdose in june this year after being driven to despair after struggling to keep @entity17 ’s promise to keep the money for his brothers			1
speaking before she went on hunger strike , she said : ' @entity17 ’s intention was to provide for his younger brothers in the event of his death			1
' i ’ve written to @entity89 but his response was that it would be inappropriate for him to get involved in my case			0
' i feel he has let me down			0
i have exhausted every channel open to me			0
' today the single mother vowed she would continue to refuse solid food until the government ' started a dialogue ' with her about the issue			2
@entity1 , said : ' right now i am feeling hungry and tired			2
' but i am doing it to give my sons the future their big brother wanted for them and for other military families in my position			2
' the boys do n’t know what ’s going on as they are staying with their grandparents			0
' i hope it does n’t come to it but whether i die or not is in the government ’s hands			0
@entity17 , seen here aged 16 with his mother and his two younger brothers , @entity23 and @entity24 , had hoped that the money from his death would be used for their future @entity17 , pictured here taking his oath of allegiance in with the mayor of @entity122 and his mother , spent his last few moments trying to help others ' i ’m not doing this to get my benefits back as even if the legislation did change i would n’t get them back			1
' i ’m not doing this on a whim			0
i ’ve been thinking of going on hunger strike for a while but hoped it would n’t have to come to it			0
' i totally agree that people who have more than £ 16,000 in savings should not get benefits			0
' but by taking into account the @entity28 ( death - in - service ) payment , this means the sacrifice of armed forces personnel is not recognised			1
' i will survive on fluids			0
my children will be cared for by close family because i do n’t want them to be exposed to what i am doing			0
' i will be at home alone			0
everything i possess and everything belonging to my late son is here			0
' @entity17 died seven weeks after his 18th birthday while serving with @entity153 , @entity154			2
the troop was hit by two roadside bombs in a ' daisy chain ' @entity19 attack in @entity160 - killing @entity17 and four other @entity161			1
brave @entity17 spent his last moments helping the injured and comforting badly - wounded commanding officer @entity163			1
@entity1 , pictured meeting @entity89 in 2010 , says she has had to use her son 's payout money to live after the government slashed her benefits @entity17 's troop was hit by two roadside bombs in a ' daisy chain ' @entity19 attack in @entity160 province @entity175 mp @entity174 , who has supported @entity1 ’s cause since her son ’s death , said : ' it is really difficult because losing a son is just a terrible tragedy but i do n’t know if this is the right thing to do as she has two little boys			1
' i met @entity89 on monday night and we spoke about this			0
' he is sure that the @entity187 will follow the correct procedure and i have raised the issue with the @entity41			0
' a @entity41 spokeswoman added : ' money can never compensate for the loss of a loved one , but families of our servicemen and women who are tragically killed on active duty do receive financial support			2
' the welfare state is there to help people with very little means to support themselves , and that means that people with savings above £ 16,000 are usually not eligible for all benefits			0
' however , they may still qualify for non-means tested support like @entity211			0

@entity1 wanted to fulfil son @entity17 's wish that his death - in - service payout would be used as a trust fund for his younger brothers
son @entity17 , 18 , was killed by a roadside bomb in a @entity19 ambush in 2009
because the payout was paid into a deceased estate , not a trust fund , the government ruled she was financially secure
now she has had to use money on everyday living *expenses* , instead of saving it to secure her two son 's futures
