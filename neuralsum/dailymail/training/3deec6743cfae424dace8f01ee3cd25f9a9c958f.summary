cash - strapped counties in six states are enrolling inmates in @entity4 health insurance plans as a way to shift costs to the federal government – a tactic that 's legal but frustrating for some @entity9 who do n't want to see the success levels of president @entity12 's signature law inflated artificially			1
in many cases jails are registering inmates so they 'll be better equipped to access addiction counseling and psychiatric care after their release , lowering the likelihood that they 'll return for more time behind bars			0
the @entity4 prohibits the enrollment of full - time prisoners serving sentences , but many prisoners awaiting trial in prison jumpsuits are being enrolled purely to save county governments money – and shift costs to the feds – when they lengthy hospital stays are required			1
@entity4 is fast becoming a tool to save counties money that they would otherwise spend on health care for inmates who have not yet been convicted of crimes the law specifically excludes people who are ' incarcerated , other than incarceration pending the disposition of charges ' – legal language referring to the two - thirds of county jail inmates who have been denied bail or ca n't afford to post a bond to gain release before trial			1
' this provision , ' says @entity49 , a criminal justice consultancy , ' will likely allow eligible inmates who are pending disposition of charges to enroll in a health insurance plan through their state insurance exchange prior to conviction			0
' not everyone thinks this is a good thing , particularly congressional @entity9 who want to see the @entity4 law 's net cost to he federal government go down , not up			2
' we just found out that @entity4 is going to cost $ 2 trillion over 10 years , ' an aide to a @entity9 senator , who requested anonymity , told @entity66 on thursday			0
' now we 're going to have local governments picking our pockets to pay for their jail inmates ? what a disgrace			2
' ' it makes you wonder , ' the @entity74 staffer said , ' when the president gets excited about enrolling a few million people : how many of them are criminals ? ' @entity4 excludes convicts , but opens a loophole for officials who want to avoid using their own budgets to help sick prisoners the $ 2 trillion figure came from the nonpartisan @entity85 , which issued a report tuesday covering the economic impacts of the law			1
@entity89 reports that nearly 7 million people were incarcerated , paroled or serving probation terms in the @entity92 at the end of 2012			0
and every year about 13 million people – one in every 25 @entity92 – are booked into county jails each year			0
on january 28 , @entity97 sheriff @entity96 asked the city 's board of supervisors for permission to sign up inmates for @entity4 as soon as they 're fingerprinted and processed			1
his office estimates that the local government will save $ 2,500 in the long run for each inmate it enrolls			0
that 's because emergency room visits and treatment for chronic conditions can pile up when patients are uninsured			0
but since most jailed inmates come from socioeconomic conditions that make them more likely to be sick , their entry into the @entity4 system puts them on equal footing with elderly patients who will take more money out of the system than they put in			1
taxpayers in all 50 states will cover the costs for county governments as @entity4 's expenses spiral upward even young inmates are as likely to be as sick in the years after their release as older people who have never been in the criminal justice system , according to data from the @entity130			1
and the large majority who enroll in @entity133 instead of in private health plans will not contribute any money at all toward health care that taxpayers in all 50 states will have to subsidize			1
and that cost - shifting will include some direct medical care for inmates while they 're in custody			0
in @entity142 , @entity141 received a briefing in mid-january learning how much money they could save by putting inmates in @entity146 and the surrounding communities on @entity4			1
they have already applied for @entity133 for 700 inmates , targeting the sickest and most likely to consume county resources when they seek medical care			2
the estimated $ 1 million savings from an annual health care bill of $ 15.7 million does n't even include a potentially larger windfall from billing @entity133 for inmates ' hospital treatments			2
@entity4 's enrollment statistics will also increase artificially as inmates are enrolled as soon as they are booked and fingerprinted the @entity4 specifically allows county officials to submit hospital invoices to the federal government when the treatment takes more than 24 hours , but only if the patient is a @entity133 enrollee			1
county officials estimate that between 70 and 80 per cent of their inmates are eligible			2
@entity167 , @entity166 has similar numbers			0
its officials have already enrolled about 2,000 prisoners			0
one former @entity173 @entity92 senator who debated the @entity4 told @entity89 that he and his colleagues never intended for @entity4 to cover incarcerated people who are the responsibility of local governments			2
' it starts to look a little like a scheme by the states and local jurisdictions to avoid responsibilities that are really theirs , ' he said .			0
