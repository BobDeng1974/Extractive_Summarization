during a spacewalk on 7 october a ‘ @entity5 ’ was spotted hovering near the @entity1 , leading some to suggest @entity2 had inadvertently revealed an alien spaceship in orbit			1
sadly the answer is much more straightforward , with the smudge being either an speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun. that has n’t stopped some conspiracy theories arising though , with ufologists somewhat speculatively claiming it was proof that we are not alone in the universe			1
a ‘ @entity5 ’ appeared briefly ( shown in red ring ) in a @entity2 video of a spacewalk on the @entity1 on 7 october			1
the sighting led to speculation that it might be an alien spacecraft			1
but experts have revealed it is just an artefact in the image such as lens flare			1
' my guess is that it 's an artefact of some sort , ' says professor @entity31 the not - so - alien object was spotted when flight engineers @entity33 of @entity2 and @entity35 of @entity36 conducted a spacewalk outside the @entity1 to fix an electrical problem			1
in video shot by @entity2 and uploaded to @entity40 last week , the @entity5 can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts , before the camera cuts to another angle			1
outlandish theories suggested it might be an alien spaceship joining the @entity1 in orbit			2
of course these theories are very wide of the mark , clearly evidenced by the fact the object does n't appear in other images - aside from more obvious reasons			0
another theory suggested it might be a @entity56 or @entity57 spacecraft , but as both of these were docked at the station at the time of the spacewalk this was not possible			0
as the object is not moving in the image another suggestion was that it was a piece of debris that fell off the @entity68 , again , as the object does not appear in other images this also seems unlikely			0
this leaves just one option , namely that it is an artefact in the lens of the camera taking the shot , likely just a bit of glare from the sun as the @entity1 continued its orbit around @entity81			2
@entity2 was yet to comment on the event when contacted by @entity83			0
in images just before a point in the live feed the smudge is not visible , but then in the next moment it suddenly appears			0
some observers were quick to label the object a ‘ mysterious craft ’ or some other sort of @entity5			2
‘ the video showed astronauts spacewalking as they were working on a mission , ’ says @entity93			2
‘ suddenly almost after 1:50 minutes , a mysterious craft appeared flying near the astronauts for a few seconds			0
‘ the shape and size of the @entity5 could not be defined clearly as the telecast was not much clear			0
’ but others were less than convinced			0
professor @entity31 from the @entity104 @entity103 tells @entity83 : ' generally speaking @entity5 sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence			1
the event took place on 7 october as two astronauts performed a spacewalk			1
@entity114 @entity33 and @entity115 @entity35 moved a refrigerator - sized pump ( shown in the foreground of this image ) that had been left outside the station since december 2013 construction of the @entity1 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425 kilometres )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000 kilograms ) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity81 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600 kilometres ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,800 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity81 , and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years			0
‘ it 's difficult to judge from the video in this instance , because of its poor quality			0
' if @entity2 has access to high quality images , they may investigate further			0
‘ it 's difficult correctly to interpret the size of an object on a 2d projection			0
‘ however , while the " object " was visible , the @entity1 must have moved a considerable distance [ but ] there appears to be no change in the size			1
‘ so if it was indeed an object , it was travelling with the @entity1 ‘ my guess is that it 's an artefact of some sort , not space debris , unless something suddenly detached from the @entity1 ’ but he adds it ’s ‘ unlikely to be an " object " - this sighting is n't enough to convince the sceptics			1
’ space science writer @entity165 adds : ' i ’d say it looks like a reflection inside the camera , a trick of light			1
' it ’s not moving at all so it ’s unlikely to be floating hardware , but it looks like it could be the reflection of some hardware hitting the lens the right way to show up on the image and look like a @entity5 when really , it ’s not physically there			2
' the @entity1 ( shown ) has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000 kilograms ) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			2
it completes an orbit of @entity81 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600 kilometres ) per hour @entity184 and @entity35 were working to relocate a failed cooling pump the size of a fridge and install a power cable device to provide backup electrical capability to the station			2
it was the station ’s 182nd spacewalk ( shown ) in support of station assembly and maintenance , and the first for both @entity33 and @entity35			1
meanwhile @entity196 , author of the @entity197 , says : ' in these latest images a faint elongated object appears and brightens			0
' it is visible for a few seconds and it is not reportedly seen by the two astronauts carrying out repairs to the @entity1 ' to sceptics it is caused by lens flare or light reflecting off a piece of debris ; to ufologists this is convincing evidence that ufos are taking a regular and active interest in the @entity1 ' if it was a @entity5 it would have been nice if its alien occupants had stepped out and helped with the repairs			1
' some have incorrectly speculated that it could be one of two spacecraft docked to the @entity56 or the @entity219 - but as both were docked at the time this is n’t possible			0
the fact that the @entity1 is quite clearly bathed in sunlight at the time - as the whole shot is in light - heavily suggests it is a bit of lens flare from the sun on the camera lens			1
the examiner was slightly more speculative in its analysis of the incident though : ‘ the october 7 incident can not be video of either the @entity235 or @entity57 spacecraft which are docked			2
nor does it appear to be caused by a lensflare / camera reflection			0
' the elliptical shape of the object is consistent with earlier incidents at the @entity1 involving ufos close by or even docking with the @entity1 ' is it possible that once again , a spacecraft of unknown origin has been captured on video visiting the @entity1 , this time monitoring a spacewalk by two astronauts ? ’ seen here are the astronauts outside the @entity1 before the ' @entity5 ' appeared			1
the fact that the @entity1 is quite clearly bathed in sunlight at the time - as the whole shot is in light - heavily suggests it is a bit of lens flare from the sun on the camera lens some might be disappointed that the real explanation , though , is slightly more mundane - if the event in which live footage is broadcast from a football pitch - sized space station hurtling around @entity81 at 17,150mph ( 27,600 km / h ) can be considered mundane			1

a more recent spacewalk taking place today is shown in this frame grab image from a live @entity2 feed showing @entity279 cosmonauts @entity277 and @entity280 outside the iss. the astronauts are performing maintenance , among other tasks - but no ' ufos ' have emerged in the latest footage			1
