by @entity0 passengers on the budget airline @entity2 are trying to save more money by eluding extra baggage fees			1
this excess carry - on is causing many passengers to lose their allocated cabin space , as well as prolonging the boarding process			2
in order to address the mounting concern , @entity2 will implement ‘ cabin baggage officers ’ in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17 on a trial basis			1
nip in the bud : @entity2 will soon introduce ' cabin baggage officers ' at airport gates in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and the @entity17 any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage on board will be placed in ' hold in line ' , where baggage officers will weigh their luggage the officers will be located at airport gates , where they will weigh and measure customer ’s bags as well as arranging to have luggage checked if it looks oversized or over the assigned weight			1
at present , passengers who have checked in online can avoid having their bags checked by @entity2 staff until reaching the gate lounge , which is allowing those with excess carry - on to board the flight without the extra-baggage charges , reports @entity40			2
now , passengers who attempt this will have their bags placed in the aircraft hold in line , along with the checked baggage allowance that they have purchased			2
