by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 15:17 est , 28 march 2013 somewhere in a galaxy far , far away ... scientists believe they have captured the first image of a planet orbiting two suns			2
a team of @entity8 astronomers believe the snappily - named @entity9 ( @entity10 ) b - could be a ' @entity12 ' world just like the fictional home of @entity14 in the @entity16 films			1
the image , captured by telescopes at the @entity19 in @entity20 , shows a large object orbiting binary stars			1
discovery : the binary stars appear to have a large object orbiting them ( the circle and green arrow demonstrate the planets movement between 2002 and 2012 ) however , it is so massive that researchers are not sure yet if it is a failed star or an enormous planet			1
they say deciding its identity could teach us more about how stars and planets form			0
the arid , lawless landscape of @entity12 was the setting for some of the most famous scenes in the @entity16 films			2
planets orbiting binary stars have been seen before , but only through indirect methods			1
@entity48 of the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity8 , and colleagues took the picture in november last year			0
after searching the telescopes archives they discovered the large object had moved considerably between 2002 and 2012			0
they believe it is orbiting the dual suns at a distance of about 12.5billion kilometres			2
this would be close enough for it to have been born from a disc of the dust surrounding them , as a planet would			0
iconic : in the @entity16 films , @entity14 lives on a fictional planet with two suns called @entity12 but it is 12 to 14 times the mass of @entity70 , placing it near the dividing line between planets and failed stars called brown dwarfs			1
' it 's either one of the most massive planets you can form or the lowest - mass star you can imagine , ' @entity48 told @entity79			0
@entity48 added that the current mass - based dividing line between planets and failed stars ' is more of a working definition , as it is easier to measure the mass of an object than its past formation history '			2
his team is now analysing the object 's light spectrum to learn more about its atmosphere			0
' it 's a really cool image , ' @entity93 of the @entity94 told new scientist			0
asked whether he thinks @entity97 ( @entity10 ) b is really a @entity12 planet , @entity93 said : ' i 'm giving it a firm maybe			1

@entity8 astronomy team find object orbiting binary stars
@entity107 ( @entity10 ) b could be a so - called @entity12 world
distance from suns *suggest* it is a planet formed from solar dust
