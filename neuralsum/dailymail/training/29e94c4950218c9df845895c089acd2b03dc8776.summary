i believe it is time to start educating @entity2 after his latest smoking incident			1
he needs somebody explaining to him how to behave			0
if he was smoking that pipe , even if it does n’t do him any serious damage as a player ... well , i would n’t put myself in that position			2
being in the team should mean so much to you , and is such a reward for all your efforts , that it ’s not worth that risk			0
@entity2 is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation — but you never are as a footballer			2
there is always somebody on the look - out			0
you have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that ’s how you should want to live anyway			1
@entity2 is still out injured , of course , and will be sad to miss a north @entity13 derby that has got all the makings of a cracking match			1
after beating @entity49 5 - 3 on @entity50 , @entity48 will be thinking they go into the game as @entity20 ’s equals			1
a puffed out @entity2 takes a breather during training as he looks to regain fitness following injury @entity57 insists it is time for fans to get behind their forward ahead of the game against @entity20 @entity57 ’s side will be confident , the crowd will be expectant and there will be greater belief among the players			1
but @entity20 put in their best away performance in five years against @entity68 at the @entity69 — they were happy to concede possession and were clinical in attack			2
i think they will go into the game with a better balance and if there ’s any naivety in @entity48 ’s play , @entity20 will punish them			1
it ’s the @entity81 derby as well this weekend and another of my old sides , @entity79 , got a vital win last week			0
there might be some momentum from that while @entity87 had a tricky game against @entity89 and will have less time to prepare			0
for people to question @entity93 ’s position is ridiculous			0
he just needs to be more consistent			0
and there ’s no better place to make a mark than in a derby game .			2

@entity20 *midfielder* @entity2 needs to be educated on his *behaviour*
@entity19 has lost his place in team because of smoking issue
@entity2 should know that footballers need to be squeaky clean
@entity48 will go into north @entity13 derby thinking they are equals
