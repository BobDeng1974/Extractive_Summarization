by @entity0 a radical 30ft high bamboo ' flower basket ' could help give water to underdeveloped areas , it has been claimed			1
the structure harnesses condensation from the air using a specially - developed material			2
called @entity13 , its @entity11 inventor hopes it could bring drinking water to villages in @entity16			0
helping to end thirst : @entity13 is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in @entity19 , where women and children walk several hours to collect water			1
the 9 metre tall bamboo framework ( mock - ups pictured ) has a special fabric hanging inside capable to collect drinkable water the name ‘ @entity13 ’ comes from the @entity27 , a giant wild fig tree native to @entity19 , traditionally used for public gatherings and school education			1
these trees are a very important part of the ecosystem and culture of @entity19 and its disappearance seems unfortunately unavoidable			2
in many areas , they are known as the ' source of life ' ' @entity13 is designed to provide clean water as well as ensure long - term environmental , financial and social sustainability , ' designer @entity41 told @entity45			1
' once locals have the necessary know how , they will be able to teach other villages and communities to build the @entity13 towers			0
' each nine - metre tower costs approximately $ 550 ( £ 330 ) and can be built in under a week with a four - person team and locally available materials			0
they are designed for areas where digging wells is not possible			1
' @entity13 ' is a project conceived for the mountainous regions in @entity19 , where women and children walk several hours to collect water , the designers said			1
the bamboo framework has a specially - engineered fabric hanging inside it , capable of collect fresh water extracting condensation from the air			1
the lightweight structure can be constructed , lifted and fixed to the ground without special machinery the tower can also be equipped with a solar - powered led to provide illumination at night , giving the chance to children to study after sunset and also supporting the social space in the village in the evening the lightweight structure can be built with local skills and materials by the village inhabitants			0
@entity41 hopes to have two @entity82 erected in @entity19 by 2015 and is looking for financial rainmakers who 'd like to seed these tree - inspired structures across the country			1
the tower is built in sections installed from top down , so no scaffolding is needed			2
the bamboo structure ( pictured ) uses condensation to remove moisture from the air using a specially developing material			2
it is hoped that the concept will help bring water to people living in @entity16 the 9m tall bamboo framework has a special fabric hanging inside it capable to collect drinkable water			0
designers hope to have two @entity82 erected in @entity19 by 2015 the lightweight structure can be constructed , lifted and fixed to the ground without special machinery			2
the stable triangular framework of the tower is achieved by connecting the bamboo either with natural fibre , plastic or metal wires			0

the stable triangular framework of the tower is achieved by connecting the bamboo either with natural fibre , plastic or metal wires each tower ( aerial view pictured ) costs approximately $ 550 and can be built in under a week with a four - person team and locally available materials the fog - harvesting fabric can be lovered for maintenance , but also to indicate the availability of water from far			1

in further developments muscle powered energy can be produced by people while gathering under the tree , the team say			0

structures use condensation to take water from the air in *morning* fog
can be built by villagers and *transported* to most needed areas by *donkey*
designed to be used in @entity19 where wells can not be dug
