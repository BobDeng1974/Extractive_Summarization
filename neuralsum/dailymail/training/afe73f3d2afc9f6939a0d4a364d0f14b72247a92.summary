by @entity0 published : 00:19 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 12 march 2013 a council has been forced to apologise after its contractor mistakenly chopped down a tree planted by school children 30 years ago			1
the sycamore tree was planted in the centre of the market square in @entity8 , @entity9 , and was often used for shade by shoppers who would sit on benches beneath its green leaves during hot weather			1
but the 40 - ft tree was accidentally felled by a council contractor who , it has since emerged , should have been simply pruning a different nearby tree			1
before : a 40ft sycamore tree planted by school children 30 years ago dominated the market place square in @entity8 , @entity9 @entity23 has apologised for the blunder and told its contractor he will have to pay for a new tree to be planted			1
many shoppers and traders were shocked by the mistake which has left a large hole in the market place			0
@entity32 , of @entity34 bookshop , said : ' everyone in town is talking about it			0
' we had been notified that three trees in a row at the back of the market were being pruned , so when i heard the chainsaw i went outside to have a look but it was too late			0
' it was at least 30 years old and @entity48 , who had just arrived as the headteacher of the community primary school , can remember schoolchildren being pictured at the planting			0
' the town 's mayor , @entity54 , said : ' i know this tree was looked upon in an affectionate manner but , to be honest , there is nothing we can do about it now and it will be replaced in due course			0
after : but a council contractor mistakenly chopped down the popular tree instead of simply pruning another one situated nearby ' it is a very unfortunate accident but the contractor made a genuine mistake			1
' @entity67 of the @entity68 , which is away from where the sycamore once stood , said the tree can not simply be replaced			2
she said : ' the tree was a really nice feature of the market place			2
' i know that a lot of the stallholders will miss it and of course you ca n't replicate it with a new one			0
' it towered above our two - storey building - people have been coming down here just to have a look at where the tree once stood and where there is now just a space			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity23 said : ' despite providing the tree contractor with location plans he regrettably , mistakenly felled the wrong tree in @entity97			1
how it looks now : @entity23 has apologised for the mistake and said the contractor will cover the costs of a new tree being planted ' the contractor had undertaken pruning works to this tree in the past and as this was the only tree visible to him in the area he wrongly thought that this was the tree that was to be felled			1
' it was not a case of species misidentification			0
this is a genuine error on behalf of the contractor who is apologetic for his actions			0
' the contractor will be required to remove the stump of the felled tree and supply , and plant a suitable replacement specimen at his own expense			2
' it should be noted that the tree in question was identified for future removal as this species will become too large for its location and close proximity to buildings			0
' the tree that should have been removed will be felled shortly to provide space for the surrounding trees to grow and that will complete the current works for @entity8			1
