by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 05:16 est , 27 july 2012 it was just another holiday snap			0
sat side - by - side and perched on a fence , five young men with unkempt hair and wearing serious expressions stare into the camera			0
the year was 1982 and the photo was taken on a self - timed camera during a vacation at @entity11 in northern @entity12			1
the men in the picture - @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 - were high school friends from @entity20 , @entity12 , who at just 19 had their whole lives ahead of them			1
1982 : fresh out of high school , friends ( from left to right ) @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 take an impromptu photo while on holiday at @entity11 in northern @entity12 1987 : five years later and the men decide to recreate their 1982 photo by adopting a similar pose 1992 : now approaching 30 , the men again strike a similar pose as they establish a five - yearly tradition little did they know that they would be taking that exact same photo once every five years for the next three decades			1
but that 's what happened , and the six follow - up photos are testament to the strong bond of friendship as the five men 's appearances slowly change over the years			2
the original july 1982 image featured three of the men - all called @entity18 - topless in the summer sun. but what sets it apart from other holiday pictures is the empty coffee jar held by mr @entity18			1
it contained a cockroach that the friends had decided to keep as a pet			0
mr @entity14 told @entity53 : ' for some reason , we all chose to have dark and mysterious expressions on our faces			2
i 'm sure we all thought we were being really cool			0
' priorities were so different back then			0
all i was really thinking about was summer and girls			0
' 1997 : the friends take their photo from a slightly different angle 2002 : wearing solemn expressions , they seem keen to recreate the atmosphere of the original photo 2007 : the men celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original photo by keeping their tradition alive 2012 : fast approaching 50 , the friends this year celebrated mr @entity19 's ( right ) upcoming nuptials over the next few years , the men - all now at university - continued to make annual pilgrimages to @entity11			1
but it was n't until 1987 that mr @entity14 , a photography enthusiast , decided the friends should try and recreate the 1982 photo			1
so the men sat in the same order , adopted the same poses and expressions as they had done five years earlier , and took a replica image again using a self - timed camera			0
the only noticeable differences are the men 's late - 80s hairstyles and a slightly different jar that contained no cockroach			0
mr @entity14 said : ' i think i had a feeling this might become some cool tradition , but i had no idea we would still be doing it for 30 years			1
' group photo : taking the picture has become more sophisticated in recent years , with the men desperate for it to turn out as accurate as possible to the 1982 original blow - ups : the men pose with large versions of their 1982 and 1987 group photos in the more recent images , the men have become increasingly particular about replicating the details of the original photo			1
so some have opted to wear the same clothes , while an ' official ' jar and hat have been selected to use every five years			0
although the men , now approaching 50 , live separate lives , they always gather for their five - yearly vacation to @entity11			2
over the years , they have been guest at each others ' weddings and some have moved out of @entity12			2
mr @entity19 work as a restaurant columnist and got married this month - in june , the five friends turned their get - together into a stag celebration			2
mr @entity14 works in photography and film ; mr @entity17 is a teacher ; mr @entity18 works for @entity126 , is married and moved to @entity127 , @entity128 ; and mr @entity16 is retired and lives in @entity129			1
none of the men has children .			0

in 1982 , @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 were high school friends from @entity20 , @entity12
little did they know that they would be taking that exact same photo at @entity11 once every five years for the next three decades
