the @entity1 is holding on to a stockpile of enriched uranium for use in nuclear warheads to destroy asteroids in ' planetary defense , ' the @entity0 reports			1
auditors were examining how the @entity9 was progressing in removing excess capacity , when the agency gave them a unique reason for extra material			2
a stockpile of components called canned subassemblies , the steel capsule within a nuclear bomb that contains the highly enriched uranium ,			0
were slated to be decommissioned in 2015			2
' @entity29 associated with a certain warhead indicated as excess in the 2012 @entity32 are being retained in an indeterminate state , ' read a report by investigators , ' pending a senior - level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids			1
' @entity40 writes that the ' pending ' evaluation means there is contingency planning for an asteroid striking @entity45 happening in the highest levels of government			2
@entity48 , a geophysicist at @entity49 who studies impact cratering , theorized that the plan may be ' an excuse for keeping the nuclear arsenal together			0
' melos and other researchers believe more effective tools can be developed that redirect asteroids			0
in 2005 , @entity61 's @entity60 spacecraft launched an impactor that successfully collided with the @entity64 comet and knocked it slightly off course			0
explosion : witness accounts reported a long , loud blast and extreme heat from the meteor exploding in the atmosphere @entity72 : the rock finally crashed through the frozen surface of @entity75 , near the city center , averting more destruction as for earthbound asteroids , nuclear scientists may be looking to use nuclear weapons to destroy small - sized asteroids like the one that exploded over @entity23 , @entity24 , in 2013 , before they enter @entity45 's atmosphere			1
the 65 - foot - diameter asteroid became a meteor once it entered @entity45 's atmosphere and crashed through the frozen surface of @entity75			1
more than 1,000 people were injured by the blast , mostly due to glass shattering in the explosion .			0

researchers at the @entity9 said that uranium slated to be decommissioned in 2015 would be held indefinitely while plans for planetary defense are considered
the government may be planning on using nuclear arms to destroy small asteroids , like the one that exploded over @entity24 in 2013 , before they reach @entity45 's atmosphere
