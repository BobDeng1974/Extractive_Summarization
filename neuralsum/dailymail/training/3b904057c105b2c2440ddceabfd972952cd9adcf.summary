a prosecutor who was sacked after attempting to indict @entity2 's political cronies for corruption told @entity4 today about his ordeal at the hands of the @entity9 governor 's ' mafia			1
' @entity10 , a prosecutor for 18 years in @entity9 ’s @entity11 , has spoken out following the revelations over the @entity14 scandal to reveal his firsthand account of being fired and shamed at the hands of @entity2 and his political henchmen			1
he said there were parallels between a criminal case he tried to prosecute – before , he says , it was unlawfully dismissed – and the @entity14 scandal , where @entity2 ’s staff closed off travel lanes leading to the @entity26 , in order to retaliate against a @entity29 mayor who had declined to endorse him for re-election			1
' it 's the governor 's office again using a state agency in an improper way for political purposes '			2
@entity10 is suing the state of @entity9 for records that he says will prove the case 's dismissal was the product of political corruption			1
he secured indictments against @entity47 , a county sheriff loyal to @entity48			0
she was accused of gross violations that included hiring staff without vetting them , supplying a @entity2 donor with a false law enforcement id and forcing underlings to sign loyalty oaths			2
according to @entity10 , the criminal case against @entity47 was moving along smoothly until the grand jury voted to indict her in march 2010			1
when the charges became public , an indicted undersheriff , @entity58 , allegedly told an aide that @entity2 will ' have this whole thing thrown out ' , according to the @entity62			2
another sheriff 's officer @entity63 , was also accused			0
the day a judge unsealed the indictments , @entity64 , @entity2 's deputy attorney general , arrived suddenly to take over the prosecutor 's office personally			1
@entity10 was shown the door			2
he was stripped of his job and ushered out of the courthouse by armed guards			0
@entity73 ? @entity10 is in no doubt @entity2 was pulling the puppet strings , saying he he governs like a gangster protected : hunterdon sheriff @entity47 , a @entity48 loyalist , saw corruption charges against her dropped suddenly it was surprise to all involved			1
a woman on the jury told the @entity81 in october that ' we had no real disagreements			0
it was cut and dried			0
' @entity10 is in no doubt @entity2 was pulling the puppet strings			1
according to @entity10 , he governed like a gangster			2
' it was mafia-esque , ' @entity10 told @entity4			1
' i was given no due process , i was fired without explanation and other people were intimidated in the office to remain silent			1
' i was called into the office and told to surrender my credentials , my phone and my badge to get into the building			0
i asked what was happening and they said i was n't entitled to an explanation			0
' he watched helplessly as the criminal case his office worked so hard lock down was tossed out just days after @entity2 's appointee got his hands on the reins			1
charges were dropped against all three accused			0
then the @entity2 machine flexed its muscles , he claims			1
‘ the day the indictments were unsealed the attorney general ’s office kicked out a prosecutor and took over our office , ’ @entity10 said , claiming all the evidence in the case was removed from his county and locked up in @entity115 , the capital city of @entity9			1
@entity10 claims attorney general @entity121 , who served with the governor when he was the state 's top federal prosecutor , acted on @entity2 's orders to install @entity64 in his place			1
' the attorney general works directly for the governor , ' he explained			0
' it 's not an elected position			0
the governor is the attorney general ’s boss			0
what this reflects is [ @entity2 's ] complete disregard to the law			2
brought low : @entity10 was a $ 100,000 prosecutor before he crossed @entity2 's administration			1
now he is suing to try and get his hands on the case files which have been locked away in @entity115 ' it shows his willingness to hurt people who are principled and who do take their oaths of office really seriously			1
if you 're in the way of his political ambitions you 're a target , or at least a potential target			0
' a spokesman for the attorney general today told @entity4 : ‘ the @entity10 case is a matter of pending litigation			1
we do not comment on matters of pending litigation			0
’ last year , @entity2 's camp laughed off the accusations in the @entity81 story			2
@entity158 , the governor 's top spokesman , said : ' this truly is some of the most wild - eyed conspiracy theories i ’ve heard in a long time			0
' @entity10 also claims that a ' cover - up ' followed the governor 's invasion of his turf			1
' governor @entity2 wanted nothing more than for me to remain silent and walk away with my tail between legs , ' he said			1
' that 's the power of retaliation			0
' @entity2 did what he did by firing me			2
but he also throws people under the bus to protect himself and insulate himself from accountability			0
' there 's inconvenience to people by closing the bridge down , ' he told @entity4 , ' but he 's also undermining the rule of law by dismissing valid criminal charges			0
' i am the law : @entity10 told @entity4 that @entity2 , pictured today at his @entity184 of his state address , ' throws people under the bus to protect himself and insulate himself from accountability ' and others are ' intimidated to remain silent ' @entity2 and his colleagues , he said , ‘ ignored and cut out those who had been working on the case			1
they took all the evidence and sent it back to @entity115			2
' @entity194 expects a judge to decide on january 28 whether to release transcripts from the grand jury testimony in the corruption case			2
he says if those records are made public , his lawsuit will likely succeed			0
' that 's the smoking gun , ' @entity10 said			2
' they ’re fighting like hell to prevent those transcripts from becoming public			0
' @entity9 's attorney general sent a cadre of five lawyers into court in august to oppose @entity10 's lawsuit			0
' i brought the lawsuits to ensure i was compensated on damages that affected me and my wife and three children , " he said , ‘ ' and also to have people know what happened			0
' now a schoolteacher living in @entity219 , he says he 's earning less than half the $ 100,000 salary he once enjoyed as a prosecutor			1
experts his lawyer retained say the damages he sustained are more than $ 1 million			0
@entity10 noted a final similarity between his story and the ' @entity14 ' saga enveloping governor @entity2 's office			1
' the thing that people who engage in misconduct hate most , ' he said , ‘ is exposure			0

@entity10 claims he was fired because he was prosecuting political cronies of @entity2 for corruption
was marched from office , *summarily* sacked , and the files were locked away in @entity115
draws parallels with @entity14 scandal , saying : ' it was mafia-esque
' i was given no due process , i was fired without explanation and other people were intimidated in the office to remain silent *...* . it was the same modus operandi '
@entity10 , now a teacher on half his former $ 100,000 salary , is suing to uncover the files on the case , which have been locked away in @entity115
