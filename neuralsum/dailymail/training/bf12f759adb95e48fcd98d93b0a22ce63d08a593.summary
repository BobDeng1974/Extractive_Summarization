' there is absolute commitment to keep the @entity118 going until repeal and support from young and old has never waned , indeed it may have increased			2
' the hunts took place a day after it was revealed that pro-hunting supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce @entity20 votes for @entity20 laws to push through a repeal of the 2004 @entity41 after the next election			1
a @entity177 pledge to hold a free vote in the @entity179 on scrapping the decade - old ban was quietly shelved after ministers realised it would be lost			2

a well - placed source in the pro-hunting campaign said : ' hunting is a classic example of the anomaly which allows @entity210 mps to dictate the law in @entity20 and @entity221 on an issue over which they themselves have no say in @entity210 because it is a matter that has been devolved to the @entity224			2
' any move to stop mps from @entity210 , @entity221 and @entity227 from voting on devolved issues in the next parliament would , therefore , make repeal or amendment of the @entity41 in @entity20 and @entity221 much more likely			0

hounds are known to have hunted the area nearby for at least 300 years a strong showing by the @entity247 – whose mps do not vote on @entity20 - only matters on principle – could have a similar effect			1
research by the pro-hunting @entity254 suggests that @entity20 and @entity221 mps would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now			0
the research , based on @entity255 ' public and private indications , suggests that 292 mps in @entity20 and @entity221 are in favour of repealing the law , with only 270 against			0
but the slim majority south of the border is heavily outweighed by overwhelming support for the ban among mps in @entity210 , where hunting was banned separately by the @entity224			1
the @entity254 believes that @entity210 mps would vote to keep the ban by 47 votes to six			0
@entity227 's mps are said to support repeal of the ban by eight votes to five			1

but , following cross-party agreement that @entity210 should be handed sweeping new powers , party leaders are now under intense pressure to bar @entity210 mps from voting on purely @entity20 matters at @entity315			0
@entity211 's 2004 @entity41 does not apply in @entity210 , where hunting was banned two years earlier			0
a @entity254 spokesman said : ' the promised vote on repeal has not materialised in this @entity224 , largely because of uncertainty about the outcome , with 41 @entity322 effectively vetoing any change in the law in @entity20 and @entity221			0
@entity210 has its own hunting legislation and there can be no justification for continuing to allow @entity322 to perpetuate the prejudice of the @entity41			0
' the @entity329 are expected to repeat their pledge to hold a free vote on hunting if they win the election			2
but anti-hunting groups are stepping up pressure on @entity211 to tighten the law , amid concern at the low level of prosecutions .			0

@entity0 , horses and hounds paraded through villages as 300 @entity7 hunts got underway across the country
they were met by huge crowds - with a quarter of a million well - wishers expected to turn out in support of hunting
