by @entity0 @entity1 , recognised as the best football co-commentator in tv sport , will make a dramatic return to the @entity6 game on saturday			2
@entity1 is back in the gantry alongside @entity8 at the unlikely location of @entity11 ’s @entity10 working for @entity12 on their live @entity14 coverage of the @entity17 side ’s fourth - round game against @entity18			1
former @entity18 striker @entity1 has not been heard on a football commentary produced by a @entity21 tv station since leaving @entity22 in 2011 after the controversy over his sexist comments off camera about assistant referee @entity27			1
comeback : @entity1 was widely renowned as the best commentator in the game before his @entity22 sacking the future : together with @entity33 he built up an aura , and he may now return - this time on @entity12 since then he has worked alongside his former @entity22 colleague @entity33 for talksport radio and for @entity37 based in @entity38			1
the fact @entity37 have agreed to @entity1 working for @entity12 , even on a one - off basis , opens up some intriguing possibilities over future shared football ambitions			2
it will cause huge concern for @entity22 if @entity37 and @entity12 join forces for the next @entity48 rights auction			2
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we are delighted @entity1 can stand in for @entity50 , who is overseas			2
’ shock : @entity1 pictured shortly after leaving @entity22 new ventures : @entity1 and @entity33 have sinced worked with @entity53 , amongst others @entity55 , former chief executive of the @entity56 whose flag - waving celebrity obsession during the @entity58 was mocked by parody @entity61 account @entity59 , has had his own postings on social media curtailed			2
@entity55 had kept the @entity66 association on his own @entity61 account despite leaving the @entity56 a year ago			0
but the @entity56 have now belatedly put a stop to that following complaints			0
@entity71 's @entity70 , shortlisted for the @entity72 that went to @entity73 , posted an @entity74 of himself with a ‘ @entity77 ’ trophy signed by all the @entity71 team			1
the wooden replica of the @entity72 had been sent in by a @entity71 fan in @entity80 for the players to sign and @entity70 saw the dressing - room photo opportunity			1
however , credit @entity71 for meeting supporters ’ requests for autographs			0
hoax : @entity89 ' ' @entity88 ' was actually a present from a @entity80 @entity71 fan one remarkable feature of @entity94 ’s assault on four trophies has been the unlikely harmony from boardroom to bootroom at a club that had previously been a byword for turmoil			1
insiders believe the departure of @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 — around whom a lot of the madness had revolved — has had a lot to do with the newfound calm			1
the club ’s unity was displayed on friday when manager @entity113 , captain @entity114 and football development executive @entity115 all attended the relaunch of @entity94 ’s women ’s team for the @entity118			0
team spirit : @entity113 and @entity115 ( centre ) were at the relaunch of @entity94 's women side @entity123 shootout shrink ? the woeful penalty shoot - out efforts by @entity126 players this week will add to the scrutiny of the @entity14 ’s new performance services chief @entity129 , whose views on the psychology of taking penalties will be crucial in the build - up to the @entity134			1
@entity126 have gone out of major tournaments on penalties six times in the last 24 years and the spot - kicks by @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 in @entity143 ’s @entity142 loss to @entity144 only underlined the problem			0
it will be @entity129 ’s call whether @entity126 need to take a sports psychologist to @entity148 , with manager @entity149 saying he is ‘ interested to hear what @entity129 has to say about it ’			0
and @entity126 do n’t have a great track record in that area			0
@entity154 did n’t do much during @entity156 brief tenure , and @entity158 ’s ludicrous faith - healer @entity159 was a joke figure among the players			0
will he , wo n't he ? @entity149 is considering hiring a shrink to help players in penalty shootouts blunders : @entity138 ( above ) and @entity139 ( below ) both missed penalties for @entity143 on wednesday , not boding well for @entity126 at the @entity134 ... sports management agency @entity167 are having to deal with media division chief @entity169 setting up her own business and taking racing clients @entity171 and @entity173 with her			1
@entity167 also have the problem of @entity175 withdrawing from cricket			0
@entity167 negotiated a five - year deal , under which @entity175 ’s name appears on @entity180 ’s bat , that goes through to 2017 .			0
