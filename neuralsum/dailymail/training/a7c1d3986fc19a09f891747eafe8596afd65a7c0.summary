‘ gone fishing ’ is a phrase usually associated with a quiet afternoon out on the water , fishing rod in hand , pondering the world			2
but these fishermen decided to forget rod and reel , opting for much more heavy - duty bait , a hand grenade			1
the stupid men are lucky to be alive after their attempt at catching fish in @entity14			1
scroll down to watch the video bombs away : with his friend 's signal , the fishermen holding the grenade drops it into the water hoping to catch some fish			1
he looks away in anticipation for the blast which is meant to happen underwater detonates too early : just a moment later the grenade explodes as it hits the water impact : the explosion knocks the men over and sends equipment and barrels flying into the water the hand grenade , which one of them dropped from their inflatable boat , exploded early just as it hit the water knocking the men over and equipment flying into the water			1
the explosion did not destroy the boat but the men remain still , stunned by the premature blast but seemed able to get up a few moments afterward			0
the video , filmed presumably from a nearby boat , captured the moments as their hand grenade fishing went horribly wrong			1
website @entity48 posted the video online on monday and it has already been watched more than 100,000 times and another 10,000 on @entity51			2
stunned : the fisherman who dropped the grenade gets up slowly after being thrown across the boat as the smoke clears : the fisherman goes to the aid of his friend , still dazed by the blast a @entity48 staffer said : ' it seems like a shot from a movie went horribly wrong			0
' someone commented : ' @entity66 ' russian style ! ' another said : ' i can see safety is of no concern			0
' a @entity51 user said : ' guess for dinner they 're having salmon ... smoked			0
' hand grenades are a common , but environmentally catastrophic , way of catching fish in some parts of the world			0
