teachers at @entity16 ’s school stopped her from bringing in the treats for an end - of - term charity cake sale because they breached ‘ health and safety ’ regulations			1
her mother @entity21 spent two hours making the 40 confetti and violet cream cupcakes – only to be told they were not fit for human consumption			2
@entity16 ’s tutor @entity26 at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , had called to check if she had the food certificate usually held by catering professionals			1
when she said she did n’t , the mother - of - five was told her cakes , which @entity16 had previously sold at the school without issue , could n’t be sold			1
the teacher explained @entity27 could be sued if a pupil fell ill having eaten a cake from an uncertified source			2
and he added other pupils planned to bring in shop - bought slices , cupcakes , and sponges for the end of term sale instead			1
however , eager to ensure the cakes did not go to waste , he suggested @entity16 still take the cakes in - for the teachers			2
mrs @entity4 , 39 , whose husband @entity50 is a landscape gardener , said : ' @entity16 came home from school and said they were having an end of term cake sale to raise money for charity			1
' i love baking and spend several hours a week making cakes and biscuits , so i offered to make some treats for her to take in			2
' i spent about two hours baking and icing the cakes but got a phone call from her teacher later that afternoon			0
' he was apologetic and sounded as if he felt a bit foolish as he asked if i had a food hygiene certificate			1
' he explained @entity16 was unable to sell the cakes unless they had been made by somebody who had the qualification because of " health and safety "			2
' i could n’t stop myself from laughing as he told me the school could be sued if a pupil fell ill after eating one of my cakes			1
' people have been baking cakes at home for sale at fetes and village fayres for years without any issues			2
' the teacher said other pupils planned to buy slices , cupcakes , and sponges from a supermarket and take them in to resell			0
' my daughters never eat that sort of food because it is often pumped full of artificial preservatives and e-numbers			0
' risk ' : mother - of - five @entity4 , 39 , was told she needed a food hygiene certificate to make cakes for her daughter to bring in to class because the school could be sued if a child fell ill after eating food from an uncertified source ' i would rather make them something fresh and natural - even though it ’s easier to nip to a shop and spend a pound on something in there			1
' mrs @entity4 , who lives in @entity28 , @entity29 , criticised the health and safety regulations			0
she added : ' the qualification the school was demanding is usually only held by catering professionals - not mums who enjoy baking as a hobby			0
' health and safety has gone mad when a mum must have a qualification to prove she is " safe " to make cakes for her daughter ’s friends			0
' however , the teacher did tell me all was not lost and that @entity16 could still take the cakes in for the teachers to enjoy			0
' the food hygiene certificate requires three hours of self - study time and costs about £ 15 to complete			1
it ensures people working in catering understand the impact of food borne illness and how to prevent contamination			0

he said : ' while it is indeed accurate that generally people preparing food for public consumption must be registered with the environmental health department , parents making the occasional cake to sell at a school event do not need to be registered			2
' i am sure though that the teacher clearly had the best of intentions for the health and safety of their students			0
' the council is very keen to support community events such as school fetes or village fayres and our environmental health service is more than happy to provide advice and guidance to organisers to ensure their day goes ahead with no problems			0
' headteacher @entity139 said : ' our health and safety advisor told us it is good practice to make sure somebody with a food hygiene certificate has made or supervised the preparation of the cakes			1
' the safety of our students is of paramount importance so we followed the recommended guidance			0
