@entity0 has risked further overshadowing @entity2 's preparations for next month 's @entity3 by claiming they 'd ' love ' him in their squad			1
the 34 - year - old was unceremoniously sacked by the national side last year after a spate of public run - ins with the management and players			2
@entity0 said in his autobiography – published in 2014 – that there had been a bullying culture inside the @entity2 dressing room , throwing particular ire towards @entity17			1
then - @entity2 team - mates @entity18 and @entity0 together at a practice session in @entity21 in 2012 @entity18 ( left ) replaced @entity22 ( right ) as @entity2 's one - day captain shortly before @entity24 @entity0 playing for the @entity25 against the @entity26 in the @entity27 but he has since attempted to flirt with the new regime in a bid to regain a place in the squad at both @entity32 and odi level			1
that continued apace on tuesday when , during a conversation with @entity36 while commentating on the @entity27 , he suggested @entity2 captain @entity18 wants him in the team for the @entity3 in @entity38 and @entity39			1
' i do n't know why i 'm not playing for @entity2 , ' he said			2
' i know the current @entity2 captain ( @entity18 ) would love me in the side			1
' i was sacked - @entity43			0
i get on pretty well with most of the guys in there , if not all of them			0
' i do n't see why ( i could n't play again )			0
' if the call came - only an injury could lead to that , because the final squads for all 14 competing countries have already been announced - @entity0 would still answer it			2
' i want to play for @entity2 , ' he said			0
' if i get the opportunity to play for @entity2 ... i 'm 34 years of age , @entity53 is 38 and has just scored a double hundred			0
' i honestly believe i 'm batting as well as i 've ever batted			0
' i 've got over my knee injury , which was huge - over the last 18 months , i 'd just hated batting because my knee has been so sore			0
' given half an opportunity to go and play the way i 'm playing at the moment , of course i would			0
' @entity0 is hoping to get back into both the @entity66 and @entity32 teams @entity18 in action during @entity2 's match against an @entity70 side at the @entity71 @entity72 ( left ) speaks to former @entity2 teammate @entity0 prior to his axe from the international set - up @entity0 's assertions come after @entity22 was relieved of his duties as one - day captain in december			1
the @entity79 - born batsman was typically outspoken in his criticism of @entity22 and now wants back in			2
and he may have an ally in @entity72 , who could n't understand the way in which @entity0 was sacked after the @entity84 humiliation last winter			1
' i just think the sacking became a media uproar , ' @entity72 told @entity90 's @entity89 programme			2
' it just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player gets dropped for poor form , do n't they ? ' but that is highly unlikely to happen , given the stress his words have put the @entity2 team under coupled with consistent poor form			0
@entity2 's first @entity3 game is against @entity38 on february 14 , with a warm - up triangular series against the hosts and @entity105 this month .			1
