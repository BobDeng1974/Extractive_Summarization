by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 press secretary @entity2 had a quote from president @entity5 about @entity6 being ' jayvee ' level terrorists thrown back in his face by a reporter today , hours after the @entity12 launched air strikes on the @entity15 militants in @entity16			1
speaking about @entity6 to @entity17 in january , @entity5 said : ' the analogy we use around here sometimes , and i think is accurate , is if a jayvee team puts on @entity24 uniforms that does n’t make them @entity25			1
' asked today by @entity29 reporter @entity28 if the president still thinks @entity6 is an amateur terrorist group , @entity2 dribbled around the question before claiming that the @entity3 does ' remain concerned about the military proficiency that 's been demonstrated ' by @entity15 militants in @entity16			1
two @entity12 @entity49 aircraft dropped 500 - pound laser - guided bombs on mobile artillery belonging to the jihadist group near @entity53 today this image , posted to twitter , depicts @entity6 extremists lining up followers of the @entity59 religion for execution ' there is no question that the @entity24 uniforms that were worn -			1
to draw out that analogy a little bit - that were worn by the @entity67 leadership in @entity68 has been decimated and defeated in @entity68 , ' @entity2 said			0
' there 's no question about that , ' he added			0
@entity2 said it ' also true ' that there are other terrorist networks that ' subscribe to the violent extremist ideology that 's espoused and promulgated by @entity67			0
' ' many of those groups , in nations across the globe , are not particularly sophisticated , are focused on local sectarian conflicts that do n't pose a significant or immediate threat to @entity12 interests or the @entity12 homeland			0
' ' there are of course a couple other organizations that do pose a more substantial threat to the @entity12 and our interests , ' he continued			0
among those , he admitted , are the @entity6 , @entity6 , also known as @entity6 , a militant group that was expelled from the @entity67 because of its ultra violent practices			2
' we do remain concerned about the military proficiency that 's been demonstrated by @entity6 , and it 's why you 've seen the president take steps , including the authorization of military force that would protect @entity12 citizens who might be harmed by @entity6 , ' @entity2 said			1
the statement was a near 180 degree turn about from the president 's earlier claim that @entity6 was n't a terrorist group worth taking seriously			2
since then @entity6 has barreled through @entity16 , destroying towns and murdering civilians			1
since the extremists began its rampage they have taken over 17 towns , including the city of @entity114			1
most recently the @entity15 took control of the dam there - @entity16 's largest - giving it control over a significant amount of water and electricity			2
as many as 200,000 religious minorities have fled from their homes in recent days to the mountains or refugee camps in the nearby town of @entity53 , the capitol of the independent region of @entity126 , after @entity6 threatened them with death if they did not convert to @entity15			2
more than 40,000 followers of the @entity59 religion escaped to @entity130 , where they remained hidden away for several days without food or water until the @entity12 air dropped supplies last night			0
the @entity12 also dropped two 500 - pound bombs on @entity6 artillery stockpiles just outside of @entity53 in an effort to stop the humanitarian crisis from turning into ' genocide			0
' ' for anyone who needs a wake up call , this is it , ' secretary of state @entity139 said this morning .			0

@entity5 *insinuated* in january that he did n't take @entity6 seriously
' the analogy we use around here sometimes , and i think is accurate , is if a jayvee team puts on @entity24 uniforms that does n’t make them @entity25 '
the @entity3 now says it does ' remain concerned about the military proficiency that 's been demonstrated ' by extremists in @entity16
@entity6 has taken 17 towns in @entity16 and has executed *countless* civilians who refuse to convert to @entity15
