@entity1 's planned £ 850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh @entity5 suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy			2
the new headquarters - seen by critics as a monument to the ego of outgoing @entity1 chief @entity12 - has run into ' serious financial difficulties ' according to the @entity15 news magazine @entity14 , which claims to have accessed paperwork relating to the complex			0
the magazine claims @entity20 's money problems , which it says @entity12 is aware of but is yet to inform @entity1 member states about , stems from a simple miscalculation over subcontractor costs and that without an additional £ 200 million funding , the entire project will grind to a halt			1
shambles : @entity1 's planned £ 850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh @entity5 suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and needs a £ 200million cash injection the new headquarters has run into ' serious financial difficulties ' according to @entity15 news magazine @entity14 @entity14 said : ' @entity12 is aware of the problem but has n't seen fit yet to inform the public about it , meaning the taxpayers of the 28 @entity1 member states			1
' ' at a meeting of @entity1 's @entity43 on december 19 , @entity12 's staff asked that the issue be dealt with ' confidentially , ' it added			0
the building has already more than doubled in cost and it is unlikely that @entity1 would want the pr disaster that would follow if the project was scrapped			2
the new building is seen by critics as a vanity project by outgoing @entity1 chief @entity12 @entity15 ambassador , @entity54 , told @entity55 in a confidential memorandum : ' we pointed to the disastrous effect on the image of the alliance if construction were to stop and if @entity1 appeared to be incapable of punctually completing a construction project that was decided at the @entity1 summit of government leaders in april 1999 in @entity65			2
' ' the risk of a further cost increase is already palpable , ' @entity54 added			0
the consortium 's spokesman told @entity14 : ' several unforeseen circumstances including significantly increased security requirements by @entity1 had led to the construction exceeding the initially agreed sum			0
' he refused comment on the looming bankruptcy			0
@entity78 taxpayers are currently set to pick up around 15 per cent of the bill for the new @entity1 headquarters with the increased costs almost certain to push that figure up even higher			1
any additional fee is bound to be controversial at a time when the @entity85 is making unpopular cuts to the country 's defence budget			1
speaking to the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 for @entity92 , said : ' i 'm afraid that , after a while , the primary goal of every international bureaucracy becomes its own expansion and comfort ' ' it 's true of the @entity101 and @entity102 and the @entity103 , and it would be surprising if it were n't also true of @entity1 ' he added			0

@entity78 taxpayers will pick up at least 15 per cent of the bill for the new building			1

*original* cost of @entity126 was £ *360million* but it has already more than doubled
now @entity20 says it needs another £ 200million to *continue* building
new financial problems *believed* to stem from miscalculation over costs
without additional cash injection construction is expected to grind to a halt
@entity78 taxpayers already picking up 15 per cent of the bill for new building
that figure may now soar at a time of unpopular @entity85 defence cuts
