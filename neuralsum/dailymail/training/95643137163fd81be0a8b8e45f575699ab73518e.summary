it is one of the country ’s newest , and most sentimental , @entity3 traditions : a festive offering guaranteed to reduce even the most hardened @entity6 into a sniffling , tear - sodden wreck			1
it is no surprise , then , when @entity11 starts to dab her eyes			1
because she is the mother of the boy starring in this year ’s @entity15 christmas tv commercial and she is sitting down to watch it for the first time			1
it prompts @entity11 to hug her eight - year - old son @entity19 , who was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the £ 1 million advert			1
for those who have n’t seen it yet , this year ’s @entity15 advert tells the heart - warming story of @entity38 and his penguin pal , @entity39			1
the inseparable pair are seen playing @entity41 and romping in the park , but it soon becomes clear that @entity39 is lonely for love			2
fast - forward to @entity45 and @entity38 surprises @entity39 with his gift of a mate , @entity47			1
the pair rub beaks , singer @entity50 ’s melancholy cover of the @entity52 song @entity53 soars – and the nation reaches for the hankies			2
‘ are you crying , mum ? ’ @entity19 asks , noticing his mother ’s tearstained face			2
‘ you are , you ’re crying ! oh , mum ! ’ he teases			2
‘ all right , all right , ’ replies @entity11 , regaining her composure			1
‘ i ’m just so proud of you			2
’ @entity19 was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the heart - warming festive ad			1
he is pictured with two of the toy penguins given to him by @entity15 devotees of @entity3 commercial breaks might be forgiven for thinking that @entity19 looks more than a little familiar			1
despite his tender age , he is , we can reveal , quite the ghost of television @entity3 past			2
last year , he played the adorable boy in the @entity3 advert			1
the year before , he was cast in the @entity75 ’s @entity3 spot – and made an appearance in the @entity3 special of @entity78			1
the @entity15 ad is arguably his biggest role , and one he ’s keen to repeat			1
‘ i ’m the king of @entity3 adverts ! ’ he declares			2
‘ i ’d really like to be in the @entity15 @entity3 advert every year from now on			1
i do miss everyone from @entity15			1
’ @entity11 , 34 , says : ‘ he is like the @entity3 child			1
i think it ’s all down to that cheeky face and grin			1
the directors of the @entity15 advert told me one of things they liked about @entity19 was the dimple he gets when he smiles			1
it ’s actually a scar from when he fell out of his bunk bed when he was aged five			2
‘ his dad and i are always telling him to look after his face , then he falls out of bed			2
’ @entity19 started acting at five after being taken on by child talent agency @entity98			2
‘ one of the ladies who worked at @entity19 ’s nursery had children at the same agency , ’ explains @entity11 , who owns a domestic cleaning franchise and lives in @entity101 , @entity102			1
‘ she kept saying @entity19 would be brilliant at acting because he ’s got a great face and a lovely personality			2
i thought it would be nice for him to build his confidence and if he enjoyed it , that would be all well and good			2
as a little one he was quite sociable and i wanted him to build on that			2
’ @entity19 sometimes does up to two castings a week in @entity116 , meaning he has to leave school early			0
when filming , he has to take time off , although the @entity15 ad was filmed long before @entity3 – in the summer holidays			1
‘ it ’s not like the kids are being taken out just to go on holiday			0
it ’s learning of a different kind			0
@entity19 is not sitting on a beach or at home doing nothing , ’ lucie says			0
@entity19 , playing seven - year - old @entity38 , opposite @entity39 the penguin in a scene from the new ad before he auditioned for his latest role , @entity19 , who has a younger brother and sister , had taken a break from acting to move house and schools			1
‘ i was a bit nervous , ’ @entity19 says			0
‘ @entity141 said i would get £ 2,500 so i was excited too			0
‘ but then she said , “ do n’t get your hopes up too much , there are millions of people going for it			0
” then a letter came through saying i ’d got it so i was happy			0
’ @entity15 has given @entity19 an enormous @entity151 toy and smaller @entity39 and @entity47 figures – which have already sold out on the retailer ’s website			1
@entity15 says more will be available next week			1
so will @entity19 spend some of his fee on a penguin onesie ( £ 20 ) or a pair of penguin cufflinks ( £ 20 ) , perhaps ? he says thoughtfully : ‘ @entity141 says i ca n’t really spend any money in my bank because i need to save up for a car			0
there is a remote - control dinosaur which costs £ 100 that i ’d like , though , ’ he adds , giving his mother a pleading look			1
‘ what my dad wants – and i want too – is a drone			0
they ’re £ 369 , which is n’t that expensive			0
’ ‘ that is quite expensive , @entity19 , ’ lucie reminds him			0
‘ he ’s become aware of how much money he has in his bank account from his acting work and asks to buy this , that and the other , ’ she explains			0
‘ but i ’ve told him a car could cost up to £ 10,000			0
the concept of how much things cost has n’t really sunk in			0
i ’m keen to keep his feet on the ground and teach him the value of money			0
’ the advert has already been watched by millions on television and 4.5 million viewers on @entity190			0
lucie says @entity19 was treated like a star during filming and had his own @entity195 mobile home for part of the shoot			1
at times , she admits , this treatment went to his head			1
@entity19 , left , in a scene from last year 's @entity202 special and right , in a festive advert for high street furniture store @entity205 last year ‘ he had the @entity195 to himself in the morning , ’ lucie recalls			1
‘ but by the afternoon there were a few other people using it			0
‘ i remember @entity19 saying in quite a loud voice , “ @entity212 , there are some people in my trailer , ” which was a bit embarrassing			0
’ he could also request whatever he wanted for lunch , provided it was healthy			0
‘ the catering van did n’t really have things for children so the poor runners were sent out all over @entity116 to get @entity19 a jacket potato or chicken nuggets , ’ lucie laughs			0
@entity226 was banned during the day but @entity19 was allowed ice cream at the end of filming			0
now ‘ the king of @entity3 adverts ’ has his eye on more substantial roles			0
his agent has put him forward for a part in the fifth @entity236 movie – and @entity237 could then beckon			0
‘ if he wanted to become a @entity237 actor that would be lovely , ’ lucie says			0
‘ the minute he says he does n’t enjoy it , then that ’ll be it			0
it ’s completely his decision			0

@entity23 is the star of the new @entity15 christmas tv commercial
eight - year - old was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the ad
@entity11 believes that he won the role in the ad *due* to his cheeky smile
and admits that the first time she saw the commercial , she cried too
