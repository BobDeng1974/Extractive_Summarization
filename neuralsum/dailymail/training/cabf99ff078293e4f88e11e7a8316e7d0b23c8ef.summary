gaudy palaces suspected of being built by @entity2 criminal masterminds on the back of criminal gang activities in the @entity5 and other @entity7 countries are facing demolition			1
authorities in @entity10 , a city in central - western @entity11 , are threatening to tear down the so - called ' gypsy palaces ' which have appeared across the region because all were built illegally , and many of them are safety hazards			1
police believe most were constructed on the back of illicit criminal enterprises abroad			1
checks carried out this month by employees of @entity39 revealed that more than 50 buildings in and around the city did not receive planning permission			0
the investigation also revealed that some of those who had the houses built around @entity47 and @entity48 were not even the rightful owners of the land on which they stand			1
' @entity52 recommended us to find a solution so that the owners of these properties comply to the law and pay taxes for them , ' said the mayor of @entity10 , @entity61			1
the cars all have @entity5 number plates which suggest the owners have links to the @entity5 just one of the many homes which were built without permission and are structurally unsafe but he warned that the legal process of demolition could take a while			1
the palatial neighbourhood of @entity10 's gypsy palaces began to expand a decade ago and now includes a few dozen villas on both sides of the road on the way to the village of @entity79			1
the @entity29 and the @entity30 are among the kitschy ornaments on the roofs of some			0
' drivers stop their cars next to the palaces and are always surprised by the fancy ideas that the owners dreamed up , ' said a man named @entity89 , a neighbour of the @entity2 families			1
a senior @entity11 police officer working in @entity94 told the @entity95 : ' it is an open secret that many of these properties were financed by crime , but as it was not crime in @entity11 there is little that can or is done about it , our resources are concentrated on tackling crime here			1
' we have had some raids on the gypsy clans engaging in child trafficking and prostitution as these are after all @entity11 citizens that were often the victims , but the begging gangs , the pickpockets and the scrap metal thieves that are all operating abroad , its hard to tackle these groups as at the end of the day cross border crime is very problematic to take action over			1
' if anything , the palaces should come under scrutiny from the @entity11 taxman which does periodically stages raids , these properties are after all conspicuous proof of possible undeclared income			1
' and they are also often built with very little regard to either planning permission or indeed the basic building safety requirements , which is the responsibility of the local councils			1
' both these bodies can and do take action , although so far it seems with little impact , given the way the properties are multiplying and spreading			0
' across @entity11 after the borders were opened , the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly			1
police believe most were constructed on the back of illicit criminal enterprises abroad checks carried out this month by employees of @entity39 revealed that more than 50 buildings in and around the city never had planning permission one of the car owners with is @entity5 registered car which he uses in @entity11 across @entity11 after the borders were opened , the gypsies who faced prejudice and abuse back home left to go abroad and not all were looking to earn money honestly			1
when some of them made vast amounts earned from everything from begging and pickpocketing , child trafficking and prostitution through to scrap metal theft , the slums were dismantled to make way for yet more palatial homes			0
with the lifting of restrictions to working in the @entity5 , more of these criminal gangs could be set to make their way to @entity174 under the pretence of ' looking for work '			2
the garish looking palatial type homes exude wealth via the brightly - coloured buildings with flamboyant decor , top of the range cars often with @entity5 number plates parked outside and gaudy statues filling the gardens			2
here there are no signs of the economic crisis which it is all too plain to see in many towns throughout the @entity5			0
looking around many of the streets are empty , there are not many people around , despite there being thousands registered as living in the area , not to mention the thousands more known to be living unregistered in the community - as is normal in @entity11 's @entity2 communities			2
people are reluctant to talk			0
the @entity2 community like to keep their business , and particularly their money making activities , a closely guarded secret			0
one of the few that spoke out told @entity95 : ' many of the people who live here are away on business			0
the men are often away for months on end			0
they go abroad in search of work i was told			0
i do n't know exactly what they do			0
we are not told much			0
some of those who raised their palaces around @entity47 and @entity48 were not even the rightful owners of the land on which they stand the palatial neighbourhood of @entity10 's gypsy palaces began to expand a decade ago and now includes a few dozen villas on both sides of the road on the way to the village of @entity79 ' i know they work in @entity174 , @entity231 and @entity232			1
for months they are gone and they send money back to their families here in the village			2
as you can see , a lot of money , that is what keeps the wealth growing here			0
' the village used to be small , when my family moved here , it used to be just scattered with caravans and not a lot else , but over the last decade the area has become more wealthy and huge houses have been built one after the other			2
' people are very proud of their houses , everyone wants their house to look bigger and better than their neighbours			0
' @entity258 is a very important thing in the community			0
of course they are worthless , no @entity11 would live in them , they are always built to look good , but the quality is rumoured to be bad			2
' a local gypsy , whose house is made of dried mud bricks on the outskirts of town , said			2
' there are honest people here , if you want to know who they are , look at the houses			0
