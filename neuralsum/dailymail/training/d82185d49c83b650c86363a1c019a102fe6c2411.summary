by @entity0 @entity1 , one of the park 's tigers easter egg hunters feared they had become the hunted after a ‘ tiger escape ’ alarm went off at a zoo			1
hundreds of people were ordered indoors as staff reacted to a ‘ code red ’ at @entity11 in @entity12			1
lunches were left on picnic benches and an easter egg hunt was abandoned as efforts were made to locate the most dangerous cats - two tigers and a puma			2
but it soon became clear that it was a false alarm and around 500 adults and children were able to go back to enjoying their day out			1
curator @entity23 said it became clear ‘ within minutes ’ that there was no risk to visitors on saturday			2
‘ the “ code red ” alarm set off by a member of the public means there are tigers out there and the whole park had to be evacuated , ’ she said			1
‘ they were either testing us to see how we would do or did it as a practical joke			2
‘ it was not done by accident			2
the button has a flap over it , so it was deliberate			0
but we did not catch the culprit			0
‘ it happened at the busiest point of the day , just after midday when we had started the @entity15			1
‘ we ’ve had three alarms go off that were n’t drills , which is not too bad considering that ’s since 2001			0
‘ we do drills four times a year but we were n’t scheduled to have one so all the staff treated it as if it was a real incident			0
‘ everyone in the park had to go into buildings			1
i was really impressed with the staff			0
‘ the public did superbly , although a few did n’t want to leave their picnics			1
’ she later explained the three previous alarms were not for genuine escapes but the result of mistakes by visitors			0
there are three alarm buttons at the park , pictured , and one was set off deliberately by a member of the public			1
the culprit has not been apprehended around 500 people had to be evacuated from @entity11 , pictured , but were soon let back in in one case an ‘ apologetic and embarrassed ’ parent admitted their young child had managed to push the button			1
there are three emergency panic buttons in public areas at the eight - acre site			1
each has a large sign with red letters that says ‘ emergency use only			0
use this button only in the event of seeing a tiger or puma out of its enclosure ’			0
the zoo ’s three big cats - tigers @entity1 and @entity100 and a puma called @entity102 - as well as three @entity104 lynx and two @entity106 wildcats			0
there are also primates , a tropical house and a nocturnal house with free - flying bats			0
