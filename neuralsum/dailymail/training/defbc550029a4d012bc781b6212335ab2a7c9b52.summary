by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 8 june 2013 the menagerie at the front of @entity4 ' house includes a horse , a cat , a dinosaur and a rabbit			1
and he finds the giant collection surprisingly easy to maintain			1
the retired tool hire businessman has spent the last 26 years becoming a master of topiary			1
a cut above the rest : retired businessman @entity4 tends to some of his huge topiary creations passion : mr @entity4 first began practising topiary when he moved to his home in the @entity21 in 1987 for the chop : the collection of topiary animals includes a cat , a swan , a dinosaur , a horse and a rabbit intricate : each sculpture takes mr @entity4 years of growing and trimming to perfect the 70 - year - old from @entity32 , @entity21 , said his interest was first sparked by a neighbour 's horse			1
he said : ' in 1987 i moved to a house with many hedges and a large garden			2
' my son , @entity40 , had taken up horse riding and i became fascinated with the shape and dimensions of horses			2
' luckily a neighbour 's horse , @entity47 , was prepared to model for me for the modest fee of a few carrots and i was able to attempt life - size topiary			0
' the topiary horse was created by reshaping an existing hedge into the main body and head			0
then the front legs were planted separately and grown to join into the body			0
during the four years it took to create the horse it was suggested that the it needed a rider , so a man was grown , leaning against the opposite gatepost			2
inspiration : the idea for creating animals was sparked by mr @entity4 ' interest in a neighbour 's horse patience : the triceratops is 12ft long and 6ft high and took six years to complete work in progress : mr @entity4 is currently in the midst of creating a huge human face the life - sized man , a watchful jockey , stands at the front of mr @entity4 ' house			1
since then , more pieces have appeared including a swan , cats , rabbits and a human face is currently being carved			0
but mr @entity4 says he is most proud of a 12ft - long triceratops which took six years of craft			1
he said : ' the strange thing is that i initially started carving a cow - but then changed my mind halfway through its completion			0
' i 'm glad that i changed my mind as the dinosaur is a lot more unique and people are amazed when they first see it			0
' the plant that he uses is a @entity94 , which grows very quickly and is very tolerant and easy to root			1
he added : ' topiary is a relaxing and rewarding pastime and everyone can do it			0
' the advantage of topiary over other types of sculpture is that , unlike carving wood or chiseling marble , if a bit too much is accidently lopped off , it will regrow next year			0
