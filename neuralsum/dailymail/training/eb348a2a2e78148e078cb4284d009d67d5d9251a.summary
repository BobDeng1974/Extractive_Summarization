by @entity0 published : 23:42 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 3 january 2013 pride : @entity2 has donated money for the lost palace of @entity6 prince @entity5 hollywood star @entity2 has given a boost to efforts to preserve the site of the ' lost palace ' of ancient @entity6 princes			1
@entity2 , 43 , made a ' substantial ' donation to a trust bidding to buy up farmland thought to be the site where the last independent rulers of @entity6 had their royal residence			2
the 700 - year - old lost palace of @entity5 and his grandson @entity18 is believed to have stood in what is now mostly fields			1
and now the @entity22 plans to erect a public monument to the @entity6 princes at the farmland in @entity25 , @entity26			2
trustee @entity27 said : ' the home of the @entity6 princes of @entity6 , has been ignored for far too long			0
' the trustees are delighted that @entity2 is taking a personal interest in the work of the trust			0
' her involvement will undoubtedly help to raise the profile of this @entity6 project internationally			0
he added : ' the historical and archaeological evidence is overwhelming and we want to ensure its guaranteed preservation for the benefit of present and future generations			0
' former @entity45 star @entity44 is also keen on backing efforts to buy the 29 acres of land from the current owners			1
the ancient palace was , according to legend , situated at the place where an mansion called @entity53 - dating back to 1624 itself - now stands			0
while the stories told locally were sometimes doubted by historians , a number of archaeological digs were carried out over the past few years suggesting that there was indeed a large complex of buildings on the site , including an impressive great hall , supporting the idea that @entity65 was indeed the location of a palace			2
it seems to have been one of the final strongholds of the independent princes of @entity6 , as @entity5 the last spent time there before his death at the decisive @entity74 in 1282 , which handed control of the country to @entity78 's @entity77 the mansion 's current occupier @entity79 said : ' the locals have always called the house @entity83 and it seems this local lore has been handed down over the centuries			1
' it 's great that @entity2 is showing an interest			0
' majestic : @entity53 , which dates back to 1624 and is known locally as @entity90 's @entity89 the landscape of @entity65 in @entity26 is now the site of a @entity94 manor house - but in the medieval period , it is believed to have been home to the last independent princes of @entity6			1
one of the princes to have maintained a palace there was @entity5 ( pictured right on his deathbed in 1240 ) , probably the most powerful ruler in @entity6 's history , who successfully resisted efforts by @entity105 and @entity106 to expand their @entity78 kingdom into @entity6 during the early 13th century			1
his grandson , known as @entity18 , is recorded as sending letters from @entity65 , which appears to have been one of the final strongholds of his vanishing lands			0
however , @entity5 was killed at the @entity74 in 1282 , leading to the takeover of @entity6 by @entity77 and its subsequent absorption into the @entity78 kingdom			0
the conquest of @entity6 brought an end to the royal connections of @entity65 , and historians have since doubted that it was in fact the spot where @entity5 held court - but recent archaeological digs proved that a great hall once stood on the site , bolstering its claims to palatial status .			1
