a pair of gutsy acrobats have crossed @entity3 's awe - inspiring @entity2 on a tightrope			2
@entity5 from @entity6 and @entity7 from @entity8 completed the 328ft crossing on a slack line , after negotiating with officials for several months to get permission			1
they both made the crossing without falling off , ultimately not using the safety cords attached to the line			1
mr @entity5 told @entity17 : ' here you have a lot of spray , a lot of water in the air , floating beside you , splashing your face and it 's intimidating on the one side but also distracting			1
' mr @entity7 added : ' optically it 's very difficult because the spray comes from the sides and it 's like waves , they try to drag you , so it 's really difficult for the optics and obviously everything is very heavy because it 's soaked with water			1
' while it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world , it is classified as the largest , based on its width of 5,604ft and height of 354ft			2
mr @entity7 said : ' everything is very heavy because it 's soaked with water ' the pair negotiated with officials for several months to get permission to do the daredevil stunt they both made the crossing without falling off , ultimately not using the safety cords attached to the line eight days ago @entity66 completed two death - defying high - wire walks between skyscrapers at an intense incline , and then with a blindfold on a cable suspended more than 500ft over the @entity73			1
footage of the astonishing feat ran on a 10 - second delay on the @entity77 so producers could cut away if he fell to his death			0
he had neither a net nor a harness as he completed the challenge - and had said his only back - up plan was to attempt to kneel and cling to the wire with his feet			0
brave : @entity66 successfully walked over the @entity73 between two skyscrapers - the rope had an incline of eight stories blinded : @entity66 had set up a speaker making ' ping ' noises at his destination so he knew where he was aiming while blindfolded he finished the first portion of the stunt in six minutes , 52 seconds , and made the second , blindfolded walk in just one minute , 17 seconds			0
the first wire was suspended more than 500ft above the @entity73 at a 19 - degree incline			0
the wire was supposed to be suspended at 15 degrees , but a last minute change made for an even steeper challenge			0
he broke two @entity108 world records in the process - for the highest inclined tightrope walk , and the highest blindfolded walk .			0
