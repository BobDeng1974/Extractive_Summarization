the likes of @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 may be huge @entity6 stars now , but at one point they would have all been struggling actors hoping to get their big break			1
and for many young actors a job in an advertisement was the best way to make a quick buck whilst they waited for @entity15 to call			1
sporting a curly mop , the ' acne - prone ' @entity38 is distressed with his complexion , and is shown solemnly smearing the @entity28 pads on his face with a deadpan expression			2
in the next shot , he is back to wreaking havoc on the streets with a cheesy grin			2
@entity3 32 - year - old brunette beauty @entity3 may have won an @entity47 for her role in @entity49 , but before @entity6 blockbusters were a regular part of her schedule she was starring in adverts for regional phone company , @entity54			1
@entity55 is seen cringing after a date as she calls her friend on a multi-line phone , while her onscreen mother natters away on another line			0
in case you were wondering , her ' date ' does eventually call			0
@entity3 was in a tv ad for internet phone company , @entity54 , in the late nineties this awkward date advert would have come about 15 years before @entity3 's @entity47 success @entity2 it might be impossible to imagine the established 40 - year - old actor as anything but one of the @entity6 greats , but @entity74 star used to make his money in bubblegum adverts			1
with a high - pitched voice , bouncy curtains and a goofy checkered blazer , little 14 - year - old @entity2 is seen popping gum and rocking out in front of a large hi - fi system			1
curtain call ! @entity2 at the age of 14 in an advert for @entity86 bubblegum in 1988 ( left ) and now as a 40 - year - old before his big break , the four - time @entity47 - nominated actor used to advertise gum @entity90 almost unrecognisable sporting an uncontrollable perm , the @entity92 and @entity93 actress @entity90 starred in an @entity96 advert for @entity98 tampons in the @entity99			1
she awkwardly deals with an array of puberty difficulties : her bothersome younger brother , her irritated complexion , but according to the advert , one thing that does n't bother her is her ' time of month '			0
@entity90 would have been about 16 at the time that this advert came out			0
cue tons of cheesy grins and wide collar suits from a now 46 - year - old @entity90			0
check out that perm ! @entity90 starred in a tampon commercial for @entity98 in the 1980s the clip features tons of @entity99 clichés including hair bows and wide - collar suits @entity1 before he became a hot commodity in @entity6 and one half of the power couple that is ' @entity120 ' , @entity1 , now 51 , was out patrolling the streets looking for @entity123 - popping ladies to impress , or so this commercial shows			0
@entity1 sports a golden tan and cavorts with his ' jock ' friends in a yellow convertible ; he would have been about 25 years of age			0
with no dialogue , @entity1 can only showcase his acting prowess by munching the crisps in a ecstatic manner			0
@entity1 featured in a cheesy advert for @entity136 crisps in 1988			0
he is one of three topless men in the video the famous @entity6 actor would have been just 25 - years - old at the time and still trying to catch his lucky break @entity142 she may be widely recognised as stake - toting high - kicking @entity143 , but 38 - year - old @entity142 started her career as a child actor , and starred in @entity147 's first ever televised advert in 1981			2
pictured in sweet lavender dungarees and ribbon - held bunches , four - year - old @entity142 sits on a picnic bench in an idyllic town and weighs up @entity147 's benefits against @entity154 's disadvantages			2
in a endearing voice she pips : ' i go to @entity147 ! ' fast - food slayer @entity142 in a @entity147 in 1981 at only four years old @entity158 considering his now - legendary status following a starring role in @entity161 ( he counts stars like @entity163 and @entity164 as fans ) , @entity158 's @entity99 hemorrhoids advert is certainly one of the most embarrassing			2
@entity158 , now 59 , walks up to the camera in a retro suit and holds up a tub of hemorrhoid cream , raving about ' hemorrhoidal tissue ' and the cream 's beneficial qualities			1
in the early 1980s @entity158 starred in a commercial for a hemorrhoid cream @entity176 around 25 years or so before breaking bad success @entity179 before 52 - year - old ghost actress @entity179 had the @entity6 body everyone aspired to achieve , she starred as a less polished youth in sultry @entity183 adverts			1
with soft jazz music playing , a shoulder - padded @entity179 has an almost fatal incident with a @entity186 can , but which ultimately leads her to meeting a handsome gentleman			0
@entity179 would have been about 26 years old at the time			0
actress @entity179 featured in a @entity188 in 1988 @entity189 now a twice @entity47 - winning actor / director , 42 - year - old @entity189 has certainly come a long way since his fast - food days			1
the advert shows @entity189 sporting a bouncy quiff , bomber jacket and bleached denim , patrolling the streets in a car with a vintage in - built phone			1
the actor would have only been about 17 at the time			0
a few cheesy hair - grooming moments and a case of mistaken identity later and he 's picking up a @entity206 for his female interest			2
but before long is called home by his dad for his curfew			0
in 1989 @entity189 was in a @entity147 commercial			1
he would have been about 17 at the time @entity212 it 's hard to imagine 60 - year - old @entity214 actor @entity212 shimmying down the street in a white baggy suit with three supermodels , but in the @entity221 his advert for @entity220 's @entity219 tells a different story			2
the actor would have been around 32 years of age and is pictured playfully skipping and twirling with the ladies			0
he is eventually seen sporting a sleeveless t - shirt and enthusiastically playing the harmonica			0
before his action - packed glory days , @entity212 made his name in an advert for @entity220 's @entity219 in 1987			2
this was about a year before he appeared in his career - making lead role in @entity214 @entity4 four years before @entity4 , now 31 , got her big break in sitcom @entity236 , and several years before she was crowned @entity238 's @entity237 , she was just another girl who liked to play with dolls - and starred in an advert for @entity241 in 1994			1
11 - year - old @entity4 is seen fresh - faced with a plait in her long hair , sporting a pink turtleneck and excitedly gazing at the doll that can have glitter combed into its locks			1
@entity248 - nis ? @entity4 used to star in commercials such as this one for @entity241 in 1994 , when she was about 11 years old			1

@entity2 , @entity4 , @entity189 and @entity3 all appeared in advertisements as young actors
