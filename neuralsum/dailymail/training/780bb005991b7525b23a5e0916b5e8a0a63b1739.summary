@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			0
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			0
@entity10 that challenge on @entity12 , which fractured a vertebra in his spine , was done with only one thing in mind – to hurt him			1
with no chance of getting hurt himself and the referee in a difficult position to see any tackle , @entity19 's @entity18 kneed @entity12 in the lower back and kidney area to get him out of the game			1
a blow to that area hurts , believe me			0
massive loss : @entity32 will be without their start man @entity12 after this tackle ended his @entity35 end of the line : @entity12 is carried down the tunnel with his @entity35 over pain : the challenge left @entity12 writhing on the ground and a out of the remainder of the tournament @entity44 ready to fill @entity12 's boots mistakes : @entity47 may have scored a stunning free - kick against @entity19 but defensively he is a danger it will be a big blow for @entity32 to lose their one and only player with real @entity55 flair and i very much doubt they can go on to win the @entity35 without him			1
i 'm still waiting for @entity47 to make that game - changing mistake which costs the team			1
and without @entity12 they will have no - one to save him			1
@entity62 @entity32 have been getting a lot of stick for their aggressive , tough - tackling performances in this tournament			1
in the old days , their pacey attacking full backs would be up and down the flanks , overlapping , their socks around their ankles and too tight shorts			0
@entity32 have always been very competitive , very tenacious and full - on , but the difference is they always had players with proper passing ability that could entertain - and at times mesmerise - which they are lacking now			1
reducer : @entity82 was notable for his hatchet job on star @entity85 @entity84 on friday night decent dogs : @entity87 , @entity82 ( both left ) and @entity89 ( right ) are a solid , unspectacular midfield instead , they have a pack of decent dogs in their central midfield , quick into the tackle , incisive and destructive			0
they 've played @entity87 , @entity82 and @entity89 in their defensive midfield duo in this @entity35 and , although people are complaining about their aggressive attitude and style of play , it 's got them to the semi-final so far			2
@entity103 's gamble @entity104 i see some people have questioned @entity108 's gamble to put @entity109 in for the penalty shoot - out against @entity111			1
they have been saying what about the other goalkeeper ? how 's it going to affect his confidence ? how 's it going to affect him for the next round ? @entity109 ending : the @entity121 substitute keeper came on to save twice during the penalty shoot - out big call : @entity108 made a brave decision and he was rewarded with a place in the @entity35 semi-finals quite right : questions have been asked about the effect on @entity129 but a manager ca n't think like that when you 're a manager , you ca n't ever have that frame of mind , you ca n’t choose not to make a decision because it might upset someone			1
how ridiculous would that be ? @entity109 's record , as we all know now , is n't great on penalties			1
before that game he 'd stopped just two of 20			0
but the @entity143 players would 've taken note of the change of keeper and they would no doubt have wobbled , knowing that he 's been put in especially for this decisive part of the match			2
anyone who is questioning @entity108 – you must be mad			1
@entity152 @entity153 is not a @entity155 player			1
i 'm sure @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 would 've been shaking their heads when he walked through the door last year			0
he is nasty , he is horrible to play against and he hurts people			0
make no mistake , he can be very , very effective			0
he is good at attacking and defending set plays and is strong in a very direct style of play			2
out of place : @entity153 can be effective but he is too niggly to be a @entity155 player but that is not @entity155			1
i ca n't think for one moment that @entity153 would be at all bothered if @entity108 called him into his office when he 's back from the @entity35 and said , ' you 're not for me , you can leave			1
' i 'm sure @entity153 would smile , shake his hand and say no problem			2
he will be sitting on a treasure chest of money owed to him			0
i 'm sure he 's wealthy already , but with players ' contracts the signing on fees would have to be paid			2
money talks : if @entity108 wants to get rid of the @entity186 it will cost a lot to end the long - term contract if they really do want him out , he and his agent can negotiate a settlement on his contract and salary owed which will make him a very , very rich young man			1
my week ... we started pre-season training last thursday at @entity6 and for the first time in 17 years of football management i 've got barely any staff			0
two players called @entity201 and @entity202 are helping me here and there with the training			0
both blokes are proper men , who 've had good careers and have maximised the football ability that they were blessed with			2
helping out : goalkeeper @entity201 is helping out with the coaching this season at @entity6 they 've had promotions , they 've had ups and downs and they are both good family people			0
i 've gambled on having less staff so that their potential wages can go to bringing in new players and paying better wages the only other staff member i 've got is a young physio called @entity220 from the youth team			0
at the end of the day , you can have the best coach , the best assistant manager , the best analysts , the best sports scientists , the best training ground and the best pair of boots , but if your players are rubbish it 's all worth nothing			0
my old boss @entity232 always , always said it 's all about players and getting good players in			2
now the challenge is to get two or three more in so that the next 10 months will be special .			0

@entity18 's knee on @entity12 could only have been to hurt @entity239
without @entity32 have no - one to save them when @entity47 slips up
@entity108 's @entity109 decision should silence any doubters
@entity153 is n't good enough for @entity155
