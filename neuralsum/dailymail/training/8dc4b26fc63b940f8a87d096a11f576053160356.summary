by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has urged his @entity4 under 21 squad to use @entity5 as an example of the rewards possible for young players in the national system			1
@entity2 ’s group for tonight ’s @entity12 qualifier with @entity13 is inexperienced for this level , as @entity15 has taken some key figures			1
@entity19 defender @entity17 is on stand - by for the @entity20 while @entity21 and @entity22 are in his 23 - man squad for @entity24			1
moving up : @entity2 wants @entity4 's under - 21 players to use @entity5 as an example pleasure : @entity2 , whose team are sailing through qualifying , said it was a pleasure to work with @entity17 @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41			1
tv : live on @entity43 1 from 7pm ( kick - off 7.30pm )			2
while @entity45 winger @entity21 and @entity46 left - back @entity22 have not played for the @entity47 since november , @entity17 has been an integral figure and was outstanding in the 1 - 0 win over @entity13 in march			1
stones would have played in the return fixture in @entity52 then gone on to the @entity53 , and while @entity2 is disappointed to lose a player of his quality he believes the 19 - year - old is a success story for what the @entity58 are trying to achieve			1
‘ @entity5 has emerged from our programme of the under 20s @entity20 last year and been outstanding for us this season , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ his composure on the ball is fantastic , we ’re looking for defenders to play out			0
‘ his experience at full back probably helped that			0
like any centre back he will have to learn the defensive positioning but nothing fazes him			0
@entity21 and @entity22 we have had less of			0
they are in their first team anyway and it ’s been a different process			2
commanding : stones ' form for @entity19 has been superb , and resulted in an @entity4 call - up ‘ but the one that most pleased me was @entity5			1
it is probably one that for club and country worked really nicely			0
the relationship we had with @entity85 ( @entity86 ) and @entity87 ( @entity88 ) hopefully played a part in that			0
‘ in the end it is down to the player and his fantastic attitude and his desire to keep learning			0
i have spoken with him and i expect he will go on to @entity97 with the seniors and then see what happens			0
it is a pleasure to work with boys like him			0
’ @entity4 have breezed through the qualification process so far under @entity2 and they only need four points from their final three away fixtures against @entity13 , @entity105 and @entity106 to finish top of @entity108			1
‘ we have to just focus on winning the game and playing in the style we want to , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ we had a tough game against @entity13 in @entity112			2
the way they set up made it difficult for us			0

@entity4 under 21s take on @entity13 on *monday* night
@entity2 says his team will miss the likes of @entity5
@entity19 defender is on standby for @entity4 @entity20 squad
