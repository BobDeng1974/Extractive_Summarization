the @entity1 newspaper that sparked controversy after publishing the names and addresses of nearby gun permit owners is now taking up arms in an apparent response to threats			1
the @entity9 has reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper 's headquarters in @entity14			1
the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity19 and @entity20 counties just north of @entity21 in an interactive map on its website			1
targeted : the @entity9 published the names and addresses of people in the area with legal gun licenses the @entity29 reported on tuesday that @entity9 editor @entity30 hired gun - toting security guards to patrol the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			1
the paper hired the increased security from @entity39 , a firm based in @entity41 that provides services like protection and security guard certification , according to the @entity29			2
the news came just days after the @entity9 announced plans to publish an expanded list of even more permit - holding locals			1
along with an article entitled ' the gun owner next door : what you do n't know about the weapons in your neighborhood , ' the @entity9 map was compiled in response to the december 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in @entity61 , @entity62 , editors of the @entity65 - owned newspaper said			1
naming names : the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of pistol permit holders in suburban @entity19 and @entity20 counties just north of @entity21 in an interactive map on its website the next batch of names will be permit holders in suburban @entity76 , @entity21 , where the county clerk told the newspaper it is still compiling information			1
some 44,000 people are licensed to own pistols in the three counties , the newspaper said			0
owners of rifles and shotguns do not need permits , the newspaper said			2
the publication prompted outrage , particularly on social media sites , among gun owners			1
' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? ' @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103 , posted on the newspaper 's web site			0
' what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			0
' @entity109 state senator @entity108 of @entity110 , @entity21 , said he planned to introduce legislation to keep permit information private except to prosecutors and police			2
calling for change : the paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the @entity61 shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood , and there were protests across the country ( pictured ) a similar bill that he introduced earlier as an assemblyman failed in the @entity129			2
' the asinine editors at the @entity9 have once again gone out of their way to place a virtual scarlet letter on law abiding firearm owners throughout the region , ' @entity108 wrote on his @entity137 web site			1
the newspaper 's editor and vice president of news , @entity140 , earlier in the week defended the decision to list the permit holders			0
' we knew publication of the database would be controversial , but we felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity61 shootings , ' she said			1
some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			0
@entity157 , a journalism professor at the @entity158 at @entity159 , called the critics ' response childish and petulant			0
on the list : as well as @entity9 the website @entity164 published a 446 - page list of licensed gun owners in @entity21 ' it does n't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion , ' he said			1
' instead , it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting			0
' @entity157 said the information about permit holders was public and , if presented in context , served a legitimate interest			0
but media critic @entity182 of the @entity184 - based @entity183 wrote online this week that the newspaper 's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit holders ' loss of privacy			0
' if journalists could show flaws in the gun permitting system , that would be newsworthy , ' he said			0
' or , for example , if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political connections , then journalists could better justify the privacy invasion			2
' @entity182 said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears			0
' the net effect of the abuse of public records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening records , which would be the biggest mistake of all , ' he said .			0
