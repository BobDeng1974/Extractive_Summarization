@entity0 : @entity1 , pictured here as he looks today , was once the face of the gay conversion therapy movement a man who was once one of the most visible advocates of so - called gay conversion therapy has now come out as still gay			1
you might call @entity1 ex- ex-gay			2
in 1998 , he appeared on the cover of @entity11 alongside his wife			1
the headline asked ‘ @entity14 ? ’ now estranged from his wife and sporting a much less conservative look , including long blond hair and a deep tan , @entity15 seems to have the answer			2
and if you have n’t figured it out , it ’s a yes			0
‘ my beliefs have changed , ’ @entity15 told @entity26 , which stands for @entity27			0
‘ today , i do not consider myself “ ex-gay ” and i no longer support or promote the movement			0
’ this is a huge departure from @entity15 ’s prime ex-gay days , when he founded and ran a ministry called @entity37 based on what he called ‘ reparative therapy			1
’ the psychology community would now , as much of it did back then , be quick to balk at the idea of using therapy to change one ’s sexual orientation			2
but @entity15 was a true spokesman for the technique and was even chairman of the board of @entity50 , one of the most well - none ex-gay organizations			0
@entity15 also penned two books on the subject : not afraid to change : the @entity55 and @entity37 , which he wrote with his wife , who also claimed to have rid herself of her own homosexuality			2
then : in 1998 , @entity15 appeared on the cover of @entity11 touting his belief in conversion therapy and ran a christian ministry based on those beliefs change of mind : mr @entity1 , right , is pictured in drag for a 1990s photoshoot after his conversion he remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until september of 2000 , when it was widely reported that the self - proclaimed born - again heterosexual was seen living it up in a @entity75 gay bar			1
now , the 50 - year - old says he ’s come along way and apologized for harm he ’s done to people close to him and to the lgbt community as a whole			0
changed : @entity15 wrote two books on gay conversion with wife @entity85 , pictured , but now makes his living in the catering business ‘ please allow me to be clear , ’ @entity15 said			1
‘ i do not believe that reparative therapy changes sexual orientation ; in fact , it does great harm to many people			1
’ he later said : ‘ i know that countless people were harmed by things i said and did in the past			0
’ @entity15 ’s wife @entity98 , according to @entity27 , remains a vocal proponent within the ‘ reparative therapy ’ movement today			1
@entity15 now supports himself in the food service industry , running a catering company in @entity105 , @entity106 called @entity107 , and says he no longer profits from his former job			1
‘ i do n’t get any royalties from these publications , ’ he told @entity26			0
‘ i discourage anyone from purchasing and selling these books or promoting my “ ex-gay ” story because they do not reflect who i am now or what i believe today			0
