by @entity0 having slogged his way around the lower leagues for 25 years , @entity1 has suddenly become popular and fashionable after taking @entity4 into the promised land of the @entity6			1
he has been granted the flattering nickname ‘ @entity8 ’ , while agents have been bombarding him all summer with phone calls , faxes and emails because he has money to burn			1
or at least that ’s what they think			2
the reality is a little different as @entity1 is keen to point out in a typically forthright way			1
@entity8 : @entity4 manager @entity1 is determined to succeed in the @entity6 on the up : @entity1 led @entity4 to promotion to the @entity6 against all the odds last season ‘ one agent sent a message to tell me his player was available at € 15million and wanted £ 45,000 - a - week salary , net , ’ he says			1
‘ my reply was two words : “ wrong club			2
” ‘ i was thinking , at least do your homework			2
it ’s not going to happen at that level at @entity4			1
i ’m not stupid and i know we ’ve got to be competitive but would i do that and rip the heart out of the club ? no , it ’s not my style			2
’ it ’s neat symmetry that 24 hours after @entity6 superstars like @entity42 and @entity43 do battle in tonight ’s @entity45 , @entity1 will take his assortment of youngsters , journeymen and cut - price signings to @entity50 for a pre-season training camp he hopes will get them ready for the toughest challenge of their lives			1
whereas @entity57 bought @entity58 for £ 35m this week , @entity1 ’s five summer signings so far have cost £ 2m : @entity59 ( £ 1.5m ) , @entity60 ( £ 500,000 ) and freebies @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
survival looks impossible until you start listening to @entity1			1
firstly , he tells you @entity4 were sixth - favourites to be relegated from @entity68 last season and had only 18 outfield players to choose from			1
@entity71 : @entity59 celebrates scoring the goal which ensured promotion for @entity4 last season signings : @entity1 has only spent £ 2m on the signings of @entity60 ( left ) , @entity62 ( centre ) , @entity61 ( right ) as well as @entity63 and @entity59 secondly , @entity78 and @entity79 showed that , with the right attitude and spirit , anything is possible			1
@entity79 were written off like @entity4 and finished 11th in last season ’s @entity6			1
most importantly , @entity1 wo n’t allow his squad - whose crown jewels are @entity88 under - 21 striker @entity84 and £ 5million - rated defender @entity85 - to feel any fear			1
‘ we are leaving @entity4 - world and going into the reality of @entity6 - world but it ’s not scary , ’ he insists			1
‘ i know if you catch some of those top boys like @entity42 and @entity58 when they are on a hot day , you can get badly hurt			2
but without being disrespectful , they are still human			2
they have ups and downs , no player no matter how valuable can be a magician every single week			2
‘ we are built on a real group mentality rather than individuals			2
if we bought one big star you ’d get this weird thing in the camp			0
you ’d have baggage of all the players who have done well for you whose contracts are nowhere near that of the signing you ’ve just made			0
‘ it would hurt us so , if my chairman came to me and said “ look , we will buy that £ 20m player ” , i would say i do n’t think it is appropriate for this club at this time			1
it would harm the group and unquestionably we have talent here already			0
’ big money : @entity57 have just spent £ 35m on @entity58 but @entity1 will not spend beyond @entity4 's means emulate : @entity1 wants to repeat the achievements of @entity78 and @entity79 by staying up star men : @entity4 's @entity127 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) could be pivotal to survival success @entity4 have been here before of course			1
they were in the @entity6 in 2009/10 and famously beat @entity130 at @entity131 early in the season			0
but manager @entity133 jumped ship for @entity135 midway through the campaign and they were relegated			0
now given a second chance , @entity4 could make as much as £ 120m from promotion			1
@entity1 is adamant it wo n’t be frittered away , and knows all about getting value for money after a 17 - year playing career in the lower echelons with @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , and a short managerial stint at @entity148			1
‘ one of the first things we did at @entity4 this summer was to get the diggers in to lay new fibre sand - based training pitches			1
the weather up here means we need them , trust me			0
‘ they turn a tap on at the end of october and do n’t turn it off again until the end of march			0
our pitches down the bottom end of the training ground got waterlogged last season and were unusable			0
it ’s a miracle my hair is still ginger			0
’ @entity168 , the hair			0
@entity1 ’s short , red hair and beard , coupled with a voice that is a permanent rasp , mean he is set to be one of the cult figures in the new @entity6 season			1
do n't write us off : the work ethic which @entity1 demands from his players could help keep @entity4 up under - stated : @entity1 will not get carried away by @entity4 's success last season and will look to progress even friends like @entity182 boss @entity181 , who worked with @entity1 at @entity148 , now refers to him as the ‘ @entity8 ’			1
@entity1 will meet the real one when @entity4 face @entity183 on the opening weekend of the season			1
‘ it ’s just banter , is n’t it ? ’ smiles @entity1			2
‘ my mates give me some stick about the name but it ’s just a bit of fun			0
if i do half as well as him i ’ll be all right			0
‘ what i will say is that we are very aligned with the culture and environment we have built for the players and i do n’t think that can change in any successful organisation			0
’ two days in @entity50 have been set aside from regular football practise			0
one will deal with physical endurance , the other mental toughness			0
last summer , the players were driven to the point of exhaustion pushing giant tyres at an army boot camp			2
when they were on their knees , @entity1 ordered them to sprint for 60 seconds			2
‘ we knew we had a small group and challenges would come our way where they would be tested to the limit but we had the experience of pre-season to fall back on , ’ he explains			0
‘ the base requirement for a footballer is that you have to be physically and mentally strong , never more so than in the @entity6 where you are under constant scrutiny			0
‘ but out of six weeks ’ pre-season , it ’s only two days			0
the rest of the time it ’s football , football , football			0
‘ people have pre-conceptions about me because of my appearance , they think i must shout and bawl at my players , but that is so far from the reality			0
‘ i like to give the players lots of information about what we do			0
that ’s the way i wanted managers and coaches to treat me when i was a player – but it did n’t often happen			0
’ apprenticeship : @entity1 enjoyed a playing career in the lower leagues before becoming a manager with @entity148			1

@entity1 slogged around in the lower leagues for 25 years before promotion
he has been granted the flattering nickname ' @entity8 '
@entity1 says he will tell his chairman not to spend *excessively* on signings
his five summer signings have totalled just £ *2million* in value
@entity4 can repeat success of @entity78 and @entity79 says @entity1
