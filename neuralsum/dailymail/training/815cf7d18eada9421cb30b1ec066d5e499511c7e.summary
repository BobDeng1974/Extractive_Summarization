these giant symbols etched into the desert are a welcoming message to aliens from @entity5 's deeply secretive @entity4			2
the religion , which believes a sinister extraterrestrial being called @entity8 brought billions of people to earth in spaceships similar to @entity13 airliners , operates a giant underground base hidden deep within the @entity16 desert			1

welcome to earth : the huge symbol etched into the desert in @entity16 next to the @entity24 base dubbed the ' alien space cathedral ' the strange symbols sit on top of a rock formation in @entity16 where the @entity4 has built an enormous underground bunker hidden some 30 miles from the nearest town , the base is reportedly home to a huge underground bunker , built in the 1980 's and strong enough to withstand a nuclear holocaust			1

a report in the @entity48 newspaper tells how @entity17 visited the site , known as @entity50 , and interviewed former members of the @entity4 for the new book @entity53			1
mr @entity17 , who the church has previously described as ' a bigot , a liar and psychotic ' said : ' i 'd alway wanted to visit @entity50 because when you go to the church they always deny this talk of @entity8 and space aliens			1
' when i spoke to @entity64 and @entity65 in 2007 and asked them ' who is @entity8 ? ' they 'd say " @entity17 , you 're crazy "			1
' but if i 'm wrong about the church believing in aliens , then why have they built these giant symbols in the middle of the desert that can only be seen from outer space ? ' i think there is something very strange about a church which builds an enormous cathedral but then hides it away from everyone			1
' what concerns me is that @entity24 says it wants religious status in the @entity83			2
but our rules state religions must be open and honest about their beliefs and i think these are good rules			0
' this place is physical proof that they do believe in aliens			2
i 'd like to see @entity5 and @entity92 explain why they hide this from people			0
' the symbols , which consist of two interlinking circles with diamonds in the centre , are reportedly there to guide @entity19 returning to earth after fleeing to outer space to escape armageddon			1

he writes : ' i press an intercom button			0
a voice says “ @entity131 ” in what sounds like a @entity130 accent			0
i announce that i ’m @entity17 and ask nicely for a tour			2
' we are not invited in and the intercom simply spouts white noise			0
we drive back to civilisation , wondering what kind of religion builds a space alien cathedral underground			0
' the reporter claims he received two mysterious phone calls to his hotel room at 1am that night for which he believes @entity19 were responsible			1
mr @entity144 , who was brought up inside the church from the age of six , has written the book @entity111 : inside the @entity147			2
in it he reveals how the church 's e-meter devices , which are used to measure the static electric field around a person , cost just $ 40 to make but are sold for $ 4,000 ( £ 2,400 )			0

@entity18 reporter @entity17 , who famously clashed with @entity19 during a @entity21 report in 2007 , travelled to the @entity50 while researching a new book he said : ' five years ago , i spent weeks at the centre of the church ’s attention			1

strangers spied on my wedding and knocked on the doors of my neighbours			0
' in the end , i lost it on camera , doing a good impression of an exploding tomato			0
' in the 21st century , everyone has a right to believe in anything , or nothing			0
but not everything that claims to be a religion is a religion			0
it could be , for example , a brain - washing cult			0
' for a start , a religion must be honest about what it believes in			0
@entity19 believe in a space alien satan called @entity8 — but if you ask them , their spokesmen deny it			1
' a spokesman for @entity24 said the giant markings are merely the corporate logo of the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) which are used to help pilots find the airstrip			2

the spokesman said : ' the facility in @entity16 is one of the archival storage sites containing preservation copies of mr. @entity42 ’s writings and lectures			2
' the symbol carved in the hillside near the facility is @entity202 ’s corporate logo			0
