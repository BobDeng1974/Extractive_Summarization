by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			2
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
this week , @entity10 talks about the first time he ever laid eyes on @entity14 , how @entity15 should be the man to leave @entity16 and why he believes @entity17 may be picked over @entity18 in @entity21 's @entity20 squad			1
four years ago on a cold , wet saturday morning i stood next to @entity23 watching the @entity25 youth team play @entity26 underneath the flight path into @entity28			1
i was there to see my son @entity30 play for @entity26			2
potential : @entity14 produced a stunning over-head kick when he was just 14 years old international : he has already made his @entity21 debut and may get another opportunity this week @entity23 told me he 'd come to watch a young player and he pointed to a boy who was very small , very quick – with lightning acceleration – and very skilful			1
but he looked totally uninterested and during the game had no final product			1
over the years we 've all seen the super-quick boys at 14 , 15 and 16 fade away			2
as other lads grow stronger and faster , those teenagers who used to be rapid just flitter away			2
between @entity23 and myself we commented that he just looked average and was nothing special			0
at 0 - 0 , with 10 minutes to go , @entity23 was about to leave when the boy , who was only about 14 , was moved to centre forward			1
184181 173825 131867 69591 69637 111340 new generation : @entity14 and young @entity47 midfielder @entity46 are @entity21 hopefuls @entity49 and behold , the @entity25 right back bombed down the wing and got to the byline , from where he floated a cross beyond the near post defender towards the penalty spot			1
in an instant the boy changed direction from the edge of the six yard box , running away from goal and the monster @entity26 centre back towards the penalty spot			2
as the ball floated in the air the boy executed an astonishing over-head kick that smashed into the stanchion in the back of the net			1
the goalkeeper did n't even move an inch			0
everyone who was watching clapped , including myself and @entity23			2
we both looked at each other and smiled , and @entity23 took a note of the name			0
it was none other than @entity14			1
what a shame that @entity83 beat @entity25 to it and signed him			0
lightning : the @entity83 winger has been a revelation since his reintroduction into the side the comments on @entity93 tv by @entity15 that his team - mates are getting in his way and going into his positions are typical of the @entity93 mentality that we 've seen throughout their @entity20 campaigns			1
we 've seen players getting sent home for disagreeing with the manager , players getting sent home because they 've complained they 're not playing and players getting sent home because they 're not happy with the bonuses			0
it 's a very fine line between confidence and arrogance			0
can you imagine @entity113 's face when he read those comments ? clearly @entity115 wants out			0
aged 30 and with a poor injury record he 's the first one who should be shown the exit door in the summer			0
quite clearly that type of attitude rubs off on the rest and there will be factions and cliques at @entity16 moaning and complaining , talking about how sir @entity125 used to do it this way or that way			1
anger : @entity15 must want to leave @entity16 after his recent comments beaten : @entity115 missed a simple chance to get @entity16 back into their @entity133 tie the bottom line is , several of those players are well past their best			1
going back two years , sir @entity46 had to bring @entity137 , who was a coach at the club , back from retirement as he was short of a holding midfield player who could supply passes and control the tempo of the game			2
surely the alarm bells must 've been ringing loud and clear when @entity137 was in his late 30s and put back into the first team			2
strikers : @entity113 ca n't be happy with the way the @entity93 has been so outspoken @entity148 has a dilemma			1
who does he pick as his ' big man ' option as we get closer to the wonderful @entity20 in @entity154 ? @entity17 has been consistent , he 's been steady and at times he has added the spectacular			1
this is a man who has ploughed and furrowed his way through lower leagues , through non-leagues , and finally made his mark as a top quality target man in the @entity162			2
i remember him well from just a few years ago , scoring for @entity164 against my team at the time and basically putting another nail in my managerial coffin with that club			2
in the goals : @entity17 has scored twice for @entity21 when they have played him he was quality that day , he oozed confidence			1
he is an excellent technical finisher and as an @entity21 fan i think @entity17 will get the nod over @entity18			1
@entity18 undoubtedly has great qualities and mr @entity148 would have to consider which player to choose if he were to have an impact substitute			1
this is where @entity18 could sneak in			1
if you 're 1 - 0 down with 20 minutes to go , i think @entity18 could have a far greater impact			1
when defenders are tiring at the end of a match in hot conditions the last thing they want is a battering ram hurled at them			0
@entity148 's got a big decision to make			1
up high : @entity18 is less subtle in his play but brings a more physical threat sunday afternoon brought back , as it does every year , tears of sadness as i sat watching the teams coming out at @entity198 for the @entity200 final			1
i could only shake my head remembering the 1986 @entity200 – it was called the @entity202 back then – when i played for @entity25 against @entity203			1
we were near the top of the @entity207 , they were near the bottom			0
we 'd beaten them away about three weeks before the final			2
reminiscing : watching the @entity200 final brought back memories of 1986 when @entity203 beat @entity25 and in the semi-final we had beaten treble winners @entity83 over two legs , including a 2 - 2 draw away at @entity216 where thankfully @entity217 scored two own goals and we did n't even have one shot			1
we were odds - on favourites			0
we had the celebrations organised for a hotel in @entity224 after the game			0
it was a question of just turning up			0
we might as well not have done			0
i think it 's fair to say i was one of @entity203 's best players ; repeatedly giving the ball away , not making any tackles , and the whole game just drifted by			0
i found myself substituted after 70 minutes and i 'll never forget sitting on that bench feeling empty , knowing i had blown it and let the supporters and my family down			0
they hammered us 3 - 0 and that experience will never leave me			2
trophy : @entity240 beat @entity241 3 - 1 to claim their first silverware under @entity243 i was fortunate to be invited the @entity244 on thursday night for the annual @entity246 fund - raising and awards dinner			0
they are a charity who fund medical research for children – it is a brilliant cause			0
on the night a huge £ 70,000 was raised , which is a fine effort			0
there was a big charity auction with golf trips and holidays to @entity257 on offer and some prizes going for big sums to some very wealthy people			0
it was nice to do something away from football			0
there was a man from @entity267 called @entity268 , who played the piano , sang and joked around and had everybody in fits of laughter			0
he 's the funniest entertainer i have ever seen			0
it was a wonderful evening .			0

the first time i saw @entity14 he left his mark with an overhead kick
arrogant @entity15 should leave @entity16
i think @entity17 will get the call over @entity18 from @entity148
watching the @entity200 final brought back memories of 1986
