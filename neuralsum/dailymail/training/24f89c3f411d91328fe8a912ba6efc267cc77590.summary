former governor @entity0 lifted the curtain on his official portrait monday , revealing a photograph - like giant image of the onetime bodybuilder standing in front of the official @entity8 seal — only something was n't right			1
when @entity0 unveiled the portrait at a ceremony in the state @entity12 in in @entity14 nearly four years after he left office and three years after his split from longtime wife @entity18 , a mysterious splotch could be made out on the left lapel of painted @entity0			1
that splotch is where a small lapel pin portrait of @entity18 once was — just as it was there in real life when he sat for the painting in 2003 — before someone amateurishly scrubbed it off before the unveiling , reports @entity29			1
' it was softball sized , right there on his left lapel			1
' it 's not clear when the pin was haphazardly scrubbed out , but it was revealed just after news broke that @entity18 may have cheated on @entity0 with the governor 's chief political strategist long before @entity0 's lovechild with the maid made his strong - jawed appearance on the national stage			1
the oversized portrait of a youthful @entity0 , which will eventually hang on the third floor , was painted by @entity71 artist @entity70 , a realist who previously illustrated @entity72 and @entity73			2
@entity0 , a movie star before he ran for governor in the chaotic recall election of 2003 , said he owes all his successes in life to @entity8 , which he called a mythical place ' where nothing is impossible			1
' as a boy growing up in @entity71 , he dreamed about the state , he said			0
' i dreamt about @entity8 every day , and i knew that one day i would have to come here to this beautiful state if i wanted to make my dreams a reality , ' he said			2
@entity0 said that while he always dreamed big , he never envisioned his portrait hanging in the state @entity12 , joking ' i might have envisioned a sculpture on @entity88			0
' two of @entity0 's five children attended the unveiling , @entity92 , 16 , and @entity93 , 20 , which also included political notables including at least three former speakers of the @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
he also posed for photos with former staff and lawmakers and hugged 28 - year - old @entity103 , who has down syndrome and worked in the governor 's mailroom			0
lt. gov. @entity107 said the massive image of @entity0 is appropriate because @entity0 is ' larger than life			0
' @entity111 @entity110 ' had a wonderful quote saying , ` you do n't want to be the best of the best			0
you want to be the only one that does what you do , ' ' @entity107 said			0
' and it 's a way to describe @entity0			1
' @entity122 president @entity121 @entity120 , @entity123 , called it ' just right			0
' ' i thought it was very dignified			0
it actually looked like a photograph to me , ' he said			0
revenge ? @entity0 's splotchy lapel was revealed just days after reports emerged that @entity18 may have been unfaithful to the former governor true to his outsized life , @entity0 's portrait is larger than those of other modern - day governors , roughly half a foot wider and a foot taller than his predecessor , according to the @entity140			1
the former governor paid for the portrait himself at an undisclosed cost			0
the portrait unveiling followed an event earlier monday in which @entity0 's @entity146 - based institute hosted a climate symposium that also featured gov. @entity149 , a @entity150			1
the seminar highlighted the state 's aggressive efforts to tackle issues such as reducing carbon emissions			0
' while the politicians in @entity158 ca n't get anything done because of being stuck in these ideological foxholes , we here in @entity8 have two governors from two different parties , together in the same room fighting for the same green energy future , ' @entity0 said at the summit			1
organizers are using the state 's policies to prompt further action ahead of @entity171 climate - change conferences in @entity172 and @entity173			0
during his tenure , @entity0 signed @entity8 's landmark 2006 global - warming law , @entity177 , which paved the way for the state 's system of selling carbon pollution credits aimed at reducing emissions			1
@entity97 praised @entity0 's accomplishment in winning bipartisan support for the climate change law			2
' to get @entity177 through the @entity8 legislature , that is heavy lifting , and i do n't think anyone should underestimate that			0
i 'm not sure any other governor might have done this , ' he said at the symposium			0
@entity0 said that @entity8 leaders of all political stripes have chosen to address climate change because not doing so will cost much more in the long run in things such as state infrastructure at risk of failure because of flooding , increased heat - and pollution - related deaths , and a never - ending wildfire season that stretches state budgets			1
as governor , @entity0 promised to bring fiscal accountability , but the state faced a huge budget deficit when he left office			2
in one of his final acts in office , @entity0 commuted the involuntary - manslaughter sentence of the son of @entity99 , a former political ally			2
months after @entity0 left office , embarrassing revelations emerged about an affair he had with his maid that resulted in a son born out of wedlock			2
the disclosure devastated his marriage to @entity18 , and the two are separated			2
other man ? @entity229 , once @entity0 's top aide , has been named as @entity18 's lover while she was still supposedly happily married to @entity0 governor @entity0 's official @entity8 state portrait unveiled in @entity233 , sept. 8 , 2014 from @entity234 on @entity235 .			1

@entity238 reports that a lapel pin that once portrayed @entity18 was hastily scrubbed out before the @entity8 unveiling monday
the painting shows a soft - ball sized splotch on the left lapel where the pin was reportedly worn when @entity0 sat for the painting in 2003
the painting 's reveal this week comes just days after news broke the @entity18 , like @entity0 , purportedly strayed during their marriage
