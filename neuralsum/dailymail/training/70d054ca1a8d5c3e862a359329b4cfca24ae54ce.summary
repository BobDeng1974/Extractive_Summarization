they both left @entity1 to become one of the @entity4 's leading goalscorers , but that is n't all @entity6 and @entity7 have in common			1
the two strikers also have a tattoo of their name in the @entity12 language created by @entity14 @entity13 in his @entity16 books			1
@entity17 forward @entity6 has revealed that his ink was inspired by @entity7 , after the former @entity20 star saw the films and decided to get a tattoo done			1
@entity6 has two tattoos , one on the inside of each arm , as he shows whilst celebrating a goal the @entity28 striker was inspired to get a tattoo in @entity12 by former @entity30 forward @entity7 ' it ’s written in @entity12 , ' @entity6 told @entity17 's website			1
' that ’s what the guy who did the tattoo said to me			2
he saw it in " @entity16 "			2
' ' i was 18 , i wanted a tattoo but was n’t sure about what			2
he asked me what i wanted but i really did n’t know			0
i wanted something i would never regret			0
' i thought about my mum or dad names of my family initials			0
so i started looking for something but did n’t get it right			0
@entity6 has his son 's name tattooed on the inside of his left arm , and his own name in @entity12 on his right ' so when i found out @entity7 had his name written in @entity12 suggested checking how @entity6 would look			1
i did n’t like that either but then we added @entity59 and i got it done			0
' @entity6 , who has his son 's name tattooed on his other arm , insists that , despite few people understanding the design , he does not regret it eight years on			1
' i am never going to regret it			0
it ’s my own name			0
