by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:16 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 14:11 est , 6 november 2012 most of us stick to warm winter coats , hats and gloves for our @entity8 attire			0
so when police arrived at @entity11 bonfire night wearing protective goggles , many thought it was rather an extreme precaution			0
however , all visitors to this year ’s event in @entity17 – the @entity19 ’s largest and most famous bonfire night – were urged by police to wear such safety goggles to avoid receiving any serious eye injuries			1
@entity23 said that wearing goggles to firework displays is ‘ a standard procedure if attending firework displays			2
forecasters said tonight will be the coldest november 5 for over a decade religious connection : the flame procession in @entity11 has its roots in the 16th century			1
in previous years , 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches step back in time : the shops and buildings on the main streets of @entity11 may have changed , but this is one annual tradition that holds strong showpiece : crowds and marchers gathered around the @entity11 war memorial to light crosses			1
an effigy of @entity79 , who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up @entity81 , is also burnt last year , 170 people were injured and two visitors received eye injuries that left them permanently blinded			0
around 20,000 people travelled by train to @entity11 last night – with many more attending from the town itself			2
torch - lit parades of people in a variety of outfits , many in period costume , walked through streets packed full with the crowds			2
a large effigy of secretary of state for education , @entity100 mp @entity99 , was one of those that were burned			0
several people were arrested for illegal possession of fireworks or other offensive weapons			2
the fiery procession traces its roots to the 16th - century reign of @entity111 and the @entity112			1
it is just one of many november 5 gatherings up and down the country , which illuminated the night sky with colourful pyrotechnics last night			2
while some struck lucky with the weather , others were not so fortunate as their fireworks displays are spoilt by torrential rain			1
temperatures plummeted to below freezing in many areas			0
@entity126 : this marcher seemed to be creating his own trail of thick red smoke as he made his way through the streets of @entity11 burn him ! the effigy of @entity79 is carried through the streets to be set alight spooky : @entity137 may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade the procession , organised annually by six local societies , marks a tumultuous time in @entity146 history			1
a key part of the parade is 17 flaming crosses , one for each of the @entity51 martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 as part of the @entity155			1
the purge was initiated by the @entity157 monarch @entity111 , who reigned between 1553 and 1558 , and passed strict @entity159 legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the @entity162			0
at least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung , drawn and quartered			0
it is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000			1
an effigy of @entity79 , who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the @entity43 with @entity179			0
the @entity11 event has previously courted controversy - in 2001 , an effigy of @entity181 attracted national attention , as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan			2
a fiery history : the seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in @entity11 as part of the @entity194 persecutions against @entity51 in the reign of @entity111 history lesson : the @entity198 celebrations mark , in part , the @entity200 of 1555 - 1557 , a purge of @entity51 religious reformers during the reign of @entity157 monarch @entity204 against the catholic faith was punishable by death , with some burnt at the stake , as in @entity11 , and other hung , drawn and quartered while the flames remained alight in @entity11 , others in the country saw their @entity8 pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain			1
a number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding , with @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 the worst affected			1
it follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend , including one in @entity225 , @entity226 and in the @entity227 , @entity228			0
in all , the @entity229 issued seven flood warnings in @entity146 and @entity231 yesterday morning , covering areas of the @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , the @entity236 and @entity237 were also 53 flood alerts in operation			1
in @entity242 , nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on sunday evening			0
the @entity246 fire and rescue service used a boat as part of their operation at the @entity251			0
@entity252 ! two of the marchers taking part in the annual @entity8 celebrations in @entity11 , the county town of @entity256 , this evening			0
dressed in vivid , blood - red costumes and brandishing burning torches , they are participating in an event which can trace its origins to the @entity262 and the burning of 17 martyrs at the stake in the town in the period 1555 - 1557 video : spectacular ! torchbearers light up @entity11 in anti-papist parade			1

spectacular display as torchbearers light up town with traditional anti-papist parade
thousands line the streets to watch procession in event which traces its roots to the 16th century
one of thousands of fireworks displays and events up and down the country
*disappointment* for some in @entity288 , the @entity289 and @entity231 as torrential rain washes out events
