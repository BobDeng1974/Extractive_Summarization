sexist ? a @entity1 book entitled i can be a @entity3 ( pictured ) sees the famous blonde doll make a number of technical blunders before getting her male friends to fix them all the book , written by author @entity29 and published in july 2013 , opens with @entity1 ' hard at work ' on her laptop , as she explains to her sister skipper : ' i 'm only creating the design ideas			1
i 'll need @entity35 's and @entity37 's help to turn it into a real game ! ' one irate reviewer writes on @entity20 : ' literally six sentences into the story , and already @entity1 can not do it			2
' she immediately admits she does n't know how to actually do computer engineering , and like a @entity46 princess , needs a white knight to rescue her			0
' wheel in the men : @entity1 , while ' hard at work ' on her laptop , explains to her sister @entity52 ( pictured ) , ' i 'm only creating the design ideas			2

pillow fight : the next scene sees @entity1 ( right ) get hit with a ' weird ' virus on her laptop , before borrowing @entity52 's ( left ) computer to finish her work , only to inadvertently infect hers too speed is of the essence : despite taking a computer lesson as school , things do n't start looking up until @entity1 enlists the help of two male friends ( pictured ) who can fix the issue ' faster ' ' it will go faster if @entity37 and i help , ' suggests @entity35 , before he and @entity90 fix the virus and retrieve all of @entity52 's files			1
@entity1 then heads home to ' surprise ' her sister with the good news			0
' you are just too cool @entity1 ! you fixed my computer and saved my homework ! ' @entity52 exclaims			2
reviewer @entity102 points out : ' @entity1 takes 100per cent of the credit for fixing something to which she contributed nothing			0
' she adds : ' i work as a software engineer , which is a male dominated field			0
' it is exactly these stereotypes and portrayals of girls like the one in this book that are the driving force behind the lack of girls wanting to enter these lucrative technology fields			0
' @entity35 saves the day : the book , written by author @entity29 , was published in june 2013 by @entity9 and is aimed at three to seven - year - olds sister act : in one of the final plot - twists , @entity1 seemingly takes all the credit for fixing @entity52 's laptop , despite @entity37 and @entity35 actually doing all the work another reviewer , also a computer engineer , writes : ' as the father of two daughters who are both in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics fields , my only recommendation for this book would be to set it on fire			1
' the only customer to defend the book , wrote : ' all you feminists in uproar over @entity1 asking for her male friends ' help in this book do n't even fit the profile for buying a @entity1 book			1
' it 's called free speech ! not every woman is just as competent as some men in certain areas and vice versa			0
' one female computer programmer by the name of @entity153 , based in @entity154 , @entity155 , set up a comical blog entitled @entity1 , which invites users to re-write pages from the book			1
alternate ending : one computer programmer by the name of @entity153 set up a blog entitled @entity1 , which invites users to re-write pages from the book and includes this submission ( pictured ) poking fun : another user puts their spin on the inflammatory children 's book ( pictured ) ' @entity1 's new book tells girls they need boys to code for them , ' the site 's description reads			2
' @entity177 be the competent , independent , bad - ass engineer that she wants to be			0
' submissions include @entity1 , rather that turning to her male friends for help , suggesting : ' it will go faster if you boys just get out of here and let me work			1
maybe make a @entity189 run ? ' in a statement made to @entity192 today , a @entity1 representative said : ' this book was published in 2010			1
since that time we have reworked our @entity1 books			0
' the portrayal of @entity1 in this specific story does n’t reflect the brand ’s vision for what @entity1 stands for			0
we believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits			0
' we apologize that this book did n’t reflect that belief			0
all @entity1 titles moving forward will be written to inspire girls imaginations and portray an empowered @entity1 character			1

the $ 4 book is aimed at three to seven - year - olds and sees @entity1 as an *incompetent* ' computer engineer '
after a series of technical blunders , the famous blonde character gets her male friends to fix her *problems*
*consumers* argue the plot plays into damaging gender stereotypes
in a statement made to @entity192 , @entity58 apologized and said ' all titles moving forward will be written to portray an empowered character '
