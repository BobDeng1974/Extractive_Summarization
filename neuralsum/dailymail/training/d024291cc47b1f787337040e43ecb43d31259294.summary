the day of @entity1 ’s funeral did not start well for @entity3 ’s @entity2			1
early this morning , outside @entity4 , @entity2 buttonholed a seemingly sweet old lady to ask her why she was lined up behind the barriers			1
perhaps luckily for him she did n’t reply with , ' i ’m queuing for the @entity9 sale up the road and just stopped to see what all the fuss was about			1
as he walked away , job done , she called to him , ' can i ask you a question ? ' he puffed himself up a little , perhaps expecting to be asked for his autograph			1
instead , the not so sweet old lady fixed him with a stern @entity22 glare and said , ' if you were n’t doing the job you do , would you have attended this funeral ? ' ' i was always going to be working today , ' @entity2 replied , stopping just short of saying , ' do n’t you know who i am ? ' ' no , ' she said , ' if you were n’t a journalist sent to cover this funeral - would you have turned up to see it ? ' contrast : @entity51 was interviewing friends of @entity1 on the @entity54 coverage subdued : @entity3 's coverage was on the whole sober and respectful compared to @entity56 @entity57 almost went green			1
' ah , er , well , yes , perhaps , maybe , possibly , ' he stuttered , before tottering away visibly shaken			1
i did n’t see him much after that			2
perhaps , even now , he ’s locked in a portakabin studio putting the finishing touches to a voodoo doll of a sweet old lady and hunting for pins			1
the day did n’t start well for the @entity56 coverage either			2
while @entity3 and the @entity54 were both putting together excellent but restrained early coverage of the day of @entity1 ’s funeral , @entity56 was keeping it classy with the @entity29 - ' who ’s my father : the man i called dad or his best friend ? ' when @entity56 finally decided to join the @entity74 and @entity3 , they did so fronted by those two titans of serious television , @entity15 and @entity14			1
they were joined by three d - list ‘ experts ’ all desperate to tell their story of the day they crossed swords with / once saw at a charity event / made a cup of tea for @entity1			1
all three were awful and boring			2
cringe ? i still have n’t stopped			2
@entity88 : the ceremony at @entity1 's funeral involved hundreds of troops service : the procession of @entity1 's coffin down the nave of @entity4 @entity15 then went on to confirm that he has no future as a commentator for ceremonial state events			2
describing the @entity99 and the @entity100 entering @entity4 , @entity15 put on his best respectful voice and intoned , ' @entity99 and the @entity100 process to their seats			2
' process what to their seats ? did n’t @entity56 have @entity107 at @entity4 ’s for that very purpose ? to commentate professionally ? even @entity15 ’s old buddy , @entity109 , might have done a better job			0
the @entity54 , meanwhile , thankfully left the dumbing down to @entity56			0
after the horrors of last year ’s @entity115 coverage , i was half expecting to see @entity116 , amonsgt the crowd , freshly - minted ' @entity118 - yeah ! ' tattoo on forearm , asking random crowd members , ' what did you think of @entity124 , innit ? ' but no , they made the sensible decision to leave proceedings to @entity51 who , before the funeral started , led an interesting and informed debate on @entity1 ’s legacy , replete with anecdotes from the likes of @entity133 and @entity134			1
alternative presenter ? even @entity109 the @entity136 would have done a better job than @entity15 not up to it ? @entity139 did not do much to boost her own reputation as a serious presenter there was no attempt at offbeat angles or dumb japes			0
and @entity51 ’s gravitas and good judgment was also notable during the procession and funeral			0
for the starkest of contrasts , one only had to watch @entity56 ’s coverage during the reading given by @entity155 , @entity1 ’s granddaughter			0
instead of being inside the cathedral , poor @entity107 was outside interviewing that shameless old grandstander , @entity157 , telling us another story about how great she is			0
@entity160 looked desolate , marooned outside the main event like a correspondent from a regional newspaper from @entity164			0
the @entity54 and @entity3 also dealt well with @entity1 ’s naysayers			0
@entity51 referred to a ‘ confusion of opinion ’ , while @entity3 interviewed several dissenters			0
@entity56 , by this time , however , had moved onto loose women			0
they were back on safe ground .			0

@entity2 came off the loser in a stand - off with a ' sweet old lady '
this morning hosts show why they ca *n't* be *trusted* with the big occasion
