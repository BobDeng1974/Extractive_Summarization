by dr @entity0 i was so pleased that @entity2 , the daughter of @entity3 and the @entity4 , appears to have had what was a fairly dramatic squint corrected			1
with conditions like this , some people have a tendency to make unfair assumptions about someone ’s character based purely on appearance			0
the family have chosen not to reveal the details of ten - year - old @entity2 ’s treatment , and whether she had surgery is not known			1
before and after : lady @entity2 in june 2013 , left , and right , attenidng the @entity18 at @entity19 in december after her correction although there are many options for treating a squint , an operation should n’t be shied away from – it ’s not simply a cosmetic treatment , but one that saves sight			1
ca n’t some people with a squint see just fine ? people can learn to live with varying degrees of vision and sight loss			1
but this condition , if untreated , usually leads to deterioration in the capabilities of the affected eye , which is why treatment at a young age is recommended			2
a squint – the medical term is strabismus – is when the eyes do not align in their movements			2
one eye will look straight ahead , while the other turns inwards , outwards , upwards or downwards			2
as the eyes are focusing on different things , the brain ignores the signals from one eye to avoid ‘ seeing double ’			2
it ’s this eye that becomes weak , and eventually vision in it starts to worsen			2
the problem is often something a child is born with , evident from birth , and it is due to weaknesses in the muscles that surround the eye			1
a child is more at risk of a squint if they are born prematurely , like @entity2 , or have a family history of them			1
saving grace : the squint , also known as a lazy eye , prevented @entity2 , pictured before her operation with her mother @entity72 of @entity73 , from seeing straight is surgery the only sure way of correcting it ? no , it ’s usually offered only once other options have proved ineffective			1
glasses are one of the most common treatments for squints and are used firstly to correct any vision problem			2
but this can also correct the squint itself			2
injections of @entity88 have now started to be used on the @entity89 for squints : this is injected into the eye muscles and allows them to realign			0
the younger the child , the higher the chances are of correction and preserving optimal vision			0
what about eye patches – are they helpful ? patching is used for children with squints but is not a treatment			0
it can save the child ’s vision , but does n’t affect the cosmetic appearance			1
when a child has a squint , one eye becomes ‘ lazy ’ and loses vision – we call this amblyopia			1
this weaker eye points in the wrong direction and so does n’t get all the visual stimuli the other one does			0
an eye needs these stimuli to develop proper visual pathways to the brain			0
a lazy eye will therefore not have proper development and the child relies more and more on the good eye			1
patching is used to cover the good eye , which forces reliance on the weaker eye , and so it can start to develop proper visual pathways			0
the earlier this is done the better – often from age two			0
if left untreated beyond the age of seven , it is usually too late to acquire full vision in the lazy eye			1
what does the operation involve ? eye movements are controlled by a set of muscles , and corrective surgery moves these muscles to a new position to straighten the eyes			0
there is no scar – just a few dissolvable stitches are left inside the eye socket			0
it can be sore for a few days but recovery involves using the eyes as soon as the patient feels comfortable – to read , for example – so that they get used to working again			0
is surgery always successful ? squint surgery is relatively straightforward , but a second operation for further alignment of the eyes is not uncommon			0
estimates show that about one in five goes on to have a second operation			0
is there a cut - off point – can adults have squints corrected if they did n’t as children ? the operation is possible with a good chance of an acceptable cosmetic result , but it would be too late to correct a ‘ lazy ’ eye for visual acuity			1
as a rule , the earlier someone is treated , the better the outcome			0
concerns about a child ’s eyes should be a raised with a gp who can refer to an orthoptist for assessment of the eye muscles .			1

lady @entity2 , aged ten , has had an eye problem corrected
correcting a squint - known as a lazy eye - can save a child *'s* sight
