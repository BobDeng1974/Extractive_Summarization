by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 9 august 2013 residents in @entity2 are going to extreme lengths every summer to try to protect an ancient glacier in @entity5			1
protective blankets have been laid over the undulating mounds and folds of part of the ice in an effort to ebb the annual melt as average temperatures gradually climb			0
the @entity14 , the source of the @entity16 in the centre of the @entity18 , has retreated dramatically over the past 150 years , according to research			1
optical illusion : from afar it looks as if nothing has changed , but look a little closer and ti becomes clear this glacier has been coated in a hundreds of white blankets			1
researchers go to great lengths every summer to cover the ice in an effort to slow the melting process caused by global warming the innovative method of trying to minimise the ice - melt has also been designed to allow visitors to witness the incredible ancient ice from an entirely unique perspective , for as long as possible			1
the landowners have carved a tunnel inside the glacier , large enough to walk through , allowing people to almost step back in time into a world which has not been exposed for many thousands of years			1
samples of ice had previously pre-dated the glacier to at least the 17th century			0
but new technological advances , coupled with access to recently - exposed rock , have now allowed them to date the ancient structure to at least 11,500 years old			1
the annual covering of this section of the glacier is an attempt by the family who own the land to preserve their ice tunnel which brings in an income			0
unique : scientists have also carved a long tunnel into the ice for their own research purposes , and giving visitors a completely unique insight into an ancient world under the glacier as recent ice melts have exposed rocks and soil for the first time in thousands of years , they have revealed interesting clues from remnants of organic material and artifacts of human settlements			2
a team of scientists from @entity79 have found that the @entity5 ' great glacier has also been shrinking and growing over time , in response to changes in the climate			2
using isotope measurements from rock newly exposed by the melting glacier , the scientists found that for most of the @entity88 period , dating from the end of the last @entity90 about , 11,500 years ago , the @entity16 was in fact smaller than it is today			1
using this dating technique , the researchers believe they may be able to apply their model to other glaciers worldwide and use the data to piece together a global picture of the @entity88 period			0
eerie : stepping into the glacial tunnel truly is like stepping back in time , walking through a passage of ice that has been hidden from view for thousands of years the data could also be used to predict the rate at which , given current trends in climate change , these giant formations will recede over time			2
the scientists also warn that the revelation that the @entity14 was once smaller than it is today , could be used as an example by climate change - skeptics , that there is no harm in things changing			2
however , quoted in an article published by @entity119 's @entity118 , @entity120 , a geochemist and @entity123 associate research professor , said this is ' simply wrong '			0
he said the findings show that even though the climate shifts were relatively mild during the @entity88 period , ' we find that the glaciers really reacted strongly â€¦ telling us they are very , very sensitive to even very small ( changes )			0
' with the addition of man - made warming , the glaciers will react catastrophically to what we are doing to the climate			0
' the @entity14 in @entity2 has been retreating for 150 years , but new research shows that it was smaller than it is toady 11,500 years ago			1
scientists warn however that these fluctuations were without man 's influence showing how sensitive glaciers are to small climate changes			0

every summer researchers cover the @entity14 in the @entity18 in giant white blankets to try to minimise melting
*experts* say the glacier has retreated dramatically over the last 150 years and want to prevent it from receding more
dating newly exposed rock has shown the glacier is at least 11,500 years old and is very sensitive to climate changes
