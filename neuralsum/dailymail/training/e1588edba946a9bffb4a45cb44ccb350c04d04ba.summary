by @entity0 published : 13:14 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 13:15 est , 24 january 2014 as remarkable as 3d printing is , most objects created using the technique have , up until now , been limited to rigid structures			1
but this could be about to change with a new generation of materials that are allowing designers to create morphing 3d designs			2
@entity11 from @entity12 has become one of the first to make use of multi-material 3d printing by creating inflatable rubber - like flowers			1
it allows , for instance a working product to be created with different properties without the need to bring together separate components			0
experts claim it increases speed to market by allowing organisations to prototype increasingly complex parts			0
it also reduces waste products by using exactly the right amount of material required			0
the flowers , created as part of the ‘ seamless blossom project ’ , open up as air is pumped into inner chambers , revealing a colourful inner core			1
mr @entity11 claims they are the first ever inflatable objects to be created with 3d printing			1
‘ basically , it ’s a curved hollow chamber with flexible rubber			2
as you inflate it , it creates a gap of air that pushes against the inner layer , forcing the outer layers open			2
it almost blooms , like a flower , ’ he said			0
recent advances in 3d printing now allow the simultaneous layering of different build materials in a single print a screenshot from the computer aided design ( @entity64 ) programme @entity11 used to create the flowers the flowers were created using @entity69 ’s multi-material printer which is able to simultaneously print a mix of both a flexible and rigid material at point of print			1
mr @entity11 has designed his project as an interactive installation without any electronics , sensors or computer control , working only on air pressure			1
it is the first in what experts are predicting could be a wave of @entity84 printed objects that use different materials to morph shape			0
last year , for instance , @entity90 architect @entity88 announced a project to develop morphing materials in collaboration with @entity96 - based group @entity95			0
mr @entity11 has designed his project as an interactive installation without any electronics , sensors or computer control , working only on air pressure the flowers , created as part of the ' seamless blossom project ' open up as air is pumped into inner chambers , revealing a colourful inner core mr @entity108 has now set up a radical lab at the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) to create materials that self - assemble			1
like mr @entity11 , the @entity110 lab plans to use of multi-material 3d printing to programme different properties into various parts of a product ’s geometry			2
the idea is that these parts will have varying water - absorbing characteristics that activate a change in shape when they come into contact with moisture			0
the technique could lead to structures such as self - assembling furniture , or water pipes that know when to expand and contract			0
