by @entity0 a flash of iridescent colour when a dragonfly darts over a pond is an evocative image of summer			0
and it is one that is being witnessed more and more often , new data reveals			0
dragonflies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to conservation work and warmer weather			1
a project that tracked different species over five years has led to a comprehensive @entity15 in @entity16 and @entity17 , published today			1
voracious spread : from its landing spot in @entity21 , the small red - eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country , spreading to the @entity24 in the south , @entity26 in the west and @entity28 in the north it found seven new species have been sighted in @entity32 in the past 20 years after migrating from the continent			1
six had not been seen here before and one re-established itself after a six - decade absence			0
some , including the small red - eyed damselfly which was first sighted in @entity32 in 1999 , have since spread voraciously across @entity16			1
from its landing spot in @entity21 , the small red - eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country , spreading to the @entity24 in the south , @entity26 in the west and @entity28 in the north			0
the dainty damselfly , absent in @entity16 for 57 years , made a surprising reappearance in @entity43 in 2010 and has now established a colony on the @entity45			1
the atlas combines pre-existing conservation data with new information collected by 6,600 @entity50 volunteers between 2008 and 2012			2
the results established that 14 of the 42 established @entity53 breeding species have expanded their ranges			2
welcome back : the dainty damselfly , absent in @entity16 for 57 years , reappeared in @entity43 in 2010 and has established a colony on the @entity45 conservationists think that dragonflies , which are extremely sensitive to temperature change , have benefited from a warming climate and a general increase in the number and quality of wetlands			1
@entity15 editor @entity64 , of the @entity50 , said : ‘ dragonflies are a very good indicator of the quality of environment			2
‘ they need good , clean water to survive , so typically the more dragonflies , the better the quality of the water			2
‘ but more significant is the impact of changing climate			2
we think new species are coming here because it is gradually getting warmer , and dragonflies are very sensitive to that			1
’ dr @entity80 of the @entity81 , which helped contributed to the atlas , added : ‘ this represents inspiring contributions from many , many volunteers across @entity16 and @entity17			1
‘ dragonflies are charismatic and popular insects but they also provide an important insight into the ways in which our environment is changing			0
‘ not only is the atlas another wonderful example of citizen science but it is also providing valuable scientific evidence			0
’ dragonflies , which have existed on @entity96 for 325million years , have been threatened by widespread insecticide use , water pollution and the draining of wetlands for housing			0
the research found that eight species , including the scarce blue - tailed damselfly and white - faced damselfly , have declined in recent years			0
but overall the trend seems to have been reversed , with warm summers , conservation efforts and cleaner water providing better conditions for the ancient insects .			0

atlas of the @entity95 in @entity16 and @entity17 is published today
it shows seven new species have migrated to @entity32 from the continent
conservationists think dragonflies have been helped by warmer climate
