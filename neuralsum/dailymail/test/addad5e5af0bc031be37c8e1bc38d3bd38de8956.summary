the @entity0 have admitted they are on course to lose at least 20 mps , but claim this could still be enough to put them back in power			1
@entity6 today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains , stopping off in @entity12 where the @entity0 held @entity13 after @entity14 was jailed			1
but behind the scenes , senior party sources admit their current total of 57 mps will be slashed to ' in the thirties ' after a catastrophic collapse in support			1
@entity6 today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains , stopping off in @entity13 in @entity12 mr @entity6 today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of @entity28 seats			1
instead of battling to win seats across the country , the party has highly targeted strategy , effectively fighting 60 by - elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance			1
a party source said if the party had a group of mps numbering ' in the 30s ' it could potentially hold the balance of power after may 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government			1
the senior @entity0 , closely involved in the party 's election strategy , said the campaign 's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off			1
assessing the election outcome , the source said : ' everything is so marginal , we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is			2
' there are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the @entity0 in it			2
' asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic , the source said : ' oh yes			0
' pressed on whether that was a ' best case ' scenario , the senior @entity0 said : ' i would like to say 150 , but i think in fairness you would n't believe me			0
' there are lots of marginal seats			1
there 's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40 - odd			1
' mr @entity6 today admitted that his party was fighting ' tooth and nail ' in fewer than a tenth of @entity28 seats opinion polls by @entity88 since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the @entity0 support , to barely 8 per cent the @entity0 won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the conservatives			1
mr @entity6 travelled to @entity13 , the scene of a 2013 by - election triumph , to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats			1
the @entity0 have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by - election contests , including in the @entity12 seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister @entity14 , despite a @entity110 surge			0
mr @entity6 and the party 's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings , which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark , are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling			1
the @entity0 leader told supporters : ' what we are going to do on may 7 is n't just , as the placards say , win here , we are going to win up and down the country			0
' because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one @entity13 by - election but 60 @entity13 by - elections - north , south , east , west , campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory			0
' he added : ' in the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on @entity137 , on @entity138 and on social media			0
' so we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before			1
sixty by - elections up and down the country			0
' mr @entity6 was all smiles at the @entity146 cricket ground near @entity13 , behind the scenes , senior party sources admit their current total of 57 mps will be slashed to ' in the thirties ' after a catastrophic collapse in support			1
the alternatives to a coalition involving the @entity0 were a @entity158 - @entity157 alliance ' saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation ' or a ' hapless @entity164 administration dancing to the tune of @entity110 , the @entity166 and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own mps on the right wing of the @entity170 '			0
in a rallying cry delivered at @entity173 's @entity146 stadium he said : ' if you do n't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right , lurching to the left , the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote @entity0			0
' we will cut less than the @entity182 , we will borrow less than @entity158			0
we have provided a heart to a government with the @entity182 , just as we would provide a brain to a government with the @entity158 on the economy			0
' he added : ' we will win again			0
we will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again			1
we will serve our local community better than any other party does again			2
we will speak to more voters than any other party again			2
' asked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for ' 60 @entity196 ' , mr @entity6 said : ' i am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by - election is what we are applying in the 60 - odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get @entity0 elected in this election			1
' a new survey by @entity207 had the @entity208 on 36 per cent , with @entity158 trailing on 30 per cent , @entity110 on 11 per cent and the @entity0 on 9 per cent the @entity208 could be six points ahead of @entity158 , or three points behind , depending on which opinion poll to believe			2
the latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing : the result is probably too close to call			0
@entity164 's day will have been brightened by a six - point lead in a survey by @entity207			0
the @entity208 are on 36 per cent , with @entity158 trailing on 30 per cent , @entity110 on 11 per cent and the @entity0 on 9 per cent			2
another poll by @entity219 for the @entity220 also gave mr @entity164 's party a lead , but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for @entity158			2
however , the @entity225 's @entity88 poll had @entity158 in the lead on 34 per cent to the @entity208 ' 33 per cent , indicating that the battle for no 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders			2
@entity158 enjoyed a three - point lead in a @entity231 poll , on 36 per cent ( up one point ) to the @entity182 ' 33 per cent ( up one )			0
north of the border , a @entity234 poll found @entity157 support continuing to surge to 54 per cent , almost two - and - a - half times @entity158 's 22 per cent .			0

party on course to lose a third of the 57 seats it won in 2010 , sources say
@entity6 admits party is fighting ' tooth and nail ' in a tenth of constituencies
aides think that even 30 seats could be enough to hold balance of power
