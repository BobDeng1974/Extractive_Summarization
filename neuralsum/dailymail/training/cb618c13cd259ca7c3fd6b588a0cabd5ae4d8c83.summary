the @entity0 has done it , as has the airforce			1
and now the @entity3 has arrived in @entity4 to show off the weapons it hopes it never has to use at the @entity6			1
@entity7 - the largest in the @entity3 - slipped up the @entity8 on friday , past the tidal barriers , and up towards @entity10 to check out the berth , where it will monitor and protect @entity4 during the @entity6 this summer			1
the hardest part of the journey was slipping past the @entity8 barrier , which at only 60m gave some clearance on each side - but not much in terms of margin for error			1
@entity40 told the @entity44 : ' the decision to engage would be made at the highest levels of government			1
' asked if he was personally willing to give the order to destroy a rogue aircraft , he said : ' of course ... i ’m certainly prepared to make decisions			1
' mr @entity40 added that @entity53 and visitors ' should be reassured by the military presence - there is no risk from the equipment			1
it ’s defensive in nature and pointing skywards			1
' the amphibious assault ship is being positioned in @entity10 to provide extra security for the @entity6 @entity7 was commissioned in september 1998 at her home port @entity65 , @entity66 , after being built by @entity67 on the @entity68 and fitted out by @entity69 at @entity70			1
she is the sole member of her class in the @entity3 , designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of commander @entity76 and commander @entity23 @entity78			1
the ship carries a crew of 255 , an aircrew of 206 and 480 @entity83			1

its weapon systems include four @entity117 / @entity116 twin 30mm guns together with three @entity120 / @entity119 close - in weapon systems			2
questioned how he would deal with a hijacked airliner full of passengers , he said : ' we rehearse these things , we train for them			1
' all the ministers involved are fully versed in the processes they have to go through , the judgments they have to make			2
' i ’m not going to spell out precisely who is in the loop and who is not , but there are a number of ministers who are involved in the air defence arrangements			2
the decision to engage would be made at the highest levels of government			2
' mr @entity40 , who was taken on board @entity141 by a landing craft , said of the security arrangements : ' i do n’t think it ’s over the top			1
every @entity37 in recent times has had a significant military component to its security plan			1
' arrangements for security has been ongoing for the last few days , with @entity7 now making its debut appearance			1
the ship will remain in @entity10 throughout the summer games			2
the warship , which has the motto ' boldly faithfully happily ' , will have quite an army on board - 300 military personnel will base themselves on the ship , while eight @entity105 helicopters with sniper teams onboard will be ready to lift off at a moment 's notice			2
it is part of huge military protection for the city , with @entity168 jets stationed at @entity169 , and ground - to - air @entity171 missiles dotted on rooftops at six sites across the city			0
defence secretary @entity40 said : ' whilst there is no specific threat to the @entity37 , we have to be ready to assist in delivering a safe and secure olympics for all to enjoy			1
' @entity171 surface - to - air missiles have also been showcased at @entity181 , in south east @entity4 , as part of the massive 2012 security test on land , sea and in the air			1
@entity187 and @entity188 in @entity189 will play host to the sailing where the @entity193 - class amphibious assault warship @entity194 will play a key role in protecting the events			0
colonel @entity197 , commander of the @entity198 , said : ' we have done as much as we can to allay people 's fears			0
' the @entity171 system has a world - class radar on it and is particularly good at picking up low and slow - moving objects in the sky			0
it means we 're able to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of @entity4			0
' @entity212 @entity211 added : ' we want the focus to be on @entity214 this summer and not us			0
we 're very proud to be part of this plan to deliver a safe and secure @entity6			0
' the @entity217 in @entity218 and the @entity219 in @entity220 , both in east @entity4 , have been identified as potential sites for the @entity222			0
members of the public watch as the @entity7 passes @entity225 @entity171 missiles would be positioned on @entity227 and in @entity228 , both in south east @entity4 , and at @entity229 in @entity230 and @entity231 at @entity232 in @entity233 , both in north @entity4 , should the @entity234 be approved by the government			1
col @entity197 said the sites had been chosen to avoid having weapons inside the @entity238			0
he said : ' we 're trying to de-militarise this and let the sport do the talking			0
the @entity217 is the best available location away from the @entity238			0
' heading to @entity244 : the @entity7 earlier today , out at sea , making its way to the @entity8 ready and waiting : the @entity168 jets line up on the tarmac at @entity169 , west @entity4 , ahead of a nine - day military exercise to test security for the @entity37 what the ... ? a man walks past a @entity171 short range air defence system at @entity227 , @entity4 , ahead of the exercises we got your back : surface - to - air missiles at the army cadet base in @entity227 , southeast @entity4 the @entity171 surface - to - air missile has the power to take down a @entity262 747 full of passengers if needed to protect a stadium full of 80,000 @entity37 spectators in a terrorism nightmare scenario			1
the @entity23 military has insisted that the missiles - with a range of up to five miles - could be deployed as the last line of defence			0
experts say the likelihood that they will be fired is slim to none			0
@entity276 an aircraft would still cause debris to rain from the sky , high casualties and fires			0
ready to roll : @entity83 commandos in rigid inflatables , from the @entity3 flagship @entity194 , take part in a security exercise off @entity187 and @entity188 when you launch a @entity171 missile and shoot down an aircraft , it 's not like the whole thing vanishes			1
it 's 100 tons of metal , scraps , and other stuff that is coming down , ' said @entity295 , a retired @entity296 captain who is director of the @entity298 - based @entity297			0
' if a @entity171 is used , the damage could be just about the same as the intentions of the terrorist - only on another spot			0
the goal of the terrorists will be met in a certain sense , ' @entity295 said			0
it 's rare for the @entity23 military to publicise the location of its weapons , but the military says it hopes that any potential attacks will be deterred by showing the missile strength and other defense assets such as @entity168 fighter jets			0
ground - to - air missiles have been a fixture of olympic games and large vip events in the post- 9/11 world , but @entity4 's missiles have sparked outrage among residents of an apartment block who learned that the @entity171 might be stationed on their roof			0
they say the missiles are creating a climate of fear - which security experts say is exactly the point			1
that 's because the systems are more valuable as deterrents than as deployed weapons , mr @entity295 said			0
' the @entity23 army and air force do n't do all this to really shoot down a terrorist aircraft , they do it to display their determination to do so , which will hopefully prevent the terrorists from attacking , ' mr @entity295 said			0
' if you know that there are 500 policeman outside the jewellery store , you will not go there and try to rob the store			0
' the @entity350 it has not decided where it will ultimately station the missile batteries .			0
