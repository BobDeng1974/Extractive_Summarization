his seventh assist of a season that could finish with him crowned @entity59 player of the year was a beauty			2
to his credit he ignored the chants of @entity8 ’s supporters in a corner of the shed when he casually walked over to take a corner at the start of the second half			1
they were at their most provocative , with many pointing at him and chanting obscenities as he went to retrieve the ball behind the byline			0
