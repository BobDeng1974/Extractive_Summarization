one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than £ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed			1
emergency funding by the government after last year 's floods helped drive a 33 % increase in pothole repairs , but there has been no reduction in the amount needed to bring the network in @entity14 and @entity15 up to scratch , said a report			1
the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) said £ 12.16billion was needed to get the local road network back into ' reasonable ' condition , adding that money spent on filling 2.7 million potholes in the past year had been ' wasted '			1
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , said the report			1
one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than £ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed the annual survey also found a ' dramatic ' increase in the amount paid in compensation to motorists in @entity14 , doubling to more than £ 20 million outside @entity34			1
the staffing costs to local authorities for processing claims increased to almost £ 18 million , equivalent to 225 hours per month per authority , it was found			0
@entity40 , chairman of the @entity18 , said : ' the government 's emergency funding for pothole and flood repair following last year 's wet winter has clearly contributed to the trends reported in this year 's survey			0
' essentially , the money spent on filling the 2.7 million potholes reported is wasted - it is inefficient and short term in its effectiveness			1
' so , while we understand that the @entity54 is promoting permanent repairs , the point remains that money would be better spent preventing potholes forming in the first place			1
' the £ 6 billion of funding pledged between 2015 and 2021 is welcome , and hopefully will be confirmed by an incoming government			0
but the truth is that although it sounds like a big investment , it will only be enough for local authorities to tread water and it will do nothing to tackle the backlog or prevent continuing deterioration			0
' @entity67 , transport spokesman at the @entity68 , said : ' councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts			2
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , a new report claims ' it is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that , despite our best efforts , we have not been able to make a dent in the £ 12 billion roads repair backlog			1
patching up our crumbling road network is simply not the answer to tackle the roads crisis we face as a country			0
' councils need billions , not millions , to bring our roads up to scratch			2
every mile of motorways and trunk roads will receive £ 1.4 million funding over the next six years compared with £ 31,000 per mile for local roads			2
this makes little sense given the government 's own traffic projections predict an increase in local traffic of more than 40 % by 2040			0
' professor @entity101 , director of the @entity102 , said : ' back in 2010 the top transport priority amongst voters was filling in the potholes			2
five years later and an @entity102 poll shows fixing our roads and pavements remains the public 's number one concern			0
' the extra chunks of cash spent on road maintenance over the last parliament have been welcome but with a record number of cars on the road , rising traffic volume and routine resurfacing work taking place only half as frequently as in the 1980s , this issue is unlikely to slip far down the list of things people want ministers to tackle			0

one in six roads are still in poor shape even after millions of potholes fixed
@entity17 says money spent filling in *2.7million* was wasted
a report says that clearing the backlog of repairs could take up to 13 years
