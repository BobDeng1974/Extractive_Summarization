by @entity0 if the @entity2 players are in any doubt about what their new boss @entity4 requires from them , a coaching manual he wrote in @entity8 but never translated into @entity9 is a good place to start			1
modestly entitled ‘ @entity11 ’ ( vision ) , the great man outlines his philosophy in words that would be clear to even the biggest football simpleton			1
‘ my training is based on an attacking style of football			1
never defensive ! ’ is the emphatic message , complete with self - penned exclamation mark			2
the full - on lesson continues : ‘ to destruct the organisation of the opposition my team must pass the ball around at the highest possible speed with a terrific use of all positions			2
when we lose the ball i do n’t want my team to run backwards , i want them to win it back in the quickest possible time			2
‘ i deliberately call my training models technical / tactical , because in my sessions one is linked to the other , ’ he wrote			2
‘ i will be right on top of every player , demanding each player will give the maximum in each passing session			0
’ as @entity2 ’s stars lap up the rays in @entity52 ahead of their first match of the @entity40 era against @entity75 on wednesday , the 62 - year - old ’s vision is both a motivation and a warning			1
for all his incredible achievements with @entity79 , @entity58 , @entity80 and the @entity82 national team , @entity40 has never coached a @entity84 player before and he is intrigued as much as anyone else by whether @entity84 players can cope with his demands			1
stay happy : @entity40 has been upset in the past when he feels he failed as manager at @entity79 and @entity8 @entity40 does not want to turn @entity90 into ‘ @entity91 ’ but such are the potential tactical deficiencies among the @entity9 players he is inheriting a couple of reinforcements are needed , particularly with @entity96 sidelined for three months with ankle - ligament damage sustained in training on thursday			1
@entity82 @entity100 star @entity99 is his first priority			1
the 24 - year - old @entity79 player showed in @entity103 , where he helped @entity40 ’s @entity8 reach the semi-final , that he is infinitely better at adapting to different positions than @entity43 , @entity106 , @entity107 or @entity108 , for example			1
executive vice-chairman @entity110 will be politely asked to secure the signature of @entity112 in the face of growing interest from @entity58			0
he can play left - back , wing - back or holding midfield			1
his father @entity118 was one of @entity40 ’s assistants in @entity103			0
and another @entity82 international , @entity120 , will arrive from @entity121 by january at the latest			1
he would already be at @entity90 if not for a knee injury that forced him to miss the @entity100			2
wanted man : left - back @entity99 , who impressed for @entity8 at the @entity100 , is @entity40 's first priority better late than never : @entity121 midfielder @entity120 would already be at @entity90 but for injury @entity40 hopes that three ‘ @entity130 ’ - @entity131 is already in situ - will be enough and that the @entity84 players can adapt to his philosophy			1
some managers such as @entity134 feel @entity9 players are tactically aware if coached properly			0
other foreign bosses became frustrated having to repeat themselves in training			2
those included @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
@entity40 himself spoke of the need for the @entity2 players to ‘ click ’ with his ideas when he made an impressive debut in front of the world ’s media at @entity90 last week			1
and in a separate interview with the club ’s in - house television station @entity150 , he was honest enough to state : ‘ i know all the players and how they have played football under the direction of @entity156 or @entity157 or @entity158			1
but i want to know them personally , and also how they perform to my philosophy			0
’ plans : @entity40 insists his new squad of players must ' click ' with his ideas for the club traditionally , @entity40 ’s sides play with attacking flair , with players expected to interchange positions depending on their opponents			1
he could cover the absence of @entity96 and also fill in for teenager @entity54 when asked , as @entity2 are close to selling their other left - back , @entity173 , to @entity174			1
former @entity176 manager @entity175 , who like @entity40 has also worked in @entity8 and @entity177 , said in a recent interview that he believes it is harder to instruct @entity9 players on tactical issues			2
the current @entity183 boss said : ‘ @entity82 players are very strong technically and tactically			1
it comes about from the way they are brought up by the clubs from an early age			0
‘ at @entity190 , the 11 - year - old youth players would watch first - team games on video and be set homework on a certain tactical aspect			0
it develops a very strong tactical understanding of the game from a very early age			0
everybody in the @entity82 is a coach			2
differences : @entity175 , who has managed in @entity8 and @entity176 , believes it is harder to instruct @entity9 players on tactical issues ‘ both the @entity82 and @entity177 respect the mental strength of @entity9 players and the physicality of the game			1
but there is not a lot of respect for the coaching cultures and systems in @entity176			0
‘ there is a lack of technical and tactical work in how our players are coached from a young age compared to other nations			0
’ with no @entity220 football , @entity218 is also under pressure to sell players to reduce the @entity2 squad to a manageable size			1
@entity225 and @entity226 are n’t on the @entity228 tour while winger @entity229 is a target for @entity231			0
@entity43 is eager to please @entity40 but after being @entity156 ’s favoured son and signing a lucrative new five - year deal last season , he will have to prove himself all over again			0
his past off - the - field antics will almost certainly rule him out of securing his dream of being @entity2 captain			1
as a player , he will have to buy into @entity40 ’s preference for moving the ball quickly , willingness to win the ball back and be a model citizen off the pitch ; standards that saw the coach fall out with @entity248 and @entity249 at @entity250 when they fell below them			0
high standards : @entity40 fell out with @entity248 and @entity249 during his spell as @entity250 manager the last word should go to @entity40			0
in the chapter entitled ‘ @entity257 ’ , he emphasises : ‘ essential in my eyes to improve the players , young and old , is to repeat drills			0
‘ in the beginning they think they are doing the same thing over and over again			0
i will hammer on the way they pass , the way they control and pass again			0
this must be done in an incredibly high tempo			0
’ in the next couple of weeks , @entity2 will limber up for the new season with matches in @entity47 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , and possibly @entity276			2
a couple of them sound like great holiday places , but make no mistake , it ’ll be hard work proving themselves to their @entity82 master			2
it ’s all about the vision .			0
