by @entity0 under new coach @entity2 , @entity1 keep winning — so long may that continue			1
it has to be said that , for a second week running , there was a good bit of luck required			2
but how many times have we been on the wrong end of that equation ? we will gladly take it			2
like in the @entity17 game the week before , the overall performance in the 21 - 19 win against @entity15 was not great — there were lots of errors again — but the spirit in the squad is there for all to see			1
sparkling : @entity1 's lock @entity24 ( c ) holds the @entity25 after a friendly against @entity15 and the good news is that it was a whole new set of players who demonstrated this attitude , as only four remained in the team that beat the @entity32 from the one that started against the @entity17			1
this is the reaction i was expecting from the players			2
everyone will be wanting to impress the new coach and nothing does that more than people who are prepared to dig deep inside themselves for the greater good of the team			0
there does not seem to be any ‘ superstars ’ in the squad doing things for their own betterment — and this will have greatly impressed @entity2			1
he is a @entity49 and they do n’t like players who think they are better than the team			0
you have only to watch @entity53 or @entity54 , two of the best players in the world , and see how hard they work for the team and the amount of self - sacrifice they make to appreciate the @entity63 ethos of playing rugby			2
i think this aligns with how we like our ‘ superstars ’ in @entity1			1
we do n’t like the flash players who take all the headlines off the pitch , as well as on it			0
we admire the grafters , players you hardly notice but are hugely effective on the pitch			0
@entity77 is one of these			0
he has been outstanding for @entity79 all season and he continued that form for @entity1 against @entity15			1
his work rate is phenomenal and he does all the hard work in attack and defence			0
delight : @entity1 's players celebrate their last - minute win against @entity15 it was a big occasion for young @entity24 , who was captaining his country for the first time at the age of 23 , the youngest @entity1 captain since @entity94 in 1996			1
@entity24 did really well , because it is a tough job to captain your country when that young			1
i was made skipper for the tour to @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 in 1993 when i was only 22 , but no caps were awarded on that tour			0
the hardest thing i found was looking around at team meetings and seeing the likes of @entity111 — a @entity113 winner three years earlier and a decade older than me — sitting there listening to me			0
@entity24 would have had a similar experience last week , looking up and seeing players who had been around for years , like @entity120 or recent @entity121 in @entity122 and @entity123 but , on the evidence of what i could see on tv , he coped fine			1
he had some tough calls to make when @entity1 were awarded two kickable penalties with the score at 19 - 10 and 10 minutes to play			1
i would have taken the kick but @entity24 went for the lineout on both occasions , with neither decision resulting in a try being scored			1
on the run : @entity1 centre @entity133 avoids a tackle by @entity15 's @entity136 when @entity1 won a third penalty , he opted for the kick this time , which proved to me that he was still thinking clearly , a crucial factor when captain			1
he also played well , which is of paramount importance when leading a side , and will have loved the experience , especially when the winning kick sailed over from @entity147			0
what a rollercoaster for @entity147 at the end			0
he missed a relatively straightforward conversion with a poor kick and must have thought he had blown @entity1 ’s last chance of victory			2
but he was given another opportunity for glory , with a much harder kick — and he nailed that one beautifully			0
i love @entity147 ’s attitude and temperament			0
he does not allow what has happened before to affect his next job			0
i stated in this column two weeks ago that the goal for this tour would be to arrive in @entity165 undefeated			2
the @entity166 have achieved this goal , albeit not playing brilliantly , but they can now have a crack at one of the best sides in the world with no pressure on them .			2

@entity2 watched on as @entity1 beat @entity15 21 - 19
@entity24 did well in his first game as captain
@entity1 can take on @entity165 with no pressure
