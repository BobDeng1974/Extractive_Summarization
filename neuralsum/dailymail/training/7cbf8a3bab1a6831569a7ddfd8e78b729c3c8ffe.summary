by @entity0 for more than a decade , families with young children have swam in the disused quarry known as the @entity4 , attracted by its tropical - looking water			1
but despite its appearance , the water held a dangerous secret - it is almost as toxic as bleach			0
now , in a bid to prevent people from bathing in the disused quarry at @entity15 , near @entity16 , @entity17 , the council has taken the incredible step of dying it black			2
dangerous : this disused quarry in @entity17 - known as the @entity4 - has been dyed black to prevent people from swimming in it damaging : parents and children have swam in the waters of the @entity4 for more than a decade			1
but the water is almost as toxic as bleach @entity29 : this picture shows how the @entity4 looked before it was turned black the water , which has a ph level of 11.3 , is so dangerous it could cause fungal infection such as thrush , skin complaints and severe stomach problems			1
signs also warn swimmers that the water contains car wrecks , dead animals , excrement and rubbish			1
however , when the weather warms up , swimmers largely ignore the warnings - prompting the drastic action to transform its colour			0
local business owner @entity49 said she thought changing the colour of the quarry water has already made a difference			2
@entity53 : the water also contains car wrecks , dead animals , excrement and rubbish mess : rubbish bottles are pictured surrounding the waters of the @entity4 hazardous : this warning sign was placed near the @entity4 , but some swimmers still decided to take to the dangerous water ms @entity49 said : ' it ’s not pretty any more			1
they do n’t think they ’re on holiday in the @entity67 any more , they know they ’re in @entity15			0
' it was absolutely beautiful to look at but was horrendously dangerous			0
' the incredible blue colouring of the water is caused by the surrounding limestone rocks which leach calcite crystals into the water , turning it turquoise			0
worrying : many signs warn people against entering the water			2
but despite this swimmers often ignore the advice during warmer weather unpleasant : this sign also details some of the nasty health problems which people can pick - up from swimming in the water the alkalinity comes from calcium oxide , a white powder which would have originally been left around the site as a by - product of the quarrying process			1
councils have no powers to prevent trespass because the land is privately owned and the water ca n’t be drained into the water supply because it is so toxic			0
a @entity101 spokeswoman said the pool contained vehicle parts , ' all sorts of rubbish ' and warned that the water temperature was ' extremely cold ' .			0
