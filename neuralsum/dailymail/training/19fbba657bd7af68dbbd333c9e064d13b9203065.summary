former @entity1 party chairman @entity0 claimed there was a mindset in the 1980s to protect the system the @entity6 government may have orchestrated an @entity8 cover - up of child abuse by senior politicians , @entity0 claimed today			1
the former @entity1 party chairman claimed there was a mindset to ‘ protect the system ’ which has been to shown to have gone ‘ spectacularly ’ wrong because incidents of abuse grew			1
the @entity17 has ordered a full - scale legal inquiry into claims of an @entity8 cover - up , after admitting it has lost 114 files including a dossier relating to allegations of abuse			1
@entity25 is to appoint a top lawyer to investigate the government ’s handling of a dossier alleging high - level paedophile activity			1
the file was first passed to home secretary @entity32 by @entity1 mp @entity33 in 1983 – but subsequently lost			1
@entity34 , the @entity17 permanent secretary , said a massive review of 746,000 @entity17 files covering 1979 to 1999 had identified ‘ 573 relevant files which had been retained ’			2
however , he added : ‘ the extensive analysis of the central database identified 114 potentially relevant files had been destroyed , missing or not found			1
' the investigation identified 13 items of alleged child abuse , nine of which were known or reported to the police including four involving @entity17 staff			1
‘ the remaining four , which had not been previously disclosed , have now been passed to the police			2
’ today @entity0 , a minister in @entity6 ’s government from 1979 - 87 , said social attitudes at the time had been wrong			1
he told @entity53 ’s @entity52 : ' at that time i think most people would have thought that the establishment , the system , was to be protected and if a few things had gone wrong here and there that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into it			1
' that view , i think , was wrong then and it is spectacularly shown to be wrong because the abuses have grown			1
' asked if there had been a ‘ big political cover - up ’ 30 years ago , @entity0 replied : ‘ i think there may well have been but it was almost unconscious			2
it was the thing that people did at that time			0
‘ you did n’t talk about those sorts of things			0
it is not the sort of thing that people did			0
not even if i may say so , television journalists , let alone the politicians			0
‘ i think mr @entity25 is right initially to have looked for a distinguished judicial figure to have a look to it , to see what the dimensions of the problem are to report back fairly quickly i hope and then will arise the question of what further sort of inquiries is needed into it			0
’ there is no suggestion @entity0 knew about the cases at the time			2
only last year , a review - carried out for the @entity17 by a @entity95 and @entity96 investigator - concluded the relevant information in the @entity33 file had been passed to the police and the rest of the material destroyed in line with departmental policy at the time			2
the disclosures have intensified calls from @entity108 for mr @entity25 to hold an over-arching inquiry into all the allegations of historic child sex abuse from that period			2
@entity114 mp @entity113 , chairman of the @entity116 home affairs committee , said the loss of 114 files by the @entity17 , relating to historic allegations of child abuse in @entity121 , had been on an ' industrial scale ' and called for a quick resolution			1
he told @entity124 : ' what is a huge surprise is that it is 114 files out of what appears to be 527 , which contained material that was relevant			2
so that ’s a loss of files on an industrial scale and before we jump to conclusions and we rely on innuendo let us follow a process in all this , but let ’s get that process done quickly			1
' a dossier of allegations of abuse was first passed to then - home secretary @entity32 ( left ) by @entity1 mp @entity33 in 1983 , but it has been lost or destroyed @entity114 mp @entity144 said there was a lack of appetite to confront abusers senior politicians and the police are reluctant to tackle allegations of abuse in @entity121 , a senior @entity114 mp has claimed			1
@entity144 , who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former @entity155 mp sir @entity154 , said there was a culture of ' move along , nothing to see here '			1
writing in the @entity160 , he also claimed police officers feared political intereference			2
' among the higher echelons of party politics , where the real power resides , my impression is that there is little appetite to confront the abusers in their midst , ' mr @entity144 said			0
the mood is defensive , the approach is dominated by silence			0
' move along , nothing to see here , ' or ' what 's the point in raking all that up old boy ? ' is the attitude i have seen time after time			0
' he said he was visited by police officers ' to discuss an investigation into a current parliamentarian accused of horrific child abuse '			1
he said the police asked him : ' did i think it was likely that their inquiries would be met by political interference			0
' he went on : ' i looked at them in utter disbelief			0
how can the police put a cabinet minister behind bars for lying about speeding points but be worried they could n't properly investigate someone for child abuse ? ' the incident spoke volumes about the mindset that pervades politics			1
this kind of obstructive , ' look the other way , sweep it under the carpet ' thinking threatens to drag politics to new depths of public hate			0
' the pressure has been growing since @entity114 mp @entity212 - who has carried out his own investigation into child abuse by the former @entity212 mp sir @entity154 - raised the issue of the @entity33 dossier at a @entity218 hearing			1
shadow home secretary @entity219 welcomed the latest review but said that it still did not go far enough			1
' the home secretary does n't seem to have grasped the gravity of this and so officials and @entity226 have not yet taken the action we need , ' she said			1
' given the many different inquiries , @entity229 must establish an overarching review led by child protection experts			0
this would draw together the results from all the different cases , investigations and institutional inquiries to allow us to learn from the failure of previous decades and keep children safe in the future			0
' meanwhile , differences emerged in the government about the need for a @entity246 wide - ranging inquiry into allegations of abuse at the highest levels			1
deputy prime minister @entity250 said that he did not rule out a wider inquiry but he made clear that the ongoing police investigations would have to take precedence			2
' i assume any additional inquiries would n't be able to second guess or even look into the matters which the police are looking into already , ' he told the @entity260 programme			0
education secretary @entity261 disclosed that officials in the @entity263 and the @entity264 had been looking at some of the historic examples of child abuse and at the need to improve child protection			1
' at the moment we are reviewing within the @entity272 exactly what we can do in order to keep children safe now , ' he told @entity260 's the @entity276			0
' i think it is important both that we analyse what has happened in the past when a different culture prevailed , but also it is really important that we ensure that those who are keeping children safe now - teachers and social workers - are supported			2
' @entity286 of the law firm @entity288 which representing some of the victims of alleged child abuse , said it was now ' an absolute necessity ' that there was an independent inquiry into alleged abuse within @entity121			1
' this can not be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault , it will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power , ' she said			0
' to be relevant , and effective , any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard			2
at the moment the allegations are so serious			0
and go so far up in the government , to make many survivors fear for their safety			0
' but cabinet office minister @entity319 insisted it was ' too soon ' to call for an overarching inquiry , though he added that may be the answer longer term			0
appearing on the @entity326 programme , he said : ' we need to be very open about these things so that there ca n't be any hint of a cover - up and i know that is how this will continue to be approached			0
' asked whether there was a need for an overarching inquiry , he replied : ' that could slow things down			0
' the first thing to do on this front is simply to have the inquiry , the investigation that has been launched , that will be done very quickly and then let 's see where that takes us			0
' it may well be the answer then is to have a much broader inquiry but i think it is too soon to come to that conclusion			0
