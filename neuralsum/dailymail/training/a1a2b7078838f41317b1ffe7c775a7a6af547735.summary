by @entity0 the judge at the @entity3 trial has ruled that the double - amputee will be sent for psychiatric evaluation after an expert said that he suffered from an anxiety disorder that gave him ' hyper - vigilance '			1
psychiatrist dr @entity10 , for the defence , said that @entity3 ' condition is linked to his disability and meant that he was prone to fight , rather than take flight , in the presence of perceived danger			1
if @entity3 ' condition is found to have played a role in the fatal shooting of girlfriend @entity18 in his home on february 14 , 2013 , then he may escape a murder charge			2
judge @entity34 said the court would hand down the details of the assessment on tuesday , adding it would be preferable for him to undergo the evaluation as an outpatient			2
the decision on wednesday by @entity34 followed a request for a psychiatric evaluation by the chief prosecutor , @entity44			1
@entity44 questioned why the defense decided to ask dr @entity10 to testify on behalf of the @entity48 runner			0
he has suggested that the trial is not going well for @entity3 and that his lawyers are floating the idea that a disorder contributed to @entity18 's shooting and that therefore @entity3 bears less responsibility for her death			1
@entity3 says he mistook @entity18 for an intruder when he shot her through the closed door of a toilet cubicle			2
prosecutors say he killed her in anger after an argument			0
professor @entity63 , head of psychology at @entity65 , explained to @entity66 more about the condition that it 's claimed @entity3 has			2
' hyper - vigilance is more of a behavioural symptom of wider psychological problems than an actual psychiatric condition in itself , ' he said			0
' hyper - vigilance is when an individual is in a chronic state of high anxiety and arousal and is constantly scanning their surroundings - the environment they are in , as well as friends and the people they encounter - for threats			0
' this is often as the result of suffering a traumatic or frightening experience			0
after a while this state becomes second nature to the fearful individual and begins to shape their routine behaviours - for example always checking behind closed doors when entering a room , or assessing new places for the nearest emergency exit			0
' those who are hyper - vigilant are often easily startled , suffer from poor sleeping patterns , may have difficulty concentrating , and can be quite quarrelsome , spontaneous and irritable			0
' hyper - vigilance is one of the symptoms required in order for psychiatrists to make a diagnosis of @entity107 ( @entity107 ) alongside other symptoms of intense fear such as avoidance , re-experience , flashbacks and intense arousal			0
' not everyone who suffers traumatic events will go on to develop ptsd or hyper - vigilance , and there may be other underlying personality factors or past experiences that make it more likely to manifest in some rather than others , such as narcissism or high intelligence			0
' @entity3 is hugged by a supporter on his arrival for tuesday 's trial cross-examination : prosecutor @entity44 questions psychiatrist @entity127 at the @entity3 trial in asking for another professional evaluation of @entity3 ' mental state , @entity44 appeared to be trying to ward off any attempt by the defense to say @entity3 should be treated favorably by the court because of a mental condition linked to his disability			1
@entity3 ' chief lawyer , @entity136 , said at the start of defense - led testimony that the double amputee 's vulnerability and disability was at the center of his case of a mistaken killing			1
he said @entity3 should not be sent for 30 days of psychiatric evaluation and that he wanted to call another witness to continue testimony			1
the psychiatrist , @entity10 , met @entity3 this month , prompting the prosecutor to question whether the timing of her late entry to the stable of defense witnesses signified a change in tactics by the defense , which has said @entity3 fired out of fear that he was about to be attacked			1

@entity3 ' lawyer claimed he has anxiety disorder linked to his disability
psychiatrist testified that disorder may be linked to the shooting
chief prosecutor asks that @entity3 be placed under psychiatric evaluation
prosecution suggested defence is shifting tactics as trial is *n't* going well
