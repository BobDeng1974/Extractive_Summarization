this stunning set of pictures shows an intense battle between a seal and octopus - in which the seal emerges as the winner by gulping the octopus down in one			1
the hungry seal spots the octopus and decides that it would make a great breakfast , so goes in for the killer move			1
but the little octopus puts up a fight by wriggling about and wrapping its clingy tentacles around the seal 's face			1
these spectacular photos were taken by photographer @entity42 whilst he visited the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			1
the 53 - year - old , from @entity45 , visited the area before sunrise and only intended to picture pelicans diving for smelts			1
however , @entity42 was stunned at around 8am when he saw a lone seal making its way into the @entity55 inlet from the ocean - causing a ' chaotic atmosphere ' among the birds			0
all the pelicans flew off into the distance and @entity42 decided to photograph the seal			0
when the excitement calmed down @entity42 decided to gamble on one more shot of the seal before he set off			0
he said : ' as the activities at the bridge winded down , i walked towards my car to go home			0
then i decided to take a chance and walked west towards the gate			0
tactic : the seal flung the octopus around to kill it as it was proving too difficult to swallow while it was alive and struggling the epic battle played out off @entity44 in @entity45 , as stunned photographer @entity42 looked on the seal caused a huge commotion as it desperately tried to swallow the defiant octopus photographer mr @entity42 explained that the seal eventually had to kill the octopus before gulping it down in one water sight : the seal is finally getting to grips with its slippery prey , which put up a brave fight mr @entity42 said that he felt extremely privileged to witness the ' extraordinary ' aquatic battle , which he said lasted ' quite a while ' ' i was hoping to catch the seal there hunting instead of going out back to the ocean			1
i was not disappointed , as i walked closer to the gate , i could see the seal 's head bobbing up and down near the inlet			1
' i could see that the seal was diving down then surfacing , again and again , as if he was fighting with something			0
' it turned out it was an octopus that the seal just caught			2
' the octopus wrapped himself tightly around the seal 's face : his eight tentacles completely covered the seal 's nose and mouth - i thought i was seeing some kind of sea monster			1
' the epic battle lasted a while as the seal tried desperately to position the octopus to swallow			1
' the octopus , to his credit , fought hard not to be beaten ( and eaten ) , clinging and wrapping his tenacious tentacles with big suckers around the seal			1
i had never witnessed anything like this before			0
' the seal continually dived then surfaced then dived again in an effort to dislodge the octopus			2
he finally succeeded and was able to grab hold of one of the octopus 's tentacles			1
gloating : mr @entity42 said that the seal appeared to go on a victory parade around the inlet after it swallowed the octopus ' as if punishing or toying with the octopus , the seal shook his head vigorously left and right then right and left , flinging the octopus around him liked a frisbee			2
it was a sight to behold			0
' the seal then flipped the octopus high in the air and tried to swallow him			2
but the octopus proved that he was not such an easy prey			0
' the mouth of the seal was filled with the slippery octopus , with all of his eight tentacles spread out			1
' the seal could not swallow the octopus so he spat him out and then started tenderizing his meal again by flinging his lunch back and forth , back and forth			2
' after several attempts , the seal was able to kill the octopus			2
' in the grand finale , the seal triumphantly tossed the now deceased rival in the air , opened his mouth wide , and in one gulf , swallowed the octopus			0
' he then swam around the gate inlet several times as if he was in a victory parade			0
' i was left speechless and very excited to be lucky enough to witness such an extraordinary event			0
