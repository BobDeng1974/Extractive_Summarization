@entity9 , 78 and @entity10 , 75 , were enjoying a quiet night in with the television and a crossword when three men wearing balaclavas burst into their home in @entity16 , @entity17 , just after 6pm on saturday night			1
the masked men rammed pillowcases over their heads before binding their arms and pushing them to the floor			2
horrific injuries : the severe bruising sustained by @entity9 , 78 , after he and his partner @entity10 , 75 , were tied up by masked robbers who burst into their home in @entity16 , @entity17 , on saturday they then ransacked the house - stealing £ 25,000 worth of jewellery and cash during the hour - long ordeal			1
@entity30 mr @entity9 , who suffers from asthma and had only been out of hospital two days after undergoing treatment for a serious chest infection , suffered painful bruising in the attack			1
the great - grandparents have today spoken out in the hope people will come forward with information as detectives continue to hunt for the culprits			0
mrs @entity10 , who used to own a post office in @entity44 before selling up in the early 90s , said : ' i was sitting doing the crossword and @entity9 was eating some ginger snaps with his coffee and watching television when these three thugs with balaclavas and pillowcases in their hands came running in the house			1
i thought it was some kind of joke			0
' they shouted at me to " shut my mouth " and used the most foul language			0
' they yanked the jewellery off my neck			2
i pleaded for them to at least leave my locket that i 've worn for 20 years , but they shouted at me to shut up or they would " kick my head in "			0
' they shoved the pillowcases over our heads and tied my hands and feet , it was really tight and cutting into my wrists			0
' he said they knew we had a safe and wanted to know where it was			0
then they told @entity9 if he did n't get the key to the safe they 'd cut my fingers off			1
' initially we said we did n't have one but @entity9 said " @entity10 , just give them the key "			1
' they then used a crowbar to get access to the safe which had money in from when i sold my post office			0
' the couple were then told to stay in the corridor , as two of the men left to search the property while one stayed behind - threatening to slice off mrs @entity10 's ears if they made a sound			1
mrs @entity10 continued : ' they kept us there for about an hour while they went through the whole house			1
at one point i could hear the sound of a bag being unzipped			0
i thought they were going to put our bodies in it			0
i thought we were going to die			0
' the raiders also ransacked the couple 's bedroom - taking about £ 25,000 worth of jewellery - and a quantity of cash the couple had put aside to buy a new car			1
mr @entity9 , a retired railways worker , added : ' i had to tell them where the safe was , they said they were going to cut her fingers off and i believe they would have done			2
' i feel like moving away from here , but @entity10 loves this bungalow and i 'm not going to let them get the better of me			1
' when the robbers finally fled , mr @entity9 was able to wriggle his hands free and the couple dialled 999			1
the police were on the scene within minutes and used police dogs to try to catch the men 's trail			2
the couple , who met on a cruise after the deaths of their previous spouses , moved into the street 20 years ago , where houses sell for up to three quarters of a million pounds			2
within weeks they had been targeted by thieves , who used glass - cutting equipment to remove a section of a window and sneak in without the couple realising , taking almost all of ms @entity10 's jewellery and family heirlooms			1
they were also broken into at the end of november last year , but were out at the time and believe the alarm caused the thieves to flee empty - handed			2
mrs @entity10 said : ' this is the fifth time we 've been burgled			1
i do n't understand why this keeps on happening to us			0
' it 's horrific what we 've been through , i am totally in shock			0
i do n't swear , but they are absolute scum			0
' what kind of person threatens to cut someone 's ears and fingers off ? i felt like saying to them " would you like someone doing this to your mother ? " ' a spokesman for @entity178 said : ' at 7.40pm on saturday police received a report of a burglary at a home in @entity183			2
' an elderly couple had been tied up and threatened during the burglary when three men forced their way into the couple 's home			1
the couple were checked over by paramedics but did not require hospital treatment			0
' a large amount of cash and jewellery was taken and a police investigation is under way to trace the offenders			2
' acting inspector @entity200 of @entity199 added : ' this was a distressing incident for the occupants and we 're carrying out inquiries to find those responsible			0
