by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it 's the @entity5 @entity4 weekend			1
the sound of the @entity8 engines are rhythmic in my ear as i look across the track and the @entity13 landscape , while my heart is beating at around 140 beats per minute			1
this must be what a @entity18 driver feels like			0
but as news filters in on thursday about a soon - to - be dramatic race weekend , i am made aware of two special features on this course , snow and a neon rave			0
instead , i am taking on an experiment @entity28 and @entity29 took part in earlier that morning			2
two laps around @entity33 's specially designed circuit , with excitement metres and hearbeat sensors connected			1
video : scroll down to see how the @entity8 duo and @entity38 got on on the track changeable conditions : @entity33 's special test track for the ' @entity43 ' experiment ready to go : @entity29 and @entity28 have their excitement levels tested using skin conductance neon rave , or a race track ? the tunnel we would be passing through on our laps @entity38 were invited to this secret test track , just a stone 's throw from the famous circuit , to truly appreciate @entity33 's long - standing partnership with @entity8			1
£ 250,000 toys were provided in the shape of an @entity59 and the @entity60 , but the results of mine and the two former world champion 's experiences in truth could n't be more different			2
an @entity18 driver 's heartbeat rests at around @entity68 ( no wonder @entity29 's so cool ) , while they have to be extraordinarily fit to keep up a rate of around 170 on race day			1
by the end of today mine would have fluctuated between 70 and 150			0
@entity8 test drivers @entity75 and @entity77 would be our pilots today as we look to uncover the @entity80 ' most exciting driving experience '			1
as i step foot into the 458 @entity77 is clearly more used to this than i am			0
' this is really fun , ' he says , grinning from ear to ear			0
are n't these guys used to this ? ' @entity33 always give us great events , but this is something else			1
' he tells me to wait and see			0
fast and furious : we tried out the @entity60 with @entity8 test driver @entity77 contrast : ok , so @entity29 may pull off the @entity8 look better than me ... the thrill is something else			1
while i am soon to be made a fool by @entity29 and @entity28 , the two laps are exhilarating			0
the @entity98 specialist is laughing as he drifts round a corner covered in snow , while my excitement percentage rises as we pass through the tunnel			2
the back - end of the 458 kicks out round sharp corners after using most of that v8 engine , one that is ' technically ' more powerful than those being used in this year 's @entity18 championship			2
watching @entity28 and @entity29 take on their laps later makes me realise just how ' cool ' these drivers are			2
they are paid a huge amount of money , yes , but they risk their lives week - in , week - out for their employers			0
to see them flicker a smile as they are presented with this custom - made track reminds you that this is their playground , their life			2
they 're born to drive			0
me , i 'm just a passenger			0
' thanks to @entity33 , i now know to go looking for tunnels when i ’m not on the track			1
speed : the 458 's tail kicks out as it passes through the snowy section of the track life of a @entity18 driver : these guys really know how to play it cool ... week in , week out as my lap finishes i am told more about @entity33 's partnership , and in particular their fuel technology			1
we are told that a version of @entity145 is ' 99 per cent ' the same as the ' @entity148 ' fuel anyone can pick up today , so much so that we are told a @entity18 car 's performance was n't drastically altered by using ' normal ' fuel			2
time to pretend you 're an @entity18 driver			0
@entity33 have been the power behind the @entity8 at @entity4 's since 1947 , making it one of the most enduring partnerships in the sport			1
that much is clear throughout the race weekend , with @entity28 and @entity29 not shy to praise their contribution			0
it has n't been the best of year 's on the track for the motorsport giant but plans are certainly in place for next season			1
approximately 21,000 hours of testing are put into just the fuel alone , and we are shown certain features in an on - site track lab. despite the season 's form suggesting otherwise , @entity28 is bullish when assessing his chances for the weekend			1
making the most of it : @entity28 said he always believes he can win , no matter what car @entity8 give him ' @entity177 obviously have the advantage , ' he admits			1
' but when i get in that car , i always think i can win			0
' these drivers are n't short of confidence			0
the @entity8 duo were n't overly unhappy with qualifying ( rumours were @entity29 was seen as a push to make it through to @entity188 ) , while their race pace was generally encouraging			1
and hey , despite the two contrasting personalities , there has yet to be a public fall - out between the pair			0
@entity33 found a place to let these spirits free			2
maybe if @entity197 and @entity198 were to race round @entity33 's track , they 'd start to have some fun together too			1
