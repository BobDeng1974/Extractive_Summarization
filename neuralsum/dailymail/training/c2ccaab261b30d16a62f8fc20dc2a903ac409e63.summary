' i 'm just looking at him from right here [ he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches ]			0
he 's got a gun on a shelf right there , the short @entity86 he 's famous for			1
and he 's moving forward			2

thanks for your sixteen years			0
go f * * * yourself			0
' he reveals that , in the aftermath of the may 2011 raid , his marriage with his wife ended yet they have been forced to live together to save money			1
because the @entity158 government have given him nothing - no pension , no health care , no protection for his wife , children or him - he has had to teach them what to do if an attack should be made on their home			1
he told his children in hide in their bathtub , as it is the safest , most fortified place in their house and trained his wife how to use their shotgun , with a ' backup ' knife on the dresser			1
then there is the ' bolt bag ' of clothes , food , and other provisions for the family meant to last them two weeks in hiding			0
the shooter also says that the night before the raid , all the members of @entity27 wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down @entity3			1
he described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death , ' something for them to read when they are 35 '			1

under fire : new film @entity44 , starring @entity43 in the lead role ( pictured ) , has been widely criticized for suggesting that torture played a major part in the hunt for @entity3 last month , it was revealed that gruesome images of @entity3 's body could be made public if a court rules in favor of their release			1
the autopsy and burial photos of the former @entity34 leader have been classified since he was shot dead during the dramatic may 2011 raid on his compound in @entity48 in @entity49			0
a lower court has already upheld the government 's argument that the photos should remain secret in the interest of national security , according to @entity294			1
but a federal appeals court is now considering whether the 52 pictures should be released following a lawsuit filed by the conservative - leaning legal watchdog , @entity299			0
the group says it is not seeking any information about equipment or techniques used in the raid			0
president @entity175 said the photos ' release could provoke violence against @entity158 citizens			2
during an appearance on the ' @entity312 ' show on @entity313 he said it was important to ensure that ' very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool			2
' after @entity3 was killed the @entity175 administration said his body was buried at sea off the @entity326 - in accordance with @entity328 tradition			2
president @entity175 himself said in the @entity330 watching events unfold , ' we got him			0
' before the @entity178 left the compound they destroyed one of the two top secret stealth helicopters that had delivered them to the house after it encountered difficulties on landing and therefore could not take off again			0
intelligence recovered from the home made public in the aftermath of his death showed @entity3 wrapped up from the cold watching news coverage of himself			1
and it was later reported from @entity49 that one of @entity3 's wives told the @entity49 authorities that they had lived there for five years without detection			1
in february 2012 , @entity49 security agencies demolished the building to stop it becoming a shrine to the deceased @entity34 supremo			0
following an outcry from lawmakers over the portrayal of torture in a new thriller called @entity44 and its role in the hunt for @entity3 , a @entity357 panel has launched an investigation to determine whether @entity41 officials intentionally misled the filmmakers			2
the @entity368 will examine records detailing meetings and conversations between intelligence officials , director @entity373 and screenwriter @entity374			0
the goal of the probe is to determine whether the agency gave the filmmakers ' inappropriate ' access to classified material , and whether @entity41 personnel fed @entity373 and @entity374 false information to convince them that harsh interrogation techniques were effective in producing information that led to @entity3			1
since the film hit the big screen in limited release last month , it has drawn high praise and sharp criticism in equal measure , the latter mainly for suggesting that waterboarding and similar techniques were important , if not key , to finding @entity3 .			2
