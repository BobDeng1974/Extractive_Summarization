by @entity0 a pit bull that mauled a four - year - old boy earlier this year will spend the rest of its life in an animal shelter set up in an old jail instead of being put to death - after a man who styles himself as ' @entity12 's toughest sheriff ' stepped in			1
@entity14 judge @entity13 said the dog named @entity16 will be housed in the no - kill shelter opened in 2000 by @entity19 's colorful sheriff @entity18 , an animal lover who offered to take in the four - year - old pit bull			1
@entity21 had declared the dog vicious at a hearing a month ago but declined to have him euthanized after animal - rights advocates came to its defense			0
instead , she ordered @entity16 to be neutered and defanged and gave the @entity28 , a @entity29 - based animal - rights group and the dog 's trustee , 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take him			1
the judge said the dog could not be put up for adoption			0
@entity16 , a pit bull , attacked a four - year - old boy in february and will now spend the rest of his life in an animal shelter set up in an old jail by the sheriff for metropolitan @entity14 @entity19 sheriff @entity18 showed his soft side by taking the pit bull in himself the feb. 20 attack left 4 - year - old @entity46 with a broken eye socket and jaw , and the boy has months , if not years , of reconstructive surgery ahead of him			1
the case touched off a polarizing internet debate on mercy , blame and animal violence , leading to candlelight vigils and riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog 's owners and child 's baby sitter			0
donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for @entity46 since the dog bit the boy in the face			0
animal advocates say both the dog and boy are victims and a baby sitter watching the child was negligent in letting him play near the animal			0
they also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up			0
' i expect to be the sheriff forever ' : @entity18 is confident he 'll be around to look after @entity16 the sheriff , who is known nationally for his immigration enforcement efforts and housing jail inmates in tents , testified that he was confident that @entity16 would be housed at the shelter for the rest of the dog 's life			1
@entity18 also said he did n't get involved in the case to get publicity			2
later in the day , the sheriff will testify at a deposition in a civil rights lawsuit that the @entity97 filed against his office alleging racial profiling , retaliation against critics and other accusations			0
at the dog 's hearing , the question was raised of what would become of the animal if @entity18 is no longer sheriff			1
' i expect to be the sheriff forever , ' the 81 - year - old sheriff quipped			1
the judge pressed @entity18 on what would happen to the animals in his shelter if a future sheriff were to end the shelter program			1
@entity18 answered that any sheriff who would close such a program would n't get re-elected			2
a supporter of the dog , @entity122 , said @entity16 will be able to enjoy more freedoms in @entity18 's shelter than at another county facility where he 's currently being held			1
' today , justice was served for @entity16 , ' she said			2
@entity21 also denied a request from a lawyer representing the dog to rescind her order that @entity16 be defanged			2
attorney @entity131 said it would make more sense to give the $ 2,500 the procedure costs to the injured child 's family			0
@entity131 said the defanging would n't result in the dog losing his canine teeth , but rather they would be cut down and capped to match the height of the other teeth			0
' @entity46 's injuries are so vast and so devastating that $ 2,500 is really just a drop in the bucket , ' @entity21 said , adding that she does n't want the dog to harm another person .			0
