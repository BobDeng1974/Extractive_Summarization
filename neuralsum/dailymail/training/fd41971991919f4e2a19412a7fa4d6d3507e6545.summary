by @entity0 a woman who used to wear size 24 clothes has shed 6st in just 14 months after finding love at her slimming class			0
@entity6 , 43 , weighed 18st 7lb and was plagued with health problems because of her obesity			2
surprisingly , despite being a @entity10 leader she was unable to shift her own extra pounds despite watching others slim down			1
@entity6 weighed 18st 7lb ( left ) before joining @entity10 and dropping down to 12st 7lb ( right ) @entity6 met chef @entity12 at their @entity13 and love soon blossomed between the overweight couple @entity6 became so overweight that everyday tasks , even fitting into the bath , became a chore and she was suffering weight - related health problems but then two years ago she met chef @entity12 , 52 , at her own class in @entity21 , @entity22 and love soon blossomed between the couple			1
and it was that love that finally helped @entity6 lose the weight she needed to			1
since they have been together @entity6 has dropped five dress sizes and is now a size 12 , weighing 12st 7lb			1
thrilled @entity6 from @entity21 , @entity29 said : ' i am the lightest i have ever been in 23 years			2
' i feel fabulous so much so that my head sometimes has to catch up with what i 've achieved as i still see myself as a ' big ' person			0
' people walk past me all the time and do n't recognise me and when i say it 's me they are astounded			0
' it is still almost unbelievable to me to be buying size 12 clothes and them fitting whereas before i would just grab any size 24 and pray that it fitted me			0
keen to look her best alongside her new man , @entity6 started a food optimising eating plan with @entity10			1
the plan encourages members to eat foods that satisfy the appetite and are low in energy density for example vegetables , pasta , potatoes and lean meat			0
@entity6 says that @entity12 's support was crucial in helping her drop from a size 24 ( right , holding her old jeans ) to a slim size 12 @entity6 said : ' i 've been a weight loss leader for ten years and @entity12 had been an on and off member for a few years			1
' he came back a few years ago and wanted to lose the weight he had put back on			2
' a friend of mine got in touch and said that @entity12 really liked me but was too shy to ask me out for a drink in case i said no. ' but we went on a date and when we had our first kiss i just knew that he was the man for me			2
' he admitted that despite wanting to lose weight the real reason he came back to the group and came every week was to see me			1
' the road to her stunning figure has not been easy and even as a @entity10 leader , @entity6 struggled to stick to the diet that has ultimately seen her waistline shrink			1
@entity6 is now helping @entity12 lose weight , and he has already lost 15lb of his goal of 8st the diet displays ' free foods ' which can be eaten without weighing or measuring			1
whereas higher density foods such as chocolate and crisps are controlled by a ' syns ' counting system and each member is allowed a certain amount of syns per day			0
she said : ' as a slimming world leader it was a bit embarrassing that i was giving all this advice to my members but not following it myself			0
' i always thought to myself i wonder what they think about me being in this job at the size i am			0
' all through my childhood i was called the chubby one			0
' i even remember teachers saying i was chubby and over the years as i have got bigger that complex has stayed			0
' everyday life became a chore and everything was an effort to the point where i could n't even fit in the bath properly			0
' i could n't put my shoes and socks on properly and was putting on weight in places that really freaked me out like my knees and the back of my neck			0
' @entity6 is hoping to now enter the @entity119 of the @entity121 competition after her dramatic weight loss			1
she said : ' i knew i needed to do something about my weight and having @entity12 spurred me on			1
' i knew that being overweight even if i was in a happy relationship would affect my self - esteem			0
' it gives me such a buzz when @entity12 tells me how proud he is of me and he is so supportive of my weight loss			1
@entity6 is now helping her boyfriend to fight the flab			1
chef @entity132 said : ' i am very proud of @entity6 's weight loss and i think she looks amazing			2
' my aim is to loose enough to be comfortable doing things i may struggle with now , for example to go places and sit comfortably in seats like the theatre and on planes			0
' i want to make @entity6 be as proud of me as i am of her			2
' @entity12 has already lost 15lb in just one week and hopes to lose a further 8st to get to his goal weight			1
she said : ' hopefully i can help @entity12 with his weight issues and make him feel as good as his encouragement makes me			2
' we are both in the mind set to lose weight now so we make sure if we go out for to restaurants we are making healthy choices			1
' it is easy to fall off the wagon with diets but @entity12 is really good and does n't tempt me with any naughty foods			0
' we are a good combination and are just as loved up as we were when we first met			0
