by @entity0 at first glance , these two images of the @entity2 , with the houses of @entity4 in the background , could be taken on the same day			0
but now compare them with another split image of the river - one showing a woman from the present day , the other showing a policeman from yesteryear			0
these remarkable pictures are actually stills from a film , illustrating a shot - by - shot comparison of @entity18 now and in 1927			2
it was 86 years ago that @entity20 - a cinema technician , filmmaker and cinematographer - travelled across the @entity22 with a new colour film camera to create his famous collection of films , @entity24			1
in early 2013 , another filmmaker , @entity38 , armed with his own camera , followed in the footsteps of @entity20 to make his own film @entity43 's column in @entity44 , as seen ( left ) in @entity20 's @entity18 segment of his famous collection of films , @entity24 , and , right , the scene today the filmmaker 's trip culminated in @entity18 with scenes that captured the daily life of @entity53 as well as several iconic cityscapes , such as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
