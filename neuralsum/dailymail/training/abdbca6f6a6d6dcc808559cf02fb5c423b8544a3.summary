moonlighting : of the 86 trusts which replied to @entity22 requests , 36 said they employed gps in a range of roles including assessing patients when they arrived , treating the less seriously - ill and providing general cover critics said it was extraordinary that doctors , who for the past decade have been allowed to choose not to work out - of - hours , were moonlighting at stretched @entity6 units for extra cash			1

a source at the firm said the rates were so good that doctors were travelling to the capital from all over the country , including one who drives 120 miles down from @entity72 to do two shifts a week			2
the firm covers all travel expenses and pays for @entity2 to stay in a three or four - star hotel if needed , on a budget of £ 60 a night , which is billed back to the @entity37			1

over the past decade the numbers of patients arriving in casualty has soared by 50 per cent and this has partly been blamed on failings of @entity98 out - of - hours ’ care			1
@entity2 have been allowed to opt out of working evenings and weekends since a botched contract negotiated in 2004 and services are largely provided by out - of - hours firms , which many patients do n’t trust			1
last night @entity107 , of @entity108 , said : ‘ gps ca n’t be prepared to turn out for their own patients but they are happy to work elsewhere for a lot more money			2
‘ so much for the interests of the patients , it ’s the interests of the doctors which are paramount			0
the reason patients are going to @entity6 is because they ca n’t get into their own surgery			0
’ @entity123 has fewer doctors per person than nearly all other @entity127 countries , according to a report			0
there are an average of 2.71 medics for every 1,000 people , compared to six in @entity133 , five in @entity134 and nearly four in @entity135			0
a @entity137 report ranks the @entity123 24th out of 27 countries in the @entity139 , ahead of only @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0

’ @entity158 mp @entity157 , a gp who sits on the @entity160 , said hiring gps in @entity162 could result in even more patients turning up as they realised they could see a doctor more quickly			2
she added : ‘ we need to make sure it ’s easier for people to see a gp out of hospital			0
’ it emerged yesterday that a third of gps want to charge patients up to £ 10 for going to @entity6 to try to reduce the number of ‘ inappropriate ’ attendances			2

a @entity206 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s not unusual for @entity6 departments to employ in - house @entity2 – they provide a valuable source of expertise and help patients to be seen and treated promptly			1
‘ we know that the whole system of out - of - hours care needs to be changed			0
