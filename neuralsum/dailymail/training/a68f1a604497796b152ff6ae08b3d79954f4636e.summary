by @entity0 published : 21:37 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 30 april 2013 women with a high risk of breast cancer could soon be given a drug to reduce their chance of getting the disease			1
landmark research has found that taking the hormone pill tamoxifen - or three other similar drugs - can reduce the risk by 40 per cent			1
the aim is to reduce the odds of developing breast cancer in the first place – just as statins are given to patients to ward off heart disease			1
@entity17 estimates that up to 10 per cent of women are considered to be at high risk of breast cancer - equivalent to around half a million people			1
the study found that taking osteoporosis drugs can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 40 per cent @entity25 has been used to treat the illness for more than 30 years , usually after surgery , saving the lives of hundreds of thousands at a cost of just a few pence a day			1
but it is not currently approved as a preventative treatment for breast cancer in the @entity31			2
the other drugs involved in the research , raloxifene , arzoxifene , and lasofoxifene , are all primarily treatments for the fragile bone disease osteoporosis			2
the @entity39 , the watchdog responsible for advising the @entity40 on good practice , provisionally recommended the medication in january			0
it is likely to make a decision in the summer , in a move that could benefit up to half a million women			0
a new study into the medical records of 83,000 women revealed that taking the drugs reduced the risk of developing breast cancer by 38 per cent			1
after five years of taking the medication the risk fell by 42 per cent			0
there was still a reduction of 25 per cent in women who had stopped taking the pill for five years			0
after five years of taking the medication the risk of breast cancer fell by 42 per cent @entity25 , a hormone pill already used to treat breast cancer , has the same effect as the bone disease drugs the drugs , known as selective oestrogen receptor modulators , target oestrogen - sensitive molecules on cells in the breast and other parts of the body			1
professor @entity70 , from @entity71 , who led the research said : ‘ these are very encouraging results			0
‘ [ they ] pave the way for more widespread use of these drugs in high risk women in a manner similar to the way statins and blood pressure lowering drugs are used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke			2
’ the risk of breast cancer in the general population is one in eight – but this rises to one in three for women at high risk and one in four for those at moderate risk			1
almost 50,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer			2
of these , around 2,400 have inherited faults in known breast cancer genes while a further 5,000 - 7,000 are affected by genes not yet identified			2
previous international trials showed that tamoxifen reduces the risk of the most common kind of breast cancer by one third after five years , with the preventative effect lasting up to 20 years			1
experts say the cost to the @entity40 would be relatively low because the drugs are not branded - plus fewer women would need treating for the disease			0
many breast cancers rely on the female sex hormone oestrogen to grow			0
these cancers are known as oestrogen - receptor positive ( @entity114 - positive ) breast cancers hormone - positive breast cancer cells have proteins called receptors , which sex hormones attach to			1
when oestrogen comes into contact with the receptors , it fits into them and stimulates the cancer cells to divide so that the tumour grows			0
@entity25 fits into the oestrogen receptor and blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells			2
this means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether			0
but despite the positive results from the research , the study showed that the drugs significantly increased the risk of blood clots , while tamoxifen raises the risk of developing womb cancer			2
@entity140 of @entity17 , which funded the study , said : ‘ these results provide some of the clearest evidence to date of the ability of these drugs to prevent breast cancer			1
the study also offers clarity on the frequency of side effects that can be expected from these drugs			0
she added : ‘ research like this has the potential to reduce the number of women diagnosed with the disease in the future			0
‘ we look forward to the final guidance from @entity39 and hope this marks the time when women have more options to reduce their risk of breast cancer			1
these drugs have a range of side - effects though , so they will not be suitable for all women			0
we urge them to discuss their options with their doctors			0

the hormone pill @entity25 is already used to treat breast cancer
but research *suggests* it may can reduce a woman *'s* risk of disease by 40 *%*
three other drugs used to treat osteoporosis may have same effect
