by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:58 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:31 est , 27 december 2013 onwards and upwards : prime minister @entity5 is likely to increase interest rates in 2014 half of pensioners want higher interest rates to counteract the disastrous effect of years of low returns on their savings			1
fifty per cent of the over- 60s say a rise in interest rates would make them better off , according to a survey			1
by contrast , just 7 per cent say their finances would suffer			0
over all ages , more people think they will benefit from higher interest rates , which is good news for @entity5 as a rate rise becomes more likely in the run - up to the election			1
the survey shows that two thirds of people believe an increase would improve their personal finances or would make no difference			2
the @entity32 has kept interest rates at 0.5 per cent since march 2009			1
chancellor @entity33 has cited the need to keep interest rates low as a justification for his austerity policies			1
higher rates are bad for homeowners , because they increase the cost of mortgage payments			2
it was thought this would make a rate increase unpopular , costing the @entity45 votes in 2015			0
but lower rates are bad for savers , who do not get as much interest on their nest eggs			2
rates at such a low level as 0.5 per cent mean that , when inflation is taken into account , savings are actually falling in value			2
many elderly people who rely on money saved throughout their lives to top up their pensions would welcome a rate rise			2
@entity60 , a former @entity61 adviser on pensions , said : ‘ those in or approaching retirement have often saved hard and expect to live on their savings , but what they ’ve experienced is a wipeout			0
‘ savings have been the sacrificial lamb of policies which have encouraged people to borrow			2
conditions : governor of the @entity32 @entity75 , has said he will only increase interest rates if unemployment falls below 7 per cent ‘ those who have been responsible have had their savings taken away , while those who have borrowed more than they can afford have had a huge bonanza			1
the message is , “ you ’re a mug to save because we could take it away at any time ”			0
‘ if one is retired , there is nothing you can do to retrieve your income in future – that ’s it			0
’ a rise in interest rates will be bad news for many homeowners who are mortgaged to the hilt , experts have warned			1
home repossessions will go up when interest rates rise and the glut of cheap home loan deals dry up as some households struggle to afford their mortgages			1
@entity104 , chief economist at the @entity105 , said : ‘ the benign period of falling arrears and possessions may be coming to an end			0
’ rock - bottom interest rates have been a boon to homeowners for almost five years			1
the number of repossessions has been dropping for years , with 30,000 expected this year , down from 75,500 during the 1991 recession			0
but the @entity32 estimates that 8 per cent of households are now ‘ vulnerable ’ – meaning they spend more than 35 per cent of their income before tax on mortgage repayments			0
it said this figure could double if it raises the base rate – frozen at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 – to 3 per cent			0
one in six households are mortgaged to the hilt , servicing home loans that are at least four times bigger than their annual salary			0
a pre-election rise in interest rates looks increasingly likely as the economy begins to recover			1
@entity32 governor @entity75 said he would only consider putting rates up if unemployment fell to 7 per cent , which is expected before the election in 2015			0
many had assumed such a move would be a disaster for @entity5 because it would push up the cost of millions of families ’ mortgages			2
@entity143 business secretary @entity142 has warned against an interest rate rise , saying : ‘ the danger of raising interest rates is that you hit those parts of the country which are not yet fully recovered and you push up the exchange rate			1
we do n’t want that			0
’ but the results of the @entity156 poll , in @entity157 , appear to show that a rise might not be a disaster for the @entity45			0
around 45 per cent of people expect rates to go up some time next year , of whom 31 per cent believe they would be better off as a result and 23 per cent say they would be poorer			1
a further 32 per cent said a rise or fall would make little difference , while 14 per cent said they did not know			0
@entity156 president @entity169 said : ‘ for the moment , when inflation looks set to stay low , a modest rise in interest rates is actually likely to please far more people than it troubles			1
‘ if @entity5 and @entity33 can preside over low consumer - price inflation but higher rises in the price of homes – and other assets such as shares – then some rise in interest rates is likely to win them more votes than it loses			1

people across all ages believe they would benefit from higher interest rates
this is good news for @entity5 as a rise becomes likely next year
