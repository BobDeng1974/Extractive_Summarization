by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 21:58 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 19 january 2013 @entity2 believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again , saying : ' i deserve to be punished			1
i 'm not sure that i deserve a death penalty			2
' the 41 - year - old @entity6 has confessed to using performance - enhancing drugs during all seven of his @entity9 victories			1
he was stripped of all results from august 1 , 1998 and banned from sport for life			2
@entity2 was competing in triathlons , mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future , suggesting a life ban is not right			1
@entity2 also has two more children from a second partner he told @entity41 in the second part of their television interview : ' i ca n't lie to you			1
i 'd love the opportunity to be able to compete , but that is n't the reason that i 'm doing this			2
' frankly , this might not be the most popular answer , but i think i deserve it ( to be able to compete again )			2
' i deserve to be punished			2
i 'm not sure that i deserve a death penalty			2
' eleven of @entity2 's former team - mates provided evidence against him in exchange for six - month suspensions			1
humbled : @entity2 said being separated from @entity59 was his must humbling moment he added : ' if you look at the situation , if you look at that culture , you look at the sport , you see the punishments			1
i could go back to that time ... you 're trading my story for a six - month suspension			2
that 's what people got			2
' i got a death penalty			0
i 'm not saying that that 's unfair , necessarily , but i 'm saying it 's different			0
' after years of denials , @entity2 confirmed that during his record run , from 1999 to 2005 , he used blood - boosting agent @entity79 , blood doping , testosterone , cortisone and human growth hormone			1
on the road : @entity84 's @entity2 rides ahead of @entity86 's @entity85 @entity87 : @entity2 undergoes a medical check - up in 2005 @entity2 , who was last october stripped of all results dating from august 1 , 1998 and banned from sport for life , denied doping during his comeback from retirement in 2009 , when he finished third in the @entity9 , and 2010 and refuted suggestions he paid off cycling 's world governing body , the @entity99 , to cover up a positive test in 2001			1
in hindsight he wishes he had co-operated with the @entity103 investigation which proved his downfall			0
co-operation could have meant a lesser penalty			0
regrets ? @entity2 wished he had confessed earlier so his punishment was lesser @entity2 's long - time sponsors each deserted him in quick succession following the publication of the @entity103 report , but the most challenging moment was when his own @entity59 , the charity known now as @entity59 , distanced itself from him			1
' the foundation is like my sixth child and to make that decision , and to step aside , was big , ' said @entity2 , who expressed his wish the charity can thrive without being associated with him			1
mixed reviews : some said @entity41 's interviewing style was excellent while others wish she pushed @entity2 further ' i would n't at all say [ i was ] forced out , told to leave			1
i was aware of the pressure			0
' it was the best thing for our organisation , but it hurt like hell			0
that was the lowest [ moment ]			2
' asked if he feels disgraced , @entity2 said : ' of course , but i also feel humbled			1
' it 's a process			0
and i think we 're at the beginning of the process			0
' deceit : @entity2 ' won ' the @entity9 seven times , all of which came with the help of drugs @entity2 confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons			1
his competitive desire remains , though			0
asked whether he believes his life ban should be overturned , he said : ' selfishly , yes			0
but realistically i do n't think that 's going to happen			0
and i have to live with that			0
' @entity41 asked @entity2 ' did anyone know the whole truth ? ' he replied ' yeah , ' but there was no follow - up to ascertain who			1
@entity2 says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not to use performance - enhancing drugs again , yet evidence in the @entity103 report points to the contrary			1
he maintains the last time he doped was during his 2005 @entity9 win			1
disgraced : @entity2 has admitted his history is ' ugly stuff ' @entity2 was emotional when discussing his 13 - year - old son @entity38 , with tears welling up in his eyes and hesitated in giving answers , his voice croaking			1
he had discovered @entity38 was defending him at school and had to address the matter			0
@entity2 said : ' that 's when i knew i had to tell him			1
he 'd never asked me			0
he 'd never said " @entity166 , is this true ? " he trusted me			0
he heard about it in the hallways			0
do n't defend me any more : @entity2 held back tears as he recalled talking to his son ' i said " do n't defend me anymore "			1
i said " if anyone says anything to you , do not defend me			2
just say my dad said he was sorry "			0
' he said " look , i love you , you 're my dad , this wo n't change that "			0
' thank @entity178 he 's more like @entity179 ( @entity2 's first wife and @entity38 's mother )			1
' emotional : @entity2 was close to tears when he explained how he admitted his cheating to children @entity38 , @entity37 and @entity36 the @entity184 insisted @entity2 did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one			1
yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed			0
his admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits , too			0
' i 've lost all future income , ' he said			2
' i do n't like thinking about it , but that was a 75million - dollar day			1
and probably never coming back			0
' @entity2 denied claims he attempted to make a payment to @entity103			1
he said : ' i had no knowledge of that , but i 've asked around			0
i think the claim was 250,000 dollars			0
that 's a lot of money			0
