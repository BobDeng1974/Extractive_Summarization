i was never one for going up to a player and asking for their shirt , though i did quite a few swaps			1
the most famous shirts i have are probably from some of the great @entity8 players i played alongside			2
i kept @entity10 shirts and some precious @entity8 ones , but when you have kids they will often ask you to swap with somebody so i ’ve got quite a few others			2
@entity16 asked for mine after the @entity19 final in 2001			1
we had been winning 1 - 0 but then @entity21 scored two to win it for @entity23			0
@entity25 's @entity24 challenges for the ball with @entity27 in the 2001 @entity19 final with @entity23 when @entity16 asked me i could n’t care less because the last thing i wanted to keep was a shirt from that final ! the trouble is his shirt now appears from a random box every now and then and every time it brings back all those bad memories			1
i remember seeing @entity37 players queueing up before a game to ask for @entity40 ’s shirt			1
as soon as that happened we knew we had them beaten			0
with @entity44 so many asked for his shirt that the club threatened to start making him pay for ones he gave away ! i ca n’t imagine why somebody would n’t want my shirt over @entity44 ’s ... @entity44 swaps shirts with @entity50 in 2004 and ( right ) @entity51 , then of @entity52 while it ’s one thing swapping shirts after a game , it ’s another doing it at half - time			1
that ’s inappropriate , especially when you ’re losing			0
when you ’re 3 - 0 down , it looks like you ’re giving up			0
it was probably deliberate from @entity62 , trying to defuse @entity63			0
but you should n’t be interacting with the opposition — you ’re not out to make friends			0
there is a lot wrong with @entity23 at the moment and you have to take collective responsibility for that			0
nobody should hide behind @entity73			2
@entity73 ( right ) trades shirts with @entity62 's @entity75 as they head into the @entity77 tunnel on wednesday			1

i was never one for going up to a player and asking for their shirt
@entity37 players queued up before a game to ask @entity40 for his
@entity16 wanted my shirt after we *'d* lost the 2001 fa *cup* final ... the last thing i wanted to keep was a memory from that defeat !
it was inappropriate for @entity73 to swap with @entity75 at half - time
