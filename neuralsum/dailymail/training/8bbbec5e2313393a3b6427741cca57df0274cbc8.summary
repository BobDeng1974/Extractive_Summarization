@entity0 is under pressure and facing the biggest challenge of his 93 - cap @entity4 career			1
there are four attacking positions in @entity8 ’s team and it is beyond dispute that @entity11 and @entity12 are now automatic names			0
@entity0 had that security once but he is now vying with @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 for the other two spots			1
time to perform : @entity0 must produce a good display in @entity4 's second @entity23 game against @entity24 to remind us of his class night of frustration : though @entity0 set up @entity4 's goal , scored by @entity11 , he struggled to contain @entity30 's @entity29 and @entity31 @entity32 : @entity8 must decide whether to keep @entity0 in his left - sided position against @entity24 on thursday playing him wide left against @entity30 — something i advocated 10 days ago — has increased the debate about his place in the starting line - up after he had problems containing the excellent combinations @entity29 and @entity31			1
in the months building up to the @entity23 , @entity8 was urged to be bold in his selection and that is exactly what he was			0
it is why the majority are still upbeat even though @entity46 began with a defeat in @entity48 that has left no margin for error			0
criticism of @entity0 came from the fact he looked lost defensively but , when you have a striker operating in that area , those are the risks associated with being more adventurous ; that he ventured into the space left by @entity29 to create @entity11 ’s goal showed the benefits of playing him there			0
@entity8 could have gone for a more solid line - up and played @entity19 but what would the reaction have been ? same old cautious @entity8			2
@entity0 , who should have equalised in the second - half , was put in the role so @entity4 had players coming from deep to cause @entity30 more problems and the system was also designed to stop the control that @entity72 would have on the game			1
no longer automatic : @entity0 faces competition from a number of players for his place in the @entity4 team competition : @entity12 occupied a central position against @entity30 in order to more effectively link up with striker @entity11 better form : @entity11 continued his scoring streak this season when he converted @entity0 's cross on 37 minutes @entity12 did the first bit brilliantly with a performance that showed he has come of age but the peerless @entity72 — and the outstanding @entity90 — could not be stopped pulling the strings with their remarkable pass completion statistics ; both were more than 90 per cent			1
@entity4 ’s problem on the left was more with @entity96 than @entity0			2
a full - back can see the whole picture but they were both caught in between positions too often ; @entity96 should have ordered @entity0 to tuck in and stop the supply to @entity31			2
the other option would have been for @entity0 to stick close to @entity29 and @entity96 could have pushed on to @entity31			1
defensive duties : @entity0 attempts to block a cross by the impressive @entity31 but @entity30 held the upper hand on that flank for much of the match tormented : @entity31 caused endless problems for @entity96 in the @entity4 left - back position this culminated in the winning goal when @entity96 was caught between pressing @entity29 or staying with @entity31			1
he did neither and @entity4 paid the ultimate price			0
the communication from @entity96 should have been better			0
@entity24 , however , do not have a playmaker like @entity72 and that means @entity0 can take a more central role on thursday			2
people will say ‘ why should we accommodate him ? ’ when @entity12 was so impressive in that role against @entity30			0
i just feel with @entity24 ’s defence in disarray after the defeat to @entity124 , @entity12 could terrorise whoever plays at right - back in the absence of the suspended @entity128 and @entity0 could wreak havoc in the middle			0
midfield masters : @entity4 captain @entity132 congratulates @entity30 's @entity72 after the match return ? @entity134 is likely to be in the @entity24 team when they face @entity4 on thursday after recovering from a knee injury another persuasive factor for @entity0 to start is the fact he offers goals			1
he has yet to break his duck at a @entity23 finals but , even so , he has got 39 for @entity4 and when he sets foot on to a pitch he will firmly believe he can score at this level			0
taking him out of the team would dilute @entity4 ’s threat and it has to be remembered the combined international tally of @entity18 , @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity16 stands at nine — and @entity18 has eight of those			1
would any of them have the same belief as @entity0 ? no player should be included on the back of past glories and it is clear that @entity16 and @entity17 are breathing down his neck			2
but until he plays in his favoured central role , firm judgements about @entity0 should be reserved			0
replacement : @entity17 could come in for @entity0 if @entity8 decides to drop him for the next match in contention : @entity16 could start against @entity24 after coming off the bench in the @entity30 match if we do not get that performance in his favoured position it may be time to make changes but , right now , the time has come for @entity0 to deliver			1
he needs a performance to remind us why he was an automatic selection for so long .			0

@entity0 faces the biggest test of his 93 - cap @entity4 career
he is no longer an automatic selection for @entity8 and faces competition from @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
@entity0 and @entity96 had problems containing @entity29 and @entity31 against @entity30
@entity184 *forward* must perform against @entity24 on thursday
