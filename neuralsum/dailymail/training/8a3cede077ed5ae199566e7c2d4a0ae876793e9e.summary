the haemangioma rapidly grew to the size of a fist and she had to have an operation to remove the growth			2
but surgeons at @entity20 , in @entity21 , severed the nerves in one side of her face during the operation , causing severe paralysis on the right side of her face			1
this left @entity1 , who lived in @entity32 , @entity33 , without the ability to smile and despite attempts to correct the problem , the nerve could n’t be repaired			1
her parents @entity39 , 38 , and @entity40 , 40 , instructed lawyers at @entity42 who secured a full admission of responsibility from @entity21 and @entity46			2
yesterday at the @entity47 in @entity48 the judge , @entity49 , approved a settlement from the health board to fund @entity1 ’s on - going treatment			2

mr and mrs @entity1 were initially told by doctors that @entity1 ’s facial palsy would be temporary			2
but over time it became clear the nerve had been completely severed rather than damaged			0
they were told that the facial palsy could be corrected , but they would have to wait until @entity1 was older for the surgery			2
shortly after her birth , @entity1 developed a large non-cancerous tumour on her neck			1
it was during surgery to remove it that a nerve in her face was severed when she was four - and - a - half she had a nerve removed from her calf which was grafted onto the good nerve in her face			1
the second stage of the procedure was performed in 2009 but the surgery did not work			0
at a hearing last year , @entity21 and @entity46 admitted full responsibility for failing to safeguard the seventh cranial nerve - the nerve which controls facial expression - before removal of the growth			1
they admitted severing the nerve during @entity1 ’s operation and failing to carry out appropriate surgical treatment during the procedure to attempt to repair it			1
the hospital also failed to attempt to repair the smiling nerve within reasonable time of discovering @entity1 had developed facial palsy			1
@entity1 has had surgery to try and repair the damage but it was unsuccessful @entity1 now has multiple scars on her face and body and has suffered bullying as a result of the facial palsy			1
the brave little girl has decided she will undergo another procedure to try and rectify the damage from her first operation and is hoping to have the operation next summer			0
mrs @entity1 , a full - time mother , said : ‘ i am in complete awe of my daughter and how much she has overcome in her short life			0
‘ she has really struggled through the years to come to terms with her facial palsy			0
‘ facial palsy can be extremely isolating and while friends empathise , they can never truly understand the depth of emotion or effect it has on your life			0
‘ i think of the importance people place on a smile , about her graduation photo , her wedding photo and all the first impressions she will have to face in her future and my heart breaks over and over			0
@entity1 is now considering having further surgery in a bid to enable her to smile ‘ as a family we have felt like we have been on a rollercoaster , so many ups and downs , but we are stronger because of it			1
‘ @entity1 is the bravest , kindest person i know and hopefully the next operation will work , but if it does n’t i know she ’ll pick herself up again and i ’ll be right beside her every step of the way			2
’ there are around 100,000 in the @entity144 who suffer from facial palsy with at least 30 different causes , according to the charity @entity148 @entity144			0
@entity149 , a partner and medical law expert at @entity42 , represented @entity1 ’s family			0
she said : ‘ we are pleased for @entity1 and her family that we have secured an admission of responsibility from the @entity46			2
@entity20 of @entity157 has accepted responsibility for the damage to @entity1 's facial nerves ‘ from such a young age , @entity1 has suffered a series of painful procedures and has bravely coped with facial disfigurement which the @entity46 admits , could have been avoided			1
‘ not only has @entity1 suffered from physical ailments , she has also endured many years of bullying at school due to her facial palsy which has been heart - breaking for her parents to see their daughter suffer at school amongst her peers			0
‘ the settlement will cover the cost of future medical treatment , future loss of earnings and the pain and suffering caused to @entity1 and we hope the @entity46 will also offer the family an official apology given the severity of the impact the errors have had			0
’ a spokesman for @entity21 and @entity185 , said : ' the health board is very sorry for what has happened and we would like to offer our sincere apologies to @entity1 and her family			1
