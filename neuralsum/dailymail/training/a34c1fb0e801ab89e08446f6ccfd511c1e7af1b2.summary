by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 10 june 2013 the man behind one of the most significant leaks in @entity5 history has revealed himself as a high school drop - out who turned against his government when he realized it was ' doing far more harm than good '			1
as @entity12 steps from the shadows to explain his reasons for leaking information from the @entity16 , questions are emerging over how the failed student rose up the ranks to become gatekeeper of the government 's biggest secrets			1
@entity12 , 29 , spoke to @entity22 from a hotel room in @entity24 where he is on the run after leaking sensitive documents on how the @entity16 has gleaned personal data from internet companies			1
he had access to the @entity16 's top secrets after a steep rise to work for government contractor @entity33 , which paid him $ 200,000 a year to work on the the agency 's computer systems			1
the whistleblower : @entity12 , who worked as a contract employee at the @entity16 , is pictured in @entity24 after identifying himself as the man who leaked the agency 's secrets while there , the @entity16 let him see ' everything ' , he said - a baffling position considering his limited credentials			1
@entity12 grew up in in @entity46 , @entity47 , before later moving to @entity48 , near the headquarters of the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) at @entity50			1
public records show his mother is a government employee - a deputy clerk for the @entity54 in @entity48 - the @entity51 reported			2
he took just a few ' computer ' classes at a community college in a bid to get his high - school equivalency degree , yet he failed to complete them			1
despite no qualifications , @entity22 , which interviewed him at a secret location , called him ' a master on computers ' and ' happiest when talking about the technical side of surveillance '			1
as a teenager he dreamed of defending the @entity68 as a soldier in the @entity70 and began a training program to join the @entity72 in 2003			0
he told @entity22 he wanted to fight in the @entity74 war because he felt he had an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression - the same reason he is giving to justify his leaks			1
far from home : the home in @entity83 , @entity84 , where @entity12 lived with his girlfriend until recently @entity12 has fled to @entity24 , which is a gamble , but the country 's free speech laws mean he does have a slim chance of avoiding being swept back to @entity5 if the government demand he returns			1
@entity24 signed an extradition treaty with the @entity5 in 1997 , just before @entity92 handed it back to @entity93			2
in it both agreed to send fugitives back and forth in the majority of cases , but there were also political exemptions negotiated at the time			0
@entity24 has the ' right of refusal when surrender implicates the " defense , foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy '' of the @entity93 '			2
@entity93 itself has no extradition treaty with @entity5 at all			0
@entity24 officials also have the right to say no to extradition if they believe that the attempt is ' politically motivated '			2
this means that they will protect free speech if a person is being arrested just for their political opinions			0
the @entity5 may have already approached @entity119 or its consulate in @entity24 to start proceedings			2
they will use the @entity123 to gain warrants for his arrest			0
@entity24 's authorities can hold @entity12 for 60 days , following a @entity5 request that includes probable cause , while @entity130 prepares a formal extradition request			1
' i think it is really tragic that an @entity5 has to move to a place that has a reputation for less freedom , ' he told @entity22			2
but he was stunned when he began his training			0
' most of the people training us seemed pumped up about killing @entity140 , not helping anyone , ' he said			0
after he broke both his legs in a training accident , he was discharged			0
the @entity22 added that @entity12 had tried to join the elite special forces but had been unsuccessful			1
records show he enlisted in the army reserve as a special forces recruit in may 2004 and was discharged that september			0
an army spokesman told the @entity22 that he did not complete any training or receive any awards			1
he got his first @entity16 job working as a security guard at one of the agency 's facilities at the @entity156 before moving to the @entity157 to work on it security			1
there , he rose quickly , making a bizarrely large leap to having access to more and more top - secret documents as he climbed the ranks			0
on its hiring site , the @entity16 says each role requires a different application process			2
but it says that applicants ' can expect their hiring process to include medical screening , a polygraph interview , drug test , and an extensive background investigation '			0
it adds that the background check helps determine the person 's ' honesty , trustworthiness , reliability , discretion , and unquestioned loyalty to the @entity5 ' and requires interviews with family and colleagues			0
it is unknown which checks @entity12 underwent before his job as a security guard , and whether these checks were repeated as he rose through the ranks			2
the @entity16 does give hiring preference to former military , according to its website			2
in 2007 , the @entity157 stationed him with diplomatic cover in @entity193 , @entity194 , where he was responsible for maintaining computer network security and privy to more secrets than ever before			2
despite his lackluster resume , he was not only privy to the agency 's surveillance systems , he also had the ability to use them , he told the @entity22 in a video interview			1
' i , sitting at my desk , certainly had the authorities [ sic ] to wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president if i had a personal email , ' he said			0
after soaring up the ranks at the @entity16 and then as a contractor , he said there came a moment when he realized his government was ' doing more harm than good '			1
surveillance : policemen stand outside the @entity5 consulate in @entity24 ; @entity12 fled to the country after releasing information about the @entity16 to @entity22 newspaper but his location is unknown ' much of what i saw in @entity193 really disillusioned me about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world , ' he said			1
he told @entity22 of one incident where @entity157 operatives got a @entity194 banker drunk in an effort to recruit him as an informant to obtain secret banking information			2
he said they encouraged him to drive home intoxicated and when he was arrested for @entity240 , the undercover agents offered to help , managing to recruit the banker on the back of the favour			0
@entity12 said this and other things he witnessed in @entity193 disillusioned him about how his government worked and how this in turn impacted the world			1
' i realized that i was part of something that was doing far more harm than good , ' he said			0
he said he was disappointed president @entity252 advanced the policies he was hoping the newly elected president was stamp out and that ' hardened ' him			0
explaining why he decided to leave the @entity5 , he said : ' i do n't want to live in a society that does these sort of things ... i do not want to live in a world where everything i do and say is recorded			0
' on the run : visitors walk into @entity264 , @entity12 was reported to have checked out of on monday in hiding : @entity12 is in @entity24 , pictured , and said he does not expect ever to return home @entity12 was previously a technical officer for the @entity157 and worked at the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) as an employee of @entity267 , a private contractor , before being hired by @entity33 as an infrastructure analyst for the @entity16 in @entity84			1
he said he was also stationed in @entity269 at one point			0
he worked as an infrastructure analyst for @entity33 before telling his employers he needed to take a break for treatment for epilepsy			0
he told his girlfriend he needed to travel for work			0
in a statement , the company confirmed @entity12 had been an employee for less than three months and had been assigned to a team in @entity84			1
' news reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking , and if accurate , this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm , ' it said			0
@entity12 said he was content to sever his ' very comfortable life ' , which included a six - figure salary , a girlfriend , a home in @entity84 and his family , to shine a light on the @entity16 's widening surveillance net			1
and while his decision to reveal his identity may seem strange considering the potential ramifications , he said : ' i have no intention of hiding who i am because i know i have done nothing wrong			0

@entity12 , 29 , leaked details of @entity308 , a @entity16 program he says harvests personal data from internet
he has fled to @entity24 from @entity84 , where he worked as computer technician for government contractor on $ 200,000 a year salary
