@entity0 last night established himself at the head of a growing @entity3 rebellion over @entity4			1
the former shadow home secretary , who stood against @entity6 for the @entity3 leadership , said there were ‘ huge risks ’ in bombing @entity4			1
he added : ‘ this will be interpreted around the @entity11 in ways we ca n’t predict			0
i ’m also not at all sure that it will improve the safety of @entity17 citizens			0
’ testing : @entity19 chemical weapons experts wearing gas masks carry samples collected from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in @entity25 yesterday mr @entity0 also warned he had yet to be convinced the lethal chemical attack was a ‘ deliberate act of the @entity29 government ’			1
fellow @entity3 @entity30 , a former minister and soldier , said he would vote against the @entity4 intervention tonight and in any potential second vote			1
he said : ‘ i have n’t seen any evidence that suggests whether or not the regime was responsible for this and identifying who in the regime ( gave the order )			2
‘ the @entity19 weapons inspectors will establish that there was a chemical attack , they ’re not going to be able to establish who carried it out			1
’ @entity45 , who has helped organise a @entity3 rebellion that now numbers dozens , said : ‘ i am starting from a position of voting against but let ’s see what @entity6 comes up			1
’ rebels : former shadow home secretary @entity0 says bombing in @entity4 carries ' huge risks ' and leadership aspirant @entity55 is wary of the @entity17 people 's reaction live tweeting : @entity58 tweeted a picture showing prime minister @entity6 chairing a @entity60 former defence minister @entity61 warned of the risk that the @entity17 and allies ‘ get our hand caught in the mangle ’ by intervening in the civil war			1
‘ where will this military intervention lead on ? ’ he said			2
‘ will that be the end of the story or will there be calls for further action and are we then at risk of having our hand caught in the mangle ? ‘ i hope that when the government says no decision has been made , that that is genuinely the case			2
’ fellow @entity3 sir @entity81 said he remained to be convinced that ‘ any intervention now will be other than too little , too late and ineffective ’			1
he said he was ‘ gravely concerned ’ about the implications of punitive action against the regime			0
‘ any such response must be based first upon legality , must be proportionate and must be effective , ’ he added			0
across the road : as @entity77 discussed actions , a protest calling for no military attack took place on the other side of the road possible attack : a victim is rushed to hospital for suspected napalm or white phosphorous burns after a suspected attack which the opposition claimed @entity29 's regime was responsible for sir @entity81 said the experience of being persuaded to vote in favour of the @entity110 war on false information ‘ has left with me deep cynicism about the veracity of “ military intelligence ” that may or may not have been adjusted to suit a particular political purpose ’			1
self - styled @entity3 leadership hopeful @entity55 also came out against a military strike			1
he said : ‘ the @entity17 public have absolutely no appetite for being unnecessarily dragged into yet another @entity11 conflict			0
‘ they just do n’t want us to get involved			0
’ former security minister @entity121 said the government needed to be ‘ cautious ’ about the evidence it was considering , and publish legal advice on military intervention			2
she said : ‘ the public should be informed of the legal basis on which the government is acting			0
having a good evidence trail is going to be extremely important			0
’ @entity131 leader @entity130 last night slammed the ‘ rush for military action ’			1
he said : ‘ sending cruise missiles into @entity4 as a punishment for possibly using chemical weapons – how does that make anything better ? ’ would bombing @entity4 be lawful ? @entity17 and the @entity139 insist it would be , but the truth is far from clear			1
it ’s hard to see how @entity4 ’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country			1
what specific laws or @entity19 conventions might be used as justification ? the @entity149 allows for military action on only two grounds – in self - defence , or if action is approved by the @entity154			1
@entity156 has made clear its intention to veto any proposed @entity60 resolution authorising action – as has @entity160			0
can a military strike be legal without a @entity19 resolution ? unclear			0
in 1999 , the @entity164 bombing campaign against @entity165 was launched without one , with @entity166 and president @entity167 seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect @entity171 civilians			2
the intervention was widely welcomed , but its legality was questionable			0
a similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in @entity4			2
if president @entity29 is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people , he will be in breach of the @entity180 , an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which @entity4 is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons			1
but breaching the protocol does n’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts , rather than civil wars			1
does the @entity19 have a ‘ responsibility to protect ’ the @entity4 ? in 2005 , following the hideous atrocities committed in @entity192 and @entity193 in the 1990s , the @entity19 brought forward an initiative called the ‘ responsibility to protect ’			2
it was designed to protect the innocent from genocide , war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders , and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere			0
but former @entity19 assistant secretary - general , @entity205 , says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force			0
all diplomatic efforts must have been tried first , and even then military intervention requires the backing of the @entity60 – taking @entity6 and president @entity212 back to square one			0
does the pm need parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign ? technically , no. he retains the power , under @entity218 , to use military force without parliamentary approval			2
however , all recent major military interventions – including the wars in @entity110 and @entity223 – have been preceded by a @entity225 vote			0
the government has made clear it will ‘ respect the outcome ’ of tonight ’s .			0

several @entity3 *mps* *hesitant* over military action against @entity29
@entity0 said bombing @entity4 carried ' huge risks '
demand evidence @entity29 used chemical weapons on civilians
