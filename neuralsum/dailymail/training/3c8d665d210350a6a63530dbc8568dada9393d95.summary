investigators are now urgently trying to work out who capt. @entity1 spoke to in the cockpit before the plane took off on march 8			1
there is a hope that the phone call could hold the answer to the plane 's mysterious disappearance			1
they have refused to publicly comment on the investigation , reported the @entity23 investigators are still looking into the pilot 's background although yesterday @entity28 's defense minister @entity27 told a news conference he is considered innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing , and that members of his family are cooperating in the investigation			1
meanwhile today search aircraft and ships are investigating two objects floating in the southern @entity36 off @entity37 that could be debris from a @entity28 jetliner missing for 12 days with 239 people on board			2
@entity37 officials said the objects were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe , around 2,500 km ( 1,500 miles ) southwest of @entity48 in the vast oceans between @entity37 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
the larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres ( 79 ft ) , long and appeared to be floating on water several thousand metres deep , they said			2
the second object was about 5 metres ( 16 feet ) long			2
the hunt for the @entity56 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared march 8 above the @entity58 most of the relatives said they did not want to comment until there was more solid information out of @entity37			1
one father was adamant that he would not give up hope saying : ' nothing is definite			1
i hope my sons returns			1
my son is still alive			2
' another family member refused to be drawn on the news saying : ' we ca n't respond to the news until it is definitely confirmed			0
' discussing the families ' ordeal @entity28 's acting transport minister @entity27 said today : ' my sympathies , my heart is with them all the time			1
' the debris was spotted on satellite imagery and a total of four aircraft have been sent to investigate the sighting , some 1553 miles off the coast of @entity48 pictured : satellite pictures released by the @entity85 of the object thought to be related to the search for @entity88 officials cautioned it could take several days to confirm if they were parts of the missing plane			1
' it 's credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field , ' @entity94 air commodore @entity93 told a news conference in @entity105			1
no confirmed wreckage from @entity88 has been found since it vanished from air traffic control screens off @entity28 's east coast early on march 8 , less than an hour after taking off from @entity10 for @entity109			1
' i can confirm we have a new lead , ' @entity28 transport minister @entity27 told reporters in @entity10 , where the investigation into the missing airliner is based			1
another official in @entity28 said investigators were ' hopeful but cautious ' about the @entity37 discovery			0
this is the agonising moment that families are anxiously awaiting news of the missing @entity7 flight were told two large objects bobbing in a remote part of the @entity36 had been found @entity127 relatives of passengers from the missing @entity88 react as they wait for news at the @entity130 the fate of @entity88 has been baffling aviation experts for nearly two weeks			0
investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the @entity137 and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane 's communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course			1
exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have not yielded anything that might explain why			0
an @entity37 air force @entity148 plane was already at the scene , @entity150 , general manager of the emergency response division of @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , told the news conference in @entity105			1
three more aircraft were also on their way , including a @entity156 @entity155 and a @entity157 , the world 's most advanced maritime surveillance plane			1
a merchant ship diverted for the task was also arriving in the area , @entity150 said			0
a @entity164 ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route , but was still ' some days away '			0
@entity127 , whose citizens made up about two - thirds of the passengers on board the flight , said it was also sending ships to the area of the sighting , but it was not clear how long it would take for the vessels to reach the scene			1
@entity85 ( @entity85 ) general manager @entity150 is seen next to an @entity85 graphic map during a press conference on the search for the @entity88 the huge potential breakthrough in an investigation that had appeared to be running out of leads was revealed by @entity37 prime minister @entity187 , who told parliament the objects had been located with satellite imagery			0
' new and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for @entity88 in the southern @entity36 , ' @entity187 said			0
he added that he had already spoken with his @entity28 counterpart , @entity194 , and cautioned that the objects had yet to be identified			0
' the task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for @entity88 , ' @entity187 said			0
@entity150 , the @entity37 official , said it could be some days before authorities have anything to report and added that poor visibility reported in the area could hamper the search			0
search area : the objects spotted by satellite are in one of the most remote areas of the planet in waters thousands of feet deep ' it 's probably the best lead we have right now but we have to get there , find them , see them , assess them , to know whether it 's really meaningful or not , ' he said.images released by @entity37 showed the satellite pictures were from @entity224 company @entity223 and were taken on march 16			1
arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water			0
the dimensions given are consistent with at least one of the objects possibly being the major part of a 777 - @entity137 wing , which is around 27 metres ( 89 feet ) long , though @entity37 officials cautioned the first images were indistinct			0
the relatively large size of the objects would also suggest that , if they do come from the missing aircraft , it was intact when it went into the water			0
investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that , minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the @entity58 , the plane turned sharply west , re-crossing the @entity248 and following an established commercial route towards @entity250			1
what happened next is unclear , but faint electronic ' pings ' picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours			0
that would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern @entity36			2
the methodical shutdown of the communications systems , together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back , has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot			2
the @entity265 is helping @entity28 authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane , after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month			2
relatives of passengers , who have been huddled at a @entity109 hotel , attended the daily briefing earlier today , but were then urgently called back when the news broke one father was adamant that he would not give up hope saying : ' nothing is definite			1
i hope my sons returns			2
my son is still alive ' @entity127 relatives of passengers from the missing @entity88 react as they wait for news at the @entity130 military planes from @entity37 , the @entity224 and @entity156 have been covering a search region over the southern @entity36 that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers ( 232,000 square miles ) to 305,000 square kilometers ( 117,000 square miles ) a relative of @entity127 passengers aboard the missing @entity7 , @entity88 , left , is surrounded by journalists as he leaves after learning about the latest debris field found in a remote part of the @entity36 a @entity28 official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53 - year - old pilot , @entity1 , had played were being looked at			1
' we are following up on the data logs being erased , ' the source said			0
' these could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory , so it may not lead us to anything			0
he played a lot of games , going into hundreds and thousands of hours			0
' an unprecedented multinational search for the plane has focused on two vast search corridors : one arcing north overland from @entity316 towards the @entity317 , the other curving south across the @entity36 from west of @entity322 's @entity321 island to west of @entity37			1
@entity37 is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor , with assistance from the @entity157			0
the depth of the water where the possible debris has been sighted would likely make recovering the ' black box ' voice and data recorders that may finally unlock the mystery of what happened aboard flight mh370 extremely challenging			0
@entity336 professor of oceanography @entity337 said that , based on currents in the area , if the debris is from the plane it probably would have gone into the water around 300 - 400 km ( 180 - 250 miles ) to the west			2
the search area covered an ocean ridge known as @entity348 , a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres ( 9,800 feet ) deep , @entity345 said			0
the plateau is about 250 km ( 150 miles ) wide by 400 km ( 250 miles ) long , and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres ( 16,400 feet ) deep			0
' whichever way you go , it 's deep , ' he said .			2
