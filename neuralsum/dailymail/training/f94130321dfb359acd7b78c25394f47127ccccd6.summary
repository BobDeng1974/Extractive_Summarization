by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 15:20 est , 16 august 2013 a @entity2 man is fighting for custody after his live - in girlfriend dumped their baby son at a fire station a week ago , fearing she would ' stab him			1
' the man , who has n't been identified , said he did n't know the mother , who has also not been unnamed , had abandoned the eight - month - old child until he saw it on the news and claims she lied when he asked where the boy was			1
firefighters at @entity16 's @entity15 discovered the infant on monday when they returned from a call and heard crying			1
at about 10:05 , they heard a baby crying , ' @entity29 spokesman captain @entity28 told @entity31			1
they went outside and found the child in a stroller			0
' they immediately grabbed the baby and took him inside out of the heat because it 's very hot in @entity16 right now , ' @entity28 said			1
the baby was ' clean , well - fed and well - dressed ' and firefighters played with him until protective services arrived			1
the boy was then taken to the hospital to be examined			0
' he was released yesterday evening from the hospital and placed in a foster home , ' @entity45 spokesman @entity44 told @entity48			1
the man said his girlfriend told him she was dropping the infant with his ' real father ' when she abandoned him at the station			1
he believes he is the child 's father though a dna test to confirm paternity is underway			1
news : the boyfriend did n't know the child had been abandoned until he saw the stroller and jumpsuit , pictured , on the news the mother came forward at an emergency hearing on tuesday			1
she said she abandoned the baby because she could n't take care of him but @entity44 would n't give details			1
a source told @entity69 the mother explained to the judge she dropped the baby off because she was afraid she might stab him			2
neighbors said she recently tried to leave the child with its grandfather and kicked another son , a teenager , out of the house			0
' she did n't come forward to claim him , ' @entity44 said			2
' she really just came forward to say , " i am the mother and these are the reasons i surrendered him			2
" ' under @entity2 law , parents who can not care for their child can leave the infant at a safe place such as a fire station , hospital or @entity90 station up to the age of 60 days , without facing questions or charges			2

a dna sample will be taken confirm paternity and the infant will remain in foster care in the meantime			0
@entity28 applauded the woman 's actions			0
' the lady still showed a lot of courage , ' he said			0
' i do n't know what 's going on in her life			0
sometimes they feel so desperate they do n't see any other way out			0
' i 'd rather have them taken to a fire station than for me to make those calls where i find a baby in a dumpster or a ditch			0
