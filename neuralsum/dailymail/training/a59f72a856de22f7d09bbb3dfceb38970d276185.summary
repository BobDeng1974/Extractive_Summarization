do n't let that huggable exterior fool you			0
underneath that furry frame their lies a bear with an attitude – just ask poor @entity6			2
the @entity8 woman was out walking her two dogs two weeks ago when they pulled her toward a koala near the bottom of a tree			1
but instead of nonchalantly ignoring her as is usually the case , this killer koala attacked the two dogs , with @entity17 getting caught up between them			1
it was only after she prised her fingers into its mouth that it released its grip			0
“ obviously the koala felt very threatened because it attached itself with its mouth , jaws , to my leg and bit very hard , bit very deeply , ” she told @entity28			2
@entity17 shows the scar that was left after the koala 's bite she then hobbled 2km home with her terrified pooches before finally being admitted to hospital			1
she ended up with a swollen and painful foot , but luckily it did not get infected			0
people should keep their distance if they spot a koala out in the wild experts say , especially those walking dogs , as koalas will act aggressively towards them			1
the @entity8 woman will be more careful when she walks her dogs in the future			0

@entity6 was out walking her dogs when she was attacked
the koala snapped its jaws on to @entity17 's left leg and would not let go
she hobbled 2km home before finally being admitted to hospital
after the attack she was left *nursing* a wound that required 12 stitches
