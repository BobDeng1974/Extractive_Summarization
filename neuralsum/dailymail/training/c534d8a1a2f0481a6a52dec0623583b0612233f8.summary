by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 4 may 2013 @entity1 has a healthy parliamentary majority in @entity3 of over 14,700 – but should his arrest trigger a by - election , it could still present a huge headache for @entity7			1
even before @entity10 ’s @entity9 emerged as the ‘ fourth force ’ in @entity13 politics last week , the constituency had a history of causing difficulty for conservative prime ministers			2
in 1991 , mr @entity1 was the @entity17 candidate for @entity3 when cabinet minister @entity18 was elevated to the @entity19 – triggering a poll in which the party ’s majority of 19,528 turned into a @entity24 majority of 4,601			1
despite @entity1 's ( left ) healthy majority in his @entity3 constituency , a by - election could still pose a headache for @entity7 , right although mr @entity1 won the seat back for the conservatives at the next year ’s general election , the party is still scarred by the memory of the @entity24 – then just three years old as a party , and @entity9 ’s predecessors as the natural ‘ party of protest ’ – increasing their share of the vote by a whopping 27 per cent			1
it was one of the largest swings in by - election history			1
mr @entity1 has not been charged with any offence , but if he subsequently chose to stand down from @entity44 in the wake of the allegations , @entity9 would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first @entity50 mp			2
at the last election , mr @entity1 took 50 per cent of the vote ; @entity53 were in second place , on 22 per cent , with the @entity24 third on 20 per cent and @entity9 fourth , with just under seven per cent			1
waiting : mr @entity1 has not been charged with any offence , but if he subsequently chose to stand down from @entity44 in the wake of the allegations , @entity10 's @entity9 would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first mp however , if the party could match the surge it managed in the @entity62 earlier this year , when it increased its share of the vote by eight-fold to 28 per cent , then victory would be within its grasp			1
although @entity10 says in an interview with today ’s @entity69 that he will not consider standing for @entity44 himself until after the 2014 @entity71 elections , his party ’s stunning performance in last week ’s council elections – taking 139 seats and securing 23 per cent of the vote – would still give his party the ideal springboard			0
@entity3 , which was created as a constituency in 1983 , is a wealthy , rural area which is traditionally more right - of - centre in its voting patterns than the rest of @entity84			2
in last week ’s council elections @entity53 finished just four seats short of outright victory on the county council			0
the party was holding discussions with the @entity24 over the weekend to oust the conservatives from power			0
@entity9 did not gain any seats , but was blamed by conservative councillors for cutting into their share of the vote			0
in the wake of the results , the council ’s conservative deputy leader , @entity96 , said : ‘ i blame @entity7 for this			0
‘ he needs to listen			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

mr @entity1 's constituency saw one of the biggest swings in history in 1991
a by - election saw a @entity17 majority of 19,500 turn into a @entity24 majority
