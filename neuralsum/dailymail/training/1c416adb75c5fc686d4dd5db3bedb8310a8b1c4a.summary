by @entity0 last updated at 7:54 am on 16th november 2011 perhaps she just wanted to take her mind off her split from long - term boyfriend @entity4			0
for just days after her newly - single status first leaked out , @entity6 was enjoying a weekend - long shoot at the stately pile of her close friend , @entity10 , the @entity5 understands			1
accompanied by a small group of friends , the @entity11 of @entity13 ’s vivacious younger sister spent three days taking pot - shots at grouse on his family estate in the @entity20			0
over the summer , @entity6 and @entity10 were seen at endless social events , including the @entity23 championships in june @entity10 's parents @entity25 and @entity26 at their home , @entity11 ’s @entity28 , which features as @entity29 in the @entity31 films @entity10 – or to give him his proper title , @entity11 , son of the 12th @entity11 – also invited @entity6 , 27 , to join his family at a remembrance sunday service held at @entity37 @entity36 in the nearby village of @entity28			1
she took a place in the front pew along with his parents , the @entity11 and @entity11 , and grandmother , @entity42 of @entity11 , duchess @entity42			2
@entity10 , 27 , sat in the row behind			2
the @entity45 , who led the service , admitted he had noticed a rather ‘ attractive ’ lady in the front row but had no idea it was the future king ’s sister - in - law			1
the pair have been confidantes since they shared a flat at @entity56 ‘ i had noticed an attractive lady in the front row , but i did not realise it was her			1
she did look like @entity6 , ’ he said			1
@entity36 's new priest , father @entity60 , had welcomed the group into the church but also failed to notice @entity6 and remarked : ‘ that shows how much we know about what is going on			1
’ but an unnamed worshipper said : ‘ it caused a bit of a stir in the church			2
’ according to friends , @entity10 was one of the few men who made @entity6 ’s beau a little green around the gills			1
royal sources say that while @entity6 ’s friendship with the heir to one of the richest and grandest dukedoms in the land was n’t the reason for their split , @entity4 never felt entirely comfortable with the closeness of their relationship			2
the pair have been confidantes since they shared a flat at @entity56 along with @entity89 , son of the @entity90			1
over the summer the couple were seen at endless social events , including the @entity23 championships			0
the night before the tennis @entity6 and @entity10 were also seen enjoying a three - hour dinner together in a @entity97 restaurant near @entity98 before returning to his @entity99 flat where she was eventually seen leaving at 2am			1
bizarrely , @entity10 shares a flat with another of @entity6 ’s ex ’s , @entity102			1
there was also a long weekend in @entity104 with a gaggle of girlfriends shortly after the royal wedding in may , where the affable aristocrat was seen squiring @entity6 out to several of the city ’s hottest nightspots as rowing her around a boating lake			2
@entity112 , a contemporary of prince @entity114 at the upper - crust school , is no slacker in the family stakes			0
his father , @entity118 , is a successful financier and former high sheriff of kent while his grandfather , @entity120 , married lady @entity121 , daughter of admiral sir @entity124 , who commanded the @entity126 ’s @entity125 at the @entity127 in the @entity128 and became the second governor - general of @entity130			0
@entity131 , his family ’s @entity133 estate , is an eminently respectable country retreat with more than 20 acres of farmland			0
but it can not even begin to compare with the @entity11 ’s @entity28 , which features as @entity29 in the @entity31 films			0
the castle is known as as the ‘ @entity140 ’ and @entity10 ’s family are regarded locally in @entity143 country as royalty			0
the family ’s wealth is conservatively put at around £ 300million and includes more than 100,000 acres of land as well as an estate in @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity99			0
a bright , well - mannered and well - meaning young man , @entity10 , who studied geography at university specialising in renewable energy , also recently set up in business and is poised to drill the first commercial geothermal well in @entity157			0
ex-boyfriend @entity4 found @entity6 ’s association with the @entity146 ‘ claustrophobic ’ his parents , @entity25 , the 12th @entity11 , and gardening - obsessive mother @entity26 are sensible sorts and withheld the bulk of his inheritance to prevent him going off the rails			1
the couple are on ‘ kissing terms ’ with most members of the royal family ( including the @entity168 ) and they and their four children were all invited to prince @entity114 ’s april wedding			0
for her part @entity6 was said to be ‘ supremely at home ’ when she attended the wedding of their eldest , daughter , @entity173 at @entity175 wonder that @entity4 found @entity6 ’s association with the family a little ‘ claustrophobic ’ , according to one well - placed source			1
last week @entity180 reported they had finally spilt after 18 months together – just weeks after @entity6 was given the keys to @entity4 ’s @entity183 home			2
. according to the newspaper , @entity6 and @entity4 , a former professional cricketer who works as a financial analyst at brewing giant @entity186 in @entity187 , are now ‘ barely speaking ’			1
‘ she and @entity4 split briefly in the summer – but this time it ’s over , ’ a source said			0
the paper claimed that @entity4 , who is intensely private , felt uncomfortable with @entity6 ’s new found celebrity			2
friends have always expressed surprise at the relationship – ‘ @entity4 is very nice and steady and all that but he ’s just , well , a bit boring – particularly compared to @entity6 who is hugely outgoing , ’ one told the @entity197 only last month			1
friends say her next beau would need to be ‘ seriously sporty and well off ’			0
‘ and it would n’t hurt for them to have even a moderately respectable country pile , ’ said one			0
perhaps the @entity204 might yet boast double duchesses in the family ?			0

the pair have been confidantes since they shared a flat at @entity56
‘ i had noticed an attractive lady in the front row , but i did not realise it was her . she did look like @entity6 '
