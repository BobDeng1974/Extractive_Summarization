by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 21 march 2013 it is enough to make @entity2 break down and weep			0
while she wears her heart on her sleeve , it seems she is in a minority in modern fiction			0
new @entity11 books show significantly less emotion than they did a century ago , academics say			0
hankies at the ready ! @entity11 books published before the 1960s were far more emotional than their @entity17 counterparts academics analysed how frequently ‘ mood ’ words - those reflecting anger , disgust , fear , joy , sadness , surprise - were used in more than five million books published between 1900 to 2000			1
according to lead researcher dr @entity31 from the @entity32 , the average book published at the start of the 20th century has 14 per cent more emotional content than a novel from the end			2
‘ our main point was to show that we can detect this trend - that use of emotional content changes over time , ’ said dr @entity31 , a @entity37 in the @entity38			1
‘ the average 1900 book is 1.14 times more emotional than the average book in 2000			0
this means that if a book had 1000 emotional words in 1900 , now it will have 877 emotional words			0
’ modern day books have far less passion in them , and researchers say people fear ridicule for showing emotion speaking about the research author @entity56 said : ‘ people are unsure how to express emotions now			1
they think it is a bit wet going over the top , and maybe people fear ridicule			0
there is certainly less conviction and passion in modern books			0
‘ my books are very full of joy , they are like a knickerbocker glory of love			2
’ the research , published in the journal @entity74 , found that as well as general decrease in emotions , the use of positive or negative mood words seemed to reflect historical events			1
author @entity56 says her books are ' a knickerbocker glory of love ' there were two happy peaks where greater ‘ joy ’ words were used in books - those published after the @entity88 and in the 1960s			1
in contrast , researchers found a sad peak corresponding to the @entity93			1
‘ we were initially surprised to see how well periods of positive and negative moods correlated with historical events , ’ said dr @entity31			0
‘ @entity93 , for example , is marked by a distinct increase in words related to sadness , and a correspondent decrease in words related to joy			1
’ until the middle of the last century , @entity11 writers used slightly more emotional language than their @entity17 counterparts			1
but the study found that since the 1960s there has been a divergence in style , with @entity17 books becoming decidedly more emotional , a possible reflection of the differing fortunes of the ‘ baby boomer ’ generation on each side of the @entity118			1
the same divergence was also found in the use of content - free words , which are words that carry little or no meaning on their own like conjunctions such as ‘ and ’ or ‘ but ’ , and articles such as ‘ the ’			1
‘ this is particularly fascinating because it has recently been shown that differences in usage of content - free words are a signature of different stylistic periods in the history of western literature , ’ said dr @entity31			2
the divergence in emotional content between the two forms of @entity139 suggests a more general stylistic divide			0
co-author professor @entity141 said : ‘ we do n’t know exactly what happened in the @entity144 but our results show that this is the precise moment in which literary @entity17 and @entity11 @entity139 started to diverge			2
we can only speculate whether this was connected , for example , to the baby - boom or to the rising of counterculture			0
‘ in the @entity17 , baby boomers grew up in the greatest period of economic prosperity of the century , whereas the @entity11 baby boomers grew up in a post-war recovery period so perhaps ‘ emotionalism ’ was a luxury of economic growth			2
’ the study also recorded an increased occurrence of anxiety and paranoia in our literature , with the average book in 2000 possession 12 per cent more words indicating fear than a 1960 publication .			0
