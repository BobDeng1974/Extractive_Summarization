by @entity0 for @entity1 tap water in some parts of @entity5 contains high levels of fluoride that could be lowering resident 's iq , it has been claimed			1
residents in the @entity12 area rely on private wells			1
however , a new study found that in 10 communities in the state have wells that have dangerously high levels of fluoride			1
a recent @entity19 study showed where the highest concentrations of fluoride were			0
now studies in @entity5 said the supply there could be twice the recommended amount			0
in @entity12 , data from 37 wells indicates that 37.8 percent of that water is above the state â€™s maximum exposure guideline for fluoride			1
in @entity39 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , more than 10 percent of the wells appear to have fluoride levels higher than the state cutoff			1
the new data on fluoride levels in @entity5 water comes from homeowners who voluntarily sent water samples into state labs for testing , according to @entity49			1
in some cases , the wells contain more than double the level that the @entity53 @entity52 has deemed the acceptable maximum exposure level			2
a 2012 review article by @entity56 examined several studies performed outside the @entity53 and found that high fluoride exposures reduce children 's iqs by an average of about seven points			1
@entity56 researchers ' review of fluoride / brain studies concludes ' our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children 's neurodevelopment			2
' it was published in @entity74 , a @entity53 @entity76 ' journal			0
' the children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower iq than those who lived in low fluoride areas , ' write @entity82 et al			1
experts say those in @entity5 are drinking similar levels			0
' the sort of levels we 're talking about that are high in @entity89 are the sort of levels we see in some private wells , ' says @entity93 , @entity5 state toxicologist , told @entity49			2
further , the @entity52 says fluoride is a chemical ' with substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity			0
' fluoride ( fluosilicic acid ) is added to @entity53 water supplies at approximately 1 part per million attempting to reduce tooth decay			0
after reviewing fluoride toxicological data , the @entity103 reported in 2006 , ' it 's apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain			0
' @entity82 's team wrote , ' fluoride readily crosses the placenta			0
' fluoride exposure to the developing brain , which is much more susceptible to injury caused by toxicants than is the mature brain , may possibly lead to damage of a permanent nature			0
' however , earlier this a new study by researchers from the @entity122 in @entity123 claimed fluoride does not lower iq levels			1
drawing data from a large study of 1,000 people born in @entity129 in @entity123 during 1972 - 1973 - the @entity130 study - researchers from the @entity122 compared the @entity131 of study participants who grew up in suburbs with and without fluoridated water			0
they say the results showed ' no significant differences in iq by fluoride exposure			2

previous studies have linked fluoride with a lower iq
state wells in @entity12 and other areas found to have double safe levels
