by @entity0 and @entity1 a campaign by hardline @entity3 to take control of state schools was laid bare yesterday			0
revealing the shocking extent to which strict @entity3 practices are being imposed on pupils and teachers alike , the chief inspector of schools said the plotters used ‘ fear and intimidation ’ against their opponents			1
sir @entity16 said the aim of the ‘ @entity19 ’ campaign was to impose a ‘ narrow faith - based ideology ’ on schools in @entity21			1
one primary spent £ 32,000 on a five - star trip to @entity43 from which @entity45 pupils were barred			1
children as young as six at the same school were told that @entity50 women were ‘ white prostitutes ’			1
launching long - awaited reports on 21 schools , sir @entity16 said the widespread conspiracy had involved fundamentalists infiltrating governing bodies			1
centre of scandal : @entity29 was downgraded from ' outstanding ' to ' inadequate ' governors had ‘ exerted inappropriate influence ’ on schools leading to enforced segregation of boys and girls in some classes and a narrowing of the curriculum			1
the @entity69 reports – and a separate set of @entity72 investigations – make many other revelations including that teachers attempted to vet the script of a nativity play			0
the reports were issued as : involved : the @entity79 and @entity80 were both branded ' inadequate ' as a result of the inspections @entity83 needed : governors at @entity85 were accused of ' refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis ' while governors at @entity89 used the school 's budget to subsidise a trip to @entity43 sir @entity16 revealed that mr @entity94 had blocked his request for the right to carry out snap inspections			1
@entity69 ’s three - month inquiry resulted in five schools being put into special measures , with a sixth having its ‘ failing ’ verdict reaffirmed			2
eleven other schools were found to ‘ require improvement ’ while one was rated good and a further three outstanding			0
in an advice note to mr @entity94 , sir @entity16 warned that in some schools , heads had been forced out by bullying governors			1
opposed : @entity111 - alleged ring - leader in the so - called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools - has described the allegations as ' a witch - hunt ' failings : the practices of @entity119 , the chairman of governors at @entity122 , and @entity123 , chair of governors at the @entity124 , have also been questioned by the report one head was so worried about the consequences of whistle - blowing he or she insisted on meeting inspectors in a supermarket car park			1
‘ some headteachers reported that there has been an organised campaign to target certain schools in @entity21 in order to alter their character and ethos , ’ sir @entity16 said			2
‘ a culture of fear and intimidation has developed in some of the schools since their previous inspection			0
‘ @entity143 and some head teachers variously described feeling “ intimidated ” , “ undermined ” or “ bullied ” by governors , and sometimes by senior staff , into making changes they did not support			1
’ some governors were ‘ trying to impose and promote a narrow faith - based ideology in what are non-faith schools ’			1
sir @entity16 suggested the governors were part of a network , noting that ‘ some of these governors serve on several schools ’			2
headteachers had ‘ identified governors who are highly influential across several of the schools that were inspected ’			2
claims of a co-ordinated campaign initially surfaced in the letter that triggered the @entity69 and @entity165 investigations , which purported to describe a ‘ @entity19 ’ operation to infiltrate governing bodies and push through a strict @entity3 agenda			2
sir @entity16 last night piled further pressure on mr @entity94 over his handling of the extremism threat with the disclosure that he asked for the ability to carry out snap inspections two years ago but was blocked by the @entity175			2
the claim , in a @entity178 interview , came hours after mr @entity94 announced a wide - ranging inquiry into the way his department dealt with warnings of extremist influence on schools in a bid to calm a damaging @entity187 row over the issue			1
@entity189 , of teaching union @entity190 , said : ‘ we should take comfort in the willingness of staff to resist intimidation and put their careers on the line to protect their students			0
‘ the reports reveal weaknesses in oversight , governance and support			0
they show that staff with concerns did not know where to turn			0
’ governors at three schools rated inadequate have hit back at @entity69 ’s findings , claiming they were a product of an ‘ islamophobic witch - hunt ’			1
speaking on behalf of @entity214 , vice-chairman @entity213 said that its three schools – @entity217 , @entity79 and @entity80 – were wrongly rated inadequate and had no links to extremism			0
he said the schools ‘ wholeheartedly ’ rejected @entity69 ’s findings and said they would launch a legal challenge			2
@entity223 , assistant principal at @entity29 , insisted the schools were free from strict @entity3 practices			0
@entity213 , the vice chair of @entity226 at the centre of the scandal , this morning furiously rejected @entity69 's findings and vowed to fight the decision to put his schools in special measures ‘ it is simply not true that the school does not do enough to protect our pupils from the risks of extremism , ’ he said			1
under pressure : @entity239 the deputy head at @entity122 ‘ this is a normal state school like thousands of others across @entity243 , 98 per cent of our pupils just happen to be @entity245 – @entity245			1
’ in a letter to @entity69 chief sir @entity16 , the trust said criticism of @entity29 was ‘ laced with islamophobic sentiment ’ and asked for a re-inspection of the schools ‘ under a climate that is far removed from the fallacious insinuations of radical and extremist plots that have provided the context for the current set of inspections ’			0
trust chairman @entity111 – alleged ring - leader in the so - called plot to enforce a hardline agenda at the schools – has described the allegations as ‘ a witch - hunt ’			1
but a group of female pupils at @entity29 backed @entity69 ’s findings , saying yesterday : ‘ our school deserves this ... for the things that it has done			0
‘ our school is too extreme but not in a terrorist way			0
they are strict with us and they use religion as an excuse			0
basically they do n’t let boys and girls mix. ‘ if they see you talking to a boy they will call your parents or come to your house , which they did to a lot of people			0
’ the teenage girls , who did n’t want to be identified , told @entity284 that pupils were afraid to speak out about the school			2
