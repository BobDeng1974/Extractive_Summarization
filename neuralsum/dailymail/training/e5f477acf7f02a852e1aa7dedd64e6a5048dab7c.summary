@entity1 's cities risk being ' cast aside ' and the poor left behind by politicians obsessed with trying to woo @entity4 , the @entity5 warned today			1
the archbishop of york dr @entity6 warned ' rampant consumerism and individualism ' have acted to eradicate the glue that holds communities together			2
and the archbishop of @entity13 claimed that whole towns and regions are trapped in a spiral of economic decline			1
in a strongly - worded attack on the coalition timed for the start of the election build - up , the @entity31 @entity30 blamed spending cuts and the failure of government to do enough to support recovery in the regions			1
in his contribution to the book , titled on rock or @entity44 , the dr @entity30 said : ‘ our economy appears to be , in one sense , a tale of two cities – one being a growing and constantly improving @entity51 and the @entity52 generally , and the other being most , but not all , other cities , alike in that they are each trapped in apparently inevitable decline			2
’ he said spending cuts have widened the gap and added : ‘ the hard truth is that many of these cities are in what appear to be lose - lose situations			1
‘ already in decline , the road towards recovery and growth is made even more difficult			2
' there are now fewer readily available @entity67 resources able to support economic development in these regions ; and also , since the 1980s , the banking system has become more and more @entity51 concentrated and consequently out of touch with local needs			2
' dr @entity6 's book claims the poor have been ‘ left behind ’ , entire cities have been ‘ cast aside ’ , and that inequality between rich and poor is ‘ evil ’			1
the book amounts to a direct challenge to the prime minister and the @entity81			0
it compares itself to the notorious 1985 @entity84 report , which condemned @entity86 ’s government and was in turn dismissed by one of her ministers as ‘ @entity91 ’			0
in an interview to launch the book , dr @entity6 told @entity94 : ‘ that sounds extremely left - wing does n’t it ? the truth is it is the theology of where i am coming from			0
' this marrying of justice and self - interest is deeply unfashionable in a political scene where parties rush to outdo each other in enticing and beguiling the swing vote of middle @entity106 not with a vision of justice but with appeals to individual preference , interest and consumer choice			0
” he added : while many have benefited from the economic progress of past decades , the consequences of this rampant consumerism and individualism – both economic and social – have been to eradicate the glue that holds communities together			0
“ astonishingly , this disintegrative process is then expressed in what it means to live a good life			0
” the archbishop of @entity13 , the most rev @entity30 , said some towns are trapped in a spiral of economic decline due to government spending cuts			1
work and pensions secretary @entity130 dismissed the comments as ‘ unbalanced and unfair ’ dr @entity30 ’s contribution to the book said : ‘ there is a general social assumption that the economy has the power to dictate what is and is not possible for human beings			1
' we believe that if we can fix the economy , the fixing of human beings will automatically follow			0
‘ it is a lie because it is a narrative that casts money , rather than humanity , as the protagonist of @entity150 ’s story			0
