a baby bird in @entity1 has made history after becoming the world ’s first penguin to be conceived using artificial insemination			1
the unnamed female @entity7 penguin was hatched in may at @entity1 after sperm was frozen and then thawed			1
the 12 - week - old penguin was hand - reared at the attraction ’s @entity11 nursery , but is now feeding on fish			1
although she does n't have an official name , she is referred to as 184			1
she was conceived using frozen semen that had been thawed , and is now 12 weeks old although she does n't have an official name , she is referred to as 184			1
she has now joined other @entity22 penguin chicks that were conceived naturally at the attraction			1
magellanic penguins are typically found around the @entity25 and @entity26			2
they are also known as jackass penguins			2
their name comes from the @entity31 in @entity26			0
they grow to around 27 inches ( 70cm ) , and have an average weight of 8.8lbs ( 4kg )			0
in the wild , adults begin the breeding process in september , by building a nest , before laying an egg in mid october			0
incubation takes around 40 days			0
when the chick is 30 days old , they should have developed their plumage , and are encouraged to leave the nest			0
there are said to be around 1.8 million breeding pairs of @entity47 penguins around the world			0
researchers are hoping to use these artificial insemination techniques to increase the genetic diversity of penguin species , and learn more about their biology			1
this research could then be used to sustain , or improve , penguin populations around the world			2
after the bird hatched , she was fed a special formula of ground herring fillets , krill , minerals , vitamins and water five times a day during the first four weeks			1
the scientific first is the result of a decade of research by dr. @entity69 , @entity71 ’s vice president of theriogenology , and dr. @entity72 , the reproductive centre ’s scientific director			0
dr. @entity72 said : ‘ the goal of our research centre is to study a species ’ reproductive biology , to learn as much as we can about that , and use this to not only monitor the health of not only our zoological populations but wild populations as well			2
researchers are hoping to use these artificial insemination techniques ( pictured ) to increase the genetic diversity of penguin species , and learn more about their biology			1
this research could then be used to sustain , or improve , penguin populations around the world ‘ we have also use this information to develop system reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and semen preservation			1
‘ these technologies are important conservation tools as they allow us to maximise the genetic diversity of these populations and ensure there ’s sustainability into the long term			1
’ for more than 30 years , @entity101 has run a successful penguin breeding program			2
since 1980 , more than 600 penguin chicks have been hatched and raised at the marine park , including the first - ever chinstrap and emperor penguins			1
after the bird hatched , she was fed a special formula of ground herring fillets , krill , minerals , vitamins and water five times a day during the first four weeks			2
she has now joined other @entity22 penguins in the park ( pictured )			0
since 1980 , more than 600 penguin chicks have been hatched and raised at the attraction the scientific first is the result of a decade of research by dr. @entity69 , @entity71 ’s vice president of theriogenology , and dr. @entity72 , ( pictured with @entity22 chicks ) the reproductive centre ’s scientific director @entity71 uses both natural breeding and assisted reproductive technologies within this program to maintain genetically diverse and sustainable populations , in cooperation with other zoos			1
