the popular @entity8 @entity7 dipped inside defending @entity10 champion @entity9 on a restart with three laps to go and cruised from there under the yellow caution flag			1
he flipped up his visor to wipe tears from his eyes as the crowd roared and then poured the celebratory winner 's milk over his head in @entity22			2

milking it ! @entity7 , of @entity8 , celebrates with the traditional pouring of the winner 's milk after winning the @entity3 in @entity26 on sunday ' i have to say , the last lap was the longest lap of my life , ' @entity7 said			1
' i got a little bit of luck today			2
i was looking at the stands , and it was unbelievable			2
this is it , man			2
' it means a lot to because so many people , i could feel that they wanted me to win , and it 's such a selfish thing to do because what are they getting from it ? i 'm the one who gets the trophy			2
' and if you can bring some joy to them and i think the best thing was trying to put an exciting race for them			1
and i said it before the race , i believed that this win was more for people out there than for me			1
' @entity7 had his fair share of chances to win at @entity26 but came up short time and time again			1
he was leading when the rain came in 2007 , only to lose to @entity66 when the race resumed			1

he had a pair of third - place finishes , including last year , again to @entity66			2
the indy 500 tradition of pouring a jug of milk over the champion 's head started in 1936 when winning driver @entity94 asked for a glass of buttermilk after the race			1
from the 1950s , milk companies put up the winner 's purse - and handed milk to the champion driver as part of the deal			2
today , the @entity104 pays $ 10,000 if the winner drinks dairy in @entity22			2
' i wanted it all my life , but over the years i was kind of ok with the fact that i may never have the chance to win , ' @entity7 said			1
' we can disprove the theory that nice guys do n't win			2
' this time , it was @entity66 whose crash brought out the final caution to seal @entity7 's victory			1
' it 's wonderful for him , ' said @entity121 , himself a victim of bad luck at @entity3			2
' he 's raced here long enough that he deserves it , no question			2
' the win for @entity7 and car owner @entity127 was celebrated throughout the paddock			1
@entity129 , who came from @entity130 to watch the race and gave @entity7 one of his 2012 @entity134 medals as good luck , wept behind the pit wall as @entity7 took the checkered flag			1
good luck charm : @entity7 kisses his wife @entity139 after winning the race celebration : the @entity8 driver celebrates by kissing the bricks after winning the @entity145 500 mile race ' i tell you i 'm starting to think ( the medal ) really works , ' said @entity129 , who lost his legs in a 2001 crash in @entity151			1
' it 's a dream come true to see @entity7 win , to see @entity127 win , my dear friend			1
i 'm so happy , i 'm so happy			2
' it was @entity127 who brought @entity129 's medal to @entity7 before the race , telling his driver that @entity129 wanted him to rub it for good luck			1
' i cuddled with it , ' @entity7 later admitted			1
fellow @entity8 @entity164 , shooting for a record - tying fourth @entity3 win , was happy for his long - time friend			1
' finally he 's able to win this race			1
he 's so close so many times , but the good news is the good old boys are still able to run fast , ' @entity164 said			2
@entity73 , a 21 - year - old rookie making his first @entity10 start , finished second and @entity9 was third			2
' @entity171 is such a fan favorite , absolutely , it 's great to see him win it			0
if anybody is going to win it in the field , he 's one of the few i 'd like to see other than myself , ' @entity9 said			0
' we were leading on that last restart , i knew i was a sitting duck , and i was n't too bummed about it because i knew we had enough laps to get it going again and have a pass back			0
maybe i would be third on the last lap , which is where i wanted to be			0
' got milk ? @entity7 toasts his victory on sunday by pouring the winner 's milk over his head , an old @entity3 tradition they 're off ! drivers start their engines in the 97th running of the historic race only there was n't a last lap as @entity66 brought out the caution seconds after the race went green			1
' i went into the first corner on the last restart and it just did n't turn and then hit			0
the big , old hit , ' said @entity66			0
' when i saw who was leading , it cheered me up a little bit			0
he 's a very , very deserving winner			0
' the leaders came to the finish line all bunched up around @entity7 , saluting the longtime @entity10 stalwart who had longed to add the final missing piece to his resume			1
that was about as slow as anyone had driven all day			0
the average speed was 187.433 mph , another @entity3 record			0
@entity221 finished fourth , failing to win for the eighth time , and @entity223 was fifth in the highest - finishing @entity224 on a day that was dominated by @entity69			0
pole - sitter @entity227 led a race - high 37 laps and finished 10th			1
for a time , it appeared the win would go to @entity233 , who led 23 laps in his indy 500 debut for @entity236			0
fired by @entity237 from his @entity239 ride last year after failing a @entity239 drug test , @entity237 gave him a second chance with this @entity10 opportunity			0
seven years after leaving open - wheel racing , @entity233 finally ran " @entity3 '' and was leading when his seat belt came undone , forcing him to pit			0
it put @entity233 off the pit cycle , and he was forced to stop for gas twice far in advance of the rest of the field			0
it meant @entity233 had to drive his way back to the front each time , and he finally sputtered out at seventh			0
' once i figured it out , it was phenomenal			0
i could drive by guys at will when i wanted to , ' @entity233 said			0
' i felt like we were up front running our own race , and , i do n't know , belts come undone			1
' i 'll be honest , pretty special moment to be leading at @entity3 , '' he said			0
" my body kind of went numb , my mind was racing and i could feel my heart beating really fast , and that 's a special moment i 'll never forget			0
' a year after 34 lead changes and a frantic finish created what many considered the best @entity3 ever , @entity10 had its hands full trying to top itself			0
this one might have done it , with the slicing and dicing at the front , over and over and over again			0
there were a record 68 lead changes by 14 drivers , and 28 of the 33 cars were running at the end			0
with 100 miles to go , 25 drivers were on the lead lap. ' it was a hell of a race			1
that 's all i can say , ' said @entity121			0
' this is riveting competition , that 's all i can tell you			0
the reliability of the cars is there			0
it 's unbelievable racing , the best i 've seen in years			0
