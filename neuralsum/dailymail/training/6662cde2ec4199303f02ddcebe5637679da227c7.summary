by @entity0 they have both been high - ranking @entity2 who have graced the covers of @entity5 over 40 times collectively			2
but 31 - year - old @entity7 and 21 - year - old @entity8 have both recently claimed they do n't identify themselves as models			1
' i never saw myself as a model , ' ms @entity7 , who has an estimated net worth of $ 20million , said recently to @entity15 's @entity14 , while @entity16 , worth a more modest $ 4million , told into the gloss : ' i have never considered modelling an actual job title			1
' not models ? @entity7 ( left ) may be worth an estimated $ 40million , and @entity8 ( right ) around $ 4million , but both successful supermodels are reluctant to identify themselves as such and while most people would define their jobs as the thing they get paid to do - extremely lucratively in the case of these two professional beautiful people - it is true that these days , both can count themselves as established entrepreneurs too			1
' if someone asks me what i do , i say , " i have my own skincare line			1
" i do n’t define myself as a model , ' ms @entity7 says , in reference to her highly successful skincare care , @entity36 , which she launched in 2009			1
' i like being able to find different aspects of myself ... it 's fun			0
i might as well do it while i can			0
it 's not going to last forever			0
' walking advert : ms @entity7 mists herself with a product from her successful @entity36 skincare range ( pictured ) , just one of her many entrepreneurial pursuits outside of modeling branching out : the @entity48 model ended her contract as a @entity50 ( left ) last year to focus on other projects , such as the single she recently released ; a cover of @entity56 's you 're @entity57 ( right ) and @entity36 is far from the only pie she has her perfectly manicured finger in			1
last year , the newly single mother - of - one hung up her @entity62 wings to pursue a wide range of different business ventures , and to focus more on being a mother			2
' the thing is , i 've been modeling since i was 13			0
i 'm now entering a new phase in my life			0
i have felt this coming since my son was born and , after i became a mother , i realized i needed to prioritize my time , ' the @entity48 - born supermodel told the @entity75			2
' if someone asks me what i do , i say , " i have my own skincare line			1
" i do n’t define myself as a model ' as well as being ranked second in @entity82 ' 2013 list of the world 's highest - paid models - @entity80 taking the top spot - ms @entity7 recently released her second second - help book aimed at young women , entitled @entity88 , last month launched her first music single ; a cover of @entity56 's you 're @entity57 , and has graced the covers of @entity14 , @entity93 , and @entity95 magazine all in the last few weeks			1
not just a pretty face : miss @entity8 recently took part in a week - long program at the @entity99 ( pictured ) , with the aim of getting more involved in the successful running of a company multi-talented : one of @entity50 's newest @entity2 ( left ) , miss @entity8 has been pounding the catwalk since she was 13 years old , and has a gluten - free baking company called @entity8 's @entity105 ( right ) as for @entity16 , a @entity106 - born former trained ballet dancer , she has this definition on how she earns her bread : ' i treat myself more as an athlete than just a model			1
i love to challenge myself physically and mentally			0
' but i 'm not a professional athlete , i 'm not a professional dancer , i 'm not a professional anything ; i have never considered modelling an actual job title			0
i have yet to determine what my job actually is but , yeah , modelling is a fun and funny gig			0
' miss @entity8 , who , much like ms @entity7 , kicked off her modeling career when she was only 13 , seems to have set her eyes on a different prize of late			1
tough cookie : miss @entity8 ( pictured ) was a trained ballet dancer before she got into the fashion business , and says she treats herself more like an ' athlete ' than a model dedicated : ms @entity7 is a long - time yoga fan , and regularly loops her practice into her affiliations with brands , including @entity132 ( pictured ) , @entity36 , and @entity15 , to name a few last month , miss @entity8 attended the @entity99 for a short course in @entity135			1
speaking to @entity136 , she said : ' i feel fortunate to have an incredible career but there is so much more that i want to do with my life			0
' now that i am getting more and more involved in these entrepreneurial projects i think business is something that would also be fascinating			0
' i have never considered modelling an actual job title			0
i have yet to determine what my job actually is but , yeah , modelling is a fun and funny gig ' ' to have a better understanding of economics and business , and the way to run a successful company			0
' proving her business acumen , she launched a gluten - free cookie product called @entity105 at @entity157 two years ago , in collaboration with popular @entity160 bakery @entity159			1
miss @entity8 , who is a relationship with investment mogul @entity162 , has recently teamed up with @entity163 to collaborate on a collection of sunglasses			2
and the energetic model recently showed up at the @entity167 run by the @entity168 , where she attended a panel on the topic of formulating social solutions to global issues			2
still , while both @entity16 and ms @entity7 may be stretching their wings way past the realms of catwalk , it seems unlikely that either will be permanently leaving their undeniable posts as ' models ' any time soon .			2

@entity7 would rather be recognized for her skincare line , @entity36
@entity8 has her own range of gluten - free cookies and recently attended a @entity99 course
