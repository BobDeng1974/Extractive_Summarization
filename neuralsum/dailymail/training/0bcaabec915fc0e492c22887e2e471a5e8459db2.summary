by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 24 march 2013 an illegal website is selling more than £ 1million worth of drugs every single month - with many of the banned substances being posted to buyers in the @entity6			1
visitors to the virtually untraceable ' @entity9 ' website can buy ecstasy , heroin , cannabis and cocaine which is then disguised as a normal packaged parcel by the seller and sent through the post			1
the website has been shrouded in secrecy since its launch in february 2011 but research tracking its growth in 2012 will be officially published later this year			1
it shows that sales on the site doubled over a six - month period in 2012 reaching $ 1.7million sales - the equivalent of £ 1million - every single month			1
scheme : the @entity9 drug dealing website is set up like an online store , allowing customers to find the drugs they want at the best price and to give feed back on the sellers illegal : @entity9 - a website known as the @entity36 for drugs - allows people to buy drugs like this block cannabis online and have it sent to them by post dr @entity43 , who conducted the research , said ' @entity9 ' continues to grow and is extremely difficult to ban			1
he told @entity45 : ' it 's not a matter of police locking a few guys up to end this			2
it is very distributed - we are looking at more than 600 sellers each month			1
' @entity9 operates as an illegal replica of online marketplaces like @entity36 and @entity56 , with buyers and sellers , dispute and resolution services and feedback ratings			1
the website is accessed via a programme called @entity64 which enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an ' onion ' system to make sure their ip address is always hidden from police			1
@entity64 is free software and an open network that makes identifying the physical location of the computers operating the marketplace – or anyone visiting it – all but impossible			2
it protects internet users against a form of network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis			0
dangerous : this cannabis was being sold but users say it is easier and safer than buying off a street dealer brazen : this cocaine was also for sale on @entity9 which is using complicated software to allow people to buy and sell anonymously the legitimate uses of @entity64 make disrupting the service morally difficult for police as it is used all over the world by activists who would otherwise be censored or persecuted in their home countries such as @entity98 and @entity99			1
@entity64 is a popular internet anonymising tool which can be downloaded for free from the web			0
it enables all members to remain anonymous online and uses an ' onion ' system to make sure ip addresses - each computer has its own one - are always hidden from police			0
it makes identifying the physical location of the computers using the software all but impossible			2
@entity64 only protects users from being monitored on applications that are properly configured to send their internet traffic through the programme unless individuals also use it as a browser instead of @entity122 or internet explorer			0
as well as protecting users from being tracked by police , it also means they are protected from network surveillance and state security known as traffic analysis			0
this makes interference with the website difficult on morality grounds as it is used by activists trapped in countries with oppressive regimes to communicate without being tracked by governments			1
prime examples are human rights groups in @entity98 and @entity99 which would otherwise be censored or even persecuted for expressing their views			0
a large proportion of @entity64 's funding comes indirectly from the @entity146 state department 's internet freedom budget			0

users claim the website is a much safer alternative than meeting drug dealers on the streets			2
drugs are bought with ‘ @entity163 ’ , an untraceable digital currency			2
it is not regulated by any government or company but just by mathematical equations			0
the value is worked out by how many @entity163 are in existence and how many are being traded			0
another knock - on effect of sites such as @entity9 is that the value of a ' @entity163 ' have gone from being virtually worthless to trading at $ 70 - around £ 46 - each			1
a @entity163 developer @entity174 denies that the currency is mainly used for illegal purposes			0
he told the newspaper : ' people want drugs			1
the drugs war is probably a failed war			2
i want to get rid of cartels			0
the way to do that is for people to buy products straight from the producer			2
that 's what 's cool about things like @entity9 - you can bypass gangs			1
' @entity195 @entity194 reportedly used @entity9 to buy and import @entity196 , amphetamine , marijuana and cocaine on 11 different occasions			1
but @entity202 officers in @entity203 and @entity204 examined mail - most of which came from the @entity206 and @entity207 - destined for his home			0
they found 46.9 grammes of @entity196 and 14.5 grammes of cocaine , according to wired.co.uk			0
the federal police then raided his house in july 2012 and found digital scales , ziplock bags , $ 2,300 ( £ 2,000 ) in cash , 35 stun guns disguised as mobile phones and a money counter			2
@entity194 pleaded guilty to two charges of ' importing a marketable quantity of a border - controlled drug '			0
amphetamine : this seller has piles of speed for sale , which is being sent by post and landing on the nation 's doorsteps killer : drugs like this @entity233 displayed on @entity9 is being sent all over the world by dealers			1
