@entity0 , matriarch of the conservative @entity2 stars of @entity3 ’s @entity0 , has an older sister who is a lesbian with a long - term partner who says she worries about the reality star ’s chosen lifestyle			1
the relationship between @entity0 ’s sister and her partner has never been mentioned by the @entity0 - who are quite open about their intolerance toward homosexuality - in their hit show			1
in november the @entity0 deleted photos of same - sex couples kissing from their official @entity20 page after they had asked people to share photos , meanwhile oldest son @entity16 recently led an @entity24 rally protesting against gay marriage			2
just as the @entity0 have issues with homosexuals so too @entity0 ’s family have concerns over her unusual lifestyle choices and extreme @entity2 beliefs			2
speaking to @entity40 in 2010 , @entity32 described herself as a ‘ significant other ’ of @entity27 and revealed the couple ’s concerns about the @entity36 ’s ties to the @entity46 movement			1
‘ we are worried about them , ’ @entity32 said			0
‘ we have often thought that @entity46 is a cult			2
it appears to be brainwashing to me			0
’ @entity46 is a movement among some conservative evangelical @entity54 couples that promotes procreation , eschews all forms of birth control and sees children as a blessing from @entity61			1
@entity27 featured in a early episode of the reality show when the @entity65 family had a get together with @entity0 's siblings and her father			1
@entity30 was n't featured or even mentioned in the episode			1
@entity0 ’s sibling @entity27 , above , lives with her partner @entity30 , 52 , in @entity31 , @entity70 big love : the @entity65 family is a part of an evangelical @entity2 movement that urges women to have as many children as @entity61 gives them @entity27 and her girlfriend are n’t the only members of the @entity65 ’s extended family whose lifestyle is at odds with their ultra-conservative family values			1
@entity82 , a sister of @entity65 ’s wife @entity83 , is reported to have had a child outside of wedlock			1
@entity16 , the eldest @entity65 son , moved from @entity24 to @entity87 a year and a half ago to work for the conservative lobbying group the @entity88 , where he is an executive director			0
the @entity0 ’ conservative christian values and close - knit family has made 19 kids and counting one of @entity3 ’s most successful shows			2
but accusations of gay ‘ fear - mongering ’ appeared to threaten the reality show ’s future in november , when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by @entity0			1
in august the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation			0
her voice was used in a robocall message sent to @entity112 , @entity24 , residents that asked them to vote against the ordinance that would protect members of the gay and transgender communities			0
fallout : the @entity0 matriach and her husband @entity121 could see their hit reality series axed if petition organizers get their way @entity27 appeared in one episode of 19 kids and counting where @entity0 visited her @entity27 relatives , but for the most part she has n’t been featured on the show she said : ' i do n’t believe the citizens of @entity112 would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls			1
' the series had returned for ninth season in september			0
the political move prompted a petition on @entity145 launched by @entity146 to axe the show after hearing @entity65 's words that he said ' reek of ignorance and fear mongering			1
' he wrote on the petition page : ' just because someone is transgendered does n't mean they are a child predator or a rapist			0
the claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women 's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear - mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred			0
' supports of the @entity0 have launched a rival petition to keep the show on tv , which raised over 12,000 votes			2
' many that may or may not agree with their personal beliefs , but this does not mean that they should n't be allowed their reality show or that they should be attacked for their personal beliefs , ' the organizer wrote			2
