by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 01:51 est , 23 august 2012 two terraced houses have partially collapsed after scrap metal thieves broke into them and stole their cast iron window frames			1
emergency services sealed off the properties after neighbours reported hearing ' rumbling noises ' and found rubble and debris on the pavement			1
witnesses suggested that the stolen metal would only have been worth about £ 20 , but the damage to the buildings in @entity17 , @entity18 , is much more costly			1
damaged : debris and rubble lie on the pavement outside two homes in @entity17 , @entity18 , which were targeted by scrap metal thieves as well as taking out the window frames , which had been installed so the properties could be boarded up , the thieves removed stonework , making the buildings structurally unsafe			1
the thefts were today being investigated by @entity30			2
neighbour @entity31 , 25 , said the area was often targeted by thieves hoping to steal copper and lead			1
describing the moment the window frames were taken , he added : ' i heard a bang and saw someone run out of the window and then the house started collapsing			1
' the fire engines and police came and cordoned it all off			2
i think they must have been getting the copper and pipes , the fireplace is still inside though			1
crime scene : thieves caused this damage to the properties as they stole cast iron window frames ' they were meant to be knocking all this area down but we ’ve not heard anything since			1
' it used to be a really nice area when my grandparents moved her thirty years ago			1
now it ’s just a hell hole			2
' @entity64 , 73 , who lives near the damaged houses , said the thieves struck at about 9pm on monday			1
' i was just sat in the living room and i saw flashing lights and so i went outside and saw two fire engines and a police car , he said			0
' i went down and saw all the debris			0
' they were going for the cast iron windows			0
they must have got in through the inside and were trying to knock it out			0
' it would have been a hefty job - even though the house was in a bad state anyway			0
' it ’s the metal thieves who are dragging this place down			1
' builder @entity86 , 45 , said : ' a lot of these houses are just boarded up now and it ’s leading to criminal damage			0
out of bounds : the empty properties in @entity17 , @entity18 , which had been boarded up , were cordoned off by emergency services ' the thieves would have been lucky to get only got £ 20 for that scrap iron , it ’s not worth it			1
in fact they ’d be lucky to get that			0
' scrap is good money overall but it is the damage afterwards which people are left with			0
' another neighbour , @entity104 , 48 , said : ' there has been a lot of people roaming around and i ’ve seen them stealing concrete slabs			2
' these houses want knocking down before the scrap thieves pull it down themselves			2
' firefighter @entity112 said three fire crews attended the incident , and warned that such crimes ' drained ' the emergency services ' valuable resources			0
' the fronts of the houses started to collapse due to thieves taking out the cast iron window sets , ' he said			1
' they had completely removed one and one was left hanging out			2
' he added : ' this was a major drain on resources with three appliances attending			0
how the street used to look : the house on the left of this photograph was one of the properties targeted by the thieves			1
the picture , taken before the raid , gives an indication of the scale of the damage that the criminals caused ' we are used to attending unoccupied homes that have been targeted by thieves but this was a new level for us			1
' they have endangered their own lives and the lives of others			0
' it is ridiculous they are prepared to risk so much for what seems so little			0
' @entity153 said it was trying to contact the owners of the properties			2
the authority 's leader , @entity156 , said : ' it is amazing the lengths people will go to steal items like this			0
' it is a growing issue and one that has been on my radar for a while			0
' when the shadow home secretary visited in april we went to some @entity170 properties that had pipes , radiators , and everything ripped out for metal thefts			2
' it is growing on a grand scale , and i think it will continue to do so until we have some proper controls over scrap dealers			0
' if they could n’t take cash payments then there would n’t be as big a market for this kind of thing			0

*residents* heard ' rumbling noises ' after criminals targeted the properties in @entity17 , @entity18
the thieves took out the window frames but also removed stonework , making the properties structurally unsound
@entity197 say the area has been targeted *regularly* by thieves stealing copper and lead
