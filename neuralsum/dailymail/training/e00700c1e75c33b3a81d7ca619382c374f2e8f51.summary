the energy he brings and his defence are excellent and his kicking game has been a big plus for us game in this @entity34			1
@entity17 ( left ) will start on the wing for @entity6 in place of @entity20 as they travel to @entity9 for sunday 's @entity34 clash it will be the @entity40 star 's ( centre ) first cap since making his five previous test appearances during last year 's @entity34 @entity17 will be joined in the backs by @entity11 full back @entity1 for the trip to the @entity46 @entity1 slots in after @entity3 was ruled out with the concussion he sustained against @entity16 @entity6 captain @entity49 runs with the ball during the session at @entity52 @entity6 head coach @entity0 ( centre right ) has praised the form of both @entity17 and @entity1 ‘ but @entity1 is a more than able replacement			1
he ’s been in excellent form for @entity11			2
he played in this game two years ago and he brings a lot to the party			2
’ @entity17 ’s return for his sixth cap has been widely expected after may struggled in @entity6 ’s opening wins over @entity63 and @entity16			1
the @entity65 winger scored one of the finest tries seen at @entity68 against @entity69 in november , but he wasted a three - on - one overlap against @entity16 and his defence has long been a source of concern			2

‘ his consistency edged him over @entity20 in this game			0
@entity1 and @entity17 work on the pads as they joined up with the squad on friday morning flyhalf @entity81 keeps his eye on the ball during a passing drill at their @entity86 base @entity89 's clutches await the ball as the team were put through their paces ahead of sunday 's game against @entity9 ‘ international rugby is about taking chasing and pulling together an international performance i think @entity20 will return a better player			1
look at @entity89 in the autumn			0
’ in the third and final adjustment to the match - day 23 , tighthead prop @entity100 is withdrawn from the bench after failing to recover from a hip flexor strain , giving @entity105 his first chance of the championship			1

the @entity6 team looked united as they huddled for a team talk , watched on by coach @entity0 ( top ) @entity1 replaces @entity3 who has had concussion symptoms since being knocked out against @entity16 @entity3 ( left ) suffered the injury after an accidental clash of heads with @entity16 's @entity117 earlier this month ' they have nine @entity119 in their starting 15 , so they 're full of high - quality players and obviously well - coached , ' @entity0 continued in an interview with @entity122			1
' you can see that by the way their maul 's put together , their defensive system , their attacking threats , their kicking game			0
' when you 've got that club - country cohesion as well , the @entity133 connection that @entity134 [ @entity135 ] has , with @entity131 , i think that 's part of it as well			0
they 're a very good team , and playing great rugby at the moment			0
' it 's a big game for both teams			0
we 've had a great two weeks preparation , it 's a settled team , and we 've built on the back of the @entity16 game and the @entity63 game , and away from home third game in , it 's a big challenge			0
we 've got two home games to come , but we 'll look forward to this one first			0
