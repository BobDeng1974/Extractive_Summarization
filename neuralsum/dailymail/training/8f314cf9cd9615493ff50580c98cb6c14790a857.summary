it might be welcome news for your health this @entity3 , but getting a good deal on your festive shopping has been made that little bit tougher			0
further evidence emerged today that seasonal chocolate and biscuit boxes are falling in weight - as prices increase by up to 25 per cent			2
a study of nine @entity3 treats - including @entity13 and @entity14 - found they all weighed less than this time last year			1
compared : a box of @entity13 is up 24p but has fallen in weight by almost 100g , while @entity14 has gone down 40g - but now costs 13p more and the research for @entity20 by price comparison website @entity22 revealed five of the items had gone up in price			1
a box of @entity14 chocolates has gone down from 1kg in 2011 to 820g in 2013 and 780g this year - but now costs 13p ( 8 per cent ) more			1
similarly , a box of @entity29 's @entity13 chocolates has risen 24p ( 13 per cent ) in price , but fallen in weight by 70g compared to last year			1

@entity36 are down 30g but up 33p , while @entity37 are down 15g but still £ 1 ‘ shrinking products used to crop up occasionally , which is when they made the news			0

’ other products examined in the study included @entity47 ’s @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity37			0

the heroes and @entity36 have gone up in price , while the @entity37 are the same , and the @entity50 and @entity46 have dropped			0
industry experts say products have shrunk not because of government health pressure but to maintain price - often to keep within the £ 5 price tag			1
the prices of products were averaged across those at @entity60 , @entity37 , @entity61 's , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 - and include multibuy offers			2
@entity67 said it had dropped the price at which it sells @entity14 boxes to retailers by 5 per cent - but retailers had the choice to drop the sale price			1
and @entity29 owner @entity76 said ‘ a range of economic factors across the board ’ resulted in it decreasing the size of some products			2
the research follows a report in the @entity85 that cartons of festive treats had shrunk by up to 14.8 per cent in the last year			2
according to its study , the weight of a £ 4 box of family favourites @entity92 and @entity93 has plummeted from 540g to 460g			0
