by @entity0 published : 20:41 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 02:55 est , 6 december 2012 forget fad diets and soggy salads and think yourself thin			1
a study has shown that believing a meal was bigger than it actually was can curb appetite			1
one hundred men and women were shown either a large or small bowl of soup and then given it to eat			2
crucially , some soup was removed from or added to the bowl as they tucked in , without them realising it			2
hungry : forget the diet , losing weight might be as simple as thinking yourself thin immediately afterwards , those who ate the smaller portion felt more hungry			0
but after just two or three hours , the amount eaten had little effect on hunger			1
instead , those who believed they had eaten the big bowl of soup felt the most satisfied			1
this meant that if two people had each eaten a small bowl of soup , the one that had been initially given a large portion felt fewer hunger pangs			1
a day later , those who had been shown the large portion also rated soup as being more satiating			0
the study , published in the journal @entity42 adds to evidence that our memory of what we have eaten plays a key role in dampening appetite			1
@entity50 , for instance , might eat three or four meals one after the other without feeling full			0
@entity54 researcher @entity53 said : ‘ obesity remains a major public health concern			0
‘ therefore understanding controls of energy intake should be high priority			0
‘ this is showing that the amount of hunger we experience between meals is n’t a simple product of the amount or type of food that we actually consumed - there is some sort of psychology involved			0
professor @entity53 has previously shown that those who are distracted while eating are hungrier afterwards			0
he said : ‘ we have shown that if you distract someone when they eat , they have a poorer memory of that meal and also eat more at a subsequent meal			2
‘ generally speaking , it ’s perhaps important to have a good memory of what you have eaten			1
‘ one way of doing that is to make sure you do n’t eat in front of the tv or computer screen			0
