by @entity0 published : 21:17 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 6 november 2012 @entity2 and 9 year old daughter @entity1 from @entity3 when @entity2 ’s seven - year - old daughter sobbed herself to sleep every night for three months , it was clear something had to change			1
ever since she ’d started school , @entity1 had struggled with playground politics			0
issues that another child might shrug off , such as a bit of teasing or being excluded from a game , hit the sensitive little girl very hard			0
her mother tried every strategy to boost @entity1 ’s confidence , but the situation just got worse			0
‘ we got to the point where every night after school she was distraught			1
eventually , i was crying myself to sleep at night , too , ’ says @entity2 , 41			1
desperate for a solution , @entity2 , scanned online parenting forums for advice			1
it was there she learned about life coaches for children			1
life coaches used to be viewed as rather ‘ new age ’ — counsellors hired by self - indulgent adults who felt they ’d lost their way in their personal lives or careers and needed to ‘ empower ’ themselves			1
but life coaching for children has become increasingly popular , with coaches tackling issues from bullying and low self - confidence to handling exam pressure and family difficulties			1
some will view this growing band as doing little more than pandering to the whims of neurotic parents , or those mums and dads who have big incomes but are time - poor , and so have had to outsource their own nurturing role			2
at £ 60 to £ 250 per session , life coaching for children does n’t come cheap			2
but @entity2 , who has a part - time personnel job , says she does n’t know how her family would have coped without @entity57 — who claims to be the only life coach in @entity60 to work with children as young as six			1
@entity2 insists that hiring a life coach was the best decision she could have made , and that the change in her daughter , now eight , has been dramatic			1
‘ life coaching was totally new to me but we ’d got to the point where we needed outside help , ’ says @entity2 , from @entity3			1
‘ @entity1 would come home from school and worry incessantly over what had happened in the playground			0
the issues she faced were n’t anything you do n’t find in playgrounds across the country , but in her mind they were insurmountable			0
' @entity2 is married to @entity81 , a senior product manager for a mobile phone company , and the couple also have a four - year - old son , @entity84			1
‘ @entity1 ’s unhappiness began to dominate family life , ’ @entity2 adds			1
‘ when , one night , she told me she wanted to “ dead myself ” — words ca n’t describe how distressing that was			2
’ in the end , two 45 - minute sessions with @entity57 were all @entity1 needed			2
‘ together they worked out a plan of different ways to handle situations that upset @entity1 , ’ explains @entity2			1
‘ she could try out the strategies — whether it was to play elsewhere , tell a teacher or say she did n’t like being called a “ loser ” — and see what worked			0
‘ it ’s not that the situations have gone away , but now she feels she has the tools to deal with them			0
almost a year later , @entity1 is a different child , more confident , and much less anxious			2
‘ it ’s like a weight has been taken off her shoulders , and mine too , ’ says @entity2			1
@entity2 says that just a year on her daughter @entity1 is a different child @entity2 believes one reason a life coach worked for @entity1 is that , as her mother , she had become part of the problem			1
she says : ‘ i felt that because i had become so emotional about the situation , i was probably making things worse			0
’ @entity57 , 39 , who has been life - coaching children for eight years , believes modern life has contributed to the growing popularity of counsellors like her			1
@entity57 , author of parenting guide @entity121 , says that children are often less co-operative as they are so absorbed in online activities			0
life coach @entity124 , who counsels both adults and children over 12 , agrees the rise in demand for life coaching for children has been driven by a changing social picture			1
in her view , it ’s the increasing number of families where mothers work , and so have less time for their children , and the extra pressures that girls are struggling with			0
‘ i ’ve noticed increasing issues with girls and body image , ’ she says			0
‘ there ’s so much peer pressure as well the pressure they put themselves under from seeing celebrities			0
’ but @entity124 also believes family breakdown is another factor			0
she often coaches children who say they can not talk to either parent without feeling as though they are taking sides			0
full - time mother @entity157 hopes the coaching her daughter @entity159 received this summer will help the ten - year - old cope with family dynamics she sometimes finds difficult			1
@entity157 is divorced from @entity159 ’s father and @entity159 now has a stepfather and two half - brothers			2
@entity157 , 41 , from @entity165 , took @entity159 to @entity167 - based coach @entity166 after they began arguing over work she had to do for her 11 - plus exam			1
‘ @entity159 was starting to feel very negative about passing the exam , even though she is very capable , ’ she says			0
@entity159 also lost her temper on a regular basis , and home was becoming a battleground			0
‘ @entity166 made @entity159 feel special , which gave her a confidence boost , ’ @entity157 says			2
‘ she had three hour - long sessions , which included ways to handle anger			2
she ’s more positive now and more able to control her temper			0
’ @entity181 , 38 , agrees that having an outsider involved in resolving a child ’s problems can work wonders			0
she took her son , @entity186 , 16 , to @entity166 last february when she began to fear he might not even turn up for his gcses			0
diagnosed with borderline adhd and @entity191 ’s syndrome as a young boy , @entity186 ’s behaviour improved as he matured , but his confidence remained low			0
@entity181 , a book - keeper from @entity195 , @entity167 , says her son had about ten hour - long sessions over five months			1
‘ @entity166 listened to what he had to say and tailor - made their sessions to suit his needs , she says			1
‘ she gave him simple and effective tools to help build up his self - esteem and make him feel more confident about his exams , to focus on what he could do rather what he could n’t			2
‘ as a result , he did better than i ’d ever imagined			0
he got @entity213 and @entity214 and recently started sixth form			0
’ however , @entity157 stresses that life coaching ‘ is not a magic wand ’			2
while it can help children cope with life better , the parental nurturing role is far from redundant yet .			2
