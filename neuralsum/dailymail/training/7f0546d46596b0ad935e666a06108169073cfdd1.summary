the email said : ‘ as you can imagine , since miss @entity3 ’s show has been aired , my client [ @entity13 ] has been inundated with offers from a lot of today ’s major tabloids , plus many television companies and radio			1
‘ now they all seem to want to talk to my client about @entity3 , and @entity3 only			2
‘ i ’ve asked my client not to talk to the press about @entity3 for ten years , and have let her live her life			1
‘ on monday this week we was approached ( sic ) by one of the biggest tabloids with a life - changing offer of £ 200,000 to disclose all			1
‘ my client is a quiet family man , and does n’t need the headache of this story coming out			0
’ @entity3 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) dated in 2002 and @entity13 threatened to sell intimate details about her to the press judge @entity56 at @entity18 told @entity13 : ' this was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum of money			1
' the court heard that he dated @entity3 when she was 17 , before changing his name by deed poll from @entity65			2
the email was sent on november 16 , 2011 , the day that ms @entity3 had starred in @entity67 , a reality television programme exploring her life as a rich youngster			1
it said the newspaper had set a deadline of 1pm on november 18 for @entity13 to respond by			0

' you felt extremely hurt , and within a few days of writing a bitter message , you were selling your story to a tabloid newspaper , and that speaks volumes about your true character			0
' ' she came to your attention again in november 2011 when she was the subject of a television series			0
the email that you sent on 16th november in which you threatened to reveal personal details was not the product of a broken heart			2
' all that was long in the past			0
' the judge added : ' it was nothing more than a cynical and greedy attempt to extract a large sum of money			1
' no doubt you thought that £ 200,000 , which is a large sum to most people , would be small change to somebody with the amount of money that she and her family are reputed to have			1
' you also thought that for this reason they would readily part with it to buy your silence			0
she did not do this			0
' the judge said that the well - known , well - connected and well - off did not deserve special protection , but the reality was that they were more likely to fall victim to this type of offence			2
he said : ' @entity127 is always an unpleasant and vicious offence			0
it can properly be said to be one of the worst offences that does not involve physical injury because of the fear and insecurity that it produces			0
' judge @entity56 added that although @entity13 has ‘ caring responsibilities ’ for his 13 - year - old son - a promising footballer - he still deserved a custodial sentence , the jury failed to reach a verdict about media studies student @entity142 who sent the email ms @entity3 is famous for being the daughter of @entity7 , the @entity8 supremo he said : ‘ although his mother is his primary carer you have taken an active and positive part in his upbringing and helping him to realise his ambitions			1
‘ he is of course entirely innocent of any involvement in this offence but your greed blinded you to the humiliation and misery that it would bring upon him			0
‘ there is a need to deter this type of offence which can be relatively easy to commit			0
‘ the least sentence i can pass on you is four years imprisonment			0
’ representatives of ms @entity3 said that she welcomed the sentence			2
her family lawyer @entity172 of the firm @entity173 said in a statement : ' @entity3 is relieved that @entity175 has acknowledged , in his sentencing of @entity5 , the serious nature of blackmail and the need to deter others from attempting to commit similar offences			1
' ms @entity3 was content to waive her anonymity in giving evidence because she strongly believes that all people have a right to be protected from such cynical and vicious behaviour			2
the sentence of four years is welcomed			0
' @entity23 stood trial alongside @entity13 but the jury failed to reach a verdict in his case and was discharged yesterday			0
he denied blackmail , claiming he was acting under orders from @entity13 , and is facing retrial .			0
