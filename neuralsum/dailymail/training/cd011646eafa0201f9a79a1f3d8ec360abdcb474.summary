@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has suspended the much - despised @entity3 re-development			1
@entity1 activists leading a sit - in were considering the promise by @entity0 to let the courts and a potential referendum decide the fate of the project - a plan that has sparked @entity1 's biggest protests in decades			1
since may 31 when the protests began , five people have died and thousands have been injured			0
at an end ? the protests over the @entity3 development have been bloody , and now prime minister @entity0 has said he will abide with a court decision or referendum on the project sadness : a protestor cuts herself with a razor blade symbolizing victims of @entity3 riots the pledge was made during last - ditch negotiations after @entity0 had issued what he called a ' final warning ' to protesters			1
the two - week standoff has damaged @entity0 's international reputation and led to repeated interventions by riot police			1
after initially inflaming tensions by dubbing the protesters ' terrorists , ' the prime minister has moderated his stance in closed - door talks in the last few days			1
@entity1 's prime minister on friday urged a small delegation of protesters to persuade hundreds of others occupying an @entity48 park to withdraw			1
wait for the courts : @entity0 's stance appears to have softened after he initially gave the protestors their ' final chance ' to leave the site @entity0 told party members friday that the protesters in the park had ' stayed long enough			1
' ' go and speak to them ... do n't let us be forced into reverting to different measures , ' @entity0 said he had told the protesters ' representatives			2
earlier in the day , @entity0 's ruling party announced that the government would suspend its plan to cut down trees in @entity3 and install a replica @entity68 barracks until the courts could rule on its legality			2
and even if the courts sided with the government , a city referendum would be held to determine the plan 's fate , officials said			2
it remained far from clear , however , whether the overtures would work			0
@entity0 has pledged to end the two - week protest but has also urged his supporters to rally in @entity80 and @entity48 this weekend			2
those demonstrations could raise tension between his conservative , @entity84 base and the people occupying the park who are mostly - but not all - liberal - and secular - minded			0
as night fell today , a festive mood pervaded the park , and the crowd of thousands swelled			0
many sang songs or snapped photos of makeshift barricades erected by protesters			0
the @entity98 group , two of whose members were in the meeting with @entity0 , has emerged as the most high - profile from the occupation that began last month			2
but it does not speak for all of the hundreds camping in the park , many of whom claim no affiliation to any group			0
@entity112 , a member of the umbrella group , said discussions in the park about @entity0 's initiative were continuing , but she sensed ' the general feeling is that the people 's requests were not addressed ' during the talks with the prime minister			1
' for instance on the police violence , there were requests that senior officials responsible be removed from duty , ' she said , referring to the protesters demands			2
' they ( authorities ) are saying that police officers are being investigated - which is not very satisfactory			0
' it was not clear when , or if , the protest groups would make a formal response to @entity0 's initiative			0
never give up : protestors sit at the @entity3 site - five have been killed in the dispute so far time to move : prime minister @entity0 continues to appeal to the protesters to evacuate an @entity48 park many protesters were still seething at how a peaceful protest has been sometimes overtaken as riot police clashed with groups of stone - and firebomb - throwing youths			1
such scenes prompted the @entity147 to condemn the heavy - handed response by @entity1 police			1
a may 31 police raid to clear out the park ignited demonstrations that morphed into broader protests against what many see as the prime minister 's increasingly authoritarian style of government			1
@entity0 's opponents have grown increasingly suspicious about what they call a gradual erosion of freedoms and secular @entity1 values under his @entity84 - rooted party 's government			1
it has passed new restrictions on alcohol and attempted but dropped a plan to limit women 's access to abortion			0
mobilizing the courts and a referendum , however , could shield the prime minister from accusations of an authoritarian response			1
' until the courts give their final verdicts , no action will be taken regarding @entity3 , ' said @entity179 , a spokesman for @entity0 's @entity180 , after the meeting			1
' even if the court ... is in favor of our government 's decisions , our government will hold a referendum to see what our people think - what they want and do n't want			0
' still fighting : a demonstrator wearing a @entity194 mask sits in front of a giant picture of the founder of modern @entity1 @entity198 and a @entity1 flag at the entrance of @entity3 opposition : an anti-government protester gestures in @entity48 's @entity203 over @entity0 and his @entity3 plans @entity204 , one of the @entity98 members who attended the meeting , said he believed @entity0 had offered ' positive words , ' and that fellow activists would consider them in a ' positive manner			1
' but he said those in @entity3 would ' make their own assessments			0
' ' we are @entity3 and we decide			0
no one has the luxury to decide on our behalf , ' he said			0
suspicion within the park about @entity0 's tactics and motives remains widespread			2
" the prime minister calls the people he pleases to the meetings and says some stuff , " said demonstrator @entity221			1
' we do n't care about them much			0
today , we saved the trees here but our main goal is to save the people			0
' analysts say the protests do n't present a threat to @entity0 's tenure , but do threaten his legacy			0
some say @entity0 would like to leave a mark on history , similar to that of @entity198 , the founding father of modern @entity1			2
@entity0 himself sat in front of a portrait of @entity198 during the overnight talks at his residence in @entity80 .			0

prime minister @entity0 will let the courts and a referendum decide
decision came after he had issued ' final warning ' to protesters
@entity147 has *criticised* ' heavy - handed ' tactics of @entity1 police
