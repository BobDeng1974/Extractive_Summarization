by @entity0 despite technology making it possible for us to speak to anyone around the world at any time , new research has found we still predominantly choose to communicate with people who live geographically nearby			0
by studying data from mobile network operators across @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , scientists highlighted that north - south divides as well as historical boundaries are still present			1
in particular , it found that in the @entity23 , only 9.5 per cent of communication between people living in both the @entity20 and the @entity21 of the country crossed a dividing line situated 100 miles north of @entity25			1
patterns reveal we still only predominantly talk to people who live in certain geographical areas , and highlighted north - south divides , and historical boundaries , can determine this spread of communication			1
this graphic shows the spread of calls made in @entity35 , with the boundaries highlighted in different colours according to research from @entity40 , @entity23 living rooms contain £ 23.5 billion of internet - connected devices , yet many use them to talk to people within the same house			2
the study found that almost half ( 48 per cent ) use instant messaging services while watching television			2
more than a quarter ( 28 per cent ) of people use devices to contact other people in the same household			0
this figure rises to 45 per cent among student and 18 to 24 - year - olds			0
elsewhere , @entity57 has a history of linguistic and social divide between the @entity61 - speaking @entity61 region , in the north , and @entity63 - speaking @entity64 , in the south			1
researchers from @entity67 , who conducted the study , found that only 3.5 per cent of communications take place between these regions			2
in @entity74 , only 7.8 per cent of communications cross a line roughly along the northern border of the @entity60			1
these invisible borders , the researchers say , ‘ help us grasp the social , civic , and commercial interactions that exist in contemporary nations , and may be of use to government officials and other policy experts			0
’ ‘ we are looking at networks to think about how communities are structured over space , ’ said @entity84 , an associate professor in @entity67 ’s @entity85			0
@entity57 has a history of linguistic and social divide between the @entity61 - speaking @entity61 region , in the north , and @entity63 - speaking @entity64 , in the south , pictured			1
according to the study , only 3.5 per cent of communications took place between these regions and crossed this historical boundary the study is part of a larger effort , he added , to see ‘ how we can use these technologies to better understand the extent of constituencies and communities			2
’ in addition to the @entity23 , @entity74 , and @entity57 , the researchers studied communication patterns in @entity63 , @entity35 , the @entity108 , and @entity14			1
they used anonymous data from network operators @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and the @entity114			1
the researchers mapped the connections in two iterations : first at a larger scale , and then at a more local level , to see network patterns across and within regions and communities			2
this highlighted that in @entity63 , for example , patterns of communication closely mirrored the nation ’s historical administrative @entity126 the data also revealed a larger east - west divide running almost the length of the country			1
according to co-author @entity138 : ‘ the findings show that , for all the digital connectivity in civic life today , people still connect in a geographically cohesive , connected set of communities			0
the researchers claim this kind of mapping could be useful for governments when discussing political or administrative boundaries			0
it could also be used for market analysis or other forms of research			0
‘ we ’re more interested in the theory behind it , ’ @entity84 said , ‘ and in how this can contribute to a ‘ science of cities			0
’ ’ the findings are published in the journal @entity156 .			0

study looked at communication patterns in @entity160 , @entity13 and @entity14
it used data from @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity164 and @entity113
@entity166 found north - south divides and historical boundaries still exist
in the @entity23 , 9.5 *%* of communications cross a line 100 miles north of @entity25
divides between @entity61 and @entity63 regions in @entity57 were also *spotted*
