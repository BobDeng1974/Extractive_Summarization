sir @entity2 declared his love for the recently bereaved woman and told her he needed to work out at the gym so he could ' make love ' to her			1
he denied that his behaviour was motivated by financial gain or sexual desire - but a committee sitting at the @entity23 in @entity24 has now ruled that this was in fact false			2
the 67 - year - old will be banned from nursing if the @entity28 decides that his misconduct has impaired his fitness to practice			2
sir @entity2 regularly visited the elderly patient and showered her with gifts and flowers , accepting thousands of pounds in return			1
the woman 's family became so concerned about his behaviour that they bugged her phone - and heard him calling her ' @entity40 ' and saying he had to go to the gym or he ' would n't be able to make love ' to her			1
@entity28 panel chairman @entity44 said today that he had ' manipulated a vulnerable patient ' while motivated by sexual gratification and greed			2
she added that the woman , known as ' @entity49 ' , was ' clearly grief - stricken ' following the death of her husband , and needed bereavement counselling which sir @entity2 was not qualified to give			1
' you gave evidence which the panel often found difficult to believe , ' mrs @entity53 told sir @entity2			1
' you lacked consistency in your response , added evidence and altered your story as it suited you			0
' we concluded that you lied at the outset of the investigation and as the hearing continued			0
as evidence was put before you you modified your account			0
' the panel finds it incredible that the endearments and erotic language you used at no other time than on the occasions on the tape			0
' you were deliberately evasive and not consistent but intentionally changed your story			0
' she added : ' the persistent nature of the telephone calls , late at night and early in the morning and the giving of gifts and eating together in an intimate setting were sexually motivated			2

after the patient told her two daughters that she had begun an affair with the married father of three , they bugged her phone and were horrified to hear his repeated professions of love			2
mrs @entity44 said that the sisters acted solely out of concern for their mother , and were not motivated by financial gain			0
sir @entity2 , currently a visiting professor at @entity99 in @entity100 , insisted that his chats with @entity49 were nothing more than ' banter '			1
he told the hearing : ' some of the phone calls later were sexual in some respects but it was n't an offer of having sex with somebody or anything like that			1
