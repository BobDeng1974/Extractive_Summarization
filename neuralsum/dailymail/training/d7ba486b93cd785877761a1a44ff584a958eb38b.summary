scientists have made some of the most precise measurements yet of the remnants of the universe ’s oldest light			0
known as the cosmic microwave background , researchers found the hidden ‘ skeleton ’ of the cosmos that first began to see it take shape just 380,000 years after the @entity12			1
and mapping the universe in this way could help uncover some of its mysteries including dark matter and dark energy			1
research led by @entity20 studied the early universe			1
the @entity23 consortium detected the polarisation of light 380,000 years after the @entity12 using microwave detectors on the @entity26 in @entity28 's @entity27 ( pictured ) the findings were made by the @entity31 consortium led by dr @entity32 from the @entity20			1
using microwave detectors mounted on the @entity26 in @entity28 ’s @entity27 , the team were able to make measurements of the universe			1
polarbear measures remnant radiation from the @entity12 , which has cooled and stretched with the expansion of the universe to microwave lengths			2
this cosmic microwave background , the @entity43 , acts as an enormous backlight , illuminating the large - scale structure of the universe and carrying an imprint of cosmic history			0
sensitive instruments called bolometers , located in telescopes , can record this light from the young universe			0
they record the direction of the light ’s electric field and , in so doing , create a map of how light was once distributed in the universe			0
but of most importance was that the @entity31 team found ‘ twists ’ in this structure of the light from 380,000 after the @entity12			1
this suggested it had been warped by mysterious entities such as dark matter and neutrinos			2
their research is separate but similar to the @entity74 results published earlier this year that found a signature of cosmic inflation			1
this is the remnant of the rapidly ballooning universe when it was just a fraction of a fraction of a second old			0
what the @entity31 team found was a specific ‘ polarisation ’ of the initial light in the universe			2
polarisation in astronomy basically refers to the way in which light , in the form of waves , travels through the universe			0
b - mode polarisation , which was the type measured in this research by the @entity31 team , is associated with magnetic fields			2
the other type , @entity95 , refers to electric fields			0
while @entity95 polarisation contains some information , b - mode polarisation contains more , because photons carry this only if matter around the last point of scattering was unevenly distributed			0
thus its discovery by the @entity31 team is deemed as being an important look into the early universe			1
after the @entity12 , 13.8 billion years ago , the universe was so hot and dense that light bounced endlessly from one particle to another , scattering and ionising any atoms that formed			1
only when the universe was 380,000 years old was it sufficiently cool to allow an electron and a proton to form a stable hydrogen atom without being immediately broken apart			2
suddenly , all the light particles - called photons - were set free			0
this latest finding reveals the hidden ' skeleton ' of the universe 380,000 years after the @entity12			1
illustrated here is a separate image provided by the @entity125 earlier this year that shows dark matter density in the evolution of the universe ‘ the photons go from bouncing around like balls in a pinball machine to flying straight and basically allowing us to take a picture of the universe from only 380,000 years after the @entity12 , ' said dr @entity32			1
‘ the universe was a lot simpler then : mainly hydrogen plasma and dark matter			2
’ these photons , which , today , have cooled to a mere 3 degrees @entity141 above absolute zero , still retain information about their last interaction with matter			0
specifically , the flow of matter due to density fluctuations where the photon last scattered gave that photon a certain polarisation			0
and it was the remnants of these that were detected by the @entity31 team			0
‘ think of it like this : the photons are bouncing off the electrons , and there is basically a last kiss , they touch the last electron and then they go for 14 billion years until they get to telescopes on the ground , ’ @entity32 said			0
‘ that last kiss is polarising			0
’ @entity31 may also eventually confirm or refute the @entity74 results , although so far it has focused on interpreting the polarisation pattern of the microwave background to map the distribution of matter back in time to the universe 's inflationary period , 380,000 years after the @entity12			1
@entity31 's approach , which is different from that used by @entity74 , may allow the group to determine when dark energy , the mysterious force accelerating the expansion of the universe , began to dominate and overwhelm gravity , which throughout most of cosmic history slowed the expansion .			1

research led by @entity20 studied the early universe
the @entity31 consortium detected the polarisation of light 380,000 years after the @entity12 using microwave detectors on a telescope in @entity28
it reveals the hidden ' skeleton ' of the universe before *galaxies* formed
and this finding suggests dark matter influenced the young cosmos
study *compliments* other research such as previous @entity74 results
