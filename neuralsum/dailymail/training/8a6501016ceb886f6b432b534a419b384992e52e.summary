published : 11:33 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 25 january 2013 he wowed us all with his spectacular dives alongside @entity3 at last summer 's @entity4 and is the most successful diver in @entity7 @entity4 history			0
yet despite his achievements over an impressive four olympic games , @entity8 has always had an image problem			1
with a strong @entity13 accent and a head he has shaved since he started losing his hair as a teenager - he admits that many people mistook him for a ' thug			1
' he badly wanted to soften his image and decided the obvious solution was a hair transplant			1
@entity8 ( left ) with his diving partner @entity3			1
he said he felt his baldness make him ' look like a thug ' @entity8 , 31 , has a strong baldness gene in his family and both his brothers have lost their hair			1
the father - of - two said : ' i started going bald when i was 18 which is when i got really serious about diving , although i 've been told this had nothing to do with it			0
' i had completely lost my hairline and the only way to cover it up was by shaving my head			2
' i come from the @entity39 of @entity40 and i would find that people could sometimes be intimidated by my @entity13 accent and my shaved head			1
' i think some people wrongly got the impression that i was a bit of a thug – which could not be further from the truth			1
' i am a loving family man and have dedicated my life to diving and helping others			0
' @entity8 before the treatment			2
the purple line marks where the hair would be transplanted @entity8 after the treatment , which involved moving 4,200 hairs from the back of his head to the top of his scalp to restore his hairline the silver medallist lives in @entity65 with his wife @entity66 , 30 , and sons @entity68 , 11 , and @entity69 , four			1
he added : ' i wanted to soften my whole image and make sure that i was a little more approachable to strangers			2
the best way to do that was by having a hair transplant			1
' @entity8 had approximately 4,200 hairs moved from the back of his head to the top of his scalp to restore his hairline at the @entity76 in @entity77			1
@entity78 gold medallist @entity8 had the same @entity80 procedure as @entity81			2
during the procedure last month , around 1,500 grafts were transplanted to his hairline and a further 1,000 were transplanted to bolster his hair at the top of his scalp			2
it will take around a year for the full benefits of the procedure to show as the transplanted hair grows back			1
there has been 25 per cent rise in the number of men having hair transplants in the last five years as the technology improves and high - profile stars such as @entity81 and the @entity97 actor @entity96 have gone public to show the benefits of the procedures			1
top tresses : @entity81 famously spent a staggering £ 30,000 in his quest to get the perfect head of hair the procedure was carried out by hair transplant surgeon @entity105			1
he has performed similar procedures on a string of celebrities including dr @entity110 from @entity111 's @entity112 and the model and tv presenter @entity114			0
dr @entity105 said : ' there are seven categories of male pattern baldness			0
category one indicates no hair loss and seven is total hair loss			0
' @entity8 ranked as a @entity122 – indicating substantial hair loss due to his family history			1
like a lot of the men i have treated , he found that the transplant significantly boosted his self - esteem			0
' he looks and feels a lot younger , too			0
there is no doubt that a hair transplant can completely transform a man ’s life			1
' @entity8 said : ' i am so glad that i had it done – i feel so much more confident now			2
i am really looking forward to being able to grow my hair for the first time since i was a teenager and present a new image of myself to the world			2
' he is now @entity8 is looking forward to competing in the @entity78 in @entity143 in 2014 with @entity3 , despite uncertainty over his funding			2
he said : ' we are both really excited about the @entity78 , and hopefully i can also go on and compete at a fifth @entity4 in @entity147 in 2016			0
' dr @entity105 from the @entity76 in @entity77 , said : hair transplantation is the only method that is guaranteed to overcome hair loss and regain hair			0
medications can halt hair loss but they will not lead to the regrowth of lost hair			0
there are many types of hair transplant			1
in both cases , transplantation can be done so well that often a barber or stylist can not even tell that grafts have been placed			0
the transplanted hair is permanent and in nearly all cases will stay in place for the rest of the patient ’s life			0
the most popular and cost - effective method is called @entity171 – popularly known as ‘ strip harvesting ’ - where hair follicles are removed in a ‘ strip ’ of skin from the back or side of the head and moved to the thinning areas at the top of the scalp			1
the second technique - and the one @entity8 had - is called @entity183			2
it is more expensive than strip harvesting and is the procedure which was used on @entity81 when he had his transplant in 2011			0
the main difference is the hairs follicles are removed and transplanted individually as opposed to in one single strip			0
it is more time consuming – and therefore more expensive – than strip harvesting			0
this method is particularly popular with men who like to keep their hair short because there is virtually no scarring			0
in @entity183 , or @entity80 , individual follicles are extracted directly from the back or side of scalp , usually one at a time			1
there will be some minor scarring – which looks like pin pricks – immediately after the operation but this disappears during the healing process which takes approximately 5 - 7 days after which any redness or slight swelling in the treatment area will have subsided			0
@entity80 generally has a quicker patient recovery time and lower post-operative discomfort than strip harvesting .			0

it will take a year for the full benefits of the transplant to show
