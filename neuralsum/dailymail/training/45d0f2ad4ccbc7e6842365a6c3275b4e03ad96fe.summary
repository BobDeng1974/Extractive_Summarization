@entity0 does not believe that @entity1 dived to win a penalty during @entity4 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 - but admitted the winger made ' too much ' of the tackle			1
during the second half of the match , @entity1 appeared to throw himself over @entity5 defender @entity11 's out - stretched leg in the penalty area with the ball already past him			1
referee @entity14 booked @entity1 for simulation and waved away the @entity4 players ’ appeals for a spot - kick			1
' he lifted the ball across the player ( @entity11 ) and the opponent is kicking him			2
' so after that he was jumping too much i think but what counts is that he was kicked by the opponent and then the referee can give a penalty			0
’ when asked again by @entity40 if @entity1 dived , @entity27 replied : ' no i do n't think so			1
he was tackled in my opinion but after that he was exaggerating			0
‘ it is not diving because he was not touched by the opponent and i think that is always the reason and the rest is rubbish			0
' the incident occurred with the game evenly poised at 1 - 1			0
@entity49 had opened the scoring against the run of play for the visitors in the first half when he tapped in an @entity57 cross			0
@entity58 then equalised for the @entity5 on his home debut with a bullet header on the half - hour mark			2
and @entity27 rued the referee 's decision not to award a penalty for the @entity1 incident , or when @entity66 appeared to be fouled just moments before by @entity67			1
contentious : @entity27 also believed @entity67 's tackle on @entity66 could have been a penalty opener : @entity49 put @entity4 ahead with a close - range effort in the first - half leveller : but @entity58 equalised for @entity5 with a header from the corner after half an hour the @entity75 continued : ' the same i think he ( the referee ) can also give the penalty to @entity78			1
' you can see that @entity78 was already losing the ball but the tackle was already coming and that is the reason why he has to give the penalty or not			0
' there are referees who would give a penalty but nevertheless we have to create more chances than penalties			0
' @entity27 was also asked about the potential imminent arrival of @entity89 from @entity90 for a fee of £ 60million			1
he refused to say @entity4 would sign the @entity93 winger , but did admit he liked the player			2
' yeah ( i do like @entity89 ) , but i like @entity96 also , ' said @entity27			2
‘ there are an awful lot of players that i like but they can not always come to @entity4			0
' ' i think always the club has to announce it when they are ready and when we are thinking it is the right time for a transfer then we come to you and we say " we have bought that player or the other player "			0
' @entity108 : @entity27 also admitted that he was keen on signing @entity89 from @entity90			1

@entity27 does not believe @entity1 dived for a penalty against @entity5
but the @entity4 boss admitted that the winger made ' too much ' of it
@entity1 booked for simulation after going down under @entity11 tackle
@entity75 also admits he was keen on signing of @entity89
