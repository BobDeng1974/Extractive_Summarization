by @entity1 reporter published : 13:08 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 14:06 est , 27 january 2014 on the roster : @entity4 , 26 , has been assigned the 1pm time slot on @entity6 @entity6 has given @entity4 a time slot for his new show which will start late next month			1
the 26 - year - old 's yet - untitled show will take the 1pm time slot on the cable news network and will premiere on february 24			1
@entity4 is @entity13 's son and a former foreign policy official in the @entity16 administration			1
the announcement about his program is just one in a series of moves that the network is making as it shuffles its daytime schedule			0
@entity4 will be followed by a new show at 2pm with @entity25 , managing editor of @entity26			1
current shows hosted by @entity28 and @entity29 will air at 11am and noon respectively			0
the daytime openings were created by the move of @entity32 to the early slot before ' morning @entity34 ' and the exit of @entity36 following crude comments he made about @entity38			0
@entity39 moved her show from noon to 4pm in the wake of @entity36 's exit , and she 'll keep that schedule			2
following weeks of speculation , @entity36 released a statement at the beginning of december explaining his decision to resign over the ' ill - judged ' comments about the former @entity52 governor 's comparison of the federal debt to slavery			0
he previously apologized to @entity38 both on and off camera , but came under further fire when fellow @entity6 host @entity57 was fired for making homophobic comments to journalists outside of his apartment while he was not formally reprimanded in any way until now			0
starting early : @entity4 has previously worked as a special adviser to @entity63 when she was the secretary of state ( pictured here in 2011 ) and also held the title of global youth ambassador for the @entity68 @entity6 is known for their left - leaning political allegiances , and @entity4 adds another connection to the @entity72 party to their channel 's roster			1

@entity39 , whose show will immediately precede @entity4 's , is engaged to the @entity82 chef , @entity81			1
the couple have kept their relationship purposefully quiet but were dating for about a year before eagle - eyed viewers began noticing that @entity39 was wearing an engagement ring on a very precarious finger in october			0
@entity89 and new : @entity36 ( left ) resigned in early december and @entity39 ( right ) was promptly bumped up to his noon time slot to take over no details about @entity4 's contract with @entity6 have been released , so his salary remains a secret , but he clearly plans to be around for a while as he just bought a $ 1.495million condo near @entity97 in @entity98			1
the @entity99 reported that @entity4 bought the two bedroom , two bathroom apartment in a building that allows the owner access to a communal roof deck that looks out at the @entity105 on one side and @entity107 on the other			2
according to @entity110 , 15th floor apartment has skyline views visible through the floor - to - ceiling windows that keeps the apartment flooded with natural light			0
the apartment is has an easy commute to @entity6 's studios in @entity118 , and it seems fitting that it should be on the city 's west side as that is where his mother has always lived .			0

@entity13 's son will *launch* his new show on february 24
they have yet to release the name of @entity4 's show
