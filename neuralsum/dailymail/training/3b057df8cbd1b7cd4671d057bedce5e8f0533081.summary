police should be allowed to catch 40 winks while on duty – and given special ' sleep pods ' where they can nod off , say experts			1
work time ' sleep breaks ' could help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration , according to researchers			1
instead of reaching for high sugar , high carb foods to maintain alertness , officers on night shifts could take brief power naps in pods like those used by multinational firms like @entity20			2
researchers say that police officers should be allowed to take sleep breaks to help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration ( file picture ) thousands of police from six forces are taking part in an ' officer wellbeing ' study commissioned by the @entity32 into the benefits of dozing at work			1
study leader @entity35 , who runs the ' fatigue management ' firm @entity36 , said the results of his study – due to be published later this year – would recommend ' power naps '			2
he said : ' there appears to be a caffeine culture among police officers – they use counter-measures to maintain their alertness			1
people working the night shift are a lot more likely to reach for high sugar , high carb foods to give them the quick lift they need			0
' all that has a significant effect on health and performance			0
together with increased workloads as a result of widespread budget cuts there appears to be rising levels of stress as well as absence			0
' he added : ' i would suggest that where there is the ability to set up a room with appropriate furniture ( beds or sleep pods ) , that would be a very appropriate strategy			1
' mr @entity35 said @entity71 and @entity72 both ' napped ' during the day and that a ' siesta culture ' was important for a person 's wellbeing			0
senior police , however , have said the idea would be ' unworkable ' and that the public would expect officers to be wide awake while on duty			1
although there is no ' official ' ban on officers snoozing on duty , it is widely discouraged among the workforce			1
one inspector at @entity89 , who asked not to be named , said : ' if someone is murdered and it comes out that half the response officers on duty at the time were asleep it would obviously not look good for us			0
' @entity98 , president of the @entity99 , said officers do need to be in a ' position to respond '			0
study leader @entity102 suggested officers on night shifts could take brief power naps in pods similar to those used by @entity20 ( file picture ) she explained : ' i 'm not aware of any prohibition on napping but the reality is officers do need to be in a position to respond			2
' i am conscious officer wellbeing needs to be on the agenda of all forces in the future as numbers are reduced and officers are being asked to do more			2
' meanwhile @entity121 , of the @entity122 , added : ' we hope that this study will go some way to assisting our officers and organisations in improving the management of fatigue in the future			2
' the potential benefits of this being firstly an assessment that will make instant recommendations , often small changes that will improve quality of life , and secondly the collection of data which will enable analysis of what makes the most impact on officer fatigue			0
' we have since been joined in the study by several other services , including , @entity89 , @entity146 and @entity147 ; their participation will strengthen the quality of data gathered and is a great boost			0
' a spokesman for the @entity153 said it was acting to reduce fatigue by working with occupational health , welfare and safety experts in individual forces			1
the study will be discussed by police chiefs later this year , with a view to piloting the scheme in several forces .			0

experts say officers should be given ' sleep pods ' so they can take naps
add nap breaks help reduce fatigue and promote better concentration
comes as six forces take part in wellbeing study by @entity32
however , senior police officers have said the plan would be unworkable
sleeping on duty is allowed but widely discouraged among the workforce
