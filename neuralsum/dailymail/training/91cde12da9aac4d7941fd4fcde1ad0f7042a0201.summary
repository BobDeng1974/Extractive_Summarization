by @entity0 , @entity1 will @entity2 continued his impressive form ahead of the @entity4 with another quick time - even if he lost out in a three - way photo finish in the 110 metres hurdles at @entity7 on sunday			1
running on a purpose - built track in the shadow of @entity10 and @entity11 at the @entity12 , the 29 - year - old , who is in the form of his life after twice running a personal best of 13.21 seconds this summer , clocked 13.24secs into a slight headwind			2
the bad news was it was only good enough for third , @entity2 just edged out by @entity22 silver medallist @entity21 , who was credited with the win , and @entity24 from @entity25 , with all three given the same time			1
form of his life : 110m hurdler @entity2 is preparing for the @entity4 jumper : the 110m hurdler came third at @entity7 on sunday but he took the scalp of @entity30 champion and world record holder @entity32 , while the time maintained @entity2 's hugely encouraging recent run , which has most notably included a victory over world number one and @entity4 rival @entity37 of @entity38 at @entity39 last weekend			2
@entity2 , the @entity4 silver medallist four years ago , told @entity1 : " the times i am running on average now would get medals at all of the championships			2
' before it would take a @entity22 final for me to run a personal best , now i 'm doing them in rain , hail or shine			0
' i 'm running quicker than i do in the finals			0
so hopefully , given the way i 've been operating in the past , when the final comes i lift my game and step up again			0
' that 's what i 'm working towards , making my average time much faster so , even if i get to the final and have a bad race , we can come away with something			0
' @entity7 was used memorably for beach volleyball at @entity61 and staged jousts during the reign of @entity64 , but @entity66 champion @entity65 came off second best again in his tussle with @entity69 @entity68			1
second place : @entity65 had to settle for runner up behind @entity68 of the @entity69 in the @entity72 100m rivalry : @entity74 ( left ) of the @entity69 takes first place over @entity76 in the 100m beaten in @entity77 last weekend , @entity65 had to settle for second place once more as he continued his comeback from injury			1
in the absence of compatriot and @entity30 champion @entity84 , who pulled out as a precaution following a knee problem , @entity81 claimed long jump victory with 7.94m			0
@entity74 responded to a storming start from @entity76 to win the 100m , bursting through in the second half of the race to beat her @entity38 rival , the two - time reigning @entity30 champion , into second , although a faulty clock meant she was unable to find out her time			0
there were also victories for @entity66 champions @entity99 in the @entity89 and @entity101 in the @entity102 shot put , @entity61 silver medallist @entity103 in the @entity102 / 44 long jump and world champion @entity105 in the @entity106 / 38 100m .			1
