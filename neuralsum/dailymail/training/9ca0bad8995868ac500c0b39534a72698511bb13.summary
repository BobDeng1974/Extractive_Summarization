@entity0 has urged @entity1 to address their defensive problems in the january transfer window or risk missing out on the @entity4 again			1
@entity1 dropped to 10th place in the @entity6 after sunday 's 1 - 0 derby defeat to @entity8 and @entity0 fears his former club could now finish outside the top four for the second successive season			1
@entity12 was sacked last april just 10 months after succeeding sir @entity13 as @entity1 went from champions to seventh - their lowest league position for 25 years - and replaced by the experienced @entity16			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity18 at @entity19 in september 2007 @entity20 and @entity0 ( centre ) congratulate @entity22 ( right ) after his goal against @entity24 in 2007 ' i hope they finish in top four but i ca n't be sure , ' said @entity0 , who scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for @entity1 between 2004 and 2008			1
' a club of this size should be looking for the fourth spot to be in the @entity4 but it is not the case right now			0
' you could say the issues are at the back but it 's about balance , finding the right midfielder to keep the ball and a defender to be strong at a certain point of the game			0
former @entity44 , @entity1 and @entity45 striker @entity0 was speaking at the @entity46 in @entity47 ' it 's difficult to predict what will happen but when you have a very balanced side you have balanced results			1
' i 'm not more experienced than @entity16 to know what was a ( defensive ) regret for him but we will see at the end of the season , and what he does in this window this winter will be very important for @entity1			0
' @entity0 , speaking at the @entity46 in @entity47 , believes @entity59 will get the time to turn around @entity1 that was not afforded to @entity12 , who took the @entity61 from @entity1 to @entity45 in 2008			1
but @entity0 said @entity59 must listen to the concerns of the fans and add defensive strength in january to go with the impressive attacking armoury he now has at his disposal following a summer of heavy investment which saw @entity67 and @entity68 added to the likes of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
' you always have to listen to what people say and maybe the defence is a bit weak or not experienced enough , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity45 manager @entity12 speaks to @entity0 after his side 's 2 - 1 @entity78 win over @entity80 in 2009 ' he ( @entity59 ) has to look at it and address that point for sure , but he is an experienced manager so i 've no doubt he will do so			1
' i have seen a slight change and you can see there is a bit more confidence and a bit more shape , but the result is not what you would expect from a side like this			0
' @entity95 will definitely be on his side more than @entity12 because of the experience he has and the trophies in all his clubs			0
' you expect the @entity6 to be a difficult challenge for any team and @entity1 has been struggling in the last two years , but in football you have to make the transition as soon as possible			2
' but @entity0 rejected criticism that @entity1 's failure to improve under @entity59 was down to the @entity16 being surprised by the intensity of the @entity6			1
' he 's experienced , he has plenty of gigabytes of information and people there with him who know about football , ' @entity0 said			2
' it would be unthinkable for @entity1 not to be in the @entity4 again but the @entity6 is a different league to what it was 10 years ago			2
' there are many teams that have got huge players and the quality is greater - that 's why i stopped , i think ! ' the level and intensity what you can show every week is amazing , there are no easy games			0
