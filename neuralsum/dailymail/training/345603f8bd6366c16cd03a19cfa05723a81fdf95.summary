@entity0 has always possessed the skill and technique to be an international footballer			1
the question marks only ever concerned whether he would be studious enough to read the game at the highest level and whether his body would stand up to the physical strain			2
all the signs are that the 22 - year - old is maturing into a player who could yet develop into an established talent at the top of the game			1
firstly there are those injury issues			2
@entity0 ’s ankles appeared to be the major impediment to his development over recent years but with a good pre-season behind him , @entity0 has been almost ever present for @entity21 and has started all three @entity23 games			1
he is at heart an instinctive player but in conversation with @entity0 at @entity23 ’s hotel in @entity32 on friday afternoon , his willingness to study the game is evident			1
@entity35 and the @entity23 coaches have been encouraging him to watch the best holding midfielders in the world as part of his education and it seems he has been assiduous in doing his homework			1
‘ i have been watching @entity43 on video in the past couple of weeks , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he had a record number of passes in one game , nearly 200 in one match , which is ridiculous			2
watching players like him and @entity24 , you learn how clever they are how intelligent they are on the ball			2
@entity35 has encouraging @entity0 to watch the best holding midfielders in the world ‘ in that role it ’s important you have to understand that if you lose the ball , the opposition are in a dangerous position to counter-attack			1
whereas if i was playing a little bit higher , on the edge of the box , you can lose it and you have players around who can get the ball back			2
you learn how they use the ball and you learn when it ’s a good time to dribble or sometimes pass			2
i enjoy playing that role			2
i enjoy getting on the ball and starting attacks			0
’ @entity0 may have to get used to it			1
against @entity74 , he thrived in the second half in the holding role and @entity23 lack a natural midfielder to play there			1
@entity0 is being encouraged to make the position his own			1
‘ i get the clips through on my @entity81			0
the analyst guys here send them to me and they highlight some of his key points , his key strengths			0
it ’s only 20 - 25 minutes			2
that ’s part and parcel of learning			0
even when i watch my games back , i think : “ what am i doing now ? i should have done that ! ” it was my second game in that position against @entity74 and i thought : “ i ’ve already improved			1
” so there ’s a lot more to come from me in that position , but the more i watch players like that , the quicker i ’ll learn			2
’ wilshere boards the plane to @entity103 at @entity104 on saturday @entity0 conveys a degree of humility which , for @entity108 football , is encouraging			1
it will be some time before a collection of @entity23 players inspire a nation burnt by a decade of failures but , after the dismal @entity116 , the win in @entity115 was at least a building block for this group			1
‘ as players now , we do n’t have to worry about the past , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ basically all the players from that golden generation have now stopped playing at international level , so there ’s a space for us to come in and write some history ourselves , if you like			0
we ’re young , we ’re eager , we want to learn , and we want to win something with @entity23			1
at the end of the day , that ’s the main thing			0
we want to get through this qualification and go to the @entity131 and really do something			0
‘ we are not worried about what you call @entity23 ’s poor record			1
all we can do is concentrate on the games ahead and what we can do			2
we are on a good run and we want to continue the good form from the @entity115 game			0
‘ i thought we did that against @entity74			0
the captain [ @entity141 ] wants that togetherness ; he wants us to come together at the beginning of the game			0
’ no one will ever be foolish enough to tag a generation of @entity23 players with exorbitant expectations again , the scars of the golden generation ’s failures still raw			1
but there is something fresh and vibrant about this group of players			0
like all young people , they have a healthy disrespect for what ’s gone before , intent on forging their own futures @entity43 set a @entity163 record with 204 touches of the ball ‘ there are a lot of players who have come through the @entity169 together , who are now in the seniors , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are good friends off the pitch and we are of a similar age			0
we have really worked on team spirit and i think you can see that in matches			0
win or lose , we always stick together			0
‘ i played with @entity178 for a number of years			0
he ’s a close mate of mine			0
and i grew up with @entity180 at @entity21 [ @entity180 started his youth career at @entity21 ]			1
@entity182 and @entity183 were fantastic for @entity23 — and i looked up to them even from when i was a young kid , and to play with them in an @entity23 game was a dream come true for me — but now they ’ve moved on			1
‘ before the @entity115 game people were questioning : “ are they ready ? ” i think we prove every game that we ’re learning			0
as young @entity108 players at the top level , there ’s no better place to learn			2
as each game goes on , i think we ’re getting closer and better as a team and i think there ’s a lot more to come			0
’ @entity0 wants to emulate @entity24 's cleverness on the ball talking to @entity0 , it ’s hard to accept that idea that younger players have no enthusiasm for their international careers			1
the @entity21 player ’s eyes light up a little when he is asked whether he can imagine winning 100 caps for his country — he has 23 at present — as @entity141 will next month			1
‘ yes , of course			0
even when i was growing up i looked up to people like that			0
i remember growing up watching the @entity131 in 2004 and @entity141 was there , @entity183 was there , @entity182 was there and all of a sudden i was involved with them when i was 18			0
‘ they ’ve been great role models for me			0
he ’s a great leader , he ’s always talking to us			0
his goal - scoring record is fantastic and his love for the game — everyone can see it			2
he ’s such a great role model			0
‘ he ’s the only one now who has been playing for @entity23 for 10 years , with the likes of @entity183			1
he ’s been through that generation			0
now he really feels like , he ’s the dad figure if you like			0
he puts his arm around us , brings us together and gets us going			0
’ it may take some time before anyone gets over-excited about @entity23 again			2
but if @entity0 and his team - mates keep up their homework , perhaps we can expect a graduation ceremony sooner rather later			1
@entity0 won glowing praise for his role as @entity23 ’s holding midfielder against @entity74 , but he admits he ’s still got plenty to learn if he wants to eclipse the master of the art , @entity43			1
@entity0 described as ' ridiculous ' a recent match in which @entity244 star @entity43 completed an astonishing 204 passes against @entity246 — that ’s 117 more than @entity0 managed during his man - of - the - match display at @entity248			1
listed are the two midfielders ’ stats from those two matches , figures which reveal the @entity254 schemer is in a class of his own .			2

@entity0 has been almost ever present for @entity21 and has started all three @entity23 games
the 22 - year - old @entity21 midfielder is *finally* maturing into a top talent after all those injuries
@entity35 and the @entity23 coaches have been encouraging @entity0 to watch the best holding midfielders in the world
