by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 27 september 2013 texting a lot and sleep deprivation are directly linked in young adults , according to new research			1
researchers suspect the reasons behind the link could include feeling pressured to respond immediately to texts , no matter what time of day or night , and sleeping with the phone nearby , thus being awakened by the alerts from incoming texts			1
the new study by @entity13 and @entity15 psychology professor @entity14 found that frequent text messaging was also associated with greater psychological vulnerability to interpersonal stress			1
the study examined links among interpersonal stress , text - messaging behavior , and health in an article in the latest edition of @entity26 , @entity14 reported that texting was a direct predictor of sleep problems among first year @entity15 students			1
the study examined links among interpersonal stress , text - messaging behavior , and three indicators of college students ' health : burnout , sleep problems and emotional well - being , reports @entity38			1
to assess students ' sleep quality , @entity14 used the @entity41 with minor modifications to fit the college sample			2
the widely - used instrument measures multiple aspects of sleep quality such as sleep duration , the amount of time it takes to fall asleep , the amount of time actually spent sleeping while in bed , nighttime disturbances , and daytime sleepiness			2
' these correlational findings provide an initial indication that heavy text messaging could be problematic during times of stress , ' writes @entity14			0
' although speculative , it could be argued that text messaging is a uniquely unsuitable mode of communication for coping with interpersonal stress in close relationships			0
' she suggests that the abbreviated language that is common in texting lacks the ability to provide the kind of nuance that is important in discussing sensitive issues			0
in addition , texting fails to offer critical non-verbal cues that would be part of a face - to - face conversation			0
researchers say texting is an unsuitable mode of communication for coping with stress in close relationships ' text messaging may carry a high risk of producing or maintaining misunderstandings and / or unproductive interactions during periods of stress , ' she writes			2
' when interpersonal stress involves conflict , the conditions required for productive communication may be particularly difficult to achieve through texting			2
' researchers found the impact of texting on psychological wellbeing depended on the level of interpersonal stress partiicpants were already facing			1
but more texting was associated with poorer sleep regardless of their previous stress levels			1
the students in the study , all in their first year , answered questions that measured academic and social burnout , emotional well - being and sleep problems			1
@entity14 also asked them to estimate how many text messages they send and receive on an average day			0
the study 's findings on sleep were especially significant given the well - documented compromises in sleep that students experience throughout college , but especially in the first year			2
several recent studies have shown that 70 percent of college students receive less than the eight recommended hours of sleep			0
a 2007 survey by the @entity117 concluded that 40 percent of students feel rested only two days a week			0
the key finding was that a higher number of daily texts was associated with more sleep problems			0
@entity14 notes that this finding reinforces previous evidence pointing to a direct association between cell - phone use and poor sleep in adolescents and emerging adults .			0

@entity15 students who texted a lot suffered more sleep deprivation
causes include pressure to respond and sleeping with phone nearby
texting a lot also *negatively* impacts stress and emotional wellbeing
@entity13 and @entity15 study is in @entity26
