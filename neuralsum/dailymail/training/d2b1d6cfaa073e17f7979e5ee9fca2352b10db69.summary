in a real life story akin to @entity2 's quest in the 1984 film @entity3 , illegal dancing in the street has broken out in a @entity8 town as residents fight for their right to boogie			1
citizens of @entity13 , @entity8 , took to the streets in a ' dance protest ' after clashing with authorities over laws that require a permit to allow dancing in public			1
dancing without a permit could result in arrests for inciting a riot using laws that critics say infringe on their constitutional rights			2
residents in @entity13 , @entity8 kick up their heels in a protest at the city 's rules that require a permit to dance @entity34 veteran @entity33 joined the protest , holding a sign stating : ' i fought for freedom , including the right to dance ' @entity2 dances away his frustrations in the 1984 film @entity3 , in which his character attempts to overturn town rules that prohibit dancing the party - pooper law was highlighted last month when the town 's annual @entity46 party was raided by six police officers who informed organizers dancing was prohibited according to the fine print of the event 's party permit			1
partygoers were instructed via loudspeaker there was to be no dancing			0
as the other activities continued , officers stayed at the party to ensure no rebellious dancing broke out			2
now residents have taken to the streets in a protest - mirroring @entity2 's character in the seminal 1980s film @entity3 , in which he successfully overturns a small town 's laws using the only power of dance			1
@entity69 , the organizer of the @entity46 event , said @entity13 was becoming ' notorious ' for its rules , @entity68 reported			0
the town 's fight for the right to dance is mirrors that of the @entity2 film @entity3 ( pictured ) ' @entity13 has been notorious for a long time not allowing dancing			1
' they told me i had to be very careful how i handle it and when i go in and tell people , because if they dance or they get upset with the cops - i would get charged with a felony and thrown in jail for inciting a riot			0
' because it was being done on private property at @entity89 , to our knowledge and experience , we did not need to have any kind of special event permit			2
' this week residents addressed the @entity95 , before staging a demonstration on the steps of the city hall			0
dozens of people danced to the title track of the @entity2 movie , @entity104 ' footloose , as well as the @entity105 ' ( @entity107 ( @entity106 ) and @entity108 , @entity109			0
@entity111 told the council their permit laws were ' not right '			1

the law requires anyone hosting a special event must submit for a permit 30 days prior and specify whether or not there will be dancing			1
council bosses say this is to ensure organizers have adequate plans in place for things such as parking and traffic .			0

residents are *angered* at town 's laws that mirror the 1984 film @entity3
