@entity1 is closing in on a range of historic landmarks — winning his 100th cap at 29 puts him well within sight of @entity16 ’s record number of 115 @entity3 appearances as an outfield player and means he could ultimately surpass @entity20 ’s all - time record of 125			1

@entity1 of @entity10 in action during the @entity27 match against @entity28 @entity0 has expressed his fear about the level of responsibility on @entity1 's shoulders the @entity34 qualifier against @entity4 at @entity35 will be a celebration for @entity1 but having been made captain of both @entity3 and @entity10 in recent months , @entity0 says he will need to ensure the burdens placed on him are not too great			1
‘ since he has been made captain , i think he has taken a further step , both at @entity10 and with us , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the big question is , of course , as one of the few seniors left in the team , absolutely guaranteed a place in the team and the same at @entity10 , i worry the sense of responsibility is going to weigh him down			2
‘ @entity53 and the coaching staff do all we can to make sure that will not happen with us , but it is all very well telling someone to leave your problems behind and do n’t worry about them , to get on with your life ; it is easy to say , but very hard to do sometimes			0
@entity3 boss @entity0 will award @entity1 his 100th @entity3 cap against @entity4 next weekend the cap will make @entity1 become the youngest player to reach 100 caps at the age of 29 ‘ at the moment i think he ’s coping with it well but we ’ll have to keep an eye on the situation , as will @entity75 ) , to make sure it does n’t weigh him down			1
but until that time comes we ’ve just got to get on with it and be glad that he ’s doing the job that we as coaching staff want him to do			0
and ensure that the other players know their job so well that they ’re not relying on him to get them out of trouble			0
‘ he ’s really taken on this job as captain with enormous seriousness			0
he ’s studied and talked a lot with @entity91 , because @entity91 was in a similar position really : he had n’t had a lot captaincy before i decided to make him captain , so he had a lot of chats with him about what ’s needed			0
