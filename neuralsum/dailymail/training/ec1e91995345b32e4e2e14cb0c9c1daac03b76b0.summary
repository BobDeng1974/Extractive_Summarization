by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:07 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 17:57 est , 28 march 2012 a @entity3 oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in @entity6 has claimed @entity8 ' terrorism ' has arrived on @entity10 's streets			1
@entity11 spoke out in support of @entity13 , 45 , now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last tuesday			1
shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia - style assassination bid against mr @entity11 , a key figure in the @entity25 empire			2
@entity26 : @entity13 ( left ) was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near @entity29 in an attempted assassination			1
there are now also fears for the safety of @entity34 ( right ) who flew to her husband 's bedside in @entity6 at one point , the @entity8 authorities regarded mr @entity13 as a possible suspect because of an alleged $ 106million debt owed by mr @entity11 to @entity13			1
yesterday , 61 - year - old mr @entity11 claimed that he and mr @entity13 had ' normal ' and even ' friendly ' relations			1
' he was not a part of the assassination attempt			0
he had some information about how it was prepared , and wanted to pass it on , that 's it , ' he said			2
asked why mr @entity13 had been targeted , he said : ' perhaps because the people who did it were very scared of this information getting publicly known , specially given that , as i understood , @entity50 was adamant in his decision to make it public			2
' so they went as far in the centre of the legal world - i consider @entity6 to be the capital of the legal world - in prime time , to carry out this slaughter			0
' he stressed : ' my personal attitude to it is that it simply beggars belief , it beggars belief			0
how can you sort business issues by such methods ? it is terrorism			0
shooting : @entity13 , 45 , was attacked on the @entity71 close to @entity29 ' but i think the fact that it happened in @entity6 does give hope to believe that @entity8 and @entity10 law enforcement systems would together discover who did it , and get the b * * * * * * s. ' asked if he agreed that the two men named by mr @entity13 to @entity8 prosecutors - @entity81 and @entity82 - as being behind the mr @entity11 assassination attempt , were indeed involved			1
' i 'm scared to give the positive answer to that , is it up to the investigation and the court to establish it			0
but they can be somewhere there			0
' asked if @entity8 were behind the crime , he said : ' i agree			2
' asked whether he would now feel safe coming to @entity6 , he said : ' well , what do you do ? you 've got to keep living			0
' @entity98 blast : @entity13 is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in @entity29 @entity13 's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against @entity11			1
@entity13 's lawyer @entity104 has admitted in the mr @entity11 case that his client was initially ' suspected in organising this attempt on his life ' , because he was present at the meeting where property claims to the @entity11 family were talked about and where the @entity112 were threatened			1
' this is true , he was present there , we do not deny it			0
but still he is not in anyway related to the attempt on his life itself			0
' @entity11 , father of former @entity120 owner @entity119 , lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in @entity3			0
three @entity125 men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later , but police never identified the mastermind			0
the same gang was convicted of killing @entity132 , rivals to hardman @entity134 , @entity125 's @entity135 - backed president			2
ex-russian mp @entity132 was gunned down in his car close to the @entity137 in @entity3 in september 2008			0
his brother @entity138 , a @entity134 enemy , was shot dead in @entity139 in march 2009 by men using a gold - plated pistol			0
in november 2006 @entity8 dissident @entity142 ( pictured above ) was murdered in @entity6			2
@entity10 prosecutors have named his fellow @entity145 agent @entity144 as the main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium - 210			1
however , the @entity8 authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the @entity10			1
' the lawyer stressed : ' he clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on @entity11 's life			0
' it has also emerged mr @entity13 was preparing to claim political asylum in @entity10 for himself and his family			1
the financier 's business visa , which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008 , expires next year			1
it is thought the 45 - year - old feared he would be forced to return to @entity8 and into the clutches of his many enemies			1
he said recently : ‘ if i go back to @entity8 , they will kill me			1
’ last night mr @entity13 was under armed guard in hospital after being hit up to six times			2
with the would - be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the safety of mr @entity13 ’s wife @entity173 , 46 , and son			1
mrs @entity34 flew to @entity6 to be at her husband ’s bedside while their 25 - year - old son @entity177 is seeking a visa to come to @entity10			1
@entity180 yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the shooting to come forward			0
mr @entity13 was shot after being dropped off by taxi at his apartment block next to @entity29 on tuesday evening			2
the banker , who had been at a business meeting in @entity187 in the @entity188 earlier that evening , hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm			0
he had just stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets			0
the hooded gunman , described as white , 6ft tall and slim , fled on foot			0
a young blonde woman , reported to be mr @entity13 ’s mistress and the mother of his second child , was at his side as emergency services arrived			2
mr @entity13 's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a political asylum request to stay within days			1
a successful asylum claim would have helped him fight off attempts by @entity206 to extradite him on allegations of embezzlement			0
there was also an apparent financial wrangle with state - controlled @entity8 railways , whose president is an ally of @entity214			1
an estimated £ 415million was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a @entity3 bank whose ownership later passed to mr @entity13 and his associates .			2

@entity13 , 45 , was seeking political asylum in the @entity10
he feared he would be forced back into the clutches of enemies in @entity8
