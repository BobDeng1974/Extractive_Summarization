by @entity1 reporter published : 11:33 est , 12 november 2013 @entity3 : 11:08 est , 13 november 2013 @entity4 has officially been declared the tallest building in the @entity6 at 1,776 feet today			1
the @entity7 made the decision on tuesday after debates over whether one @entity11 's 408 - foot spire could be considered part of the total height			1
@entity4 had faced some stiff competition from the @entity15 in @entity16 - coincidentally the city where the committee is based			1
onward and upward : @entity4 towers above all other buildings in @entity21 's @entity20 and has now been declared the tallest building in the @entity6 @entity4 towers over downtown @entity21 as seen from @entity23			1
it is scheduled to open next year new look : the spire of 1 @entity4 was lit up for the first time on last friday rising from the ashes of 9/11 , the new @entity4 tower has punched above the @entity31 skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country			1
the committee of architects , recognized as the arbiters on world building heights , had met to decide whether the tower in the @entity40 or the @entity16 was the loftiest			0
@entity4 stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks and a ruling against the spire would have dimmed the significance of its height which symbolizes @entity6 's founding year of 1776			1
without the needle , the building measures 1,368 feet			0
what 's more , the decision was made by an organization based in @entity16 , whose cultural and architectural history is embodied by the @entity56 - formerly @entity15			1
tallest towers : @entity15 , formerly known as the @entity15 , in @entity16 on march 12 , 2008 ( left ) and @entity4 in @entity31 on september 5 , 2013 ( right ) topping out : the 104 - floor @entity4 beats out 110 - floor @entity15 - now that its spire is deemed admissible - and is shown in comparison to the world 's other tallest buildings ' most of the time these decisions are not so controversial , ' said @entity63 , an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit @entity7			1
the 30 members of its @entity66 met to render a judgment behind closed doors in @entity16 , where the world 's first skyscraper appeared in 1884			2
the question over @entity4 , which remains under construction and is expected to open next year , arose because of a change to the design of its tower - topping needle			1
colorful : the new @entity4 tower has punched above the @entity31 skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country			1
@entity83 has it ? to the point : a committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in @entity16 to decide whether a design change affecting @entity4 's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted under the council 's current criteria , spires that are an integral part of a building 's aesthetic design count ; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not			1
the designers of @entity4 had intended to enclose the mast 's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel			1
but the developer removed that exterior shell from the design , saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair			0
without it , the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna			0
according to the architecture firm behind the building , @entity115 , the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment			0
if the matter were n't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good - natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one - upmanship between @entity31 and @entity16			2
but @entity4 is a monument to @entity6 resilience admired well beyond @entity21			2
' i do n't think anybody 's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower , ' said 31 - year - old software developer @entity133 , who works across the street from the @entity15			2
' not only is it going to be the tallest building ; it 's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of @entity6			2
it 's a marvel of engineering			2
' from great heights : @entity143 , five , looks down from the glass balcony called @entity145 , suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the @entity15 's 103rd floor @entity15 ' we take our hats off to them out here in @entity16 and the @entity152 , ' said @entity153 , chairman and chief executive of @entity155 , the firm that manages the @entity15			2
' and we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world			0
nobody 's looking at this like a competition			0
' the @entity56 has a central place in @entity16 's history , speaking to the city 's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 @entity168 and its history of creating architectural marvels , said @entity171 , an archivist at the @entity172			0
@entity115 , headquartered in @entity16 , also designed the @entity56 , which opened as @entity15 in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 , had knocked it from the top spot			0
and the @entity56 can still claim to get visitors up higher : the highest occupied floor in the 1,450 - foot ( not including antenna height ) , 110 - story @entity15 is still higher up than that of the 104 - story @entity4			1
rising from the ashes : @entity4 , built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the @entity4 in @entity31 at the @entity56 ' 103rd floor thrill - seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as @entity145 that extend outside the building 's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet			1
in @entity31 , the debate was upsetting to @entity195 , a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29 - year - old firefighter son , @entity196 , in the terrorist attack			0
' you know what ? i think it 's a ridiculous argument			0
it does n't matter to me what height it is , ' he said			0
' you know , my son 's not going to walk back in that door again			0
and that 's the big thing			0

the @entity7 made the decision on tuesday after debates over whether one @entity11 's 408 - foot spire could be considered part of the total height
@entity217 lit up for the first time on @entity4 last friday - and it can be seen from 50 miles away
