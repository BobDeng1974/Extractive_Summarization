i was at @entity1 on saturday to see @entity2 comfortably beat @entity3 3 - 1 and one of the standout players was @entity6			1
it occurred to me that this guy has every chance of going on to be a @entity2 legend over the next 15 to 20 years			1
but could he end up being @entity2 ’s best ever left back , overtaking @entity11 , much loved by @entity2 die - hards , much underrated outside of the club ? that ’s a tough ask given the amount of success @entity11 enjoyed - he remains @entity2 ’s second most decorated player behind @entity18			1
he was a rare breed , as sound defensively as he was going forward , and i see both those qualities in @entity6			0
@entity6 was one for @entity2 's best players in their 3 - 1 victory against @entity3 the @entity24 international was full of running on saturday ... now he needs a long - term run of fitness @entity11 is @entity2 's greatest left back , pictured here celebrating a goal against @entity29 in 1999 it ’s hard to believe he is still only a teenager			1
but at just 19 he has the time to play more games than the @entity32 appeared in , and even more than the 602 made by another celebrated @entity2 full back , @entity34			0
there are just two things missing from @entity6 ’s game right now , and one of them – a long - term consistent run of fitness – could hold him back for club and country			2
@entity6 heard @entity45 ’s public criticism of his fitness levels earlier in the season and admitted the @entity2 manager was right			2
on saturday @entity6 played the full 90 minutes , and gave an energetic display up and down the left flank no problem			0
he seems to have learned his lesson , after declaring he needed to achieve a far greater level of fitness at @entity2 than he had at @entity55			0
but he has picked up a few niggling injuries this season , keeping him out of action on three occasions			0
it could just be bad luck of course , but he ’ll be keen to cut those spells on the sidelines down			0
@entity6 , pictured in action in @entity2 's @entity66 draw at @entity67 in january @entity11 pictured celebrating with @entity34 after @entity2 beat @entity68 in the 1999 @entity70 final @entity11 played more than 500 games for @entity2 , and was a favourite among the club 's supporters physically he ’s on the way to being a beast , and his ability is obvious			1
some have questioned his defensive strength – he makes mistakes like all defenders , but not a significantly high number of errors , his tackling generally looks effective , and his reading of opponents seems sound			0
the other area lacking in his game is goals			0
in 79 first - team appearances with @entity55 and @entity2 , he has yet to register a goal , and from what i ’ve seen he ’s not even looked like scoring			0
goals are not @entity6 ’s priority of course , and he should n’t be judged as a good or bad player based on the amount of goals he scores			2
but @entity11 weighed in with a few , endearing him still more to the @entity1 faithful			1
i like @entity6 a lot , and i suspect @entity2 fans already realise they have a quality player on their hands			2
if he applies himself , and stays fit , he ’s set to be @entity2 ’s left back – and probably @entity24 ’s left back – for many years to come			1
it ’s not easy becoming a @entity2 legend , but @entity6 has that opportunity right in front of him .			1

@entity6 was one of @entity2 's standout players against @entity3
he has every chance of going on to be legend for the @entity1 club
could he end up being @entity2 's best left back and overtaking @entity11 ?
goals are not @entity6 's priority but @entity11 weighed in with a few at @entity2
