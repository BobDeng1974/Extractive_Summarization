by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:04 est , 23 december 2013 updated : 18:51 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 have pledged to attack @entity3 after batsman @entity4 insisted their decision to attack @entity7 had contributed to the @entity10 spinner ’s mid-series retirement			1
@entity3 is poised to take @entity7 ’s place in the fourth @entity12 , starting at @entity13 on @entity14 , and @entity4 said he could expect more of the same after @entity7 was carted for almost four runs an over in the first three @entity17			1
‘ the best way we play spin as a batting unit is playing quite positively , so i ’m sure when @entity3 comes on to bowl we ’re going to look to keep scoring runs and put the pressure back on him , ’ said @entity4			1
on stand by : @entity3 is likely to replaced retired spinner @entity7 in @entity10 's bowling attack in the fourth test against @entity2 at the @entity13 in @entity13 on the attack : @entity4 says @entity2 's batsmen will go after @entity3 asked whether he felt @entity2 ’s policy of getting after @entity7 had played a part in his decision to quit the international game , @entity4 said : ‘ we ’ve played him very well this series , that ’s for sure			1
if we could attack him , that was our mindset from the start , and make their quicks come back sooner than they ’d have liked to			2
yeah , we ’ve probably played a big part			0
‘ hopefully we can have another big week here and then in @entity45 and clean - sweep these guys			2
’ @entity3 , whose own @entity12 career was in jeopardy during the summer , found himself having to defend @entity7 at the @entity13 after the retired spinner ’s ambiguous parting shot led to a storm which clouded his retirement			1
@entity7 said in an unprompted aside during a press conference solely for @entity55 newspaper cricket writers that some players he is leaving behind ‘ love themselves too much ’ and ‘ are up their own backsides ’			1
controversial exit : @entity7 delivered what some considered to be a parting shot at his team - mates as he announced his immediate retirement on sunday it was delivered with his trademark cheeky grin , he would not name any names and , as one of the seven journalists present , i can confirm that it was impossible to know for sure whether he was talking about his own team - mates			1
we know that @entity7 has never been close to @entity76 and that the two were on different sides during the text scandal that almost caused @entity76 ’s demise as an @entity10 player last year			1
yet on this tour they are said to have been getting along fine			0
and we also know that @entity10 have been angry at some of the more extreme sledging from @entity2 during this series , in particular from @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
@entity7 later used @entity91 to deny he was talking about @entity10			1
it was into this storm that @entity3 emerged , with the air of a man who was not quite sure what was going on			2
so @entity3 , do you all take playing for @entity10 for granted ? ‘ absolutely not , ’ he said			1
‘ we have a hungry and very determined dressing room that wants to do really well in these last two tests			0
playing for @entity10 is the pinnacle for every sportsman			2
in no way do we take it for granted			0
’ determined : @entity3 has had to overcome his own troubles to re-emerge as an @entity106 player but what about what @entity7 said ? ‘ it ’s the first i ’ve heard about it			1
@entity111 knows who he ’s referring to but in terms of the dressing room and his team - mates we are right behind him			1
we loved him to bits when he played with us and we all back him as a team			1
he ’s an iconic cricketer , a match - winner and one of the best spin bowlers in the modern game			0
’ how about the timing of his retirement mid-series ? ‘ it ’s his decision			0
he knew when he wanted to go and when was the right time			0
when you lose your own hunger for bowling or your passion you know your time is up			0
we are all right behind his decision			0
he ’s done wonderful things for @entity10			2
if i can achieve half of what he ’s done i ’ll be ecstatic			0
’ what of @entity141 , an @entity12 - winning @entity10 captain , saying this tour has become a joke ? ‘ i do n’t think that , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ we ’ve still got two tests to show our hunger and determination			0
’ but could @entity7 ’s comments tarnish his legacy ? ‘ he ’s done unbelievable things in the last few years for @entity10 and he ’ll be remembered as one of the greats			1
’ @entity155 rule : @entity156 , flanked by @entity90 and @entity157 , warm up for the fourth test in @entity13 knowing that they have already won the five - match series it must have come as a relief to @entity3 when he was asked about his own cricket			1
he has , of course , been @entity10 ’s top spinner before and , at 31 , has the time to be so again — particularly as the cupboard is not exactly bursting with young spin - bowling prospects			1
‘ this is a really good opportunity , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i ’ve been there in the past where i ’ve looked too far ahead and suddenly you ’re not focused			0
i do n’t see myself as the no 1 spinner			0
i just want to get my bowling in good rhythm — better than at @entity176			0
’ @entity3 said he thought his @entity10 days were numbered when he was cautioned by police over a nightclub incident that led to accusations he had urinated over bouncers			1
‘ i thought my chance had gone , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m lucky to be out here			0
i want to grab this chance			0
last summer ’s problems are behind me			0
it ’s time to move on and play with a smile on my face			0
’ just as @entity7 used to			2
only now it ’s @entity3 time again .			2
