by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 14 august 2013 decluttering , we are often told , is good for you			1
getting rid of your superfluous stuff does n’t just leave you with empty cupboards , it ’s a way of purifying your life			0
over the past couple of years , since my son went to university , i have been gradually clearing out the detritus of several decades			0
at first it was easy but now i ’m left with the tough stuff : baby clothes , childhood paintings and — hardest of all — old letters , which seem to demand a more dignified end than the recycling bin			1
a recent survey for the @entity21 claims that the art of letter - writing is in terminal decline , replaced by email and social networking			1
so it is a sign of my age — i ’m 54 — that having resolved to eradicate the bit of my past that my letters represent , i ’m obliged to dispose of a physical archive			1
@entity0 says looking at her old letters has been unsettling - but she ca n't bear to throw them away my 20 - year - old son , whose correspondence is vast , but entirely electronic , could delete the lot at the press of a couple of keys			1
it is strange to think that when i was a student , the only way my friends and i could make contact was by letter			1
there were no mobile phones in the 1970s , no email , no @entity49			0
so we used to write constantly : an endless stream of notes , all of which i seem , inexplicably , to have hoarded			0
when i decided to throw out my letters , i thought i had better look through them first			1
i had n’t realised that reading old letters is like time travelling — a journey over terrain that seems deceptively familiar but turns out to be stranger than you remembered , and more hazardous			1
plaintive notes from would - be suitors — ‘ where are you ? ’ — were all muddled up with brave , funny letters from my grandma , postcards from my tutors enquiring after undelivered essays , long letters from friends suffering agonies of boredom during the interminable university vacations , and reams of juvenile poetry			1
' it is strange to think that when i was a student , the only way my friends and i could make contact was by letter ' sifting through this pile of soon - to - be waste paper , i began , fatally , to read			1
and from the fragments of writing , a long - buried image began to emerge of the person i used to be			1
and i did n’t like her at all			0
this earlier me seemed selfish ( all those missed appointments with friends who had made the long , dull journey to my distant college room ) , lazy ( all those unwritten essays ) and unkind			1
the love letters made particularly painful reading			1
the youthful me did n’t strike me as someone who deserved the tenderness and affection that those letters expressed			1
' when you write letters you write your life story , and one rarely emerges well from the account			1
but it is the human condition to be ridiculous , and i may as well embrace it			0
' looking back from a distance of 30 - odd years , i know that my younger self was about to become very lonely and unhappy for quite a long time , and i ’m afraid it served her right			1
between the painful letters of my early 20s and the next batch there is a gap , during which the serious business of living took over			1
my friends and i survived the hectic period in our 30s while we were juggling work and children with our friendships intact			0
but for a while there was no time for letter - writing			1
we were like fogbound ships , hoisting desperate signals , ‘ i am still here — are you ? ’ , and hoping that we ’d still be in contact when the cloud of busy - ness and exhaustion lifted			1
when it did , something had changed			0
i had become a writer , and i began to get letters from strangers in response to things i had written			2
when the letters were kind and interesting , it seemed only polite to reply			2
by degrees i accumulated half - a - dozen regular correspondents — people i ’d never met but who felt like friends			2
and then there was email : the perfect hybrid of conversation and letters			2
it has been predicted that personal letters will soon no longer exist — killed by email and texts as surely as horse - drawn carriages were superseded by the internal combustion engine			1
but i am not convinced			2
we may think ourselves more emotionally spontaneous than our letter - writing forebears , but human nature has changed surprisingly little across the centuries			1
' i can destroy my half of the correspondence , but i can ¿ t make the whole thing vanish			0
if any of my correspondents has kept my letters , that version of me is out there on the loose , capering mockingly beyond my power to control her ' ( posed by model ) ‘ my dear @entity173 , ’ wrote the novelist @entity170 to her sister on saturday march 5 , 1814			2
‘ do not be angry with me for beginning another letter to you			2
i have read [ @entity177 ’s poem ] the @entity178 , mended my petticoat and have nothing else to do … ’ to me , that line seems as fresh as though it were written two minutes ago , rather than two centuries			0
like the correspondents of 200 years ago , we still crave scandal , reassurance , tenderness , news			0
@entity170 ’s letters , with their excited updates on the latest fashions and their savage comments about her neighbour ’s killer bad breath , may be written in ink on paper , but they are the emails of their time			2
what you do n’t get from email is the satisfying physicality of a letter			2
not many people of my son ’s age , i imagine , will ever experience the clutch of the heart caused by the sight of an envelope addressed in a longed - for handwriting ; nor find themselves unexpectedly reduced to tears when an ancient love letter falls out of a long - unread book that they have idly taken down from the bookshelf			1
you ca n’t fall asleep holding an email			0
or mark your place in a book with it			0
you could print it out , i suppose , but that is n’t quite the same			0
the way we communicate today means we 're in touch constantly , almost no matter where we are in the world today ’s 20 - year - olds wo n’t miss what they never knew , but i notice that i still revert to pen and paper when it comes to serious stuff like love and death			2
when i look through my old letters , i have no idea what i wrote that produced those replies of exasperation , tenderness , amusement or despair — and i find it disturbing			2
i can destroy my half of the correspondence , but i ca n’t make the whole thing vanish			0
if any of my correspondents has kept my letters , that version of me is out there on the loose , capering mockingly beyond my power to control her			2
as for my electronic archive , i could wipe my hard disk and hurl my computer into the @entity261 ( as once i planned to drown the letters of a faithless lover ) , but it would n’t make any difference			2
each of my email correspondents has the full record of our exchanges , and i ca n’t take a word of them back			0
it is a thought that should make me resolve to give up correspondence			0
but somehow it does not			0
when you write letters , whether by email or on paper , you write , without knowing it , your life story , and one rarely emerges well from the account			0
but it is the human condition to be ridiculous , and i may as well embrace it			0
i confess , too , that i may even be having second thoughts about throwing out my correspondence			0
while re-reading my 30 - year - old letters was upsetting , it made me think about friendship			1
most of those notes are from people i still know and love ( though who on earth was @entity292 , who wrote such fervent letters in the @entity295 term of 1977 ? )			0
the two people i loved best — my grandmother and an old university friend — are dead , and now that i ’ve seen their handwriting again , i ’m not sure i can bear to throw their letters away			0
but if i save those , what about the beautiful letter i had from a military historian , saying that my first book made him cry ? or the generous note from a fellow writer , praising my second book ? i was so proud to get those letters			1
are they really going out with the rubbish ? cupboard space is precious in a house as small as mine			0
and just at the moment , i ca n’t decide which i need more .			0

@entity0 says it is strange to think how she communicated by letter as a student
from the fragments of writing , a long - buried image emerged of the person she was - and @entity0 says she ' did n't like her at all '
it *'s* predicted such letters will soon cease to exist . but @entity0 is not convinced
