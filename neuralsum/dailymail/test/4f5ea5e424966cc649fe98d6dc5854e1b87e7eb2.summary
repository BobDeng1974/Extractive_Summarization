uproar : a petition has been started to get the spikes removed from outside this @entity24 's and 70,000 have backed the campaign but critics say they have been put in because they are uncomfortable to sleep on and installed on areas which used to be benches			1
@entity29 set up the petition to have them removed and has received support from across the globe			2
row : critics say the spikes were installed to target the homeless but @entity4 's say it is only about anti-social behaviour ' @entity39 spikes show complete disregard and lack of respect for homeless people who struggle every day , ' she said			1
' spikes have been installed , presumably to prevent people sleeping there			2

i can not imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless			0
' they deserve our attention and care , this issue can not be ignored			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity4 's said : ' the studs in question are not an ' anti- homeless ' measure , as has been suggested			0
