by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , 38 , pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of @entity4 , who blinded father - of three @entity2 in one eye when he was confronted after stealing @entity2 's son 's phone a father who was blinded in one eye during a confrontation with a thug who stole his son 's @entity12 has today been jailed for six years for stabbing him to death during the attack			1
@entity2 , 38 , pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of @entity4 , 29 , a serial offender described in court as ' a man of violence '			1
@entity2 was blinded in one eye during the savage battle when @entity4 stabbed him through the left eyeball			1
it emerged that the victim , who had a lengthy criminal record , had already been jailed for knifing someone in the eye			0
after sentence was passed at @entity30 in @entity31 a member of @entity2 's family branded the outcome ' a farce '			1
the woman , understood to be @entity2 's wife added : ' that guy was an animal			2
' @entity2 and three of his sons were originally charged with murder after mr @entity4 robbed his 19 - year - old son @entity41 - a politics student - at knifepoint			1
the grants used the ' @entity12 ' app on august 30 last year to locate the stolen mobile			1
@entity2 then left his home in the town 's @entity48 with @entity41 and his two younger sons @entity51 , 17 , and 16 - year - old @entity52			1
the father - of - three had armed himself with a knife to confront mr @entity4 , a decision described by defence counsel @entity56 as ' a huge mistake '			1
when they spotted the robber , who was not known to them , @entity2 ordered him to hand back the stolen phone			2
mr @entity4 reacted by horrifically plunging a knife through @entity2 's left eye , blinding him			1
severely injured , @entity2 stabbed mr @entity4 five times with the blade he had brought with him			1
three of the blows landed in mr @entity4 's chest causing fatal injuries and he died in hospital later that day			2
passing sentence , judge @entity71 said a victim statement from mr @entity4 's parents made clear that he was ' a loving and caring son whose death at your hands has left them , as his mother says , " broken - hearted "			1
' he added : ' nothing i can say or do can alleviate that pain			0
' however , @entity71 highlighted that there was another side to mr @entity4 's character the father - of - three had armed himself with a knife to confront mr @entity4 , a decision described by defence counsel @entity56 at @entity88 as ' a huge mistake ' he told @entity2 : ' he was a man of violence			1
he had ten convictions for assault , five of which were on indictment and included assault to severe injury and assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement			0
' but you , of course did not know that			0
what you did know was that earlier that night @entity4 had robbed your son of his mobile phone at knifepoint			2
' had he been caught it seems likely given his record that he would have been prosecuted in this court , the @entity30 , and on conviction would have received a @entity30 sentence			0
the confrontation between the pair began after he refused to give the phone back ' as it happens you had the means to bring him to justice because the phone had been easily located by the @entity12 app. ' all you needed to do was to phone the police and give them the information			0
however , you armed yourself with a knife and , along with your three sons , went looking for him			0
' the judge said @entity2 's lawyer had earlier described that decision as an error of judgment			0
but he told the accused : ' i ca n't accept that as a valid description			0
it 's clear you were prepared to be met with violence - or at least the threat of violence - and went armed to meet it			0
' all to often it 's said in this court that people take a knife for protection			0
it 's most unfortunate that it 's an excuse we hear all to often when talking about tragedy			0
' in the event the @entity153 has accepted that the violence you encountered was in their words significant and it was for that reason that your plea of guilty to the lesser crime of culpable homicide was accepted			2
' @entity71 acknowledged that @entity2 had lost an eye as a result of being stabbed and now had a lifelong disability , which had effectively ended his career as a delivery driver			2
he described @entity2 's conviction as a ' tragedy ' for his family and told him the proud educational record of his sons was a credit to him			2
he went on : ' i take into account you will have to live with the physical consequences of that event for the rest of your life and i have reduced the sentence accordingly ' nevertheless , the fact is you took the law into your own hands and went looking for a man you knew was armed with a knife armed with a weapon of your own			0
