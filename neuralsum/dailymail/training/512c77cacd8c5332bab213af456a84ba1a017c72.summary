@entity0 insists @entity1 have not received any offers for @entity3 and will not sell him during the january window			1
@entity5 , who have a long - term interest in the @entity9 international , have once again been linked with a big - money move for @entity3 but @entity0 has made it clear @entity1 will not be cashing in			1
@entity1 have endured their worst run of form for nine years and @entity0 is more concerned about addressing how they recapture last season 's sparkle than losing @entity3 in the coming weeks			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity3 ( left ) , pictured in action against @entity18 , is a target for @entity5 @entity3 has struggled for form this season after suffering a serious knee injury before @entity1 's first game @entity3 signed a new long - term contract in the summer and though he has only shown sporadic flashes of his talent this year , his manager has attempted to put an end to the speculation ahead of tuesday 's @entity31 third - round tie with @entity32			1
@entity0 said : ' we have not received any approach			1
this january it is vital we recapture our best form and regain some momentum			2
if our best performers get compliments , we enjoy hearing those compliments and that is good but nobody will be leaving			2
' @entity3 is someone with real passion for the game			1
you would always pay a good entrance fee to watch someone like him			0
but we are just concentrating on getting the result against @entity32			1
this is a real important moment in our season to make progress in another competition			0
' the players and everyone at the club are only thinking about what we can do			0
we have been through a difficult period of bad results and we need to make sure we fulfil our potential			0
that is where we are			0
this is the most important game of the season			0
@entity0 insists @entity1 have not received any offers for @entity3 and will not sell him in january @entity68 striker @entity67 ( left ) helped condemn his old club to a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity18 on @entity71 ' january is always an opportunity to see if there are opportunities so you can help the other players at the club			1
we have got a good group and we want to be ready for the challenges that we are going to face in the second half of the season			0
we are not going to bring anyone in just for the sake of it			0
' if @entity1 do sign anyone this month , the priority will be a goalkeeper as @entity88 faces another ' six or seven weeks ' on the sidelines and @entity90 is the only keeper with top - flight experience at the club			1
but the @entity31 is a more pressing concern			1
beating @entity32 , however , is likely to prove easier said than done			1
@entity1 have lost their last four matches in the @entity95 and @entity0 is wary of the threat @entity98 's side pose			1
' it could be a pivotal moment and that is the way we are looking at it , ' said @entity0			2
' i admire @entity32 and @entity104 for the way they have done things in the @entity95 , they have been phenomenal			2
@entity1 's players appear dejected after conceding the first goal to @entity18 at the @entity109 ' we have been disappointed with the results , because we had high hopes and expectations			1
we have got three games at home and we need to get the positive result that will trigger that momentum			0
i am very much looking forward to that game			0
' given they began the season with great expectations , @entity0 – who will again be without the hamstrung @entity123 – has found himself coming under fire from frustrated @entity125 but he understands why he finds himself under pressure			2
' that is normal , ' said @entity0			2
' we are here to win football games and build something for the future			0
the fans know we are all together			0
when you have adversity , you have to find a way of making sure you become a winning side			0
it is time to help each other and we will get our rewards			0
