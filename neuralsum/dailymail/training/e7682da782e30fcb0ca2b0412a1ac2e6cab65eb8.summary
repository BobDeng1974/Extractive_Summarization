chief executive @entity0 claims @entity1 are potentially the biggest club in the world			1
@entity0 made his assertion after contextualising the @entity5 ' earning potential at the club 's packed annual general meeting at @entity8 on friday			1
he claimed that the 40,000 season tickets sold for this campaign was only bettered in @entity11 by @entity12 and @entity13 , then told shareholders that winning the @entity16 title brings in £ 1.8million while claiming that clubs relegated from the @entity19 top flight rake in £ 65million			1
at a press conference in the @entity8 boardroom afterwards he expanded on the theme , claiming that , if the @entity24 champions had access to the sort of broadcast monies available to the top clubs in @entity19 , @entity1 would be peerless			1
@entity0 , @entity1 chief executive , thinks the @entity5 are potentially the biggest club in the world @entity0 ( right ) , pictured alongside @entity1 manager @entity31 , was speaking at the club 's agm on friday ' i believe that , ' he said			1
' if you go back 25 - 30 years and compare us to @entity12 before the media and tv boom , there probably was n't much in it			2
' i think our story is unique , it is rich - it is the best			0
' we have a potential fan - base of @entity24 / @entity46 diaspora around the world to support that and we have fantastic , strong fan - base in @entity24			1
' i do n't see any barrier if you compare @entity1 to @entity12 or @entity13 , the top clubs down there			1
' i do n't see any barriers if we were getting the same media values as they are getting regularly			0
' asked about comparisons with @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity0 replied : ' similarly			2
the media values in @entity19 will outweigh the media values or be similar to the top in @entity61 or @entity62			1
' therefore if it is a level playing field with our strong fundamentals			0
i do n't see any reason why we could n't be			0
' @entity0 joined chairman @entity67 and manager @entity31 ( left - right ) to address the media @entity1 chief @entity0 ( right ) took time to speak to @entity73 chairman @entity72 at @entity8 on tuesday in a more cryptic way , @entity0 suggested that moves were afoot all across @entity76 for clubs in a similar situation to @entity1 - essentially big fish in small ponds - to increase revenue potential , having earlier mentioned regional leagues or supranational leagues			1
' we are not alone , ' he said			0
' other leagues and nations are suffering the same problems and there needs to be a solution , and i think more than ever @entity91 are open to a solution			0
' there are no concrete plans , but it is getting to become more of a discussion item			0
' @entity0 , who hopes to convince striker @entity97 to make his loan move from @entity99 permanent , reiterated a previous assertion that the absence of traditional rivals @entity102 from the top flight costs the @entity8 club £ 10million per season			1
the @entity1 annual general meeting was held at @entity8 on friday there was a large turnout for the meeting , which saw @entity0 claim @entity1 would be peerless if they received the same income as the top @entity112 clubs however , he was unimpressed when reminded that former @entity5 boss @entity114 , currently the @entity24 national team coach , had recently spoken about the need to get @entity102 , @entity117 and @entity118 - all battling to get out of the championship - back into the top flight			1
@entity114 said : ' people say you ca n't manipulate it , but i think you have to get them back in			0
' however , @entity0 said : ' i love @entity114 dearly			2
he is a pal , but he is way off the mark there			0
we would never support that			0
' it is sporting integrity			0
it is a football competition and above all else you have to apply the rules , and to manipulate those rules would be wrong and there would be clubs who would suffer , as well as clubs who would benefit			0
' there were relatively few nods to @entity142 during the @entity143 , which lasted just over two hours , but @entity0 was later asked , in his capacity as member of the main board of the @entity147 , whether there was a possible conflict of interest in the shape of @entity102 shareholder @entity152 , who appears to be increasing his power - base at the @entity142 club while still the owner of @entity156			2
@entity0 said : ' i think potentially there is , but i am sure the @entity147 and the other authorities will scrutinise , analyse and do the right thing			2
