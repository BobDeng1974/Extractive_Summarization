by @entity0 centuries after he became famous , @entity2 's well - delivered lines are being blamed for creating stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease @entity2 was a master of insult , particularly when it came to a character ’s appearance			1
from ‘ foul moles and eye - offending marks ’ to ‘ a plague sore , an embossed carbuncle ’ , the playwright had a sharp tongue when it came to physical imperfection			0
and now , centuries after he became famous , @entity2 's well - delivered lines are being blamed for creating a painful stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease			1
the world ’s most famous playwright has been the subject of new research being revealed to doctors during the annual conference of the @entity27 of @entity28			0
researchers from @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , analysed @entity2 ’s language and found that it reflected the @entity36 obsession with perfect , unmarked , pale skin			1
they speculate that the playwright ’s status as the most well - known @entity41 writer of all time may be helping to fuel ongoing stigma around skin disease			1
for instance @entity45 describes his daughter @entity47 as ‘ an embossed carbuncle ’ and a prostitute calling a soldier a ‘ scurvy companion ’ in @entity54 part @entity52 @entity45 describes his daughter @entity47 as ‘ an embossed carbuncle ’ ( right ) , while in @entity56 , the deformed @entity57 ( right ) is cast as the subhuman son of the malevolent witch , @entity58 in @entity62 , a man with a red nose is described as ‘ an everlasting bonfire - light ’ and ‘ knight of the burning lamp ’			0
dr @entity66 , dermatologist at @entity67 in @entity30 , said : ‘ rat - infested and with open sewers , overcrowding and sexual promiscuity , @entity68 was a melting pot for diseases such as plague , syphilis and smallpox			2
' thou art a boil , a plague sore , an embossed carbuncle ' ( @entity45 ) ' thou art a perpetual triumph , an everlasting bonfire night			0
thou has saved me a thousand marks in links and torches ' ( @entity62 part 1 ) ' a pox upon him ' ( @entity88 ) ' i scorn you , scurvy companion ' ( @entity62 part 2 ) ' foul moles and eye - offending marks ' ( @entity93 ) boils and plagues plaster you o'er , that you may be abhorr 'd ' ( @entity96 ) ' @entity103 mole , hare - lip nor scar ... shall upon their children be ' ( @entity104 ) ‘ many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin , so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease			1
‘ this was not limited to signs of infection , but to any blemishes or moles , which were considered ugly and signs of witchcraft or devilry			0
’ in @entity2 ’s defence , he highlights the innocence of affected individuals in @entity126 : ' that for some vicious mole of nature in them , as in their birth – wherein they are not guilty , since nature can not choose his origin			1
‘ their virtues else , be they as pure as grace , as infinite as man may undergo , shall in general censure take corruption from that particular fault '			0
however , researchers say many far less tolerant examples can be found in @entity2 's work and it is argued that his success has led to strengthening of the stigma around skin disease			1
@entity148 of the @entity27 of @entity28 said : ‘ it is interesting to note that much of the @entity36 stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today			1
‘ over the last few decades dermatologists have tried to address the effect this can have on patients			0
in @entity104 ( pictured ) , a blessing to young couples includes the line : ' @entity159 , hare - lip nor scar ... shall upon their children be			0
' professor @entity163 , the director of @entity165 ’s @entity164 , believes the suggestion that @entity2 was to blame for skin stigma is ridiculous ‘ however , even now , many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice			2
‘ nobody is suggesting that we edit @entity2 but maybe we should ensure that new films and books do n’t reinforce this stereotype professor @entity163 , the director of @entity165 ’s @entity164 , believes the suggestion that @entity2 was to blame for skin stigma is ridiculous			2
he told the @entity181 : ‘ has any writer in history ever suggested that the symptoms of skin disease are attractive ? ' and have audiences for the last 400 years really been coming out of theatres saying " ah yes – i ’d nearly forgotten – pox is to be avoided			2
" ‘ what a genius shakespeare was ! ’ next week : has the fairy tale of @entity191 been creating a misleadingly favourable impression of dwarfism ? ’			0

study suggests writer 's language reflects an obsession with perfect skin
this may be because @entity68 was a *hotspot* for disease
skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for a contagious illness
but in @entity126 , @entity2 highlights innocence of affected individuals
researchers say many far less tolerant examples are found in his plays and that his success has fuelled stigma around skin disease
