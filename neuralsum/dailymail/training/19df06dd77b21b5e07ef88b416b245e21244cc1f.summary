a jobless single mother who flaunted her notoriety as a serial shoplifter with the boast , ‘ at least i ’m famous ’ , has finally been locked up			2
@entity4 was banned from 80 stores and had her photograph displayed on police posters after stealing relentlessly and terrorising her community			1
just two weeks after being made the subject of a @entity10 – a criminal anti-social behaviour order – the 23 - year - old returned to her old habits			1
' at least i am famous ' : single mother @entity4 appeared to enjoy the comparison made between her and character @entity16 , right , who was played by @entity17 in the comedy @entity19 magistrates were told that she was caught stealing £ 110 of perfume from @entity22 in @entity23			1
she also stole food and dvds from another shop and ignored a community punishment order by failing to turn up for an appointment			2
@entity29 , who has been likened to @entity16 , the foul - mouthed , tracksuit - bottomed character in @entity19 , has now been jailed for ten weeks for five offences of theft			1
at @entity23 magistrates court she was also barred from a further 120 shops across the town centre			2
yesterday one shopkeeper said they were relieved @entity29 had finally been sent to prison			2
‘ that woman has been nothing but a menace , ’ the shopowner said			2
‘ @entity43 ’s probably too good for the likes of her , but at least it will keep her from us – for now			2
’ @entity49 said the 5ft tall mother of three treated shoplifting as a vocation , bragging about her daily sprees			0
shame : bright yellow posters showing @entity4 's face were posted all around the area encouraging locals to report her if she flouted her @entity10 one boots store , in @entity61 , @entity23 , had been targeted so many times that staff even stopped putting make - up on display			1
she also verbally abused parents taking their children to and from a local primary school and tormented neighbours in the tower block she lived in before being evicted for playing loud music until 5am			1
in may , after a catalogue of complaints about @entity29 , police obtained the @entity10 , which differs from an @entity10 in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction			1
in court she was described as a ‘ prolific shoplifter ’ who ‘ on numerous occasions used language and behaviour that has caused considerable alarm , harassment and distress to shop staff ’			1
shameless : mother - of - three @entity4 ' treated shoplifting like a job ' , would openly tell neighbours she was off to steal and refused to work because she was better off on benefits the @entity10 barred @entity29 from the main shopping street in @entity61 , a primary school and supermarkets			1
posters bearing her grim - faced photo were put up to encourage residents to report her if she flouted the bans			0
but @entity29 was undeterred and instead toasted her @entity10 on @entity97 , posting a series of misspelt , crude messages from her new flat in @entity100 , @entity101			1
one said : ‘ heyy yah dont bring me down , let meh tell u f * * * ing hell least am famouse sad stupid t * * ts ! ! yah all whata leve meh da f * * * alone coz m8 u whata start playing games like dat			0
. ! ’ despite the threat of prison , the posters made @entity4 feel like a celebrity and she was caught shoplifting again just two weeks later in @entity22 former neighbour @entity114 , 55 , said : ‘ this woman has absolutely no shame whatsoever			1
she would openly say to me , “ i ’m going shoplifting today			0
” ‘ she was not ashamed about telling me			0
‘ a leopard can never change their spots			0
she will never stop what she is doing			0
‘ she used to wear tracksuits and looked just like @entity16 from the tv show			0
she ’s a little terror			0
’ yesterday pc @entity124 , of @entity125 , said : ‘ when she stole something , she would sometimes become abusive and shout in the middle of the store			0
‘ the jail sentence shows if you breach your order , what can happen			0
’ he added : ‘ shoplifting has a massive knock - on effect for stores and can really add up			0
‘ shops can lose thousands in a month and can close down through stock loss			0
’ @entity139 's in @entity23 was just one of the original 80 shops which @entity4 was banned from as a result of her persistent shoplifting			1
