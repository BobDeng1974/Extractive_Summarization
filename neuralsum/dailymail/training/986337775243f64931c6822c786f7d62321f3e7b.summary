by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 07:12 est , 26 september 2012 the married maths teacher who has fled to @entity2 with his 15 - year - old pupil had a new tattoo of a girl added to his arm over the summer - in what could be a tribute to @entity9			1
@entity11 's bold body art is of a young woman in a feathered hat holding a dog on a lead and was inked after their inappropriate relationship had started around seven months ago			1
stretching downwards and across his left arm , it shows a girl with long dark hair with a reddish tint - strikingly similar to @entity9 's own hair			1
he proudly unveiled his ' tatt ' on his own @entity27 account over the summer while on his school holidays			1
distinctive : @entity11 had this image of a young girl wearing a hat and walking a dog ( left ) tattooed on his arm earlier this year , which could have been designed to look like @entity9 ( right ) the other side of his arm is covered in pink flowers with a message in black letters that can not be read from his online photo			2
on his right arm he already has two other tattoos - a design involving red roses and also a star			0
it was revealed today that @entity11 and @entity9 fled when police started investigating their relationship last week			2
tribute ? the tattoo could be a tribute to @entity9 - as the girl in the body art has long dark reddish hair - just like the missing schoolgirl officers spoke to them and are believed to have taken their mobile phones but details of their investigation is currently being kept private			1
their school and the local council were also looking into it when they ran away on a @entity64 ferry			0
the teenager left her home in @entity67 last thursday afternoon after telling her mother she was going to stay overnight at a friend ’s house			0
her school raised the alarm after she and @entity11 failed to turn up the next day and @entity73 later caught the teacher ’s black @entity74 heading to @entity76 with @entity9 in the passenger seat			0
first pictures : these stills taken from @entity73 camera footage filmed aboard a @entity76 to @entity82 ferry last thursday show 30 - year - old teacher @entity11 with his arm round runaway schoolgirl @entity9 in one picture and walking hand in hand with her in the other - the last time they were seen the images of the couple on the ferry – @entity11 in jeans and tracksuit top , @entity9 in short black skirt – were made public in the hope of encouraging witnesses to come forward with information about their possible whereabouts			2
but there has not been a single sighting of the pair anywhere in @entity102 and no trace of them using their mobile phones or accessing cash machines , according to the @entity102 authorities			0
police have admitted they could ' be anywhere in @entity2 ' by now .			0
