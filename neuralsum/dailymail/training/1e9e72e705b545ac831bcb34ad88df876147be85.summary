by @entity0 published : 17:25 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 2 october 2013 @entity0 puts @entity2 's make - up under the microscope @entity2 in @entity4 is one of the last bastions of normality in @entity8 , an area of @entity10 that has all been colonised by @entity12 bankers , their rail - thin wives and an assortment of international celebrity / supermodel types			1
@entity16 like me are practically an endangered species , along with the jovial drunks and the old @entity20 entertaining passing tourists with his steel drums			2
the shop , which occupies the site of the old @entity25 's , is a stone 's throw from the likes of swanky stores such as @entity30 , @entity31 & @entity32 and @entity33 ; in socio - economic terms , however , it 's a million postcodes away			1
and yet , as i peruse the beauty aisle , i find i 'm not the only one with a @entity38 accent			2
' excuse me , ' says a middle - aged lady , her reading specs perched on the edge of her nose , reaching for a nail polish			1
' not at all , ' i reply , and we do a funny little politeness dance with our baskets			2
on my left , a young @entity48 girl pops a couple of nail art pens in hers			2
i am here because @entity2 's profits are up , way up ; and according to the company 's chief executive , @entity56 , it 's due to an influx of middle - class customers like me stocking up on cheap cosmetics			1
i 'll be honest : i 'm not a @entity2 regular			1
i am , however , addicted to cheapie fashion store @entity62 , so i 'm no stranger to discount shopping			2
but while i love a bargain dress , i 'm more cautious when it comes to cosmetics			1
quality , not price , drives my purchases			2
first on my @entity2 list is foundation			1
not much choice ( and nothing for darker skins )			2
since there are no testers , i choose the shade that looks closest to my skin tone , ' biscuit '			2
the brand is @entity81 , not one i 'm familiar with			2
i find a black mascara in the same vein			2
a brand called @entity85 yields three eyeshadows , a plum , a purple and a dark grey ( good colours ) as well as a neutral pinky nude lipstick			1
the ingredients are listed on the back : @entity94 , talc , paraffin liquidum magnesium , ethylhexyl stearate , and many more			2
not one for lovers of natural cosmetics			1
still , at least they 're being honest			0
' the ingredients are listed on the back : @entity94 , talc , paraffin liquidum magnesium , ethylhexyl stearate , and many more			0
not one for lovers of natural cosmetics			1
still , at least they 're being honest ' i spot a pot of @entity111 eyeshadow , so i bag that too			0
lastly a powder compact ( ' @entity118 ' ; nothing untoward , i can assure you ) , some make - up brushes , a @entity116 nail polish and a make - up bag			1
total cost : £ 10			0
the brushes are exactly what you would expect for £ 1 : plastic , nasty and they shed little synthetic hairs everywhere			0
the foundation is a different story			0
it goes on evenly , covers shadows and surface blemishes with a luminous , lightweight finish			0
the smell is quite strong , but it 's not unpleasant , just a little soapy			1
the concealer is a tad waxy , but it blends well and does the job			0
the powder is yuk : chalky and horrid			0
the pot of @entity111 eyeshadow turns out to be a disappointment , too : it looks like it 's already been opened , and there is a distinct brush mark in it			1
i do n't mind buying my china as seconds , but eyeshadow ? not so sure			0
' am i a convert ? no. but i did pick up some great @entity150 tat for the children , a new dustpan and brush and something to unblock the bathroom drain with ' the mascara is just about okay			0
@entity157 , mainly , and definitely not ' lash building ' , as advertised			0
as for the eyeshadows , they go on well but last only a few hours			0
the nail polish , meanwhile , has clearly seen better days			0
the colours have separated and the consistency is too thick			0
maybe a spell in the fridge will revive it			0

not a complete waste of time , then			0
it may have escaped your attention , but as well as apparently rejecting both bras and buttons ( see @entity181 , @entity182 et al ) , the fashion crowd are also eschewing make - up			1
go nude ( facially ) like @entity185 @entity186 , @entity187 , even @entity188 have been venturing out bare - faced			1
the thing about the no make - up make - up look is that it actually requires more make - up than the make - up look , if you get my drift			1
unless you happen to be a dewy - skinned 21 - year - old with supermodel genes , that flawless oh - look - i - just - fell - down - from - heaven angel vibe is hard to pull off without a little help			1
it depends first and foremost on skin tone			0
this is n't just about finding a good foundation ; its about keeping your skin in top condition			0
the @entity206 ( £ 125 , from clarisonic.co.uk ) may seem like just another fancy gadget , but it works wonders on all skin types			0
use it regularly , and you will see real improvement , not just in terms of breakouts , but also skin tone and softness			0
next , you 'll need a really good day cream			0
make - up artist @entity221 's @entity220 has just launched in @entity222 and on her website , www.charlottetilbury.com			1
this is the stuff she uses to prep the skins of fag - and jet - ravaged models , and it is truly fabulous			1
a tiny bit goes a very long way , which is just as well because it 's £ 70 a pot. the best and most natural - looking foundations are the ones that gloss over imperfections without stifling the skin beneath			1
i find that using a light foundation with concealer where necessary is always better than going all - over heavy			1
@entity241 foundation is really good in this respect ( £ 7.99 from @entity243 ) ; if you 're feeling flush , try @entity247 's sublime @entity246 foundation ( £ 38 from @entity248 )			1
all that 's left then is to add a pop of healthy colour to cheeks and a couple of layers of mascara			1
@entity257 's @entity256 is ideal for this , but to be honest you can just dab a bit of your favourite lip colour on the apples of your cheeks			2
trust me , you and @entity185 will be like two peas in a pod .			0

@entity2 's profits are up , *reportedly* due to their cheap cosmetics
