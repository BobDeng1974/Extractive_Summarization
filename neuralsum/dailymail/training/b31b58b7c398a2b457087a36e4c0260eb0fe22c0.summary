by @entity0 motorists are to benefit from a £ 200 million fund to end the curse of potholes which has worsened in the wake of the severe winter ’s torrential rain and floods			1
councils will be able to apply for cash to fund road repairs and fill in the holes			0
but while motoring groups and councils welcomed the extra cash , they said it would n’t go far enough and was itself likely to disappear just as quickly down a hole			2
motorists are set to benefit from a £ 200million fund announced by the chancellor @entity18 in yesterday 's budget			1
the money has been set aside to fix potholes that have resulted from the torrential rain and heavy floods this winter but the @entity24 said the announcement does not go far enough			1
professor @entity26 , director of the @entity24 foundation , said the drip , drip funding does not address the £ 10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified chancellor @entity18 told @entity32 that the flooding had persuaded him to make an additional £ 140million to repair and maintain damaged flood defences			1
but he stressed : ‘ our roads too have taken a battering			2
’ he singled out the mp for @entity39 who ad been ‘ a persistent campaigner for resources to repair the pot - holes in his constituency and across the country			0
’ and he added : ’ his persistence has paid off and i ’m making £ 200 million available which local authorities can bid for			2
’ mr @entity18 also announced a guarantee of up to £ 270 million to support the raising of debt finance for the @entity52			1
the government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the @entity57 north of @entity58 into @entity59 , if funding is matched by the @entity53			2
the @entity61 can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the @entity64			0
and @entity65 is also financially supporting the @entity68 enterprise partnership ’s transport plans in a deal worth up to £ 500million over 15 to 20 years			0
professor @entity26 , director of the @entity24 said : ‘ a succession of bad weather , including the recent floods , has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome			1
but he added : ' the drip , drip of funding does not address the £ 10billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified			1
‘ it is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for			0
this creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits			0
’ @entity90 , vice chairman of the @entity92 ’s economy and transport board , said : ‘ we are pleased that the government has responded to our calls for extra funding to tackle potholes			0
’ but he added ; ‘ this announcement does not go anywhere near far enough			0
' we urge the government to provide a full and comprehensive package , including the resurfacing of roads , rather than funding in dribs and drabs			1
’ mr @entity90 said : ‘ we are facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040 and there is a £ 10.5billion backlog of road repairs			1
the situation is getting worse every year because of a £ 500 million shortfall			0
’ there was relief that the planned 3p per litre september fuel duty rise was frozen and will not take place			1
but the chancellor resisted calls to actually cut duty			2
the @entity123 said the freeze on duty , for a fourth year , was ‘ very welcome relief for @entity128 drivers ’			2
but @entity123 president @entity129 said : ‘ the freeze still leaves the squeeze on families and businesses that rely on four wheels to function and prosper			0
a move to freeze the planned 3p rise in fuel duty was welcomed by the aa ‘ now that we know , from official figures , that inflation - hit earnings are effectively at 2002 levels and car use is struggling to revive , perhaps a short - term cut in fuel duty would have got the @entity128 properly mobile again			1
’ @entity24 director professor @entity26 said : ‘ the good news is that fuel duty has now been frozen since march 2011			1
' the bad news is that the @entity128 ’s 37 million drivers still pay the highest proportion of petrol and diesel tax in @entity151			0
' yet the stubbornly high pump prices mean transport costs remain a real concern for the record 18 million people who rely on a car to get to work			0

chancellor @entity18 announced £ 140million for flood defences
bad weather and floods has wrought havoc on the roads
@entity24 said drip funding ' does not address £ 10billion maintenance backlog '
move to freeze a 3p planned rise on fuel duty is welcomed
