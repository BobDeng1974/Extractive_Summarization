' the letter from the police describes discussions between the force and the newspaper over the story claiming @entity36 had run away from home and was seeking work			0
the 16 - page document – with key police and journalists ' identities redacted – does not address the crucial question of who deleted @entity36 's voicemails and gave her parents false hope that she might still be alive			2
last month it emerged the messages may have been erased automatically by her mobile phone provider			0

the agency said a @entity49 reporter claimed he was ' working in full co-operation with the police			0
' the force document explains that a voicemail message had been mistakenly left on @entity36 's phone by the agency			1
but by ' a pure coincidence ' it was not a message for @entity123 – @entity36 's real name – but for a @entity125 called @entity126			0
that message was accessed by the @entity4 , which became ' 110 per cent ' sure that @entity36 had run away from home and was looking for work			0

' desperate search : emergency services all joined the hunt for @entity6 after her disappearance on april 20 , the @entity4 played @entity9 police the message left by the recruitment agency on @entity36 's phone and three months later , two of the newspaper 's journalists met senior officers at @entity9 police @entity158			1
@entity92 , chairman of the @entity52 , said the police letter suggested that several @entity49 journalists were involved in hacking @entity36 's voicemails			1
@entity165 mp @entity164 added : ' of all of the documents and evidence that have been produced by our phone - hacking inquiry , this is the most sickening and exposes the black hearts of those involved in perpetrating and covering up this scandal			0
' last night a statement from the @entity176 family said : ' the release of the @entity9 police statement is a further reminder of the relationship between that force and the @entity4			2
' the report indicates that the police force were aware of a caller purporting to be @entity176 seeking information in 2002			0
