an understaffed hospital trust has hired 200 nurses from the @entity2 having failed to recruit any from the @entity3			1
@entity4 - which serves 612,000 patients – is also aiming to appoint dozens of nurses from @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 over the coming months			1
the trust , comprising the @entity11 and @entity12 , is one of a growing number using overseas nurses to plug severe staffing shortages			0
figures show that three quarters of hospitals are recruiting nurses from abroad and nearly 5,700 were hired in the last 12 months			1
experts say that as many as one in 20 nursing posts in the @entity24 is currently vacant which is equivalent to 20,000 nurses			1
@entity4 - which serves 612,000 patients – and comprises the @entity11 and @entity12 , has recruited 200 nurses from the @entity2 the shortfall has come about because the number of training places was cut by the government in 2010 meaning there are fewer ‘ home grown ’ nurses coming up through the system			1
in addition , hospitals are now under pressure to hire more nurses than ever before to care for the rising numbers of elderly patients who are very dependent			0
nevertheless it is highly unusual for managers to recruit such a large batch of overseas nurses from one country in such a short space of time			0
the trust has been under severe pressure over the last few months and has been struggling to cope with the high volumes of patients coming into its two @entity51 units			0
it was one of about 15 @entity24 trusts to declare a major incident back in january due to overcrowding and at one ward in @entity59 hospital , there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients			1
and so far this year it has missed the @entity51 target for treating patients in four hours seven out of eight weeks and cancelled 436 non-urgent operations to free - up bed space			0
the trust said the nurses had been appointed in december following a recruitment fair held in the @entity2 , in the @entity70 , by a private recruitment agency			1
it said the nurses had all undergone rigorous checks on their skills and ability to speak @entity77			0
but experts say the increasing reliance on foreign nurses is only a short - term fix as many end up returning to their home countries after a few years			0
there are also concerns that their @entity77 is not good enough to cope on busy wards and that they lack an understanding of how the @entity24 works			0
@entity4 was one of about 15 @entity24 trusts to declare a major incident back in january due to overcrowding and at one ward in @entity59 hospital , there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients councillor @entity94 , labour parliamentary candidate for @entity96 , @entity11 and a member of the @entity11 health scrutiny overview committee said : ‘ i suppose we can recruit from abroad but that is not sustainable in the long term			1
’ dr @entity101 , chief executive of @entity102 , says bringing in the @entity2 nurses would relieve the strain on wards			2
he added : ‘ we have also seen an increase in the number of nurses being trained at our hospitals as part of their degree , but there is a three - year time lapse			2
’ last month an investigation found that one in six overseas nurses are quitting within two years of arriving in the @entity3			2
freedom of information requests by @entity117 also showed that at one hospital , @entity120 , in @entity121 , all of the 14 nurses hired from @entity7 last year have already left			2
dr @entity123 , chief executive of the @entity124 , said at the time : ' the last couple of years have seen increasingly desperate attempts to plug the gap with more nurses from overseas , who have undoubtedly made a huge contribution and kept the @entity24 afloat			2
' some of the sums spent on recruiting staff have been ludicrous and the fact that trusts are not able to keep hold of them is a natural result of years of lackadaisical workforce planning in the @entity24			0
