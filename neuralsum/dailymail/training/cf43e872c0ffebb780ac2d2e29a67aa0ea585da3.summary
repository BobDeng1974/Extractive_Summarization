autism may be caused by a missing gene , it has emerged			2
a team of scientists at @entity5 set out to investigate the gene @entity6 , building on past research that has found some people diagnosed with autism are deficient in the gene			1
mice who were deficient in the gene were found to display symptoms similar to autism in humans , including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice			1
dr @entity18 , of @entity5 , who led the study said : ' in other respects , these mice were functioning normally			2
the gene deficiency mapped closely with certain autism symptoms			2
' this is exciting because we now have an animal model to investigate new treatments for autism			1
they hope this could help model treatments ( file pic ) the researchers also looked at how the absence of neurexin - ii affects the brain			2
' we found that the affected mice had lower levels of a protein called @entity50 - 1 in the brain , ' said co-author dr @entity52 , also of @entity5			1
@entity50 - 1 usually helps to release neurotransmitters - chemicals that take signals across the gaps between cells in the brain called synapses			1
lower levels of @entity60 - 1 mean the release of neurotransmitter chemicals could be impaired in the affected mice , and possibly in some cases of autism in humans , he said			1
previous research established a link between the symptoms of autism and neuroligin - 1 , another gene associated with carrying signals across synapses			1
the @entity75 - led study is the first to find a connection with neurexin - @entity6 dr @entity18 said : ' not all people with autism will have the @entity80 defect , just as not all will have the neuroligin defect , but we are starting to build up a picture of the important role of genes involved in these synapse communications in better understanding autism			1
' the study was published in the journal @entity91			0
people with autism may gather information from faces in a different way to their peers , which scientists believe could explain why they gain different perceptions from faces			1
the discovery could help improve understanding of those diagnosed with autism , helping family members , friends and healthcare workers better communicate with them			0
@entity109 researchers recruited 71 people , 33 people with autism spectrum disorder ( @entity112 ) and 33 people without the disorder			2
the participants were presented 36 pairs of photographic and synthetic images of emotionally neutral faces			0
they were asked to indicate which faces appear ' kind ' to them			0
people with autism may process information and gather clues about people 's faces differently , a study found ( file pic ) with the photographic images , the judgements of the participants with @entity112 were mixed compared to the participants without the disorder			1
but the two groups made identical judgments about the synthetic images			0
the identical results suggest it is not the judgement process itself that is different in people with @entity112 , but the way they gather clues in the first place			0
' the evaluation of an individual 's face is a rapid process that influences our future relationship with the individual , ' said the study 's lead author @entity154 , of the @entity156			0
' by studying these judgments , we wanted to better understand how people with @entity112 use facial features as cues			0
do they need more cues to be able to make the same judgment ? ' he added : ' we now want to understand how the gathering of cues underpinning these judgments is different between people with or without @entity112 depending on whether they are viewing synthetic or photographic images			0
' ultimately , a better understanding of how people with @entity112 perceive and evaluate the social environment will allow us to better interact with them			0

mice deficient in a gene called @entity80 showed symptoms of autism
this included a lack of sociability or interest in other mice
@entity181 also had lower levels of a protein called @entity50 - 1 in the brain
protein helps release chemical *messengers* carrying signals in the brain
now scientists have an animal model to investigate treatments for autism
other study also found people with autism process information differently
this is why they gain different judgements about faces , *experts* said
