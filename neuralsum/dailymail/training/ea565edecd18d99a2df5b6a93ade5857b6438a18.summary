@entity0 today mocked @entity2 's claim that he was late for an event because of immigrants on the road , branding the @entity9 leader 's views ' sewage '			1
the @entity11 mayor accused mr @entity2 of ' freaking out ' after complaining that the @entity13 's ' open door immigration ' policy meant that the @entity14 ' is not as navigable as it used to be '			1
mr @entity15 said such examples of xenophobia is like ' effluent ... something that human beings naturally produce ' but must be disposed of			2
he blamed immigration for there being too many cars on the roads to make the 180 - mile journey from @entity11 to @entity32 in south @entity33			1
he told @entity34 : ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here			2
it should have taken three - and - half to four			2
' that has nothing to do with professionalism			0
what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the @entity14 is not as navigable as it used to be			1
' in all these years in @entity9 that 's probably about the third event out of a thousand that i have n't made in time			1
' @entity51 last night branded the comments ' silly ' and ' dangerous '			1
today mr @entity15 said : ' of all the excuses i ’ve heard for being late , that is one of the poorest			0
' he told @entity57 radio : “ @entity58 is like sewage , it ’s a natural concomitant of the human condition			0
we ’ve got to manage it , we ’ve got to dispose of it			0
' it ’s like effluent , it ’s something that human beings naturally produce			0
it does n’t mean human beings are bad			0
“ it ’s part of the way human beings are			0
i think there ’s a natural sort of tendency to be alarmed about the @entity76 , the alien			0
' he stressed that @entity11 has benefited ' massively ' from immigration but he insisted : ' they need to speak @entity82 , they need to be loyal to this culture , to this country , to our institutions , to our society , to the @entity88 , to the rule of law – all the things that make us @entity13 – a sense of humour , and not freaking out about traffic jams on the motorway			1
' @entity9 held its first ever @entity95 at the weekend , with mr @entity2 delivering a speech to activists on saturday			1
but he had been due to mingle with paying guests at a reception on friday night			1
around 100 @entity9 members paid £ 25 each for tickets for the event at the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity32			1
mr @entity2 complained that the @entity14 , linking @entity11 to south @entity34 , was the ' not as navigable as it used to be ' but the leader failed to turn up , later pointing the finger at the number of immigrants using the roads			1
@entity111 , @entity51 's shadow welsh secretary , said : ' remarks like these are what makes @entity2 so dangerous			1
' it is clearly absurd to suggest heavy traffic on the @entity14 is caused by immigration , but through the laughter at his silly comments you can hear @entity9 's dog - whistle politics of division			1
' last week it emerged that @entity9 pays £ 60,000 - a - year for mr @entity2 to enjoy the services of a chauffeur			1
mr @entity2 told @entity57 on friday : ' you look at all the other leaders of political parties , they of course , all have the state provide them with , you know , the means to get around , and with security			2
the state does n't provide @entity9 with anything			2
' he said he had written to the government asking for state help with his security bills , but it had been refused			0
he suggesed he should be given the same level of protection as ' any former @entity143 '			0
' i 'm not having an argument over it , the fact is we do n't get help			0
do i need ( a ) security ? yes			0
and do i need to be driven around from place to place ? i think i probably do			0
' i mean , i came up here early this morning , i 'm off to @entity152 in a minute to give a speech			0
i think i do actually need ... so there is a team , there are two guys who are with me and take me round the place			2
' and if that 's being interpreted by one national newspaper as somehow i 'm now living high on the hog , in this luxury 4 x 4 car , all i would say to the newspaper that writes stuff like that is , come and spend a week with me , you 'll be half dead by the end of it			2
