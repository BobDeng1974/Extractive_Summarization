by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 09:11 est , 6 august 2013 @entity2 scientists have warned that seaweed could smother small creatures living on the sea floor on the coast of the @entity7 and @entity8 if melting ice exposes their environment			1
animals including sponges that live in near perpetual darkness , protected by sea ice that blocks the sun 's powerful rays in spring and summer but if the sea ice melts as the @entity19 's temperature warms up , they could be smothered by seaweed			2
biologists are worried that if the sea ice melts earlier on in the year , shallow - water ecosystems will soak up more sunlight and algae will spread across the sea floor , changing the habitat of sponges , tunicates and worms that anchor to rocks dramatically			1
@entity2 scientists have warned that seaweed could smother little creatures like this tunicate living on the sea floor on the coasts of the @entity7 and @entity8 if melting ice exposes their ecosystems @entity37 , a biologist at the @entity38 , which conducted the research , told @entity41 : ' some areas where ice breaks out early in summer are already shifting to algal domination			1
' scientists believe the early summer ice melt not only increases the time frame that seaweed can thrive under the sun but also intensifies the photosynthesising algae 's exposure to the light			1
creatures including sponges and worms live in near perpetual darkness , protected by sea ice ( pictured ) that blocks the sun 's powerful rays in spring and summer the summer solstice , which occurs between 20 and 23 june in the @entity60 and 20 to 23 december in the @entity61 is a particularly good time for algae to soak up the sun as rays travel straight to the sea floor			2
. the biologists said rays reflect off the seas ' surface and do not reach the floor during early spring and autumn , while it is dark during the winter , affording the creatures protection			2
the amount of sunlight hitting seafloor communities would therefore increase exponentially if higher - intensity rays could reach the bottom of the seas for longer periods of time , the scientists said			0
mr @entity37 said that if this happens it could cause a tipping point for ecosystems populated with invertebrates			0
scientists believe tipping points can occur with the smallest of environmental changes			0
a study by marine biologists at the @entity38 suggests more sunlight would upset seafloor communities along the coast of @entity96 where animals including tunicates , sponges and worms ( similar to these pictured ) stick to rocks on the sea floor if the sea ice melts just a few days earlier than usual it could transform the sea floor and change the habitat from an invertebrate - dominated ecosystem to one overrun with seaweed			1
in a bid to work out how algae might respond to more intense sunlight , the marine biologists studied the same species of seaweed along the coast of @entity96 as well as examining years of sunlight data from light monitors situated in the region			2
they discovered algae routinely pushed into regions with more sunlight and calculated that the light - seeking weed could replace up to one third of invertebrates living on the seafloor if melting sea ice exposed their environment			1
the survival of the small creatures is important as they filter sea water and provide surfaces for other organisms to grow on			1
scientists believe early summer ice melt not only increases the time frame that seaweed thrives under the sun but also intensifies the photosynthesising algae 's exposure to the light so as well as the death of these invertebrates , other species could suffer too			1
@entity37 said : ' a lot of fish and other invertebrates use the benthic [ seafloor ] invertebrate community as habitat and for food , so they are going to be affected			0
' the effect is slightly less critical in deeper waters as the sea floor becomes is too deep for sunlight to reach and could in fact benefit seafloor communities			0
a recent study found sponges thrived when a giant ice shelf collapsed , possibly because phytoplankton bloomed in waters and gradually sunk down to the sea floor			0
however closer to shore , the spread of algae is not good news for sponges and worms			0
@entity173 , a researcher in @entity174 involved in the recent sponge study concerning the @entity177 collapse , told @entity41 : it 's probable that the light will increase and the macroalgae will explode ... if they do , they will out compete the sponges			0
' @entity37 said a study in @entity185 , @entity186 has shown the trend occurring near the coast .			0

@entity2 biologists said some areas where ice melts in early summer are already being dominated by algae
@entity38 scientists said seaweed could replace one third of invertebrates living on the seafloor if their environment is exposed
the survival of the small creatures is important as they filter sea water and provide surfaces for other organisms to grow on
