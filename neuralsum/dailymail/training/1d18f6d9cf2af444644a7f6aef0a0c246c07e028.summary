by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:56 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:35 est , 30 december 2013 headmistress of @entity4 said appearing ' dumb ' is seen as a good way to make a fortune reality tv shows such as @entity8 is @entity9 and made in @entity10 are infecting too many classrooms with a ‘ culture of stupidity ’ , according to a leading headmistress			1
@entity4 said @entity16 ’s education reforms are being jeopardised because appearing ‘ dumb ’ is seen as a good way to make a fortune rather than working hard			1
she singled out @entity20 ’s @entity19 , who can not tell the time and is capitalising on his reputation for being dense as well as former cast member , @entity23 , for particular criticism			1
mr @entity23 now has his own @entity26 radio show but has previously been described as ‘ disastrously dim ’ after comparing his jungle experience on i ’m a celebrity … @entity29 to soldiers fighting in ‘ @entity31 ’			1
the headmistress of @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , said she was ‘ deeply concerned about the dumbing down of culture in the @entity38 ’			1
children ’s education and interest in learning face ‘ unprecedented threats from the ‘ culture of stupidity ’ all around them ' , she claims in her blog to be published on the school website this week			1
the mother - of - three said : ‘ at first , reality tv may have seemed ironic – a tv experiment where we peered in at others ’ lives but now it has taken on a life of its own and some of its stars reflect the education system they have been brought up in			2
‘ some children and teenagers see them as role models whose behaviour they wish to emulate and whose lives they wish to emulate			0
’ mrs @entity4 , 42 , described @entity20 - which @entity19 is currently taking a break from - and made in @entity10 as ‘ mind - numbingly dull ’			1
but , worryingly , the so - called stars of the shows are ‘ lauded for their lack of intellect and , in some cases blatant stupidity to the extreme of a ‘ culture of stupidity ’ being the norm ’			2
she attacked ‘ lazy ’ tv executives for ‘ cross-pollinating ’ shows , with @entity19 appearing on i ’m a celebrity … @entity79 , for example			2
she said : ‘ the shows and their stars become a touchstone to their young audiences – the watercooler tv for their generation			0
‘ they laugh along when @entity19 tells millions he ca n’t tell the time and revel in his ignorance			2
‘ what sort of message does this send to the nation ’s teens , the majority of whom are within an education system which is bottoming out in the world education league – about working hard and improving their own rigour ? she singled out @entity20 's @entity19 , who can not tell the time , for particular criticism ‘ yes the likes of @entity23 may have used the show ( @entity20 ) as a springboard for a radio career but what do they see and think about working hard if young people , many like themselves , are effectively making a living out of swapping tittle tattle and minutiae about their love lives and beauty regimes and making millions ? ’ mrs @entity4 described an ‘ erosion of respect ’ among children for adults as they mimic the behaviour they see on tv screens			1
she said : ‘ the reality tv circus has come full circle because the rise of celebrity culture , the bedfellow of reality tv , has meant that our children have started to mirror some of those traits and they have become less respectful to their elders and peers			2
‘ they ca n’t see the benefit of working hard which is perhaps one of the biggest challenges mr @entity16 faces in his battle to improve the school system			0
‘ while tv companies continue to make shows for the lowest common denominator to make as much money as possible , this culture of stupidity will continue to infect our classrooms			0
‘ these stars become like friends to them – they discuss them at school and they believe they have more relevance in their lives than historical figures			0
’ mrs @entity4 also attacked @entity154 ’s @entity153 - set in @entity155 - for encouraging children to aspire to be reality stars			1
the headmistress questioned how to make it cool to be clever when [ you have ] the likes of @entity23 ' who appears to be not very bright '			0
she went on to say that mr @entity23 must be a clever man as he used @entity20 as a springboard to fortune she said : ‘ where in the past this may have been a one - off documentary , this was presented as a primetime entertainment reality tv series , even with its own @entity169 special			1
‘ while i certainly applaud some of the inspirational teachers and pupils who appeared , i do have to question whether it is morally right to make reality tv stars of the children and their teachers			0
’ speaking about her blog last night , mrs @entity4 said many reality tv shows are ‘ damaging ’ the work of schools			2
she said : ‘ how do we make it cool to be clever when ( you have ) the likes of mr @entity23 for example , who appears to be not very bright , when actually , let ’s be honest , i think he is quite a clever man as he ’s used this whole @entity20 as a springboard			1
‘ he can make millions and millions and he does n’t have to stretch his brain			0
it ’ s okay to be dumb			0
likewise , @entity19 not knowing how to tell the time			0
that ’ s a real concern for me			0
‘ the target audience that are watching this are the teenage kids who are the ones expected by @entity16 to get their heads down and work really hard			0

@entity4 is head of girls - only @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35
she criticised @entity20 ’s @entity19 , and former cast member , @entity23
has *warned* she is ‘ deeply concerned about dumbing down of culture in @entity38 ’
