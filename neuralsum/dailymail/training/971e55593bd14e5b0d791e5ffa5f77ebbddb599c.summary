@entity0 intends to ' give it my best shot ' in the battle for @entity6 scrum - half starting duty against @entity8 next month			1
@entity10 half - back @entity0 is viewed in many quarters as favourite to wear the number nine shirt ahead of 87 times - capped @entity16 and @entity15 @entity14			1
while @entity14 has had to content himself with a regular bench role for @entity19 club @entity18 this season , @entity0 has been at the hub of @entity10 ' impressive @entity23 form			1
@entity10 scrum - half @entity0 is pushing for the @entity6 starting jersey @entity26 star @entity14 could be dropped having recently enjoyed a stronghold over his position the league leaders have been guided superbly by @entity0 and fly - half @entity30 , suggesting they could take their domestic partnership into the test match arena on november 8			1
' he ( @entity14 ) is obviously a world - class nine , ' @entity0 , 25 , said			1
' he has had so many caps for @entity6 , he is a @entity37 , so he is number one			2
' i am happy enough enough to come in , give it my best shot and leave it up to the coaches then			0
' there is plenty to work on			0
i know i have to pick my game up nother notch			0
' i am just looking forward to getting down to the hard work on the training pitch with the squad			0
' it is nice to be fully fit for a change ! i 've had a good run of games and got my confidence up			0
i am just really enjoying my rugby at the moment			0
' @entity0 , who has won six caps , gained @entity6 coach @entity59 's vote for two games in last season 's @entity61 , starting against @entity63 and @entity64 before suffering an injury at @entity66			1
@entity30 , the first choice @entity6 fly - half , works well in tandem with @entity0 but he now appears on course to reclaim a shirt that @entity14 has largely made his own , particularly during @entity59 's coaching reign that began more than six years ago			1
' i am really enjoying it , ' said @entity0 , of his prolific partnership with @entity30			2
' it 's good to have someone like @entity30 outside me			0
' we 've known each other for a long time now , and we know each other inside and out			0
playing together week in , week out is obviously good for the ( @entity10 ) squad and the team			2
' i know when he wants the ball and when he wants to kick , and i know when to take the pressure off him if i can see there is too much pressure on him			0
' i think with the @entity10 this season i have taken that ownership and taken the pressure off him a bit			2
' there is a sense of excitement in the @entity6 camp			2
' @entity97 is a long way off , but it all starts against @entity8 next week , so hopefully we can have a good training week leading up to that			0
' i think a lot of the boys will be frustrated with the @entity106 game just gone ( @entity6 lost 31 - 30 in @entity107 in june ) , and really have a point to prove as well			1
' head coach @entity59 has seen a number of his 34 - man squad for the autumn tests complain of injuries			1

@entity59 has some *interesting* options at scrum half
there have been calls to drop @entity26 *veteran* @entity14
@entity10 half - back @entity0 is next in line for to start
@entity6 kick off their autumn *internationals* against @entity8
