the loaded title , ' marriage is n't for you ' and the opening gambit is enough to intrigue the many readers who have shared it via social media such as @entity30 and @entity31			0
but @entity5 , a @entity32 , takes a very different turn to the one most readers are expecting			1
how ? well , what @entity35 is getting at is , his marriage is n't about him			0
' no , a true marriage ( and true love ) is never about you			0
it 's about the person you love - their wants , their needs , their hopes , and their dreams			1
selfishness demands , " what 's in it for me ? " while @entity52 asks , " what can i give ? " ' he writes			0

they were friends for 10 years before their relationship became something more , and a year - and - a - half ago , they got married			1
' the nearer @entity18 and i approached the decision to marry , the more i was filled with a paralyzing fear			0
was i ready ? was i making the right choice ? was @entity18 the right person to marry ? would she make me happy ? ' he writes			0
a conversation with his father put paid to any doubts @entity5 had about his upcoming nuptials			2
' @entity5 , you ’re being totally selfish			2
so i ’m going to make this really simple : marriage is n’t for you			0
you do n’t marry to make yourself happy , you marry to make someone else happy , ' @entity5 's father told him			1
' more than that , your marriage is n’t for yourself , you ’re marrying for a family			2
not just for the in - laws and all of that nonsense , but for your future children			0
who do you want to help you raise them ? who do you want to influence them ? marriage is n’t for you			0
it ’s not about you			0

@entity5 says the story has had almost four million hits			1
one commenter wrote , ' loved it ! after 15 years of marriage , and several near misses with that grey line in the affair department , my husband finally figured that out ... i finally was ready to walk away ... he would now tell you he was so wrong and not thinking about that other ‘ person ’ he should have been taking care of – our marriage			2
' selfless love : @entity5 ( right ) says it 's his father 's advice and his wife @entity18 's ( left ) kindness that made his realize what marriage is all about another tweeted , ' thanks for posting that " marriage is n't for you " article it changed my mind on that archaic , disenfranchising , and oppressive tradition ! ' it 's also received backlash from cynics for its simplistic view of marriage and the author 's relatively short one			1
' one of the most overrated institutions on the planet			0
only makes sense if you do n't have a will , ' wrote a commentator on @entity112			0
' marriage is n't for men , with the divorce laws , child support and alimony what man wants to get married , ' said another			2
' and marriage is n't for women either , because in most cases you just end up being a nanny , nurse , housekeeper , second income , etc , ' came the retort			0
viral : @entity5 says his blog post about marriage has had four million hits ' sounds like a nice sentiment			1
could not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first ... it can be a lot more difficult than you ever expected despite good intentions and a lot of hard work			0
people can be unpredictable over the long haul , ' wrote another			0
@entity194 responded with an article entitled , ' stop lying , marriage is for you , ' which argued that marrying someone you love because it will make your life better is n't a bad thing			2
