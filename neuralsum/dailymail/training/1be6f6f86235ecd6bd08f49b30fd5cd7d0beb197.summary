by @entity0 @entity1 is a photo series of old - fashioned , 50s - style glamour girls - dressed entirely in dairy produce			0
the incredible fluid shots are the work of photographer @entity7 , who specialises in working with liquid			0
unbelievably they are not created using any tricks or computer imagery - each girl is actually covered in pints and pints of milk to create the shots			2
dream girl : milk pin ups , created by @entity7 , in which dairy produce is used to create the ' dresses ' the photos are based on the pin ups popular in the 1950 's and have a fun flirty feel to them each picture is the result of numerous different shots layered together ‘ we work with specific light and pretty normal cameras , ’ @entity7 explains , ‘ there is no magic behind it			1
’ the rather messy shoots see a model , clad only in bikini bottoms , having a jug of milk poured over parts of her body by an assistant as @entity7 captures the movement of the liquid using fast exposure			1
each photograph takes about 200 frames and the milk is poured onto different areas of the models body for each one , captured mid-flow by the camera			1
these individual shots are then amalgamated using @entity54 into a single image , creating the illusion that the girl is wearing a single milk dress			2
the individual frames are simply layered - but not altered or ' filled in ' in any way @entity7 who also works with other liquids , says there is no magic behind the pictures , just hard work with each picture requiring around 200 frames , we can only imagine the amount of mess left after a shoot the series of photographs is soon to become a calendar the individual frames are simply layered in @entity54 and not altered or ‘ filled in ’ in any way			1
‘ it ’s tiring work but worth it , i want to stay true to the process , ’ @entity7 tells @entity75			0
