@entity162 , a @entity176 who came to the @entity16 more three years ago , introduced @entity1 to other @entity4			2

on the @entity10 's instructions , he went to more events at @entity129 , including when @entity6 spoke in may			2
@entity6 , 62 , is a prominent but controversial @entity7 imam who has attracted the attention of authorities for years			0
