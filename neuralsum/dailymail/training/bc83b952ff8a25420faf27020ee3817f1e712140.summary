this is the golden age of satellite surveillance , radar , sonar and advanced telecommunications and tracking devices			1
losing anything the size of a jet aircraft or a hundred thousand tonne yacht seemed impossible , until the disappearance of @entity11 last year			1
the doomed flight proved that things can go wrong - and missing - regardless of what decade you are in and explanations can be hard to find			1
the flight had been carrying almost an entire football team when it vanished and its location turned out to be many miles from where experts predicted , here @entity32 looks at some of the world 's most extraordinary travel mysteries , and whether they 've been solved ... the missing @entity24 football team it was 54 years ago - on april 3 1961 - that a flight carrying 24 people including eight top footballers all but evaporated into thin air			1
the sports stars were from the @entity24 team @entity43 and were returning after a 1 - 1 draw in @entity45 to @entity46 as part of the coveted domestic cup @entity49			1
eight members of the @entity24 @entity43 football team were killed in plane crash over 50 years ago @entity24 mountaineers pose for a photo on what they say is the wreckage of the @entity46 - bound flight the team and staff were spread over two flights and while one of the planes reached the @entity24 capital the other never did			1
the fate of those on board became one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in @entity70 and caused a national outcry as well as funerals for the missing players attended by massive crowds			1
this month it was reported that a team of climbers had found the twisted wreckage of the @entity79 , high up in the @entity20 in the @entity80 about 300 kilometres south of @entity46 - far from from were initial accounts and rescue missions had placed it			1
@entity84 ; a star player of the @entity43 football team who was killed in the plane crash in 1961 ' it was a breathtaking moment , and we felt all kinds of sensations			1
one could feel the energy of the place and breathe the pain , ' expedition member @entity91 told @entity49 's @entity96 , according to the @entity97			1
the exact location of the wreckage is remaining a secret not prevent looters			1
skydiving plane hijacker whichever way you look at this , it 's an impressive stunt			1
in 1971 someone known as ' @entity109 ' aka @entity109 boarded a @entity110 from @entity111 to @entity112 wearing a suit and sunglasses			1
shortly after takeoff he lit a cigarette , ordered a whisky and passed a flight attendant a note explaining that he had a bomb and was hijacking the plane			2
he demanded $ 200,000 upon landing and a parachute			2
the pilot radioed his demands and the authorities complied			2
@entity127 composite of airplane hijacker @entity109 who demanded $ 200,000 dollars then parachuted from plane a passenger named @entity109 boarded a @entity110 from @entity111 to @entity112 then held it to ransom in 1971 he allowed passengers to depart before ordering the pilot to takeoff once more ( with the money )			1
somewhere over the lower @entity137 mountains in southwestern @entity138 he parachuted from the plane to a highly dubious fate			2
@entity109 was never seen or heard of again despite the last four decades seeing more than 1,000 suspects considered			1
four years ago a woman came forward claiming to be the @entity109 's niece			1
she said she saw her uncle - a man named @entity145 - badly injured the day after the incident when she was eight years old			2
he said he had been in a car crash and then promptly vanished out of her life forever			2
she believes he died in 1999			2
the case has now been closed			2
pioneering pilot @entity151 on an ill - fated flight over the @entity154 on july 2 1937 aviation pioneer @entity151 went missing			2
on an ill fated flight over the @entity154 on july 2 1937 aviation pioneer @entity151 went missing the 39 - year - old @entity157 famed pilot was nearing the end of a record breaking attempt to fly the longest route around - the - world and had become somewhat of a celebrity			2
during one of the last longest and dangerous legs of the journey from @entity166 , @entity167 to @entity169 something went very wrong			2
39 - year - old @entity157 pilot was nearing the end of a record breaking around - the - world attempt when she vanished radio transmissions stalled , the weather was cloudy and she and her navigator , @entity177 , were running out of fuel			2
before takeoff they had tried to make way for extra fuel by throwing out every non-essential item , but it was n't enough			0
one of the last radio messages from her to the island was recorded as : ' we must be on you , but we can not see you			0
been unable to reach you by radio			0
we are flying at 1,000 feet			0
' a fragment from her plane was found near @entity195 , an uninhabited atoll in the @entity196 of @entity197 theories rained hard after the disappearance but the closest anyone has got at an explanation was when a fragment from her plane was found near @entity195 , an uninhabited atoll in the southwestern @entity196 of @entity197 , in 1991 , 350 miles southeast of @entity169			0
last year , experts confirmed they did indeed believe the aluminium fragment found was part of @entity151 's plane , used as to fill in a navigation window when the aircraft stopped in @entity209			0
some experts believe the couple may have landed on the coral reef as castaways and eventually died on the atoll			0
@entity214 in case you want to avoid it , the famous mythical stretch of @entity216 is roughly bounded by @entity209 , @entity214 and @entity220 and is the location where dozens of ships and airplanes have vanished over the years			1
a snapshot of strange occurrences reads as follows : the @entity214 is bounded by @entity209 , @entity214 and @entity220 and is an mythical area of intrigue in 1945 six @entity157 navy bombers disappeared , as did those who went to rescue them			1
before they vanished one of the pilots saud , ' everything looks strange , even the ocean			0
' on average four aircraft and 20 yachts go missing there every year			0
pilot @entity237 claims he inexplicably jumped 28 minutes forward in time and 100 miles forward in space here , and has since written a book about it			0
in 1945 six @entity157 navy bombers disappeared , as did those who went to rescue them in @entity214 area in 1955 a yacht that survived three hurricanes was found minus all its crew			1
experts assure us that most mishaps are due to weather and human error but more outlandish explanations include everything from gas deposits and aliens to ' crystal ' interference from the @entity258 thought to be somewhere beneath the waves			0
death ship depending on who you speak to , in june 1947 or february 1948 a disturbing distress call was picked up by multiple ships from the @entity266 cargo ship @entity267			1
it said , ' all officers including captain are dead , lying in chartroom and bridge			0
' this terrible message was followed by a flurry of @entity276 , then a final , grim two words : ' i die			0
' shrouded in mystery : a vessel believed to be the @entity267 whose crew suffered a terrible fate a @entity157 merchant ship @entity285 headed to the scene and found all its members of crew , including the ship 's dog , dead			1
according to reports their eyes were wide open and faces twisted in frozen horror			0
the ship soon after exploded and sank			0
no one has ever come close to an explanation but many have speculated at ghosts , dangerous chemicals and even aliens causing the bizarre incident			0
@entity11 @entity302 when it comes to recent travel tragedies , none is perhaps more so at the forefront of our minds than missing @entity309			0
en route from @entity313 to @entity314 on 8 march 2014 the flight carrying 239 people lost contact less than an hour after take - off			0
@entity315 acting minister of transport @entity316 attends a press conference of the missing @entity11 @entity320 vessel conducting search operations for missing @entity11 on april 4 , 2014 no distress calls were made and very little more is known about what happened			0
in the months that followed the world watched as a huge rescue operation began , spanning almost three million square miles from @entity328 to remote areas of the @entity330			0
based on satellite data best estimates place the wreckage somewhere far west of @entity320 city of @entity335			1
last year @entity336 estimated that $ 44 million had been spent on the hunt and that figure was expected to run into the hundreds of millions , making it the most expensive search in aviation history			0
so far search teams have not found a single trace of the plane or its passengers			0
in the following months a vast rescue operation spanning almost three million square miles was launched			0

despite satellite surveillance inexplicable events still happen in transit
from hijacker ' @entity109 ' to the @entity214 and @entity267
