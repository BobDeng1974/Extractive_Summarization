friends of the accused @entity2 bomber convicted of obstructing the investigation into the deadly blasts may be exonerated due to a @entity6 decision in an unrelated case			1
a @entity9 jury in july found @entity11 exchange student @entity10 guilty of obstruction of justice for removing a backpack containing empty fireworks shells from @entity17 's dorm room at the @entity18 in @entity19 three days after the april 15 , 2013 attack			1
but in november , @entity9 district judge @entity21 warned the @entity10 verdict could be called into question when the @entity9 @entity6 ruled on a case involving a @entity26 fisherman who was convicted of tampering with evidence for disposing of undersized red grouper fish			1
the high court on wednesday overturned that conviction			0
' i think mr. @entity10 has a very good chance of being exonerated , ' said attorney @entity56			2
' i 'm ready to buy the champagne but not to pop the cork			0
' @entity21 wrote in a november order delaying sentencing for both @entity10 and fellow @entity11 exchange student @entity32 , who pleaded guilty to the same charge , that both @entity10 's conviction and @entity32 's plea could be affected by the @entity6 's decision			1
what 's more , if the two face no charges , the prosecution will have no way to use them as witnesses by offering a deal			2
attorneys for @entity32 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
an obstruction of justice conviction carries up to a 20 - year prison sentence			0
at the time of @entity81 's conviction , his attorneys called the decision unfair , saying it reflected a high level of emotion in the city that was the site of the largest mass - casualty attack on @entity9 soil since sept. 11 , 2001			0
the backpack retrieved from a landfill in @entity92 , @entity93 during the investigation of the @entity2 bombing opened and emptied fireworks found in @entity17 ? s dormitory room neither of the two men were charged with having played any role in the attack , which killed three people and injured 264			1

he could face the death penalty if convicted			0
the case of a third college friend of @entity17 's , @entity40 of @entity109 , @entity93 , who was convicted in october of the lesser charge of lying to investigators would not be affected by the @entity6 's ruling , @entity21 wrote in november			1
attorneys for @entity40 rejected that assertion , saying they believed wednesday 's decision also made their client 's conviction questionable			0
' the decision will have significant bearing in @entity40 ' case as it relates to the materiality of the alleged false statements , ' attorneys @entity118 and @entity120 wrote in a statement .			0
