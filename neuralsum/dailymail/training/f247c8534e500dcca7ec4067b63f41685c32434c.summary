however , a new women 's t - shirt by @entity9 that is emblazoned with the words @entity11 , has offended rather than inspired			2
an official description for the t - shirt reads , ' we are n't saying they 're gold diggers - we 're just saying they 're out for the gold ! what 's wrong with that ? ' , suggesting that even the sporting giant itself is aware of the product 's potential to be deemed sexist			1
the company defended the design , telling @entity26 : ' @entity9 has consistently supported female athletes and the position they enjoy as positive role models			1
