most of us will have been caught out when our smartphone runs out of battery at the worst moment			0
but soon , taking a walk could solve this problem thanks to the development of an insole that converts steps into electricity			2
the @entity11 claim to provide two - and - a - half hours of phone charge from a one - hour walk - and they could soon be sold in shops			1
the @entity11 , which are currently under development and are intended to fit inside everyday shoes ( illustrated ) , claim to provide two - and - a - half hours of phone charge from a one - hour walk the insoles are currently under development and are intended to fit inside everyday shoes			1
they connect to a power pack fitted outside the show , and collects kinetic energy using a mechanism that converts linear motion - generated while walking - into rotational motion , which is capable of spinning a generator			1
the insoles fit into shoes and the wire is wrapped through the laces			0
the charging wire from the insole is plugged into the battery pack , which sits outside the shoe - either fastened around the ankle , or clipped onto the top of the footwear			1
an embedded mechanical system inside the soles generates the electricity			1
during the heel strike of each step , kinetic energy of the foot is transferred into the mechanical system			1
this uses the energy to spin a micro-generator			0
wearers walk for an hour to generate two - and - a - half hours ’ worth of power for a smartphone			1
when the battery pack is charged , it can be unclipped from the shoe and connected to a smartphone , or other device using a usb cable			1
the device is set to go on sale soon			0
@entity60 , head of business development for @entity11 , explained : ‘ our @entity62 have an embedded mechanical system inside of them , which is what generates the electricity			1
‘ during the heel strike the kinetic energy of the foot is transferred into the mechanical system , which uses it to spin a micro-generator			2
’ this generator allows power to be built up in an external battery pack connected by a cable , called a @entity77 , tied onto the laces so it sits on top of a shoe			1
it contains a usb port , allowing a variety of items to charge off it , including smartphones			0
mr @entity60 said : ‘ the powerpac is attached to the shoelaces , as you walk you are charging the @entity77			0
‘ when you wish to charge your phone , you simply detach the @entity77 from your shoelaces and plug into the available usb port			2
’ the @entity11 company is a spin - out from @entity95 , @entity96 , which received $ 60,000 ( £ 38,591 ) of money from a 2013 @entity99 campaign			1
while the insole is still in the design phase , the company intends on launching it ‘ as soon as possible ’			0
the insole connects to a power pack ( pictured ) and collects kinetic energy , with a mechanism that converts linear motion - generated while walking - into rotational motion , which is capable of spinning a generator the generator allows power to be built up in an external battery pack connected by a cable , called a @entity77 ( shown right )			1
this @entity77 is tied onto the laces so it sits on top of a shoe			0
it contains a usb port , allowing a variety of items to charge off it , including smartphone ( illustrated left ) it is not the first time designers have attempted to harness power produced by walking in order to charge devices			0
in 2013 , mechanical engineering students from @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity130 , created a prototype shoe capable of charging a mobile phone			2
their @entity134 shoes featured a shoe - mounted generator instead of an insole , which they designed to charge medical equipment in remote areas of the world			1
the prototypes delivered an average of 400 milliwatts , which is enough to charge a battery through what looked like a metal heel , attached to the back of the shoe			2
it is not the first time designers have attempted to harness power produced by walking in order to charge devices			0
a team of engineers from @entity128 ( pictured ) created a shoe with an unusual heel attachment designed to generate electricity needed to charge medical equipment in remote areas a @entity160 - based company called @entity161 is raising funds on crowd funding website @entity164 to put its leather @entity166 into production			2
it looks like a normal belt , but can recharge gadgets while they are safe in a user 's pocket , because the buckle incorporates a charger that is held in place by magnets so it can easily be connected and disconnected			0
the belt , which comes in black and brown , can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a usb cable and has enough power to charge an @entity181 6 from scratch or ' pretty much any device ' in around three hours			2
the @entity166 can recharge your smartphone ( pictured ) and other electronic devices while they are still safety hidden away in your pocket , so you never run out of power when you need it the cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt , which itself contains a new type of flexible battery , which its makers claim is the first of its kind in wearable technology			0
there are six overlapping layers of this @entity203 flexible battery sandwiched between the belt leather			0
the company also says that it is weather resistant and durable .			0

*ex-students* of @entity95 , @entity96 , *invented* insole
insoles have a mechanical system inside them , which spins a generator
generator allows power to be **stored** in a battery pack **stored** outside shoe
insoles provide two - and - a - half hours of phone charge from a one hour walk
