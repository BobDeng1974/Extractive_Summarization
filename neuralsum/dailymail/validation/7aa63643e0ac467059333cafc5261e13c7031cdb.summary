@entity0 was left to bemoan bad timing as the reason why he faces an uphill struggle to claim a podium finish in sunday 's @entity5			1
throughout practice at the @entity7 had suggested a top - three position was on the cards as he emerged the closest rival to @entity12 duo @entity11 and @entity13			1
but come qualifying , and the start of the second session with a storm brewing overhead , the @entity14 found himself out of position in the queue to take to the track and set a banker lap. @entity0 's chances of a podium finish in @entity24 were dampened by a storm during qualifying the @entity14 eventually qualified in 11th position in his @entity28 at the @entity29 click here to read @entity32 's report as @entity11 secures pole ahead of @entity33 and @entity13 with team - mate @entity33 at the head of the line of cars , the four - times champion eventually emerged quickest in @entity38 as the drivers only had time for one hot lap before the heavens opened			1
that lap proved to be a mad scramble from which @entity0 could only qualify 11th , with @entity45 's @entity44 his undoing			1
' i tried to overtake @entity48 because he was in front of me , ' said @entity0			1
' but at the last corner i could n't slow down because there were other people pushing me forward			2
' in my mind we just got the timing wrong			2
that 's how it ended up			2
' television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit dark clouds gather in the background at the @entity7 during the qualifying session @entity0 , though , opted not to point an accusing finger at his team , adding : ' i do n't know if it helps to blame anyone			1
' it 's easy to say afterwards we should have been waiting behind one another , but the end result is this and whatever we will do now will not change it			2
' obviously , we have made our life very difficult , so i have no idea what we will do tomorrow			2
we will try our best and see where we end up			2
' @entity33 , meanwhile , became the first @entity28 driver since this race two years ago to qualify on the front row , splitting @entity11 and @entity13 who were denied a 10th consecutive front - row lock - out			1
world champion @entity11 will begin the @entity24 @entity5 at @entity7 on pole position @entity33 ( right ) split the @entity12 drivers to put his @entity28 second on the grid in @entity24 with further rain forecast for the race , the outcome could be wide open , potentially playing into @entity33 's hands as his car appeared strong in the wet			1
' obviously when it starts to rain here - and there 's always a high chance - it can mix up things , ' said @entity33			1
' it was an interesting qualifying session			2
the car felt good in both dry and wet conditions at the end			0
' i 'm reasonably happy , and also the long runs look good on practice days , so we should be in good shape , but we know they ( @entity12 ) are difficult to beat			0
' that 's ultimately why we turn up trying to win , so we will see what we can do			2
maybe it looks like we are a little bit closer here , but we will have to wait and see			0
