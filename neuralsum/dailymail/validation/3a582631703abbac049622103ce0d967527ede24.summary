airline food does not have the best reputation			2
from stodgy meals to unrecognisable dishes , it seems everyone has a horror story about being served up inedible food on flights			2
and some even go as far as taking a picture of their unappetising snack and uploading it to the website @entity12 to warn others about the questionable dishes			0
this @entity22 roll from @entity23 to @entity24 in october 2014 was not met with happiness this offering from @entity27 did not go down a treat			0
while we are a fan of cheese , @entity27 have created a swimming pool of cheesy sauce for the limp burger when @entity35 decided to serve this sun dried tomato sandwich , they were met with horror by the flying customer , who had to put it back in the bag unappetising : this @entity44 selection failed to impress the customer who received it , although at least there was a variety of choices unhappy with @entity50			2
this disgruntled passenger rated gave this dry ' scanty sandwich ' a 1/10 rating on the site			2
not the most appetising sandwich we have seen you would be forgiven from thinking this slimy peach dessert was a slug			0
it is fact the dish on offer onboard a @entity65 flight from ' toxic ' salad to pasta that looks three days old and even ' untouchable ' fish dishes , the hall of shame seems almost unending and will soon have you reaching for the sick bag			1
@entity17 was created over ten years ago , by @entity73 and allows users to upload their food and rate it out of ten			1
there are now over 34,000 pictures on the site , covering 680 airlines from every corner of the globe			1
some of the uploads are singing the praises of the dishes and others shouting their displeasure			0
' t @entity73 said he created the site after his mother asked what plane food he had when he travelled between @entity90 and @entity91 to see his girlfriend			1
he started the website with his photographs , and added some from other fliers , with their permission			0
soon he had millions of views and thousands of uploaded meals			0
' we used the lowest ratings for a while ... that used to be fun , but we now focus on the quality airlines offer			2
we need friends within the industry , not enemies , ' he said			0
despite this focus , @entity17 still shows the contributor 's score out of ten and honest comments			1
@entity114 's @entity113 served this burger , with a few sad - looking leaves of lettuce , to an unhappy victim on a flight this @entity124 meal , with the meat tossed on top of a watery sauce , looks less than appealing for the consumer this @entity127 dish served in december 2014 appears to be missing a few ingredients , although at least they have tried to garnish it with some decorative parsley the mother of the boy who received this pancake onboard a @entity135 flight ( @entity135 ) said he called it ' gross ' and refused to eat it - we are n't sure we would eat it either ! this @entity143 bland ham and cheese sandwich gained a 5/10 on the site and was described as ' nothing special ' the @entity17 creator said that usually the bigger airlines from the @entity148 , ( @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 ) and the @entity152 ( all @entity153 , @entity154 ) get the best scores			1
in @entity160 , some of the smaller airlines , such as @entity158 , and larger @entity160 airlines including @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity135 , @entity163 , @entity164 , hold their own on the site too			1
in december , @entity24 - based @entity167 revealed the results of a survey about airline food showing @entity171 was the best for nutrition , followed by @entity174 and @entity175			1
@entity27 served this disappointing meatball sub to a guest , who promptly uploaded to name and shame the airline @entity180 : ' this was the most disgusting and bland meal i have ever tried to eat on an aircraft			0
the egg was gross , the beef was dry and flavourless and the salad smelled toxic			1
i only ate the cake which was decent ' the user who tried this dish with @entity190 described this green tinged mashed potato as ' ugly ' @entity192 served this ' cold and tasteless ' dish of glass noodle salad with shrimp on its flight from @entity197 to @entity198 to the dismay of a queasy guest ' the appetiser is untouchable ... smoked marlin with @entity204 endives , baby green and capsicum , ' said the uploader of this oily dish who flew with @entity210 a customer onboard a @entity213 flight was not happy with his frozen gouda sandwich , on his flight between @entity216 and @entity24 elaborate dining with @entity50 : the recipient probably had other expectations in mind when they selected the cheese and biscuits spread , and gave the food 1/10 for taste and quality			1
' the pasta was like three days old ' according to one @entity228 user who tried this dry , bland dish on their flight from @entity232 to @entity216 in 2015 however , clearly airlines still have a long way to go to make their meals palatable			1
a user on board a @entity180 flight posted an image on @entity241 writing : ' this was the most disgusting and bland meal i have ever tried to eat on an aircraft			0
the egg was gross , the beef was dry and flavourless and the salad smelled toxic			1
i only ate the cake which was decent			0
' another flier with @entity210 described the appetiser as ' untouchable ' and ' cheap			2
' one guest aboard a @entity252 flight echoed this in their review and said the ' dry fish ' was ' bordering inedible			0
' this @entity252 dry fish was described by the user as ' bordering inedible ' , during a flight from @entity260 ( @entity261 ) to @entity262 ( @entity263 ) , 26 oct 2014 a man on an @entity265 was confused his omelette had been served with limp mushrooms and ... crisps ?			0
