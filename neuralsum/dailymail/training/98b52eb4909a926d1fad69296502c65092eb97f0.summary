@entity0 and @entity1 in the 1992 film adaptation of @entity3 's @entity4 , which is set to be dropped from the @entity7 syllabus @entity9 literary classics are to be dropped from @entity11 literature gcses under plans that have triggered a backlash against @entity14			1
to kill a mockingbird by @entity16 and @entity3 ’s @entity4 are among the @entity9 novels being ditched by an exam board , along with the @entity19 play @entity20			1
the @entity22 board said it had taken the decision because of the @entity25 ’s desire for the exam to be ‘ more focused on tradition ’ and because there were fewer opportunities to include @entity9 texts on the new @entity32 - dominated syllabus			1
but the decision has sparked a storm of protest , with complaints on @entity37 and thousands signing a series of online petitions to keep @entity9 classics on gcse syllabuses			1
authors , academics and booksellers have condemned the shake - up , with some describing it as ‘ backward - looking ’ and a traditionalist attempt to reinstate the idea of a ‘ canon ’ of @entity11 literature			1
the @entity51 has insisted that its document about content for the subject , published in december , ‘ does n’t ban any authors , books or genres ’			0
the new gcse course will include at least one play by @entity60 , at least one 19th century novel , a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative romantic poetry and ‘ fiction or drama from the @entity67 from 1914 onwards ’			0
exam boards can add extra books , but experts say the rules leave very little room for 20th century writing outside @entity32			0
@entity73 , @entity22 ’s head of gcse and a-level reform , said in an interview : ‘ @entity4 , which @entity14 really dislikes , will not be included			2
' it was studied by 90 per cent of teenagers taking @entity11 literature gcse in the past			1
@entity14 said that was a really disappointing statistic			2
’ yesterday he criticised the @entity51 ‘ restrictions ’ , saying : ‘ the essential thing is that in the new gcse you can not do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is @entity32			0
’ one online petition , signed by 2,567 , states : ‘ modern texts from outside the @entity32 are equally , if not more , important as @entity32 texts			0
’ children ’s laureate @entity94 said on @entity37 : ‘ surely diversity in the curriculum is vital to encourage more extended reading and to expand our teens ’ minds ? ’ @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , tweeted : ‘ do n’t be alarmed if we put your copy of @entity106 in a brown bag			0
we hear @entity14 might be doing spot checks			0
’ @entity20 , which was adapted into a film featuring @entity110 and @entity111 , is another text being dropped by exam board @entity22 due to @entity14 's desire for the exam to be ' more focused on tradition ' @entity117 , chairman of the @entity118 , described the new syllabus as being ‘ out of the 1940s ’			1
she said : ‘ kids will be put off doing @entity123 literature by this			0
’ the country ’s exam boards must submit their gcse @entity11 literature specifications to regulator @entity128 this week for accreditation			1
it is understood that @entity132 ’s play @entity131 is on one exam board ’s syllabus			2
a spokesman for @entity136 said it was still finalising its @entity139 gcse specification			0
@entity140 , the other main exam board , has yet to reveal its specifications			2
a @entity51 spokesman said : ‘ in the past , @entity11 literature gcses were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow			2
