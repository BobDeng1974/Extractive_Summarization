manager @entity0 has declared ' business as usual ' at @entity2 despite owner @entity4 's revelations that the club has been up for sale since april			1
@entity4 announced on thursday that he put @entity2 on the market on april 10 , less than a day after the @entity8 rejected his proposals the rename the team @entity2			2
the @entity10 has also set in motion an appeal against that decision with the @entity14 and will stay in charge if successful			1
@entity4 announced that he is trying to sell @entity2 after the @entity16 rejected his attempted name change that seems to point towards a period of instability at the @entity21 as both issues rumble on but @entity0 insists nothing has changed from a footballing perspective			1
the manager has been aware of @entity4 's moves at every stage and remains convinced that going through with a sale remains a last resort for the outspoken 75 - year - old			1
' deep down i know for a fact he does n't really want to sell it but he feels that passionately about it ( the @entity2 rebrand ) that we have to respect it , ' said @entity0			1
' i think for all of us here nothing has really changed , he 's just reiterated his beliefs			0
' so for me it 's business as usual			0
it 's been hanging around us now for six months			0
' there was all sorts of rumours flying around that he 'd already sold it and we all know the situation now			0
let 's get on with playing football and waiting for the @entity14 decision because i think that 's going to be months away from what i can gather			1
' it is business as usual for @entity0 who says the owner 's views must be respected for @entity0 , it all means a second straight season of fighting off - field fires while also keeping the team afloat in the @entity64			2
the @entity2 row raged throughout last season , yet @entity0 managed to lead the side to a first fa cup final as well as a best ever league position			0
part of the reason he is able to keep the show on the road may lie in the fact that he finds himself able to see both sides of the argument			0
' we 're all a little bit wary in this country of change because we 're all huge traditionalists and so am i , ' he said			0
' but he ( @entity4 ) feels passionately that the club can move forward with a name change and that you have to respect			1
and of course the one thing we have to do when there is an argument is respect both sides			0
many @entity2 fans oppose the name change but @entity4 is adamant that it must happen of he will leave ' in @entity91 we are wary of change , but i never thought 20 - odd years ago that the big clubs would break away from the @entity95 and create the @entity64			1
i never thought @entity96 would leave @entity97 and play at the @entity98			0
' it 's a difficult situation i find myself in always , but we all want one thing : for the club to get bigger and better and succeed			2
i hope the supporters will respect that there is an argument going on and find a middle ground			2
' supporters ' group @entity106 , who had led protests against the name change , have made their response to @entity4 's latest outpourings			1
@entity4 spent heavily on the team this summer bringing in @entity114 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) they remain steadfastly against ditching the 110 - year - old moniker of @entity2 but also respectful of @entity4 's commitment to financing @entity0 's transfer plans			1
a statement from the group read : ' @entity106 is disappointed to learn that chairman dr. @entity4 intends to appeal to the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
' @entity2 has enjoyed a period of relative stability since the @entity16 turned down the name change application after a thorough and fair process			0
' ctwd continue to support the @entity127 ' ownership of the club			2
we remain grateful that in 2010 they secured the future of the club when it was uncertain and we appreciate their positive contributions to the club 's history in the four years since			0
' however we still see no justifiable reason to change the name of a football club that has existed and been a pillar of the local community since 1904 and we know that a significant number of the club 's fans agree			2
' @entity145 could make his debut for @entity2 against @entity147 this weekend but is unlikely to start			0

@entity4 says he will give the club away if he can not find a buyer
but @entity0 maintains ' he does n't really want to sell '
decision over name will go to @entity14
supporters ' group @entity157 we die continue to oppose the change
@entity106 say they support @entity4 's leadership and hope he stays but insist the name should stay
