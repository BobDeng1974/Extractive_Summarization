@entity1 's poor performance in this season 's @entity2 has dealt the @entity5 club a seedings blow for the @entity8 last - 32 draw			1
as a result of being one of the four worst performing third - placed teams , @entity10 ' side are unseeded for the draw , which will be held in @entity15 on monday at noon			1
the @entity8 has added importance this season with the winners receiving entry to next season 's @entity2			0
@entity10 shows his frustrations as his @entity1 side are knocked out of the @entity2 @entity1 captain @entity23 looks dejected as the @entity5 club draw against @entity24 on tuesday seeded : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 unseeded : @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity1 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 * the full seedings will be confirmed after the completion of thursday 's @entity8 group stage matches and with @entity1 currently languishing in ninth in the @entity44 , many consider this to be their last shot at qualifying for @entity49 's flagship club competition next season			1
but a number of potential tough draws await on monday due to their unseeded status , including a reunion with former manager @entity53 at @entity54			2
nine teams have already secured a seeding for monday 's draw by virtue of winning their @entity8 group or being one of the four third - placed teams in the @entity2 with the best record			1
they include @entity64 's @entity32 , @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity33			0
@entity54 will also be seeded if they can clinch top spot in @entity67 with a home win against @entity69 on thursday night			0
@entity54 head coach @entity53 speaks at a pre-match press conference in @entity71 on wednesday @entity32 head coach @entity64 looks in good spirits ahead of the match against @entity74 although city rivals @entity31 will also be seeded after winning @entity76 , there will be no @entity1 derby in the last - 32 as teams from the same country can not play each other at this stage			1
it could , however , happen if both teams progress to the last 16 , at which stage country protection is removed and the draw is free			0
there will be no ' @entity88 ' between @entity1 and @entity37 as the @entity90 club could only finish second in @entity91 and so will be unseeded			2
@entity93 clubs @entity92 and @entity94 are potential opponents for @entity1 if they can go top of their respective groups on thursday			0
@entity31 take on @entity1 earlier this season - but there will be no derby clash in the @entity8 last 32 @entity100 ( left ) tackles @entity101 during the @entity8 quarter - final between @entity1 and @entity37 in 2003			2
both teams are unseeded for monday 's @entity8 last - 32 draw a match against @entity107 's @entity106 is also a possibility if the @entity110 club seal first place in @entity112 with a draw at home against @entity115			1
if @entity1 go all the way and win the trophy in @entity119 on may 27 , they would enter next season 's @entity2 at the earliest in the play - offs			0
there is a possibility , though , that the @entity8 winners will go straight into the group stages if this season 's @entity2 victors qualify automatically for group entry through their own domestic league			0
the @entity8 last - 32 first legs will be held on february 19 with the unseeded team at home first , before travelling away for the second leg seven days later .			2
