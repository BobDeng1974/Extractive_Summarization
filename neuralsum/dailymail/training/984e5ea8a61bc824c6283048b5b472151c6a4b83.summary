the majority of @entity3 presidents are forgotten in as little as 50 years , researchers have found			0
researchers say that by the year 2060 , @entity3 will remember @entity5 and @entity6 ' as they now remember about our 13th president , @entity7 '			0
however , they found some presidents - including @entity10 and @entity11 , could be remembered longer			1
can you name the presidents in the order they served ? researchers asked college students ( top ) and adults ( bottom ) - and found only the first and last few were known - and @entity20			1
in each test , participants were provided a numbered list with blank spaces and asked to fill in the names of all presidents they could remember in the order in which they served			1
if they could remember names but not the order , they were instructed to guess or to put the names off to the side			0
thus , the results could be scored for recall of presidents with or without regard to correct order			1
' by the year 2060 , @entity3 will probably remember as much about the 39th and 40th presidents , @entity6 and @entity5 , as they now remember about our 13th president , @entity7 , ' said @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41 , who co-authored the new paper			0
he has been testing the ability of undergraduate college students to remember the names of presidents since 1973 , when he first administered the test to undergraduates while a psychology graduate student at @entity49			1
the current study , co-authored with @entity40 graduate student @entity51 , compared results from the presidential - recall tests @entity39 has given to three generations of undergraduate college students ( 1974 , 1991 and 2009 ) and a similar test offered online to 577 adults ages 18 - 69 in 2014			1
while @entity39 's early research used the presidential - recall test to study patterns of remembering and forgetting in individual test takers , the new study was able to uncover how @entity3 forget presidents from our historical or popular memory over time			1
in each test , participants were provided a numbered list with blank spaces and asked to fill in the names of all presidents they could remember in the order in which they served			1
if they could remember names but not the order , they were instructed to guess or to put the names off to the side			0
thus , the results could be scored for recall of presidents with or without regard to correct order			1
the findings showed several consistent patterns in how we have forgotten past presidents and offer a formula to predict the rate at which current presidents are likely to be forgotten by future generations			0
from @entity88 to @entity11 : students were tested on their ability to recall presidents and the order in which they served researchers say that by the year 2060 , @entity3 will remember @entity5 and @entity6 ' as they now remember about our 13th president , @entity7 '			1
among the six presidents who were serving or had served most recently when the test was first given in 1973 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are now fading fast from historical memory , whereas @entity10 has been better retained			1
the study estimates that @entity96 will be forgotten by three - fourths of college students by 2040 , 87 years after his leaving office , bringing him down to the level of presidents such as @entity109 and @entity110			2
how quickly presidents are forgotten : researchers created an algorithm to find out how soon they will be forgotten			0
the current data do not permit assessment of forgetting rates of the most recent presidents , and do not specify why some relatively recent presidents are forgotten more rapidly than others , @entity39 said			0
' @entity10 was president less than three years , but is today remembered much better than @entity97 , ' @entity39 said			2
' one idea is that his assassination made him memorable , but of course that does not apply to @entity123 or @entity110 , who were also assassinated and are remembered relatively poorly			0
in chronological order , the presidents of the @entity3 are : @entity88 , 1789 - 1797 @entity126 , 1797 - 1801 @entity127 , 1801 - 1809 @entity128 , 1809 - 1817 @entity129 , 1817 - 1825 @entity130 , 1825 - 1829 @entity131 , 1829 - 1837 @entity133 @entity132 , 1837 - 1841 @entity134 , 1841 @entity135 , 1841 - 1845 @entity136 , 1845 - 1849 @entity109 , 1849 - 1850 @entity7 , 1850 - 1853 @entity137 , 1853 - 1857 @entity138 , 1857 - 1861 @entity20 , 1861 - 1865 @entity139 , 1865 - 1869 @entity140 , 1869 - 1877 @entity141 , 1877 - 1881 @entity123 , 1881 @entity142 , 1881 - 1885 @entity143 , 1885 - 1889 @entity144 , 1889 - 1893 @entity143 , 1893 - 1897 @entity110 , 1897 - 1901 @entity145 , 1901 - 1909 @entity146 , 1909 - 1913 @entity147 , 1913 - 1921 @entity148 , 1921 - 1923 @entity149 , 1923 - 1929 @entity150 , 1929 - 1933 @entity151 , 1933 - 1945 @entity96 , 1945 - 1953 @entity152 , 1953 - 1961 @entity10 , 1961 - 1963 @entity97 , 1963 - 1969 @entity153 , 1969 - 1974 @entity98 , 1974 - 1977 @entity6 , 1977 - 1981 @entity5 , 1981 - 1989 @entity154 , 1989 - 1993 @entity155 , 1993 - 2001 @entity156 , 2001 - 2009 @entity157 , 2009 - ' @entity10 may be well recalled because his brothers and other family members were ( and are ) active in politics and help to keep his memory alive , ' @entity39 speculated			1
@entity162 , if elected in 2016 , has the potential to be much better remembered than her husband , because her presidency would represent a unique first in @entity3 history			0
@entity11 may be well remembered for the same reason , @entity39 said			2
the rate at which college students forgot the order of recent presidents remained remarkably consistent over time and across different groups of college students			2
in 1974 , nearly all college students recalled @entity97 and his ordinal position ( 36 ) , but by 1991 , the proportion remembering him dropped to 53 percent and by 2009 , it plummeted to 20 percent			0
when asked to name the presidents in the order they served , we as a nation do fairly well at naming the last few presidents , but our recall abilities then fall off quickly , with less than 20 percent able to remember more than the last eight or nine presidents in order , the study finds			1
while @entity3 who were tested could name the nation 's first president ( @entity88 ) and do reasonably well at naming the next three or four presidents in order , the recall success rate for early presidents also drops off sharply , with fewer than 25 percent of @entity3 able to recall more than the first five presidents in order			1
' out of the 150 college students we tested in 2009 , only four of them were able to recall virtually every president and place each in the correct position , ' @entity51 said			2
' it 's possible that these individuals used a mnemonic like a song or rhyme that they learned for the purpose of remembering the presidents			0
' with a few interesting exceptions , the vast majority of presidents in the middle of pack -- from no. 8 , @entity132 , to no. 30 , @entity149 -- already are largely forgotten by the average @entity3 , the study finds			0
a president to be remembered ? @entity162 , if elected in 2016 , has the potential to be much better remembered than her husband , the researchers said , because her presidency would represent a unique first in @entity3 history			0
the probability that anyone who took the test could recall both the name and the order of most presidents in this middle range is quite low , and this level of poor recall for the middle presidents has generally held true in testing across all generations for nearly four decades			2
a notable exception in this middle wasteland of presidential recall is @entity20 and his two immediate successors , @entity139 and @entity140			0
' clearly , @entity20 and his successors are well remembered because of their association with the @entity239 and the ending of slavery , but it is notable that many students and adults also often know that @entity20 was the 16th president , ' @entity39 said			2
other @entity247 presidents who were remembered reasonably well in the free recall portion of the test are @entity145 ( 26 ) , @entity146 ( 27 ) and @entity147 ( 28 ) , a showing that could be related to their favorable rankings by historians and ongoing mentions in popular culture and news media , the researchers suggest .			2
