unnecessary : @entity0 shows a strand of cotton similar to the one which she dropped on the floor , landing her with a £ 75 fine when a strand of cotton fell from one of her gloves as she was out shopping , @entity0 did n’t even notice			1
so the 71 - year - old grandmother was astonished when a council warden pointed out the thread on the pavement – and handed her a £ 75 spot fine for dropping litter			1
‘ i could n’t believe my eyes , ’ she said yesterday			2
‘ i ’m just an ordinary grandmother out shopping , not a litter lout throwing rubbish around			2
’ mrs @entity0 said that when the environmental enforcement officer first stopped her , she had protested her innocence			1
but then he took her to the scene of the crime , showed her the curled - up strand of cotton , and issued the fine			1
yesterday , council officials continued to insist that an offence had been committed , but said they would no longer be demanding that mrs @entity0 paid the penalty , which would have had to come out of her £ 105 weekly pension			1
the pensioner said : ‘ i would n’t have paid it anyway – i would rather have gone to court			0
’ mrs @entity0 , the wife of a retired factory worker , was shopping in her home town of @entity39 , near @entity40 , @entity41 , when she was stopped			1
‘ i had caught my watch on my glove and a piece of cotton had come off and fallen to the ground , ’ she said			0
fine : mrs @entity0 was handed the penalty by an over-zealous official ‘ i did n’t notice			1
if i had i would have picked it up			0
i told the man it was a complete accident but he said it was still litter and to take the matter up in court			0
‘ it was a strand of cotton , not a cigarette butt			0
i ca n’t believe they would fine a pensioner for dropping something like that			2
‘ i asked the enforcement officer , who was burly and rude , “ are you really going to take £ 75 off an old age pensioner ? ” ‘ i am a pensioner , i ’ve worked all my life and i ’ve never claimed anything			0
i live on my £ 105 pension – £ 75 is a big chunk of that for dropping a tiny piece of cotton			0
’ the incident happened on a busy street in @entity39 , @entity41 ( file photo ) her husband @entity75 , 72 , said : ‘ my wife was very shaken by the whole thing			0
’ @entity78 yesterday confirmed that a fixed penalty fine had been issued for the piece of cotton but said it had withdrawn it after an investigation			2
a spokesman said : ‘ while we are satisfied an offence was committed , it is not in line with our priority of tackling litter more associated with affecting street cleanliness			0
’ in 2009 , @entity93 - @entity92 , 30 , was given a £ 75 fine after a tissue she was using to wipe her nose blew away in strong winds as she ran to catch a bus in @entity98 , @entity99			1
last year , @entity100 was threatened with a fine of up to £ 75,000 after putting up 1,000 posters around her home in @entity104 , @entity105 , when her @entity107 terriers , @entity108 , five , and @entity109 , three , disappeared .			2
