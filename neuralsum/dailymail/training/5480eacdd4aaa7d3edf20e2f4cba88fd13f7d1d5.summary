by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 24 april 2013 at the height of the @entity4 , the decade ’s biggest names – @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 tycoon @entity9 – enjoyed an enviable existence , partying the nights away in @entity13 , sunbathing in @entity15 resorts and cruising the @entity16 on luxury yachts , while hordes of paparazzi pursued them , intent on immortalising their every moment			1
little did the packs of photographers know that their illustrious prey often escaped to a secret hideaway : a single - storey house on @entity28 in @entity29			1
it was owned by the late writer @entity31 , their friend and confidant who chronicled them all in @entity36 , the book he and legendary photographer @entity38 published			1
humble facade : the home of late writer @entity31 where he entertained the stars of the @entity4 has been put on the market by his widow @entity45 for £ 1million today @entity31 ’s widow @entity45 has decided to downsize and sell the four - bedroom house that was once a mecca for the glitterati			1
she has put it on the market for £ 1 million and will be moving to @entity51 in @entity52 to be nearer her daughter			1
originally , her husband worked as a showbusiness correspondent in @entity56 but returned to @entity57 in 1965			2
his @entity59 beach house had been the ultimate @entity61 party palace despite appearing small and garage - like from the outside , and @entity31 decided to recreate this in @entity29			1
@entity45 recalls : ‘ we were in love with the idea of walking through a discreet front door into a beautiful , spacious , glamorous house – something unexpected , and almost magical			2
so we worked with architect @entity70 and had the house built for £ 30,000			1
then we began giving parties and intimate dinners for our celebrity friends			2
so many came here that @entity8 once announced , ‘ ‘ a blue plaque should be put up outside the house saying : this is where swinging @entity29 really started			1
” ’ where they sat : the living room which has been graced by celebrities such as @entity5 and @entity6 and @entity8 wine and dine : the house was built especially for @entity31 and @entity85 for £ 30,000 in the @entity4 space to socialise : the kitchen in the four - bedroom home in @entity28 , south @entity29 sellers – whose authorised biography @entity91 was written by @entity31 – was virulently opposed to him moving to @entity29			1
‘ he tried really hard to talk us out of it and kept saying we should only live in @entity94 , ’ @entity45 explains			2
‘ then he came to see the house , fell in love with it and used to call it “ my safe house ”			2
‘ he was paranoid and insisted on a secret phone line being installed			1
a ‘ ‘ phone expert ’ ’ came to set it up , but it ended up knocking out all the phones in the neighbourhood			0
’ in those days there were only six houses in the area			0
today , given its proximity to @entity111 and the fact that the journey from @entity114 to @entity115 is only 12 minutes , the neighbourhood has expanded considerably			0
the 4,000 sq ft cedar - wood house , set in a third of an acre , is surrounded by a white ranch - board fence , behind which is a brick patio			1
three stone steps lead to double oak doors that open on to the entrance hall			0
guest : @entity5 another door at the house – a 13th @entity129 monastery door , which @entity45 and @entity31 used as a headboard – caught the eye of one of their most illustrious visitors , @entity132			1
‘ she came to our house with @entity9 soon after their wedding			0
she told me she loved my old @entity129 door			0
i should have given it to her , ’ @entity45 says , ‘ because it was later stolen			0
’ from the entrance hall , double doors lead to the vast living room – the site of the celebrity parties – which has maple floors , @entity150 windows and a stone fireplace			0
to the right of the living room is the library , complete with a @entity155 carpet from @entity9 ’s yacht @entity157			0
onassis , late one evening , turned up with it over his shoulder			2
the grand piano is a focal point of the living room			0
@entity45 remembers : ‘ @entity163 often played it			0
one night , @entity165 got very drunk and spilled red wine on the carpet , but instantly got salt , threw it on the wine and declared , “ hoover it up in the morning , and the stain will be gone			0
’ at the height of their romance , @entity174 and @entity7 played backgammon on the living - room floor			2
@entity6 took refuge in the house after many of his fights with @entity5 and was once found in the @entity185 ’ sauna , sleeping off a hangover			1
@entity6 adored the garden and once said : ‘ staying here is like waking up in a @entity190 penthouse and then being able to step straight into an @entity57 garden			1
’ another @entity61 icon to enjoy the garden was @entity193 , on whose autobiography @entity31 collaborated			1
before his death last year , @entity31 remembered : ‘ she said it reminded her of @entity197			1
but she was becoming increasingly frail , and i was worried about her			0
‘ she smiled her mysterious smile and said , “ if anything bad happens to me , i ’ll let you know			0
i ’m a witch and i ’ll send you a message			0
” ‘ in 1990 there was a violent storm and an oak in the garden , which @entity193 had always loved , crashed through the window into my study at the very moment she died			0
i believe @entity193 sent me that message , just as she ’d promised			0
’ the property is for sale with @entity215 , 020 8299 0922 , and themodernhouse.net , 020 7704 3504 .			2
