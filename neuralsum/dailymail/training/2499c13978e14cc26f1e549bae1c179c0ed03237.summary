presidential aides have been urging @entity3 's first ever unmarried ' first couple ' to wed quickly to avoid protocol problems on state visits to strict religious countries			1
their status may be viewed as ' living in sin ' by hardline states like @entity15 or the @entity16 , advisors have warned			1
to wed ? sources say @entity3 's new president @entity2 ( left ) is to make his companion @entity4 ( right ) an honest woman and pop the question and the pair have now decided to bow to pressure and tie the knot , @entity3 's @entity22 reported			1
it said today : ' members of @entity4 's family have confided in us to reveal that they are planning a happy event , and in the not too distant future			1
' for her to become mrs @entity2 would clarify her status in the eyes of the @entity3 people and the world , though the president 's wife technically has no official status in our constitution			1
' @entity2 , 57 , and @entity4 47 , met 15 years ago at a political rally and have been a couple for five years			1
the socialist president has four children with his previous ' live - in lover ' @entity46 , who he left after she lost her bid for the presidency to @entity49 in the last election five years ago			1
ms @entity4 is said to be still so jealous of ms @entity46 that she can not even bear to hear her name spoken			2
complicated : the socialist president @entity2 ( left ) has four children with his previous ' live - in lover ' @entity46 ( right ) until now both mr @entity2 and ms @entity4 have resisted calls to marry			1

' i am not presenting myself to the @entity3 people during this campaign as part of a couple , but as a political personality offering his ideas			2
' we may marry through choice , but not for questions of protocol			2
' and ms @entity4 , a magazine journalist , has also told the @entity3 media they couple ' have no current plans to marry '			2
takeover : @entity75 , wife of @entity3 president @entity49 , is the former first lady she said on her first day as the new first lady today on may 6 : ' i 'm not so sure it will pose a diplomatic problem - though perhaps on a visit to the @entity81			0
' frankly , it 's not a subject that preoccupies me			0
this marriage issue is first and foremost a private matter for us			0
' but she is said to have changed her mind after being repeatedly asked about her status by @entity91 journalist at the recent @entity92 in @entity93 she told @entity3 newspapers on her return : ' they kept asking if i was actually allowed to be there			0
what kind of era are we living in			0

' if they do n't marry then the same thing could happen to him as to mr @entity49 , where whatever his private feelings , he gets married out of his obligation to better perform his duties to @entity3			0
' @entity134 newspaper added : ' there are those close to mr @entity2 who are starting to advise him to do precisely this and do it within a few weeks , just to avoid any possible controversy on his trips overseas			1
