tragic accident : @entity8 , 24 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , is on life support after falling 50ft from a hotel window while sleepwalking			1
above , ms @entity8 is pictured in a @entity7 hospital with a male companion she suffered fractures to her spine , pelvis , ribs and shoulders , as well as a punctured lung and bleeding on the brain			1
despite the seriousness of her injuries , she is not paralysed , has movement in her limbs and is conscious			0
however she is likely to need at least four operations			0
miss @entity39 , a shop display designer , did not have travel insurance but did have a @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , which entitles her to free or reduced - cost treatment			0
but precisely when patients are required to start paying remains a grey area , and her family have been told they may have to contribute up to 30 per cent of her £ 16,000 care costs			1
they have started fund - raising as a result , and will at least have to pay for the air ambulance to take her home to @entity20 , as this is not covered by the @entity43			2
merchandising designer : ms @entity8 was on a family holiday in @entity13 when she plunged from the fifth floor			1
she suffered a broken back , fractured pelvis , broken ribs , and punctured lung , as well as bleeding on the brain resort : ms @entity8 , who is a merchandising display designer at a fashion store , had been in @entity13 as part of a 14 - strong party of women celebrating her mother @entity67 and cousin @entity69 's 40th birthdays ( file picture ) miss @entity8 was with 13 female family members staying at the four star @entity72 to celebrate the 40th birthdays of her mother and aunt			1
toxicology tests proved she was not under the influence of drugs or drink when she fell from the fifth floor at 2am on sunday			1
her cousin @entity69 , 40 , said yesterday : ‘ we are devastated but we know she is lucky to be alive			0
we ca n’t believe she has survived			2
we think the fact she was asleep has saved her life			2
she fell gracefully and was n’t trying to stop herself from falling			2
’ she is being looked after in @entity88 , where she is on a ventilator because of her punctured lung			0
she could be in hospital for several months			2
@entity92 : she is on a life support machine in a @entity7 hospital following the accident at around 2am on sunday ms @entity69 said : ' people will say " why was n't she insured ? it was her own fault			1
" the fact of the matter is she was n't insured , she was n't drinking , it was just an awful accident			0
' any parent would be devastated if it happened to their child			0
we have got to raise some money to get @entity8 home and to get the operations she needs			1
' her mum is in @entity13 with her			0
we think she can actually get some money back with the @entity111 health card but there will be a massive shortfall			2
fundraising effort : ms @entity8 has no holiday insurance and her family are trying to raise 20,000 euros to fly her back to her home in @entity20 ' apparantly @entity7 citizens do n't get the rights we get on the @entity121 , they get about 70 or 80 per cent of the costs but there will still be a huge shortfall			1
we have no idea what the final bill will be			0
' we are not thinking about that , we just want her to get better and back home but its going to be a long period of recovery			1
because she has punctured her lung she is still on a ventilator			0
' as soon as she is fit to have the operations they will assess it from there			0
doctors have said it could be four weeks but it could be four months , we just do n't know			2
' a friend has started a giving page on @entity145			0
we are absolutely overwhelmed by friends and people who do n't even know her giving money , it 's already up to £ 3,500			0
' they are obviously aware that @entity8 should have had insurance but they just want to help , we are hoping that money will go towards the shortfall			1
' we were insured but for whatever reason @entity8 was n't but she might have thought she did n't need it because it was a short break but we all know you do			1
' she added : ' we were n't on a holiday where we were going on jet skis or hiring motorbikes where you hear most of the fatalities are abroad			0
it was a family get together and it ended up like this			2
' ms @entity168 , whose boyfriend @entity169 is flying out to be at her bedside , is believed to need at least four operations , at a cost of 10,000 euros each			0
she is being treated as @entity7 citizen in the @entity174 in @entity13			1
because of this , she will have to find up to 30 per cent of the price - and she then faces the cost of an air ambulance back to the @entity3			0
@entity179 and friends are also raising money for living costs so that her mother can stay with her			0
a @entity3 @entity185 official in @entity13 said last night that she should not have to pay for her care , adding : ‘ if there are problems , she should contact us			0
