in - car satellite navigation is inching ahead of the printed road atlas and is already first choice of younger drivers , according to a report from the @entity12			1
its poll of nearly 24,000 drivers found nearly two thirds ( 63 per cent ) of motorists had used a printed map in the past six months , compared to 60 per cent who used sat nav			1
trusted tool : the faithful printed road map wins out , being used by 63 per cent of drivers just over a third ( 35 per cent ) of drivers say they use both sat nav , and an atlas as back - up to plan a route - with just one in six ( 17 per cent ) relying solely on sat nav			1
regionally the proportion relying solely on sat nav ranges from one in five ( 20 per cent ) in @entity31 to just one in seven ( 14 per cent ) in the @entity32			1
younger drivers aged 18 to 24 are the group most likely to ignore maps altogether , with nearly half ( 43 per cent ) depending on their sat navs alone to navigate the nation 's roads			1
by contrast , fewer than one in ten ( 9 per cent ) of over 65 year olds have ditched printed maps altogether , preferring a hard copy of the nation 's highways to a digital direction - finder			1
among those using both , the highest level is in @entity49 ( 40 per cent ) compared to @entity50 at just 27 per cent			2
about one in five ( 19 per cent ) have used a print - out of the @entity12 's own @entity54 planner			1
overall just over one in ten ( 11 per cent ) plan their routes with a map combined with written instructions			2
however , just one in 20 ( 5 per cent ) of 18 to 24 year olds do this compared to one in seven ( 15per cent ) of over 65s			2
on the rise : 60 per cent of road users said they had used a sat nav recently , and many young people say it is the only way they find out where to go when planning a route around one in 14 ( 7 per cent ) use on - line maps , the same proportion use only a printed map , and one in every 100 say they never travel far enough to need a map or sat nav			1
the poll coincides with the launch of a new book called ' mapping the @entity74 ' by maps expert and author @entity76 ( @entity77 , Â£ 25 )			0
mr @entity76 said : ' the younger generation may be changing the way maps are used but even those using sat navs are still dependent on the mapping behind the devices , so maps and mapping the roads are still vital for the future of road travel			1
' he noted : ' technology has brought us in - car navigation systems to make getting around without a human navigator far easier			2
however , there are numerous tales of those who rely solely on this technology finding themselves in either completely the wrong location or on inappropriate roads for their vehicles			0
' with a good map , you can quite literally see the bigger picture , get a sense of the context of the landscape through which you 're travelling and hunt down some unexpected gems along the way			0
' he added : ' the story of @entity5 's road development is also the story of its political , economic and social history , and the car , more than any other single factor , has shaped our landscape and changed our maps			0
' many people have a love - hate relationship with our busy , bustling , often congested , roads			0
' roads might be seen as a necessary evil to get us through the ' rush hour ' to work but they also give us the freedom to live in different places , to visit friends and relatives , to travel and explore the many wonders that our country has to offer			0
advances : many cars , such as this @entity134 , now have built - in navigation systems ' without roads and maps our lives would be very different			0
' @entity12 president @entity139 said : ' most motorists are still turning to maps when planning car journeys even in the age of high tech navigation systems			1
' he noted : ' as a nation , the @entity5 are obsessed with directions and maps ; just ask a group of people for directions and you will likely receive a variety of routes based on personal preferences and shortcut knowledge			0
' he said : ' as the country 's road network has developed , so has the technology behind the mapping			0
' we depend on our road network for 86 per cent of passenger journeys and more than 90 per cent of freight including almost everything we buy in the shops or online			0
' so knowing the best route is crucial to making these journeys as easy as possible			0

@entity12 *survey* of 24,000 drivers shows that older *methods* still hold sway
but 60 per cent of drivers also said they recently used a sat nav
younger drivers were much more likely to use the high - tech tools
