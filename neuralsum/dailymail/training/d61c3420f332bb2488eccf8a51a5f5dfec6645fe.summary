a proud young dad came on the telephone from @entity2 on tuesday night to tell us how the arrival of his first - born has given him the added motivation to up his game next month and go on to dethrone the two greatest pound - for - pound boxers in the world			0
@entity9 is deep into his training camp near @entity11			2
the pain of spending months apart from his wife and baby daughter will only be worth it if he beats @entity18 in @entity19 on december 13 and then shocks @entity20 or @entity22 – or maybe even both – next year			1
@entity9 speaks in @entity23 ahead of his fight with @entity18 the two fighters appeared in a relaxed mood as they shared the stage with @entity28 ( c ) @entity9 needs to defeat @entity18 to set up a mega bout with either @entity20 or @entity22 @entity9 insists that the birth of his daughter has inspired him to realise his full potential in his ' prime years ' @entity9 and @entity18 face each other on stage at @entity36 ahead of their december 13 fight ‘ i ’m a father now , ’ says @entity9			1
‘ i ’m not only boxing for myself and my countries any longer			0
i ’m fighting for my family			0
‘ it ’s hard being away from home for so long			0
very hard when you have a new baby			0
’ he will turn 28 five days before entering the ring against @entity18 and says : ‘ these are my prime years			2
i have to train even harder , dedicate myself even more , focus all the more intently			0
our daughter gives me the drive for this commitment			2
’ @entity9 ’s wife @entity50 gave birth to little @entity52 this may , a year after they married in @entity54			1
@entity9 has been inspired by the birth of his baby daughter @entity52 in may the 27 - year - old admits that it is difficult spending time away from his wife @entity50 while he is training @entity9 has posted pictures of his tough work out sessions away from home with trainer @entity66 ( @entity67 ) in truth not much else of major significance has happened in the life of @entity72 ’s former two - time world champion since the wedding			1
in the ring there has been just one fight , the solid and useful but hardly earth - shattering out - pointing of @entity77			2
the professional inactivity derived from the false promise of a mega-bout with @entity20			0
while he was waiting for that to happen , in vain , @entity9 passed up a world title challenge to @entity18 last december			1
the @entity2 then surrendered that @entity85 belt to @entity86 , who promptly lost it to @entity9 ’s @entity90 rival @entity88			2
yet as @entity9 and @entity18 finally get it on , the rewards for the victor could be bigger than any championship			1
@entity9 was denied a big money fight with @entity96 , who took on @entity97 ( r ) instead @entity98 boxer @entity22 ( r ) , pictured against @entity99 , is the other name on @entity9 's hitlist @entity9 outpointed @entity77 ( @entity67 ) in @entity19 earlier this year after missing out on a proposed mega-bout @entity90 boxer @entity88 ( r ) is a potential next opponent after beating @entity86 for the @entity85 belt @entity9 is reluctant to look beyond this immediate foe – ' i ’ve learned the hard way not to make that mistake again ’ - but everyone knows that the @entity109 and the @entity22 are on both their horizons			1
promoter @entity112 says : ‘ absolutely , i expect the winner of this one to get the big prize next year			0
’ the unspoken reality is that @entity9 is the only one of the pair who has the profile and stature to land that massive pay - night against @entity20 or @entity22			1
he also brings with him @entity90 pay - view - revenue			0
@entity9 , attending the @entity122 vs @entity124 fight at @entity125 , can offer a @entity90 pay - per - view audience @entity9 survived a fourth round knockdown to defeat @entity128 at @entity129 in april 2013 so it is to build on his box office appeal in @entity2 that he is pursuing glory over there rather than settling for loads more instant money by obliging @entity88 in a @entity136 potentially as enriching as that between @entity122 and @entity124			1
‘ to be honest , ’ he says , ‘ @entity88 would be an easier fight			2
it was @entity86 ’s style which helped him win that title			0
but beating @entity18 would do more to put me back in the mix with @entity20 and @entity22 and i always want to fight the best			1
who knows ? maybe i can have @entity20 and @entity22 in 2015			1
’ maybe , with a modicum of help from little @entity148			0
@entity9 was beaten by @entity149 by a split decision in @entity151 , december 2011 the @entity72 born boxer then followed that with an unexpected defeat by @entity154 in @entity155 ‘ i ca n’t say i ’ve been changing the nappies , ’ he admits			1
‘ my wife and our parents have been taking care of that			0
but after a tough day in the gym it ’s always good to get home and spend time with your child			0
missing that is making me work a lot harder			0
often ten times harder so i have to be careful not to overdo it			0
’ despite the reversal of those back - to - back defeats by a drugged @entity149 and the big punching @entity154 two years ago , @entity112 remains so convinced of @entity9 ’s potential for true greatness that he has elevated him to the top of star - studded bill at the @entity177			1
‘ this is an honour for me , ’ says @entity9			2
‘ my first time headlining in one of boxing ’s biggest arenas			0
’ @entity9 insists it is an honour for him to be headlining at ' one of boxing 's greatest arenas ' also , it is only his second fight at full welterweight and he believes he is ‘ more ready ’ for @entity18 in this division now than he would have been a year ago			1
@entity18 dismisses his warm - up win over @entity191 as ‘ just a job @entity193 had to do against a fading veteran			2
’ @entity9 says : ‘ that was a fight i needed to settle at 147 lbs. ’ he also gives credit to @entity197 for ‘ taking the kind of fight boxing needs more of , between two young fighters in their prime who both have a lot to lose			1
