@entity1 scientists predict stem cells obtained from urine could allow humans to regrow lost teeth			1
the @entity6 has created tooth - like structures in mice and believes one day bioengineered ' tooth buds ' could be transplanted into humans who have lost their teeth			1
the primitive tooth - like structures are the first solid tissues to be developed using a technique in which discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells			1
the @entity6 has created tooth - like structures in mice			2
the primitive teeth - like organs are the first solid organs or tissue to be developed using a technique where discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells the scientists used a new system of tissue culture to grow cells into tiny structures resembling teeth , which they implanted into mice			1
the stem cells were generated from urine , based on previous studies which have shown discarded cells in human waste can be coaxed into becoming pluripotent stem cells ( @entity37 )			1
these can then themselves generate many different cell types , including neurons and heart muscle cells			0
according to @entity43 , the tooth buds are the first solid organs or tissues made from @entity37			0
the scientists said the method could be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth dr @entity53 , of the @entity6 , created the tooth - like structures by forcing @entity37 to mimic two different cell types : epithelial cells , which give rise to enamel , and mesenchymal cells , which give rise to the other three main components of teeth - dentin , cementum and pulp			1
he first created flat sheets of epithelial cells which the researchers then mixed with mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells			0
the product of their labours was transplanted into mice , and three weeks later , tooth - like structures had grown			2
dr @entity53 said : ' the primitive teeth - like organs are structurally and physically similar to human teeth			0
' they are of roughly the same elasticity , and contain pulp , dentin and enamel - forming cells			0
' but the method has its limitations - it involves mouse cells , has a success rate of around 30 per cent and the structures were about one - third of the hardness of human teeth			0
' the scientists used a new system of tissue culture to grow cells into tiny structures resembling teeth , which they implanted into mice			2
the stem cells were generated from urine , based on previous studies which have shown discarded cells in human waste can be coaxed into becoming pluripotent stem cells ( @entity37 ) the researchers believe that tweaking the mixture of cells and the condition of the culture tissue could solve these problems			1
they said : ' the revised method could , in theory , be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth			2
' cells generated from a patient 's urine would not be rejected by the host recipient , as they would be derived from the host 's own cellular material ' the scientists said			0
they believe @entity37 remain a great source of hope for regenerative medicine .			0

@entity1 scientists have created tiny ' tooth buds ' that have been transplanted into mice and grown into tooth - like structures
they are the first tissues to be developed using a technique where discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells
the @entity6 believes the technique could be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud for humans to regrow their teeth
