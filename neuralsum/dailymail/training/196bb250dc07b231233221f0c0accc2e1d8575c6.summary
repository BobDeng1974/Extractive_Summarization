by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:58 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 5 november 2013 the @entity3 leader has been accused of ' willfully ' averting eye - contact when asked about reopening the probe into election rigging in @entity7 @entity8 was accused of ‘ wilfully averting ’ his gaze from the vote - rigging scandal engulfing his party yesterday – as he refused seven times to reopen the inquiry into the activities of the @entity16 union			1
the @entity3 leader came under fire amid fresh evidence of the extraordinary pressure placed on @entity20 , who sparked claims of @entity16 attempting to fix the selection of a candidate in @entity24			1
but despite growing evidence of a cover - up , mr @entity8 conceded he had dismissed the new claims on the basis of one phone call to mrs @entity20 from a senior @entity3 official			1
the scandal erupted over the summer when mrs @entity20 and three other members of her family alleged they had been signed up as members of the @entity3 in @entity24 without their knowledge			1
that was at a time when @entity16 ’s boss in @entity7 @entity39 , who was also chairman of @entity40 , was trying to secure the seat for @entity42 , a close friend of @entity16 boss @entity43			1
@entity3 launched an inquiry , but dropped it after mrs @entity20 signed an affidavit which they claimed had appeared to change her testimony			1
in an explosive development , @entity16 last night admitted a solicitor hired by the union helped draw up that sworn statement			0
‘ @entity54 solicitors from @entity55 attended on the @entity57 family … and took statements from them clarifying their party membership situation on august 1 , 2013 , ’ said the statement			0
‘ affidavits were then drafted by @entity55 for members of the @entity57 family … on september 2 , @entity55 emailed the @entity3 copies of the affidavits from the @entity57 family			2
’ mr @entity8 is now facing claims that the prospect of a confrontation with @entity43 is ' scaring ' the @entity3 leader since it would lead to a ' civil war ' with his biggest paymaster that could torpedo his leadership			1
ms @entity20 and her family members were reportedly signed up to the @entity3 without their knowledge or permission at a time when @entity42 ( right ) , a friend of @entity16 boss @entity43 was chasing the seat @entity16 's boss in @entity7 @entity39 resigned from his role as chairman of the @entity3 's @entity24 constituency in the wake of the scandal @entity3 insists that affidavit amounts to mrs @entity20 withdrawing her original claims of wrongdoing			1
but the @entity16 statement says : ‘ this was not a matter of the @entity87 “ withdrawing their evidence ”			0
the @entity87 were instead clarifying , or supplementing , the material in the “ @entity24 report ”			2
’ the @entity92 revealed on monday that mrs @entity20 had not changed her evidence			0
in a tape - recorded conversation with a @entity92 reporter , she said : ‘ i did not change the testimony … i did not withdraw anything			0
’ former chancellor @entity98 has called for the investigation to be reopened but mr @entity8 rejected that evidence yesterday – on the basis of one phone call by @entity3 ’s general secretary @entity103 to mrs @entity20 on monday			1
‘ we looked at that evidence , ’ he said			0
‘ the general secretary of the party spoke to the lady concerned and indeed her husband and they both confirmed that the evidence they gave us in september was the evidence they stand by			0
’ but that intervention has left mrs @entity20 distraught			0
yesterday she told the @entity92 the ongoing saga was ‘ destroying ’ her			0
a friend of mrs @entity20 said she was ‘ manipulated ’ and that she had no idea the affadavit was to be used to shelve the investigation into her original complaint			2
both former chancellor @entity98 and @entity3 ’s @entity7 leader @entity121 have called for the investigation to be re-opened			1
repeatedly asked by journalists why he would not reopen the inquiry , mr @entity8 said : ‘ we ’ll look at any new evidence			1
’ however , @entity3 officials have not even asked to hear the @entity92 ’s tape of its interview with mrs @entity20			2
@entity128 , editor of the @entity130 blog @entity131 , last night claimed mr @entity8 was frightened of confronting @entity16			1
he wrote : ‘ the party appears to be wilfully averting its gaze			0
@entity8 was wrong today when he said that no new information had come to light on @entity24			1
’ mr @entity128 said if mr @entity8 orders an investigation , @entity43 will kill off his plans to recast @entity3 ’s relationship with the unions at a special conference in the spring			1
‘ it ’s difficult to imagine a situation where the weakness of the leader was more viscerally demonstrated than to be defeated in such a manner			2
' this is the nightmare scenario which is scaring the leader ’s office and is why they are petrified of re-opening the @entity24 inquiry , ’ said mr @entity128			1
@entity151 : why are you so convinced there has n’t been bullying and intimidation in @entity24 by @entity16 officials ? do n’t you think that you have n’t reopened the inquiry there smacks of weakness and a cover - up ? @entity160 : the candidate around whom there was controversy has withdrawn and is no longer the candidate			1
the party there is in special measures			0
we have ended the union joining scheme under which people were signed up			0
no members recruited under that scheme will be allowed to vote in the selection ... we ’ve had one police inquiry , which was initiated by the @entity3			2
we now have a second police inquiry			0
on top of all that , i ’ve embarked on an absolutely major reform of our party			0
i ’m absolutely determined we do n’t have a repeat of @entity24 anywhere			1
q : @entity98 does n’t think it was enough , though ? m : what @entity98 was saying was that we should look at any new evidence there is			2
yesterday evidence was supposedly produced by one newspaper , the @entity92			0
we looked at that evidence			0
the general secretary of the party spoke to the lady concerned and indeed her husband and they both confirmed that the evidence they gave us in september was the evidence they stand by			0
q : compare and contrast , @entity98 : ‘ you just ca n’t leave matters as they are ’ , and the leader of the @entity3 appearing to say : ‘ there ’s nothing more i can do			1
’ why ? m : i believe there was machine politics in @entity24 which needed to be dealt with			2
that ’s why we ’ve taken such comprehensive action ... i ’m embarked on the biggest reform of the @entity3 that there ’s been for a generation			2
q : @entity98 said there should be a new , thorough , inquiry into @entity24 , not into reform of the @entity3			1
he said @entity3 should do it if the police do n’t move to prosecutions			2
can you silence these questions now by simply saying if the police ca n’t prosecute , ‘ i will open a new inquiry into @entity24 ’ ? m : i think the right thing to do is to look at any new evidence that is presented ... i think the @entity232 should get on with the business of reconnecting with the people of @entity24 , selecting a new candidate and we will get on with the business of reforming our party			1
q : all the things you have just listed that you have done ... shows that something has gone badly wrong and you have not got to the bottom of it and people are going to think that you are not pursuing this			0
m : i think what it shows is that we have taken action on the evidence			0
q : it ’s not just @entity98			2
@entity121 [ @entity255 leader ] too has said the circumstances in @entity24 need looking at ; @entity257 [ @entity3 mp for @entity259 ] as well			1
is n’t there a danger that @entity3 politicians in @entity7 are saying one thing and you ’re saying another ? m : @entity121 was asked about that @entity92 story			1
she rightly said , in my view , we need to look at it – and that ’s what we did			0
q : you said earlier that @entity275 only stands up to the weak , not the strong			0
would we not be forgiven for thinking that you ’ve done exactly the same with @entity43 and @entity276			0
on a scale of 1 to 10 just how frightened of them are you ? m : we took the mail story seriously			0
it ’s right to take seriously any new evidence that ’s presented by people			0
that ’s why we checked it out with the family concerned ... we ’re determined to deal with what happened in @entity24 and determined to change our relationship with union members .			1
