they give a retro glimpse at what holidaying on another planet could be like			1
' @entity4 ' one poster reads , listing the planet as ' a @entity7 '			1
@entity8 - 16b and its twin suns in ideal for sunseekers , and is ' where your shadow always has company '			1
the posters were created by @entity26 's @entity25 , and are marked as coming from the @entity27			1
kepler - 16b is a planet dubbed ' @entity17 ' because of its system 's resemblance to @entity21 's home in @entity22			1
it was spotted by @entity26 's @entity8 in 2012 by catching a dips in starlight as the planet passed in front of its star			1
kepler - 16b could be a rocky planet ( as pictured here ) or a gas giant like @entity43			1
' this discovery is stunning , ' @entity44 of the @entity45 of @entity46 said when it was discovered			1
' once again , what used to be science fiction has turned into reality			1
' binary stars - two suns turning around each other - have been seen before , and astronomers have suspected planets exist around them , but @entity8 's observations are the first to confirm it			1
kepler - 186f was the first @entity61 - size planet astronomers ever found inside the ' @entity62 ' or ' habitable ' zone around another star			1
kepler - 186f was the first @entity61 - size planet astronomers ever found inside the ' @entity62 ' or ' habitable ' zone around another star , where moderate temperatures could allow for the presence of liquid water			1
it circles a red dwarf star 500 light - years from @entity61 in the constellation @entity74			2
a light - year is almost 6 trillion miles			2
the planet is about 10 percent larger than @entity61 and may very well have liquid water — a key ingredient for life — on its surface , scientists said			2
that is because it resides at the outer edge of the habitable temperature zone around its star — the sweet spot where lakes , rivers or oceans can exist without freezing solid or boiling away			2
the planet probably basks in an orange - red glow from its star and is most likely cooler than @entity61 , with an average temperature slightly above freezing , " similar to dawn or dusk on a spring day , " @entity91 said			2
the final destination on offer , hd 40307g , is a planet twice as voluminous as earth with eight times its mass it orbits at about the same distance from its sun , meaning it receives a similar amount of solar energy as @entity61 gets - increasing chances it may be habitable			2
kepler - 186f was the first @entity61 - size planet astronomers ever found inside the ' @entity62 ' or ' habitable ' zone around another star - and according to @entity26 could be perfect for extreme sports enthusiasts			1
the posters were revealed a day after eight new planets have been discovered in the ' @entity62 ' zone of their stars , orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist			1
the discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of @entity61 which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars			2
among these eight , astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to @entity61 of any known exoplanets to date			2
the eight new planets have been discovered in the ' @entity62 ' zone of their stars , orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist			2
' most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky , like @entity61 , ' said lead scientist dr @entity138 , from the @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity141			2
the two most @entity61 - like planets , known as @entity8 - 438b and @entity8 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. with a diameter just 12 per cent bigger than @entity61 , @entity8 - 438b has a 70 per cent chance of being rocky , the scientists have calculated			0
@entity148 is about one - third larger than @entity61 , and the likelihood of it being rocky is around 60 per cent			0
the two most @entity61 - like planets , known as @entity8 - 438b and @entity8 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. an artist 's impression is pictured the @entity154 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet to be in the habitable zone , also known as the ' @entity154 ' , a planet must be not too hot or too cold and receive roughly as much sunlight as @entity61			1
too much heat from its star , and any water would boil away as steam			0
too little , and the water would freeze solid			0
the @entity154 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface			1
to determine the location of a star 's habitable zone , scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits			1
knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry			0
for example , molecules in a planet 's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out			1
how much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes			0
researchers in @entity197 now claim that @entity61 - sized planets could support life at least 10 times further away from stars than first thought			0
' for our calculations we chose to adopt the broadest possible limits that can plausibly lead to suitable conditions for life , ' dr @entity138 added			0
kepler - 438b receives about 40 per cent more light than the @entity61 giving it a 70 per cent probability of having a habitable zone orbit			0
in comparison , baking hot @entity211 has twice as much			0
the other star gets about two - thirds as much light as @entity61 and is 97 per cent likely to be in the habitable zone			0
co-author dr @entity218 , also from the @entity219 , said : ' we do n't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable			0
all we can say is that they 're promising candidates			0
' neither of the planets are our close neighbours			0
kepler - 438b is located 470 light - years from @entity61 while the more distant kepler - 442b is 1,100 light - years away			0
the team , whose findings were presented at the @entity233 's annual meeting in @entity234 , studied planetary candidates first identified by @entity26 's kepler space telescope			1
all the planets were too small to confirm by measuring their masses			0
instead , they were validated using a computer program that determined they were statistically likely to be planets			0
after the analysis , follow - up observations showed that four of the planets were in multiple star systems			0
the research is also published in the @entity249			0
an artist 's impression of an @entity61 - like planet orbiting a star that has formed a planetary nebula			1
earlier in its life , this planet may have resembled the newly discovered @entity8 438b			0
