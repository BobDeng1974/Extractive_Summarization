@entity9 ! ( @entity9 ) lets people use their current phone as if it had a different number , manage as many numbers as they want and remove all traces of call and message history at the press of a button			1
the app can also be password protected to keep others from seeing what 's been said			0
@entity9 ! ( @entity9 ) can be used on multiple devices and there is also no limit to the amount of numbers ( selection pictured right ) a user can rent			1
an average 30 - day package costs £ 2.29 in the @entity31 and $ 2.99 in the @entity32 , and numbers can be bought from @entity34 to @entity35 , across @entity36 and @entity37 among others ( left ) it was developed by @entity41 - based virtual private network ( @entity42 ) provider @entity43 ! the firm said : ‘ @entity46 ! is the mobile privacy app that lets you use your phone as if it had a different phone number - keeping your personal number private			1
‘ whether you ’re giving out your number at a bar , posting it online or need a new number from a foreign country while abroad or for business , @entity46 ! lets you manage as many numbers as you need quickly and with no fuss			2
’ private numbers could also be used to give to companies to avoid being bombarded by sales calls			2
all calls and texts are routed through the app but appear on the phone 's screen as if they had been sent to the original number			2
but call history and message information is stored on the app itself			0
free trial numbers last for seven days , but other numbers typically expire after 30 days			1
an average 30 - day package costs £ 2.29 in the @entity31 and $ 2.99 in the @entity32			1

when a number expires it enters a ‘ quarantine period ’ for two months to make sure it ’s not being used before being assigned to another user			1
all of the numbers are rented in the same way that major phone providers acquire lists of numbers for their customers			0
this means that , in theory , a number may have belonged to a person on a contract or pay - as - you - go phone previously			0
but this is the same problem that phone manufacturers also have			0
however , all of this privacy comes at a cost - and the small fees soon add up			0
