speaking from @entity13 as they try to trace their children independently , the girls ' parents claim they begged police to take their computers to check for any clues which may lead them to their whereabouts , but that officers only did so ' after many requests '			1
parents and siblings of the teenage girls have now hit out at a series of alleged failures by the @entity41			2
@entity42 , the families ' lawyer , who has travelled with them to @entity44 , said that all contact with the @entity7 authorities and the academy had been ' an attempt to block them from finding out more about the circumstances surrounding the girls ' disappearance '			1

she said : ' we begged the police to take computers to check if there is anything on there useful to help find our daughters			1
' the police only took these things after we asked them many times			1

the 33 - year - old travelled from @entity77 to @entity44 on february 14 and then took an internal flight to @entity79 , a city on @entity13 's border with @entity3			1
she is believed to have been helped by @entity81 , who was arrested last week on suspicion of getting the three east @entity12 schoolgirls across the border			1

there they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in			0
he told @entity96 they were ' smiling as they arrived ' and ' smiling as they left '			0
emotional : the families went to the @entity44 coach station where the teenagers boarded their bus to @entity3 questions : the families hope to find clues that may help them find or even contact their daughters anguish : the families of three missing @entity12 schoolgirls have travelled to @entity13 to retrace their steps @entity109 , sister of @entity9 , told @entity96 : ' this is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we 've followed them all the way out here			1
we want them to know that we love them			0
' @entity119 , sister of @entity10 , said : ' i do n't really recognise my sister , the video and the cctv that we saw			2
