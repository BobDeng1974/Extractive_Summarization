by @entity0 for @entity1 trying - and failing - to fit into a size 20 wedding dress was the wake - up call needed for an overweight mother - of - two			1
as 18st @entity6 struggled into the too - tight bridal gown she had to accept she 'd ballooned to a size 22			2
bursting into ashamed tears , she made a vow to herself to lose weight before marrying her partner @entity12			2
so the beauty therapist from @entity14 joined a local @entity16 class where dancing to sexy salsa , samba and reggaeton tunes helped her to lose a staggering 6st - and also helped her to find a fulfilling new career as a dance instructor			1
she cried when she stood on the scales and tried to squeeze herself into a size 20 in a bid to deny her real dress size			2
but @entity6 decided to fight the flab and that evening signed up for a @entity16 class			1
she had lost 2st in time for her wedding three months later and through committed twerking and salsa - ing she lost another 4st after her big day			1
@entity6 used to cry when she stepped on the scales ( left ) but is now delighted with her transformation she has since trained as a @entity16 instructor and has given up her career as a successful beauty therapist to lead five classes a week helping other women twerk away their tummies			1

i just cried standing on the scales			0
' cream cakes were my favourite things and i was sat eating one at work when i realised i could n’t carry on like this anymore and i could n’t get married at 18st			0

' it was like a party			0
nobody cared what you looked like or what you were wearing and i just danced away the weight			0
