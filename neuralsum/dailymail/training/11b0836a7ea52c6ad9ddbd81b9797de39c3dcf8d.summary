by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 7 february 2013 brainchild : the concept of bringing ice to a hot climate was the idea of @entity7 ' @entity6 having ice cubes in your drink as you relax on a hot beach is an enjoyable , but not innovative concept			1
but the idea of bringing ice to a warm climate was in fact the revolutionary idea of @entity6			1
his vision was to carve frozen water out of a @entity20 pond and send it to hotter exotic climates			0
by 1805 ice had taken its place as a summertime luxury with the wealthy residents of @entity26 during that year , it was suggested to @entity6 , reportedly while he was at a party , that there was a market for overseas ice			1
the idea appealed to @entity6 's entrepreneurial skills and he decided to set up a business of harvesting ice in tropic lands			1
his supply of ice was obtained nearby from @entity39 , a reservoir in @entity41			0
his plan of a foreign ice trade proved difficult to put into practice - it failed many times as the ice melted while he shipped it to @entity50 and @entity51 , reports the @entity52			0
but @entity6 was determined to bring his plan to fruition and realised he could minimise the melting by packing the ice tighter as well as insulating it with sawdust instead of straw			1
his perseverance paid off and @entity6 made his first profits by 1810			1
but his good luck took a turn for the worst when he landed in debtor 's prison after being swindled by a business partner			1
his spell in prison did not not put him off and once he was released , he secured a loan from friends and family enabling him to continue with his obsession			0
he later summed up his determination at the front of his thick ledger which over the course of the years became his ' @entity74 , ' according to @entity75			0
innovative : @entity6 's workers divide a pond into a chessboard pattern and cut ice into two - foot square blocks ice truck : the blocks of ice were packed in sawdust - a good insulator - and poor conductor of heat - to prevent it from melting while being moved ' he who gives back at the first repulse and without striking the second blow ' he wrote , ' despairs of success has never been , is not , and never will be a hero in war , love , or business			1
' his business model proved to be simple but effective - at first @entity6 gave away his ice for free , reasoning customers would return and pay for ice once they had experienced the new sensation			1
after people tried their drinks cold , they could ' never be presented with them warm again , ' @entity6 boasted			1
the ice was laboriously cut by hand with saws , until @entity6 hired a new foreman named @entity111			1
vision : @entity6 summed up his determination at the front of his thick ledger which over the course of the years became his ' @entity74 ' the @entity118 company continued to be a success and ship around the world until domestic electric refrigerators became available in the early 1900s @entity111 developed a horse - drawn ice plough and a system cutting ice into blocks about two feet square			1
his plan was to @entity6 's advantage - the mass - produced ice was easier to transport and store , reducing his costs significantly			1
@entity111 also invented above - ground ice houses , with double walls for insulation			0
21st century living : having ice in your drink as you relax on a hot beach is an enjoyable , but innovative concept as the @entity142 states , ' [ @entity140 ] t was said at his death that practically every implement and device used in the ice business had been invented by @entity146			2
' but @entity6 's real success came in 1833 when he set his sights to @entity149 and decided to transport ice 14,000 miles across the ocean			1
the large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to @entity149 by @entity155 in the ship @entity157 , proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay			0
in comparison to the slush residents were used to for only a few weeks a year , @entity6 's crystal clear ice proved an instant hit			1
the @entity166 thanked him for making ' this luxury accessible , by its abundance and cheapness ' and @entity170 became his most profitable destination			0
at one point in @entity6 's incredible career , he had owned ice - houses all over the world - in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity170 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity184			1
according to iceharvesting.com , he died at 80 years old , worth about $ 12 million in today 's rate			0
although he died in 1864 , the @entity186 carried on the name for a number of years			2
by 1900 nearly every family , grocer and barkeeper in the @entity192 had an icebox			0
during the early 1900s domestic electric refrigerators became available , and by the 1940s they were common in @entity192 homes			0
@entity7 ' @entity6 's dream was to bring ice cut from the frozen water of a @entity20 pond to ship it to hotter exotic climates			1
@entity6 had labourers who would painstakingly cut out blocks of ice from the frozen @entity39 in @entity41 , @entity20 , during the winter using pickaxes and saws before transporting it in hay - lined carriages to be stored in ice houses			2
but once his ice was prepared , he faced an even bigger challenge - how to transport the ice , possibly for several months , and then store it in a hot country without it melting			0
@entity6 had packed his ice in hay but later discovered sawdust was the best at preventing ice from melting			2
despite finding a way to stop his ice from melting during the voyage overseas , he could n't find a merchant willing to ship water - even if it was frozen - inside their ship			0
@entity6 was eventually forced to buy his own brig called the @entity227 for $ 4,750 and set sail for the @entity229 in 1806 with 130 tons of ice cut from a pond on the family estate outside @entity26			2
the ice survived the three - week voyage but melted away in @entity50 because there were no icehouses to store it			0
in 1825 , @entity6 teamed up with one of his suppliers , @entity111 , who invented a two - bladed , horse - drawn ice cutter			2
sea merchants refused to store water inside their ships so @entity6 eventually bought his own brig called the favourite , similar to the one pictured above , to ship his ice cargo abroad previously , the ice had been laboriously cut with saws			2
@entity111 's horse - drawn ice plough sped up the process and meant ice could be cut into blocks about two feet square			0
the device scored an ice sheet into a checkerboard grid of blocks that could easily be pried out with iron bars			0
@entity6 then took on his biggest challenge - a 16,000 - mile journey from @entity26 to @entity170 in 1833			2
the large clear blocks unloaded on one of the first shipments to @entity149 by @entity155 in the another ship @entity157 , proved to be a source of amazement with the crowds gathered at the quay			0
the @entity166 thanked him for making ' this luxury accessible , by its abundance and cheapness ' and @entity170 became his most profitable destination			0
at one point in @entity6 's incredible career , he had owned ice - houses all over the world - in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity170 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , and @entity184 .			2

@entity186 saw a gap and started up a business of harvesting ice
he made his first profits by 1810 , only to be swindled by a business partner
gave away his ice for free , then charged once people were *hooked*
@entity6 : after people tried their drinks cold , they could ' never be presented with them warm again '
