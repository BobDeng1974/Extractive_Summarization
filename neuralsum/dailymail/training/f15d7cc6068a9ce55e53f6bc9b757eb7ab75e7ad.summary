when @entity1 was spotted filming a new @entity3 advert in @entity4 this week , it was n't just the fact she was wearing no knickers and no bra that caught everyone 's attention			1
the 39 - year - old supermodel was trotting about with tousled hair , sporting a whisper - thin beige t - shirt , grey suede thigh - high boots and a cream shagpile coat ...			2
as was her young body double			0
tongues have been wagging ever since , the fashion word abuzz with rumours as to who in the name of @entity21 this @entity22 was			0
the @entity1 - a - like has been revealed by @entity25 as @entity29 - born , @entity28 - based beauty @entity26 , who is signed to storm agency , the same as @entity1 herself , @entity31 and @entity32			1
spot the difference : @entity1 was seen with a body double while filming an advert in @entity4 on monday , and the model has now been revealed as @entity29 - born @entity26 a @entity38 size eight , @entity26 is 5ft 8ins - exactly the same height as @entity1 - and has green eyes , dark blonde hair , long legs and similarly well - defined cheekbones as her lookalike			1
@entity45 at @entity25 have unearthed juicy details about @entity26 's acting career , too			1
not only did she appear in @entity49 ' music video finally found you as his hot and heavy love interest , but she has also popped up in tv shows including @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
she has also been in comedies including @entity57 and @entity58			0
in her spare time she hangs out with her mother and her pet poodle @entity62 , reading 19th century @entity64 literature , eating @entity66 food and collecting @entity68 make - up , according to @entity69			0
@entity22 : @entity26 is signed to storm modelling agency , the same one that looks after @entity1 , @entity31 and @entity32 who wore it best ? @entity1 did her best to give the younger model a run for her money on show : @entity26 was more than happy for her coat to fall open to reveal her vest and knickers the excitement surrounding @entity82 kicked off on monday , when @entity1 , who rose to fame in the @entity84 , stepped out by the restaurant @entity86 to start filming she kept her body under wraps beneath a large white fur coat			1
apart from her thigh - high boots and a little bit of vest peeking out , @entity1 did n't appear to be wearing much else			1
in fact she was wearing so little that she seemed to have forgotten her underwear as when she stepped out of the car she gave a little too much away beneath her flesh coloured tights , which she wore to create the illusion of flawless skin			0
but unusually the star , who is married to @entity101 , came over all shy and left the majority of flashing to her body double			0
100 % @entity1 ? @entity1 in the @entity105 campaign shoot ... but where does @entity1 end and @entity26 begin ? not giving it away : @entity1 seemed reluctant to open her coat and show her vest beneath sneak peak : as @entity1 got out of the car while filming her coat fell open to reveal her stomach too much : it seemed @entity1 was wearing just a pair of flesh coloured tights without any knickers on rising to the challenge of being @entity1 â€™s counterpart the fresh - faced model confidently strutted around with the fur coat wide open			1
an onlooker who saw the filming taking place near @entity125 said : ' it 's no surprise @entity1 had a body double on set as her skin appeared a little ropey			2
much to everyone 's surprise the usually confident @entity1 looked a little on the shy side			2
' the appearance of a body double raised questions about just how often @entity1 's body has been replaced in recent campaigns			2
top of her game : it 's surprising that the well - known model would choose to have someone act as her body double			0
