by @entity0 published : 04:44 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 22 august 2012 a catalogue of police failings allowed a sadistic killer to murder his ex-partner and daughter , an investigation has found			2
officers took ' inadequate action ' to arrest @entity9 , 50 , before he shot @entity10 , 38 , and @entity11 , two , at their home in @entity13 , @entity14 , the police watchdog concluded			1
@entity16 , of @entity17 , near @entity18 , was given two whole - life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders , which happened in june last year			2
he is pictured , left , in a police photograph taken prior to him murdering @entity10 and daughter @entity11 , and , right , baring his injured face last year after shooting himself following the savage killings it emerged during his trial at @entity31 that police had visited either his address or @entity36 @entity35 ' home six times in the two years before the murders			1
the trial heard that @entity16 stormed ms @entity10 â€™ house and blasted her and their daughter @entity11 with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him			1
he then shot himself in the face , but survived			0
the court heard that @entity16 ' systematically tortured ' ms @entity35 for several hours before the killings , forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair			1
ms @entity10 ' 10 - year - old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer			1
the couple , who had a long history of domestic abuse , were due to appear at a court custody hearing the next day			0
a damning report released today by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) concludes that @entity63 missed chances to arrest @entity16 before the killings			1
the @entity24 investigation found a lack of adequate training , insufficient resources allocated to domestic violence cases and poor oversight by the force			0
it said inadequate action was taken to arrest @entity16 at the earliest opportunity when reports were made of him breaching a non-molestation order			1
killed : @entity10 and her daughter @entity11 were murdered at their @entity14 home in june 2011 a catalogue of incidents involving the couple reported to police over a two - year period were treated in isolation by officers			1
the force failed to take into consideration the possibility that ms @entity35 had not pursued complaints against @entity16 because she was scared of him , the investigation found			1
ms @entity35 made a higher number of calls to police in the two months before the murders , but the force failed to respond properly , the report stated			1
ms @entity35 ' father @entity101 praised @entity63 for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths			1
he said : ' as a family we would again like to say thank you to all those , including friends and neighbours , who have shown us such support and kindness since the murders of @entity10 and @entity11			1
' we have also received marvellous support from the police murder investigation team led by detective chief inspector @entity117 , from police family liaison officers and the victim support service , and we are grateful to all of them for helping us through such a traumatic time			0
' we have been kept informed by the @entity24 of their investigation and findings and have had opportunity to read through and discuss their report			0
' we realise one evil man is responsible for taking @entity10 and @entity11 away from us and not having them in our lives any more remains extremely difficult to bear			2
' while we understand at times @entity10 could have been more cooperative with the police , we do feel that @entity63 could have done more to prevent the deaths ; they should have taken greater steps to protect @entity10			1
' difficult to bear ' : @entity35 ' father @entity101 , pictured with the victim 's mother @entity136 during the trial , praised @entity63 for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths ' for instance , we are still of the view she should have had a panic alarm installed at her home which may have allowed her to summon assistance at a crucial time after her phones had been smashed			1
' and we think that officers dealing with ongoing incidents should have been more aware of the history and should have better identified the risks			0
' the @entity24 said that , while individual officers could have done things better , it was a failure of police systems rather than of individuals			2
@entity24 commissioner @entity160 said : ' the deaths of @entity10 and @entity162 are shocking to us all			2
' it is impossible to say with any certainty whether if individual officers or the force had done things differently , ms @entity35 and @entity11 would still be alive today			1
' while individual police officers could and should have done things better , this is not essentially a failure of individuals , but a failure of systems			0
' the investigation identified a lack of adequate training , insufficient resources allocated to domestic violence cases and poor oversight			0
murdered : @entity10 and her daughter , @entity11 , two , were shot dead at close range with a shotgun ' this is a tragic and disturbing case and the investigation has identified several key issues which apply to many other cases where domestic homicide is the outcome			1
' many women are reluctant to pursue criminal proceedings against abusive partners , sometimes even to seek help at all			0
' there are many reasons for this , and often it is fear that they will exacerbate the situation and increase the danger they face			0
' undoubtedly this poses significant challenges for the police and other agencies , but it is essential in these situations that all possible is done to protect the victims and their children			0
' @entity211 to seek help or give evidence against the perpetrator is often due to fear and can be a sign of vulnerability , not culpability , and this must be recognised when a risk assessment is completed			0
' responding to the report , which was released today , @entity63 said it accepted the findings and apologised for the failings which had been identified			0
assistant chief constable @entity224 said : ' on behalf of everyone at @entity63 , i extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of @entity10 and @entity162 , who were brutally murdered by @entity9 in the early hours of june 6 , 2011			1
' @entity63 accepts the findings of the @entity24 report , and apologises for the failures identified there			1
' every police officer involved in the case of @entity10 and @entity11 is devastated by their passing			1
i too am devastated by their deaths			0
i became a police officer to protect the vulnerable , and to put criminals like @entity16 behind bars			2
' @entity63 is committed to working tirelessly to reduce the likelihood of tragedies such as this from occurring again			0
' he added : ' the unbelievable inhumanity of these murders led @entity250 to be sentenced to two whole - life prison terms - the most extreme punishment which the @entity255 judicial system can impose			0
' you would think that a man capable of such horror would have a history of violence			0
@entity16 did not : he had no convictions or cautions for violence			0
murder weapon : the shotgun used by @entity9 to kill his partner and their two - year - old daughter ' in fact , the @entity24 has found that significant ' information concerning @entity16 's violence towards @entity10 was not available to the police or social services			1
' the @entity24 also stated that there was no information that @entity16 had access to a firearm			2
' @entity63 acts promptly and decisively whenever it receives credible intelligence about illegally - held weapons			0
' @entity63 accepts the report of the @entity24 and welcomes the recommendation that processes should be developed for better information sharing between police forces and agencies such as social services , courts and solicitors			2
' this is particularly important in cases involving child custody proceedings , where allegations of domestic violence have not been reported to officers			0
' it should be stressed that the @entity24 investigation found that it is impossible to say with any certainty that , if the force had done things differently , @entity10 and @entity11 would be alive today			1
' it also found no evidence of misconduct by any of our officers			0
' earlier this year , @entity63 apologised for its failings in a chillingly similar murder case			2
the force was reprimanded for its handling of the murder of @entity307 - who was killed by her ex-partner in 2008			0
@entity307 , 50 , was strangled to death with a dog lead in her @entity31 home by convicted killer @entity312 just days after she had phoned @entity63 saying she was in danger			2
an @entity24 report into @entity307 's murder concluded that the mother - of - two 's death was ' predictable and preventable ' and that she had been ' badly let down ' by police			2
ms @entity307 had phoned police to say she suspected @entity312 had tried to break into her home , but the incident was not logged as domestic violence and was there not given a high priority			0
@entity63 response to @entity24 report into the murders of @entity10 and @entity162			1

@entity63 took ' inadequate action ' to arrest @entity9 before he shot his ex-partner @entity10 and daughter @entity11
ms @entity10 , 38 , and @entity11 , 2 , were murdered at their home in @entity13 , @entity14 , in june 2011
