sharing a platform : @entity1 and sir @entity2 yesterday @entity1 ignited a huge controversy last night by claiming that all drug users should be treated as ‘ victims ’			1
the @entity6 leader said they should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances – even if they they are caught with ‘ harder ’ drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine			1
meanwhile , sir @entity2 made the astonishing claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause ‘ any harm ’ – despite evidence that a quarter of new cases of psychosis are linked to it			2
announcing his party ’s new drugs policy yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ‘ we should n’t be treating the criminal “ mr @entity23 ” the same as the users			1
the latter are the victims of the former			2
’ but his comments were dismissed by the head of the @entity29 think tank @entity30 , who said : ‘ are all users victims or is there a large proportion of people who enjoy drugs and take them recreationally ? it is a question of demand , rather than people who need to be treated for an addiction			1
’ other experts have also questioned whether it is right to label all drug users as victims			1
@entity45 , senior lecturer in sociology at @entity47 , said : ‘ the problem we have today is that society finds it difficult to hold people to account for their actions			2
‘ the idea of moral responsibility is very weak because we assume that everyone ’s a victim			2
people do n’t need medical support – unless their bodies are falling to bits – they need to take responsibility for their own actions			0
’ the @entity6 ’ new policy would end prosecutions for people caught with small amounts of drugs for ‘ personal use ’			1
it would cover all drugs			2
mr @entity1 said the policy would be included in the @entity6 manifesto			1
it is widely seen as a pitch to win back young voters disillusioned by the party ’s betrayal over university tuition fees			0
the @entity6 leader said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances – even if they they are caught with ‘ harder ’ drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine mr @entity1 ( bottom left ) is facing opposition to his plan from @entity87 ( pictured at @entity89 's questions this afternoon ) , who claims decriminalising drugs would increase their use with neither @entity92 nor the @entity93 backing decriminalisation , it is unlikely to become government policy even if the @entity6 remain in power after the election			1
yesterday 's announcement follows a controversial ‘ research ’ project ordered by @entity101 ministers , which used taxpayers ’ money to study drugs policy around the world			1
@entity107 and @entity108 jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs			2
they travelled to ten countries , including the @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , at a cost of almost £ 40,000			0
the @entity6 seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like @entity114 cut the health damage caused by drugs			1
but critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen			2
mr @entity1 received a public endorsement yesterday from sir @entity2 , who suggested that smoking skunk is safe			1
the @entity130 tycoon shared a platform with the @entity6 leader to promote the party ’s pledge			0
he said : ‘ of people taking hash [ cannabis ] , something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... take people taking skunk			0
‘ it ’s slightly worse than alcohol			0
but there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it ’s not doing them any harm			0
’ a study last month by @entity152 found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk			0
the report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode			0
last night , mr @entity1 also insisted that the so - called ‘ war on drugs ’ was ‘ not working ’ , although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in @entity164 for years			1
@entity167 rejected mr @entity1 ’s analysis and said it was not supported by @entity87			1
sir @entity2 ( pictured at an event in @entity170 with @entity171 , left , and princess @entity172 and @entity173 , right ) made the claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause ‘ any harm ’ @entity177 , chief executive of charity @entity178 , which works with disadvantaged young people , said : ‘ cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with , so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy			0
‘ making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it			0
the result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential			0
’ cannabis could be available on the @entity196 under @entity6 plans			0
under the proposals , doctors would be able to prescribe the drug for medicinal reasons .			0

@entity1 said users should not be given criminal records for possession
he said decriminalisation would apply to ' harder ' drugs such as heroin
*deputy* @entity89 's announcement publicly endorsed by @entity212
experts *condemned* move , saying it will push thousands into addiction
neither @entity92 nor the @entity93 are backing @entity1 's decriminalisation plan
