the first potato genetically modified to resist blight may soon be grown in @entity2			1
it was engineered in a three - year project that saw genes from a wild @entity7 potato inserted into a normal @entity8			1
scientists say it is fully resistant to blight , caused by the organism @entity12 , which destroys up to half of @entity2 crops in a bad year			1
revolution : professor @entity16 , who led the three - year study , with the two crops which were combined the disease was responsible for the @entity21 famine of 1845 and remains potato farmers ’ greatest enemy , costing them £ 60 million a year			1
however , critics say tampering with genes in crops to create ‘ frankenfoods ’ could damage natural ecosystems and affect human health , and insist shoppers would never knowingly buy @entity33 products			1
the results of the latest research , published today in a @entity37 journal , show 100 per cent of @entity39 plants in a trial were infected by blight , while the new variety was fully resistant			2
boiling with anger : will @entity33 spuds soon be in shops ? the researchers , at the @entity47 in @entity48 , hope to use the technology on the @entity52 potato , which makes up 15 per cent of the @entity2 market			1
desirees make up 2 per cent			0
consumer fears have so far kept genetic engineering out of @entity2 farming			0
no @entity33 products have ever been commercially grown in this country , and only one – a pest - resistant maize – is authorised for cultivation in @entity63			0
currently all @entity33 foods have to be labelled , but meat , milk and eggs from farm animals fed on @entity33 products do not , and campaigners are worried about political pressure to accelerate research in the field			0
environment secretary @entity74 has warned that @entity2 risks becoming the ‘ museum of world farming ’ if it does not embrace the technology			0
but @entity78 , head of policy at the @entity80 , said : ‘ there is no market for @entity33 potatoes in the @entity2			2
‘ growing any @entity33 potatoes in the @entity2 could lead to contamination in the supply chain , resulting in massive loss of markets for @entity2 farmers			2
’ @entity90 , director of the @entity92 campaign group , said : ‘ experience shows that the @entity2 does n’t want @entity33 in its shopping basket and @entity2 farmers are far too smart to grow something they ca n’t sell , so just who is this new potato being developed for ? ’ the campaign group @entity98 accused the @entity99 , which funded the trial , of wasting taxpayers ’ money			1
dr @entity103 , director of @entity98 @entity2 , said : ' there are blight - resistant @entity39 potatoes already on the market			2
why waste money , take unnecessary risks , and end up with a product that no one wants to eat ? ' dr @entity103 , director of @entity98 @entity2 , said : ‘ there are blight - resistant @entity39 potatoes already on the market			0
why waste money , take unnecessary risks , and end up with a product that no one wants to eat ? ’ but professor @entity115 , who led the research , said : ‘ this is the first peer - reviewed report of a @entity33 trial conducted in the @entity2 in which there was clear benefit of the trait – in this case disease resistance – illustrating the potential of the technology			2
’ it would stop farmers having to spray crops , and professor @entity16 hopes to ‘ replace chemical control with genetic control ’			0
he said the @entity33 crops would produce three times more potatoes than normal varieties			0
scientists are now studying ways to thwart future attacks by blight that becomes resistant to the new variety			0
before the potato can be planted commercially and sold to consumers in the @entity2 , it will have to pass notoriously laborious @entity143 tests for toxicity , allergic reactions and the risk of contaminating other crops with modified genes .			1

genes from @entity7 potato were inserted into normal @entity8
it was 100 per cent resistant to blight , which caused @entity21 famine of 1845
the disease still *kills* half of all @entity2 crops in a bad year
@entity33 *supported* by *government* but campaigners fear risk to human health
