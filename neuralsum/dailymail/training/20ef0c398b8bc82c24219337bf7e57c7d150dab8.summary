@entity0 embodies the word supermodel - the mere mention of her name conjures up glossy catwalk images of the heyday of modelling in the late eighties and early nineties			1
but the 48 - year - old claims that those golden years are over and says models can no longer become superstars because big brands and magazines are only interested in celebrities			1
in a new interview with @entity16 , out tomorrow , @entity0 discusses the death of the supermodel and places the blame at the door of reality stars , pop singers and @entity24 actresses , who regularly snap up the front covers of publications			1
but she has claimed in a new interview with @entity16 that they are now extinct because magazines and advertisers now prefer reality stars , pop singers and actresses @entity0 said : ' models are not really getting covers now , and they 're not getting the big cosmetics contracts and that 's where the money is - it 's actresses and singers and reality tv people			1
' @entity0 was one of the original supers , alongside women including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
the women dominated fashion in the 80s and early 90s and were feted by design houses like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 as well the glossy magazines like @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
they were also giants in the advertising world , snapping up contracts with global brands like @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0

@entity0 claims that appearing on magazine covers and in advertising campaigns was of little interest to actresses back in the day because they wanted to seen as serious artists			2

" and all of a sudden fashion was n't just about @entity59 and couture , there was an explosion of coverage and we were the rock stars of that			1
' since those early days , the fashion world has managed to produce a couple of supermodels in the forms of @entity94 and @entity93			0
and more recently , @entity114 has emerged head and shoulders above the rest of the new breed of models , bagging contracts with everyone from @entity122 to @entity123			0
