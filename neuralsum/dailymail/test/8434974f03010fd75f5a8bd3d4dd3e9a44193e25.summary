an artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography			1
@entity7 photographer and illustrator , @entity9 , takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built - up areas to create a frame of buildings			1
the space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed ' sky art '			0
on his website @entity9 says that his artistic aim is to ' show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us , what we can construct with a boundless imagination '			2
before and after : @entity9 's original shot ( left ) and after it is transformed into ' sky art ' ( right ) @entity9 , who is also known as @entity31 , is based in @entity7 but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities			1
in the past year alone he has visited @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40 in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations			0
since he began creating sky art in 2011 , @entity9 has made a name for himself among critics , art lovers and journalists all around the world			1
speaking to the @entity50 , @entity9 said : ' the sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways			2
' ' the bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself , the big man in the sky , but it â€™s not meant to be religious in any way '			0
surreal : three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot upside down : a bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings peace out : an illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph cheshire cat : a drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been using a fish - eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot , @entity9 then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using @entity90			1
these abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes			0
one inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky ; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of @entity104 reclining between two buildings			0
self portrait ? a man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard twit twoo : a black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void thumbs up : an image of a man holding a @entity120 of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses a signature @entity9 figure appears to be a bearded man in a @entity128 striped top who features in various guises throughout the ' sky art ' images			2
in one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar , and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a @entity120 of a cloud			0
as well as surrealism , optical illusion is also a key theme in @entity9 's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around			1
@entity147 : an illustration of a masked man holding a @entity151 toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line optical illusion : this sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to @entity9 's illustration one image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind - boggling affect			1
similarly , an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it			0
meanwhile , the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks			0
trompe l'oeil : it 's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration sea - ing double : the distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind - bending photo to look at for more information visit the artist 's website			2

@entity7 artist @entity9 combines photography and illustration to create clever imagery
he takes photographs of the sky in urban *locations* around the world
the buildings in the photographs act as a frame for him to draw on abstract illustrations
