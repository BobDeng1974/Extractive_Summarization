by @entity0 for the @entity1 it 's not quite panic stations , but saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity5 in @entity7 's first competitive game as manager highlighted deficiencies at @entity10			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 have two weeks to act before the transfer window closes			0
they will be seeking to avoid another disastrous season , and here 's who they 're after , and what chance they have of capturing them			0
early worry : saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity5 highlighted huge deficiencies in the @entity25 team down to business : @entity27 has work to do before the transfer window closes on september 2 @entity30 club : @entity32 @entity33 : £ 16m to £ 30m @entity27 's new priority target			1
the left - sided centre back will allow @entity25 to bring the ball out of defence better and improve the balance of their team			1
third party ownership is the obstacle but should be resolved			0
chances : 9/10 priority : @entity30 ( right ) was promising at the @entity45 for @entity46 , and has a good chance of signing @entity49 chasing @entity50 @entity51 club ; @entity53 @entity33 : £ 25m to £ 80m @entity54 only returned to training last month after a serious knee injury and @entity53 's escalating valuation makes the deal a difficult one for @entity25 to complete			2
if fully fit , @entity54 would prove the midfielder @entity25 sorely miss. chances : 7/10 midfield general : the @entity11 knows @entity27 , but has only just returned from a serious injury @entity62 club : @entity64 @entity33 : £ 50m one of the best wingers in the world , who @entity27 publicly hailed as one of the players he would like to have			1
however , the deal is extremely expensive and @entity71 wants the @entity72 to stay			0
chances : 1/10 dreaming ? £ 50m - rated @entity73 is drowned out with the talent at @entity64 , but @entity71 wants him @entity75 club : @entity77 @entity33 : £ 17m blind brings something @entity27 values in a squad , which is versatility			1
he can play left back , left wing back and defensive midfield			0
has doubts in himself whether he could handle the physical side of the @entity87			0
chances : 6/10 here and there : versatile @entity11 @entity75 would be a useful addition at @entity10 @entity90 club : @entity92 @entity33 : £ 15m the @entity94 midfielder is one that has been discussed by @entity25 scouts and would be perfect but for his age having just turned 30			2
played last season with knee injuries and is still recuperating but @entity92 would sell			0
chances : 3/10 happy : @entity45 winner @entity90 is a legend at @entity92 , and the @entity101 side could sell @entity102 club : @entity104 @entity33 : £ 35m @entity25 have an interest in the @entity107 midfielder and know they could complete a deal should they wish to press ahead but there are too many concerns at this stage with the repair of @entity102 's knee injury among them			1
chances : 1/10 saga : speculation surrounding @entity102 's future has been rife during the summer			2

@entity25 lost 2 - 1 to @entity5 in @entity7 's first game in charge
the loss highlighted deficiencies in the side after finishing *seventh* last year
@entity25 are close to signing centre back @entity30 from *sporting*
@entity75 could also provide versatility to @entity27 's side
but moves for @entity90 and @entity102 seem unlikely
@entity62 of @entity64 and has also been linked with @entity25
