@entity0 is 28 , and his dream is to own a country farm , have a girlfriend , and drive a jeep			1
it 's not a huge dream , but for @entity0 , who lives in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in @entity10 's capital city of @entity11 , relies on his parents for everything , and stands at just 27 inches tall , it might as well involve building a castle made of diamonds on the moon			1
until 2009 , @entity0 and his family lived in relative obscurity			1
he had been angry and depressed as a child when he did n't grow while the other children or his siblings did , but he was beginning to accept his fate			0
their only fear was whether or not they mollycoddled him , and whether he would ever be able to cope alone if he needed his younger brothers ' help even to go to the bathroom			0
indeed , as one said : ' he ca n't go around by himself			0
people pick him up as if he 's a toy			2
and then , oof ! we 've lost @entity0			1
' but then , in 2010 , @entity50 , the world 's smallest man , died in @entity52 , and the @entity54 people came calling			1
they measured him , and made him the new record - holder			1
overnight , @entity0 became a superstar , hoisted onto the shoulders of the world 's media and bounced into the spotlight			1
' i was so happy i almost cried , ' he said			0
' i was the shortest man in the world			2
the only one smaller than all the other kids			0
' @entity11 : @entity0 and his family live in one of the poorest neighbourhoods in the @entity10 capital the 27 - inch man : @entity0 is considered the baby of the family , despite having several younger siblings a keen dancer , he was thrust onto @entity10 tv wearing sparkly little suits and shimmied his way to stardom			1
he appeared on national chat shows and was paid well for his appearances			0
he was given free medical care and operations for the myriad complaints he 'd had since birth , sometimes in exchange for publicity and campaign backing			0
he even met the @entity10 president at his palace			2
sensing his dreams inching closer , @entity0 visited a @entity89 dealership to test out some models , telling the salesmen he would return to buy one once more money flooded in			2
but , as @entity93 , of @entity54 explained : ' we knew that the reign of @entity0 , as the shortest man , could be very short			1
' in the past : @entity98 says when he was younger he used to get very angry and bad tempered when he did n't grow the record : when @entity0 was named the world 's smallest man he felt so very happy he almost cried just six weeks into @entity0 's record , the world 's smallest teenager - @entity104 , in @entity106 - turned 18 and became eligible for the ' world 's smallest man ' category			1
one inch shorter than @entity0 , it made all the difference			2
he claimed the record and @entity0 became old news			1
suddenly the attention dried up and @entity0 became depressed , missing the stardom he once held			2
' when i first saw him i got really mad and felt in a bad mood , ' @entity0 said			2
' but my mum said i should be happy for him			0
' new title - holder : @entity104 claimed @entity0 's record when he 'd held it for just six weeks stuck in the middle : @entity0 says he likes being both an adult and a child , as people pick him up and kiss him his mother said : ' he 's happy being surrounded by an audience that responds to him			1
it makes him feel special			0
but but when the fuss is over he feels empty and alone			0
he 's sad and unsettled			0
' @entity0 now works with his friend @entity130 in shopping malls , selling himself on still being ' the smallest man in the world '			1
they make about Â£ 50 a day each			0
@entity0 still lives in the moment , but is stuck between being an adult and looking like a child , and never sure which he is			1
but , smiling , he says : ' i like being both a kid and an adult			0
that way everyone likes me			0
they pick me uip and kiss me			0
and they take me on trips			0
