by @entity0 last updated at 11:10 am on 1st december 2011 @entity1 , chief operating officer at the @entity2 , insists that swearing is acceptable in comedies one of the @entity2 ’s top executives caused fury last night after she insisted it is acceptable for comedies to feature expletives			1
@entity1 , the corporation ’s chief operating officer , claimed that one of the points of comedy was to cause offence and make her ‘ flinch ’			1
many of the popular and award - winning shows in the golden age of tv – including @entity19 and @entity20 – never featured such bad language			2
however , yesterday miss @entity1 appeared to condone the use of swearing			1
miss @entity1 admitted that she did flinch at bad language on comedy shows , but said that was part of the reason for the genre			1
i watch comedy shows and flinch , ’ she said			1
‘ but i think sometimes that is one of the points of comedy			1
’ the @entity2 executive claimed there was an ‘ enormous inter-generational difference about what is acceptable ’			2
she added : ‘ it is very tricky because language that will give you offence , wo n’t give me offence			1
and language which gives me serious offence wo n’t give my son offence			1
’ but she pointed out there were lots of guidelines about the use swearing at the @entity2 , including adhering to the watershed			2
@entity49 , director of campaign group @entity50 , said the comments proved she was ‘ out of step with her audience ’			2
she added : ‘ @entity55 do research every year asking if there is too much swearing on tv			2
‘ and more than 50 per cent of viewers say there is too much			2
‘ the idea that bad language in comedy is good – it ’s not big , it ’s not clever and it ’s not funny			1
’ last year , the @entity64 commissioned a survey that found most people believe swearing on television is behind an increase in swearing by young people			2
the poll of more than 800 adults by @entity74 found that most people believe swearing on television is worse now than a decade ago , with women and people over the age of 55 the most concerned by levels of bad language			0
a quarter of people said they had been offended by bad language on tv in the past year			0
miss @entity1 was speaking at a @entity85 and @entity86 conference called @entity87 ? the executive also admitted tv is guilty of copycat programming , with broadcasters behaving like a ‘ herd of sheep ’			1
she said some channels resorted ‘ too easily ’ to ‘ identikit programming ’ where good ideas are ‘ shamelessly and sometimes badly ripped off ’			0
golden age : classic @entity2 comedies like @entity20 were popular yet never featured foul language and she admitted that a few years ago she thought she ‘ would scream ’ if she saw another property makeover show , before it was replaced by a fashion for history shows and cooking			0
miss @entity1 did not single out any broadcaster , but the @entity2 has in the past been criticised – with others – for its reliance on property and cookery shows			1
her remarks echoed those made by sir @entity112 in 2008 when he accused the @entity2 of filling its schedules with derivative and formulaic output			0
last summer , the @entity116 criticised @entity117 and @entity119 ’s daytime programming as too similar , with lots of antiques and property programmes			0
the @entity2 is by no means alone in having filled schedules with these types of shows			0
it still airs property shows such as @entity127 , @entity128 , and to @entity129			0
@entity130 has may the @entity131 and @entity132 is known for @entity133			0
miss @entity1 also said that by the @entity2 taking over direct control of the @entity136 , it will allow the corporation to remove ‘ duplication ’			1
the executive , who earned £ 385,000 last year , admitted : ‘ i think there are three different bureaus in @entity142			0
that is not a sensible way to spend money			0
’ she added that the @entity2 was ‘ ruthlessly prioritising ’ its spending in sport			0
this comes as the @entity150 controller @entity151 admitted his channel was set to see a large increase in repeats due to cuts .			0
