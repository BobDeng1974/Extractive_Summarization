by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 showed their strength by overpowering @entity4 to record a 6 - 3 victory at @entity6 on saturday and move top of the @entity9 table			1
in an enthralling clash between @entity13 's men and @entity15 's side , the teams shared nine goals and there were several controversial refereeing decisions to add to a dramatic game			1
find out how the players fared in the @entity9 contest			2
@entity29 - 6 provided a brilliant cross for @entity4 ’s first goal and was his usual energetic self but his own goal proved decisive in the ebb and flow of the contest			1
@entity38 - 4.5 not a performance he will look back on with any fondness whatsoever			0
@entity23 ’s physicality and movement caused him numerous problems and he left the field distraught			2
nightmare : @entity38 ( right ) and @entity46 were bullied by @entity23 and struggled all game @entity46 - 4.5 had a goal correctly ruled out in the first half when he was offside but , like @entity38 , he will be glad to consign this game to history			1
too slow to close @entity52 down for @entity2 ’s fourth goal			1
@entity54 - 5.5 pinpoint delivery provided @entity56 with a debut goal			1
he kept ploughing a furrow up the left flank but struggled to get much change out of @entity61			2
@entity62 - 6 what you see is what you get from @entity62			0
never gives up and uses the ball well but this was n’t an easy contest against the hulking @entity52			2
decent : @entity62 ( left ) did an ok job for @entity4 but he was simply out - fought by powerful @entity52 @entity72 - 6 he was excellent against @entity73 but did n’t reach the same levels here			1
fought hard to try and wrestle the initative off @entity52 but had to admit defeat in the end			2
@entity78 - 6 @entity79 in the second half and played a smart ball into @entity82 for @entity4 ’s third goal but substituted shortly after and his @entity4 career is yet to take off			1
@entity82 - 7 continued his bright start to the campaign with a third goal in as many games			1
never stopped trying and his runs from deep kept @entity90 and @entity91 on their toes			0
form : @entity82 scored his third goal in as many games for @entity4 and impressed once more @entity95 - 7 magnificent header just before half - time changed the atmosphere and lit the fuse for a wonderful second half			1
continues to fulfil an important role with his use of the ball and speed			0
@entity106 - 5 did n’t enjoy any kind of fond reunion with his former employers			0
his run opened the space for @entity82 to score @entity4 ’s third goal but , other than that , there was n’t much for him to cheer			1
@entity118 @entity56 - 7 took his goal well off the bench against his former side			1
@entity123 unused @entity125 ( gk ) , @entity124 , @entity126 , stones , @entity128 @entity130 face : @entity4 striker @entity56 scored a header on his debut against former club @entity2 @entity2 @entity133 - 6.5 beaten three times but not at fault for any of them			1
commands his area well and is never afraid to charge from his line to try and claim aerial balls			0
@entity61 - 7 does n’t command headlines but his importance for this @entity2 team can not be underestimated			1
his standards rarely dip and he always pops up with a goal , as he did here			0
@entity91 - 8 will be furious that he has come off the pitch having conceded three goals			0
some of his tackling and intercepting was of the highest class and kept @entity106 under lock and key			0
dominant : despite conceding three goals , @entity2 defender @entity91 was brilliant and commanding at back @entity157 - 7.5 again , like @entity91 , the goals @entity2 shipped will colour his view of the win			1
but when @entity4 tried to get a foothold in the game he was not found wanting			0
@entity163 - 6.5 needs to up his game with @entity167 breathing down his neck			0
steady and reliable , stuck to his guns in the second half when @entity4 tried to turn up the pressure			0
@entity52 - 8.5 an absolute monster			2
gets better every time you see him and by the end of the season he will be saluted as the finest defensive midfielder in the country			0
scored the decisive fourth , too			0
powerhouse : @entity2 midfielder @entity52 ( centre ) bagged a goal and dominated the midfield play @entity186 - 7.5 another to get on the scoresheet and provided an assist too			1
linked well with @entity52 and covered every blade of grass , @entity191 - 6.5 industrious but not the flashiest performance			2
kept the ball , charged forward when the chance allowed			0
fulfils a crucial role in this team			0
@entity197 - 7.5 easy to see why @entity13 wanted to sign him and his effortless passing is making @entity2 a much more attractive side to watch ; delightful weight on his ball to @entity23 for the opener			1
poise : @entity197 ( left ) makes @entity2 far more attractive on the eye with some beautiful passing @entity207 - 7.5 some flashes of brilliance , like when he created the third goal			2
even when he is n’t in the game for long periods , you always get the sense he is capable of bursting into life			0
@entity23 - 9 he is a match winner , plain and simple			2
if he carries on at this rate , he will get close to 30 goals this season			0
needs to eliminate the unnecessary squabbling with opponents though			0
clinical : @entity2 striker @entity23 ( right ) nets the first of his two goals against @entity4 at @entity6 @entity118 @entity226 @entity167 @entity227 unused @entity228 ( gk ) , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 @entity232 performer : @entity23 looks to the sky in celebration after bagging a brace against @entity4 on saturday			1
