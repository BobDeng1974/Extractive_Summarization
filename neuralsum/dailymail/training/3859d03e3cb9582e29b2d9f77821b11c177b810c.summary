by @entity1 reporter with the summer in full swing and temperatures rising , it may seem like a great idea to take a cool dip in the ocean , but according to a new report , some beach - goers may be getting more than they bargained for			0
ten percent of water samples taken from @entity13 coastal and lake beaches fail to meet safety standards set by the @entity13 @entity16 , a new report finds			1
' there can be hidden dangers lurking in many of our waterways in the form of bacteria and viruses that can cause a great inventory of illnesses like dysentery , hepatitis , stomach flu , infections and rashes , ' @entity17 , water program director for the @entity19 , said			0
of nearly 3,500 samples taken annually at beaches around the country , @entity37 beaches have the highest failure rate , with excessively high bacteria levels , the defense council said			2
@entity43 in the dirt : @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity45 was labelled as a ' repeat offender ' with poor water quality polluted : @entity50 in @entity51 in @entity52 was on the @entity19 's list of repeat offenders nasty : @entity55 in @entity56 had water samples below safety standards @entity59 : @entity60 , 50 yards @entity61 of the pier , in @entity63 @entity64 : @entity65 in @entity66 @entity52 : @entity50 in @entity51 @entity67 : @entity68 in @entity69 @entity56 : @entity55 in @entity56 @entity45 : @entity70 in @entity71 the findings confirm that water pollution caused by storm - water runoff and sewage overflows persists at many @entity13 beaches , the agency said			1
storm - water runoff often includes trash , chemicals , oil and animal and human waste as well as bacteria and viruses			0
' it 's really all of our urban slobber going untreated into local waterways , ' @entity17 said			0
swimming in bacteria - infested waters can cause stomach flu , skin rashes and pinkeye			0
the report stated that children tend to be most susceptible to these and other waterborne illnesses likely because they tend to submerge their heads			0
beaches in @entity59 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity56 , @entity45 , @entity100 and @entity101 were listed as ‘ repeat offenders			1
’ sickening : two - thirds of beach closings and advisories were caused by bacteria levels surpassing public health standards hazardous : it may look pristine , but @entity110 , 50 yards east of the pier , in @entity63 had violations @entity113 : @entity115 - @entity114 in @entity116 @entity117 : @entity118 in @entity119 @entity120 : @entity121 in @entity122 @entity52 : singing beach in @entity124 @entity56 : @entity125 at 96th st. in @entity126 @entity99 fared particularly poorly , with 29 per cent of the reported water samples below safety standards , followed by @entity100 , @entity98 and @entity64			1
a dozen @entity13 beaches received a five - star rating indicating strong testing and safety practices , as well as low violation rates			1
the agency singled out 35 popular ' superstar ' beaches that have excellent water quality			1
each of these met national water quality standards 98 percent of the time over the past five years			1
silver lining : despite a number of beaches violating national recommended health standards , @entity143 in @entity45 was names as one of the cleanest the nation in the @entity37 , 13 percent of samples failed to meet federal public health standards , the researchers said			2
other regions with excessively high bacteria in swimming water samples include : the @entity156 ( 12 percent ) , @entity157 ( 11 percent ) , the western coast ( 9 percent ) , @entity45 and @entity56 coasts ( 7 percent ) , and the southeast ( 7 percent )			1
states with the highest failure rates include : @entity100 ( 35 percent ) , @entity163 ( 24 percent ) and @entity164 ( 21 percent )			0
for cleaner water , try the @entity167 area on the @entity168 , where 4 percent of samples failed the test			2
three states had a failure rate of just 3 percent : @entity113 , @entity174 and @entity56 , the researchers found			0
beach - goers who wish to avoid swimming in polluted waters are advised to choose beaches away from urban areas ; stay away from pipes that drain storm water runoff ; and avoid swimming for at least a day after heavy rains			2
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has estimated that up to 3.5million people become ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary sewer overflows each year , and that number could even be higher since many people who become ill after swimming in polluted water are unaware of the underlying cause of their symptoms , and it often goes unreported			0
unsafe : @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity100 is among @entity19 's ' repeat offenders			2

10 *%* of water samples from @entity13 beaches fail standards for swimmer safety
35 beaches rated as ' superstars ' for water quality
