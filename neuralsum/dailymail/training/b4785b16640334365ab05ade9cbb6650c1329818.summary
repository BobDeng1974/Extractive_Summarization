sleeping pills taken by celebrities including @entity2 and @entity3 – and prescribed widely in @entity4 – could be to blame for numerous cases of dangerous and even criminal behaviour			1
@entity7 , which is handed out to 750,000 @entity10 patients seeking treatment for insomnia each year , has been found to be a factor in dozens of instances of people breaking the law while sleeping			1
they include 43 instances of driving , nine rapes , eight assaults , ten murders or manslaughters , and burglaries – all of which were claimed to have been carried out while the perpetrator was apparently asleep			1
in most cases they also had no memory of the event			0
‘ in sleep - driving for example , people take the drug , go to bed , and then wake up in the car with their pyjamas on			1
when the police pull them over , they do not know how they got there			0
’ prof @entity33 , of the @entity53 , adds : ‘ one of the difficulties in advising people about taking the drug is that it is effective and there does not seem to be any way of identifying people at risk of these uncommon side effects			1
’ some 82 medication - related cases worked on since 2006 involved ‘ toxicity ’ due to @entity7			2
in 79 of the cases the defence was successful			0
@entity7 – also known by its @entity35 brand name @entity7 – works by dampening the electrical activity of the brain			0
troubled actress @entity2 has admitted to problems while taking @entity7			1
initially marketed two decades ago as a safer alternative to older , more addictive benzodiazepine drugs , including @entity73 , in recent years @entity7 , along with similar so - called z - drugs such as zopiclone , have been linked to a raised risk of dementia and heart problems			2
numerous studies have reported rare instances of patients driving , eating , making telephone calls and even having sex while under the influence of the medication			1
some experts even recommend that patients secure their bedroom windows and get into bed before taking the drug , to reduce any possibility of harm			2
police have found at least 43 people driving while asleep after taking sleeping pill @entity7 ( file picture ) one report , by doctors at the @entity97 , claimed that up to one per cent of patients had a sleep - eating problem after taking the sedative			1
the only clues to their nocturnal feasting were morning leftovers and crumbs in the bed			0
patients being prescribed @entity7 are already warned that changes in sleep behaviour , including sleepwalking , are a possible side effect , but this is the first time data on criminal behaviour linked to the drug has been comprehensively collected			1
new @entity35 research shows that the drug is implicated in one in ten emergency department cases due to psychiatric drugs			2
in over- 65s , it accounted for 21 per cent of cases			0
one theory is that the events actually occur while people are waking from deep sleep			2
although prescribing guidelines state @entity7 should be used only in the short term , with an initial two - week course recommended , a recent study by herbal sleep aid company @entity126 found that up to 42 per cent of patients on sleeping pills had been taking them for more than a decade , and a quarter for between three and five years			1
and , according to the @entity134 , one in ten of us now regularly takes some form of sleeping tablet			0
zolpidem – also known by its @entity35 brand name @entity7 – works by dampening the electrical activity of the brain dr @entity142 , consultant neurologist at @entity143 ’s and @entity144 ’ hospitals in @entity146 , says : ‘ these drugs tend to be habit - forming and can have unintended consequences such as these unwanted behaviours			2
’ mild and fleeting , so - called confusional arousals , such as waking up in a hotel room with no idea where you are , are common , especially in people who are over-tired			0
some researchers say the events seen in users of the drug occur during these arousals , and point out that no drug has ever been shown in laboratory studies to cause sleepwalking , a phenomenon that happens when the cortex is asleep but areas of the brain concerned with movement are active			0
dr @entity142 adds : ‘ this sedative may , at least in some people , uncover an underlying predisposition to these sleep disorders , like sleepwalking			0
‘ during these events , parts of the brain appear to remain asleep while other parts responsible for complex behaviours are awake			0
