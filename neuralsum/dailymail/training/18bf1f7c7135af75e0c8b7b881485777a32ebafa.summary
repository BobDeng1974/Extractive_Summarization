@entity0 was given too many sedatives at @entity2 in @entity3 which led to him falling and dying a grandfather with dementia suffered a fatal fall in hospital after being given a cocktail of drugs to ‘ keep him quiet ’			1
@entity0 , 76 , smashed his head on the floor and suffered a brain haemorrhage after excessive amounts of sedatives left him ‘ practically delirious ’			1
nurses found him , unconscious and bleeding , 40 minutes after he was given three doses of powerful drugs in just five minutes			1
the married father of four , who had been admitted to hospital with bowel problems , died five days after the fall			1
the @entity25 trust in question has apologised and admitted full responsibility for mr @entity0 ’s death , after his family instructed lawyers to investigate whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy			1
staff had failed to act after a risk assessment recommended steps to prevent the retired steel worker from seriously injuring himself on the ward			0
the @entity37 has long called for an improvement in care of dementia sufferers as part of its dignity for the @entity44 campaign			0
yesterday mr @entity0 ’s family told of their anger and devastation at how he was stripped of his dignity , and given a chemical cosh by those who should have been caring for him			1
@entity56 , 44 , said : ‘ @entity58 ’s dementia meant he did need a lot of care – but rather than reassuring him and trying to keep him occupied , it came to light at the inquest that the medical staff just kept increasing his sedation levels			2
‘ in the end he was practically delirious from all the drugs he had been given , but no steps were taken by the nurses to prevent him from being a danger to himself			2
‘ we ’ve been left devastated by the way @entity58 was treated			0
he should have been shown some dignity and respect in his final days , but sadly the main goal of the nurses and doctors was to keep him quiet			0
the hospital have apologised , but the apology felt empty			0
’ chief executive of the hospital @entity77 said : ' i wish to reiterate the @entity80 's sincere apologies to his family for the fatal head injury mr @entity0 sustained after falling in our care ' research by the @entity85 has shown that one in four dementia sufferers are treated with ' last resort ' antipsychotic @entity88 are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in patients with mental illnesses			1
but researchers have found that in most cases they are just given to sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off			0
the drugs – dubbed a ‘ chemical cosh ’ – have been found to double the risk of death and actually worsen patients ’ symptoms leaving them unable to walk or speak coherently			1
in 2011 , the @entity101 warned the drugs were leading to 1,800 needless deaths a year			2
around 770,000 @entity104 are thought to have some form of dementia , including alzheimer ’s disease			0
but it is not known how many are being given antipsychotics or how long they have been on them			0
research has also shown that dementia patients in care homes in some parts of @entity115 are six times more likely to be prescribed the drugs than in other areas			0
mr @entity0 , of @entity119 , @entity120 , was given a sedative soon after being admitted to @entity2 in @entity3 on january 3 , 2011			1
the doses continued throughout the following days , despite a doctor expressing concerns that he should not receive any more drugs			2
three days later , a falls risk - assessment identified him as a high - risk patient			2
as a result , a care plan recommended additional night staff to help care for him , and for a nurse to be visible at all times			0
it also suggested lowering his bed			0
none of these steps were taken , and on january 17 mr @entity0 suffered the fall which later killed him			1
x-rays show he suffered a severe brain haemorrhage			1
he had been married to @entity141 , 72 , for 40 years , and had ten grandchildren			0

‘ the hospital report says he was given @entity148			2
five minutes later he was given 1milligram of @entity149 and 50mg of @entity150			1
just 40 minutes later he was found on the floor by nurses			2
’ a post-mortem examination found that mr @entity0 ’s system contained high levels of the three aforementioned drugs , as well as another sedative , @entity158			1
an inquest last september found mr @entity0 died as a result of the head injury sustained in the fall			1
in a narrative verdict , the coroner noted a ‘ continuing use of excess sedation ’ and an ‘ ongoing omission to fully comply with fall - prevention policies ’			0
@entity77 , chief executive of @entity80 , said : ‘ i wish to reiterate the trust ’s sincere apologies to mr @entity0 ’s family for the fatal head injury he sustained after falling in our care			1
’ the trust – one of six branded ‘ high risk ’ for patient care by the @entity179 last week – is addressing several failings that were identified in an internal investigation			0
these steps include new guidelines for sedating agitated patients , and providing more dementia support on every ward .			0

a post-mortem examination found he had huge levels of the sedative drugs @entity149 , @entity148 , @entity158 and @entity150 in his system
the @entity80 has admitted responsibility for mr @entity0 's death
