@entity0 lost the plot after @entity3 ’s unbeaten run against @entity4 increased to 12 games after @entity7 ’s 2 - 0 victory at @entity8			1
the @entity4 manager insisted he had no regrets for the shove on @entity3 when his incredible @entity13 clash erupted after just 20 minutes			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t regret it , what is there to regret ? i want to go from a to b and someone ( @entity3 ) confronted me before i got to b without any sign of a welcome			1
’ @entity0 shoves @entity3 in the chest with about 20 minutes gone at @entity8 on sunday @entity0 , 64 , pushed @entity3 in the chest with the @entity22 manager of @entity7 stumbling backwards @entity0 squares up to @entity7 manager @entity3 on the touchline during sunday 's @entity13 match @entity0 and @entity3 had to be separated by fourth official @entity25 as their rivalry showed itself it 's the longest - running feud in the @entity13 ... but where did it start ? @entity7 took the lead when @entity30 scored with a penalty and former @entity4 midfielder @entity32 set up @entity33 for his ninth goal this season			1
@entity0 claimed @entity36 should have already been sent off for the foul on @entity38 that provoked the flare - up between the two technical areas			1
the @entity4 chief , whose side are now a staggering nine points behind league leaders @entity7 , also claimed @entity45 and @entity46 should have been sent off			1
@entity0 will face no further action from the @entity48 because it was dealt with at the time by referee @entity50 and fourth official @entity25			1
@entity0 will also have to deal with an open show of dissent from @entity53 and @entity54 when they were substituted on sunday			1
both shook their heads repeatedly at the decision when they walked off the pitch and again when they sat on the substitutes ’ bench in the second half			2
he said : ‘ a red card for @entity36 would n’t surprise you if you watched it again			1
i went to @entity38 to see how badly he was injured			1
@entity36 lunges in on @entity38 during the feisty @entity67 derby between rivals @entity7 and @entity4 @entity36 goes through @entity38 to get the ball and it started the feud between managers @entity0 and @entity3 @entity36 fouls @entity38 , @entity4 's new signing from @entity74 , and was yellow carded by referee @entity50 a one - man team ? @entity7 are so much more than that this season			1
those who believe the title race rests on the hamstrings of @entity33 may have to reconsider after this			2
for a good 75 minutes , @entity4 snuffed out @entity33 ’s threat			1
@entity7 were still on course for victory , through the quite brilliant @entity30			1
click here for @entity88 's full match report from @entity8 ‘ @entity45 was lucky to stay on the pitch with his repeated fouling and he was only booked in the 88th minute			1
then there is @entity46 as well with bad fouls , but it ’s down to the referee , not to me			2
‘ i trust you will all teach me the moral lessons over the next two weeks and i can accept that			2
i am long enough in the game to see things the right way			0
i do n’t listen to what @entity3 says			1
‘ you would see if i really tried to push you , come on			0
’ on sunday night , @entity7 goalkeeper @entity104 was undergoing neurological tests in a local hospital after he was forced off with concussion			1

he continued but was substituted with blood pouring from his ear 14 minutes later and replaced by former @entity7 no 1 @entity114			1
@entity104 is in the @entity117 squad for @entity119 qualifiers with @entity120 on friday and @entity121 the following week , but it seems unlikely that he will take part			0
@entity104 suffered a blow when he came out to challenge @entity38 but he played on afterwards @entity38 immediately showed concern for @entity104 as the @entity7 goalkeeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch @entity104 is escorted up the tunnel and the no 1 @entity7 goalkeeper was immediately treated by paramedics @entity3 said : ‘ he has gone to hospital for a precaution , but we think nothing special will happen			1
‘ on the bench i do n't communicate with the doctors			0
can he stay ? yes			0
he has to leave ? okay			0
first they said yes he could continue , then no. i was just worried for the kid			0
‘ i was not worried about the game or the performance : we have two of the three best keepers in the world , so when one is injured and comes off , no problem , no change in the team			0
i was confident that @entity114 would do a fantastic job for us			0
‘ we have dr @entity149 , the head of the medical department , and he has his people			0
i always tell them that , when i 'm on the bench , i do n't want to communicate with them			0
i just want them to give me a decision			0
‘ they gave me their decision			0
for me , that 's correct			2
the club doctor or medical department should take control and responsibility			0
’ @entity3 , who failed to shake hands with @entity0 at the final whistle , claimed there is no issue with the @entity4 manager after their latest heated skirmish			1

‘ i think these conditions make a game of emotions			0
after that , there are two technical areas			0
one for me , one for him			0
‘ he was coming into my technical area and not for the right reasons , to give some technical instructions			0
he was coming to push the referee for a red card , and i did n't like that			2
but i think @entity25 did a good job			2
‘ a football pitch is a football pitch			0
he did well , @entity25			2
and @entity50 did well too			2
‘ but , to be fair , i do so many wrong things in football , sometimes you lose emotion , but not this time			0
