it is a noise that only two per cent of people can hear , but this low droning sound would be enough to drive anyone mad			1
scientists have been left baffled because they ca n’t figure out what causes a phenomenon called @entity7 , or why it affects so few people			1
sufferers have identified common factors : the humming is only heard indoors , it is a low , rumbling noise , it is louder at night , and is more common in more rural areas , reported @entity14			1
a 2003 study by acoustical consultant @entity30 , from @entity31 , shows that one in 50 people who live in a @entity7 - prone place hear the noise , and that most of these people are aged between 55 and 70			1
@entity36 , from @entity16 , told the @entity37 : ‘ it 's a kind of torture ; sometimes , you just want to scream			0
‘ it 's hard to get off to sleep because i hear this throbbing sound in the background			1
you 're tossing and turning , and you get more and more agitated about it			0
’ those who hear it can experience headaches , nausea , dizziness , nosebleeds and sleep disturbances , and the @entity37 reported at least one suicide as a result of the noise			1
annoying : @entity22 was one of the first places in the world to record the noise			1
it was heard by approximately 800 people in the 1970s unidentifiable : the noise has even been heard in the town of @entity25 in @entity26			1
they were unable to identify the cause often sufferers otherwise have perfectly normal hearing , and @entity7 goes away when they leave a certain area			2
the ‘ @entity70 ’ was one of the first reported in the world			0
around 800 people said they could hear the noise in the 1970s			2
it was eventually blamed on traffic and local factories			0
in @entity25 , @entity26 , a group of researchers from @entity78 , the @entity79 , were unable to identify the source of @entity7 in the early 1990s			2
one resident of @entity27 in @entity28 told the @entity82 : ‘ it sends people around here crazy — all you can do is put music on to block it out			0
some people leave fans on			0
’ unsolved : people in the @entity24 seaside town of @entity23 have reported the mysterious @entity7 too surf 's up : one resident of @entity27 in @entity28 told the @entity82 that it sends people around the area crazy some suggest that the noise is in fact tinnitus , a condition that makes the sufferer hear noise that is n’t there , but it is thought that the noise is in fact real			1
suspected sources are industrial equipment , gas lines , power lines , and wireless communication , despite few cases being linked to them			0
others suggest that it is a result of low - frequency electromagnetic radiation or seismic activity such as microseisms that are only perceptible to a select few			0
although , some experts have suggested sufferers turn to cognitive behavioural therapy to help deal with the noise			0
but , it is unlikely @entity7 will be solved any time soon			2
@entity30 told the @entity37 : ‘ it 's been a mystery for 40 years , so it may well remain one for a lot longer			0

the @entity7 has been heard in *isolated* places around the world
it can only be *detected* by one in fifty people in those areas
scientists left baffled as they ca n’t figure out what causes the @entity7
those who hear it can experience headaches , nausea , dizziness , nosebleeds and sleep disturbances
