as the daughter of actress @entity2 and film director @entity3 , and the wife of a super-rich banker , @entity0 was never destined for a life on the breadline			1
but even she has astonished her showbusiness friends by buying a £ 27 million @entity10 mansion – for cash			1
the four - storey home has five kingsize bedrooms , five bathrooms , an underground pool , a gym , and a lift to take cars to the basement garage			1
extravagant : the red - brick mansion with a neo-classical facade was torn down by the previous owners but it is not to everyone ’s taste – one neighbour has described it as looking like a ‘ down - market mortuary ’			1
the purchase comes after ms @entity0 , 49 , made a handsome profit on the sale of her previous flat , in @entity32			1
cash buyers : @entity0 , 49 , pictured with her hedge fund boss husband @entity34 , 51 @entity36 documents show that she sold that seven - bedroom home for £ 43 million in february			1
she and her hedge fund boss husband @entity34 , 51 , had bought it for £ 18.5 million in 2007 , before spending large sums on revamping it			1
registry records show there is no mortgage on the couple ’s new home			0
ms @entity0 and mr @entity34 moved into her new - build house with their children , @entity50 , 19 , and @entity51 , 16 , in february			1
@entity52 have expressed mixed views about the house , which was completed this year after a two - year build			2
it replaced a red - brick mansion with a neo-classical facade that was torn down by the previous owners			2
although the architects said they designed the new yellow - brick house to blend in with other @entity64 and @entity65 townhouses in the conservation area , some residents complain that it ‘ just sticks out ’			2
one neighbour said : ‘ apparently the council approved it , which is outrageous			0
‘ in an area like this it ’s important the buildings fit a certain look			0
but it just sticks out , it does n’t look like anything that belongs here			0
’ another resident added : ‘ it looks like a downmarket mortuary			0
there was more taste to how it was before			0
now it looks like a council estate			0
’ @entity10 property developers have revealed that the sale of ms @entity0 ’s previous apartment for £ 43 million made it one of the most expensive flats in the @entity89			1
the priciest apartment in the @entity89 is believed to be in the one @entity92 development in @entity93 , which sold for £ 140 million last year			0
@entity94 , a solicitor acting for ms @entity0 and mr @entity34 , said it was ‘ inaccurate ’ to say that she made a profit of £ 24.5 million on their previous flat as the couple spent considerable amounts of money refurbishing it before selling it			1
mr @entity94 added that his clients ’ property affairs were a ‘ private matter ’			0
ms @entity108 ’s mother , 80 , is famous for her roles in the 1970s @entity89 film classics @entity111 and @entity112 , both of which were directed by mr @entity3			2
