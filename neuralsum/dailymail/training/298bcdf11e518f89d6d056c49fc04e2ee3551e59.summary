these are the two brave little battlers who have both beaten eye cancer			1
identical twins @entity3 and @entity5 have both undergone a mammoth battle for survival after both being diagnosed with the deadly disease just twelve months after they were born			1
they have undergone gruelling treatment and @entity5 has lost one eye - but both have come out the other side smiling			1
@entity15 and @entity16 with their twin daughters @entity3 and @entity5 , who have both beaten eye cancer mother @entity15 , 25 , said : ‘ it was such an unlucky thing to happen , that both the twins had eye cancer			1
but we feel incredibly lucky to be in this position now			0
‘ it ’s incredible to see what they have been through - and they have both come through the other side			0
' ms @entity15 , who lives with partner @entity16 , 38 , a train guard , in @entity31 , @entity32 , had been thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant with twins			0
she said : ‘ i ’m a twin myself , but i never imagined that i would fall pregnant with twins myself			0
when the sonographer said she could see two heartbeats on the scan , it was such a surprise			0
’ her pregnancy went smoothly and she gave birth to @entity3 , weighing @entity43 , and @entity5 , weighing @entity44 , at @entity45 in @entity46 , in december 2011			1
@entity3 and @entity5 receive monthly checkups and recent tests show the tumours are dormant in both the girls but when the twins were celebrating their first birthday , she took a photo of them and noticed that @entity5 ’s left eye was n’t quite straight			1
she mentioned it to her health visitor and asked for a referral for a hospital check up			0
she was referred to the opthamology department at the local hospital , who referred her for more tests at the @entity63 in @entity64			0
she said : ‘ i knew that something was n’t quite right with @entity5 ’s eye , but i never imagined it would be anything serious			1
’ the consultant who carried out the tests on @entity5 said that he had seen something behind her eye and wanted to examine her further under a general anaesthetic			1
the operation was carried out the following morning and then doctors broke the devastating news to the couple that @entity5 had retinoblastoma , a childhood eye cancer			1
‘ we were completely stunned			0
we had never even heard of this eye cancer , and we had never imagined that it could be anything like cancer			1
at that point it never occurred to us that @entity3 could have it as well - we were only thinking of how @entity5 was going to get through it			1
’ further tests showed that @entity5 had multiple tumours in her left eye and they were graded e , the most serious form of the disease			1
she was blind in that eye and had been for months			2
she also had tumors in her right eye too			2
doctors told the couple that they had to make a heart rendering decision			2
the only way to save @entity5 ’s life was to remove her eye			1
@entity3 pictured with her father @entity16 and at hospital during her chemotherapy treatment for eye cancer			1
she was diagnosed with the disease in an earlier stage than her sister and it was treated with chemotherapy ‘ it was devastating for her to lose her eye			1
but it was the only way to save her life			2
it was the worst decision we have had to make , but there was no choice			1
it was her eye or her life			2
’ a week later , in april last year , the operation was carried out at @entity120 , and she had a metal implant put in			0
the following day @entity3 was checked by doctors , and they made the devastating discovery that she had eye cancer too , in both her eyes			1
retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina - is a rare type of eye cancer which usually affects children younger than five			1
the disease causes the retina cells to grow quickly and out - of - control			2
while treating it usually involves laser treatment , freezing the tumour or heat therapy , larger tumours can require chemotherapy , or surgery to remove the eye			1
however , more than 98 per cent of children with retinoblastoma are successfully treated			0
signs to look out for include : * a white eye or white reflection which can be seen in a photograph * a squint * a red sore or swollen eye * a change in colour to the iris * deterioration in vision ‘ it was too much to take in			2
we were in utter shock			0
we ’d just had one child lose her eye , and now we were being told our other daughter had it too			2
the thought of two children having cancer was just horrendous			2
’ luckily @entity3 ’s cancer was n’t as far advanced as her sister , so she did n’t have to have an eye removed			1
she underwent six months of chemotherapy which finished in september			1
ms @entity15 said : ‘ she coped really well			0
she was sick and exhausted and she lost her hair			0
but she managed to come through it			0
we are very proud of them both			0
’ @entity5 also had laser treatment on her remaining eye to shrink the tumours , and recent check - ups have shown the tumours are now dormant in both the girls			1
‘ it is such a relief that they are both doing so well			0
the tumours are dormant and they do have monthly check - ups			2
‘ they have so much more energy now , @entity3 especially now she has finished her chemotherapy			2
‘ it was such a relief that i asked the health visitor to check @entity5 when i did , because it would n’t have been picked up otherwise			2
and having @entity5 treated has saved @entity3 too			1
‘ when i look at the two of them together it ’s very emotional , knowing what they have been through			0
and i feel like the luckiest mum in the world to have them both with me			0
’ mr @entity16 added : ‘ it ’s wonderful that both the girls have come through the other side of eye cancer			1
it was frightening when they were first diagnosed with it			0
to have them both battle through it has been extremely difficult			0
but thankfully both the girls are now doing really well			0
we are very proud of them both			0
the family have been supported by the @entity205			0
