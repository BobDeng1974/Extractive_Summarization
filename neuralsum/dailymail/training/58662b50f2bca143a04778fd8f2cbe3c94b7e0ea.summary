by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:18 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 developed a clot in her leg known as @entity6 each year , one in every 1,000 @entity8 develops deep vein thrombosis - a blood clot in a large vein			1
this can cause permanent vein damage , raising the risk of further clots			1
@entity3 , 25 , a communications assistant from @entity16 , @entity17 , was the first person in the world to undergo a new treatment to reduce the symptoms and prevent a second dvt , as she tells @entity22			1
lying on the sofa one night , i suddenly felt intense pain in my groin			1
i thought it was due to the position i 'd been in , so did n't think anything more of it , and went to bed			1
when i woke up the next morning , the pain was worse and had spread down my right leg			1
i was in agony and my leg was red and swollen to twice its size			1
i could barely walk and could n't bend my knee			1
i managed to take myself to hospital , where doctors found i had a deep vein thrombosis in my groin			2
part of the clot had broken off and gone to my lung			2
it turned out i have a genetic condition which means i do n't make enough of the protein that prevents clots forming			2
my mum and sister have since been tested , and they also have the @entity51 spent a week in hospital			2
i was given painkillers and the blood - thinning drug acenocoumarol			1
the doctors prescribed compression stockings for the swelling			2
this was three years ago , and since then the @entity21 has really impacted my life			2
my leg would get swollen and red in hot weather , or if i 'd been standing for a while			2
i had to monitor my diet , as high levels of vitamin k - found in leafy green vegetables and some cereals - can stop the medication working properly			2
i had to avoid alcohol for the same reason			2
i needed monthly tests to check my blood for clots and doctors adjusted my dose of medication often			1
then aged 22 , i found the compression stockings a hassle			2
they were hard to put on and could get uncomfortable			2
i had to wear them all the time - and they 're not the sort of thing you want to wear with a short skirt			2
last year , i found a pea - sized lump in my right groin			2
it was n't painful and i could only feel it when standing , so i did n't panic			2
after a month , i saw my gp for my regular check			2
he referred me to @entity94 to make sure the lump was n't a hernia			2
a scan revealed it was a varicose vein			2
because the clot left my veins badly damaged and scarred , blood was not moving properly through my leg , causing a vein to bulge out under the skin , as too much blood was collecting in it			1
and there was a risk of another clot			0
i first saw mr @entity109 , a consultant vascular surgeon at the hospital , last november			0
he told me about a new treatment using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open to allow blood to flow normally			1
this would reduce the risk of clots and mean no more swelling , pain or compression stockings			0
the operation would take only an hour and a half			0
@entity3 had a pioneering new procedure using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open i had the operation in january this year			1
i stayed in hospital for a night , and the next day i could almost walk normally			0
one month on , i do n't have any pain			0
i still have to take medication , because of my genetic condition , but i 'm now on a new blood - thinning drug called rivaroxaban			1
before , i needed to take different doses on different days , but this was one daily pill			0
in a couple of months , i wo n't need compression stockings and my leg should be back to the size it was before the @entity21			0
@entity109 is a consultant vascular surgeon at @entity94 in @entity141 , @entity140 is a blood clot that develops in a large vein , usually in the leg			1
normally , blood flows quickly through veins , but factors such as being inactive can slow down this flow and trigger clots			1
patients who have recently undergone surgery are particularly at risk			0
about a third develop a clot extending from lower in the leg to the upper thigh or groin			0
@entity3 's clot extended from her knee into her pelvis			1
the higher the clot , the greater the risk of a bit breaking off and travelling to the lungs			0
called a pulmonary embolism , this may be fatal in around one in ten people			0
untreated , it can cause cardiac arrest , as the lung clot can cut off blood flow to the heart			1
another issue is the clot remaining in a vein for too long			0
the blockage can damage the vein , creating scar tissue , which restricts blood flow			1
blood - thinning drugs such as warfarin are common treatments			1
but these do n't dissolve the clot , they thin the blood and prevent further clots			1
doctors can try to break up the clot with special clot - busting drugs			0
however , these increase the risk of internal bleeding , so are only used in chronic cases			0
doctors have also tried using stents in patients with @entity21			0
stents are tiny cylindrical mesh tubes that act like scaffolding , widening a damaged blood vessel so blood can flow normally			1
while the stent does n't remove the clot , it reduces the risk of a new dvt			1
but the success of stents in veins has been variable , as previously they 've only been designed for arteries			1
veins are larger and more powerful , so the stent becomes blocked or crushed			1
however , a stronger stent has been developed in the @entity213 for veins			1
i set up a programme at @entity94 's , helped by professor @entity217 , a stent pioneer who is retired but is chair of the @entity221			0
the treatment is a team effort			1
one month on , she has no pain @entity3 was the first patient to be treated with this new stent			1
called the @entity228 , it has the same strength end - to - end , so is crush - resistant			0
it 's made from nitinol - nickel and titanium - which is more flexible than other metals			0
kept cold outside of the body , it can be compressed to a very small size , meaning we can make a smaller incision to place it			0
once inserted , it expands and reaches full strength at body temperature			0
it is also slightly larger than a normal stent			0
stent treatment is not suitable for patients with clots lower down the leg , as the veins are too small			1
this new stent is remarkably effective			0
long - term studies in the @entity213 suggest nearly three - quarters of patients will be pain - free , and around half will no longer have swelling			0
the stents work in 90 per cent of cases			0
although @entity3 had recovered from her dvt , the veins in the pelvis had chronic scarring			1
this restricted blood flow and she was at risk of further clots			1
under general anaesthetic , we make a small incision , either inside the lower thigh , just above or behind the knee			0
a thin tube ( catheter ) is inserted and this releases the stent into the vein			1
we use x-ray and a special device called intravascular ultrasound , a miniature machine that goes inside the vein , to see where the damage is and make sure we put in the right number of stents			0
patients need between one and four , depending on the extent of damage			0
after the operation , we put a stocking on her leg and fitted special boots connected to a pump via flexible tubes to keep blood flowing normally , until she was up and walking the next day			1
some patients may need more than one procedure if the stent shows signs of blocking			0
if there has n't been a problem within six weeks , it 's usually ok long - term			0
we keep patients on blood - thinning drugs for the first six months , just to be sure			1
if there is n't a blockage , there 's no reason the stents wo n't last a lifetime			0
risks include bleeding in less than 1 per cent of cases ( it 's higher in the over- 75s ) and pulmonary embolism , also in less than 1 per cent of cases			0
each stent costs £ 1,200			0
the total cost is £ 4,500 if done privately , or around £ 3,000 to the @entity316 .			0

@entity3 , 25 , @entity16 , is first person to undergo dvt treatment
