ever feel like you ’ve been hit on the head after a bad night ’s sleep ? according to scientists , the thought is n’t as far - fetched as it seems			1
a study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head			1
the researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a spike in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage			0
being sleep deprived causes a similar change in the brain to that seen after a head injury - it results in a spike in the chemicals associated with brain injury professor @entity26 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , explained that the chemcials @entity30 and @entity31 are biomarkers for brain damage , such as concussion			2
he said : ‘ what we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night			2
this was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury , for instance , but it was still significant			0
the brain requires sleep to cleanse itself of toxic substances			0
a lack of sleep is associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease and @entity54 's ‘ during sleep , the brain cleans itself of toxic substances and @entity30 and @entity31 increase in response to these substances			1
’ he said the findings back up previous research showing how the brain uses sleep to cleanse itself			0
professor @entity26 also said his study could support previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of @entity72 ’s , @entity54 ’s and multiple sclerosis			1
the rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep is conducive to a loss of brain tissue , he explained			0
professor @entity26 , whose study is published in the journal @entity83 , added : ‘ in conclusion , the findings of our trial indicate a good night ’s sleep may be critical for maintaining brain health			1
’ a third of the @entity93 population suffer from sleep - related problems , while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night , compared with almost nine a few decades ago			2
many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease , while less than eight hours ’ sleep a night can lower the iq the next day .			0

the study results confirm the *importance* of a good night 's sleep
lack of sleep is associated with @entity72 's , @entity54 's and @entity109
