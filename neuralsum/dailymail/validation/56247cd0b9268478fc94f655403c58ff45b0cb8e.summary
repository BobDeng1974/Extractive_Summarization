@entity0 today ambushed @entity1 on live tv by forcing him to agree to take part in a head - to - head election debate on the economy			1
the @entity6 had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would - be chancellors until the leaders ' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely			0
but appearing together on @entity12 , mr @entity0 forced mr @entity1 to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day			1
appearing together on @entity12 , @entity0 forced @entity1 to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day mr @entity0 insisted prime minister @entity18 may be ' scared ' of a one - on - one debate with @entity21 leader @entity20 but he was up for the showdown with mr @entity1			1
after he was put on the spot , the chancellor shook mr @entity0 's hand but suggested @entity26 , @entity27 chief secretary to the treasury , should be included			1
speaking on @entity12 's the @entity28 , mr @entity1 said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place			1
asked if he was keen on the debate , shadow chancellor mr @entity0 replied : ' of course , and i would like to go further			1
@entity1 and i do n't need the broadcasters to sort these things out			1
mr @entity1 tried to claim that his @entity27 deputy @entity26 should be included as well ' @entity1 is not a coward			1
@entity18 does n't want a head - to - head with @entity20 but i 'm very happy - i will have a head - to - head debate , just the two of us , the potential chancellors during the election campaign			0
addressing mr @entity1 , he said : ' you can say now - are you up for it ? ' the chancellor replied : ' as i say , happy to have these chancellors ' debate , just as we did in the last election			1
' mr @entity0 extended his hand out to mr @entity1 to shake on a one - on - one debate , telling the chancellor : ' @entity54 , let 's go for it			1
' mr @entity1 appeared hesitant , saying he would be happy to meet mr @entity0 in a debate			2
he shook the shadow chancellor 's hand , adding to mr @entity0 : ' we 're going to see who else wants to be part of it			1
i have got a very effective chief secretary who i think would also want to be part of that debate			2
' mr @entity0 added : ' if only @entity18 was up for a one - to - one debate like @entity1 , it would be alright - for some reason @entity18 is running scared			2
' mr @entity1 said : ' i think we should include @entity26			1
' mr @entity0 countered : ' no , one - to - one			0
we just shook on it			0
' speaking on @entity74 's @entity73 , mr @entity0 said he was unsure if mr @entity1 had agreed to the debate or not			2
he said : ' he started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head - to - head debate with me			2
by the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy @entity26			1
' it was clear and then it was unclear			0
i thought @entity1 was going to do what @entity18 has ducked for weeks and weeks			2
' he started the handshake doing it - by the end , constructive ambiguity i think			0
' @entity21 's @entity0 squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power - sharing deal with the @entity91			0

challenged on @entity12 's @entity28 show , mr @entity0 said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country 's deficit are ' completely wrong ' and ' irresponsible '			2

it 's not part of our plans			0
' you know @entity28 , you 've been covering politics for 30 years , parties , large parties at this stage say we 're fighting for a majority and we are			0
' i 'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals			0
' we 're fighting for a majority			0
