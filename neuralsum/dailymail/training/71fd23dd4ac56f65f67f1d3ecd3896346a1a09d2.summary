@entity4 , 37 , had been diagnosed with endometriosis - a gynaecological condition affecting almost two million women in the @entity8 , where womb tissue grows painfully in other areas of the body - but she and her husband @entity12 were told by eight different medical consultants that this should not be affecting her ability to carry a baby to term			1
the couple from @entity19 , @entity20 , appeared on @entity22 's @entity21 with their healthy baby @entity23 to explain that they successfully conceived her just months after @entity4 had pioneering surgery			1
' the challenge was there 's limited research into the link between endometriosis and miscarriage			0
' the frustration was in being told by eight different consultants that everything was normal and to go away and keep trying			1
' @entity12 added : ' the real difficulty is they tell you there is nothing categorically wrong			0
and every time you roll the dice and you get pregnant you hope something will change but you know deep down it wo n't			1
' ' it 's been a real emotional rollercoaster , really quite difficult , but it 's been well worth it ' , said @entity4 ' the frustration was in being told by eight different consultants that everything was normal and to go away and keep trying ' ' it 's been a real emotional rollercoaster , really quite difficult , but it 's been well worth it ' ' every time you roll the dice and you get pregnant you hope something will change but you know deep down it wo n't , ' said @entity12 @entity4 explained that over the years she had had four laproscopies - a laser procedure that involves sticking a tiny telescope into the body to see what 's happening inside and to carry out surgery - each to a depth of 2.5mm			1
each session would involve doctors removing parts of the womb tissue from inside her stomach , which would relieve the pain for about a year but still leave @entity4 miscarrying			1
then the couple met @entity88 consultant @entity87 who told her about a pioneering surgery being trialled in @entity90 that involved cutting back deeper than 2.5mm - all the way to healthy tissue			0
@entity4 and @entity27 with dr @entity93 discussing @entity4 's operation for endometriosis that helped them successfully conceive baby @entity23 the family are picture perfect and could n't be happier with baby @entity23 ' the ramifications for other women are huge , ' said dr @entity93 , who joined the couple on @entity21			1

' as soon as you find out you 're pregnant you 're dreaming of them getting married ! when you 're ready to try again is when you 're ready for that emotional reattachment			0
' a couple who have had three miscarriages are at risk of having more - lots of women have one or two			0
