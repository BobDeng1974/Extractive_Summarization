september was the hottest ever recorded , forecasters have revealed - and they say 2014 is on course be be the hottest year in history			1
the @entity3 announced that last month the globe averaged 60.3 degrees @entity5 ( 15.72 degrees @entity6 )			1
that was the hottest september in 135 years of record keeping			1
@entity9 says april to sept was hottest on record			2
their findings were backed up by the @entity12			0
in this animation the deviation of global temperatures away from the average temperature are revealed , with blue being below average and red above average , for each month			0
the record - breaking heat goes back to the end of last year — november 2013 broke a record			2
so the 12 months from october 2013 to september 2014 are the hottest 12 - month period on record , @entity22 said			1
@entity24 has n't set a monthly record for cold since december 1916 , but all monthly heat record have been set after 1997			1
september also marks the third month in a row that @entity24 's oceans broke monthly heat records , but these are all - time records for how much hotter than normal they were it was the fourth monthly record set this year , along with may , june and august			1
@entity9 , which measures temperatures slightly differently , had already determined that september was record - warm			2
the first nine months of 2014 have a global average temperature of 58.72 degrees ( 14.78 degrees @entity6 ) , tying with 1998 for the warmest first nine months on record , according to @entity3 's @entity12 in @entity35 , @entity36 ' it 's pretty likely ' that 2014 will break the record for hottest year , said @entity3 climate scientist @entity22			1
the reason involves @entity40 , a warming of the tropical @entity42 that affects weather worldwide			0
in 1998 , the year started off super-hot because of an @entity40			0
but then that @entity40 disappeared and temperatures moderated slightly toward the end of the year			0
this year has no @entity40 yet , but forecasts for the rest of the year show a strong chance that one will show up , and that weather will be warmer than normal , @entity22 said			0
if 2014 breaks the record for hottest year , that also should sound familiar : 1995 , 1997 , 1998 , 2005 and 2010 all broke @entity3 records for the hottest years since records started being kept in 1880			1
' this is one of many indicators that climate change has not stopped and that it continues to be one of the most important issues facing humanity , ' said @entity62 climate scientist @entity61			0

some non-scientists who are skeptical of man - made climate change have been claiming that the world has not warmed in 18 years , but ' no one 's told the globe that , ' @entity22 said			2
she said @entity3 records show no pause in warming			0
the record - breaking heat goes back to the end of last year — november 2013 broke a record			2
so the 12 months from october 2013 to september 2014 are the hottest 12 - month period on record , @entity22 said			1

for 2014 april , may , june and august were hotter than they have ever been			0

the @entity93 as a whole was warmer than normal for september , but the month was only the 25th warmest on record			2
beach goers cooling off during the @entity100 heat wave , in @entity101 , @entity102 it sounds like a broken record , but last month again set a new mark for global heat			0
and meteorologists say @entity24 is now on pace to tie the hottest year ever recorded , or more likely break it			2
( @entity108 photo / @entity109 , file ) while parts of the @entity113 , @entity114 and central @entity115 were slightly cool in september , it was especially hotter than normal in the @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , northwestern @entity115 , central @entity119 and parts of @entity121			0
@entity100 and @entity122 set records for the hottest september			1
