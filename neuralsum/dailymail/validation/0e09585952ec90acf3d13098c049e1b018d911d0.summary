@entity0 is the ultimate problem for everyone in men ’s tennis to solve — and for @entity5 in particular			1
the @entity7 no 1 went down 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 in 88 minutes to his direct contemporary on saturday in the latest match of what has begun to look like a one - sided rivalry			1
the 27 year - old @entity14 ’s victory not only put him into the final of the @entity17 at @entity17 , it also represented his ninth victory out of 10 against @entity5 , the exception being the 2013 @entity21 final			2
@entity7 @entity22 @entity5 crashes out of @entity17 semi-final at @entity17 after losing to @entity0 @entity5 plays a shot during his semi-final match against @entity0 in @entity17 @entity26 on saturday @entity0 celebrates his win over @entity5 that sees the @entity14 progress to the final of the @entity17 djokovic and @entity5 meet at the net following their quick semi-final in @entity32 on saturday and @entity5 said : ‘ the frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets			1
@entity0 did n’t give me any free points at the beginning of either set and i made a few too many errors early on			0
‘ at the end of both sets , i started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit , but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him			0
’ @entity0 was in sublime form and @entity5 ’s only chance appeared to be to serve outstandingly well , which he did not			2
on the kind of medium - slow hard court that is so commonplace on the @entity55 the world no 1 , when fully prepared and motivated , looks irresistible			0
@entity0 said : ‘ i tried to start with the right intensity , i got a crucial break at the start			0
@entity5 made a lot of unforced errors , his first - serve percentage was low			0
i ’m sure he knows i ’m returning well , i know he ’s returning well , so that puts added pressure on our serving			0
’ @entity5 's caoch @entity69 watches on from the stands in @entity17 @entity0 will play either @entity72 or @entity73 in the final on sunday there was nothing in the way of the aggravation that marked their last meeting , the @entity82 final , where @entity5 looked like he was getting the upper hand before his opponent started hamming up his physical state and the @entity86 became distracted			1
that was part of what has been , by and large , a decent start to the season for @entity5 , but his problem remains that @entity0 plays in a similar fashion to him and does it decisively better			2
@entity5 had been in impressive form over the past 10 days while @entity0 enjoyed a walkover in his scheduled quarter - final against @entity98			2
and @entity0 will now face @entity72 in sunday 's final after the @entity99 came through his semi-final against @entity102 ’s conqueror , @entity101			1
@entity72 beat the @entity106 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , finally finding the break he needed in the 11th game of the first set			1
he clinched the opener with a forehand winner , then broke @entity101 ’s serve again at the start of the second set			0
@entity101 , enticed to the net repeatedly by @entity72 only to see power strokes whizz past him , struggled against @entity72 ’s serve and the world no 2 completed the victory with a volley at the net			0
@entity5 trudges off the court after his 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 defeat in @entity17 @entity0 broke @entity5 three times to win the opening set and once more in the second to triumph 6 - 2 6 - 3			1
