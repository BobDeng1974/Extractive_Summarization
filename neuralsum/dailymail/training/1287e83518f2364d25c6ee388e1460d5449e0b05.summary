saved survivor : @entity2 's six - organ transplant surgery took 17 hours it was an extraordinary operation – transplanting six organs into a 53 - year - old woman in 17 hours of surgery			1
@entity2 , only the third patient in @entity7 to survive such a procedure , now has a new liver , kidney , pancreas , stomach , small intestine and colon			1
the procedure required four consultants – one to retrieve @entity18 ’s organs and three to perform the implants , which all came from a 20 - year - old female donor			1
there were also two anaesthetists present , two operating department practitioners , two theatre nurses and two other theatre staff			1
without the transplants , @entity18 , an intensive care nurse from @entity27 , @entity28 , who was suffering from a serious liver disease , had been given just six months to live			1
today , as she pats her three spaniels – @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 – after their morning walk with her partner @entity36 , she says : ‘ i ’m obviously meant to be here			1
’ @entity18 ’s problems started when she was diagnosed with @entity43 ’s disease , an inflammatory bowel complaint , at 19			1
a decade later , she underwent an operation to remove part of her colon at @entity48			1
however , her problems continued and @entity18 needed several more operations , which eventually left her with just five per cent of her intestine			1
this meant her only option was to receive all nutrition and fluids intravenously			2
for the next 21 years , @entity18 and @entity36 , who are keen motorsports fans , travelled to various @entity59 events and spent several holidays in the @entity61			2
but in 2011 , she was told that her liquidised food had been damaging her liver and she had end - stage liver disease			1
referred to @entity68 in @entity69 , her only chance of survival was a multi-organ transplant			2
‘ it never crossed my mind that i would n’t get a transplant , ’ confides @entity18			2
two days before christmas 2011 , she was told the organs had become available			2
‘ i did n’t hold any fear about the operation , ’ remembers @entity18			2
‘ in the anaesthetic room i thought , “ this might be the last time i am alive ”			2
but i felt fortunate i was getting this chance			2
’ her consultant , @entity82 , says @entity18 is one of three people in the @entity7 to survive a six - organ transplant in one operation			1
the first survivor was @entity88 , who received a new liver , kidney , stomach , duodenum , pancreas and small bowel in 1994			1
careful timing : the procedure was carried out by four surgeons , two anaesthetists , two operating department practitioners , two theatre nurses and two other theatre staff according to @entity103 , out of 88,052 transplants that have taken place in @entity7 , fewer than 30 have involved three or more organs being transplanted at once			1
‘ the hard part is co-ordinating removing the old organs with the new ones arriving from another part of the country , as this all has to be done swiftly to ensure survival , ’ says mr @entity82			0
‘ in @entity18 ’s case , the organs were implanted as one , with as few joins as possible			0
’ @entity18 spent nine weeks on a ventilator in intensive care , with @entity36 , her mother @entity116 and her brother @entity117 by her side			0
unknown to @entity18 at the time , during her stay in intensive care she needed a further 12 operations to rectify complications , which included bleeding from her new liver and pancreas			1
she also required a 17 - pint blood transfusion			0
when she became aware of her surroundings , she was being fed by tube into her stomach			1
‘ my fingers and toes were so swollen they looked like pigs ’ trotters and my legs and arms were too heavy to lift , ’ she says			0
by march , @entity18 had to learn to walk again because her leg muscles were so weak and she also experienced depression			0
‘ i was n’t well enough to read and i had no other patients to talk to , ’ says @entity18			0
‘ i had n’t expected to feel so ill for so long			0
i lost my hair and nails because all my blood flow was going to my new organs to help them			0
but i got some wigs and make - up			0
‘ with my old digestive system , i could eat anything , but my new one felt uncomfortable when i ate and i felt full for hours			0
i started to wonder if my donor had allergies and if i would crave strange things , but i have n’t			0
’ after more than five months in hospital , @entity18 went home last may			0
she takes 18 tablets a day – immunosuppressant drugs , antibiotics , enzymes and multi-vitamins			0
she is now on a phased return to work			0
she is also setting up a multi-organ transplant support group at @entity68			0
‘ there is n’t a day goes by without me thinking of that person ’s gift to me			1
i sometimes joke that there ’s more of her in me than there is of me			0
