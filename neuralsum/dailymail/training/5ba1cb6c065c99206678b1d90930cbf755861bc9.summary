by @entity1 reporter published : 17:17 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 17:17 est , 24 may 2012 @entity3 beachcombers are likely to stumble across some gruesome discoveries over the next few months , as experts warn that human remains are set to reach the shore			0
dozens of bones are expected to wash up as part of the jetsam from last year 's @entity13 tsunami			1
in total , an estimated 1.5million tons of debris is believed to be on the 3,500 - mile journey from @entity13 to @entity17 and other parts of @entity19			1
cluttered : tsunami debris washed up on @entity21 , @entity17 ahead of a 12 - day clean - up mission oceanographer @entity23 warned this week that the findings would include human remains , which will need to handled sensitively by those who find them			1
' we 're expecting 100 sneakers with bones in them , ' he said on monday at a tsunami symposium in @entity33 , @entity34			1
anyone who discovers such remains should call 911 and wait for police			0
@entity38 may identify people missing since the tsunami hit @entity13 in march 2011			2
' that may be the only remains that a @entity13 family is ever going to have of their people that were lost , ' mr @entity23 said			0
' we 're dealing with things that are of extreme sensitivity			0
emotional content is just enormous			0
' mr @entity23 is the co-creator of the @entity50 computer model , which predicts the movement of ocean flotsam worldwide using known ocean current patterns along with wind speed and direction information provided by the @entity57			2
dumped : a fuel canister and a beer crate among the debris on @entity21 , @entity17 one area which is already the focus of an unprecedented clean - up operation after being swamped by rubbish is @entity21 in @entity17			1
workers plan to spend 12 days clearing the beach there , which is covered in items including balls , buoys , beer crates , styrofoam and lunch boxes			1
@entity21 , which is the largest uninhabited @entity74 island and lies 120 miles southeast of state capital @entity75 , is likely to receive another equally large quantity by the time the year has ended			2
' the debris found on initial surveys of the island showed an absolutely unprecedented amount of buoys , @entity71 and other high floating debris , @entity84 of the @entity85 told @entity86			1
so far the wreckage floating away from @entity88 has included only the odd item - including the bizarre find of a @entity91 and a football that was later reunited with its owner back in @entity13			0
mess : a barrel and @entity71 among the flotsam and jetsam on the island 120 miles from @entity75 washed up : a sign , left , and a buoy and fuel can found by the @entity101 of @entity102 found : a gas bottle that washed up along with other tsunami debris on @entity21 , @entity17 from the air : a view of the island taken from a helicopter but much bigger quantities are set to arrive thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the debris will cross the @entity112 far sooner than previously thought			1
the latest computer models estimate that a vast collection of debris - measuring 4,000 miles across at its longest - will start washing up this october and continue to do so into late 2013			2
a recent satellite image from @entity119 's @entity118 observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean 's surface			0
around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses , factories , cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck @entity13 in march last year			2
while heavy items sank , at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys , oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500 - mile journey to @entity19			1
projections made earlier this year by the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , in @entity141 , @entity142 , suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between march 2013 and march 2014			0
on fast tides : the latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris , shown here in a graphic interpretation of a @entity119 satellite image , from the @entity13 tsunami will hit @entity19 shores far sooner than expected devastation : the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck @entity13 in march last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris , including boats , cars and part of houses and factories into the @entity112 bizarre find : this @entity91 was found on a remote beach on the west coast of @entity163 last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year stunned : the owner of the @entity91 , @entity165 ( left ) , said the discovery by @entity167 ( right ) was a miracle must have been a wild ride : this motorbike was also found by @entity167 on @entity171 , western @entity172 journey : the container holding the items travelled 5,000km from @entity176 in @entity13 where the @entity177 struck all the way to the coasts of @entity163 but predictions from the @entity13 government and the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) has now pushed that date forward to october this year , according to a report in @entity185			1
indeed , many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last november			0
last month , a @entity13 teenager who lost his home in last year 's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote @entity17 beach 3,500 miles from @entity13			1
@entity194 , 16 , came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by @entity19 radar technician @entity196 on @entity198			0
mr @entity196 , who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing , now plans to travel with his wife @entity201 to return the ball			0
can i have my ball back , please ? ! @entity13 teenager @entity194 ( left ) told of his delight after his football was found by @entity196 ( right ) on an @entity17 beach			1
mr @entity196 's wife ( pictured ) also found a volleyball drift : the sports balls were found on @entity198 , about 70 miles from mainland @entity17 and yesterday , the @entity13 owner of a @entity91 motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the @entity3 of @entity163 last week was a miracle			1
the owner , @entity165 , a 29 - year - old resident of the town of @entity219 , in @entity176 , was tracked down by a @entity91 representative in @entity13 who saw the story , first reported by @entity222 , the broadcaster reported today			0
@entity167 , was combing the beach on @entity225 islands when he made the discovery			2
a clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before june or july when two privately - funded expeditions are due to travel into the @entity112			2
poignant : items from the disaster have also been recovered in @entity17 , like this sandal debris : toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the @entity112 @entity34 officials , which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches , say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found			1
@entity34 , @entity246 , @entity163 and @entity17 will get much of it , while most of @entity248 will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea , according to @entity185			1
@entity142 , however , is in line for several deposits			0
the @entity74 navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping			2
but for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them , @entity265 , of the @entity140 , has these words of reassurances			0
' most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet			0
but it is very sparse , very patchy			0

workers to spend 12 days removing debris up beach on @entity17 island
among flotsam and jetsam are buoys , beer crates and @entity71 items
oceanographer says bones of tsunami *victims* are likely to arrive too
