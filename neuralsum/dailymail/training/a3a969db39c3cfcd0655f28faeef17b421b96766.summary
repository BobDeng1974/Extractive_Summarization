' @entity16 , father of @entity17 , revealed his suspicion that @entity8 was ' responsible for the death of my son ' - but he insisted he was not angry at the president			1
he previously made headlines when he slammed @entity24 for acting inappropriately during the repatriation ceremony for his son 's body			2
grief : @entity16 , left , is the father of @entity17 , right , who died in the @entity32 raid on september 11 criticism : mr @entity16 had harsh words for president @entity8 over his response to the attack @entity37 died on september 11 alongside his colleague @entity38 while the pair were protecting a @entity41 building next to the @entity43 consulate in @entity32			1
ambassador @entity44 and diplomat @entity45 were also killed in the raid , which has become a controversial issue in next month 's presidential election due to ongoing confusion over how much the administration knew about the circumstances of the attack			1
speaking to @entity53 on @entity54 on monday , mr @entity16 returned to his criticism of the administration , arguing that the consulate raid was in fact ' an attack on @entity43 soil ' and merited a more forceful military response			1
addressing the president directly , he asked : ' if this attack on @entity43 citizens , on @entity43 soil , happened 2,000 miles away from @entity65 - say in @entity66 or in @entity67 - would you have waited seven hours before you sent the first airplane ? ' would you have waited seven hours until the attack was over ? ' cold : @entity16 also criticised @entity8 and @entity71 for their demeanour when they met him however , mr @entity16 denied that he was motivated by bitterness , saying : ' first of all , i am not angry at all			1
' in fact , mr president , if i had the opportunity of speaking to you face to face , and i would really love to , i would say this : mr president , i respect your office			0
however , if you are responsible for the death of my son , i totally forgive you			1
' this is about honor , courage and about love for @entity43			2
and remember this , mr president : my son and the others died heroes , and it 's better to die the death of a hero than it is to live the life of a coward			1
' if you are responsible for the death of my son , i forgive you , i love you			1
' mr @entity16 last week told @entity99 that he was disappointed by his meeting with senior officials at the event marking the return of the dead men 's bodies			2
he said that @entity24 had acted inappropriately , asking the @entity16 family in a ' loud and boisterous ' tone , ' did your son always have balls the size of cue balls ? ' mr @entity16 asked , ' are these the words of someone who is sorry ? ' violent : @entity37 died during an @entity116 assault on the @entity43 consulate in @entity32 on september 11 the president , by contrast , was apparently much more subdued , to the point of coldness			1
' when he finally came over to where we were , i could tell that he was rather conflicted , a person who was not at peace with himself , ' mr @entity16 said			2
' shaking hands with him , quite frankly , was like shaking hands with a dead fish			0
his face was pointed towards me but he would not look me in the eye , his eyes were over my shoulder			0
' i could tell that he was not sorry			0
' when mr @entity16 met @entity71 , she made a reference to the @entity43 - made @entity138 video mocking the @entity139 which was originally thought to have been behind the attack			1
' when she said that , i could tell that she was not telling me the truth , ' he said			0
aftermath : the events leading up to the raid are still under official investigation six weeks later his recollection of the reception differs sharply from that of @entity37 's mother , who last month took to @entity152 to praise the officials who organised the event			1
writing about the repatriation of her son 's body , @entity155 said : ' the entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal			0
' little did i know that i would find myself in a reception room being comforted , hugged , and , yes , even kissed by the @entity160			0
along with the president , there was vice-president @entity24 , secretary of state @entity71 , secretary of defense @entity163 , and @entity166 and mrs @entity165			0
' they were all wonderful			0
they held my hand , offered condolences , gave warm hugs , and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss , as i fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my @entity3 son			0
' mr @entity16 also denounced the @entity178 for officials ' failure to protect the four @entity43 , saying : ' they denied the pleas for help and they watched my son die			1
' victim : ambassador @entity44 , pictured here with a @entity5 shopkeeper , died in the attack fallen : diplomat @entity45 , left , and seal @entity38 , right , were the other two @entity43 victims in a statement he described @entity37 as ' a true @entity43 hero ' who had ' voluntarily sacrificed his life to protect the lives of other @entity43 '			1
he called for further investigation of the circumstance of the attack , concluding : ' this is an opportunity for the person or persons who made the decision to sacrifice my son 's life to stand up			2
' this is not the first time a parent of one of the victims has publicly spoken out against the president 's handling of the tragedy			0
@entity45 's mother @entity213 has slammed @entity8 for describing the situation as ' not optimal ' , telling @entity215 , ' it 's insensitive to say my son is not very optimal - he is also very dead			0
' she added : ' i am still waiting for the truth to come out and i still want to know the truth			0
i 'm finally starting to get some answers but i wo n't give up			0
' the @entity32 raid has become one of the most divisive issues in the presidential battle between @entity8 and his @entity229 opponent @entity228			2
@entity229 congressmen have accused the @entity178 and the @entity231 of misleading the nation by pinning the attack on the anti-islam video , entitled @entity235 , when there were early signs that it had been a premeditated terrorist operation			0
in addition , government officials have been criticised for scaling back security in @entity32 over the summer , despite @entity44 ' concerns about his safety and that of his team .			2

@entity16 , father of @entity37 , sharply criticises president
' if you are responsible for the death of my son , i forgive you , ' he says
*suggests* administration should have responded quicker to news of september 11 attack on @entity43 consulate in @entity32
