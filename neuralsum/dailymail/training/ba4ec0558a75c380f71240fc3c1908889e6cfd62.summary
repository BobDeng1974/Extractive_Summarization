sometimes it takes a football man to sum up a football problem			0
asked this week about the life of a @entity7 supporter , the club ’s former defender @entity3 delivered what appears to be a reasonable assessment			1
‘ it ’s simple , ’ he said			0
‘ they are bitter , angry and confused			0
’ at @entity13 on saturday afternoon , sentiments will again be clear			1
a protest aimed at dislodging manager @entity15 will involve the distribution of 200 banners and 35,000 cardboard signs before the game with @entity20			1
@entity7 protest group ' @entity21 ' have parodied owner @entity24 's @entity23 logo @entity15 had this pair of official club pictures taken of him during a photocall earlier in the week some supporters have given up on watching their team and decided to not renew cheap season tickets @entity7 owner @entity24 ( centre ) is being encouraged by fans to wield the axe and sack @entity15 @entity24 has come under constant heavy criticism from supporters in the north - east @entity15 himself has indicated he may stay clear of trouble , in the dugout			1
‘ i will just gauge the situation on saturday , ’ he said			0
@entity7 have taken 15 points from the last 72 in the @entity42 and are bottom			1
given this , and the shambolic nature of a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity46 a week ago , @entity15 ’s days in the north - east may be numbered			1
at @entity7 , though , the future of the manager is only a small part of the story			1
no @entity52 city mixes beer and football quite so convivially			0
from the @entity56 to the @entity57 on the other side of the ground , football pub crawls are part of life on match day			0
for some , though , the big bit in the middle of the afternoon has begun to fall by the wayside			0
@entity66 of @entity68 website said recently : ‘ fans tell me they keep going because they meet their mates and do n’t want to miss out on the pub and having a catch - up			1
but some groups go to the pub to watch the match			0
some have just had enough			0
’ disenfranchised by @entity24 ’s controversial and unpopular ownership , saturday afternoon at the match is no longer an essential part of the weekend for some			1
gates at local @entity83 clubs such as @entity84 and @entity85 are up and it ’s no coincidence			0
@entity87 , a presenter on @entity88 , said : ‘ i have given up my season ticket after 30 years and so have others			2
i ’ve got involved at @entity91			0
we have won two games in the @entity93 already			2
that ’s more than @entity7 will manage			1
’ the stats show that attendances remain high at @entity7			1
‘ many @entity7 fans would turn up to watch grass grow , ’ added @entity87			1
however , a visit to the club website reveals that season tickets are available in just about every section of the stadium , while a five - game deal beginning on saturday is on offer for £ 152 per year			1
@entity106 , @entity109 model @entity7 's new third kit before their key clash against @entity20 @entity7 captain @entity109 poses in the new kit , which does n't carry the club 's identity as author @entity118 reveals in his new book on north - east football @entity120 , a visit to one of football ’s great cathedrals is not the intoxicating experience it once was			1
referring to a home game against @entity123 last april , @entity118 recalls : ‘ up on level 7 the atmosphere was like a playground			0
‘ there was a stag party , a hen party , a group of @entity131 lads , a group of @entity134 lads and a lot of children with parents			0
there was lots of eating			0
there were not lots of traditional football supporters and when @entity123 won via a last - minute goal there was no outcry			2
’ @entity7 remains a fervent football city and the club ’s core support remains loyal			1
the edges , though , are becoming frayed and , though @entity15 will bear the brunt , @entity24 ’s critics say it is because of him that the club has become so desperately disconnected from their public			1
with @entity13 festooned with 137 adverts for @entity24 ’s sports direct chain at the last count , the accusation is clear			1
‘ he bought in to football simply to further his sports brand on the back of a famous football club , ’ claimed @entity87			2
‘ the club is a vehicle for his company			2
football is about romance and competing and dreaming			0
for @entity24 it ’s not			1
it ’s just a business			2
’ @entity24 is estimated to have spent £ 250m buying @entity7 and lending the club £ 129m interest - free			1
however , he admitted at a recent @entity172 that his company benefits from its connection with the club and a visit to the stadium shop proves interesting			2
there is plenty of black and white merchandise but there is also a sizeable section where visitors can buy boots , merchandise and kits from all over the world			0
by the door is a machine that dispenses autographed photographs from other @entity42 clubs			0
on its screen on friday a montage included a @entity196 player scoring a goal			0
‘ it ’s not a @entity7 club shop at all , ’ said @entity87			1
‘ it ’s a branch of @entity23			0
’ @entity7 fans hold up a banner with the words ' @entity15 is a muppet ' during the defeat at @entity46 more than 200 banners and 15,000 posters have been printed ahead of this weekend 's match to the outsider , these details seem trivial but it does feel crass and brash			1
it is one of many things supporters would like to talk to @entity24 about , but he does n’t communicate			1
@entity7 regularly ban newspapers that write things they do n’t like while the @entity217 has been excluded from a club - run fans forum after a publishing disagreement last year			1
‘ fans just want to hear him speak , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ that would help and i can understand their frustration			0
’ when @entity7 sold @entity224 to @entity225 in january 1995 , a judge at the city ’s law court adjourned a trial to find out if the bad news really was true			1
today , few @entity7 players would be recognisable outside the club itself			1
chief scout @entity235 ’s faith in what is seen as a value for money @entity239 market has seen an influx of players from across the channel			0
the good ones such as @entity245 and @entity246 have been improved and sold on at profit			0
the others appear to make up numbers			0
it would appear @entity15 does not sign these players			1
he refers to a ‘ transfer team ’ but his role in it does not seem as central as it might			0
in the summer he wanted to sign @entity255 from @entity20 but was alone in his view			0
the last two players to establish themselves from @entity7 ’s youth academy were @entity259 in 2004 and @entity260 two years later			1
this is not necessarily @entity7 ’s fault			1
the number of junior leagues listed in the @entity266 handbook has dwindled from 16 to just two since 1983 - 84			0
nevertheless the lack of local lads in the black and white has served only to further strain @entity7 ’s affinity with its football team			1
the wags say the club ’s academy is now a breeding ground for future @entity276 players			2
a ' @entity278 ' banner in the away end at @entity280 's as supporters lose patience with the football served up meanwhile , fans and former stars accuse @entity24 of encouraging foreign players to use his club as stepping stone			1
‘ now it ’s bitten him on the backside , ’ wrote former midfielder @entity289 in friday ’s @entity290			1
‘ that ’s why we are bottom of the table			0
’ the manager talks diplomatically about these issues but the upshot is that his team is n’t good enough			0
banned from the club , the @entity290 invite their readers to score players out of 10 via their website			2
after last week ’s game midfielder @entity303 came top with 4.1			0
before the game coach @entity305 argued with fans holding a ‘ @entity309 ’ banner and invited them to the training ground to ‘ talk about it ’			2
one man turned up but was sent away by security			0
later in the week @entity305 apologised			0
‘ i know @entity314 , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ he loves the club and i can see why he got angry			2
there is a time and a place for protests			0
they can get to players			0
’ @entity15 has looked haunted at times this season			1
some accuse him of being @entity24 ’s puppet but this week he adopted a more defiant tone			2
he looked ready for a fight and he will need to be			0
@entity24 has already given thought to @entity328 as a replacement and any new manager would find a club in decent financial shape			1
@entity7 turned a £ 9.9m post-tax profit last year and their wage bill of £ 61.7m represents a relatively healthy 64 per cent of turnover			2
@entity24 , though , would have to prove to a new manager that he was willing to invest in the squad with a view to winning trophies			2
from that point of view , the evidence is not great			0
before this summer ’s net spend of around £ 25m , @entity7 were bottom of last year ’s @entity42 teams in terms of player investment over the previous five years			2
the club told their supporters last season that cup runs were not a priority , as research showed them to be of little ‘ benefit ’ in the long - term			1
of all the bleak news to come out of @entity357 in recent times , that was perhaps the most depressing of all			0
on friday they were stacking the shelves with their new third strip			0
it will go on sale in the morning and looks nothing like a @entity7 strip should			2
@entity7 , after all , no longer look , feel nor play much like @entity7 should			2
@entity24 has already given thought to hiring @entity368 @entity7 manager @entity328 as his next boss current assistant manager @entity305 confronted supporters before last week 's mauling at @entity46			1

thousands of cardboard signs aimed at *voicing* *displeasure* at @entity15
club *legends* @entity3 and @entity289 speak out on the @entity377
@entity24 is accused of using @entity7 as a business marketing tool
supporters have given up their season tickets at @entity13
many fans only still go to games in order meet their friends
@entity24 is facing *increasing* calls to sack @entity15 after a poor start
the owner has already thought about hiring @entity328
