rankings of the finest practitioners in sport always carry the heaviest weight at the year ’s end			0
and so , after much deliberation over the turkey and @entity9 pudding , we come to this column ’s listing of the top 10 pound - for - pound boxers in both the world and the @entity14 in 2014			1
world rankings 1 ) @entity16 – still the no 1 man , in the pay - per - view as well as pound - for - pound ratings , despite a non-vintage year compromising two typically proficient , matador - like handlings of @entity21 ’s bull - rushes from the @entity23 pampas 2 ) @entity24 - back to dazzling form in 2014 , first avenging the travesty of last year ’s decision gifted to @entity28 by the @entity30 judges , then seeing off new young champion @entity31 by the basketball score of 120 - 102			1
@entity35 , surely , for the @entity24 and @entity34 man to finally get it on in 2015			2
@entity16 is still , pound - for - pound , the no 1 fighter in the boxing world at the moment @entity24 ( right ) was back to his dazzling best in 2014 , here beating @entity31 3 ) @entity41 – once the most ducked fighter in the world , now demonstrating why as three more stoppages in 2014 give the @entity46 assassin the highest knock - out percentage in the history of the classic middleweight division			1
our own @entity50 never dodges anyone but he had better duck the biggest of @entity55 ’s punches in @entity56 on february 21			0
4 ) @entity57 – credit , please , where credit is due as the @entity62 ’s gentleman ambassador to world boxing moves ever close to the longest reign in heavyweight history			0
5 ) @entity66 – the @entity68 sensation may be small but is perfectly formed and can be ignored in these lists no longer , as this current ring and @entity72 flyweight champion rides an unblemished record of 41 wins including 35 @entity75 up through the divisions towards more world titles @entity57 ( right ) lands a right hand on @entity79 to continue his reign as heavyweight champion @entity82 celebrates beating @entity83 at @entity84 in may 6 ) @entity85 – @entity87 ’s former amateur superstar continues to gain admiration from the purists , if not the blood - lusters , as the 14 all - win world light - featherweight champion with the @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
7 ) @entity95 – still , at 41 , the @entity96 to be reckoned with in the @entity16 - @entity24 firmament , if his wonky knee does not force him into retirement			1
8 ) @entity82 – although @entity101 is knocking on the top 10 door now , the @entity100 remains our only presence in the world ratings by virtue of his devastating ko of @entity83 in that @entity84 spectacular			1
and he ’s up one place			0
9 ) @entity28 – has not seemed the same man since @entity24 took his revenge for that miscarriage of justice – but that is still the only defeat on his record and he clings on at ninth 10 ) @entity117 – the genius amateur from @entity62 rockets into my top 10 after only four pro fights , having won the @entity93 world featherweight title in the third of those , then commandingly defended it against a 52 - 1 former world champion from @entity126 despite breaking a hand in the third round			1
overnight , a star is born			0
* @entity130 , who would otherwise have ranked third here , last defended his @entity92 super-middleweight crown in november 2013 so is excluded due to inactvity throughout 2014			0
@entity14 rankings 1 ) @entity134 – see world rankings 2 ) @entity101 – two huge away wins over @entity137 in 2014 – a three knock - down drubbing of @entity139 and this month ’s dazzling triumph over @entity141 without the loss of a round on my card – have reasserted @entity101 ’s place in this list and alongside @entity16 and @entity24 among the top three welterweights on the planet			1
has also shown great courage in going to @entity151 to help finance rebuilding the school where that ghastly massacre took place – after publicly branding extremist @entity157 violence ‘ a disgrace ’ to his religion			0
@entity101 lays into @entity141 during his excellent victory over the @entity137 in @entity30 3 ) @entity162 – until @entity101 ’s master - outclassing of @entity141 , @entity163 was second in my book courtesy of his own big win in the @entity137 to take the @entity170 world welterweight title from the big - punching @entity171			1
may he enjoy a speedy recovery from being stabbed while on holiday after that gutsy performance			0
4 ) @entity175 – the @entity176 turned huge potential into a world super-bantamweight title with his victory over @entity180			0
the dramatic setting was the @entity182 in the home city where , like his legendary mentor @entity186 , he is building bridges across the religious divide 5 ) @entity188 – delivering , at last , on his olympic gold medal fame and looks to have edged just ahead of his bitter @entity191 foe @entity83 in the super-middleweight line of succession to @entity82			2
@entity162 sticks a right on @entity195 during his seismic victory in @entity197 in august 6 ) @entity83 – has looked a trifle vulnerable in his two fights since being struck down by @entity82 at @entity84 – perhaps having got back in the saddle too quickly after that concussive fall			2
but has the world - class ability to recover , perhaps in a classic rematch with @entity188 7 ) @entity204 – continues to grow into his status as @entity92 ‘ regular ’ world champion and is itching to establish bragging rights over @entity208 in a unification @entity209 , hopefully in 2015			2
8 ) @entity211 – has not fought in his native @entity14 since blitzing @entity212 back in 2009 but his on - going campaign in @entity137 and @entity214 has survived a tough trilogy with @entity93 cruiserweight king @entity216 – one draw , two narrow defeats – and not only brought him the @entity220 belt but also set - up big unification matches in the new year @entity83 ( right ) is on the floor in his second @entity84 fight against @entity82 in may 9 ) @entity50 – still the tough bench - mark for all @entity14 middleweights with only one loss on his record , and that a defeat in @entity229 by @entity23 maestro @entity230 which was as debatable as his other world title setback , a draw versus @entity233 in @entity214			1
will be a huge underdog against @entity55 in @entity56 in february but be sure he will put up one helluva fight 10 ) @entity238 - in this young man ’s case , what goes up may come back down , happily			0
having landed his world title by going up to bantamweight to successfully end the @entity244 fairytale , is considering an attempt at the rare double of dropping down a division to win at super-featherweight * @entity249 , @entity14 - born world middleweight champion thanks to his sensational stoppage of @entity251 in @entity30 , prefers to fight as an @entity252 so does not qualify for this list			2
stand by for not only a @entity254 but a vintage 2015 in the ring .			0

@entity16 was the top pound - for - pound boxer in world in 2014
@entity24 dazzled again , especially in thrashing @entity31
@entity82 breaks into world top 10 and is top of @entity14 rankings
@entity101 had two massive ' away ' wins over @entity137 in the @entity137
@entity188 delivering on @entity268 promise
