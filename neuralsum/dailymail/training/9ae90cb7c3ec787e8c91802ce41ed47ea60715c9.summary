an @entity1 account which shames men who turn hostile when rejected on dating apps has now attracted more than 300,000 followers			1
the @entity1 account is a place where women can expose the bullying and rude reactions provoked simply by telling a man they are not interested			1
as previously reported by @entity12 , the posts - which appear in the form of screen grabs - are not for the faint - hearted and often include extremely vulgar language			2
it seems previous publicity surrounding the account has not made men wary of what they say in messages as a plethora of new posts have been added in recent weeks			1
for example , one man turns ugly after a woman refuses to tell him why she is n't responding to his messages			2
he writes : ' ca n't be cuz ( sic ) i 'm over weight cuz you 're even more fat ... ca n't be cuz i 'm ugly because you 're uglier			0
' when she fails to respond again , he calls her a ' heffer '			0
as this example shows , a theme which often arises in the abusive messages is weight			2
the retorts , like this one where a man starts name calling after his messages are ignored , display a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour in this post a woman is called a ' fat ass ' for not replying to messages another man calls a woman a ' fat pig ' and ' fat and ugly ' after she ignores him			1
many other similar messages on the @entity1 account are unsuitable for publication another rejected man suggests he and the woman would be more compatible ' if you lost 20lb '			1
meanwhile , another calls a girl a ' fat pig ' after ignoring him on the site			0
these are sadly the least offensive of the posts online - most are unsuitable for publication			1
the account was created by @entity87 @entity86 as a means of allowing women to name and shame men who trolled them			1
' i realised these hostile messages were a trend that women see online , ' the operations coordinator told @entity96			2
' all women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites			1
' in this message , a man demands to know why a woman has disliked him on @entity104 this man starts off being complimentary but changes his tune after being rejected @entity86 hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realise that they are not alone			1
and having sifted through a seemingly - endless stream of submissions , she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers			0
' it 's a standard reaction that i 've now seen over and over again with the submissions , ' she added			0
' @entity122 hits on girl , girl does n't respond , guy lashes out with insulting message			0
it really shows the entitlement these guys feel , and i think it shows our cultural misogyny problem			2
' @entity132 , a technology consulting company based in @entity133 , decided to put @entity86 's claims to the test and created an experiment to examine male behaviour on dating sites			1
this texter tells a woman she 's ' two out of ten ' when she chooses not to message him back the company built a @entity104 robot using pictures from a willing volunteer , @entity147 , a ceo of dating network @entity148			2
the robot right - swiped on 1,000 profiles of men in @entity133 and another 1,000 in @entity152			0
over a thousand men messaged @entity147 - but since this was a robot and not actually her , none of the guys received any responses			0
@entity86 set up the @entity1 account @entity160 so women could expose misogyny this sender displays a short temper when his messages are ignored this ' creepy ' man goes from calling a woman his ' love ' to a ' pain in the ass ' in a matter of minutes this sender makes some insulting assumptions when his message is ignored ' we were afraid they ’d become hostile after being ignored , like we ’d seen on @entity160 so many times before , ' says @entity177 , who runs @entity132			1
but out of 1,007 men who messaged @entity147 , none became hostile when they did n't receive a response			0
' just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful			0
sure , there was teasing , guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up , and plenty of bad pickup lines			0
but no one became hostile or resorted to name - calling , ' he says			0
the findings may make women feel more confident about dating this @entity193 given the @entity1 account is enough to put anyone off looking for love online			1
a request of a date quickly turns into name calling in this post this man becomes alarmingly offensive suggesting violence when he 's rejected			0

*bye* @entity1 account shows *unpleasant* side of online dating
the posts expose a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour
account was set up by @entity87 @entity86
she wanted women to have a place to expose misogynist behaviour
hopes it will show women who encounter abuse that they are not alone
