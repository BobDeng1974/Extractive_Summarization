' why not disclose the quadruple , triple lives of certain politicians , of some bosses who do not behave well with women or who sometimes behave in a manner which is very loose ?

there was no specific denial of any of the allegations contained in a new book , @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , but her barrister @entity99 instead said it was a collection of ' author assertions backed by unproven rumours ' , all aimed at ' maliciously tarnishing ' ms @entity15 and her family			2
