if @entity1 count as giants , then surely the entry barrier is too low			1
that is not to skimp on the praise due to @entity5 or indeed the manager with the famous bloodline and delightful habit of embarrassing bigger clubs			1
but the shock of this result needs to be considered against one truth — @entity1 are capable of staggering incompetence and yesterday was an example of a struggling club close to their worst			1
it was their misfortune to run into a side that has now won 14 of 17 cup fixtures under @entity20			1
a side that in the past year has beaten five @entity23 clubs , contested the semi-finals of the @entity25 and will play @entity26 this month in the last four of the @entity27			1
@entity28 fires @entity29 side @entity5 ahead at @entity1 in the @entity25 @entity5 players run to celebrate the opener from @entity28 after 36 minutes in @entity32 @entity33 capitalised on a @entity1 defensive error to score from close range in the second - half @entity37 celebrates after doubling @entity5 's lead at @entity39 on sunday afternoon @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity40 4.5 ; @entity41 5 , @entity42 5.5 , @entity43 5.5 ( @entity44 61 , 6 ) @entity45 6 ; @entity46 5 ( @entity47 46 , 5.5 ) , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 61 , 6 ) , @entity51 5.5 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6			1

one can only wonder how the @entity1 of this tie would do in such fixtures			1
it was all neatly summed up when , at 1 - 0 down to a @entity28 goal , @entity1 goalkeeper @entity40 came to collect a corner but flapped and missed			1
@entity33 watched the farce unfold and stuck out a leg to make it 2 - 0			1
the forward then had the good fortune to be close by when @entity51 ’s dreadful late header to @entity40 landed in his path and 2 - 0 became 3 - 0			2
@entity99 , the @entity1 manager , was furious , even if the cynical view is probably correct — this early exit will probably help in the bigger picture of @entity23 survival			2
but that is a mission that will require a happy squad and results like this , against a club 34 league places beneath them , ought to sting			0
@entity99 said : ‘ i thought they were sharper than us all over the pitch			0
they played well and you have to give them credit — they are a good cup side			2
they obviously raise their game in the cup			0
@entity1 manager @entity99 greets @entity5 boss @entity20 on sunday blades forward @entity60 attempts to take possession off @entity1 left back @entity45 at @entity39 @entity125 international @entity51 strikes towards goal against @entity29 side @entity5 in the @entity25 ‘ but we looked sluggish			1
the last goal summed us up			0
there were no positives , not really			0
i could n’t take any in fact			0
’ the tone was no more positive on the subject of transfers			0
@entity1 have yet to record even a point on the road in the @entity23 and are in desperate need of reinforcements			2
@entity99 is focusing on the loan market and made the concerning admission yesterday that he does not have a clue who will come in			0
@entity1 keeper @entity40 makes a clearance during the @entity25 third round clash with @entity5 @entity48 of @entity1 battles with @entity67 of @entity5 at @entity39 on sunday afternoon @entity1 top scorer @entity146 falls under the challenge of @entity5 's @entity64 @entity1 defender @entity42 and @entity5 's @entity67 battle for the ball at @entity39 he said : ‘ we are only looking for a loan or two			1
that is where we are at			0
who do you find on loan at this time of year ? ‘ it ’s very difficult			0
we are not close to doing any deals at all			0
i have n’t got a clue where we will find any at the moment			0
’ @entity99 made seven changes to the side that drew with @entity162 on @entity163 , but it was @entity51 — one of the four survivors – who had the best chance to set this game on a different path			2
receiving the ball with his back to goal after seven minutes , he hit a hard shot on the turn that forced a good save from @entity123 goalkeeper @entity59			2
that was pretty much as good as it got			0
@entity28 slides on the pitch in celebration having opened the scoring for the away side at @entity39 @entity5 team mates surround @entity28 after he scored to cap off a fine @entity5 move hoops midfielder @entity52 picks out a pass to try and start another @entity1 attack on sunday at @entity39 @entity1 striker @entity47 rises to head at goal but could n't find the back of the net with this attempt @entity5 settled and started to create chances , although @entity1 ’s propensity for self - destruction provided generous help			1
the breakthrough came on 36 minutes			1
@entity66 played a through - ball , defender @entity42 was unsure whether to step out or attack the ball and in the event did neither , meaning @entity28 had a path to goal			1
@entity40 got a touch on the ball but not enough for it to matter			0
the @entity1 goalkeeper was far more culpable for @entity5 ’s second goal , four minutes after the break			1
@entity66 hit a corner to the near post , @entity40 came , missed and watched as the ball clattered off @entity48 and towards his own goal - line			0
@entity28 chests down the ball under the watch of @entity1 defender @entity43 in the @entity25 in form @entity1 forward @entity146 keeps his eye on the ball during against @entity5 in the @entity25 @entity125 @entity51 heads towards goal during the @entity25 third round clash at @entity39 @entity33 adds his second to complete the scoring at @entity39 as @entity5 won with ease when @entity51 made a hash of a header back to his keeper in stoppage time , it was @entity33 who pounced again			1
@entity5 coach @entity226 , speaking in place of @entity20 , said : ‘ i do n’t think people will take us lightly , because of the results we ’ve had			2
in the last calendar year we ’ve beaten five @entity23 clubs			0
‘ we had the great run in the @entity25 last season and we were confident of getting a result but we had to work hard			2
‘ it ’s great that we have good runs in the cup — great for the club , great for the revenue and for the fans — but we know that first and foremost our target is promotion			0
‘ it sends a message to us that we can come and compete with top teams			0
’ a label that served as the only consolation for @entity1 all day			2
the @entity1 players stand at the centre circle in shock after falling to a 3 - 0 defeat at home to @entity5 the @entity5 bench jump up in celebration during the 3 - 0 victory at @entity1 in the @entity25 on sunday @entity33 is all smiles after his double helped @entity5 beat @entity1 3 - 0 on sunday			1

@entity28 put the @entity29 side ahead after 36 minutes
@entity33 scores a second - half brace to ensure the win
@entity5 are already in the @entity27 semi-finals
