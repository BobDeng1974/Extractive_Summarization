by @entity0 president @entity1 has accepted an invitation from @entity4 governor @entity3 yesterday to meet for a ' substantive ' discussion about illegal immigration when the president comes to @entity4 tomorrow			1
the @entity8 had previously requested that the @entity9 governor meet president @entity1 on the tarmac for a handshake upon his arrival in @entity14 , but @entity3 refused and sent a letter to the @entity8 proposing a lengthier meeting			1
' i appreciate the offer to greet you at @entity20 , but a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful discussion regarding the humanitarian and national security crises enveloping the @entity26 in @entity4 , ' @entity3 said			1
@entity8 senior adviser @entity27 sent @entity3 a response letter today telling him ' the president would welcome a meeting with you			2
' ' in addition , he asked me to invite you to join him for a meeting to discuss the situation on the border with faith leaders and local elected officials in @entity40 on wednesday , ' @entity32 said			0
@entity4 gov. @entity3 talks to members of the @entity42 about the humanitarian and national security crises along the @entity45 border on thursday july 3 , 2014 during a field hearing in @entity47 , @entity4 president @entity1 , right , speaks with @entity4 governor @entity3 , left , after arriving on @entity48 at @entity20 in @entity14 , @entity4 on may 9 , 2013			1
@entity3 is refusing to meet @entity1 on the tarmac during his trip to @entity4 this year but the two now have plans to meet up to discuss illegal immigration @entity3 ’s press secretary , @entity53 , told @entity54 on tuesday afternoon that ' gov. @entity3 is pleased that president @entity1 has accepted his invitation to discuss the humanitarian and national security crises along our southern border , and he looks forward to meeting with the president tomorrow			1
' the president 's overture to @entity3 comes after weeks of passive aggressive back and forth in the media between the @entity9 governor and the @entity8			1
@entity3 has repeatedly criticized the administration 's response to the humanitarian crisis at the section of the border near the @entity26 river , telling @entity72 last month , ' the federal government is just absolutely failing			2
' we either have an incredibly inept administration , or they 're in on this somehow or another , ' he said			0
' i mean i hate to be conspiratorial , but i mean how do you move that many people from @entity79 across @entity45 and then into the @entity80 without there being a fairly coordinated effort ? ' @entity1 is traveling to @entity4 tomorrow afternoon to appear at @entity84 fundraisers and meet with @entity80 who have written him letters			1
he is not planning to visit the detention facilities housing illegal immigrant children along the @entity80 border with @entity45 when he visits			1
' if he does n’t come to the border , i think it ’s a real reflection of his lack of concern of what ’s really going on there , ' @entity3 told @entity72 last week after the @entity8 announce @entity1 's intentions not to tour immigration facilities during his trip			1
' if the @entity99 is really serious about securing that border , we can show him how to do that , ' @entity3 said			2
' but i have n’t even had a phone call from this president			0
' the @entity8 has said multiple times that the president does not need to come to the border in person to witness the humanitarian crisis because high - level administration officials are keeping an eye on the situation and giving him regular updates			2
during his daily briefing last wednesday , @entity8 press secretary @entity113 said ' the most important thing ' people like @entity3 could do to fix the broken immigration system ' is not offer public invitations but actually to lend their public support to comprehensive immigration reform			0
' on thursday , @entity113 struck out at @entity3 again , telling reporters that many if not all of the people complaining about the president 's decision not the visit the border would ' rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges			1
' ' if they were committed to solving the problem , you know , for example in the case of the @entity4 governor , he could probably be pretty useful , i hear he 's a pretty persuasive fellow , that he could pick up the phone , and call up some of those @entity9 members of @entity139 from @entity4 who are standing foursquare against common sense immigration reform , ' @entity113 continued			1
' if the governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these problems that exist on the border , the most impactful thing he could do right now , is encourage those @entity9 members of the @entity147 to stop blocking common sense legislation from coming to the floor of the @entity147			2
' the president 's preferred immigration reform legislation passed in the @entity152 last summer , but @entity8 speaker @entity153 has long said he will not allow the bill to come to a vote in the lower chamber because it makes sweeping changes to the immigration system			0
@entity153 and his @entity9 colleagues favor of a series of individual bills that would gradually reform laws pertaining to immigration			0
appearing on @entity164 on sunday morning , @entity3 pointed the finger back at the president , saying his administration sent the @entity8 a letter two years ago about the influx of unaccompanied minors , but the federal government did nothing			2
' this is a failure of diplomacy			0
it is a failure of leadership from the administration in @entity175 said			0
the three - term governor said @entity1 's pleas for @entity79 parents not to send their children to @entity79 are ' about five years too late ' and reaffirmed his position that members of @entity1 's team are ' either are inept or do n't care			2
' ' i have to believe that when you do not respond in any way , that you are either inept , or you have some ulterior motive of which you are functioning from , ' he said			0
@entity3 said he petitioned the president to deploy 1,000 members of the @entity193 to help secure the border in 2010 but @entity1 dismissed his request			1
last week @entity3 again called on the president to send down the @entity193			2
the @entity8 said today that it did not think that more personnel at the border would fix the problem			0
@entity3 also asked for compensation in the amount of $ 500 million to repay @entity4 taxpayers for footing the bill for border security efforts that ought to be funded by the federal government			1
the @entity8 has not yet responded to that request , and it will likely be a topic of discussion during @entity1 and @entity3 's meeting tomorrow			1
@entity4 rep. @entity210 , pictured here in september , expressed concern yesterday that president @entity1 's decision not visit the border will become his ' @entity217 moment ' former president @entity218 said in 2010 that this photo of him looking out the window of @entity48 on august 31 , 2005 , at the devastation caused by @entity217 as he flew over @entity222 , @entity223 , on his way back to @entity225 was a ' huge mistake ' the @entity8 announced weeks ago that it would provide more than $ 250 million in new aid to @entity79 countries to help mitigate factors that would make children flea their home counties for the @entity80 but it took until today to officially ask @entity139 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to confront the immigration crisis head on			1
' with all due respect to the administration , they were one step behind , ' on the immigration crisis , @entity4 rep. @entity210 told @entity240 on sunday			1
' they should have seen this coming a long time ago			0
' ' we should have been ready for this surge , ' @entity210 , a @entity243 , said			0
' the administration should have been ready			0
' in a follow - up interview with @entity72 yesterday , @entity210 said @entity1 may live to regret ignoring calls for him to visit the border during his fundraising swing through the state			1
' i ’m sure that president @entity218 thought the same thing , that he could just look at everything from up in the sky , and then he owned it after a long time , ' @entity210 said			2
in 2005 then - president @entity218 made the mistake of not meeting with @entity223 's governor or other elected officials immediately after @entity217 demolished @entity222 and much of the @entity262			0
to make matters worse , @entity218 was photographed looking down at the catastrophe from the window of @entity48 on his way back to the @entity8 from his home in @entity4 , where he was on a working vacation when the storm hit			0
reflecting on the incident in a 2010 interview with @entity54 , @entity218 said the photo was a ' huge mistake ' and he should have went to see the disaster area first - hand at that time			0
instead , he held a news conference when he returned to @entity225 and designated the hurricane as ' one of worst national disasters in our nation 's history , ' then spent another day in @entity225 before making his way down to the affected area the following day to meet with locals			0
the president and his administration were widely criticized for their lack of preparedness for the crisis beforehand and their slow response afterward			0
@entity210 told @entity72 yesterday that @entity1 was in danger of having succumbing to a similar fate			1
' so i hope this does n’t become the @entity217 moment for president @entity1 , saying that he does n’t need to come to the border , ' @entity210 told @entity72			1
' he should come down			0
' in an appearance on @entity72 this morning radio show host @entity298 speculated @entity1 is more worried about the blowback he would receive if he did tour illegal immigration facilities than if he does n't			1
' i think he ’s worried about being seen in one of these detention facilities … because that could be a photo - op that would blow up in his face , and he ’s worried about what that would look like , i believe , ' @entity298 said			2
' for the president to confront this face to face would be a startling picture			0
he does n’t want that picture out there			0
' the @entity8 denied this afternoon that concerns about a bad photo - op were keeping @entity1 away from the border .			2

@entity3 is upset that @entity1 wo n't visit detention facilities along the @entity80 border with @entity45 when he comes to @entity4 tomorrow
the president invited the @entity9 governor to meet him at the tarmac when he arrives for a handshake , but @entity3 declined
' a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful discussion , ' @entity3 said yesterday in a letter to the president
@entity84 rep. @entity210 of @entity4 said last night that the president may live to regret blowing off calls for him to tour the detention centers
