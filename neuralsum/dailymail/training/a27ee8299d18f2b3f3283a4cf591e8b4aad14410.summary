by @entity0 education secretary @entity1 dismissed claims state schools are ' amoral ' as nonsense a private schools boss has been condemned by @entity1 for claiming state schools are turning out ‘ amoral ’ children			1
the @entity1 reacted with fury after @entity9 , chair of the @entity10 , suggested many state school pupils end up with no sense of right and wrong			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity14 he was speaking ‘ nonsense ’ and said private school heads increasingly fear their sector is threatened by fast - improving state education			1
mr @entity9 claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ‘ moral compass ’ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results			1
too many state school staff operated in ‘ a climate of fear ’ which meant they failed to provide children with an enriching education , he added			1
fee - paying schools devote more time to extra-curricular activities , a broad curriculum and personal , social , health and economic development – meaning their students were able to ‘ distinguish the good from the bad and the true from the false ’			2
mr @entity9 , head of £ 6,867 - a - year @entity36 in @entity37 , which caters for two to 11 - year - olds , made his provocative claims in a keynote speech to fellow heads at his association ’s annual conference in @entity44			2
‘ schools are turning out too many amoral children because teachers can not find the time to teach the difference between right and wrong , ’ he said			1
‘ it seems that the only results that matter are those which have created added value in terms of raising a pupil ’s statistical level from one stage to the next , and parents are increasingly buying in to this notion			0
’ but mr @entity1 insisted : ‘ this is nonsense			0
state schools are getting better in every respect – from delivering a more rigorous education to ensuring children leave school with the right values			1
‘ only a few weeks ago , the head of the independent @entity67 in @entity68 admitted state schools are improving so fast they are increasingly becoming a threat to private schools			1
‘ when i visit a school which gets great academic results it is always the case that everything else about the school is also brilliant ; the sport , the community involvement , the best drama			0
wasting talent , by telling millions of pupils that academic success is not for them , would be truly amoral			2
’ @entity9 claimed state schools are failing to provide pupils with a ¿ moral compass ¿ because teachers are concentrating on delivering better academic results ( file picture ) the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) questioned the values being instilled by private schools – claiming they had turned out many pupils who had gone on to work in the @entity94 and helped cause the financial crash			1
@entity96 , general secretary of the @entity89 , said : ‘ i do n't think there is evidence to support an amoral generation emerging from our schools			2
in many ways , the coming generation has higher standards than our own			0
indeed , one has only to look at sectors with high proportions of publicly - schooled people – like those who led us into the financial crash – to doubt the truth of this proposition			0
‘ values are not just found in the curriculum but in the way you teach the curriculum , in the behaviour policies and code of conduct , in the way adults treat children and each other			2
teachers in state schools would love time for greater breadth and extra- curricular activity , but they are teaching strong values nonetheless			1
’ a @entity131 spokesman said : ‘ all schools should provide a broad education and have a duty to promote the wellbeing of their pupils			0
our reforms will reduce the number of tests that children take and have given teachers the freedom to use their professional judgement to tailor lessons			0
‘ we are also giving all schools more freedom to offer extra-curricular activities that will build character			0
these include sports matches , debating competitions , cadet training and inspirational careers talks from outside visitors			0
we want more schools to take up these freedoms			0
