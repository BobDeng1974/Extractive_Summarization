even after she was released on bail , she remained under suspicion for nearly three weeks until checks revealed @entity22 was responsible			1
another pupil , @entity23 , 15 , was also arrested after police were told she had access to @entity8 ’s email account			1

magistrate @entity38 said the case was being referred to the @entity40 for sentencing , telling the defendant : ‘ what makes this a worse offence than you might imagine is that two young girls were in custody for more than ten hours and were interviewed by police			1
‘ they were also on bail and during that time they must have been under stress			0
you deserve a greater punishment than we can give			0
’ speaking afterwards , @entity8 ’s mother @entity52 , 43 , said : ‘ we are pleased she has admitted it			2
‘ the girls have been through a horrible time at school and hopefully now their classmates will realise the truth			2

@entity8 said outside court : ‘ i was treated like a criminal			0
one officer asked me , “ do you regret what you have done ? ” and i said “ i have n’t done anything "			0
‘ during my interview they told me that if it had been a joke i should just tell them			0
i even thought about admitting it just so i could leave , but i could not do that as i had not done anything			0
‘ it quickly got right round the school that i had been arrested			1
when they found out it was because of a bomb hoax , people were running up to me and saying “ have you got a bomb ? ” ‘ i was even being called “ @entity8 ”			0
it was so upsetting because i have never been in trouble with the police before			0
’ @entity9 with her mum @entity52			2
pupils dubbed miss @entity9 ' @entity156 ' following the incident @entity107 , defending , said his client came up with the ‘ ill - conceived and unsophisticated ’ hoax while suffering postnatal depression after the birth of her second child			1

but they decided to send the case to @entity169 where the maximum sentence she could receive is seven years			0
