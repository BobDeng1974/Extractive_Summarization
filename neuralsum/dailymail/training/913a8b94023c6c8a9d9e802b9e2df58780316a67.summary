by @entity0 published : 14:41 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 14:43 est , 7 november 2012 rating : the days where gaming was none other than a sedentary activity are long over			1
and perhaps no other title embodies this more than @entity6			1
for it is clear from the moment you ’re thrust into the capable hands of one of the game ’s pts , that this is not a game , but a virtual gymnasium			1
upon selecting either a male or female instructor , you are first put through a basic fitness test to evaluate what needs to be improved			2
there are lots of modes , ranging from @entity25 , to five - minute sessions			1
clever : the @entity28 tracks your movements and tells you when your form is starting to fail @entity34 , the game can identify specific weaknesses - for example , if one side is stronger than the other - and then tailor workouts to suit your needs			1
working very much like an exercise class , the instructor first shows you a move , and then you repeat it a specific number of reps			2
@entity34 , an avatar is shown on the screen to ensure that you can check your form			2
exercises wo n’t start until you are in the correct position , too			2
if your form dips , the instructor will tell you or hints will appear on the screen			2
unfortunately , the latter means taking attention away from doing the actual exercise , which only acts as a constant reminder that you are , in fact , just playing a game			0
this can also affect your total @entity62 at the end of each workout , with some likely to find the inevitable and unavoidable loss of points a slight annoyance			0
at the end , workout data is saved and can be tracked on graph , or sent to central @entity71 + servers for a breakdown of @entity62 across platforms			0
visually , although clearly not a game concerned with cutting - edge graphics , it 's nevertheless impressive			1
menus are clear and easy to navigate , and environments varied			0
but the real technological achievement comes through its integration with the @entity28			1
although not perfect , the @entity83 tracking performs well most of the time , showcasing just how far games in this genre have come since @entity87			0
varied : you wo n't just be stuck in a gym			0
the game takes you out in the open sometimes to keep things fresh although it maps out your room , taking into account large furniture , you may find that space is an issue with some of the more dynamic exercises			1
indeed , to get the most from this game you need an open space			0
if motivation is lacking , there is a @entity106 section			0
this allows you to work out with a friend , or challenge other @entity71 + users from around the world			0
in theory , it works brilliantly , but given that @entity113 and @entity114 : @entity115 are released this month , a large amount of users may look elsewhere for multiplayer options			1
overall , a well - balanced , solid game that will get you fitter from the comfort of your living room			1
follow @entity0 on @entity124 : @ @entity125 and on @entity126 : @entity127 .			0

well - presented and clever use of @entity28
lots of different modes and workouts that are tailored to suit your needs
needs a large room to be *effective*
some issues with instruction
