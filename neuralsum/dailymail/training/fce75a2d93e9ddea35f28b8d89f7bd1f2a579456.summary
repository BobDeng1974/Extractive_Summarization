@entity0 was n't known as an aggressive political animal who would take delight in snarling up the traffic for schoolchildren and emergency services to score petty political points			1
she is a mother - of - four after all			1
one who rose quickly up the political ladder in @entity11 with the words ' pleasant ' and ' integrity ' attached to her by those who worked and shared the school run with her			1
but her reputation is today in tatters after @entity20 fired his $ 140,000 - a - year loyal deputy chief of staff for ' lying ' and ' betraying ' him over the ' @entity23 ' plan to close two lanes of traffic on the @entity26			1
and for her friends , those who know her the best , this just does n't fit , she was ' no political pit bull '			2
they are convinced she 's the scapegoat , the fall guy , or at the very least has been set up			0
and a childhood friend of ms @entity0 , who asked to remain anonymous , insisted to @entity49 the 41 - year - old had been burned after going into politics to help others			1
' the noose has been out around her neck to take the fall for this			0
it 's appalling ... they 're saying , " we 've got them ... see we 're punishing somebody and that 's the end of it " , ' the source said			0
they added : ' i think as the dust settles the truth will come out			0
somebody has moved quick to stamp the fire out and hold somebody ultimately responsible			0
' with time the true story will come out			0
i believe this story is much more multifaceted than just @entity0			2
my friend has been scapegoated			2
she does not have a vindictive bone in her body			0
' friends in the @entity75 , @entity11 community , where ms @entity0 lives with her two daughters and two sons , aged 17 , 14 , 10 and seven , came out in support of their neighbor , who is said to have come from a good family of ' high morals and values '			1
she sends her children to catholic schools			0
in 2005 , she wrote a letter to the editor of a local paper about her son , @entity90 , then 5 , who had a heart defect			0
according to @entity92 , she wrote : ' i want parents to have hope for children with heart disease ... it is not automatically a death sentence , and although it is extremely difficult to maintain a positive attitude during such tribulation , it is imperative for the children that parents remain hopeful and optimistic that we have access to the best medical care in the country			0
' friends said @entity0 , pictured here with @entity20 in september last year , was ' excited but not starry - eyed ' about working for the governor @entity0 with @entity20 and community affairs commissioner @entity115 , center left , at @entity116 in september 2013 one friend , who asked to remain anonymous , told @entity118 : ' @entity0 is wonderful			1
she 's a great mother , a wonderful friend			2
' and on a @entity120 forum supporters closed ranks around @entity0 , with one woman , @entity122 , saying : ' @entity0 is a woman of honor , decorum and integrity			1
i am appalled that she is being made a scapegoat of all this			0
' fired : @entity0 has lost her job as @entity20 's deputy chief of staff outside of her political career , ms @entity0 was involved in her community , where she served on the parent boards of her children 's schools			1
her now deleted @entity136 account further revealed a dedicated mother who took pleasure in her children 's accomplishments and enjoyed family events such as @entity143 fun runs			2
although recently separated from her husband , professional golfer @entity145 , the couple still lived close together			1
her father @entity146 , a director of veteran services in the county , refused to comment on his daughter 's situation , but those close to the family said they had strong values			0
and what has shocked friends is the claim that she would endanger public safety by snarling up the traffic on the @entity26 and delaying emergency vehicles - particularly as her brother is an emt			2
ms @entity0 had risen quickly through the ranks since graduating from @entity162 with a political science degree in 1994			1
despite her quick climb , co-workers denied she was ' the political pit bull type ' , further casting doubt on her having a leading role in the bridge scandal			2
' i do n’t know who the person is that gave the ultimate order , ' mr @entity46 said , adding that he did not believe ms @entity0 would suddenly have decided to set off the chain of events herself			1
however , a @entity178 official in @entity179 who did not want to be named , told @entity180 : ' if someone talked to her funny or did n't give her the right amount of respect , she 'd make a phone call and put the kibosh on it ' , referring to how she would block volunteers jostling for political jobs moving up			0
former co-workers described @entity0 as ambitious but not the ' political pit bull ' type @entity0 , who quickly rose through the ranks to become deputy chief of staff , is pictured in september last year @entity0 , pictured with her brother @entity194 , and a family friend outside of work @entity0 was focused on her family and served on school boards he added : ' it 's the banter she would usually have used			1
it 's something that she would have said			0
i 'm just surprised she 'd be stupid enough to write it down			0
' ms @entity0 had joined @entity20 's staff in 2010 , but her career started as a legislative aide - and later chief of staff - for assemblyman @entity208			1
over the next few years she moved up the ranks , and was promoted to her well - paid role as deputy chief of staff in april last year			1
but a close friend said despite being thrilled by the high - flying role she remained down - to - earth			1
' who would n't be excited about working for the governor			0
but for her it was an opportunity to give back			0
she was n't starry eyed about working for the governor			0
she was excited about having a position that she could be a voice of the people			0
' the source said that the bridge scandal was the ugly side of politics ' and added : ' it does not become her whatsoever and it 's not who she is			0
' the promotion moved ms @entity0 into @entity20 's inner circle , putting her in close contact with officials and lawmakers , including @entity44 mayor @entity234 , who was the subject of several of the emails			1
@entity0 's father , @entity146 , has refused to comment about the scandal the @entity240 home in @entity75 , @entity11 , where fellow residents have described @entity0 as a woman of integrity friends and supporters of @entity0 describe her as a ' woman of honor ' her role brought her so close to @entity20 that she even tweeted a picture of him at her 40th birthday dinner last year			1
in a message tweeted to @ @entity253 and several others in september 2012 she said : ' thank you for a great night ... and it 's rare that i 'm at a loss for words '			0
as questions swirl in @entity261 about the two @entity20 aides who got the axe on wednesday , @entity49 learned that they were connected by more than just the jobs they lost			2
ms @entity0 , @entity20 's now - former deputy chief of staff , was apprenticed to political insider @entity266 when they both worked on his 2012 re-election campaign , and she took orders directly from him , according to a long - time @entity11 political operative who spoke to @entity49 in @entity271 the insider , who requested anonymity , told @entity49 that ms @entity0 was the tie between @entity20 's administration and the state 's @entity178 political machine			1
mr @entity266 's job , the source said , ' was to keep the governor 's fingerprints off of things , ' and ms @entity0 's ' was to put plans into action '			1
the ' plans ' that came to light this week were part of a dirty - tricks campaign meant to use a traffic jam to settle an unspecified political score			0
he would n’t speculate on how much governor @entity20 knew about the bridge - traffic plan while it was in motion			1
but speaking of ms @entity0 , he claimed that ' if she pulled the trigger on all of this , it was on @entity46 's urging			2
' mr @entity266 did not respond to attempts to contact him about his level of knowledge of the plan , which came to light on wednesday when @entity304 legislators released 22 pages of electronic messages showing ms @entity0 and others orchestrating the operation .			2
