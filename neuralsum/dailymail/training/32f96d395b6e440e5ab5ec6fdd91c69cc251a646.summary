by @entity1 reporter published : 07:21 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 19:54 est , 2 april 2012 a woman has told how she was unrecognisable after an apparent reaction to her mobile phone cover left her face covered in a horrific rash			1
@entity7 noticed her face swelling up after fitting a soft silicone @entity10 cover to her @entity11			1
the 30 - year - old marketing manager developed the rash across her face and neck – with a ‘ phone - shaped ’ sore where she had held the handset to her ear			1
@entity7 , 30 , from @entity19 , suffered an horrific allergic reaction to an @entity11 cover marketing manager @entity22 was covered in a sticky yellow ' phone - shaped ' rash where she had held the handset up to her ear miss @entity7 went to hospital when her own mother failed to recognise her , but was sent home with over-the - counter antihistamine tablets			1
the next morning , however , her face had swelled so much she was unable to open her right eye and could barely swallow			1
she returned to hospital where tests revealed she had developed 13 skin allergies			1
miss @entity7 , from @entity33 , @entity19 , has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans , coins and door handles			1
she said : ' my neck looked like a roll of sausages and i knew i definitely needed to go back to the doctors			0
' you could literally see the shape of where the phone had been on my face , lots of little spots came up in the same area			2
' you could see a distinctive mobile phone shape , there was no question of what it was			0
' my mum did n’t recognise me at first , she gasped in shock when she saw me , she was appalled			0
she thought i ’d stay like that forever			0
the reaction also caused mr @entity62 's face to swell up just one week after using her @entity11 with a trendy new silicone case issued by @entity64 the rash which covered miss @entity7 's face and neck swelled up and she said made her virtually unrecognisable ' when i saw a new doctor they examined my throat and they got concerned when they could n’t see down there			1
' i could n’t swallow properly , so the doctors booked me in to another hospital and told me to go there straight away			2
' coins , belt buckles , and even mobile phones may also cause an unpleasant allergic reaction when they rub against the skin			2
the reason is that they all contain nickel , the most common cause of skin contact allergies in the industrialised world			1
many millions of people know they have to avoid anything made with the metal - and now scientists understand why			0
they have shown that nickel binds to a particular immune - system protein normally involved in detecting harmful invaders			0
in susceptible people , this results in the body recognising nickel as an infectious agent and triggering inflammation			0
as the immune system goes into overdrive , it produces the classic symptoms of burning , itching , redness , swelling and blisters			2
after suffering the reaction in november miss @entity7 was referred to the dermatology clinic at @entity108 , where she underwent 140 patch tests on her skin			1
the tests , which normally identify a handful of allergies , showed up an incredible 13 on miss @entity7 's skin			1
doctors suggested her allergies could have been triggered by the silicone in her @entity11 case			1
miss @entity7 , who lives with partner @entity119 , 32 , said : ' the doctors said that just because i had n’t had a reaction up to that point , it did n’t mean that i would n’t have one in the future			1
' the doctors gave me advice like wearing gloves when i handle money , but i do n’t do that as i ’ve never had an issue with it before			0
' but i ’m super-careful and i do anything i can to avoid setting off my allergies			2
' i 'm going on a spa date with my boyfriend ’s sister soon and stuff like that makes me really uncomfortable because you do n’t know what goes on your body when you go to places like that			0
' it ’s really hard to get involved unless i take a few risks when i probably should n’t			0
' since the incident with the phone case i 've become a lot more sensitive to the sun - i used to tan really well but now i have to be really careful			0
' and then i have to be really careful in terms of what chemicals are used in suntan lotions because i could have a reaction to that as well			0
miss @entity7 , from @entity33 , @entity19 , has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans , coins and door handles ' the last bad reaction i had was at @entity162 last year when i had a reaction to some kind of make - up			2
' i borrowed some off my mum , and it made my eye swell up so that i could n’t see out of it			2
' it was probably a stupid thing to do but i sometimes completely forget what i ’m meant to be doing and what i ’m not supposed to do			0
' it also caused @entity7 to come out in a rash if she came into contact with nickel and she is now allergic to coins , door handles and some make - up			1
miss @entity7 bought the £ 16 cover through the @entity182			2
she said : ' i 've contacted both @entity64 and @entity183 to warn them about my allergic reaction but i have n’t received any calls back or any letters			0
' i just do n’t want this to happen to anyone else because it 's put my life on hold			0

@entity7 , 30 , noticed her face swelling up after fitting new case
an horrific rash then began to spread across her which started to swell
the *day* after she could barely swallow and could *n't* open one eye
tests revealed she had developed 13 different skin allergies
