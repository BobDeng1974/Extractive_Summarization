by @entity0 published : 01:51 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 23 august 2013 the plans reveal the extent of the enormous development that @entity4 wants beneath his mansion this is the vast two - storey basement that is costing a wealthy hedge fund manager £ 825,000 in council fees – on top of £ 4million to build it			1
the plans reveal the extent of the enormous development – equivalent to the size of 20 two - bedroom flats – that @entity4 wants beneath his mansion			1
he intends to install a swimming pool , spa , wine store , cinema and games room under the existing building and gardens			1
an ‘ appropriately designed ’ first floor extension is also proposed			2
the entire 1,130 square metre project is expected to take two years to complete at an estimated cost of £ 4million to mr @entity4 , 48 , and his 42 - year - old wife @entity26			1
but the vast scale of the work , on two four - storey villas in @entity31 ’s @entity30 , means it has fallen foul of rules that normally apply only to commercial developments			2
in order to win planning permission mr @entity4 , a former @entity36 who has an estimated fortune of £ 55million , has agreed to pay @entity39 and @entity40 £ 825,000 towards social housing in his community			1
under @entity45 of the @entity46 developers are required to make a contribution on any project bigger than 800 square metres			2
a typical new home in @entity31 is around 102 square metres			2
the payment is in addition to a £ 20,625 ‘ monitoring fee ’ , a £ 42,500 community infrastructure levy to the @entity54 and a £ 337 planning application fee			2

a spokesman for mr @entity4 ’s company @entity64 , which has offices in @entity66 and @entity67 , said he was not available to comment			1
however a friend of mr @entity4 said he was ‘ surprised ’ by the fee			1
the entire 1,130 square metre project is expected to take two years to complete at an estimated cost of £ 4million the development is the latest in a growing trend for ‘ iceberg ’ homes where projects dig down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions			1
planning applications for basement extensions in @entity39 and @entity40 have soared from 13 in 2001 to 307 last year			1
the huge excavation necessary for the project is likely to cause major disruption to neighbouring properties with scores of lorries removing earth from the site			0
one neighbour said : ‘ it will certainly be one of the “ iceberg houses ” and sadly , our house will probably be the @entity95			0
’ @entity39 and @entity40 yesterday said the £ 825,000 figure had been suggested by the developer and was later agreed by planning officials			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it is very unusual for a section 106 agreement to apply to a domestic development but this is a very large project			1
’ property experts suggested the couple may be keen to start the project before new rules are introduced reducing the size of subterranean developments			0
the vast scale of the work , on two four - storey villas in @entity31 's @entity30 , means it has fallen foul of rules that normally apply only to commercial developments @entity115 , partner at developers @entity116 , said : ‘ i ’m shocked at the size of the extension and the size of the fee they ’re suggesting			0
it ’s well out of the range of normal extensions			0
they ’re obviously trying to get this in before the big change in october			0
‘ @entity39 and @entity40 are reducing the amount of area that you can create under a garden			0
we ’ll likely be seeing a rush of others doing this before the deadline			0
’ the development is expected to add around £ 10million to the value of the combined property , which already has a total of 13 bedrooms			1
once finished the property will be worth an estimated £ 50million , making it one of the most expensive in one of the most fashionable areas in @entity31			0
the project was applied for in the name of mrs @entity148 , who owns one of the properties			0
her husband owns the neighbouring house through a company .			0
