by @entity0 last updated at 2:22 pm on 26th january 2012 @entity2 's fond recollections of working under @entity3 in the 1980s have been rubbished by a @entity5 colleague who claims he was often extremely critical of the former president			2
in several of his campaign speeches , @entity7 has alluded to his work with the 40th @entity11 president , claiming ' we helped defeat the @entity14 empire ' and ' i helped @entity3 create millions of jobs ' among other achievements			1
but @entity18 , a former assistant secretary of state , said that rather than working side by side with @entity3 , @entity7 was scathing about his plans to defeat @entity22 and often refused to support his decisions			0
not eye to eye : @entity2 repeatedly insulted and disagreed with president @entity3 , especially over his policy towards @entity26 , and insider has revealed claims : former assistant secretary of state @entity18 said @entity7 was often critical of @entity3 's presidency and policies mr @entity18 said that when @entity7 was first elected to @entity32 in 1978 , the freshman members chose to attack @entity3 as often as he voted for him			2
writing in the @entity33 , he describes a statement made by @entity7 on march 21 , 1986 , at the height of the @entity37 contras funding debate			0
he quotes @entity7 : ' measured against the scale and momentum of the @entity14 empire 's challenge , the @entity3 administration has failed , is failing , and without a dramatic change in strategy will continue to fail ... president @entity3 is clearly failing			1
' the burden of this failure frankly must be placed first on @entity3			0
' in another bitter attack , he compared @entity3 's meeting with @entity14 leader @entity50 as ' the most dangerous summit for the @entity52 since @entity53 met with @entity54 in 1938 in @entity55 '			1
he also criticised @entity3 's delivery in speeches and claimed his policies towards the @entity14 were ' pathetic ' and ' incompetent '			2
ultimately , @entity3 's stance on the @entity14 empire proved correct as the @entity14 collapsed in 1991			2
@entity7 reacted similarly to @entity61 when he was making a decision on the surge in @entity64 and facing opposition from top generals and other republicans in 2008			1
critical : @entity7 , 69 , pictured with his wife @entity69 , has used recollections of his time working under @entity3 during his speeches main rival ? @entity75 hopeful @entity74 at @entity76			1
the pair are neck - and - neck in polls in @entity80 ahead of the fourth primary on tuesday it comes after it emerged @entity7 and rival @entity74 are neck and neck in the fight for @entity80			1
public opinion polls have now put the two @entity75 in a close contest and the winner of tuesday 's primary will be the first to claim a second victory in the race for the nomination			0
the first three nominating contests , in @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , have gone to three different candidates			0
@entity7 , a former @entity5 speaker , has tried to paint @entity74 as out - of - touch by highlighting bank accounts in @entity99 and the @entity100			1
flashback : @entity3 is pictured with @entity50 in 1987 as they sign the start treaty			0
@entity7 compared their first meeting to that of @entity53 and @entity54 in 1938 trailing : @entity107 and , right , @entity108 , have very little presence in @entity80 and neither is expected to gain much support in the next primary the 69 - year - old himself has faced criticism over his remarks on president @entity116 's infidelity in the mid- 1990s , at the same time as he was involved in an affair			1
@entity107 , who won the first primary in @entity94 , stands virtually no chance of winning the @entity80 caucus and has not planned any advertising in the state as he focuses on the @entity123			0
@entity108 , who has yet to win a primary , has also been virtually absent from the sunshine state expect for appearances at the two debates .			0

former @entity5 speaker has used *connections* with *popular* president to go neck - and - neck with @entity74 in polls
*embarrassment* after 69 - year - old used defeat of @entity14 empire as *personal* achievement , despite opposing @entity3 policies
described @entity3 meeting with @entity50 as ' most dangerous since @entity53 met @entity54 in 1938 '
@entity7 also criticised @entity61 on surge in @entity64 in 2008
polls in @entity80 put him level with @entity74 in race for @entity75 nomination
