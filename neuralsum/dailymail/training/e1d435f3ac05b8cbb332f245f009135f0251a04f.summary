the 25 - year - old 's pretty summer outfit featured a printed knee - length skirt , on - trend aviators and a coffee - coloured top showing off two very obvious nipple outlines			1
and now fashion tome @entity15 is claiming that nipples could be one of the hot new style tricks of the spring season			1
@entity1 sported the braless look last week in @entity8 prompting the fashion press to declare that nipples are back in style the lingerie model is the latest star to brave the look now that spring has arrived as an underwear model @entity1 is used to her chest being the centre of attention and her lingerie line for @entity33 is currently the store 's best - selling range			1
but it was her brave braless wardrobe choice that grabbed the attention of the fashion magazine , who claim that the saucy style option is a result of spring catwalk trends			2
@entity44 billed @entity1 's look as a ' trend alert ' today and said ' we reckon the wave of celebrities out and about ( literally ) could be down to the catwalk clothes of this season			1
' some of spring / summer ’s most significant trends call for styling sans brassiere and flashing a risqué amount of flesh			0
even @entity58 ’s extremely ladylike finale looks – which consisted of crew - neck black tees and ankle - sweeping full skirts - were a little bit cheeky because the fine gauge tops revealed a subtle hint of nip			0
' those ultra-deep v necklines on the runways of @entity66 and @entity67 are gathering apace , too			0
and that 's before we even consider the crop tops , spaghetti straps , sporty sheer layers and all manner of strapless frocks around			0
' @entity77 's perky @entity76 dress at the 2013 @entity78 inspired the @ @entity80 twitter handle @entity1 is n't the only star to whip off her bra			1
fellow clothes horse @entity83 is a huge fan of letting it all hang out when she is dressed down on her days away from the studio			0
and at the @entity78 in february @entity77 's perky @entity76 gown inspired a @entity89 account dedicated to the actress 's chest			1

since then stylish stars @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have all followed suit , letting their nipples slip in to view as a conscious part of their red carpet looks			0
model @entity83 is a big fan of dressing down and letting it all hang out when off duty and actress @entity110 favours a sheer top on sunny days subtle and very sexy : @entity101 at the @entity113 and according to the latest research these boho babes will be having the last laugh , as @entity118 scientists claim that wearing a bra can actually make breasts more saggy			1
a 15 year study of @entity118 women came to the conclusion that wearing a bra does not prevent sagging or ease back pain as commonly thought			2
professor @entity127 , from the @entity128 whocarried out the study said : ' @entity130 , physiologically , anatomically - breasts gain no benefit from being denied gravity			0
' bra experts @entity133 , probably not surprisingly , remain unconvinced , claiming : ' your breasts are composed mainly of fat and tissue and over time they lose elasticity , wearing a bra every day can help prevent stretch marks and sagging			2
@entity143 , @entity144 at @entity33 says ' the shape of the nation is changing			2
women are getting bigger and the average lingerie size has gone from a @entity149 to a @entity150 in the last decade so it ’s become more important than ever to wear a bra for both comfort and support			0
