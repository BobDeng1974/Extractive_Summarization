conspiracy theorists have accused @entity1 of cutting its live feed from the @entity3 whenever a ' @entity4 ' appears			1
on two separate occasions this month , alien hunters claim to have spotted mysterious objects appearing on their screens before it goes blank			1
@entity4 watcher @entity10 recently spotted a @entity4 outside the space station , moments before the stream was interrupted for 10 to 15 seconds			1
one possible is that it was a bit of debris that hit the lens , or even the moon mr @entity10 told @entity23 that there are ' always some ufos showing up , ' and ' @entity1 always cuts the feed when a @entity4 gets close to the station			1
' the alien hunter claims to have captured a still photo of the unidentified object from the feed - and it looks remarkably like the @entity32 insignia in @entity33			1
he also says that @entity1 has removed the recording from its archives as part of efforts to conceal alleged communication between astronauts and @entity4 in a separate incident last week , a grey object was seen coming up over the horizon and then disappearing moments before @entity1 switched to a different camera			1
@entity4 watcher @entity10 recently spotted a @entity4 outside the space station , before the stream was interrupted for 10 to 15 seconds			1
the alien hunter claims to have captured a still photo of an unidentified object ( pictured ) that appeared on the live feed on january 6			1
it look remarkably like the @entity32 insignia in @entity33 one possible is that it was a bit of debris that hit the lens , or even the moon			1
but ' @entity60 ' , the @entity57 who posted the video is n't convinced			0
' please bear in mind that the moon appears white when it shows , ' he writes			0
meanwhile on october 7 , @entity4 watchers said they witnessed a strange object near the station during a spacewalk by astronauts @entity68 and @entity69			1
the object was later identified as being either a speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun. that did n't stopped some conspiracy theories arising though , with ufologists somewhat speculatively claiming it was proof that we are not alone in the universe			2
one of the most interesting cases in the files is the @entity84 incident was reported august 30 , 1951 in @entity85 in 1948 , the @entity87 government launched several inquiries into @entity4 sightings , which many believed were sparked by @entity91 paranoia			2
in what became known as ' @entity93 , ' more than 12,000 encounters with @entity4 were looked into by the @entity95			2
now , decades after the files were closed , the microfilms have been made available online for free – allowing anyone to re-examine the evidence			0
the @entity95 says that the @entity93 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files			0
the files , which can be accessed here , were previously only available by visiting the @entity105 in @entity106			0
professor @entity107 from the @entity109 @entity108 tells @entity110 : ' generally speaking @entity4 sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence			2
' it 's difficult to judge from the video in this instance , because of its poor quality			0
if @entity1 has access to high quality images , they may investigate further			0
' @entity1 is yet to comment the incidents			0
the space agency 's @entity3 live stream and rover photos have become a huge source of ' evidence ' for conspiracy theorists			1
many scientists believe @entity4 sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia			0
this describes the brain 's response to seeing significant objects in random places			0
' the vast majority of these images are as vague and elusive as those posted by @entity4 witnesses on @entity145 , and many have a fairly mundane explanation , ' @entity149 author of the @entity4 investigations @entity151 told @entity110			0
' the problem is that the more @entity1 denies such things or explains them the more people think there is a conspiracy to hide the truth that aliens are visiting our planet			0
' on october 7 , @entity4 watchers said they witnessed a strange object near the station during a spacewalk by astronauts @entity68 and @entity69			2

alien hunter , @entity10 , recently spotted a ' @entity4 ' outside the @entity3
but the live stream was interrupted for 15 seconds after it appeared
in a separate incident , a grey object was seen coming over the horizon
one *possibility* is that it was the moon , or debris left on the lens
