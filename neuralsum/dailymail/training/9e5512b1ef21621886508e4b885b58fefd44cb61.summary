a bull which was destined for the slaughterhouse after a vet said he is gay but was granted a last minute reprieve following an intervention from a @entity6 creator has arrived at his new home			1
@entity9 the gay bull has today arrived at his new home at @entity10 , @entity11 , where he will undergo the snip before living out the rest of his days in peace thanks to terminally ill @entity6 co-creator @entity16			1
and within seconds of his arrival @entity9 experienced his first kiss - from @entity19 the one year old bullock living in the next door pen on the farm			1
but before the bull can completely relax he will have to undergo castration to calm him down and stop him terrorising the other animals			0
@entity39 , who works at the sanctuary , told @entity41 : ‘ we will castrate @entity9 , because once you castrate them you do n’t tend to notice their sexual preferences so much – it settles them down			2
' he added : ‘ we ’ve got three really gentle elderly cows that are going to be next to him in the barn			0
’ @entity9 had been destined for the butchers after he failed to show any interest in the female cows on his farm in @entity56 and instead seemed to gravitate towards the other bulls			0
the bull was saved by fundraisers including @entity6 co-creator @entity16 ( pictured ) a vet told his owner that it was @entity9 's sexual orientation that was the reason he would n't and could n't breed			1
but @entity62 producer and long - term vegan mr @entity16 heard about his plight and bought the animal 's freedom by donating £ 5,000 to buy and transport @entity9 to a sanctuary in time for @entity69			1
mr @entity16 , who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 , recently said that he would give away his entire $ 100million fortune on animal rights causes			0
mr @entity16 said : ' @entity73 told me about @entity9 , and i felt compelled to help			1
all animals have a dire destiny in the meat trade , but to kill this bull because he 's gay would 've been a double tragedy			0
' it thrills me to help @entity73 and @entity82 make @entity9 's fate a sanctuary rather than a sandwich			2
' mr @entity16 was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and has chosen to use his money and the time he has left to help animals in need			0
this includes getting 17 bears transferred from virtually barren concrete pits to a lush new home , helping retire a lame horse used for racing and securing the transfer of a chimpanzee who had spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement at a zoo to a reputable sanctuary			0
he also runs the @entity102 , an organisation dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs			0
given three months to live in 2012 , mr @entity16 immediately decided to team up with @entity73 ( @entity73 ) president @entity104 , and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation			2
@entity9 is currently blissfully unaware that before he settles in at the sanctuary , he must undergo castration @entity9 meets his new neighbours - three gentle elderly cows that are going to be next to him in the barn having defied that diagnosis ’ original death sentence , @entity16 continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as ' @entity117 ' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities			1
in addition to the money fronted by @entity16 , more than 250 other individuals have donated to fund the bull 's transfer via a crowd - funding initiative set up by @entity126 animal - protection group @entity82 and @entity127			2
a coy - looking @entity19 post-kiss with @entity9 - he is a one - year old bullock living in the next door pen on the farm			1

@entity9 was destined for the slaughterhouse after he *refused* to breed
fundraisers including the @entity6 's co-creator @entity16 intervened
will now live out rest of his life at a @entity11 sanctuary - after the snip
upon arrival was immediately given a welcome kiss from @entity19
