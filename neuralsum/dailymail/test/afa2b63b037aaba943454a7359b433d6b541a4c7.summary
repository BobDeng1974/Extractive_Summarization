traitor @entity0 has revealed he did not read all the top - secret intelligence documents he leaked – a move which put lives at risk from terrorists			1
in a television interview the fugitive squirmed as he admitted only ‘ evaluating ’ the files stolen from @entity10 and the @entity11			1
the former @entity13 spy also acknowledged there had been a ‘ f * * * - up ’ when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against @entity19			1
the 31 - year - old stunned the world in june 2013 – less than a month after the murder of @entity35 by @entity37 extremists – when he broke cover as the civilian @entity40 worker who stole classified documents			1
he leaked information about attempts by spying agencies including @entity10 and the @entity11 to view citizens ’ private information , claiming internet history , emails , text messages , calls and passwords were harvested			2
but security chiefs have warned that secret techniques , revealed by @entity0 ’s leaks to the @entity56 newspaper , have made it easier for terrorists and organised criminals to avoid detection			1
last month , home secretary @entity61 attacked the harm done by the traitor – now one of the world ’s most wanted men			2
terror experts said lives were being lost because he had hampered security service operations			2
they warned that extremists had altered their tactics after he leaked details from intelligence agencies – with fatal results			2
in sunday night ’s interview with @entity78 tv host @entity22 , for @entity13 channel @entity79 , @entity0 pointedly avoided saying he had read every document he handed over to journalists			1
at one point the @entity78 comedian asks @entity0 whether he had read all of the documents he sent to journalists			1
the whistleblower said he had an ' understanding ' of their content he would only say : ‘ i ’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive			2
’ pressed , he added : ‘ i do understand what i turned over			0
’ but he acknowledged ‘ recognising the concern ’ over whether he knew enough about the contents of the files or the abilities of reporters to protect classified details			0
@entity0 admitted there had been a ‘ f * * * - up ’ with the way in which some of the information about the @entity11 and @entity10 , @entity78 ’s intelligence agency , had been released			1
last year , the @entity103 published a slide containing the name of the @entity11 employee who prepared it			0
the target of the surveillance was also identified as @entity19 in @entity110 , @entity111			0
@entity0 said such details should have been removed and , in a feeble attempt to defend his actions , added : ‘ in journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made			1
this is a fundamental concept of liberty			0
’ unconvinced , mr @entity22 replied : ‘ you ’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there … we ’re not even talking about bad faith , we ’re talking about incompetence			0
’ @entity22 tries to get @entity0 to explain the leak in the context of nude pictures			1
the ex-cia systems administrator claims the government can see most of the pictures you share it is one of the few occasions in which @entity0 has been put on the spot over his treachery as he normally speaks only to left - wing media who have published his leaks			1
lord @entity141 , a former @entity142 and security minister , said : ‘ since the revelations of the traitor @entity0 , terrorist groups have changed how they communicate and talk to each other			1
‘ his actions have made us all less safe			0
no doubt people will die who would not have died had he not been so irresponsible			0
’ @entity152 , of the @entity154 security think - tank , said : ‘ this is exactly the danger that those who believe @entity0 ’s actions were hugely irresponsible – and potentially fatal – warned of			1
‘ this interview seemed to show how little @entity0 had thought about the potentially deadly consequences			1
@entity0 stole a huge amount of sensitive documents and as a result terrorists and other serious criminals have adapted their methods accordingly			1
’ @entity0 handed an estimated 200,000 of the 1.7million stolen classified documents to journalists			1
in june 2013 , he told the @entity56 : ‘ i carefully evaluated every single document i disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest			0
’ this is a transcript of @entity0 ’s interview : @entity22 : how many of those documents have you actually read ? @entity0 : i ’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive			1
@entity22 : you ’ve read every single one ? @entity0 : i do understand what i turned over			1
' these things happen ' : @entity0 , above , during his television interview @entity22 : there ’s a difference between understanding what ’s in the documents and reading what ’s in the documents			1
@entity0 : i recognize the concern			1
@entity22 ( cuts in sarcastically ) : right , because when you ’re handing over thousands of @entity11 documents , the last thing you want to do is read them			0
( laughter ) @entity0 : i think it ’s fair to be concerned – did this person do enough , were they careful enough ? @entity22 ( cuts in ) : especially when you ’re handling material like we know you ’re handling			1
@entity0 : in my defence i ’m not handling anything any more			2
that ’s been passed to the journalists and they ’re using extraordinary security measures to make sure this is being reported in the most responsible way			0
asking the @entity209 : @entity22 @entity22 : but those are journalists with a lower technical skill set than you			0
@entity0 : that ’s true but they do understand like you and i do just how important it is to get this right			2
@entity22 : the @entity103 took a slide , it did n’t redact it properly and in the end it was possible to see that something was being used in @entity110 on @entity19			0
@entity0 : that is a problem			2
@entity22 : well , that ’s a * * * * - up			0
@entity0 : it is a * * * * - up and these things do happen in reporting			2
in journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made			0
this is a fundamental concept of liberty			0
@entity22 : right , but you have to own that then			0
you ’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there			0
@entity0 : yes , if people act in bad faith			2
@entity22 ( cuts in ) : we ’re not even talking about bad faith , we ’re talking about incompetence			0
@entity0 : we are , but you will never be completely free from risk if you ’re free			2
the only time you can be free from risk is when you ’re in prison			0
he added : ‘ there are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that i did n’t turn over , because harming people is n’t my goal			0
’ a report by the @entity154 last month revealed terror suspects were using human couriers instead of email and phones following the leaks by @entity0			2
@entity268 operations of @entity78 spies have been damaged , with @entity270 seizing on the information – making it harder to track down its operatives			2
@entity19 militants are known to have changed communication methods to avoid detection , and have produced a video advising fellow extremists on the matter			0
@entity10 has lost track of some of @entity78 ’s most dangerous criminals because of the way @entity0 exposed its operations			1
officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs , paedophiles , human traffickers and money launderers			0
the agency has also been forced to tone down or abandon surveillance amid fears the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to fall off the radar			0
mrs may told the @entity299 home affairs committee that the leaks ‘ did cause damage ’ , adding : ‘ it has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do			0
’ @entity0 , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity310 , tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy files in one of the biggest leaks in @entity13 history			1
he claims he had to act because the @entity13 government ’s policies were a ‘ threat to democracy ’			1
he fled to @entity322 , then @entity323 , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location			0
a @entity56 spokesman said the newspaper had ‘ nothing to add ’ in response to @entity0 saying he had ‘ evaluated ’ the documents and whether this had put people at risk			2
how the @entity56 changed headline to protect its favourite ' whistleblower ' the left - wing @entity56 newspaper climbed into bed with @entity0 when he leaked the top - secret intelligence documents , publishing a string of damaging stories			1
and yesterday it was still giving the so - called whistleblower an easy ride when reporting on his clash with tv host @entity22 on his @entity13 show @entity347			1
the initial story on the @entity56 website focused on the sensational revelation that @entity0 had apparently not read all the documents			2
the headline stated : ‘ @entity0 tells @entity22 he did not read all leaked @entity11 material			1
’ it added : ‘ the whistleblower admits his actions carried dangers			0
’ but within hours it had toned down the headline so it focused less on his irresponsibility and incompetence			0
it was changed to : ‘ @entity22 presses @entity0 on whether he read all leaked @entity11 material			1
’ the sub-heading was amended , to the softer : ‘ @entity79 host posts uncomfortable questions to @entity11 whistleblower in interview in @entity23			1
’ a @entity56 spokesman said the headline was changed because ‘ an earlier version stated that @entity0 admitted he had not read all the @entity11 documents he leaked			1
in fact he did not answer that question ’			0
the first @entity56 website story ... ... ...			0
and the later toned down version			0

@entity78 comedian travelled to @entity23 to interview the whistleblower
questions why the former @entity40 systems administrator leaked the files
gets him to explain the security threat in the context of nude pictures
describes @entity0 as @entity13 *'s* most *famous* ' hero and / or traitor '
@entity0 , at moments , is stunned into silence by the line of questioning
