@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was always first to show off his dancing skills whenever @entity3 won a trophy			1
unfortunately , his football was less memorable and he is destined to leave @entity6 in january as one of the most expensive follies in @entity10 history , alongside the likes of @entity12 and @entity13			0
@entity3 are prepared to let the 26 - year - old move back to his homeland in the new year with @entity17 and @entity18 leading the chase			1
and the @entity6 club do n't even want a transfer fee , so desperate are they to say ' @entity23 ' to one of sir @entity26 's worst - ever signings			2
@entity3 's pace was simply too quick for him and the smoking did n't help			2
@entity58 ( @entity59 ) bought : £ 32.5m from @entity60 , 2008 sold : £ 15m to @entity62 , 2010 loss : £ 17.5m skipped a @entity36 tie at @entity64 in his first month at the club to go back to @entity67			1
taken to task by @entity69 for his attitude in training @entity72 ( @entity73 ) bought : £ 35m from @entity74 : £ 15m to @entity75 : £ 20m @entity73 were panicked into buying @entity72 when @entity12 told them at the 11th hour he wanted to join @entity77			0
but @entity78 did n't fancy the big @entity79 and the club cut their losses @entity13 ( @entity77 ) bought : £ 31m from @entity62 , 2006 sold : free to @entity83 , 2009 loss : £ 31m cost @entity84 his job			1
the special one had won two titles when @entity88 gave him @entity89			0
the striker was badly past it and @entity84 was unable to handle the delicate situation the cost of bringing @entity0 to these shores for what he achieved is mind - boggling			1
the transfer fee from @entity28 in 2007 was an estimated £ 26million and he has earned the same again in wages since then			1
for the full £ 50m outlay , he has started 126 games in seven years , with another 53 appearances as substitute , and scored nine goals – around £ 5.5m a goal			0
his last , and almost certainly final , appearance in a @entity3 shirt came as a late substitute in a goalless draw against @entity41 in august			2
you have to go back to december 2012 for his last goal in a @entity3 shirt , against @entity112			1
he spent last season on loan to serie a club @entity115 but they did n't want him on a permanent basis either			0
it had all started so well for @entity0			2
on arrival , he was hailed as @entity3 's next midfield general , ready to carry the mantle when @entity121 ' called it a day			1
the early signs were promising			0
he played 38 times as @entity3 won the @entity10 and @entity124 in his debut season			2
he danced for the fans when they clinched the title in @entity129 and he danced next to @entity130 on a famous night in @entity131 when @entity3 became champions of @entity133 for the third time			2
he was in the @entity67 team , too			0
but something happened – and cynics would say the all - you - can - eat buffet			0
@entity0 's first season , when he scored in the penalty shootout in the @entity124 final , turned out to be his best			0
every succeeding year , he appeared that little bit heavier , that little bit more sluggish and less trusted by his manager			0
@entity0 was hailed as a prodigy when @entity3 agreed to buy him from @entity28 in 2007 for £ 26million the midfielder enjoyed some good times in his early years at @entity3 , playing alongside @entity149 @entity150 and @entity0 were signed at the same time in the summer of 2007 , but neither reached their potential in february 2010 , he ruptured a cruciate ligament against @entity75 and insisted the operation was done by a specialist he knew in @entity156			1
while still in rehab later that year , he was involved in a horrific car accident after leaving a nightclub at 6am , being pulled from a burning £ 125,000 @entity161 after it had crashed into a wall			0
by this time , @entity0 – once described as potentially ' better than @entity130 ' by sir @entity26 's brother @entity163 – was turning into a figure of fun to @entity3 team - mates rather than a serious player			1
@entity0 was never afraid of confrontation , as he showed by squaring up to @entity170 in 2007 it has been a difficult seven years in @entity172 for the midfielder , who was once heralded as a future star injuries have not helped the @entity1 's cause , and he has struggled for fitness in the past few seasons @entity0 has won eight caps for @entity67 but his career has never hit the heights despite his troubles , @entity0 picked up plenty of silverware at @entity6 , including the 2009 league title when @entity186 succeeded @entity26 , he took @entity0 on the team 's pre-season tour to hot and humid @entity189 , where @entity190 quipped in a video diary his job was to deliver @entity0 's burger at one o'clock in the morning			1
you did n't have to go far within @entity6 for @entity0 to be singled out as the individual who did n't buy into the club philosophy of displaying energy and hard work on the pitch			2
although he always possessed attacking flair , @entity0 picked up a reputation as a tough tackler the midfielder clashes with @entity59 assistant @entity204 after an @entity206 semi-final in 2011 @entity0 's first season , when he scored a penalty in the @entity124 final shoot - out , was his best now , with his contract due to run out in the summer without any hope of an extension , it looks as though @entity17 will take him back			1
@entity17 was where it all started for @entity0 when he was a teenager with the world at his feet , and he got his dream move to @entity133 with @entity28			1
@entity26 's report on @entity0 shortly before he retired was : ' has n't lived up to his potential '			0
sadly , it looks unlikely he ever will now			0

from battling @entity223 on international duty , @entity0 is set to go back to his first club @entity17 @entity0 celebrates scoring twice against @entity226 to book @entity3 's place in the @entity124 final at his best @entity0 could be a goal - scoring midfielder , who created chances and made tackles			1

@entity0 joined @entity3 for around £ 26million in 2007
the @entity67 midfielder has cost the club as much again in wages
@entity0 , once thought of as @entity121 ' replacement , never delivered
now the 26 - year - old could be going back to his first club @entity17
