we can not defeat radical @entity52 terrorism with a president who is unwilling to utter words radical @entity52 terrorism , ' fellow @entity46 @entity49 told conference guests on thursday afternoon while blasting @entity28 's ' bizarre orwellian doublespeak			1

continuing he said if the @entity58 puts ' together a coalition of armed regional governments to confront [ @entity50 ] on the ground with @entity58 special forces support , logistical support , intelligence support and the most devastating air support possible , ' he said , ' and you will wipe @entity50 out			2
' speaking at the conference later that day , @entity116 , the 2012 runner up for the @entity19 nomination for the presidency , said , ' if @entity50 wants to establish a seventh - century caliphate , well , let 's oblige them by bombing them back to the seventh century			1

' pretending it ’s not there does n’t make it go away , ' she said			2
calling it something else wo n’t make it so			0
' @entity124 , a tease who is not expected to run for president but remains a possible contender , said the @entity144 , whose spokesperson recently proclaimed the @entity58 can not kill its way out of a war with @entity50 , is ' naive			1
' ' really ? tell that to the @entity149 , ' @entity124 remarked			0
' oh wait , you ca n’t because they ’re dead			0

' commander in chief is not an entry - level position , ' @entity116 said			0
' and the @entity26 is no place for on - the - job training , not in times like this			0
' the former lawmaker said that unlike @entity28 , he predicted the ' gathering storm			2
' ' in the 1930s we could have known what the threat was			0
all we needed to do was read their books , and we will know what they want to do to the @entity58 ' he stated			0

' we need to heighten awareness of what this threat means and be honest about it , ' he stated , adding that he believes @entity234 prime minister @entity233 's speech to a joint session of @entity236 on tuesday ' is going to be really important			2
' retired neurosugreon @entity238 ' radical @entity52 terrorists all over the world ' threaten to ' destroy ' @entity58 ' he 's going to be able to tell the truth on this , ' @entity165 said of @entity233 's address , which is likely to be critical of the @entity28 administration 's policies toward @entity244 , a caliphate state			1
retired neurosugreon @entity246 , a long - shot contender for the presidency ' radical @entity52 terrorists all over the world ' threaten to ' destroy ' @entity58 and the ' @entity250 in @entity244 are every bit as dangerous , perhaps even more dangerous ' than @entity50			1
' we could take our eye off the ball as they develop nuclear weapons , ' he warned			0
@entity258 sen. @entity257 told the conservative audience that electing another @entity260 of @entity28 's ilk , namely @entity262 , would make ' us less safe			1

' jihadists now ' run amok ' in the country , he said			0
' they swim in our swimming pool , ' he added disdainfully			0
' i believe @entity262 ’s abdication of responsibility , her refusal to provide adequate defense for @entity280 , her dereliction of duty should forever preclude her from high office , ' the freshman lawmaker asserted , denigrating his possible general election foe			1
' it ’s time for @entity262 to permanently retire			2

@entity49 blasted @entity28 's ' bizarre orwellian doublespeak ' in refusing to label @entity50 an ' @entity52 ' terror group
