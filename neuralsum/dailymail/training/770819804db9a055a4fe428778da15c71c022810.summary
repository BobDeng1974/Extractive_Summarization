amazing : @entity0 with her son @entity1 , now one , after her ' serene ' freebirth at home ' every time a woman says " birth was awful , but my baby is worth it " , i 'm sad that they did n't have the chance to have a birth that made them say " it was the most amazing thing i have ever done , " ' says @entity0 , a 42 - year - old mother of six from the @entity14			1
@entity0 is one of a small number of women to choose ' freebirthing ' , a natural way to give birth without interference from doctors , nurses or midwives - even without going into hospital at all			1
two of her sons , eight - year - old @entity27 and two - year - old @entity1 , were born at home and birthed by @entity0 without the help of medical staff , a midwife or even the emotional support of a doula			1
the experience , she says , was ' amazing ' , adding : ' it was beautiful , it was serene and it was easier than running cross country at school ! ' but is ' freebirthing ' really all it ’s cracked up to be ? more importantly , can it really be possible to give birth unassisted without putting your life and the life of your child at risk ? unsurprisingly , the medical establishment is divided on the issue			1
some doctors argue that giving birth without assistance is far too dangerous			1
last year they released a statement saying midwives had ' no right ' to be present at a birth and that the wishes of mothers who chose not to have one present should be respected			2
@entity62 spokesperson dr @entity61 is quietly supportive of freebirthing , although she warns that things can sometimes go wrong			0
' some emergency situations are difficult to predict , ' she said in an interview with the @entity67			0
' there are problems that need intervention within minutes – for example , if the baby is getting distressed , if the baby 's shoulders get stuck , or if the cord prolapses			1
in any of these situations , you need a professional birth attendant who 'll know what to do and can arrange for you to transfer to hospital if you 're giving birth at home			1
' the alternative : for the majority of women , birth takes place in the unfamiliar confines of a hospital room more than 342,900 women die in childbirth every year around the world - most of them in developing countries			1
in the @entity97 , a woman 's lifetime risk of dying is just 1 in 8,000			2
in a tragic case last year , an @entity99 coroner openly criticised one mother 's decision to give birth unassisted after her baby died during delivery , according to reports in the @entity107			1
the umbilical cord became wrapped around @entity110 's neck - a situation , according to coroner @entity112 , that neither her mother @entity113 nor father @entity114 were equipped to deal with			2
but does that make it wrong ? no , insists veteran doula @entity117 , 39 , who says giving birth will never be entirely safe , whether it 's done at home or in a hospital			1
' there are no risk free options , ' she explains			0
' there are risks associated with birthing in hospital ; for instance , you 're statistically more likely to end up having a caesarean section when planning a birth overseen by consultant obstetricians			2
' you 're also statistically safer at home with midwives in attendance than you are in a consultant led unit			2
it is n't for me to say who should and should n't be making particular choices in life			0
' interestingly , the @entity146 study carried out by the @entity147 and published last week , would appear to back @entity117 ' claims			2
among the more startling revelations in the report was the fact that mothers giving birth at home are more likely to have normal deliveries and less likely to need invasive procedures such as caesarians and the use of forceps			1
@entity0 believes studies like this should be a wake up call to the medical profession			1
' there is a great deal of fear , and an unhealthy dose of arrogance , among those professionals who think that they know better when it comes to what is good for a woman than she does herself , ' she explains			0
' if something goes wrong during childbirth , the mother is the one who bears the pain for the rest of her life , not her care - givers , so only she can make the decision about what risks she is and is not prepared to take			0
' the death of your baby is n't the only outcome that might leave you in distress for the rest of your life			0
happy outcome : ultimately , both mothers and medical establishment want the same thing - a healthy baby ' @entity194 , feelings of having been abused , fear of death or danger in a situation where you feel out of control , harsh treatment and feeling violated during the birth process can all cause trauma			2
' a woman deserves to feel like a goddess when she brings her child into the world , and to be able to remember that feeling			0
' however , not all mothers find the experience of freebirthing as pleasant as they 'd hoped			0
@entity211 , 27 , who gave birth to her son @entity213 , now one , alone at home last year , was reported to social services by a midwife uncomfortable with her decision			1
' giving birth alone felt normal , ' she says			1
' it was liberating , natural , calm and wonderful			0
i did n't want to invite anyone else into [ my ] space			0
' but the run up to her ' wonderful ' birth was marred by an intervention from social services , and @entity211 feels things could have been handled very differently			1
' i understand the difficult position the midwife who made the referral may have found herself in , ' says @entity211 , ' but i do feel that there could have been a different approach			1
' she continues : ' i spoke to the supervisor of midwives twice about my plans and she seemed understanding and supportive so i was disheartened to find out about the referral			0
' i 'm upset about the way in which my life was intruded upon and the lack of decency and respect with which i and my family were treated			0
' upsetting though @entity211 's experience was , the midwife 's reaction , although contrary to advice issued by the @entity249 and the @entity52 , was perhaps understandable in light of how few freebirths there are each year			1
according to the most recent figures released by the @entity254 , 723,913 babies were born in 2011			0
of those , it is estimated that just 30 were freebirths			0
nevertheless , as information on freebirthing becomes more widely available , it 's likely that the numbers of women opting for unassisted births will increase			2
at the very least , says @entity0 , women need to know that they are n't required to submit to medical care and are free to decline any and all of it if they want to			1
' @entity268 is not right for everyone , ' she adds			2
' some women want to give birth surrounded by others and some women want others to take responsibility for them			0
' even if we all have the same information , we wo n't necessarily make the same choices and that is a good thing			0
but every woman should have the choice			0

@entity268 means giving birth without help from a doctor or midwife
@entity0 , 42 , from the @entity14 says her freebirth was ' amazing '
another mother , @entity211 , 27 , from @entity292 , called it ' liberating '
medical opinion is mixed with some arguing that it 's safer to be in hospital
study found that home births are less likely to require medical intervention
