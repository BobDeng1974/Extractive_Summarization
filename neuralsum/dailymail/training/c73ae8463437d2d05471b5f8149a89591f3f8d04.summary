@entity0 is a man who openly admits he ’s rather admiring of what he sees in the mirror			1
for the 45 - year - old it executive has a grooming ritual on a par with that of a supermodel — he works out every day and refuses to drink alcohol or eat carbohydrates on week days			2
but he also has another beauty secret , one done in private behind the bolted bathroom door of the four - bedroom home he shares with his fiancee and her young son in @entity16 , @entity17			1
45 - year - old it executive , @entity0 , started shaving his chest two years ago and he 's not the only one , a study by @entity22 last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair every week , he spends the best part of an hour shaving his chest			1
first he washes the area with one of his favourite upmarket soaps , then he applies some @entity29 for men shaving foam and removes the offending hair with a razor			1
afterwards , he lovingly massages in a post-shave healing lotion before applying tinted moisturiser			2
while such a routine might sound peculiar for a heterosexual father - of - two , for @entity0 it ’s a luxurious moment of ‘ me ’ time that he would n’t be without			1
‘ when i dress after having shaved my chest , ’ he says , ‘ i can only describe it as the wonderful feeling you get when you ’ve changed your bed sheets and then slip into them or stay in a posh hotel with fabulous @entity46 - cotton bed linen			1
when your smooth , hairless skin touches crisply ironed natural fabric , it ’s the most wonderful sensation , there ’s nothing like it			2
’ men with smooth chests such as @entity56 ( pictured ) , @entity57 and @entity58 are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century not only do @entity0 ’s two teenage children find his habit ridiculous , but so does his fiancee @entity63			1
indeed , she says , if she ’d discovered how obsessed he was with his grooming habits at their first meeting a year ago , there would n’t have been a second			1
‘ when i found out i was absolutely horrified , ’ remembers 40 - year - old @entity63 , a sleep counsellor and mother to @entity71 , seven			1
‘ we laugh about it now but i was quite disgusted at the time			2
‘ when we first got intimate , my initial reaction was to recoil in horror			2
at the gym , the guys like that are a total turn - off			2
they look so vain — they ’re always admiring themselves in the mirror			2
‘ i ’ve had to accept that @entity0 is exceedingly vain			1
it ’s pointless me trying to stop him indulging in his grooming habits			2
it ’s constant , i do come second place to his reflection			2
’ rather worryingly for those who cling to the idea that a hairy chest is a sign of virility , @entity0 is n’t an anomaly			1
indeed , it ’s part of a growing trend among middle - aged men			1
researchers even have a term for it — ‘ manscaping ’			2
a study by @entity22 last year found that 13 per cent of men have removed their chest hair and one - in - five feel expected to remove hair from their torso			1
@entity106 , non-surgical training manager at @entity107 , puts this down to the @entity109 : ‘ suddenly ordinary men were constantly exposed to athletic , fit and hairless bodies			1
they wanted to emulate them			2
they started working out and removing body hair too			2
’ indeed , it seems no @entity116 male is immune to temptation — the survey found 22 per cent of over- 65s felt pressure to remove or groom body hair			2
perhaps it ’s no wonder			2
men with smooth chests such as @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 are now held up as style icons rather than their hirsute counterparts of the 20th century			1
indeed @entity0 cites @entity57 as his icon			1
‘ when you look at the chests of today , ’ he claims , ‘ @entity57 is the ultimate pin - up			2
it ’s completely clear of hair and extremely well - toned and sculpted			0
he ’s like a @entity134 @entity133			0
’ @entity0 's fiancee @entity63 ( pictured ) was horrified when she first saw @entity0 's chest			1
she says : ' we laugh about it now but i was quite disgusted at the time ' @entity0 started shaving his chest two years ago , after coming out of a seven - year relationship , and denies it ’s in any way narcissistic			1
‘ with all of the stress involved [ in the break - up ] , i ’d let myself go , ’ he says			0
‘ one of my goals was to get in shape			0
there ’s no better indicator of being on the road to success at 45 than if you can see your abs in the mirror			0
i was hairy — it was hiding what was underneath			0
that was a motivating factor to start shaving , so that i could see the improvements under the hair			1
’ while @entity0 denies he ’s undergoing a mid-life crisis , @entity106 believes that this is often the case for 40 - something men			1
‘ if a chap is back on the market then the last thing he wants to see is grey hairs on his chest			1
if they ’re already discreetly dying their hair then they ’ll remove the give - away ageing signs on their chest			1
‘ society has moved on — they read the magazines , they go to the gym , they even talk to each other about it			0
men today do n’t want to look younger , they want to look good for their age			1
’ @entity182 , 40 , a building engineer and stepfather to four children aged 15 to 26 , has been shaving his chest and legs since his late teens			1
‘ i was 12 when i developed a moustache , ’ says @entity182 , who lives with his wife @entity188 in @entity189 , @entity190			0
‘ it was always commented on in the changing rooms that i was really hairy			0
‘ when i reached my late teens , someone dared me to shave off all of my hair			0
i thought it looked quite neat , i enjoyed the sensation of having smooth , hair - free skin			0
that ’s why i carried on doing it			0
’ even so , until recently it ’s a habit that he ’s kept to himself			0
‘ there has been a social prejudice that men ca n’t do this kind of thing			1
@entity203 in the past could n’t stand it and it has ended relationships			0
one in particular could n’t come to terms with me preferring to be hairless			0
‘ even my 15 - year - old stepson called me “ gay ” and said i ’m “ bizarre ” when he found out i shaved everywhere			0
but i ’d rather be smooth than hirsute			0
’ @entity188 , a 52 - year - old writer , is accepting of his habit			0
‘ i know a lot of men in their 40s and 50s who do it and they ’re all normal blokes in normal jobs			1
it ’s not just for metrosexuals or gay men any more			1
among my social circle are men who are quite vain — they dress nicely , do their nails and look after themselves			1
@entity229 is vain , i ’ve come to accept that			0
’ as with @entity182 , 48 - year - old @entity233 ’s trigger to shave his chest also came about in his teens , but for a far more serious reason			1
‘ i was 18 and i ’d just passed my driving test when i was involved in a horrific car accident			0
i spent months in hospital			0
@entity0 cites @entity57 ( pictured ) as his icon			1
‘ when you look at the chests of today , ’ he claims , ‘ @entity57 is the ultimate pin - up			0
it ’s completely clear of hair and extremely well - toned and sculpted ' ‘ when i was discharged , i was just 6st			0
at 5ft 11in i was desperately underweight and part of my rehabilitation included physiotherapy and weights			0
‘ i got into developing my chest and to chart my progress it was a natural step for me to shave			1
it made a difference seeing the skin and muscle tone develop			0
‘ it was 1985 and that kind of behaviour for a man was n’t the norm			0
i did keep quiet about it			0
everyone would snigger at oily , hair - free bodybuilders			0
i certainly did n’t want to be mocked either			0
’ the property developer , who lives with partner @entity265 , 43 , an art therapist , in @entity266 , @entity267 , has continued his habit to this day , relying on an electric razor to shave both his head and chest once a week			1
‘ while i keep in shape , i do n’t go to the gym any more , but i still like to shave my chest			1
if i ’m renovating a property , it ’s often too hot with body hair			0
i genuinely think i look better without a hairy chest			1
women prefer it , too			0
in my experience , not many women like rugs			0
’ @entity233 ’s partner @entity283 discovered by surprise that @entity233 shaved his chest when they were on holiday			2
‘ i thought it was really lovely he took pride in how he looked			0
i enjoy dressing up , putting on make - up , ensuring my hair looks nice for @entity233 and i like that he takes an interest in himself for me too			0
‘ @entity233 feels good about himself and more confident			0
it ’s a good thing for middle - aged men to do			2

@entity0 began shaving his chest two years ago
his fiancee @entity63 was initially horrified by the *revelation* but has learnt to live with it now
@entity0 is *n't* the only one , 13 *%* of men have admitted doing the same
