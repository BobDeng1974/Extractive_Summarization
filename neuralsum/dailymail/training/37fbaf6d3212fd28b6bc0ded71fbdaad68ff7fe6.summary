six years of hard luck stories have finally been put to bed			1
it was beautiful and ugly in equal measures at the @entity4 as @entity5 at last overcame their demons to secure the most tense and precious of victories over @entity8			1
there was to be no more choking in @entity10 - even if there were moments when @entity5 looked like coughing up their six - point lead			1
there were to be no more late slip - ups that have so often been part of the script in the previous run of 22 defeats by the @entity21 powerhouses			1
wales have a history of making life difficult for themselves in these big games			1
again they rode their luck , but four penalties from full back @entity30 proved enough to get @entity33 ’s side over that elusive line			2
‘ i could n’t watch the last ten minutes			2
i was watching it in the box on the tv			2
we took a different approach to this autumn and i think we ’re the only country that had the confidence or the courage to do that			2
we ’ve wounded one of the big beasts and they will come back fighting even harder next time			0
’ it was one of those ‘ pinch yourself ’ moments			0
@entity5 had one previous win in 108 years and 29 tests against the @entity120 , but now the monkey is off their back			1
with less than 12 months until the @entity124 , the psychological boost will be invaluable			0
no more talk of ‘ hoodoos ’ and just , in the words of skipper @entity37 , talk about moving forwards			0
‘ we ’ve been in that position so many times that it did n’t feel alien , ’ said @entity37			0
‘ there was more talk in that last five minutes than i ’ve ever heard			0
that ’s where we ’ve made mistakes in the past			0
for me this is a career highlight			0
now we ’ve set the standard and we need to kick on			0
’ @entity5 started with intent , fly half @entity43 setting the early standard with some sublime handling			1
they retained possession through 12 phases and , after @entity60 was taken out off the ball , @entity30 kicked his first penalty to open the scoring			0
but @entity8 no 10 @entity80 quickly levelled from 46 metres			1
the hosts enjoyed more possession in the opening quarter but aggressive counter-rucking from the @entity8 acted to stem the flow of attack			1
not even a 15 - man line - out could push @entity5 over the line as their opponents absorbed all pressure			2
beautiful it was not , with the half time score level , as had been the case against both @entity160 and @entity161			0
@entity8 's captain @entity162 is carried off the field on a stretcher wales beat @entity8 12 - 6 at home at the @entity4 in @entity10 @entity77 of @entity8 passes the ball during their defeat in @entity5 @entity30 of @entity5 kicks a penalty during the international match between @entity5 and @entity8 at the @entity4 @entity5 116 ( 17 ) 81 222 3 4 30 18 10 6/10 14/17 64/69 50 % 53 % tackles ( missed ) carries metres clean breaks offloads kicks ( hand ) turnovers pens against scrums won lineouts won @entity181 possession territory @entity184 83 ( 6 ) 103 237 4 4 30 16 12 6/6 8/8 76/83 50 % 47 % wales take little comfort from what has occurred before			1
there was a cynical feeling of inevitability around the @entity4 but some of those demons were eased when @entity37 won a 47th - minute penalty , which was kicked by @entity30 to put his side back in front , although again it was cancelled out by @entity80			1
it was turning into an arm wrestle ; an ugly scrap offering more tension than spectacle			0
again the responsibility fell on @entity30 to keep the scoreboard rolling and two penalties from the @entity205 star , one following an unstoppable drive from the @entity208 scrum , put his side six points ahead with less than half an hour remaining			2
physicality is part and parcel of this fixture and @entity8 skipper @entity162 was the first to drop , with the 105 - cap centre requiring an oxygen supply as he was carted off with a dislocated kneecap			1
when winger @entity54 was shown a yellow card in the 63rd minute for taking out @entity30 in the air , it looked like fortune might finally be about to favour the @entity208			0
‘ the yellow card was a turning point because we had to go into defensive mode , ’ said @entity8 head coach @entity223			1
‘ i do n’t know if it ’s worthwhile going up in the air anymore because it ’s always going to be 50 - 50			2
it ’s a grey area that we need to sort out			0
the referee is always right and we have to face that			0
’ this was the time to turn the screw			0
@entity5 pushed and pushed but , with the line at his mercy , hooker @entity62 fell just short			0
if @entity8 were going to come back , that would be the costly moment			1
memories of @entity240 , when @entity5 coughed up a 17 - point lead , began to creep in			2
@entity8 full - back @entity243 was their tormentor in june but , against the odds , the gifted @entity242 was guilty of the an amateur handling error on his own five - metre line			1
still @entity5 failed to capitalise and , with @entity54 back on the field , errors began to creep into their game			0
all of a sudden @entity8 are camped deep in opposition territory but @entity5 held on , just , to secure one of their most famous victories			1

wales have only beaten @entity8 twice in 108 years
this win in @entity10 ended a *painful* 22 - match losing streak against the @entity8
@entity43 put in a top *performance* for the @entity269 at the @entity4
