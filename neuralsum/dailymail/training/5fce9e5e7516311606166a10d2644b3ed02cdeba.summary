fizzy drinks and sweet treats should be doubled in price to prevent an epidemic of tooth decay , according to researchers			1
they are calling for a 100 per cent sugar tax to be slapped on soft drinks and confectionary to deter the public from consuming such vast quantities			1

professor @entity48 , lead researcher , said a number of drastic proposals were needed including sugar tax of at least 20 per cent but ideally 100 per cent			0
this would raise the price of a can of @entity55 to 84p , a @entity57 bar to £ 1.20 and a @entity59 ice cream to £ 2.50			1
writing in the journal @entity61 , he also called for other drastic measures including schools to stop serving fruit juice and vending machines to be banned from public places			0
professor @entity48 said : ‘ a sugars tax should be developed to increase the cost of sugar - rich food and drinks			2

‘ the retail price of sugary drinks and sugar rich foods needs to increase by at least 20 per cent to have a reasonable effect on consumer demand so this means a major tax on sugars as a commodity			1

‘ we are not talking draconian policies to ‘ ban ’ such sugar - rich products , which are available elsewhere , but no publicly - supported establishment should be contributing to the expensive problems of dental caries , obesity and diabetes			0
’ ‘ we need to make sure that use of fruit juices and the concept of sugar - containing treats for children are not only no longer promoted , but explicitly seen as unhelpful			0

the government says it has no plans for a sugar tax and instead is working with food and drinks manufacturers to make products less sweet			2
