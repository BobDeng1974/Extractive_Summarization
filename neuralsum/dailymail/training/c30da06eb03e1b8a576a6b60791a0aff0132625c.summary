out of touch ? @entity2 is estimated to be worth upwards of $ 500 million discussion topic : @entity2 's tome sparked controversy when it hit the shelves in march ' what i am recommending is that as we think about being good colleagues , being good workers , being good employers , we ask people " how do you feel " , not just how you think because so many of our decisions are based on how we feel , ' she said			1
@entity2 , who is married with two young children , said on the subject of her book ' the messages of believing in yourself and sitting at the table , getting compensated fairly , those can happen at any point in your career			1

@entity123 , ' said @entity2			0
