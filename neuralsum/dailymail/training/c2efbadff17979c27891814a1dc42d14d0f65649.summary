by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity2 's love of himself was the main reason behind @entity6 's @entity5 failure , according to former @entity8 midfielder @entity7			1
the 29 - year - old , who was announced as the world 's best player earlier this year , failed to inspire his country to glory in @entity14 as they crashed out at the group stage behind @entity17 and the @entity18			1
but his form for his club helped @entity21 to a 10th @entity23 win , despite a poor showing from their @entity26 talisman at the final in @entity29 against @entity30			1
' @entity2 is an amazing player and he showed that again in @entity14 , even if he missed a number of chances , ' @entity7 said in his column for @entity50 paper @entity49			2
' but his biggest flaw is the way he looks at himself and the team			0
ouch : @entity2 falls under a challenge and @entity6 's campaign was generally miserable in @entity14 with just one win different player : @entity2 had a great season with @entity21 but could n't inspire @entity6 as their captain @entity61 scoring goals for @entity26 ' he scored the 4 - 1 in the 120th minute of the @entity23 final and celebrated like he was insane			1
that was the ultimate proof that he loves himself			0
the headlines should be about the team , not about @entity2			0
' the same thing happened with @entity6 in @entity14			0
there was no order or discipline			0
all the @entity6 players were playing their own game and more occupied with their hair and tattoos			0
' it 's almost as if the players wanted to show there 's more to @entity6 than @entity2			2
it 's a sad thing that a team loses its identity because of an unbalanced captain , both for @entity2 and for an entire generation			2
' ' insane ' : @entity2 celebrated wildly after scoring the fourth goal in @entity21 's 4 - 1 @entity23 final victory winner : despite any downside to @entity2 's ego , @entity21 picked up the cup ahead of their city rivals @entity30			1

@entity91 winner crashed out at the group stage at the @entity5
but he managed to win the @entity23 with @entity21
@entity7 says @entity2 is ' amazing ' but looks at himself before team
former @entity8 man says he has *ruined* a generation for @entity6
