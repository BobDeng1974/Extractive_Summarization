it seems that the subject matter of the @entity3 assassination film @entity2 was a problem at @entity5 long before they were hacked by a group hoping to stop the film 's release			1
in emails that were leaked on thursday , @entity5 chief executive officer @entity9 writes @entity11 asking that scenes from the movie featuring @entity3 be removed or edited			1
@entity14 then shares this information with the film 's star , writer and director , @entity16 , who is none too happy			1
' that is a very damning story			0
' @entity14 tried to explain herself to @entity16 , saying ; ' as embarrassing as this has been from my point of view , you have to appreciate the fact that we have n't just dictated to you what it had to be			2
' she then adds , ' this is n't some flunky			0
it 's the chairman of the entire @entity5 who i am dealing ( with )			2
' indeed , in one email , @entity9 tells @entity14 : ' i ’ve given this a lot of thought and would like to go ahead with a variation of version 337			2
' it would be much appreciated if you could push them a bit further as you mentioned in your e-mail			0
also , please ensure that this does not make it into the international version of the release			0
' in another email @entity14 cites the proximity of @entity29 to @entity68 as another reason changes might be necessary			1
' i have n’t the foggiest notion how to deal with @entity68 politics as it relates to @entity29 so all i can do is make sure that @entity5 wo n’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective , ' she tells @entity16			1
@entity16 agrees to make the changes , though @entity14 does put in an email to @entity9 that there was some ' resistance from the filmmakers			1
' her again : @entity5 head @entity11 ( above ) was tasked with telling @entity16 he had to make changes the changes , which have to do with a major plot point , seem to take some time to deal with , and @entity16 completes the task to @entity9 's liking it would seem by october , writing in his final email , ' please tell us this is over now			1
' and while he may have been annoyed and angered , @entity16 is still very much a fan of @entity14 , praising her thursday evening at the premiere of the film			1
' we want to thank @entity11 for having the balls to make this movie , ' said @entity16			1
ironically , however , the film is not set to open in @entity98			0
the @entity99 reports that a ' softer ' version of the film - edited to take out gore - got approval from executives overseeing @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109			0
executives from @entity111 and @entity112 , however , asked for the unedited versions - saying they wanted to ' sock it to ' em ' - presumably referring to @entity29			0
execs from the @entity117 and @entity118 wanted to gorier version , too			0
the changes are also described in the emails , though they spoil the film , which is set to open on december 25			0
this is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves @entity126 , who , as previously mentioned , want to stop the release of @entity2			0
@entity14 said in an interview thursday that every employee 's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack , meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months			2
it is believed that a group from @entity29 is behind the hack			0
the scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails , and show what an amusing and out there film @entity2 will be warning : spoilers ! @entity5 executives ordered @entity16 to tone down a scene in which @entity3 is hit with a tank shell , causing his head to explode			1
in one email , @entity14 writes to @entity146 : ' in shot # 337 there is no face melting , less fire in the hair , fewer embers on the face , and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire , as well as darkened to look less like flesh			2
' she then adds , ' we arrived at this shot ( # 337 ) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers			0
' in another email , @entity162 , president of @entity164 motion picture group , wrote to @entity14 ; ' in the interest of getting this approved , i would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball			2
' @entity146 also requested that the scene where @entity3 's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the @entity31 .			1

the **ceo** of @entity5 asked @entity5 chair @entity11 to make changes to the *upcoming* film @entity2
in newly released emails from the @entity5 hack he asks that key scenes involving @entity3 be edited and changed
@entity14 than relays this information to the star , writer and director of the film , @entity16 , who is not to happy
' this is now a story of @entity31 changing their movie to make @entity29 happy , ' writes @entity16 in one email
@entity16 eventually made the changes , and at the premiere of the film last night praised @entity14 for having the ' balls ' to make the picture
@entity5 's @entity68 **ceo** : make sure @entity3 death scene is *censored* outside of the @entity31
