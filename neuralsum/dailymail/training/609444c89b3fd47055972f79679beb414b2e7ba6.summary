@entity0 has been selected to run the marathon for @entity2 at the @entity3 in july			1
but when the 40 - year - old lines up next to his competitors it will mark another memorable chapter in a journey that has seen him transformed from an overweight smoker with a penchant for takeaways into an athlete who runs 130 - 140 miles a week while holding down a job in a bank			1
he came to the attention of many when he entered the @entity19 and was the third @entity21 competitor to finish behind @entity22 and @entity23			1
turnaround : @entity0 was 16 stone and smoked 20 a day , now he 's set to run for @entity2 in @entity26 a time of 2.16.27 saw @entity0 finish within the two hour 17 mark and become eligible for selection for the @entity3 in @entity26 , something which seemed a million miles off even recently			1
@entity0 told @entity31 : ‘ i am a one - man band : a self - coached club runner			1
‘ at school i was the guy who hid in the bushes with my fat mate during the first lap of the cross country and then rejoined the field when they came round again			0
‘ i have never competed in a major championship before and until recently i had almost no contact with @entity44			0
and now i will be running at the @entity3			2
’ long haul : way breaking the @entity21 all time 100km road record at the @entity47 way 's lifestyle has changed dramatically in the seven years since he decided to take up running as a means of getting fit and losing weight			2
@entity0 said : ‘ towards the end of 2007 i could hardly sleep at night			0
i was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife too			0
‘ at that point half our meals were takeaways and i would eat chocolate and sweets all the time			0
‘ i was 16 1/2 stone and realised i had to do something radically different to break the cycle			0

@entity0 came to *prominence* following the @entity19
his finishing time *qualified* him for @entity3 selection
way used to weigh 16 - and - a - half stone and before deciding to get fit
the 40 - year - old runs 130 - 140 miles a week and works full time in a bank
