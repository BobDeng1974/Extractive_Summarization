my son made the ultimate sacrifice and i should be able to honour his memory , ' said mrs @entity16			1
' people can have several partners , but they will only ever have one mother			0
' we are the ones who walked the floor with them for hours when they cried and wiped their knees when they fell			0
' it 's as if the parents have been cast aside			1
' @entity18 had selflessly gone back to help a comrade when the device exploded , killing him instantly			1
sergeant @entity51 's mother @entity50 , 56 , ( pictured together ) said she is ' astonished ' by the decision as the service falls just before @entity54 sgt @entity51 ( right ) , of the @entity55 , married just a few years before he stepped on an ied while on patrol in 2009 , pictured with his mother @entity50 ' as a parent nothing can prepare you for your child dying before you - and nothing can prepare you for being denied an invitation when there is an opportunity to remember them , ' said his mother			1
' his wife may receive an invitation , but as we have n't seen each other in years , it 's highly unlikely she 'll ask me to be her plus one			0
' mrs @entity16 has been in contact with other bereaved parents who have found themselves in the same situation since the service was announced by @entity78 on wednesday			1
they are now calling on the @entity80 to remember mothers and fathers			2
@entity83 , from @entity84 , @entity85 , whose son @entity18 was killed in @entity87 in 2009 , said she feels as though parents are being ' alienated '			1
' it 's not right â€“ i think it should be the wife or husband and parents who attend , ' she said			2

' i do n't mean to sound selfish , but @entity18 was my only child			1
i carried him for nine months , brought him up and nurtured him			0
' @entity83 , whose son @entity18 ( pictured together ) was killed in @entity87 in 2009 , said she feels as though parents are being ' alienated ' acting sergeant @entity104 's ( left ) legal next of kin is wife @entity105 , who married the soldier just six months before he was killed in action with 3 @entity108 , the @entity109 acting sergeant @entity104 's legal next of kin is wife @entity105 , who married the soldier just six months before he was killed in action with 3 @entity108 , the @entity109			1
as @entity18 , 22 , was married , it is @entity105 who will be invited to the 2,000 - capacity commemoration			1

' it 's not an issue with the partners			0
it 's the @entity157 's lack of compassion for parents who have lost their children , ' said mrs @entity137			2
' what annoys me more than anything else is that there will be 453 next of kin and one other , the rest will be dignitaries who never met our children			2
' ex-partners can move on , but parents ca n't			2
i have had a hole in my heart ever since he died			0

he served with the @entity175 , who have been very inclusive of @entity137 so far			0
' it 's bizarre that a local regiment could be so supportive , but as soon as there 's a national event , i 'm left out			0
i effectively gave my son to the forces , ' said his mother			2
' i do n't want anybody to forget my son - or where he came from			2
that 's why it 's so important for parents , especially mums , to be able to attend these types of events			0
' @entity29 , 61 from @entity191 , whose son corporal @entity28 , 29 was killed in a convoy , which hit an ied in september 2007 , feels the same way , ' it is disgusting , the way we have been treated			1
he had only been married for 12 weeks			0
the @entity200 , the @entity201 , senior politicians , military chiefs and veterans of the campaign have all been handed tickets , pictured is corporal @entity28 with his children ' he had twins from a previous relationship and she ca n't attend either			1
i have no relationship with his current partner , so there is no way i could get a ticket from her			0

we would n't have the best army in the world without us mothers , @entity78 is a disgrace			0
' sergeant @entity51 's mother @entity50 , 56 , said she is ' astonished ' by the decision as the service falls just before @entity54			2

' i was n't issued with an invite , i had to fight for one			0

the fact that the memorial service next month falls just days before @entity54 and mothers are being denied access astonishes me			0

a spoksperson for the @entity157 said : ' this service is intended to honour the contribution of all those who served in @entity2 from 2001 , whether the 100,000 military personnel or the civilians that worked there			2
' unavoidably , limited capacity at @entity8 's means we are unable to include everyone who would wish to attend but by reserving half of the congregation places we are ensuring that two people with close ties to anyone who lost their life in @entity2 can attend			2
' the rest of the congregation will be made up of @entity278 personnel and civilians who served in @entity2 , veterans , international partners and supporting organisations			0
