@entity0 : the former archbishop of @entity2 told an audience at the @entity4 he knew two clerics who were being held hostage by @entity7 in the @entity8 @entity0 used a literary festival speech to raise the plight of two @entity12 archbishops kidnapped by @entity7 extremists in @entity14			1
the former archbishop of @entity2 told an audience at the @entity4 he knew two clerics who were being held hostage in the @entity8			1
he spoke of them in a wide - ranging talk on ' @entity20 ' , in which he insisted the @entity21 ca n't ignore the ' poisonous ' effects of religious - inspired tyranny in the region			2
lord @entity0 had been asked by a woman in his audience if it was not time for the @entity28 and the country to speak out about what is happening to @entity31 in the @entity8			1
' five hundred @entity31 including women and children have been buried alive , ' she said			1
' they have been executed and thousands of @entity31 have been confined			1
' surely it is time we spoke up on that ? it can not suely be open season on @entity31 entirely yet ? ' lord @entity0 replied : ' i could n't agree more			1
' many have been speaking up and i hope more will			0
one of the dangers we face at the moment is the rise of a particular kind of religious tyranny in that region whose results both locally and globally are lessons for us all			0
' we can not turn our backs on that			0
i have people i know who are currently being held in the @entity8 including two bishops in @entity14 and i am waiting to find out their fate			1
' it is not academic - i am glad there are people speaking out			0
' he did not name the pair , but he was apparently referring to @entity61 of the @entity62 and bishop @entity63 of the @entity64			2
gunmen pulled the pair from their car and killed their driver in april last year while they were traveling outside the northern city of @entity70			2
bishop @entity71 of the @entity72 - based @entity62 said at the time that the gunmen were believed to be @entity75 fighters from @entity76 , a radical @entity77 faction in the @entity14 opposition			2
such radicals have become increasingly influential among rebels , attacking @entity31 — a sizable minority in @entity14 who they see as infidels — partly as punishment for their support of president @entity86			1
@entity86 's government has meanwhile sought to portray itself as a protector of religious minorities , expending much effort in defending @entity12 holy sites and villages			1
the quick rise of the so - called @entity94 , a @entity96 insurgent group which has gained control of much of north - east @entity14 and northern @entity98 , has helped the pariah regime to position itself as moderate and multicultural			1
kidnapped : bishop @entity63 of the @entity64 , left , and bishop @entity61 of the @entity62 , right , were kidnapped by @entity77 gunmen close to @entity70 , northern @entity14 , last year war zone : lord @entity102 was apparently referring to @entity103 of the @entity62 and bishop @entity63 of the @entity64 who were snatched near @entity70 , pictured mr @entity0 , asked to compare is with the evils committed in the past by the @entity108 , admitted there could be such a thing as ' toxic religion '			1
pointing out that most @entity112 see is as breaking cherished religious laws , he conceded that in @entity12 history , too , there had been ' horrendous periods , where human dignity in the fullest sense has been overruled			2
' ' @entity31 endorsed slavery at one time but then provided the arguments which overturned it , ' he said			2
lord @entity0 was also asked whether he believes it is right for the @entity28 to continue to have a ' privileged position as an established church in a liberal @entity126			0
' ' my sense of it is that i would n't start from here ! ' he said			0
'' but at the same time , here is where we are			0
' his instinct to calls for the @entity28 to be dis - established was to be ' bloody minded , ' he said			0
' i am a bit inclined to drag my heels and say it is one of the things which allows society to say that the religious perspective still has a foot in the door , ' he said			0
' other religious communities feel it allows them to have a foot in the door as well			0
' there are people who feel that the @entity28 bishops in the @entity152 are there on their behalf			0
odd though it is , and quite irrational though it is , i am not in any hurry to get rid of it i must say ! '			0
