the @entity0 is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer - stricken five - year - old @entity2 made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment			1
@entity7 - based @entity6 , is to open the treatment centres , which will be available to @entity10 cancer patients , in @entity7 , @entity11 and @entity12 by 2017 , with the first in the @entity15 capital being operational by next year			1
the announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer @entity2 told of how he was given the ' all - clear ' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in @entity22			1
mr and mrs @entity2 had wanted their son to have the cutting - edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy			2
fearing that @entity2 would be taken away from them and given the treatment , the family fled to @entity47 before travelling to the @entity48 to the @entity49			0
now , a group called @entity6 has now been formed in the @entity0 following discussions between professor sir @entity52 , the life sciences entrepreneur and @entity0 life sciences and healthcare investors			0
they have committed almost £ 100million equity finance into the company			0
professor @entity59 , senior consultant at the @entity60 , has been appointed chairman of the group , and professor @entity63 has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company , alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts			0
@entity2 , with his parents @entity29 and @entity30			0
the @entity71 defiantly fled to @entity47 in a bid to get @entity2 to the @entity49 in @entity22 and protect him from the devastating side effects of @entity10 treatment professor @entity59 said : ' this is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the @entity0			1
as things stand , patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment , often at great expense to the @entity10			2
' the creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the @entity0			0
' while sir @entity52 added : ' we are delighted that the @entity0 's first centre will be based in @entity7 and @entity92 is proud to support this breakthrough			2
while conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells , often damaging surrounding tissue , proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour			1
because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue , particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour			0
while radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function , proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects			1
this means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas , such as brain cancer			0
however , @entity118 estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long - term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known			1
the only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the @entity126 in the @entity127 , @entity128 , which delivers ' low energy ' therapy for rare cancers around the eye			1
the @entity10 currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the @entity134 for treatment			1
they must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment			0
more than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of £ 100,000 per patient			0
' there are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the @entity0 and the demand for treatment is growing			0
' it is anticipated that @entity10 demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017			1
@entity6 will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the @entity0 as of next year			0
' in addition to state of the art @entity6 ' treatment services , the @entity7 centre will provide conventional radiotherapy , chemotherapy and supportive care			2
@entity6 beam therapy is a highly - targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard - to - reach cancers , such as spinal tumours , with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects			1
the government has announced that it is to create two @entity10 proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018			1
the @entity71 faced every parent 's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms			1
but the family 's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal @entity10 radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities			2
and despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy , the @entity71 defiantly fled to @entity47 in a bid to get @entity2 to the @entity49 in @entity22 and protect him from the devastating side effects of @entity10 treatment			1
they were arrested by @entity196 authorities and banned from seeing their sick son , with a high court judge only approving the move to @entity22 after they had been released			0
when he finally arrived at the centre in september last year , @entity2 was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes			2
but in october , he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras , thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in @entity207 , @entity47 , and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother @entity212			0
since then , he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life			0
however , despite the treatment and his recovery , @entity2 's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the @entity0 , his grandmother said last month .			2

the three centres are *planned* for @entity7 , @entity11 and @entity12
they will offer proton beam therapy to *private* and @entity10 cancer patients
hoped the first centre in @entity7 will be up and running by next year
@entity2 , five , made a ' miracle recovery ' after receiving the therapy to treat a brain tumour
