judges have expressed ' great concern ' after being forced to overturn the indefinite sentence imposed on a dangerous paedophile who will now serve just 18 months behind bars			0
@entity7 twice tried to convince a 15 - year - old boy to perform a sex act online and shared sickening images of children with other perverts , @entity6 ’s @entity5 heard			1
he was jailed indefinitely for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at @entity15 in march , after computer equipment was seized by police from his home in @entity19 , @entity20			0
court : mr justice @entity22 , left , and mr @entity23 , right , said a sexual offences prevention order handed to @entity7 should be ' vigorously enforced ' the 36 - year - old admitted three counts of trying to incite a child to engage in sexual activity , six of making , nine of distributing and five of possessing indecent images of children , and one of having an extreme pornographic image			1
but his open - ended sentence has now been quashed at @entity6 ’s @entity35 and replaced with a conventional jail term of three years			0
lord @entity37 was among the judges who were anxious about the outcome judges said that , while they were deeply anxious about the outcome , the law on indeterminate sentences laid down by @entity44 left them with ‘ no alternative ’ but to quash @entity7 ’s @entity46			0
the decision means that , instead of remaining behind bars until the @entity49 concludes it is safe to release him , @entity7 will now be automatically released after serving half of the three - year term			1
judge @entity53 , sitting with @entity52 and mr @entity23 , said a sexual offences prevention order handed to @entity7 should be ‘ vigorously enforced ’ by the probation service to ensure he does n’t re-offend after his release			0
the judge told the court @entity7 ’s computer equipment , including a laptop , webcam and four discs , were seized from his home in september last year			2
before the equipment was analysed , he admitted to police he had downloaded pornographic images of children and had spoken to other paedophiles on @entity69 - but claimed he had no sexual interest in children			2
analysis of the machine revealed over 200 indecent images of children - including five in the most obscene category - and it was discovered these had been sent to other people via the internet			2
@entity7 had also tried to groom a 15 - year - old boy via a chat website on two separate occasions , but the victim had ended the conversation before any sexual activity took place			1
decision : @entity7 was jailed indefinitely for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at @entity15 ( pictured ) in march a probation report concluded @entity7 was a danger to the public and there was a real threat that his ‘ fantasies ’ about children would result in him reoffending			1
the court heard he had a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a three - year - old 20 years earlier , when he was aged 15			1
sentencing him , the crown court judge said a five - year sentence would have been appropriate for the offences , but that he was ‘ dangerous ’ and should therefore be locked up indefinitely			1
@entity7 ’s lawyers argued the five - year ‘ notional term ’ was too long , saying the crown court judge did n’t take enough account of the overall sentence or the level of his offending			1
@entity6 's @entity107 heard how @entity7 ’s computer equipment , including a laptop , webcam and four discs , were seized from his home in september allowing the appeal , judge @entity22 agreed the term was ‘ excessive ’ and that the @entity46 must be quashed - as indefinite sentences can only be imposed where the offences would justify a conventional sentence of at least four years			2
he told the court : ' we consider that the judge ’s finding of dangerousness was fully justified on the evidence before him			0
' but , by reason of this court ’s decision to reduce the notional determinate term , a sentence of imprisonment for public protection was not available			0
' we have great concern as to the outcome			0
but , as @entity44 has laid down that the notional term must be at least four years for an indeterminate sentence to be imposed , we have no alternative but to quash the @entity46			0
