@entity1 manager @entity0 has stepped up his charm offensive in an attempt to spark a move for @entity6 midfielder @entity5			1
the former city manager wants to bring @entity5 to @entity1 after his spell as boss of the @entity11 midfielder powerhouse at the @entity12 between 2010 and 2013			1
and @entity0 has cheekily hinted that @entity5 would fancy a move to @entity14 after a difficult season with @entity6 chasing @entity16 in the @entity18 title race			1
@entity5 ( left ) is wanted by @entity0 ( right ) at @entity1 after their time at @entity6 @entity0 poses with @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity5 and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) when signing them ' @entity5 has played in every @entity25 , apart from @entity26 and @entity14 , ' @entity0 said			1
' if , as it seems , he wants to have an experience in @entity14 , then there is this possibility he could come here			0
' it wo n’t be easy , but he ’s a player with incredible technique and character			0
would @entity1 be his first choice ? that ’s certain			0
' @entity0 claims @entity5 ' seems ' to want a move to @entity1 despite having two years left on his @entity6 contract @entity0 is back as @entity1 manager and wants to bring high - profile players to @entity14 's @entity40 @entity5 has two years left on his @entity6 contract , and there seems no chance that the @entity18 champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of @entity48 's team			1
and @entity48 has spoken out previously to confirm that @entity5 will not be leaving - not that it 's stopping @entity0			2
last month @entity48 said : ' i do n’t have an opinion about what another manager says about @entity5			0
' of course , every manager of every team would want @entity5 in their team but i do n’t have anything to say about that			0
' @entity5 rues a missed chance for @entity6 - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year @entity48 says @entity0 can forget about signing toure but the @entity63 wo n't seem to back down and @entity0 certainly seems interested in his former players , having also tried to sign @entity6 youth product from @entity66 , where he is on loan , in january			1
' we did try to get him , as he was my player at @entity6 , ' @entity0 told @entity70			2
' @entity66 seemed open to it , but the move did n’t go through			0
' @entity0 's @entity1 are struggling in @entity40 this season and face missing out on @entity75 football again , with the @entity1 sitting ninth in the table .			2

@entity1 manager @entity0 wants @entity6 's @entity5
@entity5 played under @entity0 in @entity80 's @entity18 winning side of 2012
@entity0 says it seems @entity5 wants to move to @entity14 with @entity1 his no 1 pick
city are unlikely to want to sell such a *key* player despite @entity5 being *31*
