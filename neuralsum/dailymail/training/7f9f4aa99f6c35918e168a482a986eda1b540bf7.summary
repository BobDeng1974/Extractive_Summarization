miss @entity1 , of @entity2 in @entity18 had always dreamed of a life working at 36,000 feet for the airline			2
but once she told interviewers that she had a discreet tattoo of the word ' @entity24 ' , which is her star sign , her hopes were dashed			2
the 20 - year - old said : ' i had put on a smart dress , pinned my hair up in a bun , put on heels and applied some red lipstick			0
' it was all going well until the woman said , " do you have any tattoos ? " i said yes and the woman looked mortified			0
straightaway , she dropped her pen and said it was over			0
' i was n't even given a chance			0
i was humiliated and had to shuffle past all the other candidates on my way out			0
' @entity5 is currently the subject of a @entity46 documentary called ' a very @entity48 airline ' , which has shown the strict standards the company has when employing cabin crew			1

she added : ' if you go to any @entity55 and picked 10 people at random , i bet eight of them will have a tattoo			0
the tattoo , which spells out her star sign @entity24 on her foot , which she believes would have been covered by the tights cabin crew wear as uniform the 20 - year - old , who is a college student and also works as an admin clerk says @entity5 ' needs to get with the times ' ' mine is so small and discreet - plus you would n't even see it underneath the black tights you have to wear as part of the @entity5 uniform			1
