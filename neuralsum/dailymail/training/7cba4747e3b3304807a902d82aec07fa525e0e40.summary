by @entity0 last updated at 12:51 am on 18th november 2011 repair kit : research shows breast milk is rich in stem cells with the chameleon - like properties normally found in those taken from embryos breast milk contains stem cells that could potentially beat diseases from @entity11 ’s to cancer , according to scientists			1
the milk , intended by @entity15 to give babies the best start in life , is rich in stem cells , which have the chameleon - like properties found in those taken from embryos			2
the milk could provide a ready and ethical source of stem cells , which are widely seen as a ‘ repair kit ’ due to their potential to turn into any cell type in the body			2
cancer , blindness , diabetes , @entity11 ’s and @entity32 ’s diseases and paralysis could all potentially be healed by the power of ‘ master cells ’			1
the use of embryonic stem cells is mired in controversy because harvesting them from an embryo leads to its death			1
but the @entity42 reported that breast milk stem cells can turn into bone cells , cartilage , fat , brain , liver and pancreas , a breastfeeding conference will hear next year			1
researcher @entity51 , of the @entity52 , said : ‘ breast milk offers a new exciting opportunity for stem cell therapies			2
’ @entity56 , professor of regenerative medicine at @entity57 , said more proof is needed that the cells are as versatile as billed , but added : ‘ if they are truly embryonic , this will be another way of getting stem cells that would not raise ethical concerns			2
’ even if they do not turn out to be as versatile as hoped , said @entity68 stem cell scientist @entity66 , a woman could still bank stem cells from her milk and use them to help in the treatment of a disease such as diabetes later in life			1
insurance : a woman could bank the stem cells from her milk and use them to treat illnesses she might contract later in life for instance , a woman could bank the stem cells from her milk and then use them to help in the treatment of a disease such as diabetes later in life			1
embryonic stem cell research suffered a major set - back earlier this week when the first company to test them in people withdrew from the field			0
@entity94 biotech company @entity93 hoped the revolutionary therapy would help the paralysed walk again			0
the trial on men and women with spinal cord injuries caused by car crashes and sporting accidents was hailed as ' the beginning of a new chapter in medical therapeutics '			0
but after treating just four patients , @entity93 shelved the work , blaming the high costs and red tape of stem cell research as well as ' uncertain economic conditions '			0
however , others questioned whether it would have given up on the treatment if it really was going to produce the miracles promised			0
@entity93 , which now intends to focus on cancer drugs , has not released any information about how well the treatment worked			0
@entity120 's first embryonic stem cell trial is due to start later this year when a jab to cure blindness is tested at @entity124 's @entity123 .			0

embryonic stem cells could revolutionise treatment of cancer , blindness , diabetes , @entity32 ’s and paralysis
breast milk cells can turn into cells of the bone , cartilage , fat , brain , liver and pancreas
