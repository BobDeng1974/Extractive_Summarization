@entity0 had a good game in very difficult circumstances and over the 90 minutes , to the independent eye , did nothing to add to @entity6 â€™s claims of a campaign against his team			2
sure enough some referees would have waved away appeals for the penalty which @entity0 awarded against @entity12 , but replays confirmed what i thought when agreeing that the midfielder had caught @entity17 before playing the ball			2
there were some referees who would have given the home side a penalty of their own when @entity23 was challenged by @entity24			0
referee @entity0 ( right ) had some tough calls to make in @entity27 's draw with @entity28 some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to @entity28 , as @entity12 brings down @entity17 , but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball @entity27 striker @entity23 appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by @entity0 replays were inconclusive but pundits felt @entity0 was correct			1
had he awarded the penalty of course @entity24 would have had to be dismissed			0
the one decision i had to disagree with was when @entity12 cynically tripped his opponent and @entity0 , after due consideration and perhaps realising that @entity12 was already on a caution , decided to keep his cards in his pocket			0
@entity6 wisely subbed @entity12 shortly afterwards			0
@entity27 could also point to a trip by @entity48 on @entity49 just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which @entity0 did well not to caution			1
@entity49 went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from @entity48 but it would have been tough to give @entity23 claims he was fouled by @entity61 - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off @entity6 claims a campaign against his side but @entity0 's performance did nothing to support his theory			1

@entity27 drew 1 - 1 with @entity28 at @entity70 on *sunday*
referee @entity0 performed well in tough circumstances
penalty shouts for and against @entity27 were tight but fair calls
