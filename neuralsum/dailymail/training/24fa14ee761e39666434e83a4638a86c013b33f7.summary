an unmanned @entity1 rocket lifted off from @entity2 on saturday carrying a @entity4 satellite to measure how much water is in @entity7 's soil , information that will help weather forecasting and tracking of global climate change			1
the tiny amount of soil moisture links the planet 's overall environmental systems - its water , energy and carbon cycles - as well as determines whether particular regions are afflicted with drought or flooding			0
' it 's the metabolism of the system , ' @entity4 's @entity22 ( @entity22 ) observatory lead scientist @entity23 said before the rocket blasted off			0
the launch had been delayed a day by high winds and a second day to make minor repairs on the rocket 's insulation			0
perched on top on the rocket was @entity4 's 2,100 - pound ( 950 kg ) @entity22 , which will spend at least three years measuring the amount of water in the top two inches of @entity7 's soil			1
the 127 - foot ( 39 meter ) rocket , built and flown by @entity44 , blasted off from @entity46 , located on @entity2 's central coast the satellite will be @entity4 's first designed to collect global observations of @entity7 's surface soil moisture and the planet 's freeze and thaw state the data will be used to enhance scientists ' understanding of the processes that link @entity7 's water , energy and carbon cycles overall , soil moisture accounts for less than one percent of the planet 's total water reservoir , with 97 percent in the planet 's oceans and nearly all of the rest locked in ice , said @entity23 , from the @entity79			1
currently , scientists rely largely on computer models to account for soil moisture			0
but from its orbital perch 426 miles ( 685 km ) above @entity7 , @entity22 has two microwave instruments to collect actual soil moisture measurements everywhere on @entity7 and update the measurements every two - to - three days			2
including the launch and three years of operations , the mission is costing @entity4 $ 916 million			1

@entity7 - observing satellite will measure how much water is in our soil
@entity115 ( @entity22 ) will spend three years in orbit
launch of the 127 - foot ( 39 meter ) rocket had been delayed for two days
total cost of launch and three years of operations is $ 916 million .
