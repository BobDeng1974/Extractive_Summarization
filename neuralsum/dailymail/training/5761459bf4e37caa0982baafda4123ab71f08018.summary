by @entity0 paramedic @entity1 has been found guilty of misconduct after swearing at a patient last may a paramedic has been found guilty of misconduct after he told a patient to ' shut the f * * k up ' before leaving him in the back of an ambulance			1
@entity1 , 64 , launched the tirade of abuse at a 25 - year - old man who had dialled 999 complaining of crippling stomach pains			1
he then stormed out of the ambulance and was later found a mile away by shocked colleagues , a disciplinary hearing has heard			0
@entity1 , who worked for @entity16 for 30 years , has now been found guilty of misconduct			2
he quit the ambulance service shortly after the complaint was made against him in may last year			1
but , despite the finding , @entity1 has been allowed to continue working in his new job at a private ambulance firm because a watchdog found he does not pose a risk to patients			1
during a hearing at the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) in @entity29 , the paramedic said he was diabetic and was feeling unwell during the incident in may last year			1
a panel of experts decided the paramedic 's behaviour towards the man , called @entity36 at the hearing , was ' inexplicable ' and did amount to misconduct			1
in a written ruling , the @entity38 and @entity39 said : ' by his own account , mr @entity1 became very frustrated with @entity36 and told him to " shut the f * * k up "			0
' mr @entity1 left the ambulance , leaving ( another paramedic ) to deal with and treat @entity46 ' his behaviour fell well below the standards of behaviour expected of a registered paramedic and amounts to misconduct			1
' his decision to walk away was irresponsible and put patient a at risk of potential harm			0
his medical condition is not regarded as either an excuse for , or a cause of , his misconduct			2
' @entity61 , presenting the case for the @entity28 , said @entity1 and fellow paramedic @entity62 responded to a 999 call from the man , who was complaining of stomach pains on may 5 last year			1
she said the row erupted when the patient stopped answering @entity69 's questions and said he ' did not like his tone and attitude '			1
file photo she added : ' mr @entity1 said words to the effect of " that is it , i have had enough , i 'm off " and exited the vehicle closing the door			0
' after he was tracked down by colleagues , he eventually returned to the ambulance and apologised for his behaviour			0
the patient made a formal complaint when he reached the hospital and also alleged that @entity1 attempted to physically remove him from the ambulance during the incident			1
the paramedic always denied this , insisting he was removing a blood pressure monitor , and the panel found the patient 's claims were not proved			0
it was also alleged that @entity1 took the keys to the ambulance 's drug safe when he walked off , meaning the patient could not be given further pain relief			1
@entity102 told a standards panel he was feeling unwell at the time of the row the panel also found that this claim could not be proved as no one was sure where the keys were at the time			1
@entity1 , who has type ii diabetes , said his blood sugar was low on the day of the row and he had a headache			2
he said he has been assaulted and abused by people he was trying to help in the past but had never retaliated			0
the panel accepted that the low blood sugar was a contributing factor to his ' loss of control ' but was no excuse for his actions			2
@entity125 , from @entity126 , @entity127 , had retired from the service in november 2011 but returned to work in december 2012 , shortly before the incident the hearing was told that , since resigning last year , he has begun working for a private ambulance firm and now works transferring patients to and from hospital and assists at sporting events			1
despite the finding of misconduct , he was allowed to remain a registered paramedic after the panel decided he was not a significant risk to patients in his new role			0
the ruling stated : ' @entity143 considers that mr @entity1 has demonstrated insight into his misconduct			0
he has taken appropriate steps to ensure , so far as it is possible to do so , that the misconduct will not be repeated			0
' it added : ' he is better able to control his blood sugar levels since his current employer permits him to take food and drink with him on duty and the intensity of his workload is reduced meaning that he is less often required to work for long periods without a break			0
' after the hearing , a spokeswoman for @entity16 said : ' @entity16 can confirm that @entity159 was employed by the @entity160 when the incident occurred			0
' mr @entity1 resigned from his role with the @entity160 shortly after the incident and that resignation was accepted with immediate effect			2
' mr @entity1 has n't been an employee of the trust since late may 2013			0
' @entity167 always expects the highest level of care and professionalism from its staff and unfortunately that was not the case on this occasion			0
' @entity16 , whose @entity175 in @entity126 , said @entity1 resigned after the incident			2

@entity1 shouted at patient who was complaining of stomach pain
the 64 - year - old then stormed off and left the man in back of ambulance
he resigned from the ambulance service after the incident in may last year
standards body finds his ' inexplicable ' actions amounted to misconduct
@entity196 said he is a diabetic and was feeling unwell when row erupted
but panel finds condition was neither ' excuse nor cause of his misconduct '
despite the finding , he can keep his job working for private ambulance firm
