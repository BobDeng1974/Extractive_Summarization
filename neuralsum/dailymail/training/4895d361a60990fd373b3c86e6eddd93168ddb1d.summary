by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 16 april 2013 @entity1 , 23 , has been jailed for nine years for the rape of a 14 - year - old in @entity4 last august a judge has slammed police and prosecutors after a serial sex offender raped a 14 - year - old girl just ten days after being freed on bail for another rape			1
@entity1 , 23 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , was jailed for nine years today after admitting dragging the schoolgirl into woods and attacking her last august			1
but judge @entity17 said the victim and her family are entitled to ' an explanation ' after it emerged @entity22 was free on bail at the time , despite being arrested for the rape of a 42 - year - old woman ten days earlier			1
@entity25 in @entity4 also heard that @entity1 had a history of violent and sexual offences against females stretching back to 2009 including an attack on a 10 - year - old girl			1
judge @entity17 said : ' in my judgement both the victims and their families are entitled to as full an explanation of the matters which led to the defendant being at liberty and able to commit some of the offences			1
' i would suggest the @entity41 and police should offer to provide the explanation in person if they so request it			1
' the court heard how in august last year @entity1 had initially attempted to abduct a 13 - year - old girl in the village of @entity48 near mold in @entity50 but he stopped when a friend arrived			1
a short time later he conned the 14 - year - old victim into showing him the way to find a pub before dragging her into woods , threatening to kill her then raping her			1
during the horrific ordeal the terrified girl managed to send a message to her sister 's @entity61 page via her mobile phone saying ' help ' and ' raping me '			0
her family frantically set out to find her and the victim could hear them calling her name as she was being attacked			0
the victim 's mother eventually found the girl after she escaped and got back to the road			0
' it 's impossible to avoid the conclusion the psychological scars of what you did to her will remain with her for the rest of her life , ' he told @entity1			2
at an earlier hearing , @entity1 was convicted by a jury of attempting to rape a 20 - year - old woman in her bedroom at @entity12 , @entity13 , in june 2009			1
sexual predator : @entity1 had a history of offences against females stretching back to 2009 at the time the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) decided not to charge him because the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction			1
in december 2011 , @entity1 was jailed for six months after grabbing a ten - year - old girl in @entity95			1
the attack on the 14 - year - old girl took place in @entity48 in @entity4 the victim had told @entity101 police at the time she knew @entity1 wanted to take her somewhere and ' do stuff '			1
but despite her evidence he was only charged with common assault			0
as part of the current proceedings , he was convicted of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence			0
@entity1 was also found guilty of raping a 42 - year - old woman in @entity112 in august last year			1
judge @entity17 remarked : ' the third time he commits a serious sexual offence and the police and @entity41 do n't bring all the threads together and realise how dangerous he is			1
' the judge said the bail decision puzzled him			2
' there 's no explanation why the police and @entity41 could n't have understood the danger this man presented			1
in the absence of a full explanation , which i have no doubt will be subject of a full inquiry , i find it difficult to express a view because i do n't have all the information			0
' last night detective chief inspector @entity133 of @entity101 police said : ' a full review of the rationale and decision making surrounding the decision to grant @entity22 police bail has been conducted by the @entity140			2
' in any criminal case , the decision to charge with an offence , and to give consideration to removing an individual 's entitlement to bail is based upon the evidence pertaining to the offence for which the suspect has been arrested			0
' the decision to charge for serious offences must be reviewed by the @entity41 and only when the evidence is deemed strong enough will authorisation to charge be granted			2
until this point , the suspect 's entitlement to bail would remain and there is no ability to introduce further bad character evidence at this stage			0
judge @entity161 : ' there 's no explanation why the police and @entity41 could n't have understood the danger this man presented			1
' ' the circumstances of @entity1 's arrest in @entity101 , in 2012 , was the suspicion of the rape of a 42 - year - old woman			1
these circumstances were quite different to that of the other offences of which he was suspected			0
' ensuring that offences of rape are dealt with in an effective , yet compassionate , manner is a priority for @entity179			0
rape and sexual assaults are amongst the most traumatic of crimes			0
we want victims to be assured that we are here to help			0
' anyone who has been subjected to this type of crime should feel confident that they will receive the support they need from the @entity191 and other support agencies we work alongside			0
foremost , any victim of a crime such as this will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve , and any allegations will be thoroughly investigated and with the needs of the victim as our main priority			0
' justice : sexual predator @entity1 was finally jailed for nine years at @entity25 today the @entity41 also defended its actions			1
@entity208 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity50 said : ' @entity1 is a highly dangerous individual who is guilty of a string of horrific and violent offences			2
it is right that he has received a significant custodial sentence			0
' he added : ' over the last few weeks i have reviewed the @entity41 involvement in this case so that i can be assured that we have acted in accordance with our obligations under the @entity219 at all times			2
' the cps was first asked to provide advice to police on an allegation of attempted rape against @entity208 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity50 , said : ' some of the offences that individually may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction , became stronger cases when looked at together			2
at that time , a decision not to charge was taken on the grounds that the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction			0
this was mainly because the victim was unable to identify the suspect with sufficient clarity			0
at that stage , this was the only allegation relating to @entity22			0
' in december 2011 @entity1 was successfully convicted of common assault on a child in @entity112			2
' in august 2012 @entity22 raped a woman in @entity244 , @entity101			2
police were still investigating this incident when @entity1 committed his terrible crimes in @entity48 less than two weeks later			2
the @entity244 incident was not referred to the @entity41 by police until after @entity48 attacks had occurred			1
' once @entity101 police referred a file on the @entity244 rape to the @entity41 , it was considered alongside the files on the @entity48 incidents			1
all matters were immediately dealt with holistically			0
' some of the offences that individually may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction , became stronger cases when looked at together			0
as a result , @entity1 was charged with all offences , including the attempted rape in 2009			2
a further charge of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence was added , in relation to the @entity112 common assault			0
' i am satisfied that the @entity41 considered all allegations against @entity1 in the correct manner , as soon as the evidential files relating to these horrific offences were passed to us			1
by doing so , the prosecuting authorities ensured that successful prosecution of all the offences was possible			0

@entity1 jailed for nine years at @entity25 today
had history of attacks on females stretching back three years
given bail following arrest for rape of 42 - year - old in august last year
ten days later dragged 14 - year - old into woods and raped her
judge : ' victims and families entitled to an explanation from police and @entity41 '
