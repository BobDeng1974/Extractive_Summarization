@entity0 can be the future of @entity3 ’s midfield , but his injury record could turn him into another @entity5 , fears club legend @entity6			1
@entity0 was on the bench against @entity8 at @entity9 on saturday after five months out through injury			1
and @entity6 believes that the 23 - year - old ’s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential			1
@entity0 , on the bench next to @entity15 and @entity16 , for @entity3 's match against @entity8 @entity0 , the @entity18 international , is pictured in training for @entity3 earlier this month ‘ i think he ’s the future of the club , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i think if he stays fit , he ’s a quality player , there ’s no doubt about that			0
‘ the way he goes past players , the way he links up with people , i definitely think he ’s got a big role to play			0
‘ but again , the big question mark is can he stay fit ? look at @entity5			2
@entity5 ’s a terrific player			2
but look at him , the injuries the last few years			0
‘ the big burning question is can @entity0 have a full season without being injured for a long period , like he has n’t had for the last three or four seasons			1
’ the 23 - year - old pictured in action for @entity3 's under - 21s against @entity8 at the @entity42 earlier in april @entity0 is at the heart of a core of players at the @entity42 which has now reached the @entity48 final for the second year in a row , and are approaching maturity as a group			1
and although the @entity53 title may be out of their reach , @entity6 believes that @entity58 ’s squad , with the right additions , could be ready to finally push for top honours again			1
‘ what i like about the squad is that they ’ve got good youngsters - @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 - coming through , but the main nucleus of players are a good age , ' added @entity6 , talking at the @entity71 ’s pundit final			2
‘ they ’re not too old , they ’re in their prime now , they ’ve got the experience			0
so those sort of players , people like @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity0 if he ’s fit , they ’ve got that nucleus			2
@entity6 , who won three championships with @entity3 , has backed @entity0 to be the future of the club ‘ it ’ll need a couple of big signings , but if they can get them , i ’m sure they ’ll be a lot closer to @entity95 next season in the @entity53 , and in the @entity98 they can go the extra couple of rounds and get to the final , ' said @entity6 , at the @entity103 stage of @entity105 's pundit , championed by @entity71 – the @entity104 of the @entity18 team and the @entity53			1
after months of scouring the country , @entity104 has narrowed down its search to five football fans in with a chance of winning their big break on @entity113 on the last day of the @entity53 season			0
those five – a call centre worker , a personal trainer , a sales director , a production runner , and a furniture upholsterer – were put through their paces under the famous @entity9 arch by punditry legends @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity6 in the final race to see who will become @entity104			2
@entity6 , who won three @entity128 under @entity58 , was also full of praise of the @entity130 ' @entity48 final opponents @entity131 , and their boss @entity133			1
the former @entity135 boss – who grew up an @entity3 fan – has steered @entity131 away from the relegation dogfight and into their first cup final for 15 years , and @entity6 backed him to be named manager of the season if he triumphs at @entity9			1
@entity6 won the @entity48 under @entity58 three times , including in 2002 when he scored a stunning goal @entity144 @entity5 's promising career has been hit by a host of injuries ‘ i played with him at @entity18 , he always a great lad , always had a good football brain on him , and he ’s certainly delivering the goods at the moment , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ he ’s certainly got something going for him , and i ’d be amazed if @entity131 do go down , with the momentum they ’ve got			0
‘ if he can keep the club up and lead them next season in the @entity53 , and if he can win the @entity48 as well , it ’s a great season			0
if they can come fourth from bottom this season , and win the cup , he ’s got to be near enough for manager of the year			0
’ the @entity160 is all about making football better for fans			0
that 's why if @entity71 did pundits , they 'd probably be fans just like you			0
to find out more about the @entity168 's pundit finalists , vote for your favourite , and find out which will win their big break on @entity113 on the last day of the @entity53 season , head to @entity176 # @entity175			0
@entity71 is the official beer of the @entity18 team and the @entity53 .			0
