by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 07:32 est , 14 august 2013 a baby boy has made a miraculous recovery after being born with a giant cyst so large that it looked like he had two heads			1
@entity7 was born perfectly healthy apart from the 13cm cyst on the side of his neck			1
the growth was so large that his concerned mother , @entity12 , 20 , initially believed her baby had been born with two heads			1
@entity7 has made an amazing recovery after being born with a 13cm cyst on his neck			1
the growth was so big that his mother , @entity12 , initially thought he had two heads but thankfully , after five operations , doctors have finally been able to remove the growth which was causing @entity7 to suffer from back and neck problems			1
the 15 - week - old is now back at home in @entity24 , @entity25 , with his family			1
‘ as soon as i 'd given birth to @entity7 i closed my eyes in relief , i was so pleased i 'd got him out , ’ said ms @entity12			1
‘ but when i opened my eyes as they handed me to him i was so shocked - i thought he 'd been born with two heads			2
‘ i had no idea what it was - whether it was cancer or a tumour or something he 'd have forever , it was really scary			0
‘ i was so overwhelmed with love for him , i was n't worried about how it looked , i just wanted my baby to be ok			0
@entity7 ( pictured with his mother @entity44 , 20 ) was experiencing back and neck problems because of the cyst			1
he has undergone five operations to remove it ‘ i just feel so lucky that the doctors were able to remove it			1
@entity7 's neck looks amazing now - you 'd never have known what was there before			1
’ doctors were initially concerned that @entity7 's growth may be something sinister , but ms @entity12 was relieved when she was told that the cyst was purely cosmetic			1
@entity7 had been born with a lymphatic malformation - a collection of fluid - filled sacs , called cysts , that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system - the system meant to drain fluid from tissues			1
the sacks , which can leak causing growths to increase in size , occur when the lymph vessels fail to form correctly during the first few weeks of pregnancy			2
ms @entity12 said : ' i was so overwhelmed with love for him , i was n't worried about how it looked , i just wanted my baby to be ok ' ‘ as soon as the midwives saw @entity7 's lump they pressed a buzzer and within about 30 seconds 20 doctors were in the room , ’ said ms @entity12			1
‘ they were checking around the growth and putting things down his throat to see if he was breathing			0
‘ then he was whisked to the special care baby unit and there was about an hour and a half when i did n't even know if he was alive			0
‘ he had an ultrasound scan the next morning and i was relieved when the doctors eventually told us that @entity7 had a lymphatic malformation and that it was just a cosmetic problem			1
doctors were initially concerned that @entity7 's growth may be something sinister , but ms @entity12 was relieved when she was told that the cyst was purely cosmetic ‘ we were discharged from hospital and given an outpatient appointment three weeks later to discuss his treatment			1
‘ we 're really lucky because if they 'd have used forceps or given me a c - section they could have cut into the growth and @entity7 could have bled to death			1
’ at the outpatient 's appointment , ms @entity12 was told that her son could be given an injection therapy to decrease the size of the cyst			0
disappointed with the news that it would not be removed completely , ms @entity12 received a second opinion from mr @entity117 , a consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at @entity121			0
@entity7 was born with a lymphatic malformation - a collection of fluid - filled sacs , called cysts , that result from a malformation in the lymphatic system ms @entity12 said : ‘ after our first appointment i was told that the cyst would never fully go away and i was just really worried that @entity7 would get bullied because it was so large			1
‘ i felt like his future looked very bleak and that @entity7 's life was going to be horrible			1
‘ the growth was starting to bend his back and i was just so concerned			0
‘ but when i got in touch with mr @entity117 he was amazing			0
he brought @entity138 in for a scan and then gave us the fantastic news that the cyst could be removed			2
’ ' as soon as the midwives saw @entity7 's lump they pressed a buzzer and within about 30 seconds 20 doctors were in the room , ' said ms @entity12 on the first of july @entity7 underwent his first surgery			2
‘ when @entity7 went for his operation it was the worst day of my life , ’ said ms @entity12			2
‘ watching the doctors put him to sleep was horrible - i just felt him slipping away , i was a mess			0
‘ he was in surgery for five hours and then i went up to see him in @entity158			0
@entity7 had an operation to remove the cyst but it kept swelling up so he had to return to surgery four times to have it drained			1
he has now been able to go home ‘ it was really weird at first to see him without the cyst			2
the cyst was part of my baby and that 's how i 'd carried him			0
‘ it was strange but it was amazing too			0
’ whilst the initial surgery was a success , @entity7 has since had to go through four more procedures			2

it was strange but it was amazing too ' ‘ we 're back at home now though and i just could n't be happier			0
‘ everyone at @entity121 has been great - especially mr @entity117			0
‘ @entity7 can finally start living his life			2
’ mr @entity117 , consultant ear nose and throat surgeon at @entity121 , said : ‘ this is a very uncommon condition and can happen anywhere in the body			0
‘ they vary from being very small to very large , and can either be made up of lots of small cysts or lots of large ones			0
@entity7 's cyst was removed by mr @entity117 at @entity121 on july 1 ‘ how you treat them varies from child to child			1
i always see the children together with specialist children 's radiologist , dr @entity205 , so that we can discuss with the parents what the relative advantages of surgery and injection treatment are			0
‘ in @entity7 's case , the cyst was very large but it did n't obstruct the airway so he was lucky			1
‘ we were able to operate and i 'm pleased with @entity7 's results			2
it 's important when you operate to avoid the nerves that affect things like smiling and facial expressions			0
‘ we always leave a little bit of extra skin to allow for contraction but eventually you 'll hardly see anything at all			0
‘ @entity7 has done extremely well			2

@entity7 was born healthy apart from the huge cyst
he has undergone five operations to have the growth removed
now 15 weeks old , he is recovering at home with his family
