@entity0 celebrates winning the @entity5 by spraying a hostess in the face with champagne the hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in @entity6 @entity24 , chief executive of @entity25 , a campaign on media sexism and ' sex object culture ' , said : ' the photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed , but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face , which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part			1
' if this if the case we think @entity0 should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future			1
for most people , it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it			0
' it is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it			0
that is something of which he should be aware			0
but instead , he appears to have abused her position			0
' it 's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour			0
' @entity0 's celebrations have led to criticism of the two - time world champion @entity0 controlled the contest in @entity6 to seal his second victory in three races this season @entity64 added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world			1
she said : ' motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves			0
we would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women			0
on @entity79 , @entity0 was described as a ' bully ' and ' disgusting '			1
another user simply said : ' man please stop spraying @entity82 on the @entity83			2
they do n't like it ' , while one outraged user said he was a ' scumbag - an embarrassment to @entity89 '			0
another wrote : ' have a bit more respect for the ladies please			0
spraying @entity82 in her face was out of order # child # idiot			1
' @entity0 sprays a hostess after winning the @entity98 @entity5 in @entity99 last may and one tweeted : ' shame on you @entity101 and @entity0 for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration # sexism			1
' it is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move			0
he celebrated in a similar fashion after winning @entity98 @entity5 last year , which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the driver 's standings			1
and although he lost the @entity120 @entity5 to teammate @entity121 , he did n't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess			1
the 30 - year - old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on @entity127 's talk show in 2013			2
but not everyone was offended by his behaviour			0
many found his actions amusing , while another said : ' i can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @ @entity138			2
. lighten up people ! ' @entity0 and his team - mate @entity121 had a spat when the @entity141 said his team - mate slowed him down @entity121 was unhappy as he felt that @entity0 backed him up into the reach of @entity144			2
