a prceless horde of artefacts has been recovered from the site of the first ancient naval battle ever discovered			2
the find - including helmets , weapons and ancient bronze battle rams - has been rescued from the seabed off the @entity9 coast where they had lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years			1
they are the remnants of @entity12 - the last clash from the first @entity14 - which pitted the @entity15 against their enemies the @entity17 and propelled the @entity15 to @entity19 - wide domination			1
turn back time : researchers study a rusted helmet that was discovered in the depths of the sea it looks a little battered ! the remnants of a battering ram were amongst the horde of artefacts found a tablewear jug ( left ) and amphora - bottle ( right ) were rescued from the seabed off the @entity9 coast where they had laid for more than 2,000 years experts say the finds - which were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea - represent the first ancient naval battle site ever discovered			1
@entity38 archaeologists hailed the find a ' major discovery ' and are now leading the efforts to survey every inch of the nautical battlefield			2
@entity44 , an underwater archaeologist at the @entity45 , has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship aptly titled @entity48 to survey the battlefield			2
he said : ' there has never been an ancient whole battle site discovered before , which is quite surprising when you consider how important sea power is in the @entity54			0
' it is a major discovery			0
this is the first major naval battle between the @entity15 and the @entity57			1
because the @entity15 won they were set on the road to @entity60 and control of the @entity54			1
' the historical significance is huge , but what is so important is that we are finding battle sites because of changes in underwater technology			0
' we are at the cusp of an exciting range of new discoveries			0
' the finds , including this anchor , were scattered over some five kilometres and submerged beneath up to 100 metres of sea @entity38 archaeologists hailed the find a ' major discovery ' and are now leading the efforts to comb the seabed for more on march 10th , @entity79 , the two ancient heavyweights clashed in a huge naval battle off the coast of @entity82			2
the two powers had been warring for more than 20 years , as the @entity15 battled for a foothold in the all - important @entity54 sea			1
while the @entity17 were much more powerful on the water , the cunning @entity15 lay in wait trapping the @entity88 and blocking off their sea route in a sudden victorious attack			1
up to 50 @entity92 ships were sunk in the bloody attack , killing up to 10,000 men			2
around 70 more ships were captured along with their crews , while the rest fled			2
a project to find the lost battlefield was set up 10 years ago by the @entity100 in @entity101 and @entity102			0
but underwater mapping of the battlefield has just begun			0
the project has already uncovered some prized artefacts			0
so far some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water , along with bronze helmets and armour			1
dr @entity44 has been using cutting edge technology aboard a ship to survey the ancient battlefield so far researchers aboard the ship have found some 11 bronze battering rams used by ships to pummel each other have been fished out of the water , along with bronze helmets and armour the @entity123 in 241 @entity79 was a naval battle fought between the fleets of @entity125 and the @entity126 during the @entity127			1
it was a victory for the @entity15 that would lead to their domination in the years to @entity130 lacked a fleet â€” the ships it had possessed had been destroyed in a previous battle			1
yet their enemies , the @entity125 forces , did little to capitalise on this , allowing @entity138 to restore its strength and build a new stronger fleet			2
when the @entity141 heard about this , they prepared their fleet for battle , and sailed to the @entity145			0
the @entity15 sailed out to meet them - but not before stripping their vessels of sails and masts to give them an advantage in rough sea conditions , by ramming into their enemy 's ships and destroying half of the fleet , the @entity15 won a decisive victory			1
it was the last battle in the @entity127 , which had raged for 20 years as the two powers fought for supremacy over the western @entity54			0
dr @entity44 said : ' prior to this project just three bronze rams were known to exist in the whole @entity54 , and now we have 11 , so it is a major change in terms of the amount of physical information we now have about this battle			1
' some scholars had thought that ships were no longer ramming each other and that the rams were just for show			1
' but we have found bits of the enemy ships in some of the rams so it 's very likely they were ramming each other			1
' experts plan to cast the rams and use them to reconstruct what the ancient ships would look like			1
archaeologists had spent years scouring the shallow waters off the island of @entity185 , just west of @entity82 , searching for the infamous battlefield			0
but they only finally discovered the site after hearing stories told by old @entity9 divers that ancient lead anchors were lying on the seabed , off the @entity192			1
professor of pre-history and @entity100 , professor @entity195 said : ' the stories these divers told led me to speculate where this battle might have taken place			0
' to prove my hypothesis i carried out a series of dives and discovered 50 anchors			0
local fishermen brought up a bronze helmet from the same area and together with the discovery of the first ram my hypothesis became theory			2
' the area is so rich in archaeological finds that experts believe it could take decades to fully survey and analyse the data from this site			0
the artefacts are now being analysed at the @entity45			0
dr @entity44 said : ' for the first time archaeologists have recovered finds in context from the site of an ancient naval battle			0
' we can now begin to say something about the fittings and equipment present on ancient warships and indeed what would have been taken into battle			0
' it 's exciting because we now have archaeological data to add to interpretations which were wholly based on iconographic representations and the ancient literary accounts			0
