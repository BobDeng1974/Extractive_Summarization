by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 12 february 2013 mr @entity1 ripped up his @entity2 after speaking to his family and lawyer a cancer patient said he was left feeling terrified after a hospital doctor issued him with a @entity2 order			1
@entity1 was being treated for cancer of the inner chest wall and a blood clot at the @entity11			1
during his stay a doctor approached him and told him he would n't be revived if he took a turn for the worse			1
the 69 - year - old said : ' i had reacted badly to chemotherapy and i also had a blood clot so they admitted me to hospital			1
' this doctor came to see me and informed me that i would n't be brought around again if anything happened			2
i would just be left			0
' mr @entity1 from @entity22 , said the doctor gave him a form prominently marked @entity2 and walked away			1
the former haulage boss said the experience had really frightened him			0
he said : ' he terrified me , to be truthful			0
it is bad craic for something like that to happen when you are that ill. ' it is stamped all over with @entity2			2
apparently , you are supposed to carry it round with you			0
' mr @entity1 was also concerned that the matter was raised with him without any other member of his family being present			1
a few days later mr @entity1 was discharged and allowed home where he discussed the @entity2 order with his family			1
he was so concerned that mr @entity1 decided to raise the matter with his solicitor			2
he said : ' i talked to my solicitor and asked him , could they do that ? he told me they ca n't			2
' after taking legal advice mr @entity1 contacted the hospital , confirmed that he did not wish the order to apply to him and then tore up the document			1
despite the shock of being issued with a @entity2 order , mr @entity1 has nothing but praise for hospital staff			1
' i have no complaints about the medical care			0
it could n't have been better			0
' the widowed grandfather , who has two grown - up daughters , has decided not to have any more treatment for his cancer for the time being			0
but last night he joked : ' i have every intention of living as long as possible			0
i have just bought a new car ! ' the @entity11 where the order was issued do not resuscitate , or @entity2 orders are increasingly being used in the @entity68 when it is thought that the benefits of resuscitation are outweighed by the negative effects			1
the presence of a @entity2 order on a patients file means that medical staff are not required to resuscitate a patient if their heart stops or if they stop breathing			1
@entity78 , chief executive of @entity79 , said : ' the use of @entity2 orders is understandably a sensitive and deeply distressing issue			2
' sadly , there have been far too many cases where healthcare professionals have failed to facilitate proper conversations with relatives and patients about how , when and why a @entity2 order may be used			1
' hospitals need to look carefully at their procedures to ensure there are open discussions around end of life care involving both patients and relatives			0
' guidelines from the @entity98 state that @entity2 orders should only be issued after discussion with patients or their family			2
a spokesman for @entity22 and @entity103 said : ' we are sorry to hear about this complaint , and would welcome contact via the @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , and the opportunity to meet with the complainant to discuss their concerns			0
' resuscitation decision making is a complex process			0
@entity22 and @entity103 has a comprehensive policy that describes the process that we expect staff to follow when supporting patients and their families during this difficult time			0
this policy is based upon regional best practice			0
