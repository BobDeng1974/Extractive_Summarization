the @entity56 is a @entity28 - era main battle tank first built in the early 1960s			0
the @entity57 was introduced in the 1970s and went on to become one of the most widely produced tanks of the @entity64			0
the @entity59 entered service alongside the @entity57 in 1976 and was the first production tank to be equipped with a gas turbine engine for main propulsion			0

desolate : once a thriving tank repair plant , the depot has since become redundant , meaning the once - deadly vehicles are now abandoned photographer @entity18 said : ' it took me many months to track down this place , i had heard about it from a friend and decided it would be a great place to take pictures ' luck : the area around the plant is heavily guarded but mr @entity18 says he did n't see anyone when he got there			1

' during its prime in the 1960s and 70s , the @entity14 plant repaired more than 60 tanks and 55 engines per month			2
following the fall of the @entity49 in 1991 , however , many of the tanks on the site were left to rot as the newly independent @entity3 did n't have the money or desire to fix or modernise old machines			0
