' ' as a community , we are sensitive to the emotions and feelings of all of those who have suffered losses and are still grieving			0

@entity106 , who started a local chapter of one million moms for @entity109 just three days after the tragedy , told the @entity111 : ' we just felt it was too soon - it was only three weeks ago that the shooting happened and the @entity7 community is still grieving and state of @entity16 are still dealing with what happened			2

' closing the gun show ? how is that going to help anyone that was hurt in that episode ? ' gun shows - akin to a fair , where guns are on sale outside the normal confines of a gun shop - have come under scrutiny for so - called loopholes that sometimes allow sales without subjecting purchasers to a background check			1
