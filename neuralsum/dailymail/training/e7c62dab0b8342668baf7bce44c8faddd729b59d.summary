amid a swell of controversy , backlash , confusion and threats , @entity0 released @entity6 online on wednesday — an unprecedented counterstroke against the hackers who spoiled the @entity10 opening of the comedy depicting the assassination of @entity14 leader @entity13			1
' it has always been @entity0 's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film , ' @entity0 chair and ceo @entity15 said in a statement			1
' we chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day , and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release			1
the wide digital release is the culmination of a set of deals that have been in the works since the major theater chains last week dropped the movie that was to have opened on up to 3,000 screens			0
@entity55 , who stars in the film he co-directed with @entity57 , cheered the decision			0
' i need to say that a comedy is best viewed in a theater full of people , so if you can , i 'd watch it like that			0
or call some friends over , ' he tweeted			0
' thanks @entity0 for making it happen			2
@entity67 , ' he wrote in another tweet			0
@entity69 added , ' @entity70 ! ! ! ! ! ! the interview is live ! ! ! ! ! ... thank you @entity73 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ' a photo mocking @entity14 's @entity75 has been sweeping social media in recent days along with the hashtag @entity78 ‬			1
' the photo shows the stoic and stern @entity13 with a full face of make - up			1
it has been splashed across @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , and urges individuals to share , retweet or regram , ' for no other reason than to piss off @entity14			1
' two tickets for @entity91 at the @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , after some changed its mind and released the comedy to independent movie theaters @entity55 took to @entity84 on wednesday to share his delight that the interview is now available online as well as getting a limited cinema run from @entity10 a @entity0 executive close to the matter said that there is concern over whether the company will recoup the $ 40 million cost of the film and the millions more spent on marketing , but that affordability and wide access were their main priorities			1
the executive also said more providers could sign on in the coming days and weeks and the option is still there for more theaters to show the film down the line			0
the executive said it remained an option for the major theater chains to show the film , and that @entity0 was working to repair the symbiotic relationship that has eroded in recent days			1
@entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 - who between them operate more than half of the country 's 40,000 cinemas - had announced last wednesday that they would n't be screening it			1
decisions by @entity136 and @entity42 to show the movie could open their sites to hacking			1
@entity42 reported technical problems with its @entity41 sign - in system on wednesday , though it was n't known whether it was the result of hacking			1
@entity0 's initial decision not to release the film was widely criticized , with president @entity146 one of the harshest critics			1
@entity150 officials have blamed @entity14 for the hacking , and @entity153 spokesman @entity152 said @entity146 welcomed the latest development			2
@entity55 's co-star @entity69 also took to social media to express his delight that the film has been released ' as the president made clear on friday , we do not live in a country where a foreign dictator can start imposing censorship here in the @entity150			1
with today 's announcements , people can now make their own choices about the film , and that 's how it should be , ' @entity164 said			2
@entity171 , a @entity14 diplomat to the @entity172 , condemned the release , calling the movie an ' unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader			2
' but @entity13 said @entity14 will likely limit its response to condemnation , with no ' physical reaction			1
' among the early viewers was 11 - year - old @entity184 of @entity182 had wanted to see the interview since seeing a preview earlier this year and had followed the news about @entity0 pulling the movie , then permitting its release			1
@entity184 's family purchased @entity6 from @entity41 for $ 14.99			2
' it 's pretty funny , ' @entity184 told @entity192 , laughing as he praised the chemistry of @entity55 and @entity69 and adding that he could understand why the @entity14 government would n't like it			2
' they make fun of @entity14 a lot			2
' the @entity6 will play in more than 300 @entity150 theaters as of @entity10 , after @entity0 reversed its decision to pull the film , after coming under criticism from president @entity146 and others for caving into pressure from @entity14 shut it down : the hack was an attempt to get @entity0 to cancel the release of their film @entity6 , which depicts the assassination of @entity13 @entity211 , an executive assistant who lives in @entity212 , paid $ 5.99 to rent the movie on @entity40 and was disappointed			1
a fan of @entity55 and @entity69 , she found @entity69 's character ' way over the top ' and thought the jokes ' were old and kept going on and on			0
' ' it was kind of a mess overall , ' said @entity222 , 42			0
' i was a little bummed because i was looking forward to seeing it			0
' the move to make the film available for rental and purchase before its theatrical release had never before been done with a mainstream film			0
studios have released smaller indie and foreign movies simultaneously in theaters and on digital platforms , but analysts said the situation with the interview left @entity0 little choice			1
' this is n't being done because @entity0 wants to do it regularly , but rather out of necessity prompted by the exhibitor boycott , ' said @entity244 analyst @entity243			2
party guy : the film also depicts @entity13 as a party animal and ladies man ' @entity0 is in a delicate situation here since they normally never go this route with a major film , but theater chains also know this is a unique back - against - the - wall situation , ' added @entity256 , editor of @entity257			1
while @entity256 said that interest would likely wane in january , for now , the curiosity and enthusiasm is still palpable			0
@entity261 , manager of the @entity262 in @entity263 , @entity264 , said he had received 32 calls from people interested in seeing the interview during the first 90 minutes the theater was open on @entity269			2
' i 'd be willing to bet we 're going to sell out , ' @entity261 said			0
the theater has four showings on @entity10 , and five each for friday and saturday nights			0
' people want to see it because they 've been told not to , ' he said			0
for some , the decision to show the film has n't been the smoothest process			0
@entity281 , assistant manager of the @entity282 in @entity283 , @entity284 , still is n't sure whether her theater will be able to show the movie on @entity10 — it has n't received it from the distributor yet			0
as a result , tickets have n't been on sale , but there have been several calls from customers who have expressed interested in seeing it			0
releasing the interview could potentially cause a response from the hackers , who called themselves the @entity301			0
there have been none of the embarrassing data leaks of @entity0 emails since the movie 's release was delayed			2
in a message last week to the studio , the hackers said @entity0 's data would be safe so long as the film was never distributed			1
@entity15 said the release represented the company 's commitment to free speech			0
' while we could n't have predicted the road this movie traveled to get to this moment , i 'm proud our fight was not for nothing and that cyber criminals were not able to silence us , ' he said .			0
