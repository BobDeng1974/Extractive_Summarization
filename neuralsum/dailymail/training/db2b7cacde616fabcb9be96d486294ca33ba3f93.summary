but i knew i had to give the baby a chance			2
' the doctors explained it was unclear what effect chemotherapy could have on her unborn child or how significant a strain a pregnancy could be on her already weakened body			1
with a tumour the size of a small football in her chest @entity50 began eight rounds of gruelling chemotherapy			1
she said : ' i had scan after scan to check on the baby and even though everything looked fine it was n’t until she was born and i saw her that i could believe she ’d be okay '			2
remarkably @entity20 , now four , was safely delivered by c - section at 34 weeks			1
her arrival was made even more special as mrs @entity10 and her husband @entity60 endured two tragedies trying to become parents			1

i just knew i would do whatever it took to get that child into the world			0
the rest was in @entity99 ’s hands			0
' she added : ' when she arrived she had more hair than me and was perfect			0
after nine months of fighting for her it was amazing to hear her cry			0
i just lay there and thought , ‘ my work is done ’ '			0
but the delivery took its toll			0
having lost a lot of blood @entity50 underwent an emergency full body scan which discovered the cancer had travelled around her body and she subsequently underwent more rounds of intensive chemotherapy			0
she also had a bone marrow transplant at the @entity119			0
' that was when i felt truly scared			0
i remember looking out at the hospital car park from my isolation room and thinking : is this the last thing i ’ll see before i die ? ’ ' but the treatment - she also underwent radiotherapy - was successful and she has been in remission for 30 months			2
meanwhile , her daughter has grown and continues to be a source of hope and pride			0
she said : ' at times it feels as if it ’s happened to someone else and i have to pinch myself to remember it ’s all been real			0
