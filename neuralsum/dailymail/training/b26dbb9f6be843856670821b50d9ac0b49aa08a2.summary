one night last november , when we arrived home from school , @entity0 and @entity1 told us that they had heard strange sounds from the area behind our garage			1
we put on our wellies and ran excitedly across the grass , past the chickens and the pond , to the back of the garden where daddy parks his car			1
balancing on top of the builders ' rubble and our old bikes was a pile of sparkly boxes			2
he 's the genuine article : @entity25 and @entity26 met the real @entity27 at his snowy home at the top of the planet there was a small one labelled ' @entity26 ' , a slightly bigger one labelled ' @entity25 ' , a bigger one still labelled ' @entity0 ' , and the biggest one of all labelled ' @entity1 '			1
we tore off the silver ribbon and bows and opened the boxes			2
each one contained a jumper with a picture on it			2
@entity26 and @entity1 had a snowman , @entity25 had a @entity42 and @entity0 had a sparkly penguin			1
in ours we also had a rolled up sheet of thick paper , tied with a red bow			2
@entity1 unrolled it and read what it said			2
written in swirly hand writing , like we 'd seen in old books , it said : @entity26 and @entity25 i hear from my robins that you have been very good this year			1
i 'd like you to come and meet me at the @entity57			1
your mummy and daddy can come too			2
it 's very cold , so i have asked my elves to send you some new jumpers to keep you warm			1
see you soon ! lots of @entity64 , @entity27 x for a moment we did n't quite understand			1
then @entity0 and @entity1 explained			2
we had been written to by the @entity68 , and he 'd posted us the boxes and the letter from his home at the @entity57			1
we 've both seen all the helpers who look like @entity27 that appear around town at @entity42			1
but this was the @entity76 , really inviting us to visit him in his real home at the real @entity57			1
and he 'd sent us new jumpers to keep us warm			1
we could n't believe how lucky we were			2
thank goodness we 'd been good ! a few weeks later @entity0 and @entity1 drove us to the airport in @entity83			2
@entity27 had sent a special plane to collect us and some other lucky children			1
we were worried it would take a very long time , but by the time we 'd watched a film and done some colouring we were there			2
when we arrived at the airport at the @entity57 we had to collect our suitcases , but before they arrived we spotted two elves with pointy ears who had been hiding under the place where the bags go round			1
jumpers required for big adventures : @entity25 and @entity26 with mum @entity102 and tv presenter dad @entity101 they were very naughty elves , because they kept tapping people on the back and then running away			1
it made us laugh a lot			2
all around the airport it was snowy			2
there was a man dressed in funny clothes that @entity0 said everyone would have worn here years ago			2
he had a pet reindeer			0
we gave it a carrot			0
it looked a bit like @entity120 from @entity121			0
in fact , everything looked frozen			0
we got on a coach that took us to the place we were staying			0
on the way , some different elves made us sing silly songs			0
after half an hour @entity0 and @entity1 said the songs were driving them mad			0
but we carried on singing			0
our hotel was made from wood			0
the room was really big and had a tv			0
there was a kitchen where @entity0 could cook our tea			0
the best thing was that the room had a balcony that was covered in snow that came up to our tummies			0
there were lots of other wooden hotels all around , and a place we went to for our breakfast			0
there was even a supermarket			0
we did n't think they would have a supermarket at the @entity57 - especially one that sold dvds			1
that night we went for a ride on special machines that could go through the snow			0
they were like the ones from @entity25 's @entity159			1
@entity1 drove one , and we snuggled under a blanket in another with @entity0			0
we went through the car park and out into the forest			0
eventually we arrived at a place where there was a bonfire and a man who gave us hot chocolate with marshmallows in it			0
the grown - ups said we had come to see the @entity173 , but someone had switched them off			0
the next day we got on another coach and went to a secret place in the forest			0
there were loads of fun things to do , like sledging , rides on a sleigh pulled by real reindeer , and a funny show starring the elves			0
but then we got into a special sledge that was pulled by an elf on a sort of motorbike for the snow			0
a bit different to a sleigh ride : a snowmobile ride in search of the @entity173 was also part of the holiday we went down a path through the trees to a clearing where there was a little wooden house			0
inside the house , sitting beside a roaring fire , was the @entity68			0
he looked the same as lots of other @entity207 we 'd seen , but his tummy was even bigger and his beard even longer and whiter than anyone else 's			0
somehow he knew our names , and he asked us what we wanted him to bring us on christmas night			0
he said we could take a picture and gave us an early @entity42 present			1
on the way home we heard @entity0 and @entity1 say that it had cost a lot , and that the food ' left a bit to be desired '			1
we did n't understand what they meant			0
@entity27 had invited us to come for free			1
and as for the food - it was better than eating snow , and the hotel was at the @entity57 , so the person cooking would have to find things to cook in the forest			1
and anyway , on christmas day we got exactly what we had asked @entity27 for , so it was worth it			1
i hope we get invited again this year , although @entity27 did say that there were a lot of children in the world that he wanted to invite , so it 's ok if we do n't as we 've already had our turn			1
and if any silly boys or girls at school say ' there 's no such thing as @entity27 ' , we will know they are fibbing , because we have met him			1
@entity27 's @entity243 ( @entity244 , 01483 791945 ) offers a range of holidays to @entity243			1
a three - day trip to the @entity249 village of @entity250 costs from Â£ 499 per person , including return flights , transfers , half - board accommodation , private family meeting with @entity27 and gifts for under - 13s , and a full day 's activities .			1

@entity25 and @entity260 , aged 6 and 4 , were ' invited ' to visit @entity27
they visited @entity42 at his home at the @entity57 ( well , @entity243 )
garish @entity42 jumpers were required ( well , it can be chilly that far north )
