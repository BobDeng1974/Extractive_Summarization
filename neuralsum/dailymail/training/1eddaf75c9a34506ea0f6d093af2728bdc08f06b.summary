in a private room at one of @entity6 ’s favourite @entity5 restaurants on thursday , @entity1 ’s head coach confirmed that @entity7 is to dine at the top table from now on			1
@entity6 was in the celebrity haunt , @entity9 ’s of @entity10 , chewing the fat over the darling of @entity14 football after 23 goals in a @entity17 shirt drew him to national attention			1
next month , when @entity6 names an @entity1 squad for a @entity23 qualifier against @entity24 at @entity25 on march 27 and a friendly in @entity27 four days later , @entity7 will be the signature dish			1
@entity17 striker @entity7 has bee in sublime form for @entity17 and is set to earn an @entity1 call up @entity1 ’s head coach said : ‘ is he worth a place in the squad now ? of course he is			1
‘ we bought a lot of young players in during my time			2
we had @entity36 in the last squad			2
‘ he ( @entity7 ) certainly deserves a place in the squad as much as , say , @entity36 did			1
‘ is he worthy of a place like @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 or whoever ? well , that ’s something he ’ll have to prove			2
‘ unless i give him a chance in the squad he ’ll never get a chance to prove that anyway			2
certainly , i like to think i do show a certain degree of loyalty to players who have been playing for a while and who i know i can trust			0
the 21 - year - old , seen scoring at @entity56 on tuesday , has scored 23 goals for @entity17 this season @entity7 celebrates scoring against @entity59 ( left ) with his performances impressing @entity6 ‘ but i also like to think that i ’m prepared to give someone a chance when he ’s really showing with his current form that he ’s worthy of a place with us			1
@entity66 started it with @entity7 at the end of his reign last year by putting him in the team and he did n’t do badly			1
‘ now @entity71 ( @entity72 ) has put him in and i ’m delighted for us , delighted for the lad as well because he looks like the sort of player who has had to work very hard for his success			0
it ’s not something that ’s come overnight , he ’s had to put in a lot of hard work			0
’ @entity6 also had praise for @entity83 , the @entity84 striker who continues to score goals for a team that has been deep in the relegation mire all season			1
@entity6 ( centre ) , watching @entity89 play @entity90 , will name his next @entity1 squad in march @entity84 striker @entity83 , who scored at @entity93 on wednesday , has also caught @entity6 's eye @entity83 , 22 , has scored nine times for @entity97 ’s team in his maiden season in the @entity99 and is expected to join @entity59 when his contract expires in may			1
@entity6 added : ‘ @entity83 has impressed me as well , when we had that get - together , when i was watching the @entity102 and he impressed me			2
i think we need to keep an eye on him			0
‘ @entity104 is now back from injury , that ’s good news for us			0
i am lucky at the moment , quite a few players have already started to make their mark			0
@entity111 is another one - i like the look of him as well			0
@entity113 is very young , but we have a lot of young players like that he would have to jump over			0
’ 21 - year - old @entity7 has now scored 13 @entity99 goals for @entity17 , including two against @entity118 there are hurdles for @entity36 to overcome after he was banned from driving for 12 months in january after pleading guilty to drink - driving on the @entity122 in @entity123 last year			1
@entity6 promoted the @entity125 striker into the senior squad in november , but he has been reprimanded by the increasingly powerful figure of the @entity129 ’s director of elite development , @entity128			1
the @entity1 head coach added : ‘ it ’s been dealt with			2
he has been reprimanded and as far as we are concerned the matter is closed			0
‘ it is up to him to put that behind him and show with his future behaviour that he has taken the reprimand on board			0
’ @entity6 also spoke about @entity138 after the @entity118 and @entity1 midfielder was pictured holding a shisha pipe in @entity5 on the night of the @entity141			1
@entity1 ’s head coach , like @entity118 manager @entity143 , insisted he had no issue with it and even admitted that he had smoked shisha in the past			2
@entity1 midfielder @entity138 is now back in full training with @entity118 after another injury setback @entity6 said : ‘ i thought tobacco was smoking and shisha pipes were water with flavour — well you are blowing in and you ’re blowing out			1
‘ as an ex-cigar smoker , when i tried shisha i thought it was a complete nonsense , i could n’t understand who would do it			0
‘ apart from a faint fruity taste in your mouth that was about the end of it			0
as far as i am concerned that is a club matter and @entity143 dealt with it very , very well			0
‘ if you are asking me , in an ideal world is that an ideal thing to happen ? of course it is n’t , but we do n’t live in an ideal world			0
