a pensioner who went into hospital and came home to find her possessions had been cleared out has criticised her son who she says ' did n't think i was going to make it '			1
@entity7 was admitted to hospital forcing her to leave her bungalow in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but the 92 - year - old 's family was under the impression she planned to sell the house and allowed charity @entity15 to clear it out			1
her beloved dog @entity17 was also taken to a local animal sanctuary and later re-homed			1
after returning to find the house empty , the great - grandmother has criticised the charity and her family			1
i ca n't believe he could be so cruel			0
' she added : ' they left me with nothing			2
all my furniture was gone , all my diaries , books , clothes , everything			0
the worst thing is that i ca n't get my dog back either			2
' she spoke about the incident after @entity15 offered her an ' insulting ' Â£ 1,000 compensation			1
she said : ' they did get me some of my furniture back , and i have been able to get more things from my friends , but i still feel like it 's not my home any more			2
' in my day i would have knocked the spots off anybody , but now i 'm absolutely demolished			0
' mrs @entity7 has lived alone since her @entity56 hero husband @entity55 passed away in 1991			1
the fiercely independent nonagenarian added : ' i loved my home - it had masses of memories			2
i 've got nothing now , not even my dog			2
' @entity32 made up his mind that selling my property was the thing to do , and he got rid of the furniture that was clogging up the place			0
i was left effectively having to start my life over again			0
' @entity7 says she was horrified when a charity cleared out her belongings without her permission she said she did not explicitly permit the organisation to remove her belongings and wanted them back			1
the pensioner is calling for a change in the law to make it more difficult for charities to act in such a way without the homeowner 's permission			0
' i 'm 92 - years - old and i 'm in a house which is almost empty , ' said mrs @entity7 told the @entity83 's @entity82			1
' all the work i 've done , all the knitting and sewing i 've done , all the things i 've made are gone			0
it 's just like i did n't exist , ' she added through tears			0
mrs @entity7 's son @entity32 insists she knew what was happening and he saved many of her things she said she was horrified the charity had carried out her son 's instruction without checking with her first			1
' i think they should be absolutely certain that the person who 's holding the key has the right to be doing what they 're doing			0
' her son , @entity103 , said his mother knew to expect her things would be cleared as they had made arrangements for her to move out of the home			1
' everything was done in negotiation with her , while she was in hospital i would visit with an @entity112 to show her the rooms and we negotiated what was going to be done , what would be kept and thrown out , ' mr @entity103 told @entity117			2
' she was going to move into a home temporarily and then she was going to move into a flat			0
' while she was in hospital i redecorated the house and she put it on the market but when she returned she decided she would rather stay			1
i did in fact save a lot of her things			0
' while mrs @entity7 was in care two years ago a driver from @entity15 visited the property to collect her things			1
the charity has apologised for her ordeal and said it had reviewed its procedures since			0
' we were advised that mrs @entity7 wanted to make a donation of furniture , small items and clothing , as she was moving into a nursing home and her property was to be sold , ' a spokesman told @entity117			1
when they learned she wanted her possessions back , @entity15 say they invited her to collect them			2
' mrs @entity7 attended our premises and took back the items she wanted			2
we feel we acted fairly in this situation and received donations in good faith at the request of her family member			0
' we have never had an incident like this before or since			0
however , since this incident we have reviewed our procedures to minimise this happening again			0
' the 92 - year - old said her home in @entity10 , @entity154 now feels empty with so few of her possessions left charities are legally able to remove the contents of an elderly person 's home without checking with them if they have been expressly told to do so by a relative			1
but critics say more should be done to protect the elderly and their assets			0
' we share ms @entity7 's outrage that her lifelong possessions have been stripped from her home without her permission , ' said @entity172 , chairman of @entity173 on @entity174			1
' this is yet another example of the sickening financial abuse that older people in the @entity178 face day in , day out			0

@entity7 was admitted to hospital for a short stint last year
the 92 - year - old returned home to find her belongings had been cleared
