president @entity0 admitted sunday that as the nation 's top @entity1 , he bears the blame for his party 's historic losses in tuesday 's midterm congressional elections – but insisted moments later that his policies are sound , and signaled that he will double down on his most controversial plans			1
' we got beat , ' @entity0 said during a wide - ranging @entity12 interview , acknowledging that his @entity14 - like approval ratings – in the high 30s according to some polls – handed @entity17 control of the @entity18			2
' whenever , as the head of the party , it does n't do well , i 've got to take responsibility for it , ' he told ' @entity26 ' anchor @entity25			0
' the message that i took from this election , and we 've seen this in a number of elections , successive elections , is people want to see this city work			0
and they feel as if it 's not working			0
' but in what seemed like the second half of the same breath , @entity0 took credit for handling the not - button @entity40 crisis , pledged to double - down on his plan for an intensely unpopular immigration policy shift , claimed that friday 's mini-troop - surge in @entity45 will put the @entity47 terror army on its heels and insisted that @entity50 's economy would be a shambles without him			1
' ' i have great confidence in the @entity50 people and i have great confidence in this administration being able to work through and eventually solve problems			1
sometimes we do n't do it at the speed that keeps up with , you know , the press cycle			0
he said his @entity79 has ' handled @entity40 well			1
' a @entity82 / @entity81 poll published six days ago found that @entity50 disagree			2
just 34 per cent ' told pollsters that they have faith in the president to handle the @entity40 crisis effectively , ' compared to 49 per cent who do n't			1
a 55 per cent majority said the administration has been ' slow to react ' to the crisis			0
@entity0 addressed his friday announcement that he gave the @entity93 permission to send an additional 1,500 ground troops into @entity45 – officially as advisers			1
they will supplement 1,400 already in the war theatre , and bring the total deployment authorization number to 3,100			0
that move , he said , ' signals a new phase ' in the fight against the self - proclaimed @entity102 , but he pledged that @entity50 servicemen and women wo n't find themselves taking or returning fire			1
a former senior @entity93 official told @entity82 on friday that such a claim is far - fetched , and noted that @entity50 's protracted and deadly war in @entity109 similarly began with promises that @entity50 troops would only be inserted as ' advisers ' to @entity114 military planners			1
' no one really believes the president and his advisers – and they 're some smart people – are n't already inserting @entity119 who are armed for combat , probably in both @entity45 and @entity122 , ' the former official said			1
but @entity0 told @entity25 that ' what has n't changed is our troops are not going to be engaged in combat			2
' it 's only ' @entity45 ground troops , ' he said , ' that can start pushing them back			1
' overall , @entity0 described his latest battle chess move as an effort to put @entity45 ' forces and @entity134 fighters on the other side of the ball for a change			1
' rather than just try to halt @entity102 's momentum , ' he explained , using his own preferred acronym for @entity47 , ' we 're now in a position to start going on some offense			1
' ' the airstrikes have been very effective in degrading @entity102 's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making			1
' with @entity57 reeling and @entity17 strutting after tuesday 's seismic power shift , @entity0 said sunday that he still wo n't back down from his threat to steamroll the @entity17 with an executive order changing the status of millions of illegal immigrants			1
on thursday house speaker @entity152 warned that if the president acts without the say - so of @entity156 , it would ' @entity153 ' for cooperation during @entity0 's last two years in office			1
@entity0 , though , framed the confrontation as if he held all the cards			2
@entity161 : ' rather than just try to halt @entity102 's momentum , ' @entity0 said , ' we 're now in a position to start going on some offense ' ' their time has n't run out , ' he said			1
' the minute they pass a bill that addresses the problems with immigration reform , i will sign it and it supersedes whatever actions i take			2
and i 'm encouraging them to do so			0
' but ' we 've got to sell it , ' he said of @entity57			2
' we 've got to reach out to the other side and , where possible , persuade			0
' @entity0 prefers a new ' comprehensive ' immigration law styled after the so - called ' @entity183 ' bill that passed last year in the @entity18 but was considered dead - on - arrival in the @entity79			1
if @entity0 somehow gets what he wants , he said , ' nobody 's going to be happier than me to sign it , because that means it will be permanent rather than temporary			1
' that 's an acknowledgement that whatever he does unilaterally could disappear if a @entity17 president were to take power in 2017 and undo it			2
overall , the president sounded more like a middle - manager than the most powerful politician in the world			0
' i think that what you 'll see ' in his last two years in office , he said , ' is a constant effort to improve the way we deliver service to customers			0
' and he spoke generously of his own political acumen – and of his abilities in @entity210 's perpetual arm - twisting games			0
' i love this job , ' @entity0 said			2
' if your name is @entity0 , you had to have liked politics in order to get into this office			2
... i got into politics because i believed i could make a difference , and i would not have been successful and would not be sitting at this desk every day if i did n't love politics			0
' he pointed to the 2010 passage of the @entity223 as an example , saying it required ' a whole bunch of arm twisting ' to get passed			0
@entity57 pushed the @entity223 law through @entity156 without a single @entity17 vote			1
and he 's @entity230 : @entity0 left for @entity231 on sunday to attend the @entity232 ( @entity232 ) @entity233 , where he can expect a confrontation with @entity236 president @entity235 on his foreign policy , @entity0 discussed his outreach to @entity239 generally but would n't comment on reports that he had written a personal letter to the @entity244 's @entity243 ayatollah @entity242			1
' i tend not to comment on any communications that i have with various leaders , ' he said			0
but he claimed ' significant ' progress negotiating with @entity239 over its dangerous nuclear ambitions that have already provoked alleged military responses from @entity251			0
ever the negotiator , @entity0 said ' the question now is are we going to be able to close this final gap so that they can reenter the international community , sanctions can be slowly reduced and we have verifiable , lock - tight assurances that they ca n't develop a nuclear weapon			2
' ' but there 's still a big gap , ' he conceded , ' we may not be able to get there			0
' he also acknowledged that @entity239 has troops stationed in and around @entity265 , inserting itself into the @entity45 conflict with @entity47			2
the majority - @entity267 @entity239 sees the terror army as an adversary because it is largely made up of @entity270			0
' we let them know , " do n't mess with us			0
we 're not here to mess with you			0
we 're focused on our common enemy , " @entity0 said			0
' but there is no coordination or common battle plan and there will not be			0

president says he 's to blame for @entity57 ' *massive* midterm losses but insists his economic record is solid and the @entity50 is better off with him in power
sticks to his guns on plan for immigration executive orders , but still wants @entity156 to pass ' permanent rather than temporary ' change
@entity0 says doubling number of ' advisers ' in @entity45 will allow for offense instead of ' just try *[* ing *]* to halt @entity102 's momentum '
says his administration has ' handled @entity40 well '
refers to @entity50 *taxpayers* as government ' customers '
