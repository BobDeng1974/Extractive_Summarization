claim : parents who beat their daughters said it was ' acceptable ' in their native @entity3 a mother and father who beat their young daughters with phone chargers and a wooden spoon told a judge it was ' acceptable ' in their native @entity3			1
the couple have been spared jail despite social workers uncovering the extent of the abuse on the children - who are all aged under eight - and taking them into care for their protection			1
instead the pair , who moved from @entity3 to @entity22 , were handed 180 hours of unpaid work each after they admitted three charges of child cruelty at @entity27			1
a judge heard they regularly hit their three daughters on the arms and legs , locked them in their rooms when they misbehaved and made one kneel with her hands in the air			1
the abuse went undiscovered until a routine interview at school between a social worker and the eldest girl , which was arranged because the family had arrived in @entity44 from another country			2
prosecutor @entity46 said the girl revealed she was regularly hit on the back with a phone charger wire , and her parents struck her with their hands on her arms and legs			2
the girl told social workers she was battered with a large spoon and locked in her room for long periods of when she misbehaved			0
' the child said she was also made to kneel with her hands in the air for a long period of time and then punished if she let them drop , ' the prosecutor added			1
but @entity61 , defending , said the charges had come about due to a cultural misunderstanding about ' appropriate chastisement ' in @entity44			0
he said : ' in my client 's home country children are punished like this and it is acceptable			1
' smack : the parents ' lawyers told @entity27 ( pictured ) that the punishment was appropriate hitting a child is always treated as a crime by police , but @entity44 law allows parents to use the defence of ' reasonable chastisement ' in court			2
that means the assault was proportionate to discipline the child - a defence which has been supported by prominent mps including justice secretary @entity87			0
he told the @entity89 in 2013 : ' i ’m not opposed to smacking			0
it is to be used occasionally			0
sometimes it sends a message – but i do n’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school			0
' however , all assaults on children that leave bruising , swelling , cuts or grazes have been illegal since the 2004 @entity101			0
any adult found guilty can face up to five years in jail			0
judge @entity105 ruled that the punishments dished out by the pair were unreasonable , but their behaviour had not been severe enough for them to be sent to jail			1
' you thought you were doing the right thing ; something that would happen in @entity3 , ' she said			2
' you thought it was appropriate chastisement			0
' judge @entity105 sentenced the man and woman to a community order including 180 hours of unpaid work			1
they were also given a three - month curfew from 7pm to 7am			0
the children involved have since been taken into temporary care , where they are living with foster carers and have supervised visits from their parents			1
it is believed the couple , who the law says must be kept anonymous to protect their children , will fight to regain custody in care proceedings later this month .			2

pair in @entity22 , from @entity3 , have three children under eight
they beat them and made one child kneel with her hands in the air
parents told a judge punishments were routine in their home country
daughters taken into temporary care and could be removed *permanently*
but parents were spared jail and instead handed 180 hours ' unpaid work
