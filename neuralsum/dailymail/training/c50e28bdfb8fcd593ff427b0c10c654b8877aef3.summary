while tattoos are a relatively recent phenomenon in @entity82 and the @entity83 , body art has long been part of polynesian culture and has also been found on the mummified remains of @entity88 priests and priestesses			0
although tattoos first made an appearance in the woad etchings of @entity93 , they did n't reappear in @entity95 culture until the 19th century and the first recorded body art craze which originated in @entity98 high society			1
popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to the @entity101 full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels , tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women			2

sadly , tattoos did n't equal control for many @entity98 women , some of whom were tattooed against their will and press - ganged into work as circus attractions			1
others became tattoo artists themselves , including @entity83 @entity162 , the first known woman tattooist , who in 1904 traded a date with her tattooist husband - to - be for an apprenticeship and @entity101 tattooist @entity166 who opened her @entity29 business in 1921			1
but while tattoos remained popular during the 1920s , their popularity waned in the wake of the @entity172 and the @entity173			0
left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years , the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s , when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement before becoming part of the body - conscious beautifying of the 1980s and then gaining mainstream status in the 1990s			0
