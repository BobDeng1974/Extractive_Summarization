by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:54 pm on 21st june 2011 @entity2 today said that he was baffled by controversy surrounding his claim that illegal immigrants caused some of the wildfires raging across @entity8			1
in a hastily arranged tour of the breakfast news shows , the @entity8 senator tried to explain his comments , saying all he was doing was repeating information he had been given by officials			1
' we all know that people who come across our border illegally … that these fire are sometimes , some of them , caused by this , ' he told the @entity22			2
' i 'm puzzled … that there should be any controversy			2
' this is the toughest year in @entity8 's history as far as fires are concerned , ' mr @entity2 told @entity41			1
' the fact is that as far back as 2006 the @entity37 testified before @entity45 , and i quote , “ large numbers of warming and cooking fires built and abandoned by cross border violators have caused wildfires that have destroyed valuable natural and cultural resources ”			1
' a spokesman for the agency said on monday that although the latest wildfires appeared to be ' human caused ' there is no evidence that the suspects were illegal immigrants			1
meanwhile mr @entity2 brushed aside questions about whether he might run for president again in 2012			1
asked on the @entity22 whether he would consider running if there were no clear front - runner , he smiled and said : ' there 's a long history of masochism in my family , but not so severe as to make me want to jump in again			1
' not running again : mr @entity2 insisted that he would not be running for the @entity68 nomination again after he ran for president with @entity70 in 2008 @entity68 senator @entity2 accusation that illegal immigrants started wildfires raging across @entity8 , prompting a furious response from @entity75 civil rights groups			1
he spoke as thousands more @entity8 residents were evacuated from the paths of the biggest wildfires ever in the state 's history			1
mr @entity2 had said : ' there is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally			1
' the answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border			2
' latino civil rights campaigners slammed the remarks , presented without any supporting evidence , as ' careless and reckless '			2
speaking to @entity98 , @entity96 , a @entity75 @entity97 who ran against mr @entity2 in 2010 , said : ' it 's easier to fan the flames of intolerance , especially in @entity8 '			1
tragic : @entity103 leans on his rake while at his home that burned along the south side of @entity108 near @entity109 92 fire crews from @entity111 and @entity112 mop up hot spots in a storage trailer in @entity115 , @entity8 , after the @entity116 burned through the area overnight firefighters are currently battling wildfires that have burned a combined 732,427 acres across the state			1
mr @entity2 had suggested that illegal immigrants had started the fires to send signals , to keep warm or to distract border security			1
but he did not pin down which fires were allegedly started by illegal immigrants , nor provide details of the ' substantial ' evidence he cited			1
meanwhile thousands more people were driven from their homes as powerful winds pushed the flames from one wildfire towards populated areas			2

the flames raced down a mountain and into a heavily populated area , forcing crews to abandon their lines and set up in new spots			0
sunday 's evacuations brought the total number to about 10,000 people from 4,300 homes forced to flee the flames of the @entity137 fire , she said			0

a containment line that had held through days of high winds was breached on saturday and the fire raced toward town before shifting winds steered it clear			0
it was moving to the north into an area of scattered ranches late on sunday afternoon , fire information officer @entity212 said			2
despite the evacuation order for @entity205 , about half the town 's residents remained in town			0
' if the fire comes back around or things change where they have to get out , we still have an egress point , so we will still escort them out of town , ' @entity222 undersheriff @entity221 said			0
the @entity231 blaze has consumed nearly 800 square miles , a little more than 511,000 acres , and more than 3,500 firefighters were trying to stop its advance			2
