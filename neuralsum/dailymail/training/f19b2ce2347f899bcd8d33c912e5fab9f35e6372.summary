by @entity1 reporter published : 07:16 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 20 december 2012 @entity3 singer @entity2 died in 2011 at the age of 27 famous solo artists are twice as likely to die prematurely as stars in bands , according to researchers from the @entity9			1
the new research , published by online journal @entity11 , suggests that solo performers in @entity14 have a one in ten chance of premature death – for @entity18 soloists the chance is one in five			1
the situation is much less dire for band members and researchers believe this could be due to support offered by fellow band mates			1
the researchers found that solo rock and pop artists from @entity25 have a 22.8 per cent increased risk of dying prematurely compared with a 10.2 per cent increased risk for band members			1
they said that @entity14 solo performers had a 9.8 per cent increased risk compared with a 5.4 per cent increased risk for band members			1
the researchers raised the question of whether support offered by band mates may be protective			1
‘ @entity35 and pop star survival seems to relate to whether they have pursued successful solo careers , ’ they wrote			2
‘ while this may simply be a proxy for level of fame , with solo performers often attracting more attention than , for instance , a drummer or keyboard player in a band , it also raises the issue of peer support as a protective factor			1
‘ thus , further research should address whether bands provide a mutual support mechanism that offers protective health effects			2
’ @entity56 , a psychologist who specialises in celebrity behaviour , also believes the support of a band may be protective			2
@entity2 died of alcohol poisoning in 2011 , aged 27 @entity61 died in february this year at the age of 48			0
she accidentally drowned in the bath due to effects of cocaine use and heart disease @entity67 died in 2009 at the age of 50			0
he had a heart attack while acutely intoxicated on propofol and benzodiazepine @entity72 died in 1970 at the age of 27			0
he is believed to have choked on his own vomit while on sedatives she told the @entity77 : ‘ solo artists in general approach life in a solitary manner - deliberately choosing to go it alone			1
‘ they can find themselves in a situation where everyone around them are paid employees - the pr guru , their manger - all interested in them from a financial point of view and not in their personal needs - it 's hard for the artist to know who to trust			0
‘ they travel a lot , are away from friends and family for long periods of time and only seen for their public image , not their real self - which can make them feel inferior , isolated and invalidated			0
' she added that , even for the general population , psychology research has found that people with support have increased lifespan - and those in a band may benefit even more from this - they are all in the same boat			2
in recent years there have been a number of high profile premature deaths among solo artists including @entity2 , @entity61 and @entity67			1
both @entity67 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) died prematurely			0
@entity67 died at the age of 50 and @entity61 at 48 the authors of the research examined data concerning 1,489 rock and pop stars who reached fame between 1956 and 2006			0
of these , 137 stars had died by the research cut - off point in february 2012			0
the average age of death was 45.2 for @entity18 stars and 39.6 for the @entity14 artists			1
the authors found that nearly half of those who died as a result of drugs , alcohol or violence had at least one adverse experience in their childhoods , compared with one in four of those dying of other causes			0
‘ adverse experiences in early life may leave some predisposed to health - damaging behaviours , with fame and extreme wealth providing greater opportunities to engage in risk - taking , ’ they said			2
‘ millions of youths wish to emulate their icons			0
it is important they recognise that substance use and risk - taking may be rooted in childhood adversity rather than seeing them as symbols of success			0

researchers claim soloists in @entity14 have a one in ten chance of premature death
solo artists in @entity25 have a one in five chance of early death
group members fare better *possibly* because of support from their band mates
