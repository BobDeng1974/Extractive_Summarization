' he ’s working with physios			2
we ’ll keep our fingers crossed , ' @entity4 said			2
' we wo n’t make a decision before we go to @entity23			2

' watching on : @entity26 watches the training session from the sidelines waiting game : @entity4 said he will wait until the last possible moment to give @entity5 a chance feeling the heat : the @entity12 players have a drink in the @entity36 sun during training keeping cool : @entity38 is sprayed down with water at training @entity4 added : ' we ’re working very hard and he ’s working hard			1
let ’s see and hope it ’s not too serious			2
' he ’s a positive character			2
it was a major blow			2
he ’s had a long period of inactivity and seeing him play well excited us all			2
so you can imagine how sad he is now he ’s on the sidelines but his mood is good			1
' @entity4 is banking on the midfielder being fit , stating it will be ' difficult ' finding a replacement if he is unable to prove his fitness			1

i ’m not here to disguise that			0

' but for all the young players ' bravado , question marks still remain over @entity61			0
despite being @entity12 's most talented player , the striker has not scored in his previous two @entity135 and pressure is mounting			1

' everyone ’s capable of playing in the starting 11			0
that ’s healthy and good			0

i ’ll look out for them			0
not only raheem because he ’s from @entity184			0
i spoke to @entity5 as well			1
it ’s not about 11 its about 23			0
