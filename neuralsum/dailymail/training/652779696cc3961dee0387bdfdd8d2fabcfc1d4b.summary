by @entity0 forget the search for life on @entity3			0
scientists want to know if it is possible to make chips in space			1
@entity9 researchers are to try to fry chips under type of reduced gravity found on @entity3 or the moon			0
they ’ve already shown it is possible to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity			1
@entity9 researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity the experiments are funded by the @entity26 and follow comments from a @entity29 cosmonaut that what he ’d really like is ‘ fried potatoes ’			1
researcher @entity32 began by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity , which is when the force of gravity is more than that on @entity40			1
he found that at a force of 3 - g , which is three times the gravity of @entity40 , the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time			2
while the chips may not have tasted out of this world , they tasted as good as those fried normally			0

here , astronauts eat a meal on board the @entity58 the professor , from the @entity60 , said the same effect could be achieved by creating an industrial fryer that spins once a second or a home fryer that rotates twice a second , and he plans to patent a design			0
in the meantime , experiments that recreate the weightlessness of space are planned			0
professor @entity32 suspects that the potatoes will boil rather than fry but said : ‘ it will be important to know whether we can fry on @entity3 or the moon			2
’ his experiments are described in the journal @entity77			0
