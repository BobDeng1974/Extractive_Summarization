by @entity0 @entity1 needs @entity2 to do @entity3 a huge favour after a 2 - 2 @entity5 draw with the @entity6 left his side teetering on the brink of early @entity10 elimination			1
the @entity3 would have been knocked out of the tournament by the @entity12 had substitute @entity13 not scored a last - gasp equaliser in @entity15 to keep @entity3 's faint hopes of progressing to the last 16 alive			1
@entity17 opened the scoring during the early exchanges at the @entity20 but goals from @entity22 and @entity12 captain @entity23 meant @entity13 was charged with forcing the draw to salvage a vital point			1
net gains : substitute @entity13 scored in injury time to salvage a 2 - 2 draw with the @entity6 on the ball : @entity3 head coach @entity1 @entity3 must now beat @entity30 in @entity31 while hoping group leaders @entity2 inflict a heavy defeat on the @entity12 , a defeat heavy enough to allow @entity1 's men to remedy their inferior goal difference and sneak into second place			1
@entity1 told @entity38 : ' it 's clearly not a good result for us			0
the 2 - 2 does n't put us out of the @entity10 mathematically , but it does leave us in a very difficult situation			1
' not just because of what we 'll need to do against @entity30 , but also because we 'll need a favourable result from the @entity2 - @entity6 game			1
' we were unlucky late in the first half , but it was a great effort to level the match ( in second - half stoppage time )			2
' now all we can do is to give everything in our very last game and try and make the most of the very little chance that we have left			0
' the @entity12 , who beat @entity30 2 - 1 last week , came so close to recording back - to - back wins but , despite admitting he was frustrated by sunday night 's result , @entity56 coach @entity55 hailed an ' extraordinary performance '			1
' when you concede a goal in the last second then it 's unlucky , ' he said			0
' our boys put in an extraordinary performance			0
' the journey 's now a little bit longer for us , but we want to beat @entity2 to confirm our place in the round of 16			2
end of the road : @entity72 are relying on other results to stand any chance of progressing ' i 'm a little frustrated with this draw , but we 're going to work hard to make sure this does n't happen again			0
' @entity79 goalkeeper @entity78 pulled off a series of fine saves to keep @entity3 at bay during their brighter periods			2
he said : ' we 're a little disappointed , but still optimistic			0
' we thought we 'd put one foot in the round of 16 , but we are where we 'd aimed to be before the tournament : going into the final game with a good chance of progressing			2
' the coaching staff put in place a great game plan			0
@entity3 did n't cause us too many problems and we could have avoided both their goals			2
' we moved the ball around better and had the clearer chances			0
we 're not going to let the last - gasp goal get us down			0
' on thursday the @entity12 meet @entity2 in @entity97 , where a draw will be enough to send both nations through to the knockout stages at the expense of @entity30 and @entity3 .			1

@entity3 were heading out of the tournament until late equaliser in 2 - 2 draw
@entity13 scored in injury time with @entity3 on brink of elimination
but @entity3 must now beat @entity30 and hope @entity2 inflict heavy defeat on @entity12 in final round of matches to progress to the last 16
