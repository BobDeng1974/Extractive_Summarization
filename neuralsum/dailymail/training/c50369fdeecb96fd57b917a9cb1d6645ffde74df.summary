@entity1 boss @entity0 says @entity2 deserves his new contract after finding a home at the @entity5			1
@entity2 represented eight different clubs before joining @entity1 in august 2011 and has since played a big part in the @entity9 club establishing itself in the @entity10 as well as winning the @entity11 in 2013			1
the 29 - year - old winger has signed an extended one - year deal which will keep him at @entity1 until 2018			1
winger @entity2 has signed a new contract at @entity1 until 2018 ' he thoroughly deserves it because of his commitment to his club and how he 's been , ' said @entity0 , speaking ahead of saturday 's @entity10 trip to @entity19			1
' he 's found a home , somewhere he can be himself and bring out the player we now see week in week out			1
' he 's an experienced professional and what he brings to the squad is very valuable			1
' he 's been around at a lot of top clubs and seen a lot of things , but he has to trust you first before he opens up			2
' he 'll admit himself , a little bit he rebelled at times as a youngster but i think he never clicked at clubs where he felt he could express himself			2
' perhaps he was unsure of what he was capable of , but here he 's had that freedom and guidance to be better			2
' he does extras in training , he wants to improve all the time and it 's great to have him here			2
' @entity1 head to the @entity42 on the back of successive league defeats to @entity45 and @entity46 after opening up with three straight wins			1
@entity48 manager @entity0 says the new deal is thoroughly deserved for the 29 - year - old but @entity1 bounced back with a comprehensive 3 - 0 victory over @entity55 in the @entity11 in midweek , the club 's first - ever victory over the @entity53			1
' the morale had n't gone , the boys are fine , ' @entity0 said			2
' they are at the same level as they were at the start of the season and every game because of the way we 've performed			0
' wins give you momentum and it 's nice to go into the next game with a win behind you , but we 're not concentrating on that			0
' we 're looking at performance levels every day and in games which have been there every time			0
' @entity77 has @entity78 available again after last season 's 25 - goal marksman served his one - match suspension for being sent off against @entity46 last weekend in midweek			0
@entity78 has yet to score this season but @entity77 has faith the @entity85 forward will soon be on the scoresheet			0
' i do n't put pressure on players , it 's about the contribution , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's good the goals are spread out			0
it 's good for strikers to score , but we do n't need to put pressure on			0
' they 're good characters and it wo n't be long before they 're scoring again			0
