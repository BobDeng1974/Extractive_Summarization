by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:07 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 04:09 est , 23 november 2013 new limits on @entity5 migrants who claim benefits in @entity7 are to be a key demand in the government ’s attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with @entity12			1
@entity13 is expected to flesh out his goals next week in a planned renegotiation of our ties with @entity18 ahead of an in - out referendum on @entity5 membership due by 2017			1
cabinet sources say the right to ‘ shut the door ’ on unemployment benefits for newcomers and existing migrants who have not lived here for a minimum period would be top of the list			1
@entity13 is expected to announce he is targeting migrants ' benefits when he fleshes out plans for new ties with @entity18 next weeks @entity7 is also expected to demand the right to stop making payments , such as child benefit , to the dependent children of migrant workers			1
the move comes after a poll for the @entity41 identified deep public anxiety about the ending of transitionary immigration restrictions on new @entity5 members @entity46 and @entity47 in january			1
the poll found that 82 per cent did not want citizens of the two countries to gain free access to the @entity7 , 85 per cent said they feared schools and hospitals could not cope and 76 per cent said young @entity7 could lose out on jobs			1
ministers insist they are powerless to prevent a potential influx of workers because of @entity5 rules			0
but after the @entity41 ’s bombshell poll @entity59 backbenchers urged mr @entity13 to stand up to @entity12			1
@entity61 , @entity59 mp for @entity62 , said : ‘ this poll shows exactly where the @entity7 people are			1
the prime minister should listen to that , make a stand , and extend the transitionary arrangements for a further five years			0
' my advice to him is not to worry what the @entity5 say – it is a discredited body			0
he should listen to the @entity7 people			1
’ @entity74 , @entity59 mp for @entity75 , said : ‘ you almost have to be a member of the government not to get it			0
the prime minister and his colleagues need to stop listening to the forces of inertia , and need to get on and act			0
‘ he promised he would reduce inward migration to the tens of thousands , and if he does n’t act within the next eight months , that promise is going to look pretty hollow			0
’ the poll also found more voters trust @entity90 on immigration ( 17 per cent ) than the @entity92 ( 11 per cent )			1
some 44 per cent said they trusted no party			0
@entity95 , @entity59 mp for @entity96 , said : ‘ we need to make it clear that transitional controls will not end on december 31 , and this would send a strong signal to the @entity5 that @entity7 is absolutely serious about renegotiating our terms			2
' ahead of the next election , the @entity59 have to win back the trust of the people on immigration			0
’ sir @entity107 , chairman of the @entity109 think tank , said it was ‘ astonishing ’ that @entity90 came out ahead in the survey			0
he added : ‘ it was under @entity90 that four million foreign migrants arrived in @entity7 , and it was they who left the immigration system in absolute chaos			1
’ next week , a group of @entity92 will unveil their own blueprint for reform of @entity7 ’s relationship with @entity12			1
@entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , from the @entity124 , have identified at least five major changes to @entity5 treaties they say should be at the heart of @entity7 ’s renegotiation			2
they include reforms to protect our financial services industry and an end to limits on work hours			0
@entity137 also want reforms to energy policy , the common agricultural policy , defence and immigration			0
ministers are already furious that the @entity144 has taken legal action to try to prevent welfare curbs on @entity148 @entity5 citizens			0
@entity18 claims making migrants show they are ‘ habitual residents ’ before they can claim child benefit , child tax credit , jobseeker ’s allowance and state pension credit breaks the right to free movement			2
migrants would have to be actively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job to claim unemployment benefits			2
mr @entity13 is thought to be ready to insist on tougher time limits			2
some immigrants already have to wait a year for certain welfare payments , but this would be bolstered to ensure they ‘ pay in ’ to the @entity7 system before they can take out .			2

@entity13 expected to flesh out first *details* of @entity7 demands from new @entity169 as soon as next week
cabinet sources say he will target migrants ' benefits in new deal
mail poll revealed huge anxiety among public over immigration
@entity46 and @entity47 will be given free access to @entity7 from 2014
