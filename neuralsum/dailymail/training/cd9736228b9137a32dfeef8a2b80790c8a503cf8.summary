by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 10:06 est , 13 september 2012 a @entity3 schoolboy 's life has been saved by his parents who each gave up one of their lungs as he grew closer to death			2
@entity8 , 12 , is now on the mend after undergoing the historic op - the first of its kind undertaken in @entity14 - by specialists in @entity16			1
@entity8 is a cystic fibrosis sufferer ; victims often suffer chronic lung and respiratory problems			1
the only hope for him were donor lungs as he struggled for breath each day			2
on the mend : @entity26 sufferer @entity8 , pictured with his family , is now on the mend after undergoing the historic double lung transplant in @entity16 success : @entity8 answers questions during a press conference alongside his mother , sister and professor @entity35 , @entity3 's most famous transplant surgeon cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic condition making the body produce mucus thicker than normal which gradually fills the lungs , reducing and eventually stopping the ability to breathe normally.the condition , normally detected at birth or early childhood , carries the symptoms of salty tasting skin , poor growth and weight gain despite a normal diet , accumulation of thick , sticky mucus , frequent chest infections and coughing or shortness of @entity55 can be managed , but if the lungs decline to such an extent that a patient 's life is threatened doctors may decide to perform a transplant			1
finding a donor is tricky because people with @entity26 must have both lungs replaced to prevent the remaining lung infecting the new lung with bacteria			2
' we were desperately waiting for an organ , waiting for a call every day , ' his father @entity68 said			2
by the time of the operation in april he was surviving with the aid of a ventilator and a heart - lung machine			2
he was flown to the hospital in @entity16 on friday april 13 from his home in southern @entity3 and had the operation 13 days later			2
' for him , 13 seems to be a bit of a lucky number , ' added mr @entity8			1
' the transplant was his last chance , ' said dr @entity85 , the doctor in charge of his care			0
' the hospital would not have operated on his parents if it had not been an absolute necessity			0
' professor dr @entity35 , @entity3 's most famous transplant surgeon , said : ' @entity8 was already somewhere between heaven and earth when we operated			1
he was living in a state of almost perpetual anaesthesia			0
but he is a real fighter			0
we had a team of 40 and he came through			0
' @entity8 was lucky on two counts : both of his parents had compatible blood groups , and their lungs were bigger than his , which is necessary for a successful transplant			1
' if we had enough organ donors in @entity3 , the doctors would not have to resort to living donors , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' we are happy and thankful that we and the doctors were able to help @entity8			1
' @entity108 and @entity8 ’ mother @entity107 had no doubts about each donating a lung to save their boy			1
' it was immediately clear what we had to do in order to save our son , ' she said			0
this or nothing : dr @entity85 demonstrates how the operation will work			0
he had said the transplant was @entity8 ' last chance crack team : surgeons at the @entity123 performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into @entity8			1
the procedure took close to six hours surgeons at the @entity123 ( @entity129 ) performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into @entity8			1
the procedure took close to six hours			0
' the operations went well , the parents were able to leave hospital after ten days , ' added dr @entity85			0
' the transplantation worked well with @entity8			1
we were able to remove the tubes from him two days after the operation			0
' @entity8 was released from hospital after 155 days			1
and although his quality of life has improved enormously – he can play football and ride his bike – his immune system remains weak and he is being tutored at home			0
@entity8 , whose sister @entity148 shares his love for @entity151 football club , said : ' i am especially proud of my parents			2
they gave me their lungs so i could live			0
now i can keep up with them on bike rides			0
' while this was the first procedure of its kind in @entity14 , doctors say it will probably remain an exception because of the need for two donors at a time with the requisite blood groups .			0
