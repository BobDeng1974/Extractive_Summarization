but given that @entity16 could comfortably hire an entire @entity18 island with staff for his honeymoon with new wife @entity16 , it 's all the more endearing that the two have chosen to spend it in low - key style in @entity4			1
the couple 's @entity25 adventure continued last night with a simple evening stroll in a picturesque village on the @entity3 in @entity4			1

that 's amore : @entity16 places a hand on his new wife 's back as they take in the art at the @entity77 tourist trail : the couple were casually dressed in jeans and t - shirts as they listened to a priest talk about @entity86 's art eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining , the two opted for a meal at a kosher restaurant called @entity132 in @entity67 's @entity133 where they enjoyed a simple @entity25 meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce			1
