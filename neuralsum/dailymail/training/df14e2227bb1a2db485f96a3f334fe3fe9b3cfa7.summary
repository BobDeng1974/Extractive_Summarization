by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:00 am on 7th july 2011 the cost of using the internet on a tablet in @entity5 is to be more than halved excessive charges for using smartphones and laptops to access the internet and emails while abroad are to be slashed			1
travellers can be billed up to 50 times more than at home to download a song , picture or map , generating huge bills			0
these so - called data roaming charges can be as much as £ 10.70 per megabyte , which would be equivalent to downloading a single picture or a minute of music			2
however , the @entity22 has announced plans for a cap that will bring down the average charge of £ 2 per megabyte to 80p from july next year			2
there are plans to cut the figure further to 45p in july 2014			0
the new price regime will only apply to @entity22 citizens visiting another member state			2
there will be no protection for those travelling to other destinations such as @entity36 , the @entity37 or @entity38			0
the proposals were outlined by @entity22 digital chief @entity40 , who is hoping new companies , such as supermarkets , will enter the market to increase competition			0
the eventual aim is to bring the cost of using smartphones and laptops overseas to around the same level as at home			0
the @entity22 has already capped the price of calls and texts from other @entity22 nations			1
@entity55 , of @entity5 consumers ' group @entity56 , welcomed the price cap , saying : ' it 's unjustifiable that data roaming can be 50 times more expensive than when at home			1
' the move comes after the @entity22 last week extended the cap on mobile phone call roaming charges by a further four years , to 2016			1
however , it comes as a blow to mobile operators who will also have to comply with new regulations on calls and sms messages			1
savings : the cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009 the proposals to cut the cost of data roaming are part of plans by @entity40 to slash cross-border mobile charges by 2015			1
and there will be a clause to phase out the price caps before 2016 , should the structural measures result in cheaper international calls			0
@entity88 , public policy director at @entity89 , told the @entity90 : ' it 's good the @entity92 is reflecting on new options for regulating the roaming market and has recognised that price caps have major drawbacks			0
' last week an @entity22 directive was introduced to force down the cost of making and receiving mobile phone calls while in @entity5			1
@entity22 's digital agenda commissioner @entity40 wants to ' address the lack of competition ' the rules mean that the maximum permitted charge will be no more than 32p per minute , excluding @entity105 , for calls made while abroad - down from 35p			1
it also will cost not more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in @entity22 countries			1
the cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one			0
the changes bring the @entity22 a step closer to making sure that within three years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or abroad			1
commissioners have taken action because network operators are making profits of an astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in @entity5 and a staggering 400 per cent on calls received			1
the cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one			0
but despite this , existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak			2
operators must only apply an automatic 50 euros or £ 45 cut - off limit on accounts unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise , but need not do anything else			0
operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit			0
the @entity22 's digital agenda commissioner @entity40 admitted last week that despite the cuts , a lack of open competition means operators are still making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use			1
still expensive : consumers arriving in @entity5 by air , sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high ' these latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and receiving voice calls when in another @entity22 country during the coming year , ' he said			1
' but we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long - lasting structural approach			0
' @entity92 will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long - term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets			0
' making calls : 3p cheaper receiving calls : capped at 10p per minute sending texts : 10p ( maximum ) receiving texts : free data roaming ( internet ) : £ 45 limit * browsing internet or receiving emails : no more than 81p per megabyte from july 2012 , falling to 40p by 2014 * unless requested			2
compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the @entity92 called the ' roaming rip - off '			2
a legal claim by the networks that the @entity92 was exceeding its powers failed last year , and rates fell further			0
action by @entity191 against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer - driven moves by the @entity22			2
on average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another @entity22 country since 2007			1
last week 's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the @entity92 first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily			2
the current roaming rules apply until june 2012 and the @entity92 is due to present its plans for the following period next week .			0

charges for internet on smartphone or tablet in @entity22 more than halved
price - cap is a blow to mobile operators
cost of calls drops to 32p per minute , down from 35p
calls received in @entity5 to cost no more than 10p per minute
@entity22 wants same charges at home and abroad by 2015
