at times last week it seemed some were ready to award @entity1 the @entity3 title on the back on a 3 - 1 win at @entity6			2
and though in the end they did re-discover some of that momentum on saturday , the over-riding lesson of their victory over @entity13 was the stark reminder that @entity1 ’s season will be a degree tougher in the long run and that they still struggle against well - organised teams			1
true , they won comfortably enough in the end with goals from @entity21 and @entity22			1
and they could even afford a carnival moment towards the end , with @entity25 coming on , a hero returning to his natural home , on 79 minutes			2
@entity28 : @entity21 runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for @entity1 against @entity13 on his home @entity3 debut in a 2 - 0 win at the double : @entity1 winger @entity22 made the game comfortable with a strike from the edge of the area in the 77th - minute to break @entity13 hearts finish : @entity21 slots the ball past @entity41 in the @entity13 goal to put @entity1 1 - 0 up after 62 minutes at @entity43 that 's what money buys you : @entity1 's £ 32million summer signing @entity21 opened the scoring at @entity43 after 62 minutes on saturday save ! @entity1 's number one @entity49 made a terrific save from @entity51 when @entity1 were just 1 - 0 up to ensure that the home side bagged the points triumph : @entity22 ( centre ) celebrates with fellow goalscorer @entity21 ( left ) after netting @entity1 's second goal to seal the game against @entity13 @entity1 : @entity49 8 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6 , @entity63 7 , @entity64 7 ( @entity65 6 , 70 ) , @entity22 6.5 , @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 6.5 , 64 ) , @entity21 7 ( @entity25 6.5 , 80 )			1

@entity13 : @entity41 8.5 , @entity74 7 , @entity75 6.5 , @entity76 6.5 , @entity77 8 ( @entity78 6.5 , 73 ) , @entity79 6.5 , @entity80 7 , @entity81 7.5 ( @entity82 6 , 68 ) , @entity51 7 , @entity83 6.5 ( @entity84 84 )			1

booking : @entity77 ( 52 )			0
yet though all ended happily , @entity1 laboured incredibly to get ahead in the first place			2
they were truly abject in the first half , languid and one paced , lacking both tempo and creativity , just as they had been for many games last season			0
@entity100 disappeared down the tunnel a good three minutes before half time to prepare his team talk			2
judging by his team ’s response in the second half , their manager had let them know quite how bad it was , though somewhat bizarrely the coach seemed to think the weather - cool and breezy for the time of year - was partly to blame			0
‘ we have lots of work to do , ’ said @entity100 afterwards			2
‘ our first half showed clearly that we have to improve			0
this week i trained at 3 o’clock because i was expecting this , as it ’s not the best weather to play football , because you get a bit lazy			0
but i was unsuccessful in that because the team was lazy in the first half , which i did n’t like			0
but in the second half everything improved and they showed that they wanted it			0
‘ i think the weather makes players lazy , lose a bit of tension and sharpness in the body and after that you pass slow you move slow and you do n’t react to the second balls and by the time you wake up it ’s half time ‘ at half time we had to be a little bit emotional with them and make them realise we were at risk , ’ said @entity100			1
‘ i was n’t annoyed but i told them that if you have the same feeling i have we ’re not in trouble , we will change			0
but if you do n’t we ’re in trouble			0
it ’s important not to lose points against teams that normally you would beat			0
’ it was n’t simply that @entity13 set up well and frustrated @entity1			1
@entity77 was the most dominant presence in the midfield in the first half while @entity81 was always lively and indeed produced the first shot on target of the game on 35 minutes , which @entity49 got down well to save			1
‘ i ’m proud but disappointed , ’ said @entity13 manager @entity150 afterwards			1
‘ i ’m disappointed we were n’t able to to convert an encouraging performance into a reward with points			0
the good thing is we created chances throughout the game			0
we played well but as always it will be about how efficient we are in both penalty areas			0
’ frustration : @entity1 manager @entity100 stands with his arms out - stretched as he watches on during the match against @entity13 at @entity43 quiet : @entity1 's £ 32million summer signing @entity21 ( right ) is challenged by @entity13 's @entity77 during a frustrating first half for the forward power game : @entity1 's @entity58 ( left ) tussles with @entity13 's @entity80 during the @entity3 match at @entity43 click here to view our brilliant @entity165 for more analysis , facts and figures from all of the @entity3 matches			1
extra coverage : for breakdown of the goals , such as this one showing the build - up to @entity21 's striker for @entity1 , click on the link above where @entity63 had thrilled on monday , in the opening 45 minutes he looked as ineffective as his midfield partner @entity62			1
@entity21 felt the sharp end of his manager ’s tongue at one stage and @entity22 had reverted to type , leaving @entity61 to deal alone with the frequent incursions of @entity81			1
half time did indeed prove pivotal			0
all of the above improved considerably and within minutes of the re-start @entity64 had hit the post with a shot from outside the box and @entity41 had pulled off an excellent save by pushing wide a @entity58 header			2
yet @entity1 were also more open at the back and @entity49 was called upon when @entity77 played in @entity51 , who forced the @entity193 into a fine save with his right leg on 52 minutes			1
and @entity51 had an even better chance when put clean through by @entity81 on 55 minutes , @entity49 again being forced to save with an out - stretched leg			1
passion : the @entity1 players embrace @entity21 in the corner of the pitch after the striker put the @entity202 1 - 0 ahead against @entity13 at @entity43 emotional : @entity203 ( right ) left the field to a standing ovation as the @entity43 faithful joyously welcomed back @entity25 to the @entity3 @entity207 : @entity21 ( left ) , who put @entity1 ahead , is congratulated by manager @entity100 as he is substituted for @entity25 after 80 minutes @entity41 then got a decisive touch to a lovely @entity63 chip on 57 minutes but @entity21 finally made the breakthrough , when @entity64 played a lovely through ball for @entity58 on 63 minutes			1
the @entity1 right back managed to take out two defenders with a neat turn and cross for the @entity216 - born striker , who was making his home debut			2
his chest down looked heavy , but the ball fell kindly and he swept it in past @entity41 from close range			0
having finally breached @entity13 , @entity1 would never again look uncomfortable			1
and when @entity63 played in @entity22 on 77 minutes , the @entity193 simply cut inside his man and shot past @entity41 for 2 - 0			1
the game safe , there was time for that a sentimental moment with @entity25 , after two years away , coming on to a hero ’s welcome			2
high in the stands , @entity1 owner @entity227 beamed – a change from his usual default scowl – and wildly clapped his hands above his head in delight			2
never have we seen the @entity235 quite so animated			0
safe to say , his mood had changed somewhat from the opening 45 minutes			0
full flow : @entity65 ( left ) of @entity1 competes for the ball with @entity13 striker @entity83 for the ball during a tight affair at @entity43 on saturday contest : @entity1 's @entity22 ( centre ) runs at the @entity13 defence during the match at @entity43 on saturday challenge : @entity1 's @entity66 slides along the ground as @entity13 's @entity75 tries to compete for the ball at @entity43 pain : @entity1 forward @entity66 clutches his ankle during the match at @entity43 against @entity13 but he was able to continue playing			1

@entity21 opens the scoring in the 62nd minute as he taps in a shot from just four yards out to break the deadlock
@entity22 doubles @entity1 's advantage after 77 minutes as the @entity202 make it two wins in two league games
@entity13 forward @entity51 was *expertly* *denied* a goal before @entity1 's opener by @entity49
@entity264 replaced by @entity25 in the 80th minute as both men were applauded by @entity1 fans
@entity100 's side move on to six points after two matches while @entity150 's men have a solitary point
