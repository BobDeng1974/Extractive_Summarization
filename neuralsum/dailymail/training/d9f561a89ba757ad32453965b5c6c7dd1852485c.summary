no one knew where we were going to , all as we knew it might be our resting place			0
' we knew it was hell we were going because we were told we had got to shift the @entity128 out of it			0
' we shifted him right enough , but , oh the awful mess , nothing but corpses everywhere			0
i put my foot on a poor chap , but could not help it , there were so many			0
