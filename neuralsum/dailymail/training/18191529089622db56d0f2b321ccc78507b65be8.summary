by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:42 pm on 27th july 2011 a narcoleptic student who abandoned her degree when she could n't stay awake during lectures is demanding £ 34,000 compensation			1
@entity6 , 49 , has taken her disability discrimination case against @entity8 to the @entity9 - and attended the hearing with a duvet and pillows in case she needed a nap			1
mrs @entity6 says the university did not do enough to help her while she studied for a degree in military and international history			1
@entity18 : @entity6 , pictured arriving at court with a pillow yesterday , claims that @entity8 discriminated against her she suffers from a disorder which means she needs up to 16 hours of sleep every day and is prone to nodding off in the afternoons			1
her problem - described as ' narcoleptic in nature ' - meant she could not complete her degree and left the university at the end of her first year in 2005			2
while her classmates were taking notes during lectures , the mature student was often fast asleep , oblivious to her lecturers ' teaching			0
she complained that the university 's provision of written notes for the lectures she slept through was insufficient support to enable her to take her end - of - year exams			0
the university offered to let her restart her course , with her tuition free of charge , but mrs @entity6 was unhappy and complained to the students ' watchdog , the @entity43			1
@entity8 : mrs @entity6 claims that the provision of lecture notes was inadequate to enable her to take her exams after an investigation , the @entity43 recommended that the university pay for ms @entity6 to restart her first year , give her £ 2,500 compensation for inconvenience and distress , and to review its procedures in relation to helping disabled students			1
but the decision did not go far enough , mrs @entity6 claimed , because it did not express a view that she was a victim of disability discrimination and left her far short of the £ 34,000 payout she hoped to receive			1
at the @entity61 last year , mr @entity60 rejected a judicial review challenge to the decision , in which mrs @entity6 's lawyers argued that the @entity43 should have recommended compensation at a much higher level			1
today - clutching a pillow - she took her case to the @entity9 , where her lawyers began a challenge to the @entity43 's refusal to make a discrimination finding			0
in a case which he says could have wide - ranging effects for other disabled students , @entity73 said a refusal to express a view on the central issue meant it is possible that universities could get away with discrimination			0
' in refusing to express a view about disability discrimination that may have been suffered by a complainant , where its procedure may be the only forum the complaint is likely to be aired in , the @entity43 may inadvertently be enabling discriminatory behaviour to continue without being exposed as such , ' he said			0
he added that , if the @entity43 came to its decision to recommend compensation and a review of procedures based on discrimination , then it should have made that clear			2
@entity43 barrister @entity99 said it had considered the substance of mrs @entity6 's complaint about how her disability was addressed by the university			2
it had taken into account the @entity106 and made findings about a failure to provide sufficient assistance , then made recommendations on how to deal with it , he said			0
it was not obliged to do more			0
speaking outside court , mrs @entity6 said that , despite getting promising marks for the two essays she wrote during her first term , she felt unable to take the end - of - year exams			2
she said she needs at least 12 , and up to 16 , hours of sleep every day , but knows when she is going to fall asleep and does not do so unexpectedly			0
the judges reserved their decision on the appeal until a later date .			0

@entity6 turned down @entity8 *’s* offer of restarting her course free of charge
she also turned down a payment of £ 2,500 compensation for inconvenience and distress
