the knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear			1
for one mother though , the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother			1
in 2008 , @entity8 faced the news that her 21 - year - old son @entity10 had fatally stabbed her mother , @entity12 , in her own home , in @entity14			1
@entity10 , who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture , killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis			1
his mental state seriously deteriorated after his @entity23 's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene			1
@entity10 had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that @entity44 , a notorious drug dealer , might be a bad influence on him			1
@entity44 , who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm , was shot to death in 2002 , following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs			0
following her son 's death @entity23 went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and , according to @entity27 , had a close relationship with @entity10			1
murdered @entity12 ( right ) was an anti-gun campaigner , pictured here with fellow campaigner @entity60 outside @entity61 in 2008 slain uncle : @entity23 's son @entity44 was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs she said : ' if he was in trouble , he 'd go to my mum probably more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better			1
he was her grandson - they were just really close			2
' despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about @entity10 as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence			1
his uncle @entity28 admitted : ' we had worries about him , because it seemed that he was impressed with , kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff			0
' you know , there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just , kind of like , saying , " you do n't need to be focused on that kind of stuff			2
you need to focus more on your education , your music " - you know , things that are quite playful , things that are positive			2
' do n't look at the negative and do n't be , you know , tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle			0
' sadly , there was nothing the family could do to help him and as @entity10 started to dabble more and more in drugs , his paranoia started to increase			2
@entity27 said : ' he kind of lost his way a little bit and i , kind of , guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years , in ecstasy , cocaine , and i used to say to @entity10 , " you have n't got the mind - set to get through stuff like that , you know , take ecstasy and things like that			1
it 's not good for you and it 'll bring you down			2
" ' he would go , " i know mum , i do n't do it any more			0
" ' @entity10 's uncle @entity124 showed off a selection of pictures of his mother			1
he says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother @entity28 said : ' he was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles , aliens , he was having these kinds of thoughts			2
' people 's eye colours were changing , you know , to these luminous colours			2
he threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck			0
' it was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be			0
he wanted to be a hard man , he wanted to be tough , he wanted to be fearless			0
' he wanted to be this character that was n't him and my mum was like , " well , i let him go out tonight , god knows what 's going to happen to him			0
" ' finally - following an incident in which @entity10 was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital			1
it was to prove too little , too late			0
the day after his release @entity23 , who had taken @entity10 in , went missing			1
she was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by @entity28 but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up			0
@entity28 was horrified when he was called to his mother 's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding , only to find out that she had been killed			1
@entity28 was eventually called to come down to his mother 's house , where he learned the devastating news that @entity23 had been stabbed to death			2
@entity27 said : ' i was hysterical			2
i would give anything , you know , to have my mum back			0
you know , to hear that call , i 've had that call before about my brother , about my younger brother			0
' worse news was to come when the family made the horrifying discovery that it was @entity10 behind the killing			2
however , @entity27 has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did			1
' the realisation that your son 's done what he 's done , it 's just gut - wrenching			1
i never felt , " you horrible , horrible person			0
" i never felt that			0
' part of me sometimes thinks , " would it be easier to dislike , not love @entity10 if he had n't been a drug addict and he 'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something , or he was just a nasty person ? ' because he was n't , and it was the mental health , and he loved his grandma , and he was n't a bad person , it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was			1
' having pleaded guilty to manslaughter @entity10 is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and @entity27 goes to visit him on a regular basis			1
she said the first encounter was difficult : ' first seeing him , where he was , it was heartbreaking			0
i did n’t know if he ’d remember , and he remembered what he ’d done but he was still in a psychotic state			0
' he was still delusional about what he ’d done and how he ’d done it , and to go and sit and listen to your son , your baby , saying this about what he ’s done to his grandma and your mum is the worst			0
' however , @entity28 has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again : ' personally i ’ve not seen @entity10 since the day that he got sentenced			1
' i just found it difficult to find a way to look in his eyes and speak to him about it			0
i dream about looking him in the eye , i have dreams of seeing him , i have this mixed emotion when i see him			0
' i want to run up to him and give him a big hug and say , ‘ do you know what , i love you , ’ and then i start to doubt that he did do it by accident			0
