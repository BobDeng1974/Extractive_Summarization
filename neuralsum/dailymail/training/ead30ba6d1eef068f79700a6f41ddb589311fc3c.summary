' led by former high - ranking @entity91 official @entity90 , the report found more far - reaching academic fraud than previous investigations by the school and the @entity95			0
many at the university hoped @entity90 's investigation would bring some closure to the long - running scandal , which is rooted in an @entity95 investigation focused on improper benefits within the football program in 2010			0
instead , findings of a systemic problem in the @entity14 and @entity16 department could lead to @entity95 sanctions and possible dismissal of additional @entity3 staff			1

a half - dozen officials and @entity3 athletics director @entity138 declined to say whether anyone would lose their job			2

@entity90 's staff has briefed @entity95 investigators at least three times , plans another briefing on the final report and has ' enjoyed a strong cooperative relationship , ' according to the report			2

it said athletics staffers steered athletes to classes that also became popular with fraternities and other everyday students looking for an easy grade			2

@entity189 was indicted in december on a felony fraud charge , though it was dropped after he agreed to cooperate with @entity90 's probe			0
it was @entity17 who started the paper classes as a way to help struggling students with ' watered - down requirements ' not long after @entity189 became chairman of the curriculum in 1992 , according to the report			1
though not a faculty member , she managed the courses by registering students , assigning them topics and then handing out high grades regardless of the work			2
by 1999 , in an apparent effort to work around the number of independent studies students could take , @entity17 began offering lecture classes that did n't meet and were instead paper classes			1
after her retirement in 2009 , @entity189 graded papers ' with an eye to boosting ' a student 's grade - point average , even asking @entity17 's successor to look up gpas before he 'd issue a grade for a course , according to the report			2
