whisky drink advert starring @entity1 is cleared of encouraging underage drinking after the star agreed to front the stylish tv advertising campaign			1
campaigners at @entity6 argued that the former footballer in the @entity9 advert would appeal to youngsters and make drinking alcohol appear essential to social success			1
they pointed out that @entity1 has traded heavily on his appeal to children , not least by supporting the @entity16 campaign to boost participation in sport			2
@entity1 , pictured , has been cleared by the @entity19 of encouraging underage drinking after he starred in an advert for @entity9 as he is no longer a role model to children @entity1 starred in the stylish advert for @entity9 which was directed by @entity24 consequently , they argued that his association with the drinks brand , which is owned by drinks giant @entity28 , sent the wrong message to youngsters that drinking was cool and sexy			1
however , advertising watchdogs have rejected the complaint after deciding @entity1 could no longer be viewed as a role model or hero for the nation ’s children the father of four ’s decision to appear in the @entity9 commercial was the first time he has promoted alcohol and he claims it reflected his own change in tastes as he got older			1
the expensive commercial was directed by @entity24 , who previously directed the @entity48 movies starring @entity49 , and played heavily on the theme of @entity1 as a style icon			1
he was seen as an action man in leathers riding a motorcycle through a spectacular and craggy @entity56 landscape before meeting up with friends carrying a bottle of @entity9			2
then , wearing a green velour suit jacket with a black bow tie , he was seen pouring the drink into tumblers before the group was shown posing for photographs			0
the ad ended with a shot of the product and the caption ‘ @entity9 single grain scotch whisky			0
’ @entity6 complained to the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , highlighting concerns that @entity1 was promoting any form of alcoholic drink			1
they said the commercial , seen on tv and on websites , implied that drinking was a key component of social success or acceptance , and that refusal was a sign of weakness			0
and they also argued the commercial broke industry rules by implying drinking was a key component to the success of a personal relationship or social event			0
anti-alcohol campaigners argued that @entity1 promoting the whisky implied that alcohol was a key component or social success or acceptance the group pointed out @entity1 ’s partnership with the @entity97 , which he is no longer associated with , plus his role as a @entity100 goodwill ambassador and the fact he won a @entity103 's @entity102 earlier this year			1
however , the @entity19 rejected the complaint , saying in its view @entity1 had not played for a @entity107 team for more than ten years and therefore had no special appeal to children			1
the watchdog said : ‘ we noted that he had not played for a @entity107 club in the last decade and was therefore unlikely to have particular resonance for children on the basis of his sporting career alone , or have strong appeal on that basis			0
’ that decision has been slammed by @entity6 , whose deputy chief executive , @entity119 , said : ‘ given his other roles promoting sport and the importance of a healthy lifestyle , we think the public will be amazed to hear the @entity19 does n’t think @entity1 is a role model for children			1
‘ how can we take the @entity19 seriously when they deem that a global icon does n’t appeal to young people and that having one of the most famous people in the world in a whisky advert is not linking the promotion of alcohol with social success ? ’ she added : ‘ this ruling shows why we need tighter restrictions on advertising regulations to ensure children and young people have far greater protection from alcohol advertising			2
’ at the time the commercial was made , @entity1 explained his involvement , saying : ‘ @entity148 has a rich history and i ’m proud to be working at the heart of a home - grown brand which has built an incredible heritage over 400 years			2
' working closely with @entity28 , we look forward to collaborating on @entity9 , valuing and treasuring the @entity155 traditions while reinventing this whisky for years to come			0
' he added : ' i am starting to enjoy whisky and have done for the last few years			0
this is a natural movement - but there has had to be a movement			0
' @entity28 defended the advertisement and campaign on the basis that the footballer was no longer a hero to children in this country			0
rather , the firm said it had chosen @entity1 because he had a strong appeal to its target group of men aged 25 - 40			2
the @entity19 said : ‘ they stated that his appeal was predominantly to those in this age range and that he did not have strong appeal to children and was not a person whose example children are likely to follow			0
‘ @entity28 stated that @entity1 was primarily known for his role as a former professional footballer and that he had limited resonance with young people in the @entity107 , particularly in comparison with current players and other cultural youth icons			2
they noted that he had not played in the @entity189 for over 10 years , retired from professional football in 2013 and had only lived in the @entity107 for two of the last 11 years			0
’ they provided a list of @entity1 's commercial partnerships , including breitling watches , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 , as evidence of his appeal to adults rather than children .			1
