@entity0 sent another reminder to the @entity3 selectors on tuesday night when he was named @entity4 at the @entity6 ‘ oscars du rugby ’			1
the @entity8 flanker , one of @entity10 ’s standout players , has not played for @entity11 since 2010 because of the @entity13 ’s policy of not selecting overseas - based players			1
but @entity0 , 28 , has been one of the most consistent performers in the star - studded @entity6 league and said on @entity17 : ‘ thank you everyone that came tonight # @entity21 i am honoured to get it			2
. even tho the whole # rctteam deserved it ! ! thanks again ’ honoured : @entity0 tweeted his delight at picking up the prestigious @entity26 award standout : flanker @entity0 has become one of @entity10 's top players out in @entity6 with @entity8 the dynamic back - row is reported to be considering a move that would allow him to play for @entity6 , exploiting a loophole that lets players switch allegiances before the @entity34			1
however , @entity36 chief executive @entity35 said on tuesday that he is hoping to tighten the rules , which were intended to help smaller countries compete in the sevens competition at the @entity40			2
‘ there is a regulations committee that will look at all applications for transfer and they will look to see if it ’s for bona fide @entity47 reasons , ’ said @entity35			2
‘ there is a safety net and any transfer will have to be passed by the committee			0
they will act according to the spirit of the law			0
banished : @entity0 has n't played for @entity11 since 2010 due to an @entity13 policy on overseas - based players ‘ for example , if we have huge props applying for a career in sevens , then we ’ll smell a rat			1
that ’s an obvious example and there will be some cases that are in a grey area , but we want to ensure the integrity of the regulation and the spirit behind it is upheld			0
‘ any obvious abuses that go counter to that spirit of why we ’re doing this will be caught in the regulations committee net			0
but players will move in both codes by coming into the sevens game – that will happen			0
