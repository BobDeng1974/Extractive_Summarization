by @entity0 published : 04:00 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 1 may 2013 a great - grandmother was left embarrassed after having a driveway laid - just after the council had put a lamp post right in front of it			2
pensioner @entity7 had the work done before she applied to have the kerb dropped outside her property in @entity11 , @entity12			1
and just days before the builders turned up to create the 10 - yard driveway outside her detached home council workmen turned up to replace the lampposts			2
blocked driveway : mrs @entity17 had the new driveway installed outside her home after council workmen had put up the lamppost mrs @entity17 , who is believed to be aged in her 70s , does n't drive but had the work done so her family could park their car when they come to visit			1
@entity29 normally charge up to £ 1,200 to drop the kerb - although in this instance it may be higher because they have to move the lamppost			1
@entity17 , who has lived in her £ 250,000 home for the last 30 years , admitted : ' last year they issued parking space permits outside , i have no car since my husband died but i have friends and people come to visit and nowhere for them to park so i thought i should have a driveway put in			2
' this lamppost was put in by the council , i had a small wall there at first			2
the contractor for the driveway said that he was going to put in to the council to have a dropped kerb and he 's going to apply for the lamppost to be moved as well			1
' he thought he would do the drive first then put in for it to be moved - it 's all the wrong way round and now everybody has come and photographed it			0
' mistake : mrs @entity17 , who has lived in the property for more than 30 years , has now applied to the council to have the kerb dropped flashback : the property with a larger garden before mrs @entity17 had a driveway fitted - and before a lamppost was fitted right outside ' i had the work done because there was nowhere for my family to park when they visited me			1
but i have not got a parking space at the moment because of the lamp post			0
' a spokesman for the council confirmed they had now received a request from the pensioner to have the kerb dropped so cars can access her property			1
' clearly this will require the street light to be moved , ' the spokesman said			0
' we are assisting mrs @entity17 with her application for dropped curb including making the necessary arrangements for the street light column to be moved			0
' we would normally seek to recover the costs associated with work to lower a kerb or moving a street light			0
however each case is individually assessed and this is no exception			0
' we will ensure that the work to provide a dropped curb and relocate the street light are co-ordinated to keep costs and any inconvenience to a minimum			0

@entity7 had the new driveway installed after the lamppost went up
she will have to *pay* around £ 1,200 to have the kerb dropped
