impeccable style is n't something you 'd necessarily associate with someone who crunches numbers for a living - let alone a man living in 16th century northern @entity6			2
however , long before @entity9 turned selfie taking into an art form , @entity8 accountant @entity7 was busy piecing together the world 's first fashion book			1
in an incredible project that appears to be unique , style - obsessed @entity7 - who was born in @entity14 , @entity8 , in 1497 - commissioned 137 watercolour paintings of himself over a 40 year period			1
he initially commissioned 35 images to document his sartorial choices from childhood up to his early 20s but ended up with 101 more pictures			0
the extraordinary undertaking ended up spanning over 40 years and only ceased when @entity7 reached the age of 63			1
as no other pictorial record like this exists , historians believe @entity7 created the first ever fashion tome - similar to 21st century online blogs			1
unlike today 's fashion bloggers , @entity7 , who spent a large part of his income on clothing , did n't have @entity52 filters and @entity53 to rely on			0
he opted for surprisingly elaborate outfits which were an example of cutting - edge fashion of the time and used his clothes to make a political statement			1
he bound all his outfit paintings into a volume called the book of clothes he boldly combined patterns , colours and decoration in a variety outfits in a unique lifetime project @entity7 , who was born in 1497 , is now regarded as the first fashion blogger @entity7 donned a red and yellow outfit ( echoing the colours of the @entity73 â€™s flag ) when @entity74 returned to @entity8 , as a show of his allegiance to @entity77			1
after amassing an extensive collection of paintings , the fashion innovator had the pages bound and made into the ultimate vanity project , a volume titled @entity84			0
among the portraits are pictures of him in festive clothing for the emperor @entity89 's visit to @entity14 in 1518 , dressed up for a rich banker 's wedding in 1527 , and in mourning garb for his father 's death in 1519			0
he added comments to each of the images explaining when the outfit was worn along with his @entity100 motto omne quare suum quiam - every because has a why			0
now the tome has inspired a new set of photographs of fictional male dandies by artist and photographer @entity105			0
@entity105 , alongside her fashion designer sister @entity107 and professor @entity109 , has created five modern photographic recreations - printed to large scale - telling the fictional story of @entity113 , a young man from north @entity114 , who is obsessed with clothes			1
the modern photographs are based upon images commissioned between 1520 and 1560 by @entity7			2
