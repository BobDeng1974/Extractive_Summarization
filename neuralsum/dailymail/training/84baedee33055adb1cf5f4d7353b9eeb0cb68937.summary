wearing a pristine white shirt and jeans , her hair swept up primly , the girlfriend of billionaire football club owner @entity5 clearly wanted to project the image of a sophisticated art expert when she gave an interview to an upmarket fashion blog			1
but if that was her intention , it was fatally undermined by the fact that she was pictured sitting on a chair made from a lifelike mannequin of a scantily clad black woman lying on her back with her legs in the air			1
worse , the pictures appeared online on @entity20 , on which millions of @entity21 commemorate the achievements of the man who did so much to promote black rights			2
after being accused of racism , socialite @entity26 has now been forced to apologise			1
the darling of the celebrity circuit — who owns her own art gallery in @entity32 — insisted the artwork was , in fact , a protest against prejudice			1
this image of socialite @entity26 sitting on a chair made from a lifelike mannequin of a black woman lying on back with her legs in the was published on @entity20			1
the chair is based on an earlier work by @entity45 artist @entity44 in 1969 the chair , designed by a @entity49 artist @entity48 , was ‘ an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics ’ , she claimed			1
her somewhat self - serving explanation is not unlike that offered by the man on whose erotic furniture @entity48 based his chair			1
it was in 1969 that @entity45 artist @entity44 , a friend and contemporary of @entity60 at the @entity61 , designed a set of sculptures — a hat - stand , table and chair — all incorporating fibreglass models of submissive women ( although they were white , not black ) in skimpy leather outfits			1
the sculptures were cast in fibreglass by a company that produced mannequins for shop windows at a cost of £ 1,500 each			0
their leather clothing was made by the same firm that supplied the skin - tight cat - suits worn by @entity80 as @entity81 in the tv series @entity82			2
they caused a storm of protest when they were first exhibited in 1970			2
feminists , not surprisingly , took great exception to the way they objectified women , turning them into nothing more than a piece of furniture , something on which men could hang their hats or put their pint glass			2
fantasising about women as furniture is known to psychologists as forniphilia			0
the radical feminist magazine @entity104 suggested @entity44 must be terrified of women and have a ‘ castration complex ’			1
when the sculptures were later exhibited at the @entity108 in @entity109 , stink bombs and smoke bombs were thrown at them			0
the original : @entity44 created ' @entity114 ' in 1969			1
it was exhibited at the @entity108 in @entity109 and at the @entity116 ‘ there was an incredible furore on the @entity119 , ’ @entity44 later recalled			1
the @entity121 newspaper suggested he should be banned from exhibiting			0
‘ it was tough stuff and i was n’t expecting it			0
’ some years later , when ‘ @entity114 ’ was shown at the @entity116 , it was attacked with paint - stripper that shrivelled the skin on the mannequin ’s face			2
it has since been restored			0
the attackers were never caught but as it took place on @entity134 , it was assumed feminists were behind it			0
like @entity137 , @entity44 claimed the art never set out to be offensive — and was protesting against sexism , not revelling in it			1
his principal aim , he says , was to be iconoclastic			0
with sculpture as an art form having gone out of fashion by the @entity145 , @entity44 wanted to revive it , but by using industrial materials			1
‘ my idea was to offend canons of art at the time			2
’ yet he has admitted being motivated by other , somewhat less lofty , impulses than artistic radicalism			0
part of the inspiration came from the sight of scantily clad women walking round @entity109 in mini-skirts and hot - pants			0
@entity44 says : ‘ i was living in @entity159 and i had an interest in the female figure and the sexual charge that comes from it			1
every saturday on the @entity164 you saw that skirts were shorter , the body was being displayed in some new way			0
the following week someone would up the ante			0
’ six editions of three pieces of ' furniture ' were produced and an entire set was bought by the @entity176 playboy @entity175 those visions were to fuel his artistic imagination , producing not only his women as furniture , but striking images of seemingly endless legs wearing stilettoes			2
born in @entity184 and brought up in @entity109 , @entity44 moved to @entity185 after being expelled from art college for ‘ excessive independence ’			1
during the @entity145 , his work became more and more sexually explicit , until his friend @entity60 observed that one of his paintings looked like an illustration to a fetishist magazine			1
@entity44 , rather than feeling chastened , began collecting such magazines and his art became ever more focused on sex : women with whips , women in bondage wear , women with painted male genitalia superimposed across their torsos			1
but he became frustrated that the curves of his fantasy women could not be adequately expressed on a flat canvas			0
so he decided to turn to sculpture , using modern , industrial materials rather than traditional clay or metal			0
his wife , @entity211 posed happily for a magazine alongside the table and hat - stand , kneeling topless on a chair , wearing stockings and a corset , looking disturbingly like one of her husband ’s sculptures			0
artist @entity44 , pictured aged 32 with part of the ' woman table ' in 1969 , claims the artworks were a protest against sexism although never as famous as his contemporaries , @entity60 , @entity228 or @entity229 , @entity44 was at the forefront of the @entity45 pop art movement			1
his furniture and the furore it provoked acted as a career - boost , raising his public profile			0
it certainly brought him financial success			0
an entire set of the furniture — six editions of each set of three were produced — was snapped up by @entity175 , the @entity176 playboy who was married to actress @entity243			0
in 2012 , @entity245 ’s art collection was auctioned at @entity246 , where the furniture set sold for £ 2.6 million , although @entity44 received only £ 10,000 in royalties			1
film - maker @entity249 was one of those very taken with the sculptures			0
years earlier , he ’d asked @entity253 to design some similar erotic ‘ furniture ’ for his film @entity255 , whose disturbing themes included violence against women			0
at first , @entity44 liked the idea but when it became clear @entity249 was expecting him to make the sculpture for free , he turned him down			2
undeterred , @entity249 got a set designer to produce tables for the film , using models of completely naked women			0
one critic described the movie as ‘ an intellectual ’s pornographic film ’			0
mr @entity44 , pictured with one of his canvas creations in the 1960s , was asked to make furniture for @entity249 's film @entity255 but turned him down @entity276 , art critic and editor of art magazine @entity278 , does n’t believe @entity44 ’s claim that the sculptures were some kind of ironic pro-feminist commentary on women ’s position in society			1
instead , he suggests that the cynical @entity44 deliberately set out to create a storm , particularly among feminists , in order to get noticed			2
nor does @entity276 believe the chair and its accompanying hat - stand and table can be seen as great art. @entity44 ’s entire oeuvre is , he says , ‘ fairly superficial , about t * * s , legs and bondage			1
[ it ’s ] based on half - naked bond - girl types			0
it makes me feel uneasy and squeamish			0
’ since his controversial heyday , @entity44 has become something of a grand old man of @entity45 art , organising exhibitions with @entity60 and bemoaning the failure to teach drawing properly			1
what does he make of the chair at the centre of the current controversy			0
is he flattered by @entity48 ’s ‘ homage ’ to his original ? far from it			1
he told a @entity313 interviewer he found it ‘ rather tacky and distasteful			2
i can only imagine that he [ @entity48 ] was going to get a lot of publicity , which unfortunately it has , for the wrong reasons			2
’ perhaps @entity48 was simply working on the principle that sex sells , and there ’s no such thing as bad publicity			2
as @entity44 himself discovered , 45 years ago			2
unimpressed : mr @entity44 , pictured in front of one of his paintings at the @entity329 in @entity109 in 2002 , described the ' homage ' to his work as ' tacky and distasteful '			1

@entity5 's girlfriend @entity26 was pictured in a chair made from a mannequin of a black woman on her back and legs in the air
the chair was designed by a @entity49 artist @entity48
it was based on an earlier 1969 piece by @entity45 artist @entity44
@entity44 was at the forefront of the @entity45 pop art movement but never as famous as his contemporaries , @entity60 , @entity228 or @entity229
he claims ' @entity351 ' was actually a protest against sexism
@entity44 described the latest ' homage ' to his work ' tacky and distasteful '
