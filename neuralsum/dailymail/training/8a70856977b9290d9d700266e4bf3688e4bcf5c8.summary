' these revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism , sexism , homophobia and antisemitism , and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and in wider society as a whole			0

but it is understood @entity9 dropped out of the running after @entity31 learned of the evidence that has been passed to @entity177 officials and on thursday morning @entity11 resigned as @entity31 ’s director of football following the revelations			1
' what you see at face value is not always reflective of the attitudes which are actually held deep down , ' added @entity4			2
' it 's easy to present yourself as being reasonable and fair , and to behave in ways that hide prejudice and bias			0
' however , any in - depth forensic examination or analysis of hidden views would be likely to reveal otherwise			0
that is what makes it difficult to eliminate and eradicate such prejudices , bigotry and even hatred			0

december 27 : @entity9 is eventually dismissed as @entity28 manager			1
the @entity257 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity9 ’s time at @entity28			1
in the course of a search by the @entity267 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity9 ’s employment at @entity28 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity275 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity275 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			2
that said , @entity275 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity17 process is complete			0
the @entity257 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity275 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			2
if @entity275 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity275 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity17 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity31			2
@entity275 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			2
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity275 ’s involvement in this matter			0
@entity275 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity275 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity275 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity17 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter			0

@entity9 and @entity11 are being investigated by the @entity17

a football official at another club is referred to as ‘ a gay snake ’ and ‘ the homo ’ and someone who is ‘ not to be trusted ’ , while a @entity392 player is someone ‘ who struck me as an *independently* minded young homo ’ .
an exchange with a young player who has a female agent makes reference to a sex act and states : ‘ i hope she ’s looking after your needs , ’ the player is then told . ‘ i bet you ’d love a bounce on her falsies . ’
on august 16 , 2012 , a list of players proposed by a @entity392 agent is forwarded , stating to @entity9 that ‘ he needs to rename his agency the @entity415 ’ . a separate text in reference to a list of @entity392 players states : ‘ not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering . ’
in a separate exchange a picture entitled ‘ @entity66 ’ is sent , with every square a ‘ @entity69 ’ square . of one @entity429 player , it is stated : ‘ does *n’t* look like a good *cv* . and he ’s @entity432 . ’
