social media has been flooded with hundreds of pages operated by sex workers , visible to any web user			1
while it has always been difficult to avoid adverts for prostitutes in sites such as phone boxes , the rise of social networking has made it even easier to access explicit content			2
shocking : so - called ' escort ' sites offering scantily clad women are freely available on @entity3 an investigation by @entity23 revealed that prostitutes and sex agencies openly solicit for customers on sites such as @entity3 and @entity28			1
the pages , which can be created by anyone and do not require approval by the sites ' management , provide details such as addresses , phone numbers , prices and the specific services			0
some are disguised as adverts for models or masseuses , but betray their true purpose with phrases such as : ' @entity45 can satisfy physically like no other provider can			0
' one was even offering a giveaway competition to win a free home session valued at £ 150			0
other adverts appeared to be searching for young women to work as prostitutes , promising they can ' earn about £ 9,000 a month and live in good apartments in @entity53 '			0
danger : the pages can be accessed by young @entity3 users and can not be automatically shut down @entity3 removed a number of the offending pages after the newspaper drew attention to them			1
however , the web giant headed by @entity62 admitted that it shuts down pages only if users of the site report them as being offensive			0
when @entity28 was alerted to adverts for prostitution on its site , it refused to remove them unless someone could prove a breach of the law had taken place			1

he told @entity23 that current legislation on prostitution was a ' swiss cheese ' which ' sends mixed messages '			0
police have previously been advised to monitor online advertising in order to crack down on sex trafficking , but they rarely take any action against individual sex workers or their clients			1
@entity3 is believed to be used by millions of @entity88 schoolchildren - although the official age limit is 13 , it is easy to circumvent the rules			2
child abuse expert @entity92 warned that social media posts about prostitution could be a ' gateway ' into paying for sex , as it encourages negative images of sexuality			2
@entity3 said in a statement : ' we encourage people ... to use the reporting tools on almost every page of the site so we can take swift action against content or behaviour that breaks our rules			2

sex workers advertise in publicly accessible posts
@entity28 refuses to remove adverts as @entity3 admits it can only act if users *complain* themselves
