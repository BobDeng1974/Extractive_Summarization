the cost to taxpayers of renovating the @entity2 and @entity3 of @entity6 ’s @entity5 residence is set to double to around £ 2million			2
bills for building work on @entity10 at @entity11 have spiralled and will eventually dwarf the £ 1.1million already spent , sources have revealed			1
royal aides are braced for criticism over the use of public money to turn the 20 - room , four - storey building into a new home for @entity18 , @entity3 and baby @entity19			1
new arrivals : @entity11 is being made ready for @entity18 , @entity3 and baby @entity21 to move in @entity23 : @entity11 , pictured last summer , is being renovated			0
@entity10 , a 20 - room complex , is being made ready for new arrivals questions have already been raised over the pair ’s luxurious lifestyle after they returned last week from a seven - day break in a five - star resort in the @entity30			1
prince @entity31 has denied that his organic garden at @entity33 is an ‘ expensive indulgence ’ – insisting that it helps to heal ‘ damaged souls ’			0
the money he has lavished on the @entity39 estate is a reaction to the ‘ carnage of fashionable vandalism ’ that has left once common shrubs , trees and farm animals on the endangered list			0
work such as planting unusual @entity48 apple varieties is attempting to repair ‘ appallingly short - sighted ’ damage to our soil , landscape and souls , he writes in the foreword to a new book			1
and it comes shortly after the @entity56 cast protocol aside during an engagement to say that the world ’s poor needed more help			0
although the @entity2 and @entity3 are paying for fixtures and items such as curtains and soft furnishings out of their own pockets , the cost of building work including new heating , electrics and plastering is being met by money given to the @entity56 by the government			2
so far the internal refurbishments have cost £ 600,000 and the renewal of the apartment ’s roof a further £ 400,000			2
another £ 100,000 has been spent on ‘ professional fees ’			1
but aides say work to renovate the apartment , which was once occupied by @entity80 , has far exceeded expectation			1
the initial budget was , according to one source , ‘ blown out of the water ’ by the discovery of asbestos – and the final bill ‘ is not likely to go down well ’ when the full details are revealed in june ’s annual royal finance report			2
primary residence : the extensive apartment in @entity11 , first estimated to cost £ 1.1million , will be the young family 's main residence grounds : apartment @entity10 is actually a spacious four - storey , 20 - room property with its own large south - facing walled garden a @entity11 spokesman said a close eye was being kept on costs but said roofwork was long overdue and blamed the asbestos for sending the bill skywards			1
earlier this month it emerged that @entity3 was having @entity10 redecorated at her own expense because she was unhappy with the colour scheme she had chosen while pregnant – apparently blaming her hormones			1
the spacious four - storey property takes up half the @entity110 wing designed by sir @entity111 for @entity18			0
' paid privately ' : some of the refurbishment costs are to come from the personal fortunes of the @entity2 and @entity3 living space once included five reception rooms , three main bedrooms , dressing rooms and bathrooms , a night and day nursery , nine staff bedrooms and ‘ ancillary ’ rooms			0
princess @entity80 herself spent £ 1.5million on refurbishment before moving in in 1963			1
in recent years the property has been used and managed by @entity125			0
as the charity has already spent its own money on remedial work , the @entity56 has compensated it for handing the building over to @entity18 and @entity3			2
developments : work is also being done on @entity132 in @entity133 , where vivid orange roof tiles were installed over the winter @entity135 : the 10 - room @entity137 home was given to @entity18 and @entity3 by the queen the cost , met by taxpayers but described by palace sources as ‘ fair ’ , it is understood to be more than £ 100,000			1

‘ looking after these buildings is the very thing the @entity150 is charged with doing , ’ said the aide			0
but @entity151 , of anti-monarchy group @entity152 , said : ‘ there is never a good time to be throwing our money at people who can afford to pay it themselves			0
’ sources say the @entity3 is already busy on her next project – the decoration of ten - bedroom @entity132 in @entity133 , given to them as a ‘ country residence ’ by the @entity56 last year .			0
