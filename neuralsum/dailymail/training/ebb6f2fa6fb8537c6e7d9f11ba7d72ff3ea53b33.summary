@entity0 believes @entity2 military plans to allow more women to serve closer to the front - line could compromise missions because men have ‘ protective emotions ’ towards the opposite sex			1
new @entity10 rules will continue preventing women from serving as infantry , armour and special operations forces - but they will formally allow them to serve in other jobs at the battalion level			1
however the @entity18 presidential candidate said it ’s natural for men to be protective when they see women in harm ’s way , which could cause them to lose focus on accomplishing a mission			1
‘ it ’s something that ’s natural that ’s very much in our culture to be protective			1
that ’s a concern with all the military			0
’ mr @entity0 told @entity60 on thursday that the idea is ‘ not in the best interests of men , women or the mission ’			1
he added on @entity49 that this is down to the ‘ natural inclination to want to protect someone ’			0
the former @entity37 senator said he believes women are capable of fighting alongside men in the heat of battle , but his concern is over how men would react to seeing women ‘ in harm ’s way ’			1
mr @entity0 has risen from a non-contender to a major candidate in little over a month , following his win in the first contest in @entity81 , and then in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 earlier this week			1
his campaign has seen a huge rise in donations after his impressive performance in the three states on tuesday and he told @entity49 ’s @entity90 that he is currently receiving around $ 1million every day			0
women at war : @entity94 sergeant @entity93 , of @entity95 , @entity96 , left , helps lance corporal @entity97 of @entity98 , @entity99 , put on her head scarf before heading out on a patrol in @entity102 , @entity103 a @entity105 poll now shows him tied for second place across the @entity2 with former house speaker @entity108 , although former @entity110 governor @entity109 remains slightly ahead of both			2
meanwhile mr @entity0 visited his sick three - year - old daughter @entity112 - who suffers from genetic disorder @entity114 and is currently fighting pneumonia - in hospital on thursday evening			2
‘ she ’s doing great , ’ he told @entity49			0
‘ she was on the mend when i ( last ) left ( her )			0
it was just so great to be home last night and get a chance to spend a lot of time with her and the rest of the kids			0
’ for the past decade women in the @entity2 military have served , fought and died on the battlefields in @entity128 and @entity103			2
but @entity10 rules were catching up a bit with reality on thursday			1
@entity132 has already propelled women to the front lines - often as medics , military police or intelligence officers - but they could n't be assigned as an infantryman in a unit going out on patrol			1
but they could fly the helicopter supporting the unit , or move in to provide medical aid if troops were injured			0
defence officials said the new rules will change that			2
they will formally allow women to be assigned to a battalion and serve in jobs such as medics , intelligence , police or communications officers , with the greatest effect on the @entity156 and @entity94			1
teamwork : @entity159 members @entity160 , right , sergeant @entity161 , centre , and corporal @entity163 , of @entity164 , @entity165 , wait to begin their patrol in @entity102 they ban women from more jobs than the @entity169 and @entity170 do - largely because of the infantry positions – but there long has been opposition to putting women in combat			1
' when you have men and women together in combat , i think men have emotions when you see a woman in harm ’s way ' @entity0 critics ask if they have the strength and stamina , or if their presence might hurt unit cohesion , and suggest @entity2 would be unhappy to see large numbers of women coming home in body bags			1
but the wars in @entity128 and @entity103 , where battlefield lines are blurred and insurgents can be around every corner , have made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat			2
thousands have served in the two wars , and more than 150 have been killed			0
but a 1994 combat exclusion policy bans women from being assigned to ground combat units below the brigade level			2
improving : @entity0 , pictured today with his family in @entity41 , has risen from a non-contender to a major candidate in little over a month to do battle with @entity108 and @entity109 father and child : @entity0 , left visited his sick three - year - old daughter @entity112 , right - who suffers from genetic disorder @entity114 and is currently fighting pneumonia - in hospital on thursday evening a brigade is roughly 3,500 troops , and is made up of battalions of about 800 soldiers			1
this means a woman serving as a communications or intelligence officer can be formally assigned to a brigade			0
' she ’s doing great			0
she was on the mend when i ( last ) left ( her )			0
it was just so great to be home last night and get a chance to spend a lot of time with her and the rest of the kids ' @entity0 on @entity237 , 3 but she ca n't be assigned to the smaller battalion			0
the military has got around this by ‘ attaching ’ women to battalions , meaning they could do the work without the credit for being in combat arms			2
while the new rules wo n't open up the @entity248 or the @entity156 @entity249 to women , former @entity2 defence secretary @entity246 said in 2010 that the military may eventually be open to that			1
admiral @entity252 , @entity253 chairman , said in november 2010 that ' large segments of women returning will have been exposed to some form of combat ' in @entity128 and @entity103			0
