@entity1 suggested newspapers should refuse to co-operate with a new @entity3 enshrining a newspaper watchdog			1
they should also mount a legal challenge to the way the government has handled the issue			1
the remarks by the planning minister , a member of the prime minister ’s inner circle , are by far the strongest criticism from a member of the government of a cross-party deal imposing a new system of regulation on the industry			1
mr @entity1 said of the @entity3 on press regulation , published last week : ‘ there ’s nothing we ’ve done that troubles me as much as this			1
’ he said the best argument culture secretary @entity35 could muster to justify it was that @entity37 and the @entity38 were threatening to join forces to push through something more draconian			2
mr @entity1 also launched a strong attack on his @entity43 colleagues , saying their stance was ‘ completely amazing ’ from a party that likes ‘ spouting guff about liberalism ’			1
he added : ‘ one of the strands that connects @entity50 , @entity51 and modern conservatives is freedom under the rule of law			2
we do not believe in freedom under the watchful eye and wagging finger of a state - sponsored regulator			0
’ the minister ’s remarks , in an interview with the @entity62 website , cast serious doubt on the future of the cross-party plan and suggest it does not command support at the top of government			2
the government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘ exemplary ’ damages in privacy and other cases			1
however , senior figures including @entity80 , an eminent @entity81 who is the architect of reforms to @entity85 ’s notorious libel laws , have suggested that will violate @entity87 , which protects freedom of expression			0
last week , the three main parties finally agreed the detail of a @entity3 setting up a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the @entity96 into media standards			1
' one of the strands that connects @entity50 , @entity51 and modern @entity100 is freedom under the rule of law			0
' we do not believe in freedom under the wagging finger of a state - sponsored regulator , ' @entity1 , planning minister an alternative proposal by the @entity107 , which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £ 1million , up - front corrections , with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently , and independence from the industry and politicians , was rejected			1
it is thought to be the first time that the @entity119 has been asked to sign a @entity3 imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry			1
mr @entity1 said that the strongest argument put by @entity124 was ‘ that if it did n’t go through , @entity37 and the @entity38 would do something much worse through explicit statutory legislation ’			1
he added : ‘ if you ask yourself a simple question “ would a @entity132 - only government be doing this ? ” , i think the answer is unquestionably “ no ”			0
’ he said the proposal ‘ does not compel any publisher of any news publication to co-operate with it			2
all it does is create this [ pressure to co-operate ] through the punitive damages			2
so there is absolutely no legal reason why any publisher needs to play along with it			2
’ mr @entity1 went on to suggest that the use of the @entity145 , a ministerial body which advises the @entity119 , and the royal prerogative to impose the regime was a ‘ pretty big constitutional innovation ’ and suggested the @entity107 should challenge it			1
he likened the use of the @entity145 and the royal prerogative to ‘ @entity153 ’			0
three out of four voters believe there is a risk that future governments would use a legal system of press regulation to try to stop newspapers from criticising them			2
a @entity162 poll for the @entity163 also found that 45 per cent agree it is vital that a free press is protected			0
he said it would be ‘ very reasonable ’ for the @entity107 to want to ‘ establish whether each and every one of the steps that has been undertaken to set up these structures has been properly undertaken ’			0
‘ this is a very , very big constitutional innovation , using a mechanism that is itself a pretty arcane piece of constitutional machinery			0
’ he added that by their behaviour over press freedom , the @entity38 have shown that they are not liberal			0
‘ what i find completely amazing is how they can carry on spouting guff about @entity179 and liberalism … while co-operating with statist @entity37 to try to bring in a much more draconian system of state regulation of the @entity107			0
’ the editor of the @entity184 has said she would ‘ probably not sign up ’ to a charter for state regulation			0
@entity187 , arguably the most powerful @entity107 figure outside the @entity85 , also said @entity190 journalists had more freedom than their counterparts here			0
‘ @entity107 in @entity85 has more restrictions on it than we do , ’ she told @entity194 ’s @entity193 .			0
