by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 24 may 2012 the @entity1 today wore a traditional floral dress to launch a very modern resource - a website made up of the journals of her great - great - grandmother @entity6			1
dressed in a high - necked turquoise and purple frock and pearls , the monarch used a remote control to reveal the site on a screen in @entity16 ’s throne room			2
more than 40,000 pages of the diaries kept by @entity1 @entity6 from the age of 13 until just before her death have been published			1
royal writings : the @entity1 launches an online collection of the private journals of @entity6 today , accompanied by curator of the @entity25 , lady @entity26 , at @entity16 you 're not seeing my diary ! the monarch meets bodleian librarian @entity31 during a reception to launch the @entity33 but the @entity1 provoked laughter when she commented , ' mine 's not being published			1
' the @entity35 , @entity36 at @entity37 and online publisher @entity38 scanned the pages - some in @entity6 ’s own hand and some edited and transcribed by her daughter @entity41 after her death - for the six - month project marking the @entity44			1
queen @entity6 wrote of the scenes that greeted her during a parade to mark her own 60 - year reign : ' passed through dense crowds , who gave me a most enthusiastic reception			1
it was like a triumphal entry			0
we passed down @entity54 , under a lovely arch bearing the motto , ‘ our hearts thy @entity58 ’			0
' the streets were beautifully decorated , also the balconies of the houses with flowers , flags , and draperies of every hue ... the streets , the windows , the roofs of the houses , were one mass of beaming faces , and the cheers never ceased			0
' new age : the @entity1 wore a floral dress and black courts to the event digitalising the diaries of @entity6 the @entity1 paid tribute to her forebear on the website , writing : ' in this the year of my @entity44 , i am delighted to be able to present , for the first time , the complete online collection of @entity1 @entity6 ’s journals from the @entity35			1
' these diaries cover the period from @entity1 @entity6 ’s childhood days to her accession to the throne , marriage to @entity92 , and later , her @entity93 and @entity44			1
' it seems fitting that the subject of the first major public release of material from the @entity35 is queen @entity6 , who was the first monarch to celebrate a @entity44			1
' interestingly , @entity6 wrote on her @entity44 about sending a message electronically			1
' i touched an electric button , by which i started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole @entity104 , ' she wrote			0
' it was the following : " from my heart i thank my beloved people , may @entity108 bless them			0
" ' the @entity110 account @ @entity111 will be active during the jubilee period			0
the online release of the diaries , which have been transcribed up to the year 1840 , mark the start of a year - long programme to digitise work from the @entity35			2
the queen was forced to rebuff bodleian librarian @entity31 when asked if she herself wrote a diary			2
dr @entity121 said it had been ' an amazing honour ' to work on the journals , which include sketches and paintings drawn by @entity6 to illustrate the books			2
she said : ' we have been motivated by the intrinsic value of these collections and the idea of sharing them			0
' it amplifies the excitement we have in having @entity1 herself come here , because it shows she has a real interest			0
' this is a part of history			0
it is such an exciting moment , when you can unlock history and make it publicly available			0
' the eyes of the world are focused on the @entity1 and the @entity44 - and this is the other @entity44			2

online resource made up of 40,000 pages written by the monarch
