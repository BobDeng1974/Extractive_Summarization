returning to @entity1 from orbit is no easy feat. to do so , spacecraft must endure temperatures of more than @entity5 as they hit the atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound			1
thankfully , over the years the technique has been refined to a tee ; astronauts can get from the @entity11 to the surface of @entity1 in just 3.5 hours			1
but a @entity13 has revealed the fiery process that takes place when the manned @entity17 spacecraft first comes into contact with the thick atmosphere - before it makes its daring descent back to @entity1			1
this is why the @entity11 has a crew of six			2
three people are taken there and back every six months , with crews of three overlapping with each other so that the same crew does n’t all depart at the same time			0
the @entity13 shows the moment the ablative heat shield of the @entity17 begins to bear the brunt of the temperatures of re-entry			1
on 23 november 2014 a @entity46 rocket blasted off to deliver three new crew members to the @entity11 - including @entity49 's first female astronaut			2
@entity50 , holding incoming station commander @entity51 , with the @entity53 space agency @entity52 , left the @entity54 in @entity55			0
also on board for the lift - off at 3am local time ( sunday 9pm gmt ) was @entity17 commander @entity59 , with the @entity60			2
ablative means that it ‘ burns up ’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe			2
but aside from a small amount of manouevring , there is not much for the astronauts to do during re-entry - except to sit and hope			2
' there 's not much an astronaut can do as their module re-enters @entity1 atmosphere but strap in , hold on tight and put their faith in years of proven science and technology , ' @entity80 , editor of @entity83 , told @entity84			1
' that can hardly be much consolation though : the temperature on the outside of their high speed spacecraft can be hot enough to melt iron due to friction with the @entity1 's atmosphere , while the effect of deceleration can be greater than seven times @entity1 gravity			1
' humans are better able to withstand g - forces perpendicular to the spine , which is why these astronauts are on their backs for re-entry			2
' the @entity17 ( shown ) is actually composed of three elements end - to - end - the @entity105 ( top left ) , the @entity106 ( middle ) and the instrumentation / propulsion module ( bottom right ) as it makes its way through the atmosphere ( shown ) , the capsule is subjected to intense temperature , which burn away the ablative heat shield on board - as it is designed to do			1
ablative means that it ‘ burns up ’ on re-entry to dissipate heat away from the cabin and keep the astronauts safe expedition 38 returned to @entity1 on 11 march 2014 ( shown ) in the snowy reaches of @entity122 , @entity55 after a six - month stay aboard the @entity11 here the three - man crew of the mission are seen on the ground after exiting from the @entity106			1
their journey back to @entity1 lasted about 3.5 hours in total the @entity17 is actually composed of three elements end - to - end - the @entity105 , the @entity106 and the instrumentation / propulsion module			1
the crew occupies the central part , while the other two are jettisoned before re-entry and burn up in the atmosphere			2
on their way to the station the @entity105 provides additional living space , and also contains the systems required to dock with the @entity11 , including a hatch and docking mechanism			0
the @entity108 , as its name might suggest , allows the spacecraft to rendezvous with the station after launch			0
on returning to @entity1 , it places the @entity17 into a deorbit burn , an angle of entry that will bring it back to @entity1 , before being jettisoned			1
however , in the @entity106 the crew also have a guidance , navigation and control system - so they do have some aspect of control when they have separated from the other two elements			0
conditions inside the module can be quite cramped			0
the astronauts have some degree of control over the spacecraft , but otherwise must trust the science and technology on board just a split second before landing , six solid - fueled soft - landing engines fire ( shown ) , dampening the impact by decreasing the speed to just 9.8ft ( three metres ) per second during the re-entry procedure , the @entity17 begins by undocking from the @entity11 and then performing a 15 - second separation burn			1
when it is 7.5 miles ( 12km ) behind the @entity11 , it begins the deorbit burn , which slows it down by about 375 feet ( 115 metres ) per second			0
then , three hours after undocking and just minutes from re-entry , it pyrotechnically separates the @entity105 and instrumentation / propulsion module			0
this begins the fiery entry process , during which the crew are unable to communicate with ground control			0
then , at a height of about 5.6 miles ( nine kilometres ) , a drogue chute slows the @entity17 from 785 to 295 feet ( 240 to 90 metres ) per second			0
the main chute then deploys at an altitude of 4.6 miles ( 7.5km ) , slowing the @entity17 to 20 feet ( six metres ) per second			0
next , the heat shield is jettisoned , exposing the underside of the spacecraft , which contains the landing engines			1
and finally , just a split second before landing , six solid - fueled soft - landing engines fire , dampening the impact by decreasing the speed to just three metres per second			0
shock abosrbers in the seats also dampen the landing for the astronauts on board , before the entry module hatch is opened and they climb out to the landing crew awaiting them .			0

the return of three astronauts to @entity1 is shown from inside @entity17 capsule
short clip reveals the capsule 's heat shield burning away
this shield is burnt on purpose to *protect* the astronauts inside
temperatures on re-entry reach @entity5 ( 3,000 ° f ) as the spacecraft hits the atmosphere at 25 times the speed of sound
the journey time from the @entity11 to @entity1 takes a total of 3.5 hours
