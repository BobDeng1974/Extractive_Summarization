@entity0 has insisted there is no @entity3 crisis for @entity5 clubs despite a second year out of three with no representatives in the last eight of the @entity8 â€“ but he does believe it is time to change the away - goals rule			1
@entity11 and @entity12 both crashed out of the competition on away goals in the first knockout stage , beaten by @entity16 and @entity17 respectively			1
@entity0 , however , has long championed a change to the rule			1
@entity11 crashed out of the @entity8 on away goals despite beating @entity16 on tuesday @entity16 scored three away goals at the @entity21 which proved to be the difference in the tie if at the end of two - legged tie the score is level , the team that has scored the most goals away from home is declared the winner			1
for example , @entity16 beat @entity11 3 - 1 away from home before losing 2 - 0 in @entity33			1
with the score tied at 3 - 3 , @entity16 progressed courtesy of having scored on more goal on their travels			1
' that 's a rule that 's outdated now and should be changed , ' the @entity11 boss said			1
' it should count maybe after extra-time			2
it was created in the 1960s to get teams to attack away from home			2
' since then football has changed and the weight of the away goals is too big today			1
maybe count it after extra-time like in the @entity52 in @entity5			1
' i think the quality of @entity55 is high and physical demands are extreme but i 'm not in the mood to analyse too much what 's wrong with @entity5 football			1
i do n't think there 's a lot wrong			2
' @entity0 must pick up his players ahead of saturday 's game at @entity64 as the battle for a top - four finish in the @entity55 continues			1
he added : ' the mood is down and we are disappointed			2
the tie lasted 180 minutes and we were not cautious enough in the first 90			2
we know why we went out , it 's down to a dreadful defensive performance in the first leg			2
@entity11 boss @entity0 wants the away - goals rule changed in @entity3 competition @entity75 were the third @entity5 club to be knocked out at the last - 16 stage after they lost to @entity77 ' we must focus on next targets and we have to continue to improve			1
we are better today than four months ago			0
' let 's keep that attitude			0
there 's a fantastic spirit and great quality			0
let 's rectify what we did n't do well in first game and continue to improve			0
' we 've won 13 of the last 15 and that 's down to quality and improvement			0
we are not in a transfer period			0
ninety - five per cent of the players will still be here next season and what is important is their attitude and improvement			2
we are in the semi-finals of the @entity99 , and in a strong fight in the @entity55			0
we can do that straight away on saturday			0
' we 're on a good run			0
we won the game in @entity16			0
we 're frustrated and disappointed to go out but that 's down to our home performance especially on the defensive front			0
we were a bit unlucky as well			0
if you look at shots on target by @entity16 in the two games they 've been quite efficient			0
