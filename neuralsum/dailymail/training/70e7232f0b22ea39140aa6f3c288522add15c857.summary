by @entity0 embarrassment : @entity1 campaigning with @entity2 in @entity3 @entity1 's local crime tsar has been accused of setting up a sham office in a ‘ cynical scam ’ that increased his travel expenses by 6,000 per cent , @entity9 can reveal			1
@entity2 , the conservative police and crime commissioner for @entity11 , could not claim for the cost of the 45 - minute drive from his home to the force ’s headquarters every morning			1
he changed his main office to a single room in a police station just four miles from his house			0
it meant mr @entity2 could then receive expenses for every journey he made to the police @entity24 , after briefly checking in at the smaller office			1
in the first few weeks after the move he clocked up over 1,000 miles and was paid more than £ 450 of public money – a 6,181 per cent rise on the £ 7 he received the previous month			0
and in a further twist , mr @entity2 has now become the first @entity33 to appoint a chauffeur to ferry him back and forth to work			1
it means his mileage claims have ceased but it will cost taxpayers at least £ 20,000 a year for him to be driven around in an @entity40			1
at the same time , @entity41 must make £ 40 million of cuts over the next four years			0
last night there was astonishment at the behaviour of mr @entity2 , who is paid £ 85,000 as @entity33 and £ 15,000 in allowances as a @entity49 councillor			1
it is yet another embarrassment for mr @entity1 , mp for @entity3 , @entity52 , and for the @entity49 ’ flagship law and order policy of electing 41 commissioners across @entity55 and @entity56 , to make the police more accountable			0
four miles away : @entity2 drove from his home in @entity59 , @entity60 to his local station @entity62 , chief executive of the @entity63 ’ @entity64 , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s pop - up office appears to be part of a cynical scam to milk the system for as much cash as possible			1
’ @entity70 , a @entity71 town councillor , added : ‘ i am very curious as to how him having these two offices benefits the @entity11 public			2
’ mr @entity2 lives in the upmarket village of @entity59 , @entity60			1
but his 13 staff are based at the @entity24 in @entity76 , @entity77 , a 37 - mile journey that takes 45 minutes along the busy @entity79			0
because @entity81 rules do not allow employees to claim business mileage between home and their main place of work , mr @entity2 initially had to cover the cost of his commute			2
@entity89 office : @entity2 used to briefly check in at @entity91 records on his website show he was paid just £ 15.30 in mileage expenses last december , his first month in charge			1
in january he claimed £ 7.20 for driving 16 miles , at 45p a mile			0
but a footnote says he then opened an office in @entity91 , just down the road from his home			0
it explains : ‘ therefore his main place of work is now @entity91 with a home - to - work mileage of nine			0
’ under the new arrangement , mr @entity2 claimed back the cost of 13 return journeys to @entity76 in his own car , after first checking in at @entity91			1
his mileage claim shot up to 1,005 in february , for which he was paid £ 452.25 , and in march it went up again to 1,334 , for which he received £ 600.30			0
real office : @entity2 then drove to the @entity112 in @entity76 , allowing him to claim mileage on the second journey no need to drive : @entity116 is now chauffeur - driven in an @entity117 it takes six minutes to complete the journey from his house to the small , red - brick station in @entity91 , which is open to the public just four hours a day , three days a week			1
when @entity9 visited , the front counter was manned by one civilian worker and there was no sign of mr @entity2			2
in the reception area next to the front door , an @entity128 piece of paper bearing his name has been stuck on a door with drawing pins			0
but in april , he stopped using the @entity91 office after acquiring a chauffeur			0
he is now taken in one of the force ’s own @entity117 saloons directly from his home to @entity76			2
he advertised on the @entity41 website for a ‘ support officer ’ on at least £ 19,700 a year whose main roles would be providing ‘ driving and practical support ’			1
@entity146 mp , @entity147 ’s @entity146 , said : ‘ the @entity33 needs to immediately explain the need for this expenditure , and why he initially opened a temporary office close to his home			2
‘ this is another example of potentially increased costs which are taking away money from policing the front line at a time when the number of police officers is being cut			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 said : ‘ @entity11 is a large area to cover and the @entity91 office was made available to the @entity33 to increase his productivity			1
the @entity33 has recently employed a support officer whose role includes administrative support for the @entity33			2
the decision was also taken to make driving duties one of the responsibilities of this post			0
' the @entity33 has had the use of a surplus force fleet car since april and therefore has not submitted any mileage claims since then			2
’ since publication of this article we have been asked to make clear that mr @entity2 had intended to use the @entity91 office as his permanent place of work			2
the audit report did not conclude it was a “ sham ” office			0
in addition , we confirm that the support officer / driver , was part - time with a salary of £ 11,980			0
mr @entity2 has also clarified that he stood down as executive member of @entity185 prior to becoming @entity33 , and now receives the basic allowance of £ 6,149 rather than £ 15,000 as reported .			1
