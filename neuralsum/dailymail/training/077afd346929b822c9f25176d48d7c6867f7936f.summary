the sensational innings on a batsman - friendly @entity7 came off 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes , and only ended on the last ball of @entity14 's innings as @entity0 holed out in the deep			1
@entity0 said he was ' ready to bat another 50 overs ' after walking off the @entity16 with his side on a formidable 404 for five after winning the toss and batting first			1
his score alone would have won the match by 13 runs after the visitors were all out in the 44th over for 251			2
@entity14 's @entity0 hit 264 from 173 balls against @entity5 for the highest ever @entity24 score on thursday @entity5 were made to pay for dropping the destructive 27 - year - old in the fifth over with his tally just four runs at the time			1
@entity0 's innings demolishes @entity31 's previous record of a 149 - ball 219 against the @entity32 in 2011			1
@entity0 also has the third top score in @entity24 with his 209 off 158 balls against @entity35 in november last year			1
@entity0 's knock got off to a modest start with the opener reaching his hundred in even time , with his first 50 off 72 balls and his second 50 in a swift 28 deliveries			1
from then it was a procession for the right - hander			0
his third 50 took 25 balls and the 50 up to his 200 took just 26 deliveries			0
with the end in sight , and @entity0 looking to cash in knowing 350 is an achievable target at this ground , he reached 250 in a further 15 balls			2

that made me stay there as long as possible , ' @entity0 said on @entity82			0
' it is important to look at the team score as that is how you build an innings			0
' had opening bowler @entity88 been given his full allocation of 10 overs he could have made a century of his own after going for 89 runs off nine overs at a rate of 9.88			0
his only consolation was that it was off his bowling that @entity0 's wicket fell , with the rampant 27 - year - old finding the safe hands of @entity98 instead of the middle of his bat			1
coming into this match , @entity0 had scored 142 for an @entity14 a side ina warm - up against the @entity104 - his last knock before that was in august against @entity68 in @entity107 where he injured his hand			2
@entity31 and @entity56 are the only other players to have reached 200 in an odi			2
one record @entity0 fell short of was for the highest score for a limited - overs match , falling a single shot along the ground short of @entity116 's 268 for @entity117 in 2002			2
@entity14 got off to the perfect start with the ball , removing @entity104 opener @entity120 without scoring with the third ball of their first over			0
despite a mid-innings fightback from @entity126 ( 75 ) and @entity127 ( 59 ) the target proved a task too great and @entity14 took a 4 - 0 series lead with one match remaining			0
