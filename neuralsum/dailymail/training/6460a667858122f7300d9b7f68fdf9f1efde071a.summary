by @entity1 reporter published : 13:50 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 14:47 est , 29 june 2012 ruling : former @entity3 presenter @entity2 has lost her employment tribunal against @entity5 a presenter on morning tv show @entity3 who claimed she was bullied by her boss following an ectopic pregnancy has lost her sex discrimination claim			1
@entity2 , 36 , alleged she returned from sick leave last august to be told by @entity3 boss @entity12 , who was once married to the show 's main presenter @entity13 , that she had been overlooked for the job of pool producer on the show			1
she claimed mr @entity12 began a meeting between the two of them by saying ' i hope you do n’t think your ectopic pregnancy had anything to do with not getting the job ' before behaving in a ' belligerent , rude and aggressive ' manner			1
@entity3 admitted they had treated her unfairly by not advertising the role and choosing a candidate who had recently applied for another producer job			1
however , miss @entity30 lost her claim for sexual discrimination after an employment tribunal ruled that although the recruitment process was unfair , it did not have anything to with her gender or pregnancy			1
giving evidence earlier in the hearing mr @entity12 , who no longer works on the breakfast show , said the post had to be filled quickly as that was the nature of tv and he did not think miss @entity30 was interested in the role as her main ambition was to be a reporter			2
he claimed he was ‘ hurt , shocked and appalled ’ by the allegations against him and said he had always been ‘ completely supportive ’ of @entity30 and was saddened when he heard about her loss			2
miss @entity30 had argued that she had been convinced she would be offered the job of pool producer , after covering it during someone else 's maternity leave			2
she told the hearing mr @entity12 had praised her work in the past and told her she was ' very good ' at her job			1
but after returning to work after taking time off to recover from her miscarriage , ms @entity2 was told that to be eligible for the job , she must have already applied for a day producer job , which involved 23 hour shifts and sleeping in the studio one night a week			1
she added it was a ' ridiculous suggestion ' that she should apply for a job she did not want in the hope in of being offeredone that she did want			2
she told the tribunal in @entity75 that at their meeting mr @entity12 steadfastly refused to re-advertise the position and told her he had assumed she did not want it since she did not apply for the @entity80 producer role			2
she said : ' he kept telling me what ’s done is done and they would not re-advertise the role or consider other candidates			2
' she said : ' i believe his exclusion of me was deliberate and the exclusion of others who may or may not have applied was a by - product			2
accusations : ms @entity2 's former boss , @entity12 , who was accused of threatening and bullying behaviour , is the former husband of @entity13 allegation : ms @entity2 claimed she was passed over for a promotion after taking time off work because of an ectopic pregnancy ' i believe it was on the basis of my ectopic pregnancy because i can not think of anything else he would be able to complain about			1
' after the fiery september meeting ms @entity2 said she had cried in the toilet before facing her colleagues in the newsroom			1
mr @entity12 himself has since left @entity5 after network bosses accepted his resignation given the failure of @entity3 to attract an audience			0
he told the tribunal : ' as a husband and father , my wife and i have been through various good and bad experiences in pregnancy			0
' my first and only reaction was of sadness for @entity2 and full support for her			1
' in all similar matters i ’ve acted in a way i would expect any manager to treat my wife			0
' in every circumstance where female workers have told me they are pregnant i have always been happy for them and told them of my own experiences			0
' they should take great care to look after themselves , with work being far less important that their health and the health of their child			1
' @entity2 seemed to appreciate the support i had given her and she certainly did not raise any complaint with me at that time that i was not being supportive			1
' he married ms @entity13 1998			0
they divorced in april 2002			0
on camera : ms @entity2 was convinced she would be offered a producer role after impressing bosses , and believes she was overlooked because of her miscarriage still employed by @entity5 : ms @entity2 has taken on a presenter / producer role elsewhere at the network @entity142 , representing @entity5 , said ms @entity2 had completely misrepresented the meeting with mr @entity12 and she entered the meeting in an ' agitated state '			1
under cross-examination he read from emails where mr @entity12 was ' sympathetic and kind ' on learning about her miscarriage			1
delivering the panels judgment , employment judge @entity148 said they accepted mr @entity12 ’s evidence was a ‘ reasonable explanation ’ for what he did			0
mr @entity148 added : ' he was misguided , that is accepted			0
it is not in dispute that what occurred was far from being best practise in accordance with the @entity162 and @entity161 code or the company ’s equal opportunities policy			0
' however , what occurred had nothing to do with the claimant ’s pregnancy or her gender			0
' it may have been unfair , it may have been unreasonable , but we find it was not in breach of the @entity175			0
' miss @entity30 , a former @entity179 reporter , has since accepted a £ 37,000 a year role with @entity5 as a reporter / producer after being offered the job following the grievance process			0
she looked upset and declined to comment after hearing the judgment			0
representatives for @entity3 also refused to comment on the outcome .			0
