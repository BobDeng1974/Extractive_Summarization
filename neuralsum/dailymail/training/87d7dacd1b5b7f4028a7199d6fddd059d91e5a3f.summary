there will be the usual fanfare on saturday when @entity2 wins his 100th @entity4 cap			1
but whilst it ’s obviously a source of pride , it is nothing to shout about , and deep down he knows that			0
i ’m a big @entity2 fan – regular readers of this column will be well aware of that			1
i have never questioned his passion to play for @entity4 , even when he has sometimes channelled that desire in a counter-productive way ( abusing the fans in @entity16 , getting sent off in @entity17 )			2
@entity4 captain @entity2 gestures during the friendly against @entity19 at @entity20 back in september @entity4 captain @entity2 returned to his first school ahead of his 100th cap			1

of course you have to be a very good player to play a century of games for @entity4			2
but is it something to celebrate ? @entity2 has been a regular for his country in an era when @entity4 have been desperate for strikers			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and a fast - fading @entity38 have all won international caps in the @entity2 era			1
had @entity2 played in the mid- 1990s he might not have reached 100 caps			2
he would have been competing with the likes of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
@entity38 pictured in action for @entity4 against the @entity50 at the @entity51 in @entity16 @entity37 misses a chance to score for @entity4 in the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity54 in a friendly in 2009 so a dearth of strikers over the past 10 years has helped @entity2 ’s total , without doubt			1
but @entity2 is on the verge of breaking the all - time scoring record for @entity4 , and his international quality can not be questioned			1
until you get to tournament football			1
@entity2 will be well aware how atrocious his record is at @entity68 – three of them , only one goal			0
@entity71 are better : two tournaments , five goals			0
but four of them were back in 2004			0
@entity43 scores @entity4 's second goal in their 4 - 1 victory against @entity77 at @entity78 @entity48 slides the ball home to score his only goal for @entity4 in a 3 - 1 victory against @entity83 in 2001 on the face of it 100 caps is an achievement			2
breaking the scoring record for @entity4 will be something for @entity2 to cherish , if and when it happens			1
but i know how passionate this guy is when it comes to representing his country			0
and i suspect he would trade some of the caps and goals if it meant he could lead @entity4 to victory in @entity100 in 2016 , or even @entity101 in 2018			0
some players have represented their country very well – in the modern era @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity2 all spring to mind			2
they ’ve all won a ton of caps			0
@entity2 ( centre ) shows his dejection after @entity112 scored the winner in their 2 - 1 @entity115 victory in june @entity2 celebrates after scoring @entity4 's sole goal in a 1 - 0 friendly victory against @entity19 in september is it too harsh for me to declare my belief that , regardless of caps and goals , an @entity4 international ’s career can be respected , but must be considered a failure without a major tournament victory ? is n’t that what they ’re all aiming for ? @entity2 ’s dream of such glory is still alive and i hope he goes for it			1
be proud to represent your country 100 times but remember that is n’t the goal			0
lifting a major trophy is what it ’s all about .			0
