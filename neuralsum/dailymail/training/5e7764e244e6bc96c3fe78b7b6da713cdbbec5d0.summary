by @entity0 published : 15:17 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 15:17 est , 5 march 2014 the @entity2 voted on tuesday to ban the use of electronic cigarettes , also known as ' vaping ' ' from restaurants , bars , nightclubs and other public spaces in the nation 's second - largest city			1
a spokeswoman for mayor @entity13 said that he would sign the measure into law in the coming days			0
when he does , @entity16 will join a growing list of cities , including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , that restrict the use of e-cigarettes , which are battery - powered cartridges filled with liquid nicotine that creates an inhalable vapor when heated			1
public health experts fear that vaping , which has recently gained popularity among teens and young adults , may serve as a gateway to smoking for the uninitiated			1
critics also point to potential harm posed from second - hand vapor from e-cigarettes , saying too little is known about the effects of the chemicals contained in the cartridges			1
' we have an obligation to protect the workforce from the effects of secondhand aerosol exhaled by people who choose to ' vape ' on e-cigarettes , ' said city council member @entity57 , who co-sponsored the proposal			2
' we also have a responsibility to protect our youth and everyone else in public places from the carcinogens found in the ultra-fine particles in e-cigarette aerosol , ' he said			2
the proposal was opposed by the makers of e-cigarettes , who pitch their product as a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes and say there is no evidence that second - hand vape smoke is harmful			1
advocates of e-cigarettes also say they can help smokers kick the habit			0
the @entity16 ban differs from restrictions in other major cities in that it was amended to allow vaping in lounges and e-cigarette stores and for filming or theatrical purposes			0
e-cigarettes contain no tobacco , but that has not stopped lawmakers from banning them even in workplaces ' although we believe the final decision was made in the absence of credible science , it was a more reasonable and sensible approach than the original proposal , ' @entity91 , the largest independent maker of e-cigarettes , said in a written statement			1
' @entity91 remains concerned , however , that banning e-cigarette use in public places could deter current tobacco smokers from using the products and thus disserves public health , ' the company said			1
the @entity2 action comes as the @entity108 government is contemplating further regulations at the national level			2
the @entity111 has already proposed a rule that would bring e-cigarettes under its jurisdiction and could potentially require companies to register and pay fees , list the ingredients in their products , obtain approval for new products and restrict online sales and marketing to children			0
a law passed in 2009 gave the @entity111 the authority to regulate cigarettes , smokeless tobacco and roll - your - own tobacco			2
it also gave the agency the power to deem other tobacco products to be within its jurisdiction , but it must first issue a rule to that effect			0
e-cigarette companies believe they should be exempt from the full spectrum of regulations , saying that would stifle innovation , damage small business and hurt consumers trying to quit smoking			0
tobacco company @entity144 , the owner of the blu e-cigarette brand , is the dominant player in the field , followed by privately held @entity91 and @entity149			0
the three account for an estimated 80 percent of the market .			0

health risks of ' vaping ' compared to regular smoking are still *unclear* but could still be harmful
electronic cigarettes are battery - powered cartridges with liquid nicotine and contain no tobacco
@entity2 bans use of e-cigarettes in public spaces such as bars , nightclubs , parks , restaurants , and workplaces
