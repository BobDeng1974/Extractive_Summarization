the severity of @entity2 's current drought has been realized by the release of two @entity5 pictures of @entity6 and the desolation it has suffered in just two and a half years			1
the reservoir , located northeast of @entity2 , @entity2 , can be seen almost full on july 20 , 2011 , measuring a capacity of 97 percent			1
but in a shot taken just last month , the lake had a capacity of just 17 percent			1
the devastating images have added to the need for the west coast to better manage its water resources , with the record drought forcing a state of emergency and @entity5 now working to help the crisis			1
water deliveries to 750,000 acres of farmland and 25 million people have been halted , with the carryover water from last year that is in reservoirs to be channeled to the farmers and several towns that get their water from the @entity50			0
furthermore homeowners are drilling thousands of wells to pump water from aquifers that are historically depleted			0
last week gov. @entity55 unveiled a proposed $ 687.4 - million drought - relief package to free up water supplies and aid @entity22 facing financial ruin because of the prolonged dry spell			1
the proposal would provide millions of dollars to clean up drinking water , improve conservation and make irrigation systems more efficient			0
it would also increase penalties for those who illegally divert water and provide emergency food and housing			0
but the package plan came after farmers faced the driest year in more than a century			0
farmers in @entity2 ’s @entity74 , the world ’s most productive agricultural region , will get none of the water they requested this year from a federally controlled system because of the drought			2
the @entity82 @entity81 ’s @entity80 said last week it wo n’t be able to deliver any of the more than 2.4 million acre - feet of water sought by farmers , according to @entity86			2
a state - controlled system last month said it , too , would n’t be able to deliver any of the 4 million acre - feet of water sought by local agencies the result will hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland die , boosting food prices across the @entity82 and leaving farm workers jobless			2
parched : water levels for many of @entity2 's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping ; concern is mounting that @entity2 may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s , or even worse , 1977 president @entity102 tours a local farm that has been affected by drought on february 14 , 2014 , with @entity22 gov. @entity55 ( left ) , @entity106 , @entity107 ( right ) and @entity108 , @entity107 dry year : governor @entity55 holds a chart showing statewide average precipitation as he speaks during a news conference in @entity112 after declaring a drought state of emergency for @entity2 docks float on extremely low - level water in @entity116 on february 5 , 2014 near @entity117 , @entity2			1
about 17 rural communities could run out of drinking water within several weeks and politicians are are pushing to undo laws that protect several endangered species the @entity123 has now partnered with @entity5 to use the space agency 's satellite data and other airborne technology to better measure the snowpack , groundwater levels and predict storms			1
' it sounds like a cliche , but if they could put a man on the moon , why ca n't we get better seasonal forecasting ? ' @entity137 of the state 's @entity123 said in an interview following the @entity2 announcement of the partnership			1
@entity5 scientists said they are also embarking on projects that use satellite images to help more accurately measure the number of fields farmers have chosen not to plant and where land is sinking because of excessive ground - water pumping			2
gov. @entity55 directed state officials to form such partnerships as part of his drought emergency declaration			1
@entity2 's relationship with @entity5 began shortly after the dry year of 2009 , when officials sought answers to problems exacerbated by the lack of rain and snow , such as the sinking land			2
year 's drought has made that research all more important , @entity164 said , adding that the preliminary findings proved that there 's plenty more to learn			0
@entity5 geologist @entity168 said that bringing together all types of research and modern technology like pieces of a puzzle may help those in charge of managing the state 's water supply avoid deficit water years like this			1
@entity6 is so dry that truck tires and other debris from the bottom of the dam can be seen parched : a warning buoy sits on the dry , cracked bed of @entity185 near @entity186 , @entity22 despite recent spot rains the reservoir is currently only about 37 percent full almond farmer @entity189 of @entity190 had 1,000 acres - 20 percent - of his almond trees removed because he does n't have access to enough water a sign is posted near an almond farm in @entity196 , @entity2 rows of uprooted almond trees lay on the ground before being shredded at @entity190 on february 25 , 2014 in @entity200 ' we 're on the verge of being able to put all these measurements together and start looking at the concept of closing the water budget of @entity2 , ' he said			1
@entity207 , director of @entity5 's @entity208 , said that 13 of the agency 's satellites are focused on water			0
three more water research projects are scheduled by @entity5 , including a satellite to be launched feb. 27 with the @entity214			0
projects @entity5 is advancing include measuring so - called " atmospheric rivers " to better predict global storm systems farther in advance so rain can be captured in @entity2 reservoirs			1
satellite images that show the amount of land farmers have chosen not to plant in a drought will arm officials in @entity2 with information about where to open food banks for farm workers			2
satellites technology will help officials identify levees that are prone to break with high volumes of water , scientists said			0
as @entity238 , senior policy analyst with the @entity239 ( @entity239 ) , explains , metropolitan cities like @entity236 , @entity112 and @entity237 have been largely unnafectted because they started developing ways to catch and retain water following the drought from 1987 to 1992			0
in 2003 , @entity2 signed onto a new water - sharing agreement that included ' the largest transfer of water from agricultural use to urban use in @entity82 history , ' according to the @entity249			0
' @entity2 cities really got their act together and began coming up with formal drought plans two decades ago , ' says @entity253 , @entity249 executive director			0
' now , they ’re reaping the benefits of that planning			0
' @entity2 is under the influence of a persistent upper - level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm , dry and @entity262 four miles high and 2,000 miles long , is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity267 winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched @entity270 mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity267 winter storms from coming ashore in @entity2 , pushing them into @entity274 and @entity275 - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the @entity279 high - pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters , but they usually break down , allowing rain to get through to @entity283 duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the ' ridiculously resilient ridge			1
' source : @entity289 - @entity288 a dead almond crop is seen in @entity2 's @entity291 in @entity292 , one of the many agricultural industries to be hit badly the @entity82 @entity80 officials announced they will not be providing @entity74 farmers with any water from the federally run system of reservoirs and canals fed by mountain runoff			0

@entity303 , northeast of @entity2 , has lost 80 percent of its water capacity in 2.5 years
pictures released by @entity5 this week show the dam almost full in 2011 with a capacity of 97 percent
today it stands at 17 percent
@entity6 is so low the remains of a @entity314 - era ghost town - which was *flooded* to create the lake in the 1950s - are *visible* for the first time in years
governor @entity55 has declared a drought emergency , seeking federal aid as water drops dangerously low and proposing a $ 687.4 million relief package
ten rural communities have fewer than 60 days ' supply of water
@entity5 is now working with the @entity123 to help the state manage its water resources
