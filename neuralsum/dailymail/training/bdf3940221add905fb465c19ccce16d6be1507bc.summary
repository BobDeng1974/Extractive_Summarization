there was a rueful look on @entity3 ’s face as he emerged from the medical examinations which followed his brutally heroic defeat by the heir apparent to @entity7 and @entity8 as boxing ’s pound for pound king			1
here , in the plush surroundings of @entity12 , stood the second best middleweight on the planet but still with no world championship belt around his waist			0
@entity18 men have held one of those titles but for the third time the hard man from @entity21 ’s had come up short			0
@entity24 connects with a brutal right jab as @entity3 feels the force of the unbeaten @entity27 @entity3 was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant @entity24 but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round @entity24 grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32 - year - old , who successfully defended his middleweight title once more 1 ) @entity7 2 ) @entity8 3 ) @entity37 4 ) @entity24 5 ) @entity38 6 ) @entity39 7 ) @entity40 8 ) @entity41 9 ) @entity42 10 ) @entity43 once again there was no shame in losing , on this occasion to the phenomenal @entity24			1
yet again the demeanour was reminiscent of @entity49 great @entity48 whenever he was told that he was the best tennis player never to win @entity50			2
that is a back - handed distinction which @entity3 remains determined to purge from his resume			1
‘ @entity24 is a terrific boxer , ’ he acknowledged			1
‘ but i believe that if i fought like this against any of the other belt - holders i would have won			0
‘ i have to keep going			0
’ there can be a badge of honour in defeat and @entity3 wore his in the livid scars , purple weals and black bruises on his face			2
he was clutching one small but worthy victory , that of extending @entity24 @entity65 as far as the 11th round for the first time in a career littered with the fallen bodies of his opponents			1
@entity24 is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound - for - pound fighter on the planet @entity24 is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet @entity80 claps as @entity24 clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop @entity3 in the 11th unlike many of his predecessors , @entity3 kept getting up after being floored by the most destructive pound - for - pound puncher in the prize - ring			1
he had never been knocked down before but he dealt with the shock with typical courage			0
when he did so for the fourth time , after the most devastating blow of all , referee @entity89 wisely decreed that he need take no further punishment			0
that intervention may well have saved @entity3 to fight another day			1
@entity24 has ended the careers of several of his challengers and any more of those thunderous punches might have done the same to @entity3			1
much as would have objected , his corner should have pulled out a little earlier			0
the problem for @entity3 is that the strength , determination and no little skill which he brought to this challenge may make it as difficult for him to find opponents as it is for @entity24			1
the @entity27 whose 29th victory inside the distance in 32 fights now gives him the highest knock - out ratio in middleweight history is finding unification fights against alternative belt wearers hard to come by			0
@entity112 is one who is no hurry to meet @entity24 in the ring			2
nor is he showing much enthusiasm for giving @entity3 his fourth title shot			2
the @entity12 crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from @entity3 and unstoppable power and precision from @entity24 it may be that the man from @entity21 ’s , who is big for a middleweight , should move up to the super-middle division in which there are more big - money matches to be made			1
for the time being he will probably focus on pursuing whoever emerges from the winner of @entity132 and @entity133 versus @entity134			0
‘ i ’ve always wanted to clean up against the other domestic fighters , ’ he says , ‘ but at this stage whoever i can get i need it to be in big fights			0
’ they wo n’t come any bigger than @entity24			2
@entity3 has protested about the draw which robbed him in his first title shot against @entity143			2
he believes he would have been given the decision against @entity145 had the fight not take place in @entity148			0
but there were no complaints this time			0
@entity3 showed the matured and reformed aspect of his nature when he said : ‘ it was an honour to be in the ring with someone as good as @entity156			2
not only did i feel his power but he kept coming so hard and fast that it was impossible to keep him off me			0
’ the maestro returned the compliment : ‘ it was not a surprise that he lasted to the 11th round			1
@entity3 is a good boxer , one of my toughest opponents and a very brave man			1

@entity3 *'s* fight was stopped in the 11th round by referee
@entity24 remains *undefeated* after win against @entity3
@entity3 *heaped* *praise* on ' terrific boxer ' @entity24 after fight
