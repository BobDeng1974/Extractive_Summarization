@entity0 has told the @entity1 that booing @entity2 will have zero impact on the winger ’s performance for @entity6			1
@entity7 stated last week that it was okay for fans to boo @entity2 and @entity10 – both born and raised in @entity11 – as long as it was purely on footballing grounds			1
@entity14 then went much further , claiming the pair deserved a ‘ horrible reception ’ for deciding to represent the land of their grandparents			1
@entity20 and @entity6 winger @entity2 was born and raised in @entity11 @entity10 is a major injury doubt for friday ’s @entity23 showdown at @entity24 but @entity2 seems certain to be part of @entity27 ’s starting line - up - and the @entity6 boss has no doubt the 28 - year - old will handle any flak sent in his direction			1
‘ he ( @entity2 ) has chosen to play for @entity6 , which is his prerogative , ’ said o ’ @entity33			1
‘ at the time he chose , i may well have been his manager at @entity37			2
i have to say now that , although at the time i had absolutely nothing to do with his decision , i am absolutely delighted he chose to follow his forefathers from @entity45			0
‘ remember that while the game is being played at @entity24 it will not be made up necessarily all of @entity37 - chanting supporters			2
[ booing or cheering ] is the prerogative of fans to choose			2
but i do n’t think it would have an impact on such a precocious kid			0
‘ it ’s natural you would prefer people to applaud a piece of brilliance , rather than booing it , but he ’s gained experience now and at the age he ’s at i think he ’ll take this in his stride			0
’ @entity10 is a major injury doubt for friday ’s @entity23 showdown at @entity24 @entity10 will be assessed before the squad trains in @entity68 this morning after sustaining a hamstring problem playing for @entity20 on sunday , with @entity27 drafting in @entity71 ’s @entity70 to bolster his options in midfield			1
@entity71 centre - back @entity74 and back - up goalkeeper @entity75 have been ruled out			0
meanwhile , @entity76 insisted @entity11 ‘ still have it all to prove ’ after claiming our qualifying results fo far were no more than expected			1
they have four points already from their opening games with @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , with their performances in each qualifier heightening the air of optimism that ’s abounded since @entity7 took charge almost two years ago			2
however , pointing to the win and the draw @entity86 and @entity6 took from their games against the world champions respectively , assistant @entity76 believes @entity11 still have much to do if they are to reach a first major finals in 18 years			1
@entity6 boss @entity0 has no doubt @entity2 and @entity10 will handle any flak ‘ there ’s been a lot of quite positive feedback but all we ’ve achieved so far is the minimum expected of us			1
we ’ve beaten @entity85 at home , got a point away from @entity86 - which i think after beating @entity86 over there last year , people hoped we would get at least			0
that ’s all we ’ve got after we lost to @entity84			0
‘ on the other hand , @entity6 have a point more than maybe people expected , and they ’ve beaten @entity85 away which is still going to be a big ask for any of us			2
so we ’ve still got it all to prove			0
if we can get a positive result we can start to believe we actually are on the up			0
‘ this is the most important game of our tenure			0
it ’s a huge opportunity for both teams to take advantage			0
we could beat @entity121 6 - 0 ( in next week ’s friendly ) but it does n’t get us to @entity122			0
’ @entity125 defender @entity124 has been drafted in to replace likely absentee @entity126 , with @entity128 deputising for injured @entity130 team - mate @entity129			0
meanwhile , @entity76 feels it ’s unlikely @entity7 will agree to @entity133 ’s request for @entity134 to be ‘ loaned back ’ to @entity135 for their clash with @entity137 on saturday			1
‘ like @entity124 , if @entity134 comes and trains all week the way @entity139 did when he came , then i ’d think @entity7 wo n’t be releasing him , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s a decision @entity7 will make in conjunction with @entity142 towards the end of the week			2

@entity11 boss @entity7 said it was okay for fans to boo @entity2 and @entity10
@entity14 claimed the pair deserved a ‘ horrible reception ’ for deciding to represent the land of their grandparents
@entity6 boss @entity0 has no doubt @entity2 and @entity10 will handle any flak
