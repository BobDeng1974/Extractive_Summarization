slowly but surely , signs of the @entity1 who won @entity2 last year are starting to re-emerge , as he claimed his second title in four weeks			1
the @entity4 is not @entity5 but a remarkable 5 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 victory over world no 5 @entity6 gave a reminder of why @entity1 was a fixture among the so - called @entity11 for so long			1
at the moment the goal is merely to be in the top eight that will qualify for the @entity15 at the @entity16 next month , and he went some way to achieving that by winning in the @entity19 capital			0
' it will be close , ' he rightly cautioned after toppling the indefatigable @entity39 in a match of frequent service breaks by two of the game 's great returners			2
barely 100 points separate the @entity46 , @entity6 and @entity48 's @entity47 in competition for the few remaining slots			2
@entity51 is not out of it either			0
the 250 points that @entity1 will get as the winner of @entity22 are useful but an awful lot can change in the next fortnight with 500 on offer this week in @entity58 or @entity59 and 1000 for the @entity60 next week			1
@entity1 won his second title in three weeks after rallying to defeat @entity6 5 - 7 , 6 - 2 , 7 - 5 @entity6 was leading the @entity46 5 - 3 in the final set before @entity1 staged his title - winning comeback matters might yet be made easier if @entity66 withdraws from @entity36 to have surgery , something the @entity70 champion repeated was possible			1
@entity1 could not afford to celebrate too much — ' maybe one glass of champagne tonight , but not more than that ' — as he headed straight for @entity58 , where he is expected to be reunited with head coach @entity74			0
it will be his fifth straight tournament in five weeks			0
for @entity1 , sunday 's ranking - points boost will be outweighed by the intangible worth of coming through an extremely tough contest against an opponent who famously never gives it away			1
the @entity46 remonstrates with @entity6 after a contentious decision during the final set @entity1 feels the strain in the early stages of the match after @entity6 claimed the first set 7 - 5 these are the building blocks @entity1 needs to put in place to return to the top of the game			1
this was the kind of eye - catching win that has been lacking since his return from back surgery in january			2
it looked as if he had suppressed the difficult @entity39 on this brisk indoor court when he pulled ahead in the second set after a tight opener			0
@entity1 looked to be cruising when he went 2 - 0 ahead in the decider , only to concede the next four and get broken again when he had pulled back to 3 - 4 on serve			1
@entity1 will be switching his focus to the @entity103 500 after his victory in @entity22 as @entity6 served for the match @entity1 finally opened his shoulders to hit out in glorious fashion			1
at 5 - 5 he broke with a backhand return winner and served out comfortably , winning with an ace that was initially called out			2
and so his late entry was ultimately rewarded			0
losing this final would have been a massive blow , given the amount these two took out of each other in a physical battle			0
at this rate there will be a lot of tired bodies by the time the key event in @entity122 begins a week on monday .			0

@entity1 becomes only fifth *active* player to win *30* or more titles
@entity46 came back from 5 - 3 down in final set to win match
@entity1 wins second tournament in three weeks after ending *14* - month trophy *drought* in *september*
@entity22 victory boosts @entity1 's chances of reaching the @entity135 finals
