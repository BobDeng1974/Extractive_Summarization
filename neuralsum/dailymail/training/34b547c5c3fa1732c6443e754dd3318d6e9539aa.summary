a paper wrist strap similar to the bands worn at festivals can help prevent over-exposure to the sun and reduce the risk of cancer			1
the device lets people know when they have been exposed to a certain amount of @entity10 ( ultra-violet ) radiation by changing colour			0
the monitor works by changing colour from yellow to pink as the strength of uv radiation increases			1
the wristbands change colour when the sun 's uv rays can start to cause damage it operates through an acid - release agent which picks up ultraviolet light and a dye which responds to @entity27 levels in the indicator			0
the agent is decomposed by sunlight , leading to the rapid change in colour			0
the bands will be tailored to different skin types to reflect the different tolerance levels that people have to the sun. for example , a band for someone with fair hair and light skin will change colour quicker than a band for someone with dark hair and dark skin			1
the technology will be commercialised by @entity49 - based company @entity48 , established by @entity49 entrepreneur @entity50			1
' we are very excited about the @entity10 dosimeter technology and we look forward to developing it further and commercialising it , ' said @entity50			0
' there is a substantial need out in the market for a functional @entity10 dosimeter and we look forward to continuing the process			0
' professor @entity60 and dr @entity61 are both responsible for the original invention and were previously with the @entity64 ’s @entity63			1
they will now be engaged as consultants to @entity48			0
@entity67 said : ' the bands will have to cost less than 10p each because they are disposable and need to be thrown away at the end of the day			1
prolonged exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer , of which the most virulent form , malignant melanoma , had 200,000 new cases worldwide in 2008 , according to @entity79 statistics			2
the new technology can alert sunbathers when @entity10 levels are becoming harmful ' the sunburn monitor will make a significant contribution to public health as an affordable , fashionable device which enables people to enjoy the benefits of the sun while at the same time keeping them alert to the risks of over- exposure			2
' said @entity92 , commercialisation manager with the @entity64 ’s @entity93			2
the development of the device received initial funding and support from @entity98 's @entity100 fund .			0

@entity49 company set to commercialise @entity64 's device by spring 2013
disposable bands will cost less than 10p each
