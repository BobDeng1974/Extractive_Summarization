by @entity0 ' we have a target ' : culture secretary @entity3 said immigration is a key issue @entity7 ’s hopes of cutting immigration from @entity9 were dealt a blow after figures showed a surge in the number of @entity14 trying to enter the @entity15 through @entity16			1
the continental border agency estimates the total has already hit 60,000 this year			0
even more have arrived than in 2011 , the year of revolutions that became known as the @entity20			1
once migrants have been accepted into @entity16 , they can then travel easily throughout the @entity15			1
yesterday culture secretary @entity3 said ministers are well aware of public concern over the fact that @entity26 has ‘ virtually no control over ’ immigration from the @entity15			1
mr @entity3 said the @entity29 are determined to ‘ change ’ the rules as part of the renegotiation of @entity26 ’s membership promised by mr @entity7			2
he stressed that the prime minister ’s pledge to reduce net immigration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by the time of the election remains in place , despite a recent surge that has taken the number back over 200,000			2
mr @entity3 said : ‘ we ’ve set a target and that remains in place			1
we do recognise that we , as a country today , have much more control over @entity52 immigration – and we have virtually no control over @entity15 immigration			0
' that ’s something that we ’d like to change , but that is much easier said than done at this point and requires renegotiating with our @entity9 partners and that ’s something @entity29 are committed to			0
’ mr @entity3 , the son of a @entity59 immigrant , told @entity60 : ‘ when i was campaigning in the 2010 election , a number of people on the doorstep would raise the issue of immigration with you , not in a “ for or against ” way , just concerns about the numbers			1
' that ’s a legitimate issue			1
if that ’s what people are concerned about , politicians do need to listen and they do need to react			2
’ crisis : around 250 migrants from @entity79 areas are hosted on a landing craft of @entity16 's @entity83 ship @entity81 after being rescued in open international waters in the @entity85 last week home secretary @entity86 signalled this week that she backs curbs on free movement of migrants			1
yesterday , former prime minister sir @entity90 said the success of @entity93 parties across @entity9 meant mr @entity7 had allies			2
he told @entity95 : ‘ the results of these elections have made a renegotiation much easier			0
‘ it is apparent to governments right across @entity9 that reform of the @entity15 is necessary , it is n’t working as it should , it is n’t working in the way @entity9 citizens think it should			0
’ sir @entity90 said many people are ‘ grinding their teeth ’ in frustration at @entity110			2
but he warned that leaving the @entity15 would ‘ cost us billions ’			0
he backed mr @entity7 ’s plan to hold an @entity114 referendum in 2017 following an attempted renegotiation			0

‘ there will be significant things that can be renegotiated			0
