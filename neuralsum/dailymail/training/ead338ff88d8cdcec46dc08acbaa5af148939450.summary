the @entity0 may have embarked on some of the most dramatic cost - cutting in its history , but it seems there is still some way to go			2
there are almost 4,500 job titles in existence at @entity8 , it has emerged , and almost 2,000 of its staff have the word manager in their title			1
it is thought there are even more staff on top of this who are classed as and paid as managers but do not have the word in their job titles			1
@entity22 : within the @entity8 's news department alone there are more than 1,000 job titles the broadcaster , which has long been accused of having too many middle and senior managers , also employs 191 staff with the word ‘ adviser ’ in the title			1
following a @entity34 request , the @entity0 has also admitted that 44 members of staff have the word ‘ strategy ’ in their job role			2
within its news department alone there are more than 1,000 job titles , another 700 in its tv department and nearly 500 in radio			1
‘ families struggling to pay their licence fee on top of so many other bills , and expecting it to be spent on things like making programmes , will be worried that too much of their money is going on a bloated management structure ’ @entity54 there could be significantly more roles because the figures only refer to @entity0 staff on permanent and fixed - term contracts and do not include casual workers , or jobs at its commercial arm or @entity64			0
yesterday critics said the figures showed the @entity0 was still wasting large amounts of money ‘ on sustaining a massive bureaucracy ’			1
the area with the second highest number of job titles – 918 – was the @entity8 ’s operations group and executive support projects , which is not involved with programme making			2
this part of the business is in charge of areas such as strategy , policy , distribution , property , legal affairs and looking after the organisation ’s buildings			0
as of october 7 , 2011 , there were 4,420 job titles at the corporation with 1,894 staff having the word ‘ manager ’ in their job title			2
a @entity0 spokesman defended the number of different roles , claiming that the title manager is ‘ generally used to reflect a particular level of experience and seniority within the @entity0 rather than someone who actually manages a team of people ’			0
one @entity0 insider said : ‘ some of the titles you come across are just absurd and are beyond belief			0
‘ there always seems to be a lot of managers swilling around – i am not sure how busy they are			0
’ @entity113 , of the @entity114 ’ @entity112 , said : ‘ this is fresh evidence to support longstanding concerns that the @entity0 is wasting huge amounts of money sustaining a massive bureaucracy			1
‘ families struggling to pay their licence fee on top of so many other bills , and expecting it to be spent on things like making programmes , will be worried that too much of their money is going on a bloated management structure			0
’ the news comes after the @entity0 promised last year that it was banning baffling job titles and would make it clearer to the public what staff are doing			1
last month , @entity0 chief operating officer @entity134 was asked on @entity135 why when the @entity8 wanted to put money into programmes it was at the same time trying to recruit a ‘ decision support analyst ’ on £ 58,000 a year			0
she admitted : ‘ i do n’t know what that person actually does but what i do say is that you want the @entity0 to be a well - managed organisation			0
