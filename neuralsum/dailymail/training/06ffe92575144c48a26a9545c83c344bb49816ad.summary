the 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding			1
overall , there were 128,351 in the 43 forces of @entity4 and @entity5 on september 30 last year , the lowest figure since september 2002			1
even thinner blue line : the number of police officers in @entity4 and @entity5 fell by almost 3,500 last year			1
the 2.6 per cent dip in their numbers leave the police force at its lowest strength for more than a decade there has been an even more marked decline in the number of community support officers , or @entity24			1
there are now only 13,552 , down six per cent in a year			1
despite cuts , crime has fallen and ministers say the police are more efficient			2
the statistics were not due out until today , but were mistakenly published on the @entity32 ’s website yesterday			2
officials - already under fire over the trustworthiness of police crime figures - were then forced to rush forward their release date			2
chief constable @entity38 , of the @entity39 , said : ‘ with reduced recruitment and the considerable cuts made to policing budgets , it is not surprising that the number of officers and staff have reduced , and this clearly presents a challenge for the police service			1
‘ however , the effectiveness of policing can not be measured by the number of officers and staff alone			1
‘ the service has risen to the challenge of dealing with significant financial restraints and continued to maintain the protection of the public			0
' @entity58 : there has been an even more marked decline in the number of community support officers , or @entity24			1
there are now only 13,552 , down six per cent in a year last week , constabularies in @entity4 and @entity5 yesterday reported that the number of crimes fell by 3 per cent last year			1
the separate @entity67 showed crime falling by 10 per cent year on year to its lowest level since records began in 1981			1
the survey is traditionally seen as a more reliable barometer of crime levels over time			0
it showed sharp falls in violence - by 13 per cent - and snatch thefts			1
crimes against households fell 10 per cent and bike theft was down 15 per cent , to its lowest level in a decade			1
but there is mounting controversy over whether the crime figures can be trusted			0
the @entity85 has questioned the reliability of the police ’s figures and stripped them of their ‘ gold standard ’ status			0
' @entity93 reform is working ' : policing minister @entity94 denied claims that official crime statistics were masking the truth on offences experts predict that , when the figures are audited properly , crime will once again begin to rise			0
in @entity102 - where figures have been ‘ cleaned up ’ after a period of manipulation - recorded crime has risen by 8 per cent			2
if the same pattern was repeated across the country nearly 300,000 extra crimes would be reported			0
in @entity102 , violent crime was up a fifth and sex offences and robbery by half			0
drug offences were up by 14 per cent , public order offences by 16 per cent and other ‘ miscellaneous ’ crimes by a third			2
it is thought much of the increase is related to the more rigorous recording techniques			0
yesterday , @entity119 said recorded crime statistics must be as ' robust as possible '			0
but he added that both recorded crime and the @entity67 had ‘ fallen by more than 10 per cent ’			2
policing minister @entity94 said : ' police reform is working and two independent measures show crime is falling			0
getting the economy back on track has meant the police have had to do more with less , but they have shown an impressive ability to make savings while still cutting crime			0
' what matters is how officers are deployed , not how many of them there are			2
@entity134 has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels , the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided			0
' ultimately , decisions on the size and composition of a police force ’s workforce are for individual chief officers and @entity149 ( @entity150 )			2
' last night , @entity152 ’s @entity151 , @entity153 said : ‘ @entity154 mistakenly published today will rightly cause concern in communities all over @entity4 and @entity5			1
‘ the government is hollowing out our @entity93			0
@entity152 put 17,000 more @entity158 on the beat			0
now , that progress has been reversed			0

there were 128,351 officers in @entity4 and @entity5 after 2.6 per cent dip
and the number of @entity24 fell 6 per cent to 13,552
