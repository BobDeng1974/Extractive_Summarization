by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 18:17 est , 11 october 2013 alerted : documents claim twod eaths could have been avoided had @entity4 's department taken action after he was alerted in january 2010 @entity8 ’s former health secretary was told about a string of baby deaths – despite his claims he did not remember any ‘ specific ’ warnings , it emerged last night			1
@entity4 said he did not recall being told about the problems at @entity14 in @entity15			1
but documents seen by the @entity17 show mr @entity4 was briefed about the problems in january 2010 , three months before his regulator gave the hospital a clean bill of health			1
it is thought the lives of two babies might have been saved at @entity14 had action been taken by mr @entity4 after he was alerted			1
mr @entity4 was briefed on the scandal ahead of a meeting with local mp , @entity28 , in january 2010			1
the memo he was given mentions five maternity , neonatal and gynaecological incidents including the death of baby @entity34 , who was killed in 2008 by an infection which should have been treated with antibiotics			2
it states that @entity34 ’s death ‘ highlighted a number of underlying contributory factors ’ at @entity40 , which runs the hospital			2
mr @entity4 did not act on the information in the memo , which notes that the incident was being taken ‘ very seriously ’ and that the @entity46 ( @entity47 ) and @entity48 were monitoring the trust			1
three months later , the @entity47 reduced its risk rating of the @entity51 to ‘ green ’ and registered it as compliant			2
a further two babies died after this decision			0
in july , mr @entity4 faced pressure to quit after a review by sir @entity57 revealed failings at 11 hospitals where ‘ thousands ’ of patients needlessly died on his watch			1
last week , mr @entity4 was accused of trying to suppress a critical report into poor hygiene standards at the @entity66 and @entity67 trust in @entity68			1
emails were released suggesting his department ordered the @entity47 not to release a report on the problems during the run - up to the 2010 general election			2
mr @entity4 has strongly denied the claims and has threatened health secretary @entity76 with legal action after he tweeted about the scandal			1
however , the latest revelations over @entity80 will reignite claims that bad news about the @entity83 was being suppressed			0
needless death : @entity34 with his sister @entity85 before he died in @entity14 , @entity15 in june , mr @entity4 denied that he had been warned about the @entity80 scandal			1
last night , @entity88 mp @entity87 said : ‘ this new evidence blows out of the water his claim that he received no warnings about @entity80			0
‘ i fail to see how you could forget or not follow up on a meeting where you ’re warned about serious hospital incidents involving the deaths of babies			0
’ a spokesman for @entity4 said : ‘ @entity4 has acted entirely properly at all times in relation to @entity80			2
a thorough review of his papers shows it was not directly raised with him , nor were any specific warnings given to him by the regulator			0
all of the statements he has made on this issue are entirely accurate			0
‘ the only meeting he had about this trust during his time as secretary of state was requested by @entity28 mp on local cancer services			0
' information on maternity was provided in an annex to the official briefing as part of a wider list of issues that might have been raised by the mp			0
as this issue was not raised at the meeting , there was no call for it to be used			0
‘ in any event , the note records that investigations by the @entity47 and @entity48 were at that time on - going			0
this was the proper course of action			2
no ministerial intervention was required or appropriate that time			0

@entity4 says he did not know about @entity14
documents reveal he was briefed in january 2010 but gave a clean report
it is claimed two lives could have been saved had action been taken then
