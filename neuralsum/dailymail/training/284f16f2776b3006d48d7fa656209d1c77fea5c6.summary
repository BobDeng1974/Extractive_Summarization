such dangerous work among toxic chemicals however leads to a range of injuries including lung problems , untreated wounds , headaches and insomnia			1
the @entity81 - based photographer said most of the boys die from cancer in their 20s , but even being aware of the dangers is not enough to put many of them off carrying on working at the site			1
he said the old lagoon is filled with computers , monitors , @entity92 systems , videoplayers and a range of other devices , as a result of illegal exportation and fake donations labelled as ' development aid '			0
he said while some of the boys are now careful about the risks of working at the site , others continue to remain unaware of the dangers , while some just no longer care			2

' mr @entity65 goes on to write that while he felt sorry for the people who lived in @entity29 , he felt it was wrong to be sad while the children played and spoke of their future plans			1
he writes : ' most boys work together as a group and help each other like a family			0
many of them try to forget the sad parts in their story and focus on their opportunities , which was wonderful to hear , but i had some facts in the back of my mind			0
' most of them will die from cancer in their 20s and grow up without education			2
