the leader of a labor union that represents 12,000 @entity3 immigration officials launched a frontal assault against the @entity5 on tuesday , asking @entity6 to oppose what he said is a plan to unilaterally open the door to a flood of new immigrants after the nov. 4 election			1
@entity17 , president of the @entity18 , warned in a rare public policy statement that @entity21 's immigration tensions are ' about to get exponentially worse – and more dangerous ' if the federal government expands , as expected , the numbers of green cards and work permits it issues to foreign nationals			1
president @entity25 has promised to make a move on immigration policy this year , but his timetable and mechanics are a popular @entity30 guessing game whose ramifications touch on next week 's election and the possibility of a december budget stalemate that could shut down the federal government			1
@entity17 warned tuesday , however , that the state of play – and his army of paper - pushers – are working in the president 's favor			2
' we are still the world 's rubber - stamp for entry into the @entity46 – regardless of the ramifications of the constant violations to the @entity49 , ' @entity17 said			0
their union is a bargaining unit of the @entity84 , which is affiliated with the @entity85			0
' whether it 's the failure to uphold the public charge laws , the abuse of our asylum procedures , the admission of @entity89 radicals , or visas for health risks , ' he said , public safety is already ' being endangered on a daily basis			0
' @entity17 is known inside the beltway as a consistent thorn in the side of @entity103 who want to expand work - visa programs and create new guest worker designations , both of which were part of a @entity109 immigration reform proposal that stalled in the @entity110 last year			1
the bill , which the @entity5 shepherded through the @entity109 with the help of a ' @entity114 ' lawmakers – four @entity103 and four @entity115 – would have attached those conditions to the @entity118 's demands for more border security			1
it would also have put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship			2
when the @entity5 adjourns on december 12 , that legislation will be a dead letter			0
but @entity25 has pledged to take action on his own if the @entity129 stalemate persists			1
part of that action may have been spelled out in a draft proposal published this month , which spelled out @entity55 's intention to purchase the paper stock required to produce as many as 34 million new documents – a combination of work permits and ' green cards , ' the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the @entity46			0
according to the solicitation , the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum of 4 million cards per year for five years , and 9 million in the early stages			0
the company that wins the contract must be equipped to handle a ' potential " surge " in ... demand for up to @entity153 ( 9 million ) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements , ' it reads			2
@entity17 said tuesday that his union members are already seeing an increase in the numbers of interviews they are expected to complete , putting national security at risk			2
34 million new cards : @entity55 has drafted a solicition for bids to sell the government enough raw materials to produce 34 million new green cards and work permits , including a ' surge ' of 9 million in the early days after a government policy shift ' there are plans , ' he warned , ' to waive interviews of applicants who seek adjustment of their status in the @entity3 to ready our workforce for the coming onslaught of applications unforeseen in previous administrations			1
' @entity6 , he said , should ' act now to ensure that @entity185 stops this unilateral amnesty			1
let your voice be heard and spread the word to your neighbors			0
' ' we who serve in our nation 's immigration agencies are pleading for your help – do n't let this happen			0
' it 's unclear what @entity115 could do to counter the @entity5 if the president decided to create new paperwork options for millions of people to emigrate to the @entity3 it 's likely they will take over the @entity109 in january , but @entity25 would be signing any executive order against the backdrop of a lame - duck session of @entity185 in which @entity103 would retain temporary control			1
it 's also possible that @entity109 races in @entity209 or @entity210 could go to runoffs , leaving the @entity109 gavel up in the air while @entity25 readies his signature			1
if @entity115 do secure 51 or more @entity109 seats on @entity217 , they will hold most – but not all – the cards			2
the latest congressional budget resolution kept the government 's bills paid through december 11 , a date that the president could hold over the @entity118 's head in order to win immigration concessions			1
two political analysts , one who works with @entity103 and another who services @entity230 clients , agreed in background conversations with @entity232 that the @entity5 will likely use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage , even if the @entity103 have already been demoted to a @entity109 minority			1
republicans will need an uncharacteristic show of party unity , the two analysts agreed			0
a little busy with @entity241 : @entity25 ( right ) originally said he would act on immigration by the end of the summer , but that deadline has now become an end - of - year mandate major constituency : @entity248 ' rights groups are a large part of the @entity250 , a faction the president ca n't afford to string along forever as the @entity118 grooms new @entity253 candidates to take the national spotlight ' the @entity5 is really counting on disarray in the @entity118 , ' the @entity250 operative said			1
' this is the gang that could n't shoot straight , and the president is waiting for them to squabble their way to chaos			0
who 's against " amnesty " ? who 's part of the @entity266 ? who 's in bed with the business lobby that wants cheap labor ? @entity25 's team thinks they 'll get what they want because no one will be able to stand in a straight line on the other side			1
' @entity276 , the @entity277 chairman , told party activists during a conference call on monday that the @entity118 establishment is moving to the right and embracing the @entity283 's position			2
' it 's unconstitutional , illegal , and we do n’t support it , ' @entity276 said of an executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants , according to @entity290			0
' i do n’t support it			0
it is wrong , ' @entity276 said			0
' it is un-american for a president to try and do such a thing			0
i want to make it clear : there is no part of me , there is not a molecule in my body that agrees with the president on executive amnesty			2
' a @entity230 campaign adviser told @entity232 that @entity25 will have to ' lick his wounds and take this one in the teeth if the @entity103 lose the @entity109			1
he 's just not going to antagonize the majorities of both houses of @entity185 with a massive immigration executive order			2
' ' he has two years left in office , and he 's going to have to learn how to cross the aisle , ' the operative said			0
' if he does this amnesty thing , no one on @entity129 takes his phone calls and his legacy goes to pieces			0

@entity18 president represents 12,000 @entity322 personnel
warns ' massive unilateral amnesty is slated to be issued after the *november* 2014 elections '
move comes as @entity118 is mending internal *fences* and moderates are making common cause with tea *partiers* to find a congressional *roadblock*
republicans are expected to take over the @entity109 in 2015 , leaving @entity25 a short window to change the status of millions who are in the @entity3 illegally
but a dec. 11 deadline to reach another agreement to fund the government could turn immigration into another shutdown *ultimatum*
