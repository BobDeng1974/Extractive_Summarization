the couple are pictured in 2000 actor @entity2 has spoken for the first time about the breakdown in his marriage to former page 3 model @entity6 , revealing that the pair have n’t spoken for two years			1
instead the couple – who have been married for 12 years and have a 13 - year - old son , @entity12 – communicate only by text messages			1
‘ i have n’t talked to her since we parted , ’ said the 48 - year - old former soldier soldier star			1
‘ we are in touch			2
but we do n’t speak			2
it ’s nice and safe that way			2
and that ’s what @entity12 needs			2
‘ i do n’t know why @entity6 decided it ’s better not to speak but , that ’s what she has decided			1
it was n’t my decision , ’ he said			2
‘ it was n’t me that wanted to do that			2
frankly , i ’m not sure how she perceives me now			2
’ the collapse of @entity2 ’s second marriage is clearly a painful subject for the @entity35 star , who found fame in the 1990s @entity38 drama and had a no 1 hit singing @entity40 with co-star @entity41			1
his first marriage to occupational therapist @entity44 ended in 1999 after he had conducted a four - year clandestine affair with @entity46 , the then wife of @entity48 actor , @entity42 is unwilling to lay the blame for his latest split at @entity6 ’s door			1
‘ @entity6 is a lady , ’ he said , ‘ she ’s a great person			1
just not great for me			0
’ he also does not blame his work schedule – which has included travelling abroad to film five series of @entity56 and two of @entity58			1
‘ no , that was n’t the reason , ’ he said			0
‘ ok , maybe it is being away all the time , maybe it ’s not being the greatest husband in the world , but by default that does not make you a bad father			0
but i try to keep my side of the street clean and i am a good dad			0
‘ you get to the point where you may be great as individuals but you ’re not great for one another , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve had to explain that to @entity12			0
' @entity6 and i just grew apart			1
i do n’t blame it on the career			0
it ’s just we were different and we did n’t develop together			0
my mind went in one direction , hers in the other			0
’ while the end of his marriage is clearly a source of much soul searching for @entity2 , it is the separation from his son that causes him most turmoil			1
‘ @entity6 and @entity12 live in the @entity93 now , ’ said @entity2 , who still lives in @entity91 , @entity92 – the small market town where he was born			1
separation : @entity6 is pictured modelling in 1978			1
she has been married to @entity2 for 12 years ‘ @entity12 and i talk all the time but i do n’t see enough of him			1
the most important thing about the separation is not its effect on me or @entity100 , it ’s about how @entity12 is developing			0
and right now he is developing into the most wonderful , creative , ambitious , competent young man			0
’ @entity2 is the @entity103 lad personified : from mining stock , his love for his native @entity92 is embedded deep in his dna			1
his early life was impoverished			0
he spent three years as an apprentice draughtsman at @entity108 on the @entity109 but , smitten by the smell of greasepaint at his local amateur dramatics club , he was desperate to take to the stage full time			2
telling his late father ( also called @entity2 ) that he wanted to leave the shipyard and become a professional actor was a daunting prospect			1
‘ i loved him but i was scared to tell him how i really felt , ’ he recalled			0
‘ when i told him he said , “ what do you mean you want to be an actor ? do you know what you are doing ? you ’re being paid a fortune at the yard , do you know how hard it is to get a job ? ” then there was a lot of swearing			2
‘ i could understand his thinking			0
he was a big guy with hands like shovels , working in the most dangerous occupation in the world			0
then i tell him i want to put on make - up and ponce about in front of a camera			2
’ it was @entity2 ’s attachment to his beloved @entity142 that , in part , may have sparked the first warning signs that his marriage to @entity146 - born @entity6 was on the rocks			1
stars : @entity2 and @entity41 are pictured in tv show soldier soldier ‘ she never warmed to the @entity142 , that ’s the truth , ’ he said			1
‘ she is this kind of oriental flower			0
she came up here and her hair would straighten in the @entity103 damp			0
but that ’s not the reason we grew apart			0
nothing to do with the hair , ’ he laughs			0
the pair met when @entity6 was working as @entity164 ’s secretary			1
‘ i went to his office with @entity41 and there she was , the most beautiful woman i ’d ever seen			0
’ the ten - year age gap ( @entity6 is now 58 ) meant nothing to him			1
when she became pregnant with @entity12 , the pair decided to marry			0
@entity6 had , in fact , been dating @entity164			1
though @entity164 described her at the time as ‘ too possessive ’ it was rumoured he was heart - broken when she left him for @entity2			1
in fact it was a double blow for @entity164 who had just signed @entity2 to his then label , @entity176 , and made him an international star with @entity41			1
it is now his tv fishing shows that are @entity2 ’s first love			2
his extreme series have taken him to more than 90 countries but it nearly cost him his life when he and his crew went overboard off the @entity187 in @entity188			0
‘ i thought i was going to die			0
and i remember thinking , “ i do n’t want anyone else to be @entity12 ’s dad			0

actor and @entity6 now communicate only by text messages
couple have been married for 12 years and have a 13 - year - old son
