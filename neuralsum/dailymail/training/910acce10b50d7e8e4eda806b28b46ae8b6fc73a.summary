@entity2 's @entity1 recall will be confirmed on wednesday when @entity4 's fly - half is included – along with @entity5 – among the replacements named by @entity7 for the clash with @entity9			1
the 27 - year - old playmaker forced his way back into the national squad last month on the back of a series of outstanding performances for his club this season			2
now , with @entity19 missing from the entire @entity20 after suffering a knee injury , @entity2 has earned the right to a bench place , as understudy to the starting no 10 , @entity24			1
@entity2 , pictured in @entity1 training on monday , will be on the bench against @entity9 on friday @entity2 ( centre ) forced his way back into @entity7 's @entity1 squad in december @entity2 practices his kicking after joining up with the @entity1 squad at their @entity32 training base this selection represents a triumph for dogged perseverance and the consistency of his form for @entity4 , despite the disappointment of being omitted from the @entity1 squad for the autumn series at @entity41 last november			1
it also provides encouragement that a place in the @entity46 squad is there for the taking , which should in turn further reduce the fading chance of @entity2 taking up the option of a move to @entity53 , which would leave him in test exile			0
last june , he won two caps in @entity57 , following a period of five - and - a - half years spent off @entity1 's radar – during which time he had a spell with @entity62 in @entity63			2
@entity2 's last appearance in the @entity20 came way back in march 2008 , when he shone against @entity65 on his full debut at @entity41 – scoring 18 points in a compelling personal display			0
the @entity4 fly - half chats with kicking coach @entity70 during a training session last week @entity2 now has every chance of earning a place in @entity1 's @entity46 squad the 27 - year - old , pictured in action against @entity77 last june , won two caps for @entity1 in @entity57 @entity79 is being similarly rewarded for refusing to believe that his international career was over , even at the age of 36			1
the @entity83 has been an enduring force at club level since his last @entity87 appearance , in the quarter - final defeat by @entity53 that heralded the end of @entity1 's ill - fated @entity92 campaign			0
now , in the absence of @entity96 's @entity95 – who is recovering from a broken leg – he will have an opportunity to make his presence felt from the bench and , in the process , reignite his own prospects of being a part of the global tournament later this year			0
@entity5 ( left ) , in training this week , refused to give up on his @entity1 career			0

@entity2 will be understudy to starting no 10 @entity24 on friday
sale fly - half forced his way back into @entity7 's squad last month
@entity19 will miss the entire @entity20 with a knee injury
@entity2 has recovered after being left out of @entity1 's autumn series
