@entity37 commandos later killed @entity3 there in may 2011 in a unilateral raid			0
@entity1 officials were outraged by the @entity3 operation , which led to international suspicion that they had been harboring @entity32 's founder			1
in their eyes , @entity0 was a traitor who had collaborated with a foreign spy agency in an illegal operation on @entity1 soil			1
the case has caused friction between @entity1 and the @entity37 , complicating a relationship that @entity54 views as vital for fighting the @entity55 and @entity32 , as well as negotiating an end to the war in neighboring @entity58			1
in the @entity37 and other @entity60 nations , @entity0 was viewed as a hero who had helped eliminate the world 's most wanted man			2

yesterday , @entity66 spokeswoman @entity65 told journalists that @entity0 's continued detention ' sends exactly the wrong message			2
' critical intelligence : dr @entity0 ran a vaccination program for the @entity2 to collect @entity28 in an attempt to verify the @entity32 leader 's presence at the compound in the town of @entity35 ( pictured ) ' we hope this latest development leads to an outcome that reflects the fact that bringing @entity3 to justice was clearly in @entity1 's interest - as well as ours , ' @entity65 said			1

@entity100 , a commissioner tasked with enforcing the @entity84 , ruled that @entity0 will be re-tried under the regulations by the top political official in @entity17 , @entity99 said			2
@entity0 was previously tried by the official 's assistant			1
the doctor 's lawyer , @entity105 , welcomed the decision to order a re-trial , saying : ' i think it is a good achievement for us			0
' he called the original decision to sentence @entity0 to 33 years in prison ' totally illegal			2

he called the allegations against @entity0 ' baseless			0
' the brother said the last time authorities allowed him to meet with @entity0 was in august 2012 , although the doctor 's wife and children were allowed to see him on july 10			0
it 's unclear whether a re-trial will result in @entity0 being released or simply receiving a reduced sentence			1
freeing the doctor would remove a sore point between @entity1 and the @entity37 at a time when relations have warmed relative to the dark days following the @entity3 raid			1
but the operation still causes consternation in @entity1 , and it could be politically difficult for the government if @entity0 is released .			2
