by @entity0 a new mother has lost over 4st in preparation for her dream wedding , using a hypnotherapy app that claims to create a ' virtual gastric band '			1
@entity6 , 30 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , gained weight when pregnant with her daughter , reaching 13st 2lb two months after giving birth , and was desperate to shed the pounds before she tied the knot			1
having tried numerous fad diets throughout her life , @entity6 decided to try a new - and unusual - method			1
the app she chose uses mental training to reduce the amount you want to eat			2
' i learned a lot of bad habits from my mother , who has also been a yo - yo dieter			1
' when i was pregnant " eating for two " was a big thing and then when i was alone at home with my daughter i would graze			2
' @entity6 's motivation to tackle her weight came , in addition to wanting to look good for her wedding , from her grandmother @entity36 who passed away a month before the birth of her daughter			1
' she was a very special woman to me and before she died said : " do the most you can for your daughter and be there for her			0
" ' i promised her i would sort myself out , ' she says			0
realising that traditional diet regimes were not going to work for her , @entity6 was inspired by a session of hypnotherapy she had in her youth to tackle low self - esteem			1
she searched online and came across a £ 4.99 hypno - app which promised that it could help her to tackle the reasons she overate			1
@entity6 says : ‘ i started using the app in january 2013 , two months after having my daughter and after the @entity52 break was over			1
‘ i felt enormous pressure to lose the baby weight and also to look good for the wedding			1
i wanted to do it for me but comments from the family also spurred me on			0
‘ i 've tried numerous plans over the years			2
as soon as i thought i was putting on weight i 'd try a fad diet and always ended up losing the weight then putting double on			1
i could n't maintain it			0
i 'm a petite person so a little weight really shows			2
‘ they all worked in the short term but i found when i 'm not allowed something i want it even more and found them unsustainable or eating more because i still had ' points / sins ' left			0
’ @entity6 used to struggle with portion control and grazed a lot when at home ( left ) but found hypnosis helped her to change her eating habits so she only eats when she is hungry ; @entity6 pictured after weight loss ( right ) rather than banning or restricting certain foods , @entity6 used the hypnosis and mental training on the @entity81 app , which offers a step - by - step hypnotherapy program that guides you to weight loss , to try and turn herself off the unhealthy food , as well as increasing portion control			1
to her surprise , she found it began to work			0
‘ i noticed a change very quickly in my eating habits			0
i have always been conscious of eating healthily but do like my @entity93 and @entity94 takeaways and general junk			0
‘ i seemed to go off those or choose healthier options from the menu and really cut down my portion sizes			0
i lost 4lb in the first week and was ecstatic it was working without cutting out a food type			0
’ @entity6 dropped from 13st 4lb to a slim 8st 13lb and was able to fit into her dream dress for her @entity104 beach wedding i feel so much better and more confident			1
i find i 'm not in between sizes and more and find it easier to find clothes			0
i still have body hang - ups but no longer need to hide under baggy or frumpy clothes			2
' i also am happy with photos that are taken with my daughter without thinking how awful i look			0
@entity6 was desperate to lose weight , having failed at many fad diets in the past ‘ it also made me so much more excited about my wedding ! when i went to try on wedding dresses none of them fitted in the shop ! now i 've got my dream dress - but two sizes smaller ! ' in addition to transforming her body , @entity6 says the app helped her deal with the challenges of having a young child by keeping her calm and well rested			1
‘ i found that listening to the hypnosis calmed me down and made me focus on myself			2
it gave me a positive outlook and relaxed me			0
‘ i found i was n't sleeping well with a new - born and all thoughts to do with wedding plans and the hypnosis just helped me ' zone out ' and achieve a healthy night ’s sleep			1
‘ it also helped me de-stress when my daughter went down for a nap			0
it has done wonders for me and my self - esteem , i 'm proud that i did this myself without effort			2

@entity6 dropped from 13st 2lb to a trim 8st 13lb using a hypnosis app
had tried numerous fad diets but continued to struggle with her weight
fit into her dream wedding dress and *fulfilled* promise to her grandma to get control of her yo - yo dieting
