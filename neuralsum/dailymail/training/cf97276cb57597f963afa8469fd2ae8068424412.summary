by @entity0 last updated at 3:06 pm on 24th february 2012 @entity1 could be about to dip into its $ 98billion fortune and pay its shareholders a dividend for the first time in 17 years			2
new ceo @entity6 , who took over from @entity7 , said he believed the world 's most valuable company now has more money than it needs			1
and he revealed the board is deciding whether to break from the cash - hoarding ways of his predecessor - who suspended shareholder payments in 1995 when the firm was in such deep trouble it needed to hold on to every cent			1
break with tradition : @entity1 's new ceo @entity6 ( left ) could pay shareholders for the first time since @entity7 ( right ) suspended the payments in 1995 when the firm was financially at rock bottom pondering : @entity6 , pictured here at the launch of the @entity26 in october 2011 , said the board was thinking ' very deeply ' about the move things got so bad that @entity1 turned to rival @entity30 in 1997 for a $ 150 million infusion to stay afloat			1
@entity30 came to the rescue at the same time @entity1 named @entity7 , who died in october , as its ceo - a decision that turned out to be one of the smartest business moves ever made			2
haunted by memories of @entity1 's grim times , @entity7 kept accumulating cash even as the company 's fortunes soared during the final decade of his life			1
@entity6 , though , appears willing to return some of the cash to shareholders since he succeeded @entity7 as @entity1 's ceo last august			1
he said , during a question - and - answer session at the firm 's annual shareholders ' meeting yesterday : ' we are thinking about this very deeply			1
' this is n't a case where 100 percent of people are going to agree with what we do			2
but , frankly speaking , it 's more than we need to run the company			1
' valuable : @entity1 , which has stores across the world , now has a market valuation of $ 480 billion - more than the combined value of @entity30 and prominent rival @entity63 one @entity1 shareholder , @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 , urged @entity6 to resist committing to a dividend every three months			1
he said it makes more sense for @entity1 to pay a one - time dividend later this year before the expiration of a provision that limits the federal tax rate on dividends to 15 per cent			1
if @entity1 opts for a regular quarterly dividend , @entity64 is worried it might be misinterpreted by some investors as a sign that @entity1 is losing confidence in its ability to keep propelling its stock price higher as the company churns out hit products such as the @entity83 and @entity84			1
@entity1 is facing yet another challenge to its use of the @entity84 trademark in @entity88 - but this time in a court in @entity90			2
a @entity92 spokesman said the company filed a lawsuit against @entity1 's use of the trademark inside mainland @entity88 in the @entity97 @entity96 on february 17			1
an attempt by @entity92 to win an injunction to stop @entity1 from selling @entity84 in @entity100 was foiled this week			2
a court there rejected the case pending the resolution of a similar lawsuit in a higher court in @entity88			0
@entity1 had no immediate direct comment on the @entity90 lawsuit			0
the companies are feuding over whether @entity92 sold the mainland @entity88 rights to the @entity84 trademark to @entity1 in a 2009 deal			0
during the past year , @entity1 's stock has surged 50 per cent to create about $ 160 billion in shareholder wealth			0
@entity1 now has a market value of $ 480 billion - more than the combined value of @entity30 and prominent rival @entity63			0
@entity1 shares gained $ 3.35 yesterday to close at $ 516.39			0
the high price sparked a question about whether @entity1 plans to split its stock to make it more affordable to buy			0
@entity6 indicated it is unlikely to occur , saying the board has studied the history of other companies that regularly split their stock and concluded ' it does nothing ' for long - term returns			1
@entity1 last split its stock seven years ago			0
the shares have increased 11-fold since then			0
although most of those gains occurred under @entity7 ' leadership , @entity1 's stock and financial results have remained stellar under @entity6 , @entity136 's hand - picked successor			1
@entity6 has worked as a top @entity1 executive since 1998			1
given how well @entity1 has been doing , shareholders had little reason to complain at yesterday 's hour - long meeting			0
while shareholders waited in a 40 - minute line to get inside the meeting at @entity1 's @entity145 headquarters , a few protesters carried signs urging the company to ensure that workers building its products in @entity151 and @entity88 factories are paid more and treated humanely			2
' @entity153 , ' one sign implored			0
another stated : ' @entity156 an ethical phone			0
' no questions about the conditions in @entity1 's overseas factories were posed during the meeting			0
in other matters , @entity1 agreed to adopt a proposal from the public pension fund @entity163 that will require all of the company 's directors to receive a majority of shareholder votes to remain on the board			2
the proposal was backed by more than 80 per cent of the shareholder votes counted in the preliminary results announced by @entity1 thursday			0
all eight of @entity1 's current directors were re-elected with at least 81 per cent of the shareholder votes in the preliminary results , so the switch to majority - voting rules would n't have changed this year 's outcome if the new rules had already been in effect .			0
