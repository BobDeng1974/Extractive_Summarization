challenging : education secretary @entity0 today told @entity1 new gcse exams would be more ambitious and more rigorous			1
@entity0 today declared an end to the ' cram and forget ' style of learning as he unveiled new gcse exams to help young @entity6 teenagers compete with the best in the world			1
the @entity0 unveiled the biggest schools shake - up in a generation , putting a new emphasis on tougher testing for 16 - year - olds , with less coursework and more focus on exams at the end of two - year courses			1
teenagers will have to study more @entity20 , poetry , algebra , genetics and ecology to acheive the best grades to bring an end to ‘ discredited ’ qualifications			1
mr @entity0 told the commons the new exams will be ' more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous '			2
he added : ' young people in this country deserve an education system that can compete with the best in the world , a system which sets – and achieves – high expectations			0
' today ’s reforms are essential to achieve this goal			0
' by making gcses more demanding , more fulfilling , and more stretching we can give our young people the broad , deep and balanced education which will equip them to win in the global race			2
' pupils in @entity45 will start studying in september 2015 for new gcses in @entity48 language , @entity48 literature , maths , biology , chemistry , physics , combined science , geography and history			1
they are due sit the first exams in the summer of 2017			2
in @entity48 literature , pupils will be asked to study at least one play by @entity59 , romantic poetry , a 19th century novel , poetry from the 1850s onwards , and fiction or drama since the @entity66 , according to documents published by the @entity68			1
the new maths gcse features advanced algebra , statistics , ratio , probability and geometry , while those students who choose to take geography will undertake two different types of fieldwork which will be assessed in an exam			0
and in history , pupils will have to complete an in - depth study based on one of three periods - @entity84 ( 500 - 1500 ) , @entity85 ( 1450 - 1750 ) or @entity86 ( 1700 to present day )			1
the new gcse history course also contains no controlled assessment - coursework completed in the classroom - with exams based on extended essays and short answers			1
new science gcses contain practical experiments and extended work on topics such as genetics , ecology , energy and space			2
mr @entity0 said the changes mean ' more extended writing in subjects like @entity48 and history ; more testing of advanced problem - solving skills in mathematics and science ; more testing of mathematics in science gcses , to improve progression to a levels			1
' more challenging mechanics problems in physics ; a stronger focus on evolution and genetics in biology ; and a greater focus on foreign language composition , so that pupils require deeper language skills			2
' this higher level of demand will equip our children to go onto higher education or a good apprenticeship - and we can raise the bar knowing that we have the best generation of teachers ever in our schools to help students achieve more than ever before			2
' grade inflation : the government claims increases in gcse pass rates show the exams have been getting easier and reform is needed the government believes a return to traditional academic subjects and the slashing of coursework and resits will ‘ restore rigour ’ to the education system			1
education minister @entity149 claimed rising results every summer had disguised the fact that exams were getting easier in a ' race to the bottom ' by exam boards			2
she said : ' we can not carry on with a system that is n’t delivering , where there has been rampant grade inflation and where international league tables tell us we have stagnated compared with the rest of the world			0
' for too long we have pretended that students ’ results are getting better , whereas actually all that has been happening is that exams have been getting easier and there has been a race to the bottom between exam boards			2
we need to stop that happening now , ' she told @entity171			0
@entity173 education secretary @entity172 raised concerns about results depending on end - of - year exams but shadow education secretary @entity172 said he was worried the assessment of pupils at @entity179 would become more unreliable if the government moved towards focusing on end - of - course exams			1
he said : '' moving towards linear assessment will reduce the reliability of gcse - less coursework means less assessment time which leads inevitably to lower reliability			1
' this is about as cast iron a rule in assessment as there is '			0
' @entity190 , from the @entity191 , expressed concern with the proposals and felt they were being ' rushed '			1
she said : ' we think this is slightly rushed and demeans the achievements of students who have taken gcses in the past ' she also refuted suggestions that exams are getting easier			1
' just because more children are successful does not mean that exams are getting easier , ' she said			2
exams watchdog @entity204 is to consult on a new grading scale based on numbers one to eight , with eight the top grade			0
there will be fewer awards , to reflect the harder content , and greater differentiation among more able candidates			0
@entity214 sources said coursework and ‘ controlled assessment ’ – a kind of supervised coursework , which now accounts for 25 per cent of the final mark – had been ‘ very badly abused ’ and would be almost entirely replaced with written exams			1
a small number of subjects such as science , will still involve practicals			0
‘ in what is considered a “ pass ” , now widely thought of as a c , there will be an increase in demand to reflect that of high - performing jurisdictions like @entity230 and @entity231 , ’ said a source			0
stringent : language exams will be tougher with more @entity45 to foreign language exercises mr @entity0 ’s allies insist @entity239 will not be able to stop the new exams if they win power in may 2015			1
a new curriculum will be in place from september 2014 and exam boards will prepare for the new papers years ahead			0
@entity204 is also unlikely to agree to undo the reforms			0
@entity247 and @entity248 have made clear they do not want the reform and @entity204 will have to rename the gcse in @entity45 to distinguish it from their exams			0
sources close to mr @entity0 did not recognise the name ‘ @entity255 ’ , which had been rumoured , and said no decision had been made on what the new exam should be called			0
new curriculum : there will be a greater number of written exams as the coursework component was ' abused ' as an easy way to gain marks @entity179 pass rates have soared in recent years			1
last year , 22.4 per cent of passes were at a or a *			0
in 1988 , when the exam began , 8.6 per cent got a top grade			0
a study by @entity271 and @entity272 found attainment in maths had changed little since the mid- 1970s , despite results			0
mr @entity0 was forced to retreat from a plan to replace the gcse with an @entity277 , set by a single exam body , but today ’s reforms still represent the biggest shake - up since the gcse was introduced .			0

new tougher gcses will start from september 2015
@entity48 exams will *include* more poetry and nineteenth - century novels
written exams will be *favoured* as pupils used coursework for easy marks
@entity191 expresses concern with plans and claims they are being ' rushed '
