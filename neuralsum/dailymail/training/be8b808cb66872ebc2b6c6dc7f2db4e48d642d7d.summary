@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 uncorked a scathing attack on anti-war protesters who interrupted an @entity7 hearing on thursday , earning applause by barking , ' get out of here , you low - life scum ! ' activists with the far - left pacifist group @entity13 stood with banners when former secretary of state @entity15 entered the room , accusing him of committing war crimes during his tenure as @entity21 's top diplomat and as the national security adviser			1
they shook handcuffs in his face and chanted ' @entity26 for war crimes ' while @entity0 , who chaired the hearing about global threats to the @entity21 , sat dumbfounded and embarrassed			1
he presided over @entity21 's withdrawal from the conflict and won the @entity64 for his efforts			0
@entity0 became visibly angry on thursday when police were n't on the scene immediately to remove the protesters from the hearing chamber			1
' could i ask our @entity71 to help instill order here ? you know , someone find out where the @entity71 is ? ' he asked from his spot on the dais			2
' you know , ' he told the group of pink - clad agitators , ' you 're going to have to shut up , or i 'm going to have you arrested			0
' one man , being escorted from the room by a uniformed cop , shouted something back at the senator			0
' get out of here , you low - life scum , ' @entity0 replied before the audience erupted in applause			2
@entity0 offered an apology to @entity15 for the distraction			1
' i 've been a member of this committee for many years , and i have never seen anything as disgraceful and outrageous and despicable as the last demonstration that just took place , ' he said			0
' arrest @entity100 ! ' : part of the left 's historical narrative casts @entity15 as a criminal for helping expand the @entity61 to neighboring @entity59 and @entity60 @entity105 and angry : two of the @entity107 protesters who had their palms painted red to imply that the former secretary of state had blood on his hands for his actions in office @entity71 eventually removed the protesters and @entity0 apologized for the disurbance accusation : the @entity13 group campaigns against any military involvement overseas and says @entity15 should be prosecuted for civilian deaths in @entity59 sitting protest : some of the group stayed in their seats as the demonstration went on and displayed red hands power trio : @entity15 , @entity38 and @entity53 were asked in front of the committee to give their views as former secretaries of state ' from all of my colleagues ... i 'd like to apologize for allowing such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction			1
' when @entity15 began to speak , the remaining protesters erupted a second time			1
his fellow former secretary of state @entity38 , who also testified , stood to salute him as more applause ensued â€“ which drowned out the @entity13 members			1
' i salute @entity15 for his many contributions to peace and security , ' @entity38 said			2
@entity0 praised @entity15 as someone ' who served his country with the greatest distinction			2
' the group , @entity13 , claims to be an organization for women to oppose ' the global militarism '			1
it claims it is ' rooted in a network of local organizers , online supporters and generous donors , with an emphasis on joy and humor '			0
and it says : ' our tactics include satire , street theater , creative visuals , civil resistance , and directly challenging powerful decision - makers in government and corporations			0
and of course , wearing pink			0
' its next planned event is to protest at a screening of @entity177 in @entity178			0
the movie has attracted criticism from anti-war activists over its portrayal of the conflict in @entity184 , but been a huge box office hit			0
@entity0 said in a statement after the hearing : ' @entity13 's typical protest tactics include interrupting congressional hearings with chanting and sign - holding , which while disruptive and improper , do not represent a threat to witnesses			1
' what happened today was far different			0
as dr. @entity15 entered the hearing room to take his seat , a group of @entity13 protesters rushed up to the witness table to confront him , waving handcuffs within inches of his head			1
' some senators were concerned enough for dr. @entity15 's safety that they came down off the dais to support the witnesses			2
with no @entity21 @entity71 intervening , the episode went on for several minutes			0
' @entity13 is embracing their latest nickname as delivered by sen. @entity0 on thursday reactions on @entity211 ranged from shock to awe , but many said they enjoyed watching @entity0 uncork his anger			2

@entity2 @entity1 was *slamming* @entity13 activists for *condemning* the former secretary of state and *shaking* handcuffs in his face
another former secretary of state , @entity38 , 94 . stood and saluted @entity15 , 91 , as the protesters chanted
@entity71 *tossed* a few screaming *peaceniks* out of the @entity227 hearing chamber but others were allowed to stay long enough to yell a second time
the audience applauded @entity0 *loudly* after he shouted at the activists
the women 's group claims it wants ' mothers , *grandmothers* , sisters , and *daughters* ' ... ' to oppose the global militarism '
