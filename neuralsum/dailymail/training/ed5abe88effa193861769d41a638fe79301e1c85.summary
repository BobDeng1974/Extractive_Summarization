under questioning from chief prosecutor @entity52 , @entity10 said she heard gunshots while lying awake around 3 a.m. on the night of the shooting , and then heard the ' terrified , terrified ' screams of a woman			1
' the screaming at that stage just continued , ' said @entity10 , who recalled looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated estate where her family and @entity1 lived			1
she said she told her husband @entity63 , who previously testified , that the screaming sounded as though a ' family murder ' had taken place			0

' you could definitely hear two different voices			0

defence lawyer @entity74 has said that after @entity1 fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to @entity8 after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle			1

together : @entity8 pictured with @entity1			2
the prosecution allege he intentionally killed her after an argument scene : @entity1 shot @entity118 through the bathroom door at his home ( above ) in @entity39 in the early hours of @entity121 last year prosecutors at @entity1 ' murder trial have presented a ' golden thread ' of evidence suggesting @entity8 screamed before she died , leaving the double - amputee athlete with ' serious questions ' to answer and his defense likely hinging on his own testimony , a legal expert in @entity131 said			2
three neighbours say they heard a woman scream before and during the deadly gunshots coming from @entity1 ' home in the early hours of @entity121 last year.the pathologist who performed the autopsy on @entity8 's body said it would have been ' abnormal ' for her not to scream from some of her injuries			1
a police ballistics expert concluded that the first shot @entity1 fired through a toilet door hit @entity8 in the hip and caused her to collapse , but did n't immediately kill her			2
from the policeman 's testimony , @entity8 likely had time to yell out before she was hit by two more shots as she covered her head with her arms in a desperate attempt to protect herself			0
' suddenly what we have is @entity1 firing at @entity8 while her hands are covering her head while she 's screaming in the toilet , and that 's murder , ' said @entity159 , a defense lawyer and former state prosecutor who says he has worked on at least 100 murder cases			1
@entity162 , who is following the trial but not involved , said the prosecution has ' definitely ' made a case for murder against the @entity68 runner for the fatal shooting of @entity8 , and @entity1 ' defense must now respond			0
chief prosecutor @entity52 has so far presented a specific line of evidence compellingly , @entity159 said			0
using the accounts of neighbors and backing them up with the expert opinion of pathologist @entity175 and police ballistics investigator capt. @entity176 , @entity52 may have shown to the court that it was ' reasonable ' that @entity8 screamed during the four shots fired at her , @entity159 said			0
' there 's definitely a golden thread here , ' @entity159 told @entity182 in a telephone interview , using a courtroom term that refers to the prosecution 's duty to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			0
' a golden thread of someone who was screaming and who was shot			0
the objective facts , which are the injuries she sustained , coupled with the expert opinion , tied with your circumstantial evidence presented by witnesses			0
and if that ties up with one another then @entity1 has got a major problem			0

@entity10 : heard two sets of gunshots and male and female screams
defence has countered neighbours were hearing @entity1 screaming
' was definitely a female screaming for quite a period , ' said @entity10
