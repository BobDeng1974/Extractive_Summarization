for @entity1 , it seems being a self - styled anti-capitalist revolutionary really does pay the bills			1
the left - wing comedian 's new revolution book has enjoyed monumental sales - earning the star and his publishers a staggering £ 230,000 in just 11 days			1
the sales figures may further fuel his reputation as ' a champagne socialist ' - a label he was given by @entity15 users after ducking out of left - wing demonstrations in @entity17 on wednesday night to head to an exclusive celebrity - packed @entity19 party			1
the star has found that his @entity15 messages featuring his thoughts on society have prompted others to add the word @entity37 because they sound like the rambling lines of the @entity36 song released in 1994			2
brand said he was not offended by the mickey - taking but was planning to team up with @entity48 to record a version of the hit @entity51 by @entity31 , who were famously @entity36 's chart rivals and had a high profile battle to top the charts 19 years ago			1
since @entity57 posted the tweet ( top ) , social media users , including @entity56 , have mocked @entity1 for the wordy narrative in his book			2
today the comedian failed to see the funny side as he responded to the @entity65 leader the joke , which came from @entity15 user @entity67 , was even retweeted by @entity56 today - and brand quickly hit back at the @entity65 leader showing a severe sense of humour failure			1
but in an interview with radio station @entity71 , he told presenter @entity72 : ' i 'm a comedian , and i make all my living out of mucking around and talking , and i 've certainly tormented people in the past			0
so yeah , i do n't mind that , i think - unless it 's malicious			1
' he pointed out that his sidekick from his old @entity81 show , @entity82 , had similarly said ' @entity37 ' many years ago when he launched into a rant			0
brand went on : ' i do n't know @entity85 particularly , but i 've spoken to @entity48 and we plan to respond with a roll with it single			2
i 'll say ' roll with it ' after every seven words			0
' the comedian and actor said his old pal @entity48 would not be attending his live show at the @entity94 in @entity17 next week			0
' i 've not invited him , because he 's not been supportive enough lately , ' he said			2
' if he 's seen anywhere near the vicinity , i 'm going to have someone grab him by the eyebrow , tie a kite to it , and send him off into the ether			2
' official figures from @entity103 show that the book has already sold 22,119 copies since its launch on october 23			1
so far it has only been released in hardback and its retail price is £ 20 - although it is available at much cheaper on @entity111 and other internet sellers			2
it is published by @entity113 , whose owners @entity116 are the largest education company and book publisher in the world - and owners of the @entity121			1
one publishing expert said : ' it 's an awful lot of money to turnaround in such a short period			2
' popular : revolution has already raked in £ 230,000 for brand and his publishers the book has been panned by critics who laid into the wordy comedian for his naïve and insulting views			1
in the book , he questions why companies export cars , why @entity138 is holed up in the @entity140 embassy and compares the country 's workers to @entity144 's daughter			1
on wednesday night , @entity1 joined thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators as they descended on @entity146 for a protest which saw scuffles with police			2
the star - who quit drink and drugs 13 years ago - was spotted donning one of the @entity155 masks widely used by members of radical groups			0
brand - who is worth £ 9million - said he wanted to see a ' loving , peaceful protest ' and told activists : ' stay cool , stay cool			1
i think you should be careful			0
do n't get beaten up and arrested tonight			0
' he then left the protest early to join celebrities including fellow comedians @entity167 and @entity169 in the @entity19 for the press night of @entity171 at the @entity172			0
many took to @entity15 to criticise the millionaire			0
@entity175 tweeted : ' @entity1 loves a revolution but then leaves demonstration early to go to a celeb freebie party # fakeass			1
' and @entity180 posted : ' i wonder if anti capitalism @entity1 was driven there by his chauffeur in the @entity185 ? what a hypocrite			0
' the star also came under criticism recently when it emerged that his film project is being backed by bankers			0
hefty profits : the comedian , thought to be worth around £ 9million , appeared on @entity24 today it was revealed that @entity195 had raised nearly £ 1 million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and @entity199 footballer @entity198 to make the documentary about @entity1			0
investors were enticed with generous tax breaks to support the film , portraying @entity1 , 39 , as a ‘ troubled visionary ’ seeking to change the world			0
he has previously called for an ' orgy of banker bashing '			1
talking about the financial crisis he added : ' when looking for the culprits look for the people who have got loads of bonuses and loads of money , they 're the people that are criminal , they 're the people that need to be prosecuted			0
' and in his book , @entity219 , he calls for the abolition of debt and states saying : ' when people say , " the system works " they mean " the system works for me			0
' he has previously declared on @entity230 : ‘ @entity231 says profit is n’t a dirty word			1
well i say profit is a filthy word			1
’ these trenchant positions appear at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film as well as the hefty sum he will pocket from book sales			0
film backed by bankers : it recently emerged that the star 's documentary about himself was made by @entity195 - which raised nearly £ 1 million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers brand appears with @entity253 on @entity230 in october 2013 - where he famously told people not to vote			1
