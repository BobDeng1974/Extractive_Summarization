a team of @entity9 ' space farmers ' have successfully grown , and harvested , a vegetable patch on board the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
the harvest , which includes @entity15 leafy greens , dwarf wheat and peas , has now also been verified as safe to eat			1
a team of @entity9 ' space farmers ' have successfully grown , and harvested , a vegetable patch on board the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
the harvest , which includes @entity15 leafy greens , pictured , dwarf wheat and peas , has now also been verified as safe to eat in august 2007 , the @entity26 space shuttle mission launched into space with 10 million cinnamon basil seeds			1
the majority of the seeds were returned to @entity31 for students to grow in plant growth chambers they designed , but 16 seeds were left behind on the @entity12 for an in - orbit experiment			1
flight engineer @entity37 documented the plants ' growth by photographing the plants inside the chambers every other day for nearly three weeks			0
then , in 2010 , @entity43 scientists sent flowers to the @entity12 to see if roots could grow in weightless environment			2
seeds of the flower arabidopsis thaliana germinated onboard the station and sprouted roots in the same way they do on @entity31 – leaving the seed in search of nutrients in the soil - therefore proving gravity is n’t needed			0
currently , all food used by astronauts is flown to the @entity12 on resupply missions periodically throughout the year			1
this latest breakthrough in space farming could mean that astronauts could become self - sufficient , growing their own food during long - duration missions			0
it would also save money in resupplying missions , and in fuel because the launch weight of each mission would be lower			0
the next step is to sow rice , tomatoes and bell peppers after repairing the station ’s @entity75 greenhouse			1
@entity77 , a researcher at the @entity78 told an annual space conference in @entity80 : ' the experiments with peas have been very promising ’ and added the seeds produced were of ‘ extraordinary quality			1
' researchers are also planning to grow a special grass species called purple false brome			0
scientists have already sequenced the genome of this grass and the space farmers plan to use this sequencing to look for any genetic abnormalities that may have been caused by growing in space			1
this is n’t the first time plants have been grown in space			2
in august 2007 , the @entity26 space shuttle mission launched into space with 10 million cinnamon basil seeds			0
flight engineer and @entity9 cosmonaut @entity101 is pictured with @entity77 , a researcher at the @entity78			2
the next step is to sow rice , tomatoes and bell peppers , like the ones pictured , after repairing the station 's @entity75 greenhouse this artist 's impression shows how a greenhouse of the future could look in space			1
@entity43 is already planning to see if humans could live on the moon by seeing if plants can be grown in a lunar environment the majority of the seeds were returned to @entity31 for students to grow in plant growth chambers they designed , but 16 seeds were left behind on the @entity12 for an in - orbit experiment			1

the @entity145 team is constructing a small technology demonstration unit ( illustrated right ) to study germination of plants ( mock - up pictured left ) in lunar gravity and radiation on the moon			0
the experiment will hint at whether humans could one day live there aside from food , plants can also use the carbon dioxide exhaled by the astronauts and be used to recycle human waste into food			2
astronauts can already drink water distilled from sweat and urine			0
@entity43 is also planning to see if humans could live on the moon by seeing if plants can be grown in a lunar environment			2
the @entity170 space agency plans on sowing its first seeds in specially designed canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to thrive , that it will send to the moon in 2015			0
a group of scientists , students and volunteers - known as the @entity145 team - are constructing a small unit to study the germination of plants when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation .			0

@entity9 astronauts grew leafy greens , dwarf wheat and peas
plants were grown in @entity75 greenhouse on the @entity12
the plants have been verified as safe to eat by @entity80 researchers
researchers also plan to check plants for any genetic abnormalities
the next step is to sow rice , tomatoes and bell peppers
