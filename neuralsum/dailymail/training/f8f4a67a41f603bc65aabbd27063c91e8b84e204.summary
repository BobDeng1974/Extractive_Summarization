' @entity16 is the niece of president @entity7 , as the eldest child of younger brother @entity20			1
while her father was the victim of an assassination as well , she does n't believe it 's helpful to dwell on the past			0

' conspiracy theories surrounding the president 's assassination have been reviewed in recent weeks as the nation approaches the 50 - year anniversary of his assassination			1
president @entity7 was shot while driving in @entity39 , @entity40 on november 22 , 1963			0
moments before : president @entity7 was shot on november 22 , 1963 as he was driving through @entity39 , @entity40 with his wife , first lady @entity41 family ties : @entity0 is the daughter of @entity44 's brother , @entity20 ( right )			1
@entity0 is pictured between her father and mother @entity46 , with brothers @entity48 ( second left ) and @entity49 ( left ) the main suspect behind the assassination , @entity2 , was apprehended shortly after the shooting , but shot and killed himself by nightclub operator @entity53 as he was being transferred to county jail			1
since @entity2 never got a trial , no one knows for certain his motivations behind the assassination			1
while conspiracy theories surrounding @entity7 's death have largely been downplayed in the past , they are now becoming more mainstream with testimonies like @entity16 's			1
secretary of state @entity64 also recently lent credibility to one conspiracy theory , during an interview with @entity68 about the assassination			2
secretary @entity64 revealed that he does n't believe @entity2 would have worked alone as the government claimed in their official finding			1
suspect : secretary of state @entity64 said that he believes that an outside force - possibly in the @entity73 or @entity74 - influenced @entity2 's decision to kill president @entity7 ' to this day , i have serious doubts that @entity2 acted alone , ' @entity64 said			1
' i certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself , i mean i 'm not sure if anybody else is involved - i wo n't go down that road with respect to the @entity83 theory and all that - but i have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of @entity2 's time and influence from @entity74 and @entity88			2
' the particular theory that @entity64 mentioned is one that was ignored by the @entity90 who investigated the 1963 shooting			2
a number of witnesses recalled seeing smoke and smelling gunpowder near a grassy knoll along the parade route , hinting that there could have been a second shooter who fired from a different angle			0
looking back : the interview was part of a series being compiled by @entity68 ( left ) about the 50th anniversary of @entity7 's death the connections that @entity2 had to @entity88 and @entity74 that the secretary of state mentioned are far more factual convictions , as it is known that @entity2 defected to the @entity73 and moved there			2
he only returned to the @entity111 the year before @entity7 was shot			0
when he did come back to the @entity111 , @entity2 lived in @entity112 and rented out a room from an advocacy group called @entity115			0
he spent a good deal of time with communist sympathizers , and traveled to @entity119 in september 1963 - just two months before @entity7 's assassination - in hopes of obtaining a visa and going on to @entity74 , but his visa application was rejected			1
‘ i think he was inspired somewhere by something and i do n't know what or if or any - i ca n't pin anything down on that , ’ @entity64 said in the interview .			0
