a mystery severed hand and fresh evidence from a nurse has raised suspicions of a political cover - up over @entity8 's deadliest post-war terrorist attack , it emerged today			1
thirteen people were killed and more than 200 injured when a huge bomb ripped through the crowd at @entity14 's world - famous @entity12 in 1980			1
police quickly concluded the explosives were planted by a lone - wolf extremist , the 21 - year - old neo-nazi @entity18 who died in the attack			1
but late last year , @entity8 prosecutors reopened the investigation after growing concerns that there may have been a cover - up among the political elite			2
now new evidence has emerged surrounding a severed hand which was found at the scene of the bombing that night			1
fresh evidence surrounding a mystery severed hand has raised suspicions of a political cover - up over the 1980 @entity12 bombing ( above ) which killed 13 people and injured more than 200 others police ruled the hand could only have belonged to @entity18 , even though its fingerprints were never found in the geology student 's car he drove the scene , only at his flat			1
a nurse has now spoken for the time about treating a young man whose lower arm was missing in the aftermath of the bombing , suggesting @entity18 may have had an accomplice			1
the unnamed medic told @entity8 's @entity52 television channel last night that the arm had been injured in the explosion and had to be amputated , according to the @entity55			2
she said : ' he would n't say how he got hurt - he was proud of it			2
i went into his room and he was smiling all over			0
' she added that he was only ever visited by ' groups of men ' and left discharged himself having his stitches out			0
police quickly concluded the explosives were planted by a lone - wolf extremist , the 21 - year - old neo-nazi @entity18 ( left ) who died in the attack			1
but there is mounting concern he was aided by accomplices @entity75 , the journalist behind the @entity52 documentary , claims to have evidence that police were forced to eliminate any suggestion of a group attack from the inquiry by then @entity83 prime minister @entity82 , who was bidding to become @entity8 chancellor at the time			1
mr @entity75 claims to have proof that mr @entity82 feared politically damaging accusations that he had failed to tackle a major right - wing extremist group who had initially been implicated in the attack			2
as a result , mr @entity82 - who died in 1988 - instructed investigators to pin the bombing on @entity18 , mr @entity75 alleges			1
six members of the @entity96 paramilitary group called the @entity97 were briefly detained over the atrocity but never charged			0
mr @entity75 told @entity100 newspaper : ' as the evidence mounts , the lone attacker theory is crumbling			2
' the evidence adds further weight to previous claims that unknown co-conspirators may have worked alongside @entity18 which prompted prosecutors to reopen the investigation in december			0
chief prosecutor @entity109 said the investigation would ' pursue all leads ... anew and comprehensively ' adding : ' there is no statute of limitations on murder			0
detonated in a bin by one of the festival 's exit points at the height of the friday night rush , the improvised explosive was made from a hand grenade packed with nails			2
three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular @entity8 beer festival			1
fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that @entity18 had co-conspirators who helped him with the attack @entity18 , described by @entity8 media at the time as a loner and a gun nut , was known to be a supporter of the @entity96 paramilitary group called the @entity97			1
the extreme right - wing militia named after its leader @entity138 , was banned by the @entity8 government			0
but while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved , prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982			0
nonetheless , many victims , local politicians and lawyers have questioned the ' lone attacker ' theory			0
among them was lawyer , @entity152 who told the @entity153 last year that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in september			0
declining to name her , he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding @entity18 as a ' hero of the right ' in a home where she was teaching in @entity164 , a region of central @entity165 located mostly in @entity166			0
she had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims , he said , adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured			1
those witnesses said they had seen @entity18 arguing with other people before the bomb went off			0
the bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in @entity8 after 1945			0
however , throughout the 1970s and 1980s @entity8 saw several far - left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings .			0
