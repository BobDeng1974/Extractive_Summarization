by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:39 pm on 28th june 2011 prisoners should be allowed to buy their way out of jail early , a @entity3 councillor has said			1
@entity7 says non-violent offenders should be able to pay £ 10,000 to have their six - month sentence halved			1
his proposal has won backing from colleagues in @entity13 , @entity14			2
but political opponents have dismissed it as a ' crackpot ' idea			2
former justice secretary @entity19 , the local mp , blasted it as ' totally wrong '			1
cllr @entity7 , left , says prisoners should be able to buy their way out of jail early			2
he has been supported by council leader @entity23 , right he said : ' it 's the kind of thing we oppose in other countries			1
it is the job of the court system to decide the appropriate penalty and the court system should be blind to how deep a person 's pockets are , or it becomes completely unfair			1
' there is also a question of where the criminals have got the money from in the first place			2
' @entity42 , member for the town 's @entity44 ward , claims it would help ease overcrowding in jail , and recoup money to make up for @entity51 cuts , such as closing the front counter at his local police station			1
however , @entity55 of the @entity56 , said : ' i think it 's a crackpot idea that would n't work			1
' most of the people who go to jail do not have the finances to pay for that kind of thing , and as it is , courts struggle to get fines of even £ 25 off people			2
it just does n't work like that			2
' @entity13 mp @entity19 , the former justice secretary , has dismissed @entity7 's proposal to have prisoners pay for early release cllr @entity73 , leader of the for @entity74 , says the idea would not work as people were likely to be paying the fines through criminally - obtained funds			1
he said : ' the better criminal they were , the more money they 'd have available to cut their sentence			2
' rather than getting the criminals to pay with cash , maybe we should get them to work to pay off their sentence			2
' recycling costs the borough a heck of a lot of money , so why do n't we dump all the rubbish in the prison yard and get the criminals to sort it out ? ' @entity42 's letter to the @entity3 members outlining his plan : ' the more i think about the meeting that was held at the @entity102 on tuesday night the more concerned i am about who should actually be expected to hold the burden of the proposed reduction in police funding , which would be as i see it being placed on the public which actually pay now for their services			1
' i think in all honesty this burden should be placed at the law breakers and the criminals			0
' how could this be achieved ? when a non-violent criminal is sentenced , part should be a custodial sentence and part a fine ( ring fenced to go to police funds )			1
' provided the criminal behaves themselves when in prison they will serve the sentence given			0
if they do not behave themselves they will serve a longer sentence			0
' if this is introduced it could well be a win - win situation : not as many criminals stopping in prison longer this will ease the overcrowding , and monies collected will offset the need for cut backs in policing and will be seen in the public eye as making the law breaker pay for the police services			1
' i think that this should be put to our leaders in central government as a way of reducing cut backs			0
' @entity42 made his suggestion in an email to @entity3 members on the @entity13 with @entity44 council			0
he said : ' the law - abiding people in this country are having to take on the problems caused by cutbacks			0
why should we have to do this ? ' the criminals should be made to pay fines for early release			0
' they get time off for good behaviour , so why not allow them the chance to put money back to cover the cuts ? ' it would be win - win			0
there would be less money spent on keeping them in prison , and more money for the police service to keep us safe			0
' the money would definitely have to be ring - fenced to be spent only on covering budget cuts though			0
' @entity42 said his idea would only apply to non-violent crimes such as car theft , drug dealing , people trafficking and fraud			0
he said the amount payable should be decided by government in a unified way depending on the crime , but suggested that a fine of £ 10,000 could halve a six - month sentence			0
@entity42 added : ' a lot of criminals play the system , and some , like drug dealers have a lot of money hidden away that the court never get to know about			1
' but if they could n't come up with the money , then they serve a harder sentence , that 's all			1
' some professional criminals who go from one sentence to another wo n't be bothered about getting off early , but others will			0
' @entity13 with @entity23 leader @entity23 said he supported @entity42 's idea and would be sending it on to ministers			1
he said : ' i think it 's useful			1
we should always try and make criminals pay for their misdemeanours and this would be a way of them contributing back to the community			0
it could also be a way of them contributing to the police			0
' getting criminals to pay for what they have done is all to the good			0

they say it *'ll* help ease overcrowding
' the court system should be blind to how deep a person 's pockets are , ' says @entity19
*critics* say funds might have been criminally obtained
