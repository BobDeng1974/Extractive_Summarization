@entity0 is compiling quite a dvd of video nasties and produced another horror show as @entity4 crashed out of @entity5			1
as he sprung the @entity7 offside trap , @entity0 had three choices : go round goalkeeper @entity9 and roll the ball into an empty net , shoot , or pass to @entity13 to his left to leave the @entity14 with a tap - in			1
any of those would have given @entity4 the lead in the tie			1
instead , he chose secret option four , pass the ball straight at @entity9 in trying to find @entity22			0
@entity23 nutmegs @entity4 goalkeeper and captain @entity25 to open the scoring in the second half of the @entity29 clash @entity30 jumps on the @entity33 forward 's back in celebration after his goal on thursday night in @entity36 @entity38 forward @entity37 doubles @entity7 's lead after some calamitous defending from the visitors former @entity41 forward @entity37 was booked after taking his shirt off in celebration of his goal on thursday the @entity7 players celebrate after scoring the opening goal of the game against @entity4 on thursday night @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity9 6.5 ; @entity49 6 , @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 57 , 6 ) , @entity53 6 ; @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 25 , 6 ) , @entity57 6.5 ; @entity30 6 ( @entity58 84 ) , @entity37 7.5 ; @entity23 7 subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 goals : @entity23 54 , @entity37 71 booked : @entity54 , @entity37 manager : @entity66 7 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity25 6.5 ; @entity67 5 , @entity68 5.5 , @entity69 6.5 ( @entity70 76 ) , @entity71 6 ; @entity72 6 ( @entity73 63 , 6 ) , @entity74 5.5 ; @entity13 6 ( @entity75 63 , 6 ) , @entity76 7 , @entity77 6.5 ; @entity0 5.5 subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 booked : @entity71 manager : @entity84 6 referee : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) 6 attendance : 29,886 @entity89 : @entity37 the look on @entity0 ’s face said it all			1
he was n’t the only one as his team - mates tried to comprehend his decision			0
there was no open goal this time — but in many ways thursday night ’s gaffe was just as bad , if not worse			0
within 15 minutes , @entity0 was trending on @entity100 — above @entity102 ’s slip at the @entity103 on wednesday night			2
had the striker done what a player worth £ 26million should , then @entity4 might still be in the @entity29 this morning			2
instead , they head into sunday ’s @entity109 final against @entity110 on the back of this disappointing defeat			2
however , @entity0 should n’t shoulder all the blame for thursday night ’s defeat			2
@entity115 must also take his share of the flak			0
quite how the giant @entity118 allowed the diminutive @entity37 to outmuscle him in the box before firing @entity7 into a 2 - 0 lead is a question @entity84 — who did n’t look at @entity69 when he was hauled off — will demand answers to			1
everyone , including @entity125 , was looking for clues to @entity84 ’s team selection ahead of sunday ’s @entity129 showdown			0
and the @entity132 , unlike his striker and centre half , did n’t disappoint			0
@entity73 , @entity70 , @entity133 and @entity82 were all left on the bench — a clear indication they will start at @entity129			2
nevertheless , this was a bold team selection by @entity84			0
imagine if @entity76 had limped off ? the decision to start @entity76 was a risk but it nearly paid off inside 12 minutes when he fell in the box under @entity50 ’s rash challenge			0
he appealed for a penalty but to no avail			0
however , replays showed he did have a case			0
it was the talking point of a frenetic opening 20 minutes , which saw @entity76 , @entity148 and @entity57 all fail with long - range efforts			0
@entity4 certainly were n’t overawed , looking to nullify @entity7 ’s away goal in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity152 from the outset			1
and they would have had it in the 29th minute had it not been for @entity0 ’s ineptitude following @entity77 ’s defence - splitting through - ball			1
@entity4 's players trudge back into position after conceding at the @entity161 in @entity36 @entity73 found the back of the net after coming on as a substitute but his effort was correctly ruled out for offside @entity168 , on loan at @entity7 from @entity167 , is tackled by @entity118 defender @entity115 the @entity169 full back , who has said he will return to the @entity171 in the summer , is sent flying by @entity69 's challenge @entity110 loanee @entity37 has five goals in @entity5 competition , all of which have come against @entity169 sides ( three v @entity110 , two v @entity4 ) @entity84 was apoplectic in his technical area			1
‘ why would a striker pass up an opportunity to score ? ’ , he was probably asking himself			2
we ’d all like an answer to that question , @entity84			0
the night plummeted for @entity4 from that moment			2
had @entity87 referee @entity86 pointed to the spot when @entity7 appealed for a penalty , claiming @entity68 had handled @entity23 ’s shot , then @entity4 could easily have been behind by half - time			1
by the 51st minute @entity4 ’s bench was a man down after goalkeeping coach @entity191 was sent to the dressing room after arguing with @entity86			1
and three minutes later they were behind when @entity23 raced through one - on - one with @entity25 after @entity148 ’s defence - splitting pass before coolly slotting home			1
@entity0 and @entity13 race through on the @entity7 goal after a brilliant pass from @entity77 @entity0 and @entity13 looked certain to score when put through on goal but the @entity199 's pass was intercepted the @entity4 duo look on in horror as @entity7 goalkeeper @entity9 dives on @entity0 's weak pass @entity22 and @entity0 react after somehow managing to fluff a glorious opportunity to score in the first half @entity4 's @entity207 midfielder hits his free - kick into the wall during the @entity29 clash on thursday night lesson to @entity0 : when you ’re a striker in a one - on - one , you shoot			1
@entity4 would have been out of the tie had @entity25 not thwarted @entity37 as he raced through on goal in the 61st minute			1
@entity84 sent for the cavalry , introducing @entity73 and @entity75 in search of an equaliser			2
@entity37 ended @entity4 ’s @entity29 campaign in the 71st minute , somehow firing past @entity25 after @entity221 ’s mistake			1
the @entity38 , on loan from @entity110 , flung his shirt off in celebration striking a psychological blow for his employers before the final			2
@entity0 will be lucky to have a shirt to wear at all on sunday			0
was fatigue a factor ? spurs have now played 43 games this season , which is more than any other @entity171 side			0
they will certainly be tired of hearing about one historical statistic that rumbles on – @entity4 have never progressed in @entity5 competition knockout rounds when they have failed to win the first leg at home			2
this was a rare start for @entity168			0
in fact it was only his second since @entity7 ’s december 11			0
in the meantime , he has been an unused substitute eight times , come off the bench twice and had only one start			0
he is understood to want a move back to the @entity171 , with @entity249 and @entity250 keen			0
his @entity167 deal is up in the summer			0
- @entity37 just loves tormenting @entity4 and , indeed , any @entity169 side			1
the on - loan @entity110 attacker , who demolished @entity4 in this competition in 2013 when he was a at @entity41 , scored @entity7 ’s second here and was man of the match			1
he has now scored five in this competition and all five have been against @entity169 sides ( three against @entity110 and two against @entity4 )			1
@entity37 , on loan from @entity171 leaders @entity110 , chases @entity4 full back @entity71 former @entity263 winger @entity77 dribbles with the ball while being tracked by @entity7 's @entity55 former @entity167 midfielder @entity265 closes in on @entity0 during the first half in @entity267 @entity30 intercepts an attempted pass from @entity269 to his team - mate @entity77 at the @entity161 @entity49 chases former @entity270 midfielder @entity76 during the first half of the @entity29 clash @entity4 's star player and top goalscorer @entity73 started on the bench for the @entity29 clash in @entity36 @entity4 manager @entity84 and @entity7 boss @entity276 greet each other before the match a view of @entity7 's ground , the @entity161 , as fans start to filter in before kick - off			1

@entity4 had to score to progress after drawing the first leg of this tie 1 - 1 at @entity152
but @entity0 and @entity13 *conspired* to miss a glorious opportunity in the first half
@entity7 then scored the opener through former @entity292 man @entity23
@entity37 , on loan from @entity110 , doubled the hosts ' lead *shortly* after
@entity73 scored after coming on as a substitute but his effort was correctly ruled out for offside
