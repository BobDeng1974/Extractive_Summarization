@entity0 was left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic a woman who went in to hospital for routine dental surgery has described the hell of being left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic			1
@entity0 had been admitted to have two teeth extracted after developing abscesses			1
the nature of the operation meant she had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body			1
but a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly			1
by the time she realised she had no pain relief , she was powerless to move or scream for help			1
mrs @entity0 says the 40 - minute experience was so horrific she feared she would die of a heart attack on the operating table			1
fully awake - but with her eyes taped shut and with no pain relief - she listened in horror as she heard surgeon asking for the scalpel			1
as it cut into her gum , she passed out with what she assumed was shock			0
telling her story on @entity38 's @entity37 , she said : ' it was supposed to be a routine procedure			0
i had a couple of abscesses on my lower jaw and needed two teeth extracted			1
' because the procedure was urgent , her dentist referred her to her then local hospital in @entity49			2
' i was assured it was a standard day case and i 'd be home by the evening			0
' in fact , it was a catalogue of errors , ' she told presenters @entity56 and @entity57			2
minutes before going into theatre , the anaesthetist had administered something into a tube in the back of her hand and she felt a woozy , relaxed feeling wash over her			0
' i began to feel floaty , but then i was aware of being wheeled into theatre , ' she said			0
' i thought " i 'm not asleep " , but at the same time i could n't move - or see			1
' then i heard the surgeon approach the table and ask the nurse for a metal clamp to keep my mouth open			0
' she screamed - but paralysed by muscle - relaxing drugs , she made no sound			1
' i could feel the surgeon leaning over me and push down on my body before pulling up			0
at this point , he realised her tooth was cracked and coming out in pieces			2
' that was when he asked for the scalpel , ' she recalled			0
' it felt as if my tooth was coming out of my foot , not my mouth			0
a searing pain shot up my body			2
' mrs @entity0 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , added : ' i heard the surgeon declare : " it 's a toughie "			1
using every fibre of strength in her body , she desperately tried to get the surgeon 's attention			0
the nature of the operation meant mrs @entity0 had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body			1
but a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly , she told presenters @entity56 and @entity57 ' he was standing over my right side and i thought if i could just move my right arm to touch him , he would instantly know i was awake			1
' i thought i was going to die - not because of the pain , but the fear			1
i thought i was going to have a heart attack			1
' worryingly , had observations of her pulse and blood pressure been done during the operation - in accordance with the @entity122 ' guidelines - staff would have realised what was going on			1
but mrs @entity0 , now 50 , later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed			1
it also later emerged that the anaesthetist had administered only a dose of atracurium - a commonly used muscle relaxant			2
this was because her mouth needed to be clamped open to extract her teeth			2
professor @entity134 , a clinical psychologist at the the @entity135 , counselled mrs @entity0 for months after her ordeal			2
he estimates between 50 and 80 per cent of patients who are awake during surgery suffer post-traumatic stress disorder			0
it is , he says , similar to being tortured			0
' anaesthesia awareness has caused some of the most severe cases of post-traumatic stress disorder i have seen , ' he said			2
he added it does not matter whether the operation is a major or minor one			0
mrs @entity0 told @entity37 : ' i initially assumed i must have fainted on the operating table			1
' but professor @entity134 says it is common for the brain to erase extremely traumatic images and events such as this			0
' the anaesthetist had assumed , wrongly , that because it was a dental operation , the surgeon would apply a local anaesthetic to the mouth			2
the surgeon , however , drafted in at the last minute because of a list change , had assumed mrs @entity0 had already been given a full general anaesthetic			1
after 37 minutes , the operation ended and she was given another injection to reverse the relaxant			0
' i shot up , desperate to get the ventilator tube out of my throat - i just wanted to gag			2
i was trying to rip it out			0
' as soon as it was out , i screamed " i do n't know what you think you were doing , but i was awake the whole time "			2
a hospital inquiry found the anaesthetist negligent and she received a Â£ 15,000 out - of - court settlement for the incident in 2002			1
but the mother - of - one said the experience had changed her life forever			1
' i changed from an outgoing , laid back person into a woman angry with the whole world , ' she said			2
' thankfully my family , my husband @entity188 , they have all been incredible			0
i was just in pieces			0
' all the time i was on that operating table , thinking they were my last minutes , i was thinking of them			0
' i pictured @entity188 's face , my daughter @entity197 's face			0
@entity188 is a massive @entity200 fan - and we sing together - so i was trying to to remember the words of songs			0
anything to take my mind off the pain			0
' earlier this month , shocking results from a study led by @entity122 and @entity208 were made public			0
but mrs @entity0 , now 50 , later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed			1
the research revealed that 150 people a year in the @entity214 and @entity215 report they have been conscious during surgery - despite being given general anaesthesia			1
around six million general anaesthetics are administered in the @entity214 each year			0
according to the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , between one and two people in 1,000 experience some degree of anaesthetic awareness			1
' anaesthesia is a scientific balancing act , ' said dr @entity225 , an @entity122 spokesman and a consultant anaesthetist			0
' you have to try to ensure pain relief and loss of consciousness while minimising the side - effects of the drugs , such as a reduced supply of oxygen to the blood and the brain			1
' but anaesthetists are highly skilled and while incidents of awareness do happen , they are extremely rare			0

@entity0 had gone into hospital to have two teeth extracted
was told she would be given drugs to paralyse her and general anaesthetic
but breakdown in doctors ' communication meant she did n't get the latter
by the time she realised she had no pain relief , she could n't move or speak
says she feared she would die of fear - induced heart - attack during 40 - min op
later received a small *payout* but says experience has changed her forever
around 2 people in 1,000 experience some degree of anaesthetic awareness
