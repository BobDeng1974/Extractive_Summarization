by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 10:16 est , 5 october 2013 we have all been there : waiting for ages for a bus only for it to eventually come , followed by two more right behind it			0
it 's a cliche because it 's true - and here 's the website that finally proves it			0
designed by web developer @entity12 , the @entity11 shows exactly where buses in the capital are at any given moment			1
with red dots symbolising buses and yellow ones representing bus stops , the map gives live updates about every bus route in the capital buses are bunched in groups on the number nine bus route along @entity28 in west @entity29 would - be passengers can pick their bus route and then see how far away the next bus is from their stop			1
and while using the map will give blessed relief to everyone who 's waited at a bus - stop , looking anxiously up the road wondering where the bus is , it also proves that they really do come in threes ... or even fours			2
mr @entity12 , 33 , came up with the idea after designing a similar live map for the @entity44 , showing where @entity44 trains were			1
someone emailed him out of the blue asking if he would create a map for @entity29 buses , and so he used the same code he 'd written the tube map to design one for buses			1
buses really do all come at once - here , three number 74 buses ( red dots ) are bunched up in @entity58 this screenshot show four buses on the 137 bus route close together on @entity62 in south @entity29 you 've waited ages , and then you spot this ... but @entity12 's website will ease your pain using data from @entity69 ( @entity69 ) 's countdown live bus arrivals service , mr @entity12 created a map showing all the bus stops ( yellow dots ) and buses ( red dots ) with a pop - up menu where you can choose which bus number you 're waiting for			1
data from every bus ' gps is fed into a central system operated by @entity69 , which uses it to calculate each bus ' expected arrival time at each bus stop			0
mr @entity12 's live map uses this information to plot his map			2
unevenly spread : this map of the 63 route through south @entity29 shows a long gap with no buses on it at all the @entity95 - based web developer said he had noticed the phenomenon known as ' bunching ' whereby there are long gaps between buses and then several come at once			1
he said : ' what tends to happen is that the bus at the front has more people to pick up and so gets delayed , while the bus behind it has fewer people to pick up so it gets ahead , which causes them to group together			0
' @entity109 has a whole page devoted to bus - bunching , also known as clumping , convoying or platooning , and has several theories as to why it occurs			0
as well as the most obvious theory , upheld by mr @entity12 , other suggestions include drivers going at different speeds , and drivers adjusting their speed deliberately so that other buses pick up more people than they do			2
the number six bus , which runs along @entity124 and @entity125 , shows buses bunched in places three at once : a grab of the live map for the 131 bus shows bunching in @entity131 a @entity69 spokesman told @entity134 bus bunching did occur and they had staff devoted to regulating gaps that might occur			1
he said : ' we have one main control centre for the bus network and smaller sub-centres where staff have access to real - time information about where the buses are			0
' if there are gaps or hold - ups , the control centre can communicate verbally with the drivers and via a screen to regulate the service			0
' ways of doing this include holding buses at stops , or diverting buses from a route where several buses may have been held up at roadworks and sending them on ahead so there 's a more frequent service for those waiting along the route			0
' there are around 8,500 buses operating in the capital , stopping at 19,000 bus stops , all of which are represented on the map			1
@entity69 says around 2,500 bus stops have dot matrix boards giving countdowns until the next bus , and they plan to increase that number .			2

new @entity11 shows exactly where buses in the capital are
it plots every bus route with red dots for buses and yellow for bus stops
created by @entity12 , 33 , from @entity95 after he did tube map
it proves the phenomenon of bunching , when several buses come at once
