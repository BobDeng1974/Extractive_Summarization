hospital : @entity9 , 22 , pictured with his mother @entity16 , needed drugs to regulate his hormone levels after successfully beating brain cancer			1
however , during a hospital stay nurses forgot to give him his medication a coroner had such grave concerns about the case that she referred it to police			1
yesterday an inquest was told how mr @entity9 died after blunders and neglect by ' lazy and careless ' medical staff at @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
his mother @entity33 , a civil servant told @entity34 that staff tutted at her and repeatedly refused to listen to her concerns that her son had n't been given vital medication			1

doctors told him that , without regular medication to control his fluid levels , he would die			1
when he arrived at hospital for the hip operation , nurses assured the family they would give him his medication and said : ' do n't worry , he 's in good hands – we 'll look after him			1
' but , despite the repeated reminders and insistence by both mr @entity9 and his family , staff failed to give him the tablets and he became severely dehydrated after being refused water			1
in an interview with the @entity95 in 2010 , miss @entity33 said of the nurses who treated him : ' they were lazy , careless and had n't bothered to check his charts and see his medication was essential			1

help : police raced to @entity30 in @entity31 , south @entity32 ( pictured ) but were turned away by staff she then went to the hospital where she found him ' confused and angry ' , shouting at staff and behaving in an uncharacteristically abusive manner			1

you better get here quickly : they 're all standing around the bed getting their stories straight "			0

' he was starting to enjoy his life again , even though he had pains in his hip			0
' @entity9 's mother @entity33 she said she told a nurse who walked past the room that mr @entity9 had not had his medication			1
when miss @entity33 volunteered to return to the hospital should he wake , another nurse allegedly told her : ' you do n't need to do that			2
if he makes noise , i 'll close the door and then he wo n't wake everyone up			0
' she added : ' i later realised that her comment was unbelievable but i was so distraught that it did n't register			2
' the morning of her son 's death , may 28 , 2009 , miss @entity33 arrived at the hospital early to find him delirious with swollen lips and a swollen tongue			1
she recalled : ' i then heard three nurses outside his room and i said : " there 's something wrong with my son			2
he does n't look right			0
" ' the nurse said to me " he had a good night			0
there 's nothing wrong with him and he 's just had breakfast and a chat with us			0
" ' i thought : " how could he have had breakfast ? there 's no evidence ( of breakfast )			0
" ' the nurse carried on her handover then i interrupted again and said : “ he 's not right			0
” ' the other nurse then tutted and said : " she 's already told you he had a good night			2
" and with that the three of them walked off			0
' miss @entity33 said she then noticed that her son had n't been given his medication because the packet was still on the table by his bed			2
she told the locum doctor about her concerns , but the doctor said it would n't do him any harm			1
a doctor doing the rounds then checked on mr @entity9			1
miss @entity33 said : ' he took one look at him then he started calling to everyone “ get in there quickly ”			0
' it suddenly dawned on me he has n't had his medication , has n't had his bloods done , nobody 's given him a drink , nobody 's bothered to put his drip back on him			2
' nobody 's done anything since yesterday afternoon when he became aggressive			0
' she said there was a ' flurry of activity ' and everyone ' had a very sad look on their face ' as they battled to save her son 's life			0
miss @entity33 said : ' the main doctor came out and you could tell he was really angry			2
he said : “ you need to go and see your son			0
” the couple then found their son lying in blood and fluid - soaked sheets and a nurse came in and asked them to help her to change them			0
the same nurse later came into the matron 's office and asked whether they were ' finished ' , adding : ' can i bag him up ? ' the death certificate said mr @entity9 died of a ' water deficit ' and ' hypernatraemia ' – a medical term for dehydration			1

as he waited for the surgery , his life started to return to normal			0
' he was out and about like everybody else , ' said miss @entity33 yesterday			0
' i always used to make him take his tablets for the next morning , just in case he stayed at a friend 's house – and he knew the importance of his medication			2
