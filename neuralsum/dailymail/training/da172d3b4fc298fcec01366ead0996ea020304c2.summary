one of the world 's top modeling agencies has turned to @entity2 in order to scout for new talent			2
as part of its worldwide @entity9 model search , @entity10 , which looks after the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , is calling on any eager future fashion stars to upload their best selfies to @entity2 , using the hashtag # @entity9			1
but , determined not to judge the girls on just the one image , the agency 's vp of scouting , @entity18 , explained to @entity24 that they want each person to create more of a digital portfolio , by posting a series of images which showcase their ' whole personality '			1
as soon as they spotted her beautiful pictures , they flew her out to @entity39 to meet with them blonde hair , blue eyes : @entity43 posted this image of herself without any make - up on in the hopes of being scouted by @entity10 's experts be yourself : model @entity49 , who was recently signed to @entity10 after they noticed her potential via @entity2 , advised other budding fashion stars to avoid using too many filters in their own selfies ' @entity2 allows us to see potential models ' natural beauty in their everyday lives , ' she said			1
' they no longer have to spend lots of money on photo shoots or portfolios			0
instead , they can come directly to us with simple smartphone snapshots and a lot of enthusiasm			0
' while the agency will not yet reveal whether it has successfully signed any of the would - be @entity2 models to its books , the official @entity2 account says that it has already scouted ' dozens ' of girls via social media			1
ms @entity18 also admitted that @entity10 has received more than 14,000 submissions from young women who are eager to join its books			0
fresh - faced : many of the girls include a variety of submissions on their @entity2 accounts , in order to showcase a variety of different looks lookalike : after being scouted on @entity2 , model @entity86 was quickly catapulted to stardom , with many commented on her similarities with fellow @entity10 model @entity91 it is hoped that the idea of a social media model search might one day become a widely - accepted means of finding new talent - not least because it saves the agencies from having to send their scouts abroad in order to meet with potential models			1
' we 've been scouting via social for a while now and have developed proprietary methods to help us identify the best possible talent , ' ms @entity18 added			0
' those methods are now informing special tools we 're building in - house that will help us move quickly and decisively while tracking thousands of accounts			0
' the @entity2 account , which is run by ms @entity18 and her colleagues , has now amassed nearly 12,000 followers - however thus far only a hand full of carefully - selected @entity2 submissions have been chosen to feature on the account			2
strike a pose : in some cases , the girls have gone back through their existing @entity2 images in order to add the @entity122 hashtag going global : thus far @entity10 have received more than 14,000 submissions from around the world , including @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 the perfect pout : @entity130 captioned this image ' bonjour ' before later adding the @entity134 tag new @entity10 model @entity135 is quoted on the account , which details her reaction to being scouted : ' i could n't believe it ! literally not until i spoke to @entity18 on the phone i realized that i was given such amazing opportunity ! ‚Äù @entity10 are certainly not the first to turn to social media as a means of finding models - although this campaign is believed to be one of the biggest ever run			1
both @entity146 and @entity147 have held casting calls on @entity2 in the past , with @entity146 opting to use the social media platform in order to choose girls for both its @entity152 and @entity153 2015 campaigns			2
' it seemed like a great idea to me , as casting through @entity2 seemed cool , current and strong , ' @entity146 told @entity158 after his fall campaign was unveiled			0
' we wanted the ads to shout with youth and energy ... to be fresh and reclaim the spirit that the collection had when we first conceived of it - to be another collection , not a second line			0
' multi-talented : @entity10 praised model @entity169 for her ability to pull of any look @entity174 trotter : the 21 - year - old @entity175 was flown out to @entity39 to meet with @entity10 scouts and now lives and works in the @entity177 pretty and petite : @entity178 was convinced that she was too short to ever be taken seriously as a model			2

the initiative is the work of @entity10 , who look after @entity12 , @entity185 and @entity13
girls have been asked to create @entity2 - based portfolios , using the hashtag # @entity189 , which will showcase their ' whole personality '
