this sea lion is one of the regulars at a fishery as she stands on her flippers patiently queuing up for her fish supper			1
the cheeky mammal made her way from the sea to the fish stall and waited for her turn for an hour			2
after being given scraps of fish by the generous fishmonger , the sea lion made her way back to the sea			1
the 38 - year - old @entity25 took the fishy photographs at a port a herring 's throw from the sea			2
mr @entity23 said : ' the sea lion is looking for fish scraps left over from the filleting process which is usually found in the fishing port			1
' after you @entity35 ' , ' no , after you , @entity37 ' : the sea lion patiently waits her turn as another customer is served the locals may chat to their fishy friend but they are careful not to touch them or interact with them beyond common courtesy ' i would get that portion			1
it smells delicious to me ' : the sea lion sniffs out what may be that night 's dinner ' hmm , what shall i have today ? what 's on the menu ? ' the sea lion peruses the specials of the day ' i found it very interesting , i really enjoyed the moment because it 's like the sea lion is a customer			1
' i expected to find wildlife in large quantity ; it was so surprising to see that the animals there are not afraid of humans			0
' it was so funny to observe how it was standing on its back flippers			0
having given the fishmonger her order , the sea lion waits watches as he prepares her day 's meal ' the sea lion was standing for about an hour			1
it took several fish scraps and later jumped back into the sea			0

' the fishing stall is close to the sea , just 2½ metres away , and there is a raised platform 1½ metres above the surface of the water			0
' will this do for madam ? or should i cut it in half for you ? ' only the best offcuts for the sea lion ' to return to the water , it just jumps in			2
' mr @entity23 said that this is n't a big deal for people who live there , he said : ' for locals it 's normal			0
' they are accustomed to the proximity of the wildlife , but they never touch the animals nor interact with them			0
' i especially love the photos that show the harmony between man and animals , as a result of the respect for the wildlife in this community			0
