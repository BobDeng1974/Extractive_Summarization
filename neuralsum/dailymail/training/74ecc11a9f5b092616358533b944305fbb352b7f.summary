by @entity0 published : 04:13 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 07:49 est , 3 march 2014 a mother - of - three has credited being obese with saving her life - after routine scans before weight loss surgery revealed a massive cancerous tumour on her left ovary			1
@entity8 , 45 , was 22 stone and a size 26 when she decided to book the bariatric surgery			1
she said : ' i ’ll always be thankful that i decided to have the operation			1
if i had n't , my ovarian cancer would never have been discovered and i would n’t be here today			2
' obese : at a size 26 and weighing 22 stone , @entity8 decided to undergo weight loss surgery in the @entity18 lucky : but a routine ultrasound before her weight loss surgery revealed a 17cm cancerous tumour on her left ovary after struggling to control her weight gain for years , ms @entity25 , an accountant from @entity28 , @entity29 , decided to have surgery to lose weight once and for all			1
she said : ' i ’d always been a big girl			2
over the years i ’d tried every diet under the sun and would lose weight only to put it all back on again			2
' i was stuck in a vicious cycle i just could n’t break			2
' i knew if i had any chance of losing weight i ’d have to have surgery			1
i realised i would n’t be eligible to have surgery on the @entity43 but i could n’t afford to get it done privately in the @entity45			1
' luckily i discovered a @entity45 company which sends patients abroad for surgery , which was a much cheaper option			1
' after seeking advice from her private consultant , ms @entity8 decided to have a gastric wrap , which transforms the stomach into a narrow tube , restricting the amount of food patients can eat			1
shock : ms @entity8 ( before her operation ) said : ' the consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries , and i had to go back to the @entity45 and see my gp straight away ' in november 2011 she flew to the @entity18 to have her surgery , having used all of her £ 5,500 savings to fund the operation			1
she said : ' i had mixed emotions , i was nervous but determined and excited , too			2
' in the back of my mind i did wonder if the whole thing was too good to be true			2
i had phoned the clinic a few times and found it hard to get through , so i was wary , but i went anyway			2
' the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise , especially in the early stages of the disease			2
this is because the symptoms are often very similar to those of less serious conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome			2
the most common symptoms are an increase in abdominal size and persistent bloating , persistent pelvic or abdominal pain , and difficulty eating			1
other symptoms include back pain , frequent urination , loss of appetite , nausea , unexplained weight gain , changes to bowel habits and pain during sex			0
some patients also experience abnormal vaginal bleeding			0
before seeing the consultant , ms @entity25 had a series of pre-operation checks , including a routine ultrasound			1
she said : ' the consultant told me he had discovered a mass near my ovaries , and i had to go back to the @entity45 and see my gp straight away			0
' i was in a state of confusion			0
i was dozy from the drugs and found it hard to understand exactly what the surgeon was saying because of the language barrier			0
' on her arrival back in @entity120 , ms @entity8 was referred to a gynecologicalcancer specialist and underwent an ultrasound , @entity123 and ct scan			1
she said : ' the oncologist told me i had a tumour on my left ovary			1
i was in shock but tried not to fear the worst			0
' i just did n’t understand how i could have cancer when i had no symptoms at all			0
i did n’t feel ill. ' on december 15th 2011 , she underwent a two - hour operation during which a 17cm cancerous tumour was removed , and she had a hysterectomy			1
ms @entity8 , who has children aged 21 , 20 and 14 , said : ' luckily the cancer had n’t spread			1
i was told i did n’t need to have chemotherapy , just regular checkups for five years			0
' i thanked my lucky stars the cancer had been discovered early			0
i told friends that my tummy had saved my life			0
' after recovering from an infection , ms @entity8 decided that she still wanted to go ahead with the weight loss surgery			1
on april 24th 2012 she flew back to the @entity18 for the procedure			1
relief : after successful surgery to remove the tumour , ms @entity8 later underwent gastric bypass surgery and has since lost 7 stone she said : ' the operation went to plan			1
i had to have liquids for two weeks before introducing tiny portions of mushy food into my diet			0
' ms @entity25 also changed her diet drastically			0
having habitually snacked on crisps , chocolate and cakes , she swapped to porridge for breakfast , soup for lunch and meat and vegetables for dinner			0
by january 2013 she had lost seven stone			1
today she weighs 15st 7lb and can fit into size 16 clothes			2
she said : ' i 've felt better than i have in years			0
i have more energy and i ’m able to wear the kind of clothes i ’d always dreamed of			0
i feel like a different person			0
' i used to dress in black and try and cover myself up , but now i have a wardrobe full of coloured , fitted dresses , which i wear with pride			0
' i ’m so grateful my cancer was caught early			0
i now intend to live life to the full			0
