by @entity0 last updated at 7:42 pm on 3rd february 2012 the last picture of writer @entity2 in a @entity4 bar , taken the evening before he died after becoming involved in an altercation with a hotel barman the family of a @entity9 writer and former army officer who died last month in @entity4 fear the @entity12 police are seeking to cover - up his murder or manslaughter			1
@entity2 , 70 , who penned a book on climbing in the @entity17 mountains , was staying at a large tourist hotel when a late night and unexplained altercation with a barman and a subsequent fall evidently led to his death			1
in a plot that could have come straight out of a @entity26 thriller he became involved in a mysterious late night altercation with a hotel barman and a subsequent fall is believed to have led to his death			1
but police have showed little enthusiasm for fully probing events around the incident and an investigation launched by his ex-wife @entity35 , 57 , and son @entity37 , has raised some probing questions			1
mrs @entity35 fears a cover - up may be underway to protect the reputation of the @entity42 hotel , built for the @entity43 and one of the largest in @entity4			1
the family have now abandoned plans to have the author 's remains cremated in @entity4 and have brought his body back for a new autopsy in @entity9			1
as a result , their suspicions have only deepened over the fate of a healthy man who seemed ten or more years younger than his age , authored authoritative book @entity58 's guide to @entity17 , and is known to have met members of the @entity60			1
' @entity4 police now claim it was not a crime , and have ruled out any criminal investigation , ' said @entity64 - born @entity35 , who remained a close friend after her divorce from the writer			1
she went to @entity4 on behalf of the family to collect his belongings but immediately became deeply concerned over the circumstances of his death			2
' i am not satisfied with what the police say , but i am at a loss what to do next			1
' with the help of the @entity80 , she went to the mortuary where she was at first blocked from seeing mr @entity2 ' body			1
finally , she persuaded the director to let her in , and she was given one minute but banned from taking pictures			2
' to say i was shocked is to say nothing , ' she said			2
' i had read all the news stories on the web about his death , and so i knew he had fallen and received head injuries			2
' but i could not imagine such a hole in his temple			2
i could have easily put all my five fingers inside it			2
' it had dried blood all over it and when my eyes moved further i saw another hole right on the top of his head , also huge , large enough to insert my hand had i wanted to			2
' she met the police investigator - ' she was a very young woman , aged 20 i think , and i could hardly believe my eyes			1
i 'm sure it is easy to influence somebody so young			2
' she showed me the short handwritten note in the official file where @entity2 's injuries were described			1
' i could hardly read the scrawl			2
it was in bad handwriting and just several lines long			0
i was not allowed to make a copy of it			0
the only thing the investigator added was that when doctors turned @entity2 's head left and right after his death , the blood kept pouring out			1
' @entity35 , ex-wife of author @entity2 , at the @entity125 in @entity4 , where the travel writer died			1
mrs @entity35 fears a cover - up may be underway to protect the reputation of the @entity42 hotel earlier , this month the police decided against any legal action against barman @entity132 , who was initially detained			1
' suspicions about him have all been dropped , ' said mr @entity2			0
further , the @entity12 authorities insisted that the writer died from a heart attack and there was no need to open a murder investigation surrounding his death			1
after seeking legal advice in @entity12 , the family abandoned plans for a @entity4 cremation and sent the body back to @entity9 to check the results of the @entity12 autopsy			1
' we were told that @entity2 really died from a serious heart attack but that this was highly likely to have been caused by his head wounds , ' said @entity35			0
' so the question is how he got these wounds			0
did he fall down or did somebody attack him leading to his death ? this is what the @entity9 doctors can not tell us			1
' the @entity9 autopsy , the full results of which will go to an inquest in @entity9 , found that it would be surprising if he got both head wounds from a fall , it is understood			1
' if he was assaulted and this led to his death , it could be manslaughter , " said the victim 's @entity167 was another deep shock for the family			2
' the second autopsy revealed one of @entity2 's kidneys was taken out in @entity12			1
i am not sure why and if they had any right to do so , ' said @entity35			0
one @entity12 suggestion fed to the local media , but not officially confirmed by police , is that after midnight mr @entity2 had climbed onto the bar and fallen , apparently the worse for drink			1
yet @entity35 and several @entity12 friends suggest that such behaviour was entirely out of character , and that he was not a heavy drinker though enjoying the occasional beer			1
the hotel has admitted that the 70 year old man did not buy drinks at the bar before the episode happened			2
attempts by the family to view @entity199 footage of the incident and eye - witness statements taken by police are getting nowhere , despite the involvement of the @entity80			2
next , while he evidently received the serious injuries at the hotel bar , rather than summon medical help , there is evidence that mr @entity2 was carried by security hotel men to his room where he was later found to be dead			2
' i am very worried that they say it was just an accident , not a murder , because nobody wants it to be a murder , neither the hotel , nor the police , maybe even for some political reasons because it could disrupt relations , ' said @entity35			1
having visited the @entity4 bar , she insisted : ' it is not possible to get such injuries when you just fall down			0
' and i never ever saw him badly drunk			0
he could drink a pint of but always controlled himself			0
' he was a true gentleman			0
i ca n't imagine him starting a fight , especially in a public place like hotel			2
he was a very tall and strong man , and surely he would not let anybody abuse him			0
' if this happened he would have replied with something strong and maybe rude in return , but no fighting , no way			0
' another intriguing question is why mr @entity2 was in @entity4			0
he returned to it year after year on regular trips to the @entity12 capital			1
could he have , perhaps unwittingly , crossed somebody ? one theory is that he was writing a travel book			0
another suggestion from a @entity4 cafe owner that he often frequented was that he enjoyed the company of younger @entity12 women who he sometimes entertained to meals			1
' @entity2 had a passion for @entity12			1
he liked its cool climate and the people , ' said @entity35 , who did not think he was romantically involved in @entity12 or had business dealings			1
taxi driver @entity255 , 52 , said he had known mr @entity256 for around 14 years since his first visit to @entity4			0
' i was the person who knew him best , ' he said , explaining they shared a drink together on the eve of his death			0
' both of us were ex-army men			0
i served in the @entity267 special forces in the @entity268			1
for some reason @entity2 did n't talk about his military career			0
' i do n't know if was involved in business as well as writing , he never told me , i only know he liked to collect impressions about places			0
' @entity2 was a cheerful and curious person			0
he liked @entity12 , and was interested in understanding @entity12 people			1
i am not exactly sure of the purposes of his previous visits here , but he came twice a year , every spring and every autumn , and stayed for a couple of weeks			0
' a lover of the beauty of the @entity17 mountains , it seems , incongruously , that the bleak @entity4 cityscape also held attractions for him			0
' he was very constant about the places he liked			0
he kept coming back to the same hotel and bars , even the same pond and park			1
' but the driver was always left wondering : why ? at the final meeting , mr @entity255 took a picture of the author who had a strange request for him			0
' he was very keen in seeing the cheapest entertainment places where the rougher kind of @entity4 and guest workers were staying , ' he said			0
' i do n't know why he wanted this and i did n't take him , explaining it may not be safe			0
' the driver is adamant that mr @entity2 - a former army physical training instructor - would not have got into a fight			0
' i never saw him badly drunk			0
not a single time , ' he said			0
' he was never was aggressive , impatient or anything like this towards me or any other people i saw him with			0
he was tall , well over six foot , a gentle giant			0
' hotel deputy director @entity309 said it was up to police to determine what had happened			1
' it is not clear at all why mr @entity2 came down to this bar at 1 am , ' he said			0
@entity4 police said there was no evidence to open a criminal investigation .			2

ex-wife believes police might be trying to protect reputation of hotel
