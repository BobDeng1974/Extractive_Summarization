@entity1 boss @entity0 is predicting @entity3 ’s return to fitness will transform his side ’s season - as the @entity7 club set their sights on a move for @entity10			1
@entity11 striker @entity3 last kicked a ball for @entity1 152 days ago but , having recovered from a serious thigh problem , he will be included in the squad for saturdays @entity16 home clash with @entity17			1
@entity0 has suffered without having a striker who can intensely press defenders , but @entity3 will give him that presence and @entity1 are looking to supplement that by moving for @entity21 ’s @entity10			1
@entity1 are also keen to sign @entity21 striker @entity10 during this january transfer window @entity10 ( right ) is also attracting interest from @entity24 and @entity26 outfit @entity25 @entity24 and @entity25 are among a number of clubs to express an interest in 22 - year - old @entity10 , who will be a free agent at the end of the current campaign , but @entity1 are looking to trump their rivals and secure a deal for him now			1
if they are successful , @entity10 would be immediately loaned back to @entity21 to help them in their fight to stay in the top flight before moving to @entity7 in the summer , like @entity40 , who is on loan back at @entity42			1
@entity0 said there were ‘ one or two things ’ he would like to do if possible before the window closes but a more immediate concern is the return of @entity3			2
‘ he will bring something really creative and quality to the team , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity3 not playing has had a huge impact			2
over the last number of months we have nailed down a way of working and when @entity3 is put in that it shines a different light on it			2
‘ he has been fast , dynamic , sharp			0
but we have to be careful			0
we ca n’t expect him to be the saving grace straight away			0
’ @entity1 boss @entity0 ( right ) is relishing the return of striker @entity3 @entity3 ( right ) has missed the majority of the season through injury , but is back training with the @entity65 @entity3 spent three weeks over @entity66 in @entity67 and @entity68 , where he worked with specialists to bolster his left thigh muscle			1
the time away from @entity71 gave him a sense of perspective			0
‘ it has been a learning curve , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ they have allowed me to learn something , ( being on the sidelines ) has been great for the mental side of the game			0
‘ i have improved that and now i am very , very anxious to get out there and play			0
i do n’t know what people ’s expectations are			0
i can only speak for my expectations , which are to work hard , score goals and create chances			0
if the team plays well it is enough for me			2
’ @entity3 is expected to be included in the squad for @entity92 home clash with @entity17 @entity3 ( left ) played an integral role as @entity1 finished second in the @entity16 last season			1
