@entity0 , the staunch @entity1 boyfriend of 19 kids and counting star @entity3 , 21 , has been forced to delete an @entity5 rant he posted to his @entity7 page last week , after it caused a social media storm , reports @entity10			1
the 19 - year - old , from @entity12 , @entity13 , vented his ' problem ' with the catholic faith , slamming the religion for suggesting that @entity18 ' mother @entity17 was a ' sinless being , ' and quoting scripture to support his views			1
' where [ @entity30 ] depart from @entity31 , i will in no way support , but will call them out because i love them and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors , ' the frothy diatribe read			2
' i know a lot of @entity30 who are great people			2
what i do have a problem with is the teaching that man can merit @entity46 ’s favor through his own works or the works of other fallen men			2
' it continued : ' i do have a problem with the teaching that man can come to @entity46 through @entity17 or any other person besides @entity18			2
i do have a problem with the deification of @entity17 as a sinless being			2
' @entity17 herself admitted her need for a savior			0
if she had no sin , she would need no @entity59			0
' readers were quick to respond to @entity0 's post - not the first aggressive religion rant he has shared to the social media site			1
' @entity0 is the worst			1
he is just the worst , ' one user commented			0
' this kind of ‘ christian love ’ is one of the most sickening sentiments on the planet			0
' it ’s demeaning , it ’s condescending , it ’s self - aggrandizing and it turns my stomach			0
' next level : the new status of their relationship permits the @entity81 , @entity13 couple to finally hold hands many users pointed out the various errors in his @entity31 references , with one writing : ' you post your almighty preachings as if you know the real truth			1
' where [ @entity30 ] depart from @entity31 , i will in no way support , but will call them out because i love them and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors ' ' but , then people point out your numerous mistakes , you take your post down or just erase all the negative things			1
grow up boy and face the truth			0
' not long afterwards , mr @entity0 did indeed erase the post			1
he has since shared a post about ' abortion			2
@entity110 's @entity109 , ' - another one of his preferred subjects to proselytize			0
he followed this up with a somewhat less inflammatory passage of advice , which reads : ' as followers of @entity18 , we know the compassion he has shown us - show that to others			0
may @entity46 shine through us to brighten another 's world			0
' lost in prayer : the @entity46 - loving couple , @entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) met at church and started dating shortly after family portrait : @entity124 ( center right ) once said of his 19 - strong brood , ' people think we are overpopulating the world [ but ] we are following our convictions ' according to the @entity132 's views on dating , @entity3 and @entity0 are just ' courting ' for now , which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates			1
the @entity132 , from @entity138 , @entity13 , see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families			1
only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time , but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss			0
the @entity124 family are considered representative of the @entity157 movement which teaches that ' children are @entity46 ’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given			1
' addressing their critics , @entity124 once said : ' people think we are overpopulating the world [ but ] we are following our convictions			0

@entity0 , 19 , has since deleted the post following a storm of criticism
both the @entity132 and mr @entity0 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , are *member* of the @entity157 movement
the @entity132 stars on the popular @entity179 reality series @entity132
