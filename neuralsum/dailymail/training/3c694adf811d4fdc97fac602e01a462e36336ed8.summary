' the main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures or fits but there are many different types , depending on the area of the brain affected			2
these can occur when a person is awake or asleep			0
doctors classify seizures by how much of the brain is affected			0
partial ( or focal ) seizures affect a small part of the brain and generalised seizures affect most or all of the brain			0
some seizures are unclassified because they fit neither category			0
if you see someone having a seizure , there are some simple steps you can take to help			0
if the person is suffering from convulsions , wait until they stop and then put them into the recovery position until they have recovered			2
it is not usually necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure , but you should call 999 if : the seizure has not stopped after five minutes , the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between , you know it is the person 's first seizure , the person is injured , has breathing problems , or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason or if the person â€™s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe			2
a seizure that lasts longer than 30 minutes or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between is called @entity147			0
this is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible			0
you can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy , but if you have n't had any training , it is important to call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus			1
