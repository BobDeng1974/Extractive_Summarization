by @entity0 @entity2 legend @entity1 has branded the club ’s record signing @entity5 ‘ a problem ’ the day after president @entity6 pledged to improve @entity8 ’s contract and make him the world ’s top earner			1
' the problem that @entity2 have now is @entity5 , ' said the former @entity13 star			2
' he is a great player , that is not in question but you can not sign a 21 - year - old and pay him more than players who have won everything there is to win			1
no - one is @entity22 when they are just 21 years old			0
' the comments will further embarrass @entity2 who have long maintained that @entity5 ’s salary is below that of other established stars			1
problem child : @entity5 ( centre ) in training with @entity2 team - mates @entity33 ( left ) and @entity8 @entity22 delusion : @entity5 is being paid more than other @entity2 stars , claims former boss @entity1 not the big star : @entity5 ( right ) will never be the main man at @entity2 while they still have @entity8 in the thick of it : @entity1 says @entity2 's decision to pay @entity5 ( centre ) so well could lead to things going ' wrong ' ever since @entity5 joined the club in the summer there have been whispers that the € 40m sum paid to his parents company @entity46 was a way of paying the @entity48 a higher wage while avoiding upsetting the dressing room			1
@entity1 ’s comments , made in @entity52 at the @entity54 awards , will sow the seeds of doubt again among the club ’s supporters			0
@entity5 ’s contract guarantees him a wage of just under € 11m a year well below the € 17m that @entity8 earns and on a par with @entity2 ’s second tier of top earners such as @entity64 and @entity65			1
but he also received an € 8.5m signing on fee and if the € 40m paid to @entity46 is divided over the five years of his contract his take home pay takes him close to @entity8 and well beyond @entity2 's @entity71 internationals who , as @entity1 points out , have won everything in the game			1
@entity1 added : ' when you already have the best player in the world a player of just 21 years can not be the big star – with 26 maybe but not at 21			0
it is a shame because @entity5 is a great player but if the situation continues like this things could go wrong			2
' focal point : @entity8 is @entity2 's star man , highest earner and record goalscorer leveller : @entity5 's earnings are on a par with those of @entity2 legends @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 @entity1 , one of @entity2 ’s greatest ever players who also managed their ' @entity2 ' side that won the @entity93 at @entity94 in 1992 , rarely holds back when asked about his former club and even more so since falling out with @entity96 , the club ’s president for most of this season until he stepped down			1
@entity96 even stripped @entity1 of an honorary president title bestowed on him by another former president @entity100			0
he has also stopped going to the @entity101 since @entity96 replaced @entity100 in 2010			0
@entity1 famously said of @entity5 when the club signed him : ' you can not have two captains on one boat ' hinting a possible clashes ahead between @entity108 ’s @entity107 and @entity2 ’s @entity109			2
@entity1 also spoke about the decision of @entity111 to leave @entity2			0
he said : ' @entity111 left @entity2 because the directors were interfering with his decisions			0
' legend : @entity1 played and managed @entity2 , leading their ' @entity2 ' to the 1992 @entity93			0

you ca *n't* *buy* a 21 - year - old and pay him more than winners - @entity1
@entity2 insist @entity5 is paid less than established stars
@entity5 can not be the main man at @entity2 while @entity8 is around
things could go wrong , warns @entity1
