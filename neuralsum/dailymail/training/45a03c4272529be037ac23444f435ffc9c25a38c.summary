by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:20 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 12 september 2013 @entity2 today tore into the @entity3 for offering @entity5 footballer pay deals to top staff			1
the deputy prime minister warned the @entity9 ’s reputation has been ‘ badly tarnished ’ by the spectacle of executives trying to dodge the blame for signing off severance deals worth up to £ 1million			1
he said the use of taxpayers ’ money to lavish huge salaries on @entity3 bosses meant they now had a ‘ mountain to climb ’ to restore public trust			1
on monday , seven current and former @entity3 chiefs were called before mps to explain why it handed £ 369million in severance deals to its staff , including £ 25million to 150 top managers			1
during almost three hours of furious questioning in @entity36 , former director - general @entity37 and @entity38 repeatedly contradicted each other , notably over a £ 1million settlement for ex-deputy director - general @entity41			0
mps demanded to know why mr @entity41 received double the £ 500,00 to which he was contractually entitled			2
the executives were called back to @entity36 after giving different accounts about how the deals were agreed , and mr @entity37 , now chief executive of the @entity47 , challenging claims by the @entity49 that they were kept in the dark			0
tense : mr @entity37 ( circled left ) was placed five seats away from @entity49 chairman @entity38 , with whom he is at loggerheads over whether the @entity49 knew about the payments mr @entity2 condemned the size of the pay deals funded from the licence fee : ‘ these are figures are just very , very high			1
' this is taxpayers ’ money going into the @entity3 and they ca n’t in a sense treat these payoffs like you might treat a pay - off for a @entity5 footballer			1
' they ’re not in that category			0
these are public servants at the end of the day so i do think actually the @entity3 ’s reputation - and i say this with real sorrow because i am a huge defender and advocate of the @entity3 - but the reputation ’s been pretty badly tarnished this week			1
' speaking on his @entity78 radio phone - in , mr @entity2 said this week ’s committee hearing had rocked his faith in the @entity9			2
‘ i ’m a big , big supporter of the @entity3			1
it ’s recognised around the world as being an organisation that produces great drama , great programming , great news , ’ he said			0
‘ but i have to say that they have n’t covered themselves in glory with one bit of the @entity3 saying one thing , the other bit saying something			1
‘ the left hand does n’t seem to know what the right hand is saying			1
’ defiant : @entity37 became increasingly animated during the grueling three - hour committee grilling dispute : @entity49 chairman @entity38 blamed a ' culture ' of extravagance at the corporation which was used to justify huge pay and perks kicking off monday 's committee evidence session , ms @entity103 said it was an ' extraordinary occasion ' for seven former and serving @entity3 executives to have to be called back to @entity36			1
mr @entity37 and @entity38 were called to appear with @entity3 hr director @entity108 , @entity109 , the former chairman of the @entity3 @entity110 , @entity3 director @entity111 , @entity3 trustee @entity112 and former @entity49 chairman sir @entity113			2
ms @entity103 said she hoped to ' establish on behalf of both the public and licence - fee payer who knew what and at what time and who is responsible for decisions taken by the @entity3 '			2
she said the deals led to ‘ grossly excessive payments which most people now consider to be unacceptable ’			2
one caller challenged mr @entity2 over whether the pay - offs breached the @entity125 , but the @entity126 insisted ‘ any allegations of criminality [ are ] something for the police ’			1
‘ but the wider point about needing to restore public trust in the way in which the @entity3 is run , the way in which people are remunerated , the way in which are paid off at the end of their contracts … ‘ just to state the flaming obvious : the @entity3 have now got quite a mountain to climb to restore public trust in the way these things are handled			1
’ his comments come after culture secretary @entity146 said the payouts raise ‘ serious questions ’ about the judgement of those in charge at the @entity3			1
in a major speech to the @entity153 last night , mrs @entity146 said : ‘ monday was a grim day for its senior management			0
‘ there is a risk of events like this overshadowing the unstinting work of its staff			0
‘ this must not be allowed to happen			0
the corporate dramas of the @entity3 should never eclipse its actual dramas			2
’ in a further sign of government pressure on the @entity3 to get its house in order , she cleared the way for the @entity172 to probe any area of its extravagant spending ‘ without hindrance or delay ’			1
she also warned that the @entity49 structure remained under constant review			0
but mr @entity2 today insisted he did not back the idea of axing the @entity49 and handing regulation of the @entity3 to @entity181			1
he added : ‘ the trust now needs to work very hard indeed and urgently to restore confidence in the way in which it discharges its duties			0
’ defensive : former director - general @entity37 said he increased the pauout to @entity189 by almost £ 500,000 to keep him focused on his job ex-director - general @entity37 today claimed his friend and deputy @entity41 needed to be paid £ 949,000 to remain ' focussed ' on his job at the @entity3			1
mps demanded to know why the huge sum was agreed , when contractually mr @entity41 was only entitled to £ 500,000			2
mr @entity37 denied there was any ' favouritism ' in his decision to agree the deal			0
mr @entity37 told the committee that in his view mr @entity41 's severance package represented ' value for money ' and he explained that he had been under ' ferocious pressure ' from the @entity49 to make savings			2
as part of the extraordinary deal , it was decided in october 2010 that mr @entity41 would not be told formally that he was being made redundant until april the following year , allowing him to continue drawing on his salary			0
mr @entity37 said the huge sum was needed because the @entity3 wanted mr @entity41 to be ' fully focused ' on his work during his last months in the job and not ' worried about his future '			2
but former @entity49 chairman sir @entity113 agreed with the @entity193 that payments like mr @entity41 's ' look eye - watering ' and he warned the @entity49 had been ' damaged ' but the crisis			0
grilling : @entity49 chairman @entity38 walks through the houses of @entity36 to the hearing at the @entity217 @entity38 said he had been repeatedly told the £ 949,000 deal for @entity41 to leave the @entity3 was ' contractual ' and ' standard '			1
the @entity49 chairman told the committee : ' i am in a slightly difficult position because i became chairman of the trust six months after the @entity227 payment			0
' i 'm accused of having misled the committee on something that i never knew and could n't have been expected to know			0
' he said he had been through his induction pack from may 2011 and subsequent briefings , and there was no mention of the controversial severance payments			0
one briefing ahead of a press conference stated : ' these were contractual payments which were essential in order to slim down the executive board			0
' @entity38 complained that it is ' @entity37 's contention ' that he should somehow have deduced that the payment to mr @entity41 was in excess of his contractual minimum			0
he blamed a ' cultural issue ' for the slate of payouts at the corporation which ' we do have to recognise and apologise for and deal with very robustly '			0
he said one of his first jobs was a meeting to discuss executive pay where he made ' a very simple point that the best cultural director in the world , @entity256 , got £ 180,000 a year for running the @entity258			0
how many people at the @entity3 get paid more than that and how can we justify that ? '			1
@entity38 cast doubt on a proposal that communications watchdog @entity181 should regulate the corporation , saying : ' i ca n't imagine handing the regulatory power to @entity181 and @entity181 wanting to be involved in remuneration			0

deputy prime minister warns @entity3 's reputation has been ' badly tarnished '
@entity2 : ‘ left hand does n’t seem to know what the right hand is saying '
