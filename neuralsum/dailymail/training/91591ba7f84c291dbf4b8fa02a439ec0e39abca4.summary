when a camera trap set up on the banks of @entity5 ’s @entity4 ’s @entity3 went missing earlier this year , local rangers assumed it had fallen into the water			1
yet three weeks later the camera was found almost 65 miles upriver and the footage revealed it had actually been stolen by a sea eagle			1
the wings of the eagle are shown flapping during the one - minute clip before the bird lands and pecks at the screen			1
a sea eagle , in particular the @entity19 variety , is also known as an ' erne ' or ' ern '			1
the birds vary in size from around 6lb to almost 20lbs			0
their diets consist mainly of fish and small mammals			0
the last @entity27 sea eagle was shot in 1916 and the species disappeared from the wild for over 50 years but they are now thriving			1
species are found across @entity31 , @entity5 and @entity32			0
the @entity33 , including @entity34 , set up the trap to capture footage of saltwater crocodiles in @entity5			1
on a routine check of the traps , mr @entity34 noticed the camera had gone missing and assumed it had been washed away			2
a passer - by called the rangers three weeks later to say they had found the camera around 65 miles upriver from where the trap was set			1
once mr @entity34 examined the footage he discovered that a juvenile sea eagle had picked up the camera , flown for around 20 seconds before landing and pecking the screen			1
the first shots show the wings of the bird flapping as it flies along the river , it is then placed on the rocks on the river bed before capturing the full face of the winged thief			0
‘ unexpectedly our camera went missing , ’ @entity34 told @entity60 , ‘ we thought that it had fallen into the water but a juvenile sea eagle came and took - off with it			1
’ it is not the first time birds have been caught interacting with cameras in the wild			0
in august a colony of @entity72 penguins tried to pick up a @entity74 camera that had been set up on the @entity75			0
once rangers examined the footage from the missing camera they discovered that a juvenile sea eagle had picked up the camera , flown for around 20 seconds , pictured , before landing and pecking the screen at the end of the minute - long footage , the bird is showing placing the camera on the rocks on the river bed before inquisitively examining the screen with his beak , pictured @entity33 set up the camera trap on the banks of @entity5 's @entity4 's @entity3 , pictured , in @entity5 to capture footage of saltwater crocodiles one shot record the inside of the penguins beak as it reached for the camera			1
other conservationists recently strapped cameras to the back of gannets off the coast of @entity105 to learn more about what they get up to 300 miles at sea			2
the gannet cam discovered that the sea birds circle at 30 metres high before diving for fish at speeds of up to 60mph			0
watching the footage revealed male gannets tended to feed more at trawlers than females , too			2
dr @entity117 said this difference may have conservation implications when a ban on discarding is implemented under reforms to the @entity123			0
