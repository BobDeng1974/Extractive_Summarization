by @entity0 published : 12:57 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 26 june 2013 the number of people living in @entity3 and @entity4 rose by nearly 400,000 in a year despite curbs on migrants , according to official estimates			1
they show population growth has not slowed down after the years of large - scale immigration			2
one reason is a high birth rate among recent immigrants , the @entity12 analysis says			1
the number of people living in @entity3 and @entity4 grew by almost 400,000 thanks to continuing high immigration and the highest birth - rate for 40 years the latest figures , for the 12 months to the end of june last year , mean the population of @entity3 and @entity4 has grown by 3.97million , or 7.5 per cent , over the past decade of high immigration and rising birth rates			1
in the latest 12 - month period , the @entity24 ’s second year in office , ‘ growth is about average to that seen over each of the last ten years ’ – but was still the highest in @entity30			2
estimates for the whole @entity32 have not yet been published but figures suggest the total must be close to 64million – and is likely to reach 70million in around 16 years if the growth continues			0
at that point , many analysts believe overcrowding will put unbearable pressure on housing , transport , water , power and services such as health and education			0
more than 250,000 @entity47 left the capital city , possibly because of the high cost of living the @entity3 and @entity4 population grew by 396,900 thanks to a high birth rate and migration annual population growth first hit 400,000 in 2005 after the borders were opened to @entity56 and other @entity58 citizens in 2004			1
since then , net migration – the number by which the population grows after both immigration and emigration have been counted – has often been 200,000 a year or more			1
immigration curbs introduced by home secretary @entity66 may mean net migration fell to 155,500 in the year to june 2012			1
however , total numbers rose steeply because there were 239,100 more births than deaths – more than double the level in 2003			0
the @entity12 said : ‘ the number of births was at a 40 - year high – the largest since 1972			1
’ people are flooding south from northern cities , the @entity12 said			0
urban populations in the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and the @entity81 fell , while more than 24,000 extra people moved into the @entity83			0
the @entity84 showed a gain of nearly 20,000 , mainly because of retirees moving to @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
some 52,000 people left @entity92 , largely young families moving to commuter towns for cheap housing and better schools			0
the @entity12 said : ‘ the general trend is for more people to arrive than leave for regions in the south and east , whereas for the more northern regions , the net flows show more people are leaving than arriving			1
’ recent migrants tend to have high birth rates , with many of the right age to have children			0
sir @entity110 of think tank @entity109 said : ‘ this is yet more evidence of the impact of mass immigration			0
' we have the largest number of births for 40 years and the greatest addition to our population among @entity58 countries			2
‘ the dual effect of immigration and extra births accounts for about two - thirds of our population growth			0
’ a quarter of the increase came in @entity92 , where birth rates were high and where many immigrants settle			2
the increase of 396,900 people in @entity3 and @entity4 was the highest in @entity30 , followed by @entity131 at 319,100 and @entity132 with 166,200 .			1

net migration in @entity3 and @entity4 was 155,000 , says @entity12
birth - rate between june 2011 and 2012 highest for 40 years
figures show more than 250,000 ' internal migrants ' fled @entity92
