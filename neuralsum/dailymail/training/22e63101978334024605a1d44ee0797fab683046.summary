professor dame @entity0 , who said workers with depression or anxiety should be fast - tracked for @entity5 treatment workers with depression or anxiety should be fast - tracked for @entity5 treatment ahead of pensioners and the unemployed with the same conditions , according to the chief medical officer			1
professor dame @entity0 said the working days lost when men and women are off sick with mental health issues cost the economy £ 100 billion a year			1
she also urged employers to make it easier for staff who have been on long - term sick leave to come back to work by starting them off on reduced hours			1
around 70 million working days are lost because of stress , anxiety and other mental health conditions each year , a rise of a quarter since 2009			1
but campaigners warned that her proposals risked discriminating against pensioners , stay - at - home mothers and the unemployed			1
they claimed that it would undermine one of the founding principles of the @entity5 , which is that it ‘ provides a comprehensive service available to all ’ , promoting equality by focusing on patients ’ clinical need rather than their personal circumstances			0
in a report published today , @entity38 called on the @entity40 , the @entity5 watchdog , to weigh up the costs of allowing workers with depression or anxiety to be fast - tracked for treatment			2
‘ the costs of mental illness to the economy are astounding , ’ she said			0
‘ i urge commissioners and decision - makers to treat mental health more like physical health			1
‘ anyone with mental illness deserves good quality support at the right time			0
‘ one of the stark issues highlighted in this report is that 60 to 70 per cent of people with common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety are in work , so it is crucial that we take action to help those people stay in employment to benefit their own health as well as the economy			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity70 said it was likely that @entity40 would be in favour of such a policy			0
@entity38 did not indicate whether full - time workers should be prioritised over those who work part - time			0
but it would follow that their costs to the economy would be far higher if they were off sick			0
however , @entity80 , chief executive of the @entity81 said : ‘ whilst we recognise the benefit of good quality work to mental health we are concerned about the suggestion to focus the fast - tracking of care on people of working age who are at risk of falling out of work			1
‘ a health service that is free at the point of delivery should “ fast - track ” all and not discriminate in favour of those who are economically active			0
around 70 million working days are lost because of stress , anxiety and other mental health conditions each year , a rise of a quarter since 2009 ( file picture ) ‘ we consider that there must be an investment in establishing a suite of evidence - based solutions to mental ill health and support mental well - being , particularly targeted where there are the greatest inequalities			1
’ as many as 23 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men are suffering from depression or anxiety at any one time , according to @entity5 figures			0
it is thought the number of men with the conditions could be higher , because men can be less inclined to admit they have a problem and avoid seeing their doctor			0
professor sir @entity123 , president of the @entity124 , said : ‘ we endorse the chief medical officer ’s call for employment becoming a routine outcome indicator for mental health services – an outcome that has real world relevance and is simple to collect			2
‘ we also agree that more support is needed to keep those who are at risk of losing their jobs from joining the ranks of the long term sick			2

dame @entity0 says working days lost to mental health cost £ 100 billion
adds employers should make it easier for staff returning from long - term sick
70 million working days are lost *due* to issues such as stress and anxiety
