scientists believe they have discovered a giant fish that grew up to 52ft long - longer than a double - decker bus			1
fossils show the huge plankton - eating creature called @entity6 lived 160 million years ago but was wiped out at the same time as the dinosaurs			1
researchers from the @entity9 believe the bony fish could grow to around nine metres in 20 years but after 38 years it would reach 16.5 metres long , outgrowing today 's whale sharks			1
scientists believe they have discovered a giant fish which could grow up to 52ft long			1
fossils show the huge plankton - eating creature called @entity6 , artist 's impression pictured , lived 160 million years ago , but was wiped out by the same event that killed off dinosaurs the name @entity6 means ' @entity23 ' fish ' , after the fossil collector @entity25 , who discovered it in 1886 near @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity6 was a filter - feeder that swam the @entity31 seas for over 100 million years , from the middle jurassic until the end of the @entity35 period			1
the fossils discovered in the @entity37 were believed to be so fragmented that they were difficult to identify			2
this meant that researchers were unable to determine the fish 's lenght			2
however , by piecing these samples together , the researchers from the @entity9 have been able to tell how long the creature was by the position of its gills			0
the species was first discovered in 1886 by @entity48			0
however , it was difficult to work out the fish 's exact length because fossils were only found in small fragments			1
the researchers have now been able to piece samples together to tell how long the creature was by the position of its gills			0
the creature is thought to have weighed 21.5 tonnes - the same as two double - decker buses or three african elephants			1
the fish , which would live for around 40 years , had an enormous mouth which acted as a hoover to suck up thousands of small fish including shrimps and jellyfish			2
professor @entity65 of the @entity66 in @entity67 and the @entity9 's @entity68 said : ' @entity6 skeletons preserve poorly , often only as isolated fragments , so previous size estimates were largely historical arm - waving exercises			1
' the existence of these large suspension - feeding fish at this time is highly significant as it would seem to be clear evidence of a major change in plankton populations in the oceans of @entity80			2
' this has implications for our understanding of biological productivity in modern oceans and how that productivity has changed over time			0
' we looked at a wide range of specimens , not just the bones but also their internal growth structures - similar to the growth rings in trees - to get some idea about the ages of these animals as well as their estimated sizes			0
' researchers from the @entity9 found the fish could grow to around nine metres in 20 years , but after 38 years it would reach 16.5 metres long , outgrowing today 's whale sharks			1
the species was first discovered in 1886 by @entity25 ' one of the truly fascinating aspects of this fish as a suspension feeder is that it seems to have developed a unique mesh structure on its gills to help it extract plankton as the seawater passed through its mouth			0
' extremely delicate and rarely - preserved , it resembles the honeycomb pattern in a bee - hive			0
' it functioned like a trawler 's net to trap plankton , and obviously was very effective , given the large sizes this animal achieved			0
' this mesh structure is very different to what we see in today 's suspension - feeding fish and whales			2
it had a unique way of solving a similar problem			0
' the longest living bony fish is the @entity131 which can grow up to 17m in length ( 55ft ) .			0

the giant @entity6 fish lived 160 million years ago
fossils show it could have grown to 52ft - longer than a *swimming* pool
it would have been bigger than modern - day whale sharks and weighed the same as two double - decker buses
