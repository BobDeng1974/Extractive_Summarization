now onlookers will know exactly where a flight took off at the exact moment it travels above with the help of @entity12 ' new interactive billboards			2
the digital screens installed by the airline show a child standing up and pointing to the aircraft as it travels above the sign , and then displays the flight number along with the plane 's starting point			1
specially - designed surveillance technology allows the screens to interact with the aircraft flying overhead			0
the system tracks the plane and interrupts the digital display just as it passes over the site , revealing the image of a child pointing at the plane overhead accompanied by its flight number and destination			1
for example the screen may read : ‘ it ’s the @entity62 from @entity63 ’			0
there it is : as the plane passes over the billboard , the child follows it with his finger and the flight number comes up on the screen gone : the boy walks off screen and waits for the next flight to pass over waiting : the screen then goes back to the neutral picture as the technology anticipates more planes flying over outskirts : a girl is used on the advertising towers in @entity38 , @entity39 a weather feed will read cloud height to determine optimum visibility & weather conditions to show the ad , alongside daylight hour restrictions			1
other destinations will be accompanied by other information such as the lowest available fare or the temperature in the destination			0
the destinations can also be updated immediately depending on changing focus routes for the airline			0
@entity96 , @entity12 ’ head of @entity99 & @entity100 sales , said : ' sometimes we forget how magical flying can be			1
' the first time anyone gets on a plane is an unforgettable experience and we want to remind our customers of that feeling			0
' we ’ve all had conversations with friends and family wondering where the planes are going and dream of an amazing holiday or warm destination and this clever technology taps in to that and reminds people how accessible the world can be			0
' aim : the airline said the campaign was to started to recreate the magical experience of flying			1
