a pitch invader sprinted onto the pitch during @entity3 's friendly clash with @entity5 outfit @entity4 in @entity6 - and the rogue even tried to get involved in a set - piece routine			1
but he was fooling no - one despite having @entity11 's name emblazoned across his back			2
the invader does n't quite get a touch on the ball and can be seen having a quick chat with @entity3 striker @entity17 before being escorted off the pitch			0
nice try son : the fake @entity11 tries to get involved in the action during @entity3 's @entity4 clash trying it on : real striker @entity17 spots something is up as the interloper enjoys his 15 minutes of fame @entity11 gave the @entity27 champions the lead after only four minutes			1
but goals from @entity31 striker @entity30 and @entity32 and @entity34 defender @entity33 turned the game around			1
it 's not the first time a pitch invader has tried to get involved in the action at a sporting event			2
here 's how you do it : the invader gives @entity17 some advice before making his way off the pitch taking it in : the fake @entity11 , dressed head to toe in full @entity3 kit , takes in his new surroundings infamous prankster @entity52 flagrantly joined the team photo for @entity56 's @entity55 quarter - final with @entity57 at @entity58 in 2001			1
although other @entity56 players noticed his presence power managed to stay on for the photo			0
he also walked out to bat when @entity64 's cricket team played @entity65 the same year power has also played tennis against @entity68 at @entity69 , danced the haka for the @entity64 rugby team and beat @entity72 to the winner 's podium at @entity75			0
but @entity56 banned him for life when he reenacted a @entity78 goal against @entity79 with some pals on the @entity58 pitch in 2003 .			0

the pitch invader *rushed* onto the pitch in full kit during @entity3 's friendly with @entity4 in @entity6
@entity3 lost the game 2 - 1 as they fine - tune *preparations* for the new *season*
@entity11 gave the @entity27 champions an early lead
