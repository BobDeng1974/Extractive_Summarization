her fully frontal nude photoshoot for @entity2 has got everyone talking , much to her delight			0
but three years ago , @entity5 was a little less eager to bare all			1
during a january 2011 episode of @entity7 @entity9 , @entity5 had a meltdown at the prospect of being seen nude on the cover of @entity13			1
' i 'm so mad right now			0
she promised i would be covered with artwork			0
the whole concept was sold to me that nothing would be seen			0
' this really pisses me off … this is serious porn ! ' she added at the cover story , which was entitled @entity5 : the @entity37			1
the cover photo shows @entity5 nude , but her modesty was protected by bars			1
inside shots featured the star nearly completely covered in metallic body paint			0
i 'm never going naked again : the reality show star please do n't judge me : ' i do n’t want people to be like , " all she ’s good for is , you know , being naked , " she added @entity5 told sister @entity50 that the magazine 's artist would put ' images of architecture and buildings and stuff on top of me so you will see my body shape and the outline but not actually my boobs or anything			1
' so when showed the rather revealing snapshots , @entity5 freaked out , and was nearly hysterical when she called her mother @entity65			2
' i feel so taken advantage of , ' sobbed @entity5 , who found fame thanks to a leaked sex tape			2
' i 've definitely learned my lesson … i 'm never taking my clothes off again , even if it ’s for @entity72			0
' i do n’t want people to be like , " all she ’s good for is , you know , being naked , " she added			0
' i feel so taken advantage of ' : @entity5 was eager to move away from the sex tape leaked in 2007 reassurance : @entity65 tried to comfort @entity5 by telling her the pictures were gorgeous attempting to carve out a career as a businesswoman and tv star , @entity5 was perhaps , at that time , eager to move on from her sex tape which catapulted her to fame in 2007			2
now happily married to rapper @entity87 and having lost more than 50 lbs in baby weight , @entity5 was clearly keen to bare all , even telling her sisters during a 2013 episode of keeping up with the @entity92 : ' as soon as i pop this [ baby ] out - as soon as i get in shape - the first thing i want to do is @entity27 or some nude shoot			2
' i just wan na walk down the street fully naked			0
i 'm gon na be the sexy hot mom			0
' and it 's clear @entity5 was eager to perform her about - turn in style , appearing full - frontal in the inside pages of @entity2 , along with the striking front cover which shows her grinning at the camera while baring her ample bare booty covered in baby oil			1
another picture , in the shoot by famed photographer @entity105 showed @entity5 wearing a cocktail dress and recreating @entity105 's well - known @entity110 shot , with bubbly shooting into the air and landing into a glass , perfectly placed on her posterior			1
holding nothing back : @entity5 went fully nude in a newly released shot from her shoot for @entity2 with @entity105 ( censored by @entity117 ) and if anyone wondered if @entity5 had to be talked into posing for the naked shot , they can think again			2
in an interview published on @entity123 , @entity2 's editorial director @entity121 explained that it was all @entity5 's idea			1
' @entity5 ’s attitude was " if we ’re gon na do it , let ’s really go there , " ' he said			2
' and it was her idea to take off her clothes and show more than her butt			1
but we [ @entity2 ] did n’t say " let ’s do a cover with your butt hanging out			0
" ' she said she was willing to take her clothes off and one thing lead to another			0
' trending : @entity5 certainly lit up the internet with comical discussion of her new magazine cover , available online at @entity142			1
