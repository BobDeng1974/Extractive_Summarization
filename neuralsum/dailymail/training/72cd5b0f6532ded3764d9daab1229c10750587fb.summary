as part of the build - up to the start of @entity2 's @entity2 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity6 with the potential to light up @entity15 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity17 in a nutshell @entity19 have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since @entity22 's loan spell came to an end , and @entity24 is there to fill the void			1
the forward is strong , fast - paced , particularly good in the air , and has international and @entity30 experience , too			0
his paperwork stalled his start with @entity19 , but @entity17 took part in his first training session after securing his eagerly - anticipated work permit and looks raring to go			1
click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there 's £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week ... ready ? @entity17 would cost you just £ 8.1million for the season in @entity2 's @entity2 game going good : @entity17 tweeted that training was going well after securing his work permit in @entity15 @entity46 : @entity47 , october 10 1988 ( age 25 ) 2006 - 2007 : @entity51 ( 5 apps , 1 gl ) 2008 - 2010 : @entity52 ( 55 , 23 ) 2010 - 2011 : @entity53 ( 52 , 17 ) 2011 - 2014 : @entity54 ( 74 , 33 ) 2014 - now : @entity19 2010 - now : @entity47 ( 23 , 5 ) statistics based on league appearances			1
why should you have ideye in your @entity59 ? plenty of eyebrows were raised when @entity17 was bought by @entity19 for £ 10m , but there 's a good reason the @entity19 splashed the cash			1
most importantly , he 's a goalscorer			0
@entity17 proved it in @entity66 with @entity52 , @entity67 with @entity53 , @entity68 with @entity54 , and will now try to keep up his record in @entity15 with @entity19			1
it 's easier said than done , of course , but you can bet this talisman will get his name on the score - sheet on more than the odd occasion this year			2
@entity22 's loan spell at @entity19 saw him score 17 goals			1
@entity17 , another handful of a striker , will look to prove just as worthy			2
and do n't worry about the 25 - year - old being a slow starter , either			0
upon his move to @entity66 , @entity17 admitted he struggled with the cold weather			2
however , his two years there saw him hot enough in front of goal for @entity52 , scoring 23 in 55 league games			2
@entity89 starter : @entity24 's debut season in @entity15 looks set to be decent and the striker may be worth backing @entity52 to @entity53 - £ 4m @entity53 to @entity54 - £ 7m @entity54 to @entity19 - £ 10m the downside the @entity6 is a whole different kettle of fish to that of @entity68 , @entity67 and @entity66			1
yes , @entity24 's risen in stock over the years from his records in front of goal , but bringing that to @entity15 may be too tough of an ask			2
after all , more expensive strikers have tried - and failed - over the years ... then again , he may prove certain critics wrong and have a strong start as he has done elsewhere			0
the question is , do you feel lucky ? @entity108 required : @entity17 should hit the ground running but there is always that risk in the @entity6 click here to sign up for @entity113 and start managing your team ahead of the new @entity6 season , which begins on august 16			0
@entity117 has he dealt with being delayed ? it 's best to hear it from the frustrated man himself			0
@entity17 , speaking about his delayed work permit to the @entity125 , said : ' i 've already put what happened behind me			0
' right now , i 'm here and it 's all about working , working , working			0
i 've met the manager and met my new team - mates			0
' the rest of ( friday ) was all about recovery - some swimming and some running on the treadmill			0
' back : @entity17 has met his manager and new team - mates , and says it is all about ' working , working , working ' what 've you got to lose ? at £ 8.1m , @entity24 looks a steal			1
that 's cheaper than @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , and plenty more			0
at that price , @entity24 may be worth backing - even as your third - choice striker ! join @entity2 's @entity2 game and get picking now !			1

@entity17 joined @entity19 for £ *10million* from @entity54 in july
@entity47 striker raised eyebrows with price - *tag* but proved himself in @entity68
@entity17 scored 33 goals in 74 @entity159 games in three years
@entity19 striker could be a steal at £ 8.1m in @entity163 's @entity2
