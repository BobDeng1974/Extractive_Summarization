@entity0 almost completed a week to forget for @entity1 by injuring @entity2 in training ahead of their @entity4 game against @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity0 was part of the @entity1 defence which collapsed to concede three goals in the final 12 minutes against @entity9 on monday after leading 3 - 0 after an hour			1
and he took his haphazard approach to defending to a new extreme at @entity1 's @entity13 training complex when he clumsily floored @entity2 but luckily the @entity14 international was not hurt and recovered to see the funny side of the challenge			1
in his pre-match press conference on friday , @entity18 said it was important not to dwell on the points @entity1 have dropped in their last two games against @entity9 and @entity43 , but to look forward and aim to imporve on mistakes			1
' it has been excellent , ' he said			2
' you could see the emotion after the game and that was pretty much the same in the dressing room afterwards			1
' but we know the areas we need to improve			0
' we wo n't dwell on it			0
you ca n't think about what might or could have happened , you can only really focus on what has happened and look forward to getting better and improving			0
' happy days : manager @entity18 and his players look in good spirits at the club 's @entity13 complex @entity18 also insisted that defensively his side have not been good enough this season and highlighted that as a feature of their play he is keen to improve on in time for next season			1
he said : ' i 've watched it ( the @entity9 match ) three times since and i 'm still in shock when i see us end up drawing the game 3 - 3			1
' to have that much control and good concentration and organisation in the game , for it to slip with 12 minutes to go should n't happen			1
' if you ca n't keep your concentration long enough , you 'll lose your place			2
it 's as simple as that - you 'll lose your place in the squad			2
' we 've played in big games this season and showed real solidity defensively - but we went away to @entity88 and yes , we scored six goals , but we conceded three ; went away to @entity90 , scored five and conceded three ; palace three ; @entity91 three			0
' yes , there 's an element of quality from the opponent , but i look at and analyse the games intensely and a big part of it is concentration - organisation , concentrating on your job			0
' but our work is continual			0
we will really focus on that part of our game over the course of pre-season			2
' like i said when i came in , we had to improve our goals tally , so we went from 47 scored in a season ( 2011 - 12 ) to now 99 and whatever it finishes at this weekend - and we 'll do the same with the defence			0
' practice makes perfect : @entity113 watches as @entity114 perfects his shooting technique put through their paces : @entity113 and @entity119 look focused on the task in hand			0

@entity0 floors @entity2 with clumsy training ground tackle
@entity18 in good spirits on final training *session* before @entity5 game
@entity130 must lose to @entity131 in order for @entity1 to win league
