@entity0 was today christened wearing a delicate lace gown that is an exact replica of one worn 172 years ago by @entity3 @entity2 's first born			1
when he was welcomed into the faith by the @entity5 today , @entity0 wore an ivory gown made of delicate @entity8 lace and white satin , worn before him by every baby born to the @entity11 since 1841			1
royal babies were traditionally , until 2004 , christened wearing the intricate lace and satin gown made for @entity3 @entity2 's eldest daughter , @entity2 , princess royal in 1841 and used for generation after generation of royal infants including the @entity3 ’s father @entity19 , the @entity3 , @entity20 , @entity21 , prince @entity22 , with lady @entity23 the last royal baby to wear it in 2004			1
heritage : queen @entity2 in 1894 at the christening of her great - grandson , the future @entity28 ( 1894 - 1972 ) , with the baby 's mother @entity29 , above left , and the baby 's grandmother @entity34 , daughter of @entity2 - 53 years after the dress was first worn by @entity34 , right traditionally a family photograph with the baby in its robe is released to the media			1
crafted from layers of delicate , hand - made @entity8 lace and ivory satin , it was used for all royal christenings until 2004 when @entity3 decided the gown was past its prime and ordered an exact replica to be crafted by her personal dressmaker			1
an entire team of seamstresses set to work at @entity52 to recreate the intricate bows and high collar of the original gown , and it was first used for the christening of @entity57 , @entity58 , son of @entity59 and @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity60 , in 2008			1

the @entity67 and @entity68 have given their approval to the first ever royal christening coins created in the @entity71			1
the special coins , which have been produced by the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 , go on sale today to mark the christening of the couple 's son , @entity0			1
the design features the @entity81 from the @entity82 and two harp - playing cherubs			0
at the foot of the coin is the royal motto " @entity87 " - @entity88 and my right			2
the £ 5 coin is available in silver - because the crossing of a baby 's palm with silver is said to confer good health and prosperity to newborns - and gold - to commemorate the royal celebration			1
not only does it reinforce the family 's faith , but in the case of @entity0 , who is in direct line to the throne , it has more significance			2
as a future king , @entity0 will become protector of the @entity113 and @entity112 and therefore must be a full , confirmed member of the religion			0
such was the significance of baby @entity0 ’s christening that the duty fell to the archbishop of canterbury @entity120 - leader of the 77 - million strong @entity121 - to carry out the ceremony			2
the event is also a key gathering for those in the royal inner circle			2
mostly held in private , away from the public and the media , royal christenings are usually attended only by family , godparents and close friends - the people who will directly influence the prince as he grows up			0
@entity0 is the first future monarch in modern times not to be baptised at @entity52 , with the @entity67 and @entity68 choosing the intimate @entity135 at @entity136 instead			0
@entity21 and the @entity133 were both christened in @entity52 ’s @entity137			0
@entity3 , who was not expected to be queen when born , was christened in the @entity52 ’s private chapel in 1926			1
but @entity28 , who later abdicated , was baptised at @entity140 in @entity141 in 1894 and his brother @entity19 , who was not expected to be king , was christened at the @entity145 @entity144 close to the @entity147 estate in 1895			0
@entity0 is three months old - older than his father , grandfather and great - grandmother were when they were christened			0
@entity21 was baptised on august 4 1982 at the age of six weeks , while the @entity133 was one month and one day old at his own christening			0
the queen was just over five weeks old when she was christened			0
although there are usually official christening pictures released to the public - in this case , the @entity67 and @entity68 have chosen renowned showbiz photographer @entity160 to take the photos - the ceremony itself is a private affair			0
a notable exception to the usual privacy surrounding royal christenings is that of @entity166 in 1990			0
nine - month - old @entity166 was baptised during morning service at the church of @entity144 at @entity147 just before @entity169 in 1990			0
the christening was broadcast by loudspeaker across the royal estate at @entity147 , @entity173			2

' it was a lovely family occasion , a truly happy day , ' said the @entity187 , the @entity188 , who conducted the 50 - minute service			0
@entity3 , meanwhile , was baptised by the @entity191 archbishop of @entity192 , @entity190 , in the private chapel of @entity52 , on 29 may 1926			2
prince @entity21 was christened in the @entity137 at @entity52 on 4 august 1982 , while prince @entity22 was christened in @entity194 at @entity195 in 1984			0
royal christenings have not always been plain sailing			0
at @entity2 ’s in 1819 , there was a dispute over what she should be called			2
her mother the @entity203 had wanted to call her @entity205 , but was overruled by a cantankerous @entity206 , the future @entity208 , who dictated during the ceremony that she be called @entity2 instead in tribute to the @entity215 tsar @entity213 i. @entity216 was left distraught and broke down sobbing during the proceedings			2
the then princess @entity3 with husband @entity174 and their children @entity20 and @entity220 on her christening day in 1951 the christening of prince @entity21 took place privately in the music room of @entity52 , before the official photographers were taken ( @entity225 ) @entity3 , prince @entity20 , princess diana holding baby @entity21 , prince @entity174 and the @entity226 a doe - eyed prince @entity22 in 1984 before his christening the @entity67 and @entity228 leaving the @entity135 with princess @entity229 after her christening the royal family leave princess @entity166 's christening , which took place on the @entity147 estate in 1990 , and was one of the few to be shared with the local public around the estate @entity59 and @entity239 of @entity240 hold their daughter , @entity23 , in 2003 @entity57 , @entity58 , was the first royal to wear the replica gown commissioned by @entity3 to replace the 172 - year - old one made for @entity3 @entity2 's eldest daughter in 1841 @entity3 and the @entity174 with sons @entity245 , right , prince @entity20 , centre back , @entity59 and daughter @entity220 in the garden at @entity248 , @entity249 @entity3 in 1929 ( left ) prince @entity174 as a toddler in 1922 ( right ) prince @entity20 in 1948 princess @entity220 in 1952 prince @entity245 in 1960 @entity59 in 1964 @entity251 in 1979 @entity252 in 1983 prince @entity21 in 1984 prince @entity22 in 1987 @entity229 in 1989 princess @entity166 in 1991 lady @entity23 in 2011 @entity57 , @entity58 in 2010			1
