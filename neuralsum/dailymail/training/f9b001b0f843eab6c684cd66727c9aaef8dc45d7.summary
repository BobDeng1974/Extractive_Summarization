@entity0 were occupying a space that proved uncomfortable even for a company that manufactures gutters			1
the club ’s pursuit of @entity6 , an option board members maintained they were continuing to discuss on monday night , was too lowly a place for @entity9			1
as it was for @entity11			0
sign the convicted rapist , they both warned , and their sponsorship of the struggling @entity16 outfit would be terminated			1
this , it seems , was not @entity0 ’s greatest concern given the nominal sums of money involved			1
far more worrying was the possible loss of @entity24 ’s £ 1million backing , and the fact that the company ’s owner — @entity29 ’s @entity28 no less — was being urged by a police commissioner to pull the plug on the @entity0 deal should @entity6 be given a route back into football at @entity35			1
@entity0 were considering signing convicted rapist @entity6 , pictured in @entity36 on sunday @entity29 owner @entity28 has come under pressure to withdraw his £ 1million sponsorship at @entity0 @entity0 players train on monday at their @entity41 training ground but there was no sign of @entity6 as @entity0 discovered on monday , this is what happens when you even entertain the idea of signing a footballer only recently released from prison for raping a young woman in a hotel room			1
there is the public outcry that manifests itself in the form of a petition			0
never mind that @entity0 currently attract gates of around 4,000			1
more than 28,000 people had put their names to stopping @entity6 resume his football career by monday night			1
then , of course , there are the politicians			0
@entity63 and @entity64 have already endured such a response , and it was now @entity0 ’s turn			1
there was a protest not just from local mp @entity70 but @entity72 leader @entity71 and shadow sports minister @entity73			0
@entity73 called for the @entity74 to intervene and reject @entity6 ’s registration as a player			1
‘ there are many professions that people can not return to after committing this sort of crime and football must be one of them , ’ he said			2
like much of the country , @entity6 thought he was going back to work			2
after talks over the weekend he believed a club that could seriously use a striker of his ability — not least after a disastrous december that included a 7 - 0 thrashing by @entity93 — was prepared to take him on			0
board members , owner and chairman @entity96 among them , appeared prepared for the inevitable backlash in the belief that the pros — a striker who scored 48 goals in 113 games for @entity63 — outweighed the cons. @entity0 boss @entity104 later spoke to reporters outside @entity35 on monday a police officer stands outside @entity0 's training ground on monday morning so for the first time in nearly three years , @entity6 thought he was going to be training with a squad of professional footballers again			1
it would not have been the most glamorous of returns for a player who made 16 league appearances for @entity115 and has represented @entity116 13 times			0
not when a lack of facilities means the squad and staff change and shower at @entity35 and make the three - mile journey to and from the training ground in a convoy that includes a kit van			0
but professional football it remains , and on sunday @entity6 was led to believe he was finally emerging from the wilderness			1
albeit on a relatively modest £ 400 a week that some were suggesting was being covered by his fiancee ’s millionaire father , who is also funding the legal fight to clear his name			0
for @entity104 , at 33 the youngest manager in the @entity137 , it seemed a most unwelcome distraction			0
he handled himself well , facing the media when his employers and the club ’s own media officer hid inside @entity35			0
@entity0 chief executive @entity143 reads out a club statement outside @entity35 on monday afternoon at one stage @entity104 even emerged in the icy cold with some biscuits and then organised teas and coffees , apologising for the delay in issuing an official club statement			2
thanks to @entity104 , monday was not a complete pr disaster for a club that also once found a place for @entity156 , who served half of a six - year prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving			0
@entity104 , it is believed , was against bringing in @entity6 in the first place even if he did tell the media that he would ultimately support the board ’s decision			2
whatever the outcome of this sorry saga , his stock has certainly risen			0
when @entity143 , @entity0 ’s chief executive , finally emerged from his @entity35 office at 4.30 afternoon , it was to deliver a holding statement			2
‘ we continue to have conversations , ’ it read , before asking that the privacy of ‘ stakeholders and partners ’ be respected			0
@entity6 pictured in action for @entity63 on march 28 , 2012 @entity6 pictured during a @entity16 match between @entity63 and @entity181 in 2012 clearly , they still want 26 - year - old @entity6 and clearly they did n’t appreciate being pushed around			1
it seems they also did n’t appreciate @entity187 ’s apparent reluctance to attend a press conference as the chief executive of the @entity190			0
the @entity190 only represent their members but @entity0 rather hoped @entity187 would share the burden of responsibility at any possible unveiling			2
by monday night , however , the far bigger issue concerned the intervention of @entity197 and crime commissioner @entity198			0
responding to reports that @entity28 would not object to @entity0 ’s recruitment of @entity6 , @entity198 wrote to the billionaire owner of @entity29 in the strongest possible terms by urging him to ‘ withdraw sports direct sponsorship at the club ’			1
if @entity28 bows to the pressure , @entity6 will once again find himself searching for an employer .			2

@entity6 has been linked with a move to @entity16 outfit @entity0
@entity0 risk losing £ 1m @entity24 deal if they are to sign @entity6
more than 28,000 people have put their names to stopping @entity6 resume his football career
