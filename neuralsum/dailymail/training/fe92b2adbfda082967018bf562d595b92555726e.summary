by @entity0 a bridge collapse that sent cars and drivers plunging into the @entity5 in @entity6 was caused by an over-sized truck that collided with the span of structure , authorities have said			1
' for reasons unknown at this point in time the semi struck the overhead of the bridge causing the collapse , ' state patrol chief @entity10 revealed at an overnight news conference			2
the truck made it off the bridge and the driver remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators , he added			2
three passengers were pulled alive from their vehicles after they plunged tens of feet into the water below at around 7pm on thursday			1
even more were pulled from the debris , but rescuers said no one died in the dramatic accident and all victims have been accounted for			1
the @entity61 runs through the state , crossing the @entity5 at a number of different points , but the bridge where the collapse happened was between @entity67 and @entity68			1
both the north and southbound lanes of the bridge fell into the water , and as such both directions of the highway have been closed in the area			1
there were early eyewitness reports that people watching were screaming that a man was stuck inside his truck that fell in the water during the collapse			2
damage : the first pictures of the scene show that both the north and southbound lanes of the @entity61 highway collapsed on thursday evening just before 7pm rescue : three people were initially pulled from the water alive , though there remained concerns about other possible passengers who were trapped by debris collapse : the section of the interstate 5 bridge over the @entity5 is seen in an aerial view @entity98 , a volunteer firefighter , said he was driving in the area when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye			1
' the bridge just went down , it crashed through the water , ' he said			0
' it was really surreal			0
' at least two vehicles - a car and the pickup with a trailer attached - fell into the river , officials said			2
vehicles in the water , which is about 15 ft deep at the point of the incident , could be seen bobbing on the surface and were likely resting on collapsed portions of the bridge			1
@entity121 and his wife were in their pickup truck on @entity61 heading to a camping trip when a bridge before them disappeared in a ' big puff of dust ' , he said			1
' i hit the brakes and we went off , ' @entity121 said from hospital , adding he ' saw the water approaching ... you hold on as tight as you can			0
' desperate search : eyewitnesses said that they could hear a man screaming from one of the trucks that fell in the water troubled water : both the north and south bound lanes of the interstate were effected so much of the nearby highway was closed in order to prevent any other accidents scary : though the water was not particularly deep where the collapse occurred , there were a number of other factors that could prove threatening for the passengers inside the cars , like this overturned one questions : there are unconfirmed reports that a large truck hit something to unsteady the bridge but investigators are still looking into what caused the unexpected collapse @entity121 , who was dumped into the chilly waters with his wife and another man in a different vehicle , dislocated his shoulder in the plunge			1
he managed to pop it back in to place before calling out to his wife , who he described as being in shock			0
the three victims were taken to @entity177 with non-life - threatening injuries			0
the other man was reported in stable condition at @entity184 in @entity185 , hospital ceo @entity180 said			0
officials were quick to note that it would not be a massive accident , as highway trooper @entity189 told local station @entity190 that because the bridge is in a relatively rural area , he does not expect mass casualties			2
the bridge , which was built in 1955 , was inspected twice last year and repairs were made , transportation secretary @entity194 said			0
' it 's an older bridge that needs a lot of work just like a good number of bridges around the state , ' she said			0
hopeful : crowds gathered on the river bank as the rescue crews bring survivors out of the water viewing the scene : crowds gathered on the top of the bridge as they tried to assess the damage location : the bridge itself is in a rather remote area between the towns of @entity67 and @entity68 but the interstate itself is a major thoroughfare that connects @entity222 to @entity223 officials are now working on plans for either a temporary or permanent replacement , she said			1
according to a blog that monitors transportation reports , the 2010 inspection called for an estimated $ 1,035,000 in repairs to bring the bridge and its connection to the surrounding riverbank up to satisfactory levels			0
the bridge was not classified as structurally deficient , but the @entity237 listed it as being ' functionally obsolete ' - meaning the design is outdated , such as having low clearance			0
the bridge has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100 , according to federal records , which is well below the statewide average rating of 80 , according to an @entity245 analysis .			0
