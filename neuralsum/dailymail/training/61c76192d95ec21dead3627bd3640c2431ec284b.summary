while @entity63 may be best - known for its successful business leaders such as @entity64 , chairman of @entity94 conglomerate @entity93 , it also boasts political graduates such as minister and @entity97 mp for @entity98			0
the only other institution to boast more than 100 mega-rich alumni is the @entity101			0
however , on a global scale the @entity103 universities are the only @entity26 institutions to make the cut , with 17 of the top 20 wealth creators being from the @entity107 despite the reputation of @entity6 and @entity8 as bastions of the aristocratic elite , relatively few of their multi-millionaires inherited their wealth			1
more than two thirds of @entity103 alumni worth more than £ 20million made their fortunes through their own efforts with no help from their families			0
at the @entity121 , by contrast , fewer than half made their millions thanks to an entrepreneurial spirit , with the majority relying on an inheritance to build their own fortune			0
the @entity128 is where the most self - made millionaires can be found - 84 per cent of its super-rich graduates became wealthy on their own			2
entrepreneurial : 84 per cent of the 68 super-rich from the @entity128 , pictured , made their money themselves without inheriting from their families contrast : at the @entity121 , fewer than half the 80 multi-millionaire alumni made their money without help from their families @entity6 : wealthy alumni of the university include financier @entity47 , who is worth £ 700million , and entrepreneur @entity48 , believed to have a £ 300million fortune ; both of them studied history 1 ) @entity144 - 2,964 alumni worth a total of $ 622bn 2 ) @entity147 - 1,502 alumni worth $ 242bn 3 ) @entity149 - 1,174 alumni worth $ 171bn 4 ) @entity151 - 889 alumni worth $ 116bn 5 ) @entity153 - 828 alumni worth $ 110bn 6 ) @entity155 - 658 alumni worth $ 144bn 7 ) @entity157 - 581 alumni worth $ 172bn 8 ) @entity159 - 568 alumni worth $ 125bn 9 ) @entity161 - 528 alumni worth $ 60bn 10 ) @entity163 - 508 alumni worth $ 70bn 11 ) @entity165 - 499 alumni worth $ 31bn 12 ) @entity167 - 291 alumni worth $ 38bn 13 ) @entity169 - 451 alumni worth $ 36bn 14 ) @entity171 - 447 alumni worth $ 72bn 15 ) @entity173 - 410 alumni worth $ 70bn 16 ) @entity6 - 401 alumni worth $ 51bn 17 ) @entity176 - 374 alumni worth $ 66bn 18 ) @entity178 - 372 alumni worth $ 37bn 19 ) @entity8 - 361 alumni worth $ 93bn 20 ) @entity181 - 349 alumni worth $ 23bn previous research has suggested that the most lucrative subjects to study are medicine , law and engineering , which all give their students a significant earnings boost over the course of their careers			1
the least well - paying degrees are the arts and humanities - but that did not stop history graduates like mr @entity37 and @entity197 from becoming extremely wealthy			0
the overwhelming majority of ' ultra-high - net - worth individuals ' from @entity26 universities are male , with just one in 11 of them being women			0
for @entity6 graduates , the situation is even more one - sided - 94 per cent of its super-wealthy alumni are men			2
@entity8 : actor @entity37 , a former history student , and beer mogul @entity35 , who studied law have both amassed large fortunes - nearly £ 70million and as much as £ 80million respectively number three : the @entity57 has 273 super-rich alumni including singer @entity58 , who took courses in business at the university number four : among the 127 multi-millionaires produced by @entity62 are @entity61 's @entity60 , a noted scientist with a phd in astrophysics while higher education in the @entity26 clearly deserves some of the credit for the success of its alumni , the average super-rich graduate is well out of university at the age of 57			1
@entity227 of @entity228 said the findings showed that future business leaders were still attracted to @entity26 universities			0
' 17 out of the 24 @entity234 universities are featured in the report , which reflects the ability of such prestigious institutions to attract high - calibre individuals , who proceed to create financial success , ' he said			0
despite the strong showing of many @entity26 institutions , the @entity107 dominates the global rich list - @entity144 , in top spot , has almost 3,000 graduates worth more than £ 20million , nearly twice as many as second - placed @entity147			1
@entity6 stands at number 16 in the international list , with @entity8 at number 19			2
the majority of institutions on the global version of the list are private universities in the @entity107 , including @entity254 colleges such as @entity151 , @entity159 , @entity161 , @entity163 and @entity181			2
the only @entity107 public universities with more than 350 super-rich alumni are the @entity165 , the @entity171 , @entity257 and the @entity173			2
the one entry on the list from outside the @entity107 and the @entity26 may be surprising - it is the @entity178 , which despite being located in a @entity261 country has 372 alumni worth more than £ 20million			0
the university has long been popular with the children of @entity94 's wealthy elite , and its former students include billionaire industrialist @entity267 and legendary former cricketer @entity268 .			0
