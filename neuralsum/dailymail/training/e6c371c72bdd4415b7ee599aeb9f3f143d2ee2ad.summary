an @entity1 teacher is under fire for bringing her infant baby to class and even breastfeeding it while students study			1
the unnamed teacher in @entity9 , population 290 , has been bringing the baby to her rural high school on and off for weeks , students say			1
and while some tolerate the baby 's presence , others say its crying -- not to mention its frequent and unmistakable need to feed -- have become a nuisance			1
' especially since we have a bunch of teenage boys in there			0
' the teacher started bringing the baby to work on and off after she returned from maternity leave to the school of around 250 students			1
one of the students snapped a photo of the teacher breastfeeding the baby under a blanket and posted it to @entity48			2
a student also recorded video of the classroom , in which she says the cries of a baby can be heard , reports @entity34			0
the student said the baby is a constant disruption to the class			2
appalling ? some students at tiny @entity59 are appalled , but others say the baby -- and its feeding habits -- is not a distraction word spreads : poyen in rural @entity1 has a population of just 290 but others disagree			2
one student who did give his name says the baby may as well not even be there			0
' the baby just lays back there and plays with its toys , every now and then it may cry , but she goes back there and takes care of it , ' said @entity81			0
another student , @entity82 , agreed and told @entity34 : ' i mean it 's a cute baby and i do n't think it 's a distraction at all			0
' the school principal told @entity34 that teachers are permitted to bring their children to class only in emergency situations			1
he declined further comment , calling the situation a ' personnel issue			0

the unnamed @entity96 , @entity1 teacher has been bringing her baby to class and feeding it as students study
some are fine with it and with the baby 's presence , but others have *lodged* *complaints*
the school 's principal will only say that teachers may bring their children to class in emergency situations
