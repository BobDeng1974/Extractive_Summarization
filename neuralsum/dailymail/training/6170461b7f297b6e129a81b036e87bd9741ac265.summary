@entity0 , 19 , was cleared by a judge at @entity2 of running a cannabis factory despite ‘ probably being involved ’			1
he had originally tried running away when found hiding at the property by police and spent six months in custody before his case went to trial			2
fearing he would flee the authorities and ‘ evaporate into the black economy ’ after his release , judge @entity20 , @entity21 , asked that the @entity22 be alerted so that officials could detain him			1
police were also made aware of the situation and the judge ’s fears @entity0 may disappear again			1
but two hours after his trial collapsed @entity0 was released by security guards at @entity2 because no one had come to collect him and there were no warrants against his name			1
the @entity5 teenager had been given £ 50 to catch a train and was expected to travel 100 miles to @entity37 to hand himself in to be processed by the @entity22			1
the incident happened on tuesday and yesterday there was no word as to whether @entity0 followed orders or vanished into the night as the judge feared he would			1
@entity0 was charged with production of cannabis between january and may this year after he was arrested at a house in @entity46 , @entity47 , containing £ 24,000 of the drug			1
police found his finger prints on two cups and a can of drink at the property and the prosecution claimed his job was to fertilise the plants and control their lighting			0
after prosecutor @entity60 outlined the @entity62 ’s case the judge ordered the jury to return a not guilty verdict due to insufficient evidence			2
judge @entity20 told the jury the fingerprint evidence did not prove he was involved in the drug production as ‘ mere presence at the scene was not enough ’ to prove guilt			2
he said the defendant ’s claim to have been at the house one night seemed like ‘ a tall story ’ and ‘ has a nasty smell			0
’ he told the jury : ‘ you may have reached the view , as i have , that he was probably involved			0
it is highly questionable what he did			0
but probable is not a crime			0
’ the judge continued : ‘ he will have to be reported to the @entity22			1
i am going to release him very shortly indeed			0
i would like the @entity22 to know of this immediately , otherwise i think he will evaporate into what is described as the black economy			2
’ judge @entity20 then told the defendant : ‘ you are an illegal immigrant			1
you should not be in the @entity91			0
i have no idea how you got here			0
' that is for the @entity22 to sort out			2
i think it highly likely that you will be deport and not allowed back in the @entity91 or any other @entity97 state			0
for you it is a pyrrhic victory as you will be sent back to @entity5			0
’ two hours after his trial collapsed @entity0 was released by security guards at @entity2 ( pictured ) because no one had come to collect him and there were no warrants against his name @entity0 was crying in the dock but stopped when his interpreter told him he had been cleared			1
the defendant then held his hands as if in prayer			0
the judge told him he had received papers to go to @entity37 and could make an application for asylum at that point			1
the police officer in the case was at @entity2 and told of the judge ’s request to alert the @entity22			1

a source from the @entity132 security company said : ‘ this is not the first time			0
