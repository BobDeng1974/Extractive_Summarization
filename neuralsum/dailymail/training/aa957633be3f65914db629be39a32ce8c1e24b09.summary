by @entity0 at @entity5 's campus in @entity6 , south of the @entity7 , images of @entity2 and @entity3 decorate the walls			1
for now , at least , they serve as a reminder that success in football does not always have to be measured in league titles			0
when @entity15 's @entity3 secured his second @entity16 earlier this year , it was the third time since 2000 that the @entity17 had been a graduate of the @entity21 club 's fabled academy			0
of all of @entity25 's talent factories , only @entity23 's famed @entity22 can beat @entity5 's record			1
yet while the senior side have not won a @entity30 title since 2002 , there was progress last season at the @entity33 , @entity5 's impressive , modern 50,000 - capacity stadium			1
a second - place finish in the league represented a fair improvement on seventh the previous season			0
scroll down to see @entity40 's man of the match display for @entity41 done deal : @entity5 and @entity41 have reached an agreement on player @entity40 costly : @entity40 has a £ 48m release clause in his @entity5 contract promise : @entity5 signed talented teenager @entity40 from @entity41 on a six - year contract @entity49 inspiring @entity41 assisting all four goals but at a club that so values its own production line , further optimism was to be found in the rise of the new generation of @entity57 academy graduates , continuing the trend set by illustrious predecessors such as @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
last season , @entity64 , 22 , was @entity67 's @entity66 and @entity68 are currently pondering a £ 37.5million move			1
@entity70 is merely the latest electric winger in green and white to roll off the @entity5 conveyor belt			1
another 20 - year - old , the versatile @entity72 , may be @entity74 but he has been attached to @entity5 since the age of nine and wore the name @entity77 , rather than @entity72 , on his back in a nod to his @entity81 surroundings			1
@entity72 captained each of @entity5 's age - group xis before breaking through , at 19 , into the senior side and became a stand - out			1
esteemed company then , for young @entity40 , following his stunning £ 3million move from @entity41 that was finally announced on the @entity90 club 's website at 5.30am on tuesday			1
according to former @entity93 attacker @entity92 , there could be no better place for the 18 - year - old from @entity96 to turn his huge potential into stardom than at a club whose faith in youth has rendered them @entity67 's fame academy			1
pretender to the throne : @entity40 has been nicknamed ' @entity106 ' due to similarities in playing style next in line : @entity40 will hope to follow in the footsteps of @entity3 at @entity5 as a highly - rated @entity67 under - 21 player in his early days , @entity60 starred alongside kids with big futures like @entity114 , later of @entity115 and @entity116 , and former @entity117 and @entity119 star @entity118			1
and from 34 - year - old @entity60 's local knowledge , the former @entity121 attacker expects @entity40 - who was scouted by @entity124 , the talent spotter who found @entity3 - to be stuck straight in centre stage from the very minute the new @entity21 season kicks off			1
' just like anywhere , money is tight in @entity21 and it 's very rare for a team to spend £ 3million on a teenager , ' former @entity126 striker @entity60 told @entity131			1
' @entity5 would simply not do that then stick him in their feeder team			2
they will have done their homework thoroughly on @entity40 and i think you 'll see him at @entity136 next season			2
@entity5 will play a 4 - 3 - 3 with @entity40 just off the striker and i think he will flourish there because , from what i 've seen , it 's his best position			1
' it 's a terrific move for @entity40 because , at @entity143 and @entity115 , the pressure would be huge			1
they are massive clubs that win a lot but @entity5 have n't won the title for a long time and while they are a huge club , too , expectations are higher elsewhere			2
' not so long ago @entity5 had financial problems but they changed their president and last season they did very well , finishing second to reach the @entity152			2
their last manager , @entity153 , left for @entity154 at the end of the season and they 've brought in a young @entity21 coach , @entity157 , who is 36			0
' @entity5 will be looking to improve next season - and they will see @entity40 as a key part of that			1
he will have a lot of the ball and the time to create			0
apart from against the big two , teams will largely be defending against @entity5			2
' it 's also the perfect club because of the way they develop their young players , both home - grown and bought in			0
@entity5 are renowned as having the best academy in the country , one of the finest in @entity25			2
' they have a good name after developing players like @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity63			0
but the development does not stop after the youth team			0
it continues right up until they sell players			0
' that brings @entity60 on to the staggering £ 48m release clause in @entity40 's contract with @entity5 , which could see @entity41 quadruple their £ 3m transfer fee			1
' that 's a common practice in @entity67 , to protect your investment , ' said @entity60			2
' if you look at @entity186 ( @entity188 's @entity187 star striker ) , he was brought from @entity189 by @entity115 and sold for £ 35m ( to @entity154 ) , and @entity190 of @entity191 was brought in ( by @entity143 ) and sold for a similar big fee to @entity193			0
' but for each of those success stories , there are players who come in with a clause and then leave for far less , or drop out of the game			0
i suspect @entity5 will have a four - year plan for @entity40 to improve him then sell him on for a big profit			1
' i do n't think @entity40 will be the last big export out of @entity205			1
i work as a coach in the @entity208 under - 14 academy and i am seeing a huge difference in the quality of local players to when i first arrived in @entity205 10 years ago			1
' as a result of clubs having less money , young local players are getting more of a chance and it 's definitely for the good of the @entity205 game			2
@entity40 's move will also benefit @entity205 football because nobody in @entity67 knows a lot about @entity205 football			1
but £ 3m for a @entity205 teenager will make everyone sit up and notice			1
' it will be hard for @entity40 , adjusting to the culture and the language , and when the league kicks off next month it will be roasting hot			2
but i think @entity40 will succeed because he 's got the skill and , it seems , the temperament , too			2
he 's a terrific player , very technical			0
' the last @entity234 to sign for a @entity21 club was @entity236 when he left @entity237 for @entity238 in 2004			0
the @entity239 , who had spells at @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 but is now retired , last night warned @entity40 to expect a culture shock			2
but the 33 - year - old also believes @entity40 's first taste of the @entity5 v @entity248 will remind him of @entity205			1
' when any of the big three - @entity143 , @entity5 and @entity115 - meet each other , everything grinds to a halt , ' @entity236 told @entity131			1
' but the biggest game in the country is @entity143 against @entity5 because they are both from @entity254			2
it is similar to the @entity256 v @entity258 rivalry			0
it 's fiercely passionate and there are three daily newspapers devoted solely to football			0
' it 's going to be very different to what @entity40 is used to			2
he will find the training more intense but the lifestyle more laid back			0
there 's never a rush to do anything			0
' i remember when i moved over to @entity238 we were doing morning sessions and going for a sleep and then doing afternoon sessions			0
' i thought it was just pre-season training because back home i was used to training in the mornings			0
but then it continued through the season and i was like , " what 's going on here ? " ' but i learned a lot as a footballer			0
the game over there is more relaxed , more counter-attack focused			0
it should improve @entity40 's all - round game			1
' i did n't get the chance to play at the @entity33 but i did play against @entity5 at home			2
they 've a great reputation for producing young players - but also for giving young players a chance in their first team			0
' my advice to @entity40 would be to enjoy the challenge and the opportunity but also try to learn the language			0
it 's something i wish i had put more time into when i was in @entity21			0
' i found the whole experience a change in culture but i loved my time there			0
sadly , at the end of the season we were relegated and @entity242 came in for me			0
i would have stayed out in @entity21 but i did n't fancy playing in the second tier there			0
' i hope @entity40 does well at @entity5 and i wish him all the best on his adventures			1
