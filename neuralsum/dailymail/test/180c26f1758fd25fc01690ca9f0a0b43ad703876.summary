mr @entity0 will hand @entity1 mps the unprecedented power to set a higher state pension and more generous dole and disability payments in a desperate attempt to reverse the exodus of his voters to the @entity16			1
he will unveil the radical proposals in his manifesto , due to be published tomorrow , as he attempts to fight back in @entity1 – a key @entity20 battleground			1
