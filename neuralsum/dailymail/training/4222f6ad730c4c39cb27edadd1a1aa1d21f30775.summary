think of a @entity1 hand axe and you may imagine a simple teardrop shape hewn from flint			0
but archaeologists in @entity6 have uncovered a rare 5,500 - year old axe complete with its wooden handle			1
the @entity10 tool was revealed during a dig to prepare for a tunnel and may have been rammed into the ground as some sort of ritual offering			1
the @entity10 tool was revealed during a dig to prepare for a tunnel and may have been rammed into the ground as some sort of ritual offering the flint axe ’s wooden handle was preserved because the tool was shoved into the clay seabed , where oxygen could not reach it , according to archaeologists at the @entity30			1
the team uncovered the tool in @entity32 on the @entity6 island of @entity34 , which will be connected to the @entity36 island of @entity37 when the tunnel is built			1
‘ finding a hilt axe that is so well preserved is absolutely incredible , ’ said @entity39 , archaeologist at the museum			2
the team uncovered the tool in @entity32 on the @entity6 island of @entity34 along with other wooden tools , while they were excavating the site of the @entity46 ( marked )			1
the island will be connected to the @entity36 island of @entity37 when the tunnel is built a flint halberd was found less than one metre from the axe , also placed vertically in the mud , suggesting it too was a ritual offering archaeologists working on excavations of the @entity46 in @entity34 found evidence of at least two people 's footprints , dating back to the @entity1			1
the experts believe they were left by fishermen attempting to protect nearby river barriers during poor weather			0
' it is quite surreal to have found human footprints , ' said archaeologist @entity64			0
' we normally find historical clues in the form of human waste , but here we have found an entirely different clue and a first in @entity6 archaeology : a physical print left behind by a human			2
' ' we know about animal footprints being found from the past , but human footprints have , as far as i know , never been found in @entity6 @entity1 archaeology			2
' the footprints were found running along a 3.2ft - long ( one metre ) system of fishing weirs used to feed a nearby @entity1 community			2
their close proximity to these barriers , as well as their depth and position , suggest that a storm caused the barriers to flood and become covered in sand			0
using the size of the prints as a guide , experts from @entity90 believe that the poor weather threatened the barriers , and the fishermen would have waded into the water to try to protect them			0
as each print was made , sand was pushed into the seabed and became preserved over time			2
‘ because of the unique preservation conditions , we have found much organic matter in the course of the excavations , including a large number of … candlesticks			2
@entity111 told @entity112 : ' two wooden paddles , also placed verticalyl in the seabed , eight wooden spears and six axe handles without the axes , are some of the many spectacular finds we discovered			1
' in the same area we have found depositions of ceramic and animal bones , in one concentration we found about 60 jaws from different animals , together with two antler axes made from red deer antler , both with small pieces of the wooden handles preserved in the shaft holes			1
dr @entity39 said that then the team saw most of the axe stuck 12 inches ( 30cm ) into the ground , they knew they had ‘ a unique find ’			0
@entity1 people living in the area used such axes for working wood and they played a role in converting @entity137 into an agricultural region , because dense forests had to be cleared to make way for fields in which to grow crops or let animals graze			0
but the experts believe the axe played a role in religious life at the time too			0
with the introduction of agriculture , societies became more hierarchical and religion became more important too			0
the archaeologists say that the communities of south @entity34 may have used the coast as an offering area and nearby marshes and wetlands show signs of burial customs and rituals , in the forms of large stone graves			1
‘ the vertical objects found in the excavations east of @entity32 , clearly shows that people have used the coast [ as a ] sacrifice area , ’ they said			0
the experts believe that objects such as the axe were ‘ deliberately ’ stabbed in underground clay as part of a ritual			1
dr @entity39 explained : ' the interpretation as a ritual find is mainly based on the fact that many of the artefacts are placed vertically in the ground , which is not the normal way for artefacts in an archaeological context			0
' it tells us that the axe and other artefacts are placed on purpose in the shallow water just off the coast and there are no obvious functional or profane explanation for this			0
that ’s why we see it as ritual depositions			0
so far , the excavations have also revealed uncovered 5,000 - year - old footprints and archaeologists hope to discover more interesting offerings buried in the clay			1

so far , the excavations have also revealed 5,000 - year - old footprints ( pictured ) that are thought to have been made by fishermen trying to safeguard weirs during a storm that hit the region and caused flooding			1

@entity10 tool was revealed during a dig to prepare for a tunnel
@entity216 was preserved because the 5,500 - year - old axe was buried in a clay seabed where oxygen could *n't* reach it for thousands of years
archaeologists at the @entity30 , @entity6 , believe the tool was jammed into the ground as part of a ritual offering
they found it on the island of @entity34 at the site of what will be a tunnel
candlesticks , a paddle , wooden bows and other axes have been found
