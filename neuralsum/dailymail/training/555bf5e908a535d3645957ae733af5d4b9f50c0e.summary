@entity0 is standing , shivering and bobble - hatted , outside a changing - room he has just shared with a team of teenagers at a ground which barely holds 500 spectators			1
the @entity8 air is biting cold and rain spits through the steel staircase which doubles as shelter from these coarse climes			2
@entity0 , though , is burning with passion and appreciation			1
it is the little things which matter most to him now			2
like waking up every morning and driving to training			2
the promise of a kickabout with his pals			0
sharing a cup of mate – @entity26 's national tea drink - with best friend @entity27			2
running naked around the corridors of @entity30 's training ground , much to the amusement of team - mates and staff			1
giving an interview as a footballer			0
@entity0 brings the ball forwad for @entity30 's under 21 side in a game against @entity39 the midfielder scored his first goal since beating testicular cancer against the @entity43 on monday night @entity0 ( hidden ) is mobbed by his team - mates after finding the back of the net at @entity47 the little things matter when you 've beaten something as big as cancer , a battle the 31 - year - old has twice fought , and twice won			1
but the prospect of one special day still excites @entity0			1
' yes , i have played in a @entity56 , but if i play again for @entity30 then that will be the best moment of my career , ' he tells @entity59 having earlier scored his first goal – a 20 - yard beauty curled into the top corner – since returning to the north - east last month to build fitness as skipper of @entity66 's under 21 side			1
' to get back after the cancer and chemotherapy , to put all of that behind me , would be a huge moment for me			2
' if i come back and play for @entity30 then for me it will be the best			1
' there have been reports that @entity0 will never play for @entity30 again because one more appearance triggers an extension to his contract , which expires in the summer			1
this , however , is not true			0
rather , it will take at least seven more games to activate that clause			0
@entity0 has not played for the @entity82 since october , 2013 , the same month he was diagnosed with testicular cancer			1
a huge screen at @entity85 shows a ' @entity30 for @entity0 ' message during @entity30 's win over @entity88 former @entity89 man @entity0 lost all of his hair after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer @entity0 made his return to action in an under 21 game against @entity97 on december 22 @entity98 midfielder @entity0 drives forward during his country 's @entity56 clash with @entity101 in 2010 he returned to @entity26 for treatment where he had a testicle removed and was given the all - clear			1
the cancer , however , returned in june of last year			1
this time , chemotherapy was necessary			0
the importance of football , he concedes , was soon relegated			0
' there was a time when all i could think about was the treatment and i had to put myself in the hands of the doctors , ' he recalls			0
' i was always positive and i told my family and friends , " listen , the most important thing is to be healthy again "			2
i did not know what was going to happen in the future at that moment			0
' all i wanted was to be healthy and come through all of my chemotherapy			0
when i was first told about the cancer i went home to my dad and cried			2
' then , it was hard to find my hair fall out			0
i did not want to cut it and i wanted to hold on			0
' fighting cancer makes the rest of the problems seem insignificant			2
' that , then , is why he now takes so much pleasure from what the majority of sportsmen – and the rest of us , for that matter – take for granted			0
' just waking up in the morning and knowing i can train after all of the treatment and chemotherapy , that is the most important , ' he says , having been discharged from hospital in early november			0
the 31 - year - old has become a favourite among fans since signing for @entity30 back in 2008 @entity0 ( left ) pulls off a sliding tackle during his first game back in the black and white stripes @entity0 discovered he had cancer after a foul by @entity154 ( right ) in may 2013 left him needing a scan @entity0 , pictured in action during his first game back , has captained @entity66 's @entity158 side ' i love to do all of this – these are the types of things i have missed			1

i enjoy this now more than ever			0
' if i remember what has happened to me then i assure you , i have enjoyed every day of training , every little thing			1
' it is a pleasure to be with my team - mates every day			2
' @entity0 has always been a favourite at @entity85			1
he arrived from @entity89 in 2008 bearing the moniker ' @entity171 ' – he once promised a young boy he met at the cinema that he would wear the superhero 's mask in celebration of his next goal and that he duly did – and later donned his disguise in front of the @entity181 following a solo strike against @entity183 in the @entity185 - winning season			1
that the @entity26 international stayed at the club following relegation from the @entity189 in 2009 cemented his standing among the @entity30			1
' i was in tears when i heard my name sung on television , ' says @entity0 , remembering the moment he watched a @entity30 match from his home in @entity198 during his recovery and broke down upon hearing the terrace tribute			1
' i say thank you to those fans			2
that has always been there with me , always			0
through all of my treatment the messages and support from the @entity30 fans was special , it made me happy			1
' to be at home in @entity26 and hear my song and then the clapping in the 18th minute ( in recognition of his squad number ) was very emotional – i do n't have the words to say what power that gave me			0
@entity0 celebrates a goal against @entity183 in 2010 by putting on a @entity171 mask at @entity85 @entity0 winks at the camera as he leads out @entity30 's under 21 side ahead of kick - off at @entity47 @entity0 has now successfully beaten cancer on two occasions after getting the all - clear in early november ' it is true that it gives you the strength to go forward			1
' @entity0 , though , is not yet ready for a return to @entity85 '			1
' it is hard for me , ' he says			0
' for now , i prefer to be at home and watch on tv			0
it 's hard to be in the changing - room at this moment			2
' instead , @entity0 wants to return as a player			1
' i have been at this club and in this city for seven years			0
the welcome from the fans from the day i arrived has been special , i have always had a special relationship with them , ' he adds			2
' but i have to get fit and be right ( before i return )			0
then we will speak about what happens next			0
' if you watch all of the games i have played in since coming back then i have been improving in every one of them			0
' now , i feel really good			0
maybe in two weeks i will be at 100 per cent			0
maybe then i can sprint past someone in a one - on - one , but that is the last part of being ready to play , that is normal			1
' i need to have that in my locker before i play , because that was always one of the most important parts on my game , playing on the wing and getting past players			1
' i want to get back to that and i feel i am now close			0
maybe now i will have to buy a new @entity171 mask ! ' mask or no mask , when he eventually does run out in front of 52,000 @entity30 he will receive a superhero 's reception			1
for @entity0 , that will be no small thing .			1
