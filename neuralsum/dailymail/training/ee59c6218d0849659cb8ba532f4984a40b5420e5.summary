the life of @entity1 will once again be brought to the screen , but this time the small screen as @entity4 has announced it will be making a miniseries about the iconic actress , starring a woman who has had a storied career herself - @entity9			1
the @entity11 winner , who took home a golden statue for her work in @entity15 , is set to star as @entity1 's mother @entity16 in the new series , appropriately titled @entity1			2
it should be a very juicy role for the actress , as @entity16 was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own life may have been even more traumatic than that of her tragic daughter			1
@entity1 of course would go on to have numerous tumultuous relationships in her lifetime , most famously with two of the men she married , baseball legend @entity50 and playwright @entity51			0
according to @entity53 , the role of @entity1 has not yet been cast			2
this news comes as rumors of yet another big screen movie about @entity1 , this one titled @entity57 , continue to swirl , with reports stating earlier this year that @entity59 would play the blonde bombshell after @entity61 dropped out of the project			0
more movies : @entity59 ( left ) is also set to play @entity1 in the film @entity64 , this after @entity61 ( right ) dropped out perfect : @entity66 ( above ) gave perhaps the most definitive portrayal of the actress in the 2011 film @entity69 , earning an @entity11 nomination for her work no doubt making the task of playing @entity1 that much more daunting is the critical praise that was heaped upon the last actress to portray her , @entity66 , who went on to earn an @entity11 nomination for her pitch perfect performance in the 2011 film @entity69			2
@entity79 @entity78 of @entity66 ' work on the film , ' she evokes so many marilyns , public and private , real and make - believe			0
we did n't know @entity1 , but we believe she must have been something like his of course an obvious choice for the role could be @entity9 's own daughter , actress @entity88			1
ideal casting ? : the role of @entity1 has yet to be cast , but @entity9 's own daughter @entity88 ( above ) would be a natural choice the two have shared the screen in films like @entity95 and @entity96 , in which they played mother and daughter , as well as @entity100 , in which they played the younger and older version of the same woman			1
the four hour miniseries , based on @entity107 's book , @entity108 of @entity1 , is set to start filming later this year			0
it will air in 2015 .			0

@entity9 will play @entity16 , the mother of @entity1 , in a new @entity4 miniseries about the actress which will air in 2015
@entity16 was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic whose own mother committed suicide and whose father died of syphilitic insanity
