@entity1 have seen a dip in form since winning the @entity4 in july and a 4 - 0 @entity6 qualifying win over @entity7 on friday was proof the players need to get their mind off the awards and start playing again , coach @entity0 said			1
the @entity12 had pledged a goal bonanza against the @entity15 minnows after losing to @entity16 and drawing with @entity17 in october			2
but they only netted three times - the fourth came from a @entity7 own goal - and whistles and jeers could be heard as the @entity4 winners walked off the pitch in @entity24			1
' now we need to get all of this out of our heads at the end of this @entity4 year , draw a line and prepare properly for our next tournament			2
' the @entity12 , second in @entity47 on seven points along with @entity49 and @entity50 with @entity16 top on 10 , were the only ones attacking with all 11 @entity7 players in or around their own box			1
' we did not hold our positions			0
true it is not always easy when you have some many people at the back			0
there was little space but that 's where we have to have a high tempo			0
' @entity1 's @entity65 ( centre ) challenges for the ball during the match against @entity7 @entity69 looks disappointed during a match that @entity1 were expected to breeze ' there you need one - on - one situations but we instead stopped and played the ball back			1
' with @entity12 media expecting a double - digit scoreline , the four - time @entity4 winners were instead lacklustre for much of the second half , running out of ideas			1
instead of stretching the game over the wings to open up @entity7 , they piled bodies through the middle in an already crowded area			2
' at times there were 18 players in that middle			0
for some players i expected a lot more , ' said @entity0			1
' a stronger drive towards goal , more finishes because our opponent did not do much else except wait at the edge of the box			0
we need to be able to solve these things better			0
' with @entity15 champions @entity101 their next opponents in a friendly on november 18 , @entity1 are eager to round off the year with a positive result against the team that had won the previous three major international trophies .			0

@entity1 beat @entity7 4 - 0 in their @entity6 qualifier on friday night
manager @entity0 was unhappy with his players ' performance
he said the @entity12 players now need to forget about the @entity4
whistles and jeers were heard as the players left the field in @entity24
