miracle babes : @entity1 risked her own life by refusing treatment for breast cancer during her pregnancy with son @entity6 it is a decision no expectant mother should have to face			1
after years of trying for a baby , @entity1 finally discovered that she was pregnant			1
but her delight turned to despair days later when doctors found she had breast cancer and advised her to sacrifice her unborn child ’s life in order to save her own by beginning chemotherapy			1
mrs @entity1 defied the doctors , however , and refused to start the treatment until much later in her pregnancy , in a gamble that could have cost her her life			1
miraculously , she and her husband @entity23 are now celebrating with their young son , @entity6 , after being told that she has beaten the cancer			1
mrs @entity1 , 41 , an office administrator , said yesterday : ‘ when i heard the word cancer my first thought was , “ i ’m going to lose my baby			1
” ‘ it was like i was in a living nightmare			0
we had been trying for a baby for years , and we were convinced it was n’t going to happen for us , so @entity6 was so special			2
‘ i knew we could n’t give up on our baby			0
there was no way i was going to sacrifice him to save myself			0
‘ i knew that even if i did n’t make it , i would have brought a life into the world			0

mrs @entity1 was told that if she chose to keep her unborn child she would have to delay chemotherapy until later in her pregnancy when her baby would be strong enough to survive it			2
the doctors advised her to consider an abortion , explaining that her cancer was aggravated by her hormones and that the pregnancy could help the disease grow faster			2
but mrs @entity1 refused to give up on her unborn @entity64 doctors agreed to postpone her treatment for nearly six months but insisted on operating on her breast to remove the tumours on her lymph nodes immediately			1
risky : mrs @entity1 did agree to have an operation to remove the lymph nodes from her breast when she was 10 weeks pregnant but was relieved to hear @entity6 's heartbeat following the surgery tiny bundle : painter and decorator @entity23 had to look after his new baby son and care for his wife after she spent weeks in hospital , eventually undergoing a mastectomy following the birth mrs @entity1 began the chemotherapy when she was five months ’ pregnant			1
amazingly , the treatment had no effect on @entity6 , who was born just before @entity83 in 2010			2
but days after the birth , mrs @entity1 began intensive treatment for cancer which left her fighting for her life			1
mr @entity89 , 30 , looked after their son while his wife spent weeks in hospital before undergoing a mastectomy			0
