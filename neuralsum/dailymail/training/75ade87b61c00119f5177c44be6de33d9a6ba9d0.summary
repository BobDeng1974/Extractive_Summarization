@entity0 insists boardroom intervention did not play a part in the u-turn which has seen cancer - survivor @entity5 return to @entity7 ’s first - team squad			1
the head coach said last week that the 31 - year - old was not ready to play @entity11 football having been given the all - clear from testicular for the second time in november			1
@entity5 responded to those comments by declaring earlier this week that it was down to the club ’s board – owner @entity18 and managing director @entity19 – as to whether he played again			1
@entity5 ( right ) will return to the @entity7 first team again after overcoming testicular cancer @entity0 revealed on thursday that the winger will be involved when @entity23 visit @entity24 the winger ’s situation is complicated by a clause in his contract – which expires in the summer – stating that eight appearances this season triggers a one - year extension			1
@entity7 allowed him to return to @entity33 earlier this month for talks with former club @entity35 , only for those to break down at the last minute			2
but now the @entity37 say @entity5 is fit enough to rejoin the senior set - up and will take his place on the bench for the first time in 15 months when they entertain @entity23 on saturday			1
‘ i know all the rumours have been out there about whether it ’s @entity18 or @entity19 ’s decision , but let me tell you , and let me put the record straight , i ’ve had no conversations with either of them about @entity5 , because i ’m the one who picks the team , ’ said @entity0 when pressed on @entity5 ’s claims			1
‘ i will be the one who decides if he is ready for it , and he is ready to go on the bench now			2
‘ he was just assuming that ( the board were responsible )			0
i do n’t know why he said what he did but we ’ve had the conversation now and i ’ve put the record straight			0
@entity5 in training with @entity7 on thursday in preparation for their weekend match with @entity23 @entity7 's manager insisted the board have no say when it comes to picking the team ‘ he obviously thinks that they ’re making the decision , but it ’s me , it ’s my decision and it was a decision based on football alone			1
’ politics aside , @entity5 will be afforded an emotional welcome should he emerge from the bench			2
and @entity0 believes his presence can lift a team whose season is in danger of petering out			2
‘ listen , i ’m telling you now , when we announce the team at the weekend and our fans hear that @entity5 is on the bench , can you imagine the feeling in the stadium ? ’ he said			1
‘ there is going to be a feel - good factor			0
’ @entity0 added : ‘ to actually come back and play in the @entity11 again would be magnificent			1
he ’s had a hard fight			0
@entity5 , pictured here in august 2013 , has not played for @entity7 since the 2013 - 14 season @entity0 takes a training session ahead of the visit of @entity92 's @entity23 on saturday ‘ when i first saw him ( in december ) i was really concerned , but i suppose that ’s natural because he has come from a serious illness			1
‘ over the weeks he has got fitter and stronger			0
yesterday , more than any other , i have seen the old @entity5 , and that was the first time i ’ve seen that			2
’ @entity5 will almost certainly be released by @entity100 at the end of the season , seven years after signing from @entity103			2
but @entity0 has not closed the door on a new deal			0
‘ he ’s been fighting his illness and also fighting for his career			0
in those terms it ’s an important time for him , ’ he said			0
‘ how long has he got left ? three months ? so every opportunity he gets he ’ll want to prove a point			0
whether that is to us about getting a new contract , or whether it ’s to go somewhere else			0
‘ that determination could be what drives him forward , but it could also help us			0
