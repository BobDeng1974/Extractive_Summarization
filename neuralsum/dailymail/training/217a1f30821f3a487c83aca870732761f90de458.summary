by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 20 september 2013 advert : @entity3 tennis player @entity2 advertised the @entity5 sports bra range three of @entity8 's biggest department stores have been accused of colluding in a three year scheme to rip off thousands of consumers by fixing the price of sports bras			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 could face fines totalling more than £ 1billion if found guilty by the @entity18 's competition authority			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) alleges the high street giants teamed up with @entity21 to set the price of its @entity5 sports bra range on nine separate occasions between 2008 and 2011			1
@entity21 , which also owns other brassiere brands including @entity26 and @entity27 , allegedly told the retailers how much to sell its bras for - and even when to raise prices by as little as 50p			2
@entity5 was one of the most popular brands in the market , accounting for one of every six sports bras sold in the @entity18 at the time			1
' the @entity19 takes allegations of price - fixing seriously , ' said @entity38 , a senior director at the @entity19			2
' resale price maintenance limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices			0
' the recommended retail price for @entity5 's bras ranges from £ 25 to £ 38			1
but the manufacturer can not dictate to retailers how much to charge for their wares			0
as a result most stores and websites sell the products at a much lower rate to try and undercut competitors			0
the four available bras on @entity13 website yesterday cost between £ 18 and £ 31			0
what the @entity19 is alleging is that , rather than suggesting the price to @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity21 told the three exactly what prices to charge , and even when to bring in increases			1
all three agreed with @entity21 to these charges for the group 's @entity64 ranges between 2008 and 2011 , it is alleged			1
it is not known whether each of the retailers knew whether their rivals were in collusion with the clothing supplier			0
disputed : @entity21 @entity18 , @entity13 , pictured , and the two other stores have all denied the claims the news yesterday follows a 17 month - long investigation by the @entity19 into the alleged affair			1
each of the groups - @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity21 - could face a fine of up to 10per cent of their global turnover if found guilty			2
for @entity13 , the largest group , this could land it with a hefty charge of £ 950million			0
@entity14 , which last year reported annual sales of £ 2.2billion , could face a charge of £ 220million , while @entity15 could end up with a £ 120million fine			0
@entity21 @entity18 limited , the smallest of the group , only reported sales of £ 39million last year , so would face the smallest charge			1
but the group 's parent company , which is registered in @entity94 , does not report results in the @entity18			1
none of the retailers would last night say how many bras they had sold in the period , or how much money they had made from the sales			0
not just fixing prices : @entity2 poses for the @entity5 sports bra in an advertisement campaign ' we reject any allegations by the @entity19 that we have entered into any agreement or understanding with retailers as to their retail prices of our products , ' said a spokesman for @entity21			1
' we have been transparent with @entity18 authorities since the beginning of this process and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this investigation			2
' a @entity13 spokesman said : ' @entity13 always strives to operate within the law and comply with regulations			0
we are fully cooperating with the @entity19 and will respond in due course			2
' a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' @entity14 disputes these provisional findings of the @entity19 but is not in a position to comment further at this stage			2
the matter is being dealt with by its external lawyers			0
' a @entity15 spokesman said : ' we are co-operating fully with the @entity19 and the ongoing investigation and will respond accordingly			0
' we are confident that we have been operating within all laws and regulations and are very supportive of any initiative which ensures pricing policies are fair for our customers			0
