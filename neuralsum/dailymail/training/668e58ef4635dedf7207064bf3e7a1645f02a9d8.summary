@entity1 chief executive @entity0 said supermarkets may be forced to close because of major changes in @entity5 's shopping habits big supermarkets may be forced to close due to major changes in our shopping habits , the boss of @entity1 has warned			1
chief executive @entity0 predicts @entity11 , @entity12 ’s , @entity13 and @entity14 will follow the trend of @entity17 giants @entity18 and @entity19 , which have announced store closures			1
he argued that the rise of smaller stores combined with a move away from the big weekly grocery shop represents a change ‘ as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the @entity5 in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about ’			1
mr @entity0 told the @entity28 : ‘ this is as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the @entity5 in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about , ’ he said			1
‘ people are buying food for now			1
the notion that you are going to go and push a trolley around for the week is a thing of the past			1
it is fundamentally changing the market			0
‘ i think we are at one of those inflection points where customers are acting differently and retailers are going to have to respond to it			0
i think that food is probably four or five years behind non-food			2
‘ what you have seen over the last five years is 12 per cent of non-food space taken out of the market			0
you have had no food space retired over that period			2
in fact what you have been seeing is food space growing by 3 - 5 per cent			0
‘ so , more and more space has been added at a time before you get the impact of internet , convenience shopping and all the other shifts that we talked about			0
’ in what has been dubbed an ‘ end of the space race ’ , @entity12 ’s and @entity11 have already cancelled the building of larger supermarkets			1
@entity11 mothballed a new £ 22million store in @entity69 , @entity70 , and another in @entity71 , @entity72			2
it has also announced that a controversial development in @entity74 will not go ahead , despite a long battle to get planning permission			0
the days of filling up the trolley for a weekly shop could soon be over , the @entity1 boss said closed : the £ 22million mothballed @entity11 store in @entity69 , @entity70 , which will not open its doors last week @entity12 ’s announced 40 supermarket developments will not go ahead			1
a review of its business had found a quarter of existing stores are either the wrong size or in the wrong location			0
mr @entity0 ’s comments come against the rising popularity of @entity91 and @entity92 , which operate from smaller stores with a reduced range of groceries , laced with some cheaper upmarket items			1
last week , @entity91 announced it plans to more than double the number of @entity5 stores , taking the total to 1,000			0
@entity92 is embarked on a similar growth , while both say they are looking at opening a raft of smaller convenience stores in urban centres to catch the new shopping trend for regular top - ups on food			2
@entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ‘ convenience stores are benefiting from a cultural shift towards shopping little and often			0
they are increasingly providing products tailored to specific locations rather than a one - size - fits - all approach			0

big supermarkets may be forced to close , @entity1 boss @entity0 says
more people are buying food ' for now ' in smaller stores , he claimed
filling up a trolley for a weekly shop is a ' thing of the past ' , mr @entity0 added
