by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 7 august 2013 an animal loving couple who adopted a one legged stray dog from @entity4 are trying to raise nearly £ 4,000 - to buy her a set of prosthetic limbs			1
@entity8 and her husband @entity9 have taken in four - year - old glory as one of the family after seeing pictures of her on a dog re-homing site on @entity15			1
glory was living as a stray on the streets but was looked after by factory worker called @entity20 , who would feed her every day			1
glory had to be re-homed by the charity that rescued her because they could not afford the specialist treatment and equipment that she needs to have a normal life but when he went away for a week she was viciously attacked and had to have her front legs and part of one of her back legs amputated			1
and although she has now settled into her new home in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity16 still struggles to get around and keep up with @entity8 's three other dogs			1
the family believe that fitting her with prosthetic limbs is the best way to give her a chance at a normal life , even though it could cost as much as £ 4,000			0
mrs @entity8 said she was moved to tears when she saw the terrible condition glory had been left in			1
she said : ‘ when i saw all about @entity16 's situation on @entity15 i was close to tears and i said to my husband - we need to help her			1
‘ my husband was a bit more sceptical and thought it may have been a scam - of course sending money to @entity4 is a giant leap of faith , but it has been worth it to give glory a new start			2
’ transporting a dog from @entity4 to the @entity61 is an expensive and difficult process but the @entity8 family never wavered			1
glory needed vaccinations and checks before she could leave the country but donations came in from @entity68 , @entity69 and the @entity61 and 350 euros were raised to pay for her passport and medical care			0
@entity8 and her husband picked up the bill for glory to travel the 1,887 miles in a sprinter van over three days from @entity75 to the @entity61 and she finally arrived with her new family just over a week ago			2
glory was a stray in @entity4 but was looked after by factory worker called @entity20 who would feed her every day but when he went away for a week she was attacked since then @entity8 has wasted no time in trying to improve @entity16 's life and the family are waiting to get her a wheely cart to help her move around			1
@entity8 added : ‘ she has learnt to walk on her front stumps , similar to if we were to crawl on our elbows			2
‘ she has been incredibly brave and we want to help her get around as normal			0
’ the @entity86 are currently saving up to buy her a prosthetic back leg in order to help her balance on her wheels , but @entity8 said her dream would be to pay for glory to have three prosthetics , so she could run around like other dogs			2
she said : ‘ we will see how she gets on with the one prosthetic leg but i am prepared to do all i can to help her			0
‘ the total cost of one prosthetic is £ 1365.33 , but if we were lucky enough to raise £ 3350 , that would cover all three , and the mobility that all three would give glory would be incredible			0
new owners @entity8 and @entity104 had to hire a sprinter van for three days to transport @entity16 the 1,887 miles from @entity75 to @entity35 ‘ i would love to be able to help glory walk again and i will save up if i have to			1
' since @entity16 arrived in the @entity61 mrs @entity8 has set up a donation page to try to raise funds from other animal lovers , and said that people ‘ have been so generous so far			2
’ @entity112 , who co-ordinates the care and adoption of the stray dogs in @entity4 , said it was important that @entity16 be re-homed because the centre in her home country could not afford the specialist care she needed			0
she said : ‘ i have been helping dogs to be re-homed internationally for the past eight or nine months but @entity16 had the most major handicap i had ever seen on a dog we have helped			0
‘ i am thrilled she has been adopted			0
we could n't afford to offer her a garden and a cart to help her walk so we thought the best thing would be to put her up for adoption			0
‘ i am so pleased she has a family now who are looking after her so well			0

@entity8 and @entity104 first saw four - year - old glory on a dog re-homing site on @entity15
the couple , from @entity35 , @entity36 , were moved to tears when they saw how she only had one working leg
glory had been living on the streets in @entity4 and being fed by a kindly factory worker but when he left town she was viciously attacked
