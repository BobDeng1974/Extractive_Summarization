by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:13 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:54 est , 19 december 2013 a type of rock that often contains diamonds has been found in @entity6 for the first time , hinting at mineral riches in the vast , icy continent where mining is banned			1
@entity12 scientists are confident of finding the precious gems but none have been recovered yet and there is little prospect of a diamond rush as the continent is protected			1
the team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around @entity22 , in the @entity23 in @entity6			1
a type of rock called kimberlite ( pictured ) , which often contains diamonds has been found in @entity6 , hinting at mineral riches in the icy continent where mining is banned			1
no diamonds have been found yet , but if they are , they might look a little like this diamond crystal , found in @entity34 , which is pictured on kimberlite ‘ it would be very surprising if there were n't diamonds in these kimberlites , ’ @entity35 of the @entity36 in @entity37 , who led the research , said			1
@entity42 is a rare rock where diamonds are often found , which is named after the @entity34 town of @entity45 - the site of a late 19th - century diamond rush			1
however , this does not mean that people will flocking to @entity6 to mine diamonds any time soon as it is not only forbiddingly cold and remote but also protected by a treaty that preserves the continent for scientific research and wildlife , from penguins to seals			1
the 1991 environmental accord has banned mining for at least 50 years			0
‘ i do n't think it 's terribly practical that anyone could actually explore successfully and , personally , i hope that mining does not take place , ’ dr @entity35 said			0
others geologists doubted the find held much commercial value			0
the team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around @entity22 , in the @entity23 in @entity6			1
another smaller mountain is pictured dr @entity70 , a @entity71 geophysicist , said : ‘ it is important to note that the study does not report discovery of a commercially - viable deposit or even actual diamonds			2
what it reports is the discovery of rocks of the type that often host diamonds			2
’ less than 10 per cent of the deposits of similar kimberlite are economically viable , said @entity85 of the @entity71			1
‘ it 's a big leap from here to mining , ’ he told @entity86			0
the @entity90 is binding only on its 50 signatories , but it has the backing of major powers , including the @entity94 and @entity95			0
many expect the ban on mining to be extended in 2041			0
‘ there is likely to be little opposition to an extension of this prohibition , despite the potential discovery of a new type of @entity110 " ice " ’ @entity99 , the journal which published the study , said in a statement			0
but another expert said the future is not so clear			0
the team of researchers found kimberlite deposits around @entity22 , in the @entity23 , @entity6			1
the region is forbiddingly cold and remote but is also protected by a treaty that preserves the continent for scientific research and wildlife , from penguins to seals gold , platinum , copper , iron and coal have also been found in @entity6 and diamonds are already mined today in some of the world 's colder reaches of northern @entity131 and @entity132			1
@entity133 , of the @entity134 , said : ‘ we do not know what the @entity90 parties ' views will be on mining after 2041 or what technologies might exist that could make extraction of @entity110 minerals economically viable			0
’ dr @entity85 said there was a fine line between geological mapping and prospecting with an eye to mining			0
@entity151 , the @entity152 and @entity95 , among other countries , have been more active in surveying @entity6 in recent years			2
demand for diamonds is likely to outpace supply in coming years as few new mines are being discovered to provide the newly wealthy in countries such as @entity95 with @entity159 - style jewellery			2
demand for diamonds is likely to outpace supply in coming years as few new mines are being discovered to provide the newly wealthy in countries such as @entity95 with @entity159 - style jewellery			2
a huge oval diamond estimated to be worth $ 28 - 35million is pictured the last major find was @entity166 's @entity165 mine in @entity167 in 1997			2
diamonds are formed under immense heat and pressure around 100 miles ( 160 km ) below the earth ’s surface in the molten rock of its mantle			0
millions of years later , they are brought to the surface in powerful eruptions and preserved in the distinctive igneous rock formations called kimberlites			0
the kimberlite deposit is also confirmation of how continents drift			0
the region of @entity6 was once part of a continent known as @entity186 , connected to what is now @entity34 and @entity188 , which also have kimberlite			1
people will flocking to @entity6 to mine diamonds any time soon as the continent is protected by a treaty that preserves it for scientific research and wildlife			1
@entity166 's diamond mine quarries in @entity197 in the @entity198 in @entity131 ( pictured ) prove it is possible to mine in cold places			0

scientists led by the @entity36 in @entity37 found kimberlite deposits around @entity22 in @entity6
the team of researchers are confident of finding diamonds but none have been recovered yet
if a gem is found it is unlikely to spark a diamond rush as @entity6 is protected by a treaty that preserves it for scientific research and wildlife
