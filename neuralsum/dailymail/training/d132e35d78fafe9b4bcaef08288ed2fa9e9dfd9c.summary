by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 27 may 2013 for years , the extra wide pavement outside @entity2 and @entity3 has provided an unofficial parking area for disabled parishioners during services			2
but for zealous traffic wardens , it appears nothing is sacred – not even wheelchair - bound parishioners attending sunday mass. as the churchgoers emerged on sunday morning they were appalled to find wardens slapping £ 50 tickets on their cars			1
row : a traffic warden puts a ticket on a car as an old woman protests outside @entity2 and @entity3 church in @entity22 , @entity23 anger : some churchgoers were seen arguing with the traffic wardens for up to half an hour after church rule change : the road has recently been turned into a red route , but the vicar said that they have not been consulted about the change row : the warden slaps another ticket on a car outside the road - to the anger of parishoners the parishioners – many elderly and some in wheelchairs – spent half an hour pleading to have the fines overturned , but the wardens showed no mercy			1
they swooped shortly before mass ended at the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity23 – even though one parishioner had earlier told a different pair of wardens that blue badge holders were permitted to park there			1
the wardens were spotted by a passing photographer as they ticketed up to eight vehicles			1
the photographer said all but one of the cars clearly displayed the blue badge that indicates a disabled driver			2
outrage : a church - goer remonstrates with a traffic warden outside @entity61 in @entity22 anger : the road the church is down has recently been made into a red route so the cars are no longer allowed to park swoop : the parking wardens put tickets on around five or six cars outside the church anger : @entity74 , 59 , with her two grandchildren , @entity76 , three ( centre ) , and her sister @entity73 , seven			1
she had a parking ticket put on her vehicle outside the church churchgoer @entity74 , 59 , who has multiple sclerosis , said she arrived at church to find the first pair of wardens waiting to dish out tickets			2
they are thought to have left without issuing any fines			0
but later the second pair arrived			0
mrs @entity74 , a former councillor , said : ‘ i told [ the first wardens ] the church had special dispensation for disabled parking			1
but when i came out there was a ticket on my car			0
‘ it ’s so unfair , and mean			0
i ca n’t walk any great distance and i worry that i might not be able to continue attending the church where i ’ve been going for many years			2
’ the church is set back from crossroads between the main @entity102 and @entity103 roads			0
cross : a parking ticket is put on the windscreen of one of the cars parked outside the church in @entity22 , @entity23 parish priest father @entity109 said the local highways department told him five years ago that worshippers could park on the pavement as long as there was still room for pedestrians			1
he believes wardens targeted the area after the council extended the @entity120 red route to include the stretch past the church three weeks ago , turning this section of road into a clearway			1
he said : ‘ we had no consultation on the change and no notification			0
if parishioners ca n’t park outside it means disabled people will have to leave their cars far away			0
if the council refuses to budge i worry i might not see some of them again			0
’ anger : reverend @entity109 , 70 , pictured outside @entity2 and @entity3 church in @entity22 , said there was no consultation before the road was turned into a red route parking row : the red lines - which mean no stopping - can be seen on the road outside @entity2 and @entity3 church in @entity22 councillor @entity144 , of @entity146 council , said the matter would be investigated , adding : ‘ regulations do state that where red lines have been painted on the road the traffic regulations include the footpath			1
‘ there is an appeals process which allows drivers to state their case and each one will be considered on its own merits			0
‘ hopefully this will resolve the problem			0
