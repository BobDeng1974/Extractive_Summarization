by @entity1 reporter published : 16:32 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 22 may 2013 a genetic counsellor has helped predict the face of the teenage offspring of the @entity5 and @entity6			1
since the couple announced the pregnancy in december , artists and forensic experts from across the globe have put forward their impressions of the how the world 's most eagerly anticipated baby will look			0
but @entity16 - based genetic counsellor @entity15 has gone further and is one of the first to predict the face of the royal in adolescence			1
face of a royal ? if the couple have a daughter it is predicted she will look like her mother and have a good chance of inheriting @entity6 's dark hair but may inherit @entity29 's mouth and strong jawline if it is a boy ms @entity15 works with families to help them understand and make decisions about genetic conditions			2
but she has taken her skills and helped create a best guess of what the future @entity37 or @entity38 will look like			0
graphic artist @entity40 developed the images based on her predictions			1
with their strong jawlines and bright blue eyes , the resemblance between the images of the teenage girl and boy and their parents is clear to see			0
and as well as their parents , ms @entity15 believes the teenage royal will share many of the features of its paternal grandmother @entity54			1
however she does not think it likely that the child will have her famous blonde hair			1
the mock - up of a girl as a toddler has large eyes similar to @entity6 's , while the young boy bears a striking resemblance to @entity29 as a small child if the baby is a girl , @entity15 believes she will inherit the good looks of the @entity6 , including the full eyelashes and defined eyebrows			2
however , instead of @entity6 's green eyes , teenage princess is depicted with the blue eyes of princess @entity54 and prince @entity29			0
the teenage girl in the computer generated image has strong echoes of both @entity6 and princess @entity54 but also shares a likeness to prince @entity29 's first cousins @entity79 and @entity80			2
if the @entity5 and @entity6 have a boy , then @entity15 believes he will much more closely resemble his father as a teenager			0
it is predicted the baby will have his mother 's dark hair rather than the blonde hair of its paternal grandmother however , she said the baby is likely to bear some of the facial characteristics of princess @entity54 because of the strong resemblance between prince @entity29 and his mother in the image , he shares @entity29 's strong jawline and has his mouth and teeth			1
but he will have the darker , arched eyebrows of his mother			0
such is @entity29 's strong likeness to his mother that @entity15 believes there is a good chance the royal baby will also look similar to princess @entity54			2
however , she said there is a good chance the baby will inherit @entity6 's dark hair , as dark genes are stronger than light ones .			0
