a cold saturday in @entity0 on @entity2 's north east coast is a far cry from some sun - baked cricket pitch in the @entity5 but for @entity6 there is no other place he would rather be as he upholds a family tradition			1
in his prime @entity6 was one of cricket 's elite fast bowlers , taking 226 test wickets for @entity2 and starring in a side that included @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
now , with his cricketing whites retired for good , he is forging a career as a football manager in the former mining heartland of northern @entity24			2
@entity6 took over his hometown club @entity25 in february after retiring from cricket the @entity29 fan has returned to run hometown club @entity25 of the @entity31 , the ninth tier of @entity24 football , where he stewards a team of teachers , bricklayers , students , sports coaches and factory workers			1
with @entity2 cricketers toiling at the @entity43 , @entity6 is embroiled in a relegation struggle , although since he took over last month , the 36 - year - old has overseen a change in fortunes with three victories and two defeats			1
his side are also in the semi-final of the @entity51			2
the @entity31 side have won three and lost two in @entity6 's first five games in charge the former @entity2 cricketer have a chance of some silverware after reaching the semi-finals of the cup his aching back , a legacy of the punishing strain of bowling balls at nearly 100mph , still causes him pain , but the camaraderie of a team environment makes up for it			1
' i 've always been asked if i miss playing ( cricket )			1
no , not one bit , ' @entity6 , who retired from cricket in 2013 , told the @entity72			1
' but i miss the dressing room like you 've never seen			0
' @entity0 is not a very big place so if you come from @entity0 you support the cricket team and you support the football team			1
the northeast is like that			0
' the ex-fast bowler admits he does n't miss playing the game of cricket but he misses the dressing room @entity0 holds a special place in @entity6 's heart			1
he was born in the town and his father was a stalwart for the club as a player and later an assistant manager			0
' managing anyone else would not have been interest to me , ' @entity6 added			2
' it tells you what @entity0 means to all of us			2
' to the family it means a hell of a lot			0
it tells you a lot that in 1966 he 's there as a boy in the background and in 2015 i 'm managing the place			0
' did anyone from my family say , ' are you sure ? '			0
yes , @entity19 ( @entity6 's brother and first signing as manager )			2
he knew what was coming			0
my wife was fine , the kids are loving it			0
it all fell into place			0
@entity25 are the only club @entity123 would manage due to how much the club means to him ' it gave me a purpose to get out of bed			0

@entity6 is now the manager of @entity31 outfit @entity0
the former @entity2 bowler has led his side to three wins and two losses
@entity6 is happy with the *transition* and does n't miss playing cricket
