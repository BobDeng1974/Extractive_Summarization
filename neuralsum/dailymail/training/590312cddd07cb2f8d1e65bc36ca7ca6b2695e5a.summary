he ’s been wreaking havoc in @entity2 for weeks , but now a crack team of @entity5 hunters have caught the wild bear that developed a taste for picnic food			1
the real life @entity10 became public enemy number one in the snowy @entity13 region after reports of him raiding beehives and bins and stealing food from unsuspecting campers			1
caught : ' @entity21 ' bear who has been causing chaos in @entity2 by stealing from picnickers has finally been trapped the enormous animal also mistook a skidoo for a giant tasty treat and began tucking in with his powerful teeth			1
he ripped off large chunks of the ice machine before realising it was inedible			2
after launching a bear hunt authorities finally managed to stop the beast in his tracks by shooting it with a tranquiliser gun			2
‘ @entity21 ’ has now been set free again , but not before he was fitted with a gps system to ensure that when he wanders into areas inhabited by humans hunters can shoot him with a special type of rubber bullet to scare him away			0
enforced sleep : the bear was tied up and muzzled after being shot by a tranquiliser gun so he could be fitted with a gps device @entity50 from the @entity51 in @entity2 said : ‘ the problem is that the bear has lost his fear of human beings			1
not quite smarter than the average bear : the real life version of the cartoon @entity10 has been caught in the wilds of @entity2 ‘ normal rubber bullets do n't affect bears but the cartridges we plan to use contain lots of small rubber pellets designed to drive the bear off			1
‘ that should teach him to avoid man in the future			0
‘ we want him to get his food naturally in the woods			2
’ officially the bear is known by his scientific name @entity76 but unofficially he has become known as ‘ @entity21 ’			0
mr @entity50 added : ‘ we were able to confirm that it is the same bear that been causing problems elsewhere in the area			0
he weighs 120 kilos at the moment			0
’ prior to the capture and tagging of @entity76 officials in @entity5 and @entity2 had warned hikers to be on the lookout for the animal			1
wildlife experts said that the bears were notoriously drowsy after waking up from their long winter sleep and often showed a very bad temper			0
@entity76 had also shown himself to be lazy in simply stealing from man and had probably been confused from his long winter sleep when he tackled the skidoo			2
mr @entity50 said it was an unusual exercise for police who had to take dna samples of the hair left by the bear at the scene in order to help the scientists to identify the beast .			0
