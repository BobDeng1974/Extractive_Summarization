a mother has told of her shock at learning her sons were shut in a punishment room for ‘ long periods ’ at their primary school			1
@entity6 claims @entity7 , 12 , and @entity8 , nine , were often put in the room at @entity10 , which she says isolated @entity8 around 50 times			1
the school , in @entity13 , @entity14 , became the focus of a council investigation after a former employee complained to @entity18			1
yesterday , she described the ‘ disgraceful ’ way children were dragged ‘ kicking and screaming ’ to the space			2
@entity6 says her boys were ' locked in a small room for long periods ' as punishment at primary school it came as @entity27 , 37 , said her boys were ‘ locked in for long periods ’ and left to do schoolwork			1
she said her son @entity8 , who is dyslexic , needed staff help			0
@entity7 , who has @entity31 , says he was put in the room for whole days as often as twice a week , starting when he was seven or eight			2
@entity8 claims he was put in the room for the first time aged six or seven			1
mrs @entity6 believed her sons were in a ‘ @entity38 ’ area for difficult children , staffed by a teacher			1
instead , she says they were alone in a space a metre wide and four metres long with a broken desk			0
@entity8 has described being given five pegs he could exchange with staff for help with work or a trip to the toilet			0
when the pegs were used up he said he was not allowed out again – or given more help			0
he said he was not let out for meals			0
yesterday mrs @entity6 , who lives in @entity13 , @entity14 , said : ‘ they ’re locked up like they ’re criminals			0
‘ @entity52 ca n’t be in small rooms any more			1
it ’s deeply affected him			0
he seems constantly on edge			0
in my eyes that is abuse			0
i agree with isolation rooms , it helps [ children with @entity31 ] to have somewhere to calm down , but what i do n’t agree with is a door being locked			1
’ @entity62 's trustees hired an investigator to look into the claims but insist their punishments meet @entity67 guidelines @entity70 children ’s services found that four members of staff at the school had a ‘ case to answer ’ for gross misconduct			1
both boys have moved schools			2
the allegations are said to involve at least eight children			0
but during its investigation , the school became an academy – taking it out of the council ’s control			1
on monday , the council met with school officials and the @entity67			2
a council spokesman said : ‘ it is now for the school ’s own trustees to decide what to do			1
’ local authorities have complained that the independent status of academies makes them difficult to oversee			2
academies and free schools , now said to number around 3,500 , are independent of local authority control and accountable directly to central government			0
the system was supposed to strip away bureaucracy hanging over headteachers , but critics have questioned whether @entity104 is able to monitor so many schools			0
the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) said this summer that the ' two - tier system ' was confusing for parents who want to raise issues about schools and allowed complaints to ' slip through the net '			0

' @entity62 has a great deal of experience of supporting children with challenging behaviour and is able to use isolation when necessary to protect other children , staff , and to help the child to calm down			1
‘ the isolation space has a roof light and at the time of the allegation had a door with glass and is a space within a larger teaching area			2
‘ rarely was the door shut			0
there may well have been times when children had to be contained in the area under supervision for their own safety and wellbeing and for the safety of others			2
‘ we used that space for about three years and in total around 15 pupils will have been isolated there ... pupils are always supervised and have toilet and meal breaks in line with @entity67 guidance			0

boys were *repeatedly* put in ' isolation room ' at primary school , mother says
she claims children were locked in room , something school *bosses* deny
mother says the punishment has left one boy *scared* of small rooms
school claims the ' @entity38 ' area was supervised whenever children inside
but mother says the boys , who have now moved school , were left alone
local council probe *stalled* *due* to school changing status to academy
trustees say they are confident their *methods* are meeting official guidelines
trustees : ' @entity62 has a great deal of experience of supporting children with challenging behaviour '
