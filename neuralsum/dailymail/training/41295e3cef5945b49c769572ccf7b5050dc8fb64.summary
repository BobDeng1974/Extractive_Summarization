the little boy 's mother found him in the doorway of his bedroom but , despite efforts to save him , @entity7 was pronounced dead at the scene			1
an inquest has heard how toddler @entity7 was ' strangled ' just two weeks before his second birthday when he became trapped between two stair gates installed to stop him falling down the stairs of his home a post mortem - examination showed that his cause of death had been asphyxia			1
an inquest into the tragedy was told that @entity29 , of @entity30 , near @entity31 , @entity32 , had become ' increasingly persistent and successful ' at getting out of his room in the weeks leading up to the accident on september 13			1
despite already having a stair gate , he had used his toys to climb over it and managed to wander downstairs			2
his mother , @entity39 , 26 , who was training to become a childminder , had feared for her son 's safety and so borrowed a second gate to use above the one she already had , on the advice of other parents			2
miss @entity39 told the hearing in @entity47 : ' @entity7 started climbing as soon as he could move really			1
' in the last six months he began climbing out of his cot and would come into my room before we would go downstairs			2
persistent : an inquest into the tragedy heard that @entity7 had become ' increasingly persistent and successful ' at getting out of his room in the weeks leading up to his death ' it got to a point where i would keep putting him back in his bed and every time he would climb out again , sometimes before i ’d even left the room			1
' one night he climbed out of the cot about 50 times and that is when i decided to put the first stairgate in			0
' i did n’t want to put it at the top of the stairs because if i had and he had climbed over he would have fallen down the stairs			0
' the stair gate worked fine for a couple of months , until he started to use toys to climb over the gate			2
i tried taking the toys out , but eventually he learned how to climb over the gate himself			0
' one morning i came downstairs and he had emptied my washing powder all over the floor			0
' he had a spoon in his hand and was going to eat it			0
another morning he had emptied my frozen food all over the floor and was trying to eat it			0
adventurous : @entity7 's father @entity82 said that the little boy loved exploring and would be sorely missed ' i was looking for something to help me keep him in his bedroom because i was scared that i would come down one morning and i would find him dead			1
' miss @entity39 then decided to use the second gate , however just 36 hours after it was installed , little @entity29 had managed to squeeze his arm and neck between the two gates			1
the bottom bolts on the top gate became loose , leaving the gate swinging and fixed by only two top bolts , trapping the boy between them			1
miss @entity39 carried @entity7 downstairs in his pyjamas before lying him on the sofa			1
she then ran into the street screaming when she told a passer - by , hairdresser @entity101 , that a stairgate had ' strangled ' her son			0
paramedics were called and miss @entity101 tried to carry out cpr until the ambulance arrived			0
however , despite the medics ’ best efforts @entity7 was pronounced dead at the scene			1
recording a verdict of accidental death , @entity110 coroner dr @entity109 said this was the first time he had come across such an accident			0
he said : ' the presence of a second stair gate , to me , seems sensible after learning how adventurous @entity7 was			1
' the position of the stair gate an inch and a half to two inches above the other also seems sensible			0
' @entity122 , who is training for a qualification in childcare , had even checked that the gates were safe			1
paramedics rushed to try to help little @entity7 but there was nothing they could do to save his life ( file picture ) ' i have been a coroner for nine and a half years , ' dr @entity109 said			1
' i have presided over some 22,000 deaths , and i have never come across a death involving a stair gate before			0
' he told miss @entity39 : ' you must not blame yourself			0
there is no evidence that getting to @entity29 a few moments earlier would have made any difference			2
' in a statement @entity82 , 33 , @entity7 ’s father , said that the youngster would be missed by everyone who knew him			2
he said : ' he was just a baby , not even two yet			0
needless to say i am devastated and heartbroken			0
' he was adventurous and loved exploring			0
@entity7 will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him			2
' i ca n’t sleep , i ca n’t imagine what i ’m gon na do without my boy , my baby , my son			0
