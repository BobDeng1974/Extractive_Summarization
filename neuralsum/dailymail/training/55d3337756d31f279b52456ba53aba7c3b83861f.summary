the latest in a string of delays and alterations to the @entity4 – nearly 30 in all – has the federal government deciding to delay penalizing about 500,000 @entity5 who have what president @entity6 recently called ' substandard ' and ' junk ' health insurance plans			1
penalties scheduled to hit as many as 1.5 million such @entity5 who have not yet seen cancellation notices from their insurers were set to kick in just before the november 2014 congressional election			2
but now that deadline has been pushed back until five weeks before the 2016 presidential contest , creating a potential headache for @entity17 – @entity6 's former secretary of state and his party 's presumptive nominee to succeed him			1
republicans immediately mocked the move as cynically political and designed to protect vulnerable liberals in @entity24 , noting @entity6 's quest to avoid a @entity21 - majority @entity26 when the dust settles eight months from now			1
if you like your plan , you can keep it -- until i 'm nearly retired -- @entity6 seems to be saying , in a mvoe that @entity21 are blasting as nakedly political ballgame : all eyes are on the @entity26 elections in november , after which @entity36 ( c ) could become the new majority leader -- and the unpopular @entity4 law could propel @entity21 to victory @entity41 fear that @entity5 frustrated with an @entity4 system that defied the president 's many campaign promises , particularly his oft - stated pledge to protect those who wanted to keep their medical insurance plans and their doctors , will take it out on liberal legislators who voted for the law nearly more than four years ago			1
but the most the @entity50 can do is delay the onset of chronic health insurance pain , not prevent it : @entity53 or another @entity54 will have to carry the @entity4 's baggage into the 2016 election			1
@entity21 leaders met the announcement of the latest gear - shifting in @entity4 's implementation on wednesday with rhetorical catcalls and we - told - you - sos			0
' this move is a cynical ploy that delays thousands of insurance policy cancellations until after the elections , ' said @entity68 rep. @entity68 , who chairs the @entity69 , ' in the hopes that @entity5 wo n’t notice the spiking premiums and shrinking options they face under the president ’s health care law			1
' ' nothing , however , ' @entity68 warned , ' can distract from the fact that the president blatantly broke his promise that " if you like your plan you can keep your plan			0
" ' @entity82 rep. @entity82 of @entity83 said in a statement that @entity41 ' worst fear is ' full implementation ' of the @entity4			2
' @entity88 , the @entity87 has shown its true colors by putting politics first and unilaterally delaying parts of the law to avoid political repercussions , ' he sniped			0
' does n't it say something that the authors of this legislation are worried that it 's implemented before they face voters again ? ' will she ? wo n't she ? ( will she still want to ? ) former secretary of state @entity17 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , will have to carry @entity4 's baggage into a presidential contest if she runs health insurance policies that @entity50 press secretary @entity104 derided just months ago as ' substandard ' will be acceptable until just before the 2016 presidential election the net effect of wednesday 's announcement is that many @entity5 will be permitted to keep health insurance policies which , for a variety of reasons , do n't meet the @entity4 's standards			1
a senior @entity50 staffer told @entity113 that the number could reach 1.5 million president @entity6 railed against those options throughout 2013 , and administration figures have called them ' substandard ' and ' junk insurance			1
' explainer : @entity121 secretary @entity120 said the latest sudden @entity4 policy shift represented a way for the government to ease the pain of transition those policyholders will be permitted to renew their plans through october 1 , 2016 , pushing their coverage well into 2017			0
@entity121 secretary @entity120 said in a statement that her agency 's shifting policy would ' implement the health care law in a common - sense way by continuing to smooth the transition for consumers and stakeholders and fixing problems wherever the law provides flexibility			1
' ' this comprehensive guidance will help ensure that consumers , employers and insurers have the information they need to plan for next year , ' she added , ' and make it easier for families to make decisions to access quality , affordable coverage			0
' the nuts and bolts of the regulatory walk - back are complicated			0
president @entity6 declared late in 2013 that @entity5 who wanted to keep their plans could do so , and wednesday 's move is an extension of that one			1
but by the time the president changed course last year , at least 5 million taxpayers had already received cancellation letters from insurance companies whose offerings did n't meet with @entity4 's strict minimum requirements			2
not everyone can benefit from the @entity50 's suddenly relaxed posture toward what will qualify as a ' compliant ' insurance policy			2
state insurance commissioners , not the president , decide whether to allow insurers to continue offering plans from one year to the next			2
and the insurance companies are under no obligation to sell those plans in 2014			0
but to conservatives who smell the latest drops of blood in the water , the @entity50 appears mired in a posture dedicated more to winning elections than to seeing @entity4 through			0
the move ' reeks of politics , ' a spokesman for @entity50 speaker @entity183 said			0
gloves come off : house speaker @entity183 of @entity187 said the @entity6 administration 's move on wednesday ' reeks of politics ' senate minority leader @entity36 declared it a ' desperate move to protect vulnerable @entity41 in national elections later this year			1
' @entity195 will likely become the @entity26 majority leader if @entity197 gain six seats in november – and he survives his own tough election challenge from @entity201 secretary of state @entity200			0
on the other side of the @entity203 , @entity197 , still angry that the @entity4 law 's ' individual mandate ' tax remains in effect for the 2014 tax year , staged a protest vote on wednesday			0
twenty - seven @entity41 joined them , passing a bill by a 250 - 160 margin that would delay those penalties for individual taxpayers			0
the measure faces certain death in the @entity54 - controlled @entity26 .			2

next deadline for ' substandard ' health care plans to *disappear* has moved from just before the 2014 election to just before the 2016 election
republicans mocked the move as cynically political , noting president @entity6 's desire to maintain @entity41 ' control of the @entity26 in the fall
@entity41 fear an angry public facing new health insurance costs and burdens will turn out in force to send them packing on @entity232
@entity6 's party may take a hit five weeks before the 2016 presidential contest , when @entity17 or another @entity54 will have to answer to contented holders of what the @entity50 calls ' junk ' plans
