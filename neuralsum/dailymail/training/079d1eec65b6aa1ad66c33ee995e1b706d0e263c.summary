talks aimed at resolving the @entity2 ticket office dispute are to be held before a fresh round of strikes is due to be launched			1
the conciliation service @entity5 said all parties involved in the row will meet on friday			1
the news was announced as members of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) union continued a 48 - hour strike which has led to travel disruption across the capital for a second day			1
the walkout will end at 9pm tonight and is due to be followed by a three - day strike from 9pm next monday unless there is a breakthrough to the deadlocked row over the closure of tube ticket offices			1
travellers struggled through a second day of disruption in @entity2 today as a row over how effective the strike had been flared between @entity11 and @entity2 ( @entity2 )			1
commuters at @entity28 struggle through another day of transport chaos thanks to the @entity11 walkout passengers on a tube train had to budge up this morning as a limited service meant crowded trains with fewer trains operating , there was a longer wait for a @entity32 - and a crush when one did turn up commuters at @entity40 lined the street by the bus stops as they struggled to get to work this morning more disruption : the @entity11 's tube strike entered its second day today - but all tube lines were running queues : commuters faced a long wait for a bus at @entity51 station this morning on day two of the strike @entity2 said most tube stations were open and half the trains running - but the @entity11 disagreed @entity2 said it was running 52 per cent of @entity2 services today despite the ' pointless ' strike , and carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers this morning , which it said was a record for a strike day			1
around 80 per cent of stations were open and services ran on 10 of the 11 lines , said the company			2
nearly 90 per cent of the usual number of @entity67 were used on @entity69 's network yesterday , according to the company			0
but the @entity11 union , which organised the 48 - hour walkout , accused @entity2 of ' misleading ' the public over the level of services , and of leaving platforms and stations ' dangerously overcrowded			1
' the @entity11 , which will end the protest over planned ticket office closures at 9pm tonight , with a further three - day stoppage planned for next week , insisted the strike remained ' rock solid '			1
this morning queues built up outside tube stations , many of which opened at 7am , with further queues at bus stops and taxi ranks across the city			2
meanwhile others took to two wheels to get to work , leaving @entity94 bike stands empty			0
but unlike yesterday , not one @entity2 line was completely closed early this morning , and many found it easier to get into work than expected			0
crush : trains were running on all lines today but commuters faced a squash to get on as services were restricted commuters this morning either faced a long wait for a bus , left , or getting on a @entity94 bike ... if they could find one no go : many tube stations remained closed early this morning before opening and running a limited service routemaster : vintage buses have been brought back into service to help transport @entity116 @entity118 , managing director of @entity2 , said adequate services were running on the transport network , where all 11 lines were open , and said 15 per cent more staff worked yesterday than during the previous strike			1
he also vowed that today 's service would be an improvement on yesterday 's			0
he said : ' i 'm sorry that @entity116 are enduring more disruption today as a result of the @entity11 's pointless strike action			1
' the only sensible course is for the @entity11 leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to shape the future of the @entity2 , as the other three unions are doing			2
' it was tough for our customers yesterday , but with more staff arriving for work than during the last strike in february , we were able to run 50 per cent of the train service and keep two - thirds of stations open			1
' nearly 90 per cent of the normal number of @entity67 were used yesterday ; we will be working really hard again to further improve this level of service			0
' he appealed for fresh talks with the @entity11 , adding : ' under our plans to modernise the @entity2 , we are committed to a safe railway with visible staff personally serving our passengers			1
' mr @entity118 said there would be no compulsory redundancies , and said @entity2 had drastically altered their original proposals ' after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings '			0
he added : ' the @entity11 leadership know the real motivations behind their action , but it is infuriating that @entity2 's commuters and businesses are the ones who are being forced to pay the price with this unnecessary disruption			2
' ticket barriers at @entity173 were thronged with commuters today as the second day of the strike began commuters used @entity178 ' @entity94 ' bikes to get to work today - ranks across @entity2 were emptied early @entity179 : trains between @entity181 and @entity182 only @entity183 : trains between @entity185 and @entity186 , @entity187 to @entity188 , @entity188 to @entity189 , and @entity190 to @entity191 , and @entity192 to @entity193 circle : trains between @entity195 and @entity196 only district : trains between @entity199 and @entity200 , @entity191 and @entity201 , and @entity202 and @entity200 only @entity195 : trains between @entity202 and @entity204 all the tube lines were running , with some offering a normal service and others a reduced service today jubilee : trains running on the whole line but with reduced frequency @entity213 : trains between @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 , and @entity218 and @entity196 only @entity219 : trains between @entity195 and @entity221 , and @entity222 and @entity223 only @entity224 : trains running earlier but now closed @entity226 : good service @entity228 : no service between @entity230 and @entity231 while a signal failure is mended at @entity233 northern : good service @entity40 : trains between @entity235 and @entity236 and between @entity236 and @entity237 the @entity11 's acting general secretary , @entity238 , said : ' it helps no - one for @entity2 to deliberately mislead the public as to what services are available as it simply piles dangerous levels of pressure onto the ghost trains and skeleton operations , leaving passengers and staff at risk			1
' you can not turn the crucial issue of @entity2 safety into a high - risk pr stunt designed to do nothing more than prop up the political position and cuts agenda of this government and @entity2 's @entity258 mayor			2
' instead of producing bogus timetables , tube chiefs should be around the table responding positively to @entity11 's proposals for resolving a dispute which is about nothing more than cash - led cuts to jobs , services and safety			2
' crowds : commuters using overground train services wait to pass through the barriers at @entity173 more crowds at @entity173 wait after getting off an overground train - the strike is due to end at 9pm tonight a second day of @entity2 strikes meant more misery for commuters - crowds formed at @entity51 station this vintage @entity280 bus was among several old buses brought into use to help during the strike the @entity224 was open for rush - hour but then closed , while all other lines were running			1
meanwhile , a spokesman for @entity287 said it was transporting its usual daily volume of 17,000 people between the airport and @entity292 , despite an @entity11 strike in a separate dispute which was reducing its available workforce by two - thirds			1
mayor @entity94 said : ' the idea that this is a solidly supported strike is farcical			0
this action is the result of a minority of just one union , the @entity11 , who are refusing to see the logic of what we are trying to achieve			2
' yesterday conservative vice-party chairman @entity306 said : ' the @entity11 , who have been used to trying to hold @entity2 to ransom for a long time , do n’t have the clout they used to think they have			1
‘ londoners have voted with their feet and their oysters cards and that ’s a big wake - up call for the @entity11			2
' meanwhile , a cafe has been criticised after putting a sandwich board outside banning members of the @entity11			2
@entity320 , in @entity321 , north @entity2 , came under fire when a picture of the board , which also announced a discount for everybody not on strike , was posted on @entity328			0
the sign read : ' no rmt members			0
10 % off coffee for everyone else			0
' a sign outside the @entity320 cafe in north @entity2 saying ' no @entity11 members ' which has been criticised by some @entity116 @entity336 tweeted a picture of the board with the caption : ' saw this on the way to work ? good to know @entity2 still has a sense of humour			1
' but many angry @entity116 failed to see the funny side			0
while the manager of the eatery was quick to apologise for the sign and remove it , many angry @entity116 vented their frustration at them online			0
the manager tweeted : ' again , total apology to anyone offended by the board this morning			0
was only supposed to be a joke , clearly i got it very wrong			0
' despite the apology , dozens of people slammed the joke			0
@entity360 tweeted : ' how about an apology to those who 's plight you belittled rather than an apology to all the people your boss saw you upset ? ' @entity328 user @entity368 added : ' i do n't accept your apology			0
offer a discount to the picketers			0
' @entity373 added : ' how could it be a joke in any way , shape or form ? do you know how jokes work ? '			0
