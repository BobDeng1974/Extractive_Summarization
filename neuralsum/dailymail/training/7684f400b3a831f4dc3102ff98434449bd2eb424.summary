their riotous show has just won one of the most prestigious awards in radio			1
but , as may be apparent from their names , @entity7 and @entity8 are not the latest young turks of the airwaves			1
they are - at 86 and 90 respectively - probably the oldest women on radio			1
the age of radio : @entity8 , left and @entity16 in the studio winners : @entity19 of @entity20 celebrates his award with ' co hosts ' @entity22 and @entity7 nevertheless , they have seen off established stars and much younger rivals to win the award for best entertainment programme at the @entity29 , the @entity30 of the @entity32 industry			1

they now join him every week to offer their ‘ knowledge of local history , new music and taste in younger men ’			2
the @entity29 radio award judges said : ‘ a joyous , entertaining double act , having fun with the medium and unconstrained by any ingrained ideas of what works and what does n’t			1
‘ they give a voice to a sector of society unrepresented on radio , and do it with a joy that puts many of their fellow broadcasters to shame			2
’ the double act , which has been on air for six years , picked up their award watched by some of the industry ’s biggest names , including @entity76 star @entity75			1
the ceremony also featured performances from @entity79 and @entity80			2
previous winners of the same award have included @entity75 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
however , the ladies ’ show only pulls in between 10,000 and 20,000 regular listeners each week , directly after their station ’s football coverage ends			2
last night @entity90 , 86 , said : ‘ it ’s never been known to have older people like us getting their big break in broadcasting			2

' @entity19 heard us talking and interviewed us for a job on his show , and it all went on from there			0
’ asked for the secret of the show ’s success , @entity106 , 90 , said : ‘ we never stop talking			0
‘ and because we have lived full lives , people want to hear what we have to say			0
we are full of good advice			0
’ mrs @entity90 added : ‘ we are never scared to give a straight answer			0
if a caller has a dilemma , we do our best to help			0
and we do n’t get embarrassed , no matter what the subject matter is			0
’ mr @entity39 has said : ‘ i was interested in older people ’s views			0
nothing heavy , just their stories , their thoughts on the week			0
’ he said he had visited old people ’s homes to find the right people but had drawn a blank			0
@entity127 , left , and @entity128 , right – sacked from @entity129 in a sexism row two years ago – won the best sports programme award , pictured right , for their @entity133 show			1
the sexism scandal in january 2011 , which brought an abrupt end to their 20 - year stint with @entity129 began when the two were recorded speaking off - air about female assistant referee @entity139 prior to a game between @entity141 and @entity142			0
