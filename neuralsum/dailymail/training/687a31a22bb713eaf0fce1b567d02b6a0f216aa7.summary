@entity0 and @entity1 were in opposition the last time @entity3 faced @entity4 – but thanks to a second - half comeback inspired by @entity7 they will now take on @entity9 in the fifth round			1
it was in 1972 that @entity13 ’s @entity12 were beaten by a double from @entity15 in the fourth round of this competition			1
@entity3 boss @entity18 , however , has some recent @entity20 history of his own against @entity4 having been in charge of the @entity23 side which won 1 - 0 at @entity24 in 2010			1
@entity7 struck twice as @entity25 beat @entity26 in their @entity20 fourth round replay @entity25 players celebrate as they secured their passage to the fifth round of the @entity20 @entity26 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity31 7 ; @entity32 6.5 , @entity33 6 , @entity34 6 , @entity35 6 ; @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 7 ( @entity38 80 ) , @entity39 7 ( @entity40 64 , 5.5 ) , @entity41 7.5 ; @entity42 ; @entity43 6 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity43 goals : @entity41 37 ' @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity51 5 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 ; @entity56 6 , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6.5 ( @entity59 83 ) , @entity7 8 , @entity60 6.5 ( @entity61 88 ) ; @entity46 6 ( @entity62 88 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 booked : @entity7 , @entity54 goals : @entity69 ' referee : @entity71 attendance : 13,161 and he can not wait to welcome @entity75 ’s men to @entity76 some 43 years on from their last visit			1
‘ it was a fantastic occasion when we ( @entity23 ) won that day , but this is a different club and one which deserves this game ( against @entity4 ) , they have n’t had enough like it in recent years , ’ said @entity18			1
his side recovered from a goal down to set up the lucrative , televised tie			0
trailing to @entity41 ’s first - half opener , former @entity88 levelled from a sublime free - kick and scored the tie - clinching third after @entity91 headed the visitors in front			1
but the game should have been out of sight way before then			0
@entity3 bossed the opening half but were thwarted at each advance by goalkeeper @entity31			1
@entity41 scored against the run of play when he shot through the weak grasp of @entity51 on 38 minutes and the lead was undeserved			2
but @entity103 loanee @entity7 – as he had done in the original fixture – lashed in from a deadball before @entity91 stole in from a corner			1
@entity7 then got his second from the penalty spot after @entity34 tripped @entity58			2
and @entity18 reflected : ‘ it was everything that we deserved			0
their goal rocked us a little bit but i told the players to keep believing when we got in at half - time			2
‘ it took a lot of character to come back and @entity7 controlled the game			2
he was excellent and could have scored three or four			0
‘ we knew what was at stake and this will give us a massive boost			0
’ blades boss @entity124 rested 10 players at the weekend in anticipation of this game against their @entity129 rivals			0
but @entity41 ’s goal apart they rarely threatened and @entity124 , whose side were beaten by @entity132 in the semi-final of the @entity134 last week , had no complaints			2
@entity136 controls the ball during the @entity20 fourth round match against @entity26 @entity26 manager @entity124 watches on as his side competes in the @entity20 fourth round replay at @entity141 @entity32 of @entity26 battles in the air with @entity60 ( right ) of @entity25 during the first half @entity145 of @entity3 vies for possession with @entity147 of @entity26 ( right ) @entity41 ( second left ) gives @entity26 the lead in the 37th minute against @entity25 and he celebrates with his @entity150 team - mates after putting his side in front in the tie @entity25 manager @entity18 watching on from the sidelines during the replay at @entity141 ‘ it ’s a bitter disappointment			1
we knew what was riding on this and that ’s why i made those changes at the weekend , ’ he said			0
‘ but we never got going and did n’t have any energy about us			0
@entity3 did a professional job on us			2
‘ it ’s scant consolation that we ’re now free to concentrate on the league			0
’ @entity18 , meanwhile , insisted that promotion to the championship remained @entity3 ’s priority			0
but a sold - out @entity76 a week on monday will certainly prove an exciting distraction			0
@entity7 scored a superb free - kick from 25 yards to level the scores for @entity3 just after the hour mark @entity91 ( third left ) then headed in to put @entity3 in front from a corner just five minutes after their leveller @entity54 celebrates vociferously after putting @entity12 ahead against @entity26 in the fourth round replay @entity7 of @entity25 scores his goal from the penalty spot to make it 3 - 1 and send his side through to the fifth round			1

@entity25 stage second - half comeback against @entity26
