striker @entity0 had been linked with both @entity1 and @entity2 following his stunning season at @entity4			1
but has his four - month ban for biting @entity7 's @entity6 at the @entity8 put the mockers on a possible £ 72million move during the summer ? goodbyes : @entity12 's @entity0 is seen embracing a member of the coaching staff on a balcony at the team 's hotel in @entity18 @entity2 @entity2 remain interested			1
@entity0 is being touted as the new @entity19 , who was prone to moments of madness but formed a vital part of the team that won their first @entity24 in 1992			1
not all @entity2 fans are convinced			0
many feel that with strikers @entity27 and @entity29 currently tied for the @entity30 , @entity2 do n’t need to spend big on a new striker ... when they need several new central defenders			0
much will depend on whether @entity2 can persuade @entity4 to reduce the price			1
@entity34 may be included in the deal , but everything hangs on @entity4 ’s stance			2
@entity38 : @entity0 fired @entity4 to second place in @entity40 and qualification for @entity24 @entity1 @entity1 president @entity42 had turned his attention to @entity45 striker @entity44 even before the @entity8			1
having won the @entity24 , @entity1 do not need to make another big statement			0
@entity44 is a cheaper option than @entity0 , while @entity42 ’s favourite @entity48 is having a good @entity8			0
the chances of signing a player banned until november look remote , at least without a huge reduction in @entity4 ’s asking price			2
@entity42 always has an eye on what a player can earn the club from sponsorship			0
so with @entity0 ’s sponsors ready to desert him , @entity42 ’s preference for @entity44 will have kicked in			0
shame : tv grab showing a replay of @entity12 striker @entity0 biting @entity64 @entity6			2

@entity0 had been linked with £ 72m summer move to @entity67
the striker is being touted as the new @entity19
@entity4 may need to lower asking price after ban
