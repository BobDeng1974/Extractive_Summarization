by @entity0 the invite said ' come and ride our mechanical rodeo bull and meet our gorgeous dancers ' - presumably not at the same time , although that might be interesting			1
the prize attraction at the latest @entity9 drinking hole @entity7 is 10 foot - long tawny brown bull complete with huge horns			1
weighing in at over a tonne and costing £ 60,000 this mechanical beast dominates the room at the 19th century @entity15 themed late - night restaurant and party bar			2
i mounted the bull and was told that if i was still on the beast when the song finished i would get a free drink			1
sadly , the track , push it by @entity24 , was considerably longer than the one minute 38 seconds that i lasted			2
@entity0 made friends with dancers @entity57 ( centre ) and @entity59 ( right ) at @entity9 's @entity7 @entity0 : the @entity61 boy was very taken with the bar 's dancers , @entity64 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) it 's much harder than it looks , and was quite a work - out			1
perhaps not as tough as the gruelling one - hour gym sessions i ’ve been doing with my @entity71 supplements fitness trainers recently but i could still feel the burn on the thighs as the brown beast bucked me around the bar			2
it feels a lot faster when you 're on top of the thing and there was certainly no shame in my time - a personal best for me ( not hard seeing as it was my first time ) - i think i could have done better if my hair had n’t kept falling my face			0
the last flick of my hair with my hand left me badly off - balance which i was unable to recover from and there was a loud cheer when i made my rather undignified dismount			0
after that i ’d built up a bit of an appetite and i had dinner with @entity98 presenter @entity97 and the sirloin steak on the menu was excellent			0
although he won no free drink , @entity0 was rewarded for his efforts with a steak dinner , accompanied by @entity98 presenter , @entity97 it was very busy and with a great party atmosphere , amazingly so for a monday night , and i can only imagine this place must be packed on thursday , which is the city boys ' big night out			1
after the meal i was introduced to the venue ’s stunning dancers , @entity57 ( with the cowboy hat and @entity114 shorts ) , @entity64 with the beautiful red @entity116 corset and frilly @entity117 skirt , and @entity59 with the rather fetching tartan trews			0
the option of riding the bull with @entity121 and @entity59 did n’t arise sadly			0
probably due to health and safety issues , or something , but we managed to stay for a dance or three till the early hours			0
all the best , @entity0 xxx			1

@entity0 was invited to ride a bucking bronco at @entity9 's @entity130 bar
if he could last for an entire track of a song he *'d* **win** a free drink
he did *n't* **win** a drink but @entity28 was very taken by the dancers at the bar
