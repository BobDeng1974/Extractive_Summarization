road rage has become a major problem across the world , but in @entity5 the first example of road reassurance may have taken place			0
motorcyclist @entity7 was travelling along @entity8 toward the city on tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear - ended			1
instead of reacting furiously though , he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up			2
' traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop , ' he said on @entity15 after uploading a video of what happened			0
all things seem to be going well as motorcyclist @entity7 stops in traffic along @entity8 suddenly he is thrown in the air off his motorbike after getting rear - ended by a car instead of losing his temper at what happened mr @entity7 gives the driver a thumbs up to make it even clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver 's hand ' as i came to a stop i checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind was n't paying attention			1
' i saw him come to a stop and relaxed , looking away			0
the next thing i knew i was looking at the sky			0
' in the @entity15 video mr @entity7 is seen going steadily along , minding his own business , in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well			1
however , after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped , a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him			2
it 's only when he looks back that he sees the rest of the carnage that has taken place mr @entity7 would have been within his rights to give the driver what for , but flashes him a thumbs up instead			1
it 's the last thing the driver expects and he asks worriedly : ' are you all right mate ? ' even then mr @entity7 remains cool and composed			1
he shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened			2
it is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him			0
mr @entity7 has then a chance to see how lucky he was after the accident after breathing a sigh of relief he thanks his lucky stars the accident did n't turn out to be worse he soon realises that he was n't the only victim as the initial crash caused a three - car pile up , with other motors badly damaged			1
after surveying the scene the reality of how lucky he was finally dawns on him			0
' i ca n't believe i 'm all right , ' he says thankfully .			0
