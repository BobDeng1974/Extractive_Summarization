@entity23 influences : over half of men try to influence their partner 's fashion choices , and it 's because they do n't want other men to look at us when asked whether or not they had ever tried to influence the way their partner dressed , 51 per cent said that they had			1
those respondents who admitted that they did try to influence the way their partner dressed were asked to stipulate what situation would cause them to do so , to which a cheeky 71 per cent admitted that it was on nights out when their partner was without them			2

19 per cent of respondents claimed that they liked to voice their opinion on their partner ’s dress sense ‘ day - to - day ’ , while 11 per cent said it was during special occasions , like for weddings and birthdays			2
when asked their reasons for interfering with their partner ’s clothing choices , a third of men admitted it was to make sure that other men would n’t look at their partner , while 25 per cent said it was to make sure that she looked her best and 19 per cent said it was to help her spend less on clothes and other fashion accessories			2
even the ever - so - stylish @entity64 has taken fashion advice from her husband and gone as far as to change her outfit based on his advice			1

evolving style : even @entity64 has taken advice from her husband and admits to changing her style since being with him ' a lot of times , i look in the mirror and see something different			1
he likes natural and he likes something that ’s “ not so ‘ done ’ ” , which i would say speaks for a lot of men			0
' i ’ve definitely changed my style since i ’ve been with him as well			0

@entity111 , chairman of @entity112 , who carried out the survey , said : ' we thought it would be interesting to ask men whether or not they give their partner fashion advice			0
' the twist to the survey was whether or not men gave advice because they truly cared about how their partner looked or if they used it as a form of control			0
subtle approach : 34 per cent of men said they would go shopping with their partner in order to influence their style choices ' what was shocking about the results was how many men admitted that they tried to control their partner ’s dress sense all because they were not comfortable with the idea of other men looking at their partner			1
' he added : ' if you are with someone , you should accept them completely , and this includes their personal fashion style and choices			0
if your partner wants to go out with her friends , then you should let her dress how she wants ! '			0
