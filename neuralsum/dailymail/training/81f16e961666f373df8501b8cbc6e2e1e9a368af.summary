a jury in @entity9 found the state 's largest health management organisation liable for damages after patients were infected during treatment at @entity16 clinics			1
the outbreak became public in early 2008 when the @entity19 in the city notified more than 50,000 patients to get tested for blood - borne diseases including @entity22			2

' this case is the example of what is wrong with health care in our country , ' @entity31 said after the jury was dismissed for the day			2
' the insurance companies are making hundreds of billions of dollars every year and yet the public is not getting quality health care			2
' and doctors are n't being fairly paid , so they have to take on too many patients to make a living			0
' judge @entity96 asked them to reconvene for proceedings on the punitive damages question			1
lead defense attorney , @entity100 , declined to comment			0

' we look forward to presenting our case on appeal			0

it is known as ' the silent killer ' because it often has no symptoms and goes undetected for decades			0

@entity28 , once a powerful member of the state @entity228 , was n't named in the civil lawsuit			2
he has denied wrongdoing , declared bankruptcy and surrendered his medical license , but faces trial in state court in april and federal court in may on separate criminal charges stemming from the outbreak			0
his lawyers have fought for years to prove that he is so incapacitated by strokes and other physical ailments that he is unfit for trial			0
state prosecutors accuse @entity28 of faking his medical conditions in an attempt to escape prosecution			2
@entity31 and @entity221 also won hundreds of millions of dollars in civil judgments in 2011 against pharmaceutical companies they blamed for supplying recklessly large vials of the powerful anesthetic propofol to @entity28 clinics			1
