by @entity0 last updated at 11:56 pm on 7th november 2011 a criminal investigation has been launched into a mix - up at a mortuary where the body of a @entity6 war veteran who died in police custody turned up in a mortuary more than a decade after he was believed to have been buried			1
ex-paratrooper @entity9 , 37 , choked to death while handcuffed and lying on the floor of a police station in @entity13 , in the early hours of april 1 1998			1
it now appears a @entity13 pensioner called @entity16 was buried in his place in 2000			1
@entity9 choked to death at a police station in 1998			1
it has been discovered that his body has laid in a mortuary for ten years when it was thought he had been buried @entity9 was a former paratrooper			1
an inquest found that four police officers were guilty of the ' most serious neglect of duty ' when he died mrs @entity16 is understood to have died from natural causes in 1999 but her burial was delayed and finally scheduled for friday			1
it appears the blunder was only discovered because her friends and family asked to see the body and mr @entity9 's remains were found in its place in the mortuary			1
yesterday @entity38 , chief executive of @entity39 , apologised and launched an investigation			1
today she said the police were being brought in			1
mr @entity9 's sister @entity42 has battled for justice , but lost a recent challenge after claiming she had been racially abused during the investigation she said : ' as chair of the multi-agency group dealing with the tragic circumstances around @entity16 and @entity9 , i have requested that the police undertake a criminal investigation into this extremely distressing case			1
' as i said last night , i am appalled and distraught at what we have learned and my first priority has been to make sure the families involved are kept informed and given the necessary support			1
' it is vital that the families and the public get a clear view of the facts and understand what happened			2
a thorough police investigation will make sure this happens			1
' now that the police are carrying out a formal investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment further			1
' i recognise that this has been very traumatic for everyone involved and i again offer my sincere sympathies to the families			2
' @entity74 's chief constable @entity73 said the investigation will be carried out by the @entity77 force due to the sensitive history of the case			1
mr @entity73 said : ' whilst the role of the police is to provide investigative support to the respective authorities i am , naturally , mindful of the strong association of @entity74 with @entity9 's name and his sad death			2
' it is , therefore , my decision to invite @entity89 to provide a team of officers to undertake any necessary investigation into the circumstances that have come to light			1
' on a personal note , my thoughts are with the family of mrs @entity16 who , at this time , still do not know the whereabouts of her body and to @entity9 's family who have now been informed that @entity9 's body was not buried , as they believed , in november 2000			2
' officers from @entity89 will conduct the investigation , on behalf of @entity74			1
' this investigation will examine the circumstances surrounding the retention and safe keeping of the bodies of @entity9 and @entity16 and their subsequent release for interment			1
' police officers appear to stand around as mr @entity9 chokes in a police station in @entity13 two uniformed police officers try to save mr @entity9 as a group watch on despite efforts to save him , a police officer tells his sergeant that mr @entity9 has died in another statement , @entity13 and @entity121 chief executive @entity120 said : ' we realise how distressing this incident has been for the families of those concerned and our thoughts are with them			2
' we also recognise that other members of the public may have concerns , however , following a full review this weekend the trust is confident that our systems for the identification and release of bodies from the mortuary are robust			2
' it is extremely rare for a body to be retained for more than a few days in a mortuary			2
the normal process is to establish the cause of death , to formally identify the body and properly release the body to the family			2
this is usually done within 72 hours and the vast majority of bodies are only kept for this time period			2
' all bodies upon release have to be correctly identified and signed out by both mortuary staff and those taking responsibility for the body			0
' while this remains the subject of a criminal investigation we do not believe it is appropriate to comment further			1
' yesterday , mr @entity9 's sister @entity42 expressed her shock over the mix - up branding it ' disgusting '			0
the 49 - year - old said : ‘ [ @entity74 ] told me that in 1999 a woman called @entity16 , who was about 60 , died from a heart attack			0
she was kept in deep freeze because her family , who all live in @entity169 , were asking for repatriation			0
’ miss @entity171 added : ‘ the undertakers went to get the body and it was then they found it was n’t @entity16 , it was a man			0
‘ it ’s just unbelievable – the police even said to me that they ca n’t say for sure that it was @entity16 that was buried in @entity9 ’s grave			0
i do n’t know what to believe			0
’ miss @entity171 has been told by officers that in 2000 the @entity13 mortuary where her brother ’s body was kept had been moved to an unknown , temporary location			0
a year later it was moved permanently to @entity190			0
miss @entity171 added : ‘ i want to know what ’s happened to @entity9 ’s body all these years			0
‘ it ’s like they just went into the mortuary , saw a black person and said “ send this one out ”			0
’ mr @entity9 , a father - of - two choked to death at the feet of four officers on a police cell floor on april 1 , 1998			0
he had been punched during an argument outside a nightclub in his home city of @entity13 and was taken to hospital , where he became hostile , perhaps because of his head injury			0
he was then discharged into the hands of @entity74 , who arrested him for a breach of the peace and took him to @entity212 police station			0
by the time he arrived , he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees			0
he was left handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did nothing			0
they could allegedly be heard on @entity219 footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes			0
they later claimed they thought he was ‘ putting on an act ’			0
but a damning report by the @entity225 found the men responsible of ‘ unwitting racism ’			0
it concluded that pc @entity234 , pc @entity229 , pc @entity231 and sergeant @entity232 – who all refused to co-operate with the @entity225 investigation – were guilty of a ‘ most serious neglect of duty ’			1
the officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at @entity239 in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge .			0

@entity39 apologises and launches investigation
