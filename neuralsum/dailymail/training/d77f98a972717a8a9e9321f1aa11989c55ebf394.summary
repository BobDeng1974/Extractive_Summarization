' people are finally starting to approach talking about illnesses that people ca n't immediately see			0
( my father ) talked about his alcoholism			0
he joked about it , which i think you 're supposed to			0
if you have things that make you sad , express them to other people			2
' i think it was important to him for people to talk about important things			1
' he did n't like people feeling the things that were hard for them they should go through alone			2
' and i think that 's the big legacy , for me and for him and for my brothers			2
' he , somehow , had an enormous amount of people in this world that he made feel they were a little less alone			0

asked about the death of her father , @entity10 said : ' there 's no point questioning it and no point blaming anyone for it and there 's no point blaming yourself or the world or whatever the case may be			1

' following @entity97 's death , @entity10 posted a photo to @entity99 showing a new tattoo on her right hand of a hummingbird , which is considered a symbol of resilience			1
however she further explained the meaning behind the inking			0
' hummingbirds are fun and flighty and strange ' she said in the @entity12 interview			0
' it 's hard to keep them in one place and @entity112 was a bit like that			0
' keeping a conversation in one moment was impossible with him			0
' it 's almost like trying to put a bag around a storm and hope it would n't blow away			0
' some days are going to be difficult ( without him ) , and having a reminder that is permanently there is nice			0
' personal : @entity10 said thursday that she got the hummingbird tattoo in memory of her father because ' they are fun and flighty and strange ' memories : @entity1 is seen here with his middle child , daughter @entity10 , in an undated photo on friday , @entity10 will accept the @entity132 that honors her father 's humanitarianism and his work with the @entity136 , a charity that provides prosthetics to disabled athletes			1
however @entity10 would not speak about the current court battle over her father 's estate			1
@entity10 had his eldest son , @entity142 , 32 , with first wife @entity143			1
he later married @entity144 , @entity142 's nanny , and had @entity10 and @entity145 , 24 , but they separated in 2008			1
in 2011 @entity10 married his third wife , graphic designer @entity147			1
in papers filed in december in @entity149 , @entity150 , says some of the late actor 's personal items were taken without her permission and asks the court to exclude the contents of the @entity157 home that she shared with @entity1 from the jewelry , memorabilia and other items that @entity10 said the children should have			1
the children counter that @entity150 is ' adding insult to a terrible injury ' by trying to change the trust agreement and rob them of the late actor 's clothing and other personal items			2
' the @entity10 ' children are heartbroken that @entity171 , mr. @entity1 ' wife of less than three years , has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate , ' attorneys for the children said in court papers			1
@entity178 @entity1 walks on @entity179 in @entity180 with second wife @entity144 and their daughter @entity10 , then 16 , in march 2006 @entity183 , an attorney for @entity150 , said monday that his client was only seeking guidance from the court about the meaning of certain terms in the trust			1
' this is not ugly , ' he said			0
' i would not say this is anticipated to be a highly contested proceeding			0
' an attorney for the children , @entity194 , declined to comment			0
@entity10 death was ruled a suicide that resulted from asphyxia caused by hanging			1
@entity150 has said the actor and comedian was struggling with depression , anxiety and a recent diagnosis of @entity205			0
@entity10 had publicly acknowledged periodic struggles with substance abuse , and he had entered a substance abuse program shortly before his death			2
according to the coroner 's report , his wife told an investigator that @entity10 did not go there because of recent drug or alcohol abuse , but rather to reaffirm the principles of his rehabilitation			1
@entity10 ' trust granted his children his memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry and some other specific personal items , according to court documents			1
@entity150 says that because he wanted her to continue to live at the @entity157 home , it makes sense that he intended only for his children to have the specific personal items he delineated that were kept at another home he owned in @entity234			2
' any other interpretation would lead to mrs. @entity10 ' home being stripped while mrs. @entity10 still lives there , ' her attorneys wrote			2
the children dispute that interpretation , saying there were no specific limits on the location of those items			0
the two sides also disagree over items put in storage , watches @entity10 owned and his memorabilia .			2
