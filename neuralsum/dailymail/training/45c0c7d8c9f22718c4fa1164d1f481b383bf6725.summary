by @entity1 reporter @entity3 boss @entity2 has defended his decision to use @entity5 as a holding midfielder in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity8 , insisting he saw it as the best thing to do at the time to boost their chances of victory			1
after @entity16 's header for the hosts had cancelled out @entity19 's opener in the first half of the @entity22 contest , @entity5 was brought on in the 63rd minute as a replacement for @entity24 , simultaneous to @entity25 coming on for @entity26 up front			1
out of sync : @entity29 was deployed as a holding midfielder during @entity3 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity8 @entity32 opted to put the teenage @entity34 winger in the unfamiliar position despite also having the more natural - looking option of @entity37 at his disposal on the bench			1
and the manager - who was without the likes of injured midfielders @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 - told reporters : ' it is not usual that we have four injuries in midfield			0
every club that has that , has a problem			0
' that is why i played @entity5 in midfield , ( and ) because as a coach i want to win			2
' i have said that we need creative passing and i thought @entity5 could provide that			1
' my way : @entity2 has defended his decision to put the young @entity63 in an unfamiliar position @entity3 's next match is tuesday night 's @entity67 tie at @entity68 , and @entity46 ( ankle ) will have his condition assessed ahead of the match			1
whether the @entity72 makes it or not , it certainly seems @entity32 will not be experimenting by giving @entity37 a go in the holding midfield slot in the game after the damning assessment he made of the @entity81 international 's previous effort			1
the @entity82 said : ' @entity37 , i have tried to play him in that position in the @entity84 ( in pre-season ) and he could not fulfil my wishes and my philosophy			2
' we have spoken about that and he is more of a 10			0
disappointed : @entity3 's attacking players look dejected after @entity16 's equaliser ' @entity19 was playing at 10 and i thought i had to change the other players , which is why i chose to bring on @entity5			1
' it is because of creation			0
@entity37 can also create , but i asked @entity5 to play there because of the lack of midfielders			2
' when he played in @entity34 , he played in midfield so i asked if he could do it for us			2
i said to him ' you are on the bench as a midfielder ' because i want him to focus			0
' he played there and you could see it 's not so many times that he 's played there			0
but he did his utmost and i can not demand more			0
' thwarted : @entity3 's @entity26 failed to find a way of breaking down @entity8 's defence @entity37 , an unused substitute both in sunday 's clash and @entity3 's campaign - opening 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity114 the previous weekend , has been linked with a move away from @entity116 and it will be interesting to observe what part , if any , he plays in the @entity68 fixture			1
@entity120 defender @entity119 came off in the first half of the @entity8 encounter with a groin injury and he will , like @entity46 , face a late fitness test			0
it is not expected that new signing @entity127 's work permit situation will be resolved in time for him to make his debut in the tie and it remains to be seen whether fellow defender @entity132 will be deemed fit enough to feature			0
it is understood @entity3 are looking to have the @entity135 record signing of @entity137 winger @entity136 wrapped up by tuesday evening , although the expectation is that the deal will not be complete in time for him to be involved at @entity141 .			2

@entity32 brought @entity5 on in the 63rd minute with the score at 1 - 1
@entity3 boss opted to put the teenage @entity34 winger in the unfamiliar position despite also having @entity37 at his disposal on the bench
' i have said that we need creative passing and i thought @entity5 could provide that , ' said @entity32
@entity16 cancelled out @entity19 's opener in the first half
@entity3 have now *picked* up just one point from their first two games
