‘ it ’s just surprising how you get attached to things and i do miss @entity13 dearly			0
our only child was stillborn so you could say the car was like the baby we never had , we ’ve had it that long			2
‘ i have n’t told @entity18 about the theft because it will upset her that much , and given she is very ill , it would break her heart if she knew			1
’ the car – registration number @entity49 – was built in 1961 and has been all over the @entity51 with the couple			2
‘ it is the only car i have ever had , ’ mr @entity2 added			1
‘ it ’s seen a lot			0
we used to go holidaying all over the @entity51 in it			0
@entity2 and his wife @entity18 with their beloved @entity25 1000 in @entity61 in september 2007 @entity18 with the @entity8 at a car show in 2010			1

missing their car : @entity2 and @entity18 in @entity92 in 2009 ' i 'm just appealing for it to be returned or if anyone has seen it to come forward			1
i ’d be so glad if i could get the car back			2
' he recalled : ' i was a motorcyclist but i got fed up of getting knocked off of my bike			0
' we bought the car second hand as we had just got the house and money was tight			2
i thought that i would only have @entity13 for two years - yet it is the only car i have ever had			1
' it 's been to @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , everywhere			2
we used to go holidaying all over the @entity51 in it			0
' for my 80th birthday i even had a cake with a picture of me stood in front of the car printed on it			0
everyone knew me for the car			0
when i first got it i was so proud of it - i still am still			0
second love of his life : @entity2 's 80th birthday cake , featuring his beloved @entity25 1000 good memories : @entity2 and @entity18 visiting @entity124 for his 80th birthday @entity2 's @entity25 1000 , his only car , which was stolen from his garage over @entity21 ' the outside is very good condition and i rarely needed to wash and polish it because it did shine as if it was brand new			1
' the beauty was the battery as it was guaranteed for life so as long as i own the car i have got a battery for life , i ’ve had seven so far			1
i used to drive it every day , whether it be to take @entity18 shopping or to have her hair done , it ’s been a tough reliable car			1
' the theft took place five days after @entity18 was admitted to hospital			1
he added : ' i had parked it up inside the garage and had got a lift to the hospital with @entity18 ’s sister and it was taken in broad daylight			1
' it had been parked there for safety and that ’s where it had always been and yet they broke down my garage door to get to it			2
i always put the burglary alarm on and a lock on it so i did n’t expect to have it stolen			0
@entity2 's @entity8 after its only shunt in 1998 in the garage where it was stolen over @entity21 ' yet they forced the lock off , opened the bonnet and hot wired it			1
i had seen a gang of kids hanging about the back before but we have no idea who has done this			0
' when i got back a neighbour said that the garage had been broken in to and the car was gone , i felt rotten			2
it ’s costing me £ 10 in taxi fares to get to the hospital and £ 10 back and i 'm going to see @entity188 every day so that is quite a bit of money			0
' i ca n't even hire another @entity25 as i ’m over 70 and i do n’t want to buy another just in case it is returned			0
i have n't been sleeping well and i 've been getting up at 3 and 4am as i have so much on my mind and it has got me all worked up			0
' the car was very well known around the area as no one else has one around here			0
everyone used to wave at us when we drove it and it brought such a smile to people 's faces			0
' people who have heard what has happened has said what a shame it is			0
it is such a distinctive car and because it was one of a kind it is more noticeable than ever			0
' people have wanted to buy it from me but i could n’t bear to part with @entity13			0
it has brought us a lot of joy over the years and i just dearly want it back			0
' @entity219 said a man described as white , about 6ft tall , between 25 and 35 years old with collar - length ' mousey ' hair was seen driving a vehicle of similar description away from the scene			0
@entity226 @entity225 said : ' the car is this man ’s pride and joy and is the biggest love in his life after his wife			1
he has looked after the car with dedication and purpose for more than 40 years and it is more than a mode of transport for him			0
' sadly , the theft has added to what is already a very worrying time and he now has the added expense and stress of having to get a taxi everyday to visit his wife - who is unwell in hospital - instead of simply being able to drive over and see her			2
' i would dearly love to reunite this car with the victim			2

yobs broke into @entity2 's garage and *hotwired* the *classic* car
