not a single rhino has been poached in the @entity9 nature reserve since its gates opened in september 2011			1
these incredible images show the drastic lengths veterinarians are willing to go to protect rhinos from poachers , by dyeing their horns pink veterinarians from @entity25 and the @entity9 in @entity26 , @entity4 , are injecting the animals ' horns with pink dye and parasitic poison in order to deter their predators the dye can be detected by airport scanners as well as when the horn is ground into a powder but elsewhere more than 200 rhinos have been poached so far this year in @entity4 , driven by demand in the far east , where horn ground into powder is seen as a delicacy or traditional medicine			1
' the dye is a pink dye , the same as used for banknotes , and itâ € ™ s to make the rhino horn identifiable , ' said @entity47 , @entity48 chairman			0
