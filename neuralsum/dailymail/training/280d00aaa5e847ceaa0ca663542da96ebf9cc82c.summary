it seems @entity2 fans completely deserted the team for the @entity2 ' meaningless @entity5 game against @entity6 on tuesday			1
with @entity9 's men out of the @entity10 , following 2 - 1 defeats to both @entity12 and @entity13 , and with nothing to play for besides pride , supporters were n't exactly keen to tune in to @entity2 's dead rubber clash			0
having packed pubs up and down the country for @entity2 's first two @entity5 matches - when dreams of lifting the famous trophy remained intact - it appeared fans had better things to do on tuesday evening with most squares and bars deserted			2
a number of @entity2 's star names who started the tournament in the first team , including @entity29 and captain @entity51 were left out on the bench while @entity53 and @entity54 were given their first @entity10 starts			0
high spirits : @entity2 fans inside the stadium were heard sarcastically chanting ' @entity58 ' benched : @entity29 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 look on from the dugout during @entity2 's final @entity65 game against @entity6 in the @entity39 tough to take : @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity51 look dejected following defeat to @entity13			1

@entity2 fans were sarcastically *singing* ' @entity58 ' during the @entity2 ' clash with @entity6
meanwhile pubs across the country were empty during the *fixture* in *comparison* to @entity2 's first two @entity10 2014 matches
