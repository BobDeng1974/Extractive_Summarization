@entity0 and her daughter @entity1 , @entity2 and their one - year - old @entity3 @entity0 sailed through her first pregnancy without even catching a cold			1
but when her baby daughter @entity1 was just a week old , @entity0 discovered her pregnancy had n't been as smooth as she had thought			1
in fact , while she was still expecting , @entity0 had caught a little - known but common virus , cytomegalovirus ( @entity12 )			1
this is harmless for the majority of adults and children and causes only mild , cold - like symptoms , if any			2
but if women catch it for the first time during pregnancy , it can be passed to unborn babies , with potentially devastating consequences			0
@entity0 , 37 , had no idea until her daughter was eight weeks old that she had been infected - and that @entity1 was deaf as a result			1
now four , @entity1 is in some respects lucky , as only her hearing is affected			1
for @entity12 can also cause motor impairment , seizures , learning difficulties and visual impairment - which often may not be apparent for years			1
one in 150 babies in the @entity35 is born with @entity12 every year , and one in 1,000 babies develops at least one serious problem as a result of the virus , according to the charity @entity40			1
in fact , it is the most common reason children are born deaf or develop hearing problems			2
however , because there is no treatment or vaccine , most women are not warned about it for fear of panicking them			0
the virus is only harmful while the baby is in the womb , because unborn babies catch the virus through the blood supply from their mother			0
after birth , it is contracted in other ways - most often orally - when it is then intercepted by immune cells before it can do any damage			0
around 60 per cent of adults carry @entity12 - it is part of the herpes simplex group of viruses also responsible for cold sores			1
young children are more likely to spread it than adults , due to poorer hygiene			0
' @entity12 is caught through bodily fluids , such as mucus , urine and saliva , ' explains @entity75 , a professor of virology at @entity77			1
for this reason , he says : ' those who are expecting or planning to get pregnant should wash their hands after changing nappies and not kiss young children on the mouth			2
' other preventative measures include avoiding sharing food and drink with children , and using condoms while pregnant to avoid catching it from partners with the active virus			2
the virus crosses the placenta and infects the foetus in a third of women who catch it for the first time during pregnancy , says professor @entity75			0
@entity0 contracted the @entity12 virus during her pregnancy with @entity1 and now @entity1 has severe hearing loss ' about 25 per cent of those cases have some damage			1
it 's the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation in children			1
yet we do n't do enough about it			0
' @entity0 , a former civil servant , who lives with her husband @entity2 , 40 , an entrepreneur , @entity1 and @entity111 , one , in @entity112 , @entity113 , believes she caught the virus after looking after her friends ' infants while she was pregnant			1
' unwittingly , i put myself at higher risk of @entity12 by exposing myself to children 's bodily fluids and not taking hygiene precautions , ' she says			2
' i felt guilty @entity1 was affected by a virus i 'd caught			1
if i 'd known about @entity12 , i 'd have done things differently			2
' it was only when @entity1 failed a standard hearing test given to newborns that her mum knew there was a problem			1
further tests revealed @entity1 had profound sensorineural hearing loss			1
a blood test showed she had @entity12			2
because it can cause brain abnormalities , she also had a brain scan			0
' the results were terrifying - the neurologist said it showed extensive abnormalities , ' says @entity0			2
' it seemed likely she 'd develop mental problems , although it was impossible to predict as things such as epilepsy or behavioural problems can appear years later			0
she adds : ' her first year was scary - we spent every minute checking that she was n't doing something right , and with every shudder i 'd worry she was having a fit			0
' @entity1 was given hearing aids at two months , but her hearing deteriorated as the @entity12 spread and damaged more of the delicate hairs in the cochlea ( inner ear ) that relay sound waves to the hearing nerve			1
so at 18 months she needed a cochlear implant , where electrodes were threaded into her cochlea to do the job of the damaged hair cells			0
@entity164 was also never warned about @entity12 and believes she caught it when pregnant from her then toddler daughter 's ' sloppy kisses '			1
her son @entity167 , now eight , was diagnosed with @entity12 days after birth			2
he failed a hearing test and a brain scan showed deposits of calcium ( when cells are damaged by the virus an inflammatory response causes calcium to build up in the brain )			2
@entity0 believes she caught the virus after looking after her friends ' infants while she was pregnant ' doctors did n't know what his future held , suggesting he may have low muscle tone and brain damage , ' says @entity164 , 39 , a teaching assistant who lives in @entity189 , @entity190 , with her husband @entity191 , 39 , a security surveyor and their other children eve , ten , and @entity194 , six			1
' as a baby , he did n't feed easily , vomited constantly and hated being touched			0
profound hearing loss was diagnosed at two months ; at 18 months he needed cochlear implants			1
' @entity167 can now hear most sounds , but can not talk or run , is fed through a tube , has autism and displays behaviour similar to that of a toddler			0
' i was told about numerous conditions while pregnant but @entity12 was never mentioned , ' says @entity164			1
until 20 years ago , pregnant women were screened , via a blood test , for @entity12			1
but reviews showed more than 100 women were unnecessarily worried for each at - risk case			0
some who were thought to be at risk were given an amniocentesis , which involves inserting a needle into the womb to extract a sample of amniotic fluid			0
' this procedure carries a miscarriage risk so we lost healthy babies , ' says professor @entity222 , of the @entity223			0
' some women whose babies had @entity12 terminated their pregnancies , although there was no way of knowing to what extent the virus had damaged them , if at all			2
' dr @entity232 , a consultant in microbiology at @entity234 and @entity235 , agrees that widespread screening ' would be a disaster '			0
' there is no standardised test and some can be diabolical in accuracy , ' he says			0
however , if babies born with @entity12 are diagnosed early , there is evidence taking an anti-viral drug for six weeks helps reduce their risk of further hearing and brain problems			1
professor @entity75 says : ' but sometimes subtle symptoms are n't recognised early and there is no evidence it helps if taken after the baby is 30 days old			0
' transplant patients , who have impaired immune systems , can also be harmed by the virus , so their blood is routinely monitored for it			0
professor @entity75 has been working on a vaccine to protect these patients , which could potentially be given to women , too			0
the vaccine has showed ' encouraging results ' and another trial is expected this year			0
meanwhile , mothers such as @entity164 wish more was done to warn about this virus			0
as she says : ' @entity167 's problems could have been avoided if i 'd known about @entity12 and done things differently			2

@entity0 , 37 , from @entity112 , had cytomegalovirus while pregnant
believes she caught @entity12 after looking after her friends ' infants
now her daughter @entity1 , four , has profound sensorineural hearing loss
