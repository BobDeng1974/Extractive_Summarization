a global pandemic is one of the most serious threats to the future of the human race and now scientists have made a video showing how a deadly virus could spread from @entity10 ’s busy @entity9 airport			1
@entity12 researchers have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where			1
while in times past diseases typically spread within local areas , modern pandemics cross borders rapidly via the complex network of global flight patterns and busy aviation hubs and can spread across the world in a matter of weeks			1
it establishes outbreaks in cities in @entity37 , the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 in the first instance they are part of a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world			1
the models rely on the concept of ‘ effective distance , ’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country			1
the maps show various routes travelling from a given airport which is the source of the contagion ( in this case @entity9 )			2
circular diagrams show the radial distance from the disease source and the expected spreading path a contagion phenomenon will take - including other airports that might become gateways for the disease			1
by using data from the 2003 @entity80 outbreak and the 2009 @entity82 pandemic , theoretical physicist @entity73 and his colleagues from @entity76 , @entity77 , have devised a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world			1
the model relies on the concept of ‘ effective distance , ’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country			1
here , the disease has spread to cities in @entity37 , @entity39 , the @entity92 of the @entity93 and even @entity94			1
the diagram below the map shows the radial distance from @entity9 and the expected spreading path a contagion phenomenon will take members of @entity101 's @entity100 wear protective suits during an exercise held at the airport to simulate a scenario in which a highly contagious disease such as @entity80 is suspected to have infected a passenger on board a flight he wrote : ‘ for example more people travel each day between @entity10 and @entity115 than for example , @entity10 and some small town in the @entity112			1
‘ so would it not make sense to think of @entity10 and @entity115 as being close neighbours and @entity10 and a small town in the @entity112 be far apart ? ’ the model itself does not predict how long a virus would take to spread from a to @entity124 professor @entity125 told @entity126 : ' only relative time is important and the message of the video is that the pattern has a circular shape when we look at the disease spread with our new method			2
he said scientists need specific information about a given disease to work out how long it would take to spread to certain places and populations			2
the video shows how the virus swiftly spreads from @entity9 to @entity37 cities , @entity40 and the north coast of @entity39 , before reaching the east coast of the @entity93 and @entity145			2
as @entity37 is engulfed by the fictional contagion , it continues to spread to the west coast of the @entity93 @entity149 and @entity150 and then to @entity39 , @entity145 and @entity94 before it hits @entity152 and @entity153			1
' the air transportation network is used as a proxy for the probability that infections get carried from one place to the next , ' professor @entity73 said			0
while it is impossible to accurately calculate the spread of a contagion , figures from the @entity160 suggest it takes as little as two to four weeks for a virus to reach different countries from its origins			1
however , as 1,288 flights depart from @entity9 to 80 countries every day and an average of 191,200 people arrive and depart from the airport every day , it is easy to imagine that the spread could be more rapid			2
the pattern of the outbreak quickly becomes very complex , according to the scientists , but here it is easy to see how the fictional outbreak has taken hold of @entity37 and parts of @entity39 and the @entity92 of the @entity93 once in a country such as the @entity112 , a virus is likely to spread to all densely populated areas within one to two weeks and peak 50 days after its initial entry , experts said			1
‘ in the modern world that ’s so connected , old school , conventional geographic distance is not so meaningful anymore , ’ professor @entity73 told @entity189			0
he and his colleagues have spent the past decade testing how ‘ effective distance ’ might work by building theoretical pandemics and models that predict their theoretical spread			2
three - years - worth of airline data was analysed to see how these distances interact with the aim of developing a universal equation that would account for the arrival times of any disease across the globe			2
the simulations show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city			0
although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works , it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission			0
masks and hand sanitiser were recommended during the bird flu outbreak as the outbreak begins to subside in @entity37 , it continues to spread rapidly across the @entity93 and in more cities in @entity94 professor @entity73 and his co-author @entity222 published a paper in @entity224 today , which shows that the jumbled , erratic spread of disease can be reduced to simple , constant wave patterns , riding on effective distances , rather than geographic ones , through a ‘ global mobility network			1
’ when professor @entity73 plotted the @entity80 and @entity82 epidemics ’ actual arrival times in different cities against their effective distances , he found strong positive correlations			1
‘ so we do n’t need to know anything about the disease , ’ professor @entity73 explained			0
‘ if you throw a rock into the water , you ’ll see a concentric wave			0
if you throw a big rock into the water , you will also see a concentric wave			0
' if you throw a rock into honey , or some different liquid , you will see a wave that is propagating slower , but it will still be a concentric wave , ’ he said			0
regardless of the transmission method , professor @entity73 argues that his global mobility network represents the wave pattern , while the rock and the liquid show the launch and spread of the disease			0
now the outbreak appears to have completely disappeared from @entity37 but it has spread to @entity152 and @entity153 as well as throughout @entity94 and down the west coast of @entity259 using the global mobility network , we can see how a disease launched in one city might spread to the rest of the world			2
professor @entity73 developed visualisations of this phenomenon in @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity10			0
unfortunately , they also show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city			0
although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works , it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission			0
the @entity160 said that when flu epidemics occur , many millions of people around the world can become ill , and a proportion will die from the disease itself or from complications such as pneumonia			0
it believes half the @entity112 could develop an illness from a pandemic and there could be 50,000 and 750,000 additional deaths that would not have occurred over the same period			0
professor @entity291 told @entity292 : ' i think that emergent infectious diseases are something that we should take very seriously , as researchers and public health authorities do			0
' here , the virus is on its last legs , but the video shows how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city			0

@entity12 researchers have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where
theoretical physicists from @entity76 , @entity77 used data from the 2003 @entity80 outbreak and the 2009 @entity82 pandemic
they believe contagion travels more quickly between busy airports in different countries than between cities in the same country
