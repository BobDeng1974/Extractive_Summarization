by @entity1 reporter published : 10:01 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 10:55 est , 15 january 2014 the fear of sexual attack for women in @entity6 has become so prevalent it has inspired the country 's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims			1
and the techniques are known to work ... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker			2
years before becoming a champion boxer , @entity16 , who won a bronze medal at the @entity18 representing her native @entity6 , had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver			1
recalling her escape , she said : ' i remember i went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress			2
i was 18 years old and looked very ladylike			2
we were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted			0
' but , re-enacting the powerful punches she used to protect herself as she spoke , @entity16 added : ' boom , boom , boom ... he was on the ground - finished			1
' standing just 5ft 2in , @entity16 is a far from intimidating figure			1
but her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of @entity6 as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women			1
in partnership with mobile phone network @entity65 , she has developed an app that will launch later this year , offering basic self - defence tips for women as well as advice and support			1
the app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker , with techniques that are simple for anyone to use : from punches and kicks , to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes			1
a basic version for regular mobile phones rather than smartphones will also become available , giving advice and instruction in text form			2
but the aim is not just to prepare women physically			0
what @entity16 hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves , even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street			1
ready for the ring : @entity16 prepares for another bout of training @entity16 won a bronze medal in the @entity18 and aims to pass on some of her skills women and girls of all ages will be able to benefit from the training and advice given through the app ' the app teaches basic things for people who have not done [ boxing ] before			1
if it is too hard for them , it will not interest them			0
' hopefully , if they are interested , they will continue to learn			0
' the techniques taught are basic			0
but they could mean the difference between life or death			0
@entity6 have become hardened to news of rape in their country , but that all changed in 2012 with a gang - rape on a bus that shocked the world and left its victim to die from horribly inflicted injuries			1
the attack forced the country 's government to show it was prepared to tackle the problem , with faster prosecutions and tougher sentences			0
but only as recently as october , a woman was twice gang - raped before being burned alive - allegedly by gangsters with connections to police and politicians			2
part of the problem is @entity6 's women continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens			1
it is a social prejudice @entity16 has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural @entity151			1
women take to the streets to protest in @entity154 after a gang - rape last october , after which the victim was burned alive for reporting the crime to police ' when i was a little girl i was always playing fighting games			2
i was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me			0
' people try to discourage what women do			0
i began my sports career to help my father financially but people say " you are a girl , you ca n't do this " or " you are a woman you must do this "			0
i want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it , they can do it			0
' i was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but i would not let it get to me			0
' the app is just part of @entity16 's attempts to help women through boxing , having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of @entity189			1
the club is funded by @entity65 and its new ' firsts ' programme , which supports and encourages first time experiences			0
for more information on the firsts campaign , and to see others who have taken part , go to @entity198 .			0

the app , launched later this year , will provide self - defence tips and advice
it is the idea of @entity6 female boxing champion @entity16
the @entity40 bronze medalist had to fight off a rikshaw driver who tried to sexually assault her when she was a teenager
