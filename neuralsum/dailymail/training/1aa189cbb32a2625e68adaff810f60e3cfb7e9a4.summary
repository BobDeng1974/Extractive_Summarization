' ' i think this would probably be about a category 3 - type hurricane if we were to do some sort of a similar comparison , ' he said			1
' it 's on the line of a pretty destructive hurricane			2
' @entity61 hurricanes on the @entity61 , which have sustained winds exceeding 111 miles ( 178 km ) per hour , can cause devastating damage to homes , buildings and utilities			0

but one of the hardest - hit areas so far has been @entity33 , a former @entity95 boomtown famous as the end of the @entity97 , and surrounding villages			2
there , the storm tossed debris onto roads , making driving dangerous , city officials reported			0
waves have launched ' fist - sized rocks ' and logs up to two feet in diameter onto the roadway , officials said			0

but large - scale evacuations out of the region are not considered feasible because weather conditions make flying hazardous , a state official said tuesday			0

the @entity173 activated an operations center at @entity175 in @entity176			0
powerful storms of this magnitude are common at this time of year in the @entity39 and @entity14 , but this storm is unusual because of its northward trajectory and the lack of sea ice in near - shore areas like @entity184 off @entity33 , @entity46 and other agency officials said			1

' the @entity39 has and always will have these strong storms			2
what is different now is their potential destructiveness as you lose the sea ice cover , ' he added			0
' it 's barely beginning to wind down along the coast , ' @entity214 , a meteorologist for the @entity46 in @entity215 , said late wednesday			0
' the sea level will remain steady into the early morning hours and then start to come down tomorrow morning , ' he told the @entity219			0
