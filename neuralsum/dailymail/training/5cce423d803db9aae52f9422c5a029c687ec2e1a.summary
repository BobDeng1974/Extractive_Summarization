by @entity1 reporter published : 13:49 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 16:56 est , 3 july 2012 the ceo of @entity5 says fossil fuels might be causing the @entity7 to warm , but says a collaboration of scaremongering environmentalists , ' lazy journalists ' and the ' illiterate public ' are blowing the problem out of proportion			1
@entity12 , who leads the world 's largest oil company , believes the true impact of climate change cammot be accurately predicted by scientists			1
and whatever fallout might come from the , he said , humans will be able to adapt			0
meanwhile , scientists claim the disastrous effects of global warming are on display across the nation right now , as @entity24 celebrate the @entity26 holiday with record heat , dangerous thunderstorms and the remnants of horrific wildfire still burning in @entity31			1
speaking out : @entity12 admitted that fossil fuels are warming the climate , but called the predictions of disaster ' overblown ' @entity12 dismissed the dire warnings about consequences of possible global warming			1
' we have spent our entire existence adapting			0
we ’ll adapt , ' he said in a speech at the @entity43			0

' he added that the oil industry is capable of providing cheap , reliable and safe energy well into the future			2
fears about spills , environmental contamination and the disastrous effects of global warming are overblown by environmental groups that ' manufacture fear ' and ' lazy ' journalists who report their findings without checking that the claims are valid , @entity12 said			1
severe : thunderstorms and dangerous heat hovers over much of nation for the @entity66 holiday because of this , he said , the industry 's biggest challenge is ' taking an illiterate public and try to help them understand why we can manage these risks			2
' the comments drew a rebuke from many scientists and environmental groups			2
scientists say the perspective is also refuted by the severe and irregular weather many @entity24 are currently experiencing			1
these are the kinds of extremes climate scientists have predicted will come with climate change , although it can not be said that climate change is the cause			1

celebration : @entity94 estimates that 42 million families will travel more than 50 miles to visit friends and family over the holiday scientifically linking individual weather events to climate change takes intensive study , complicated mathematics , computer models and lots of time			1
sometimes it is n't caused by global warming			1
weather is always variable ; freak things happen			2
so far this year , more than 2.1 million acres have burned in wildfires , more than 113 million people in the @entity24 were in areas under extreme heat advisories last friday , two - thirds of the country is experiencing drought , and earlier in june , deluges flooded @entity118 and @entity119			2

' the extra heat increases the odds of worse heat waves , droughts , storms and wildfire			0
this is certainly what i and many other climate scientists have been warning about			1
' the abnormal weather will continue on for @entity66 and this weekend			2
powerless : more than 1 million families in the @entity140 are sweltering in high heat without electricity after a storm knocked down power lines across the region temperatures are expected to be ten degrees above normal and climb near 100 in much of the country on wednesday			0
