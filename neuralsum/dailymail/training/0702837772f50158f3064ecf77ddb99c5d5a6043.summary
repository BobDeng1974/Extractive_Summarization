two prominent black democrats in the @entity1 are vowing to skip prime minister @entity3 's speech to @entity4 next month , a move that a @entity7 insider says was put in motion by the @entity10 administration			1

that disapproval apparently was orchestrated , or at least strongly encouraged , by the @entity7 through comamunications with lawmakers connected to the @entity23			2
' i 'm not saying the president called anyone personally , ' a current @entity7 staffer told @entity28			2
' but yeah , the @entity7 sent a message to some at the @entity23 that they should suddenly be very upset about the speech			1
' ' back channels ' : the @entity10 administration is nudging black democrats on @entity36 away from attending a march 3 address by @entity18 pm @entity3 , a @entity7 aide says @entity12 rep. @entity11 says he wo n't attend , but his spokeswoman wo n't deny that the @entity7 played a part in the decision @entity3 addressed a joint session of @entity4 in may 2011 , and he 's coming back in march – but vice president @entity42 ( left ) wo n't be there the source said it was a ' back - channel ' arrangement that did not involve the higher echelons of the @entity47			1
@entity13 's spokeswoman @entity48 denied it on friday afternoon , saying he ' was not asked by anyone at the @entity7 or otherwise ' to skip @entity3 's planned address			1
the @entity14 is the @entity23 's chairman			2
he told the @entity54 that a growing boycott ' is not an organized effort			0
' but @entity11 's spokeswoman @entity57 would n't deny it after repeated requests			2
' i have no comment for you , ' she finally said in an email , adding separately that ' my boss does not speak for the @entity23			0
' @entity65 vented in another email , suggesting that journalists were out to get rep. @entity11			0
' why are they off on this erroneous quest to make more of something than there is ( ? ) ' she wrote			0
' do n’t you think the public would benefit from more depth about the @entity10 - @entity3 relationship or the dynamics of this snub ( ? ) ' and @entity80 , the @entity23 's spokeswoman , left open the possibility that the @entity7 could be placing its thumb on the scale			1
' i ’m unaware of such a request , ' @entity84 said in a brief email , ' and am unable to confirm			0
' @entity7 press secretary @entity88 declined to provide new information , referring @entity28 to his comments during a reporters ' briefing on thursday			0
president @entity10 ' does believe it is up to individual members of @entity4 to make their own decision about whether or not to attend , ' @entity88 said then			0
the @entity7 also said vice president @entity42 may not attend @entity3 's speech , which is expected to focus on @entity99 's potential to swiftly develop a nuclear weapon			1
the @entity101 all but confirmed on friday that @entity42 will be out of town when the prime minister arrives			0
' we are not ready to announce details of his trip yet , and normally our office would n’t announce this early , ' one official told the @entity101 , ' but the planning process has been underway for a while			0
' @entity42 's office confirmed on friday that the vice president expects to be abroad on march 3			1
no details about his trip have been made available			0
@entity14 rep. @entity13 chairs the @entity23 , and says the @entity7 was n't behind his decision to slip the @entity18 pm 's speech , but the @entity23 's spokeswoman sould only say she was ' unaware ' of contacts between the organization and the @entity10 administration @entity88 , the president 's chief spokesman , has insisted that @entity10 thinks congressmen and woman should make up their own mind , a position that now looks shaky house speaker @entity16 ( right ) is taking heat from @entity128 for going around the @entity7 and inviting @entity3 ( left ) to speak about the global threat of a nuclear - armed @entity99 if @entity42 is absent , it 's likely that @entity132 sen. @entity131 , the president @entity133 of the @entity135 , would preside along with @entity16 , sitting in the vice president 's place – provided he attends			1
@entity11 , a hero of the civil rights movement , said thursday that the speaker 's unilateral invitation to @entity3 was ' an affront to the president and the @entity143 ' that can not be ignored			1

he called the speaker 's actions ' unprecedented			0
' @entity16 spokesman @entity149 told @entity28 that ' support for @entity18 has always been a bipartisan issue , and it always should be			0
' @entity13 also criticized @entity3 , saying that by accepting @entity16 's invitation without talking to @entity10 , the prime minister had ' politicized ' his visit to the @entity155 .			1

@entity23 chairman @entity13 and civil rights icon @entity11 , both *federal* lawmakers , will bail on the @entity18 pm 's speech
they insist there 's no organized boycott but a @entity7 staffer says the administration ' sent a message to some at the @entity23 that they should suddenly be very upset about the speech '
@entity11 said @entity7 speaker @entity16 's invitation to @entity3 was ' an affront to the president , ' but his spokeswoman *sidestepped* questions
@entity13 said the speaker *overstepped* his authority and ' buck ( ed ) long standing *diplomatic* *protocol* '
the @entity23 's spokeswoman would only say she was ' unaware ' of boycott requests coming from the @entity7
vice president @entity42 will definitely be out of the *country* on march 3 and has no plans to stay in @entity185 for @entity3 's *historic* address
