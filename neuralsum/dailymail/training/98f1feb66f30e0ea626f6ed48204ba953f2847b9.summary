by @entity0 updated : 07:15 est , 1 february 2012 the @entity2 government has approved a proposal to open a ' semi-open jail ' at @entity5			1
seen as an effort to reintegrate and rehabilitate the inmates , the concept will allow them to step out of their cells to work and earn wages fixed by the government			1
those sentenced to between five and 10 years and with a good track record in the prison will be eligible under this proposal			1
curious : director general of @entity5 , @entity18 , right , takes a close look at creations by the jail inmates on tuesday there 's a catch , though			1
the prisoners ca n't venture beyond the 400 - acre @entity5 complex			2
they will be employed in @entity26 , horticulture and other contract projects on the sprawling jail premises itself			1
convicts with pending court cases against them or involved in prison violence such as assault , jailbreak and riots wo n't be considered in this scheme , as wo n't be inmates involved in robbery , terror , sedition , kidnapping and smuggling			0
a committee under the chairmanship of the @entity47 ( deputy inspector general ) ( prisons ) @entity49 will select the convicts for the semi-open jail			1
in an annual review on tuesday , the prison authorities detailed their ' achievements ' in 2011 and revealed further plans to make the functioning of the jails smooth and friendly			0
more than 73 per cent of @entity5 inmates are undergoing trial , above the national average of 66.4 per cent			0
out of the 11,598 prisoners lodged in @entity5 , 8,911 inmates are undertrials , including 410 women			0
in an initiative against smuggling of drugs and prohibited articles inside the jail , @entity65 will also procure fullbody scanners			2
these scanners will detect metals stored inside body cavities			0
' we also have sniffer dogs to search for drugs which can not be detected by the scanners , ' said @entity18 , director general ( prisons )			0
the authorities have also introduced smart cash cards to assist prisoners in various transactions in jail canteens , by replacing the old coupon system			2
the last year was eventful in the history of @entity2 jails because many high - profile inmates were lodged in them , especially @entity5 , which added to the safety and security challenges			1
emphasising that the authorities never discriminated between high - profile and common inmates , @entity18 said : ' equality before law prevailed even in jail '			2
to ensure a corruption - free mechanism in @entity2 jails , 32 prison officials were suspended and disciplinary action taken against 67 officials last year			1
at least 18 officials were found guilty , out of which 11 were handed out major punishments			0
' we try to make the system cleaner and more transparent , ' @entity18 said .			0
