@entity0 is reluctant to predict a permanent end to hostilities			1
two years since he stepped down as chairman of @entity6 , the crackle of gunfire still reverberates in his ears			1
a declaration of peace in our time is premature			2
@entity12 , the chairman - elect , has still to obtain the @entity14 clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom			1
details of how the club proposes to stabilise the finances have yet to come			2
and the @entity21 promotion play - offs threaten more landmines than the @entity23			1
yet before participating in the annual charity golf day of the @entity26 , the @entity6 icon expressed hope that the worst is over			1
that @entity6 can put down the circus tent and become a football club once more			1
( left to right ) : @entity31 @entity30 joins @entity32 and @entity0 at a charity golf match former @entity6 chairman and manager @entity0 hopes that the club can move on from its off - field dramas ' i think it 's a good thing for the club that it has settled down now and the @entity40 is out of the way and the people can get involved with running the football club , ' said @entity0			1
' in the last three weeks there has been a lack of headlines and that 's the first step forward for @entity6			1
' the whole club faces a big , big period in its history			2
' they have to get back to resembling @entity6			1
no club wins all the time and @entity6 have had down periods before , even if this one is different			1
' everyone has to adjust to it			2
people on the outside , fans , everyone			2
' there was a lack of trust before			0
' they trust the people are there for @entity6 — and that 's a big start after three or four years of upset			1
' @entity0 exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned — against his instincts — as chairman			1
it is a decision he regrets and , despite the return to the club of familiar faces such as @entity12 and @entity79 , he is 67 now and has no need to embroil himself in the grief or stress of it all a minute longer			2
asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime , @entity0 said : ' i think they are unlikely to do that			1
i made my part quite clear — i do n't think they will ask			0
there is a board there in place and they will make the decisions			0
' i made mine when i left and i wo n't go back			0
' they are not liable to ask me what course of action they will take			0
' a lot of the decisions right now are financial and that 's never been my department			0

the @entity117 businessman was a director of the oldco before administration and liquidation and , because he served on the board during the five years prior to an insolvency event , he breaches article 10 of the @entity14 rulebook			0
he may do so on two counts			0
as part of his settlement with the @entity117 tax authorities , @entity12 agreed to pay £ 43.7million but was convicted of 41 breaches of section 75 of the @entity131			0
in return for paying £ 210,000 , he was spared 82 years in jail — two years on each count			2
the @entity14 are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other , @entity12 has agreed to stay off the @entity6 board			1
he does n't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash , but @entity0 believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand			1
' the courts seem to think he 's ok , ' said @entity0 on the issue			1
' the @entity14 will give their own judgment on it			0
' @entity12 has stepped in , so i do n't see things changing in terms of how @entity6 moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it			1
' it would obviously be better if he could be involved at the club — that would be better for everyone			0
' i do n't know all the background of what constitutes a fit - and - proper person			2
they have obviously got to show a bit of care with @entity6 after what has gone on			1
i think that is what they are doing at the moment			0
' i do n't know what the outcome will be			0
i do n't think it will make a massive difference to @entity6 one way or the other			1
but the preferable aspect would be that he would be involved at the club			0
' @entity109 's @entity179 ( left ) comes in with a strong challenge on @entity6 ' @entity181 ( right ) @entity6 were never likely to be a quick fix			1
promotion to the @entity184 remains fraught with doubt and there are large question marks over who the manager will be next season and how much cash he may have to build a new squad			2
' a few bad results and you get the sack — and someone comes in and performances are lifted , ' @entity0 observed			2
' that 's what happened and it 's a starting point for @entity6			2
' they have to build on what they are trying to do			0
it 's just a start and people have to remember it			0
' but patience and @entity6 do n't really go hand in hand and never have done			2
i wo n't say patience			0
' that goes for all aspects of the club , on and off the pitch			0
it takes time to clear things off the pitch , but the pressure is always on to win regardless of off - field circumstances			1
' there is an understanding of what needs to be done to take a step forward			0
' @entity225 has been bold enough to take the job and he 'll stand by his results over that period			0
' it is going to take time			0
they are not going to jump into the @entity184 and challenge @entity232 right away			0
but that is where they should be playing			0
and , for @entity238 football , that is where they should be playing as well			0

former @entity6 manager and chairman @entity0 hopes that the worst of the off - field drama at @entity252 over so they can target new stability
*rangers* are aiming for a return to the @entity257 as soon as possible
however , promotion from the @entity21 is proving *difficult*
