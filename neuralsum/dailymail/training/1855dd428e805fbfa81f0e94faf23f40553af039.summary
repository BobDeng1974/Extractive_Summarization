@entity0 will ask @entity1 to include @entity2 or @entity3 in any deal for @entity5			1
@entity1 manager @entity6 wants to sign @entity5 in january as he looks to bolster his misfiring strike force			2
the @entity0 want to keep hold of the @entity9 international - who has n’t played since april due to a serious knee injury - and have offered the former @entity12 forward an improved five - year deal to stay			0
@entity0 want either @entity2 ( left ) or @entity3 if @entity1 sign @entity5 @entity5 could move to @entity15 in january but @entity0 do not want to sell him but @entity5 is yet to put pen to paper , casting doubt on his future at @entity20 ’s he has just 18 months left on his deal and , despite wanting to keep the 25 - year - old , the @entity0 are aware of the fact that he could agree a free transfer away from the club in a little more than 12 months time			1
spurs will test @entity0 ’s resolve to keep @entity5 when the transfer window re-opens in january			0
but manager @entity30 wants the @entity15 club to include @entity2 or @entity3 in any deal which would see @entity5 move to @entity34			0
@entity6 is reluctant to let @entity3 ( centre ) go but could allow @entity2 ( right ) to leave the club @entity3 scored twice for the @entity9 under 21 side during their 3 - 2 defeat against @entity38 on monday @entity5 is currently out with an injury but @entity6 is keen to be reunited with his former striker @entity30 was interested in @entity41 in the summer , and has been impressed by @entity3 ’s performances so far this season			1
@entity2 is among the players @entity6 is willing to part with in january , but the @entity45 is unlikely to listen to offers for @entity3 given his lack of options in attack			2
@entity3 is the club ’s top scorer in all competitions this season with nine goals , though his lack of game time in the @entity56 has raised question marks over his role in @entity6 ’s plans			0
@entity0 will take a similar approach should @entity1 revive their interest in midfielder @entity62 ; insisting on @entity41 or @entity3 be part of any deal			1
@entity62 is also wanted by @entity1 but they would still want one of the two players in exchange			0

@entity1 are interested in signing @entity0 *'s* @entity5
**saints** want @entity3 or @entity2 as part of any deal in january
@entity6 wants to be reunited with @entity5 at @entity1
**saints** would take same approach if @entity1 still want @entity62
