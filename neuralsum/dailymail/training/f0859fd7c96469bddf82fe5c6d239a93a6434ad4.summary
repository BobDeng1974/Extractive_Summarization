@entity0 is not given to tub - thumping , so when he steps out of character , we do well to listen			1
‘ when you look at the top - quality players that come into the @entity7 , we have all the best attacking players in @entity9 here , ’ he said last week			1
‘ the big clubs here have huge financial potential and offensive power			2
all the best players play here			2
’ as the point sinks in , you find yourself ticking lists : @entity18 have signed @entity19 and @entity20 to play alongside @entity21 and @entity22			2
@entity24 have bought the prolific @entity25 , @entity23 secured the tempestuous @entity26 to contest his place with @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity30 have signed @entity31 , while @entity32 gladly settled for @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , who may just be the best of the lot			1
the presence of @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , as well as @entity42 in @entity43 , tends to mock @entity0 ’s boast that ‘ all the best players play here ’			2
@entity24 's @entity25 is one of the many top - class strikers plying their trade in the @entity7 but @entity48 aside , there are barely any world - class centre backs currently playing in @entity50 no matter , that collection of strikers is probably as good as it gets			1
yet while it is relatively easy to reel off the names of genuinely gifted goalscorers in the @entity7 , the list of similarly accomplished central defenders may be scribbled on the back of a stamp			1
there is @entity48 at @entity32 and , potentially , @entity61 , @entity23 ’s signing from @entity63			2
@entity18 and @entity30 have nobody of real note , while @entity24 ’s most plausible candidate is the battle - worn @entity67			1
the fact that @entity67 is still @entity50 ’s most formidable centre - half says everything about the current state of @entity73 central defenders			1
yet this is a nation which down the decades has produced more than its share of gifted defenders			1
a top - of - the - head trawl turns up @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity84 ’s sublime alliance of @entity85 and @entity86 , all the way back to the blessed @entity88 , who virtually invented the art. the days have gone when our senior division can offer hugely accomplished @entity92 and @entity94 defenders , after the fashion of @entity96 and @entity97 , while @entity18 would gladly hurl scores of their untold millions at a young @entity99			1
but they are not to be had , neither for love nor for money , at home or abroad			2
the recent @entity104 demonstrated just how bare is football ’s cupboard			1
the fact that 33 - year - old @entity67 is still far and away @entity50 's best defender shows there is n't much talent coming through on the flight home from @entity114 , i met a @entity7 manager , a man who is a considerable authority on the world game			1
i asked him what he had made of the tournament			2
‘ nobody knows how to defend , ’ he said			2
‘ the best players in the world and you ca n’t see a defender			1
they do n’t exist , it seems			2
’ so how had such a situation developed ? an eloquent shrug			2
‘ you tell me , ’ he said			2
‘ cos i do n’t have a clue			2
’ his honesty was commendable , his conclusion depressing			0
because the game ’s inability to produce distinguished defenders is more than a mere quirk			1
it produces a distorted sense of the game ’s values			0
the best strikers are football ’s @entity143 ; hugely paid and greatly feted			1
they are the darlings of the television directors , the names the crowds sing , the idols of starry - eyed children who dream of the glory which accompanies the goals			1
but if those goals arrive too easily , then it follows that the attackers ’ qualities are marginally invalidated			0
and the signs suggest that the inadequacy of defenders is now an accepted fact			2
consider the following statistic : in 2013 - 14 , after five @entity7 games , a total of 107 goals had been scored			1
this year , after five games , the total stands at 143			0
@entity0 said there are many strars in the @entity7 , but almost none of them are defenders now some will see this as a cause for celebration ; the tv directors i mentioned and the people charged with negotiating the next @entity7 television contract			1
but the game ’s essential balance has been disturbed			0
just as there is more to cricket than a series of sixes , more to golf than the ability to blast a drive for 300 yards , then there is much more to football than a furious flood of cheap goals			2
but that flood will not be stemmed until the game rediscovers the art of competent defending			0
@entity0 ’s instincts are admirable			0
the attackers he cited are faithful symbols of his philosophy			0
on those days when the passing game flows and the chances are generated in thrilling profusion , @entity30 are probably the most attractive team in all of @entity50			0
but offer him a @entity99 , a @entity96 , another @entity81 , and he would sell the grandstand for his signature			0
because then he would discover , beyond doubt or question , the true worth of the best attacking players in @entity9			0
@entity209 acting like this is frankly just laughable @entity211 wore the look of a man who had just done something unforgivable			1
his beaming colleagues came bouncing to his side but he responded with firmly polite rejection			0
at such a moment he needed time to be alone , time to come to terms with his shame			0
it was the stuff of @entity222 melodrama			0
indeed , you would have needed a heart of stone to keep from laughing out loud			0
for @entity211 was observing the most fatuous convention in modern football			1
he was ostentatiously refusing to celebrate the goal he had just scored , on the grounds that he had scored it against his former club			0
@entity211 's non-celebration when he scored for @entity32 against @entity24 was nauseating the entire exercise reeked of calculation , as it always does			1
the @entity32 fans would be so cheered by the goal that they would overlook the absence of celebration			0
the @entity24 fans would see the stricken face of their old favourite and tell themselves : ‘ dear old @entity211 ’s still one of us ’			1
yet the fact is that @entity211 is now employed by @entity32			1
he joined them because @entity24 decided that they no longer needed him			1
that ’s how professional football works , as @entity211 knows full well			1
nobody was expecting extravagant , knee - sliding glee last weekend , just a simple recognition that he had done his job			2
the counterfeit remorse convinced nobody but the terminally gullible			0
a yellow card for simulation should greet the next player to pull the stunt			0
@entity209 acting deserves no less			0
@entity262 @entity261 rewarded by @entity263 @entity264 have rejected calls to publish their own report into alleged corruption in the bidding for the @entity269 of 2018 and 2022			1
having commissioned the report , @entity263 has discovered it was telling uncomfortable truths			2
enforced silence was his predictable response			0
in a busy week , it offered a brief distraction from his efforts to organise his fifth term as @entity264 president			1
yet there was one matter which almost sneaked past the public gaze			0
@entity264 decided to ban the third - party ownership of players			1
former @entity286 chairman @entity261 endorsed @entity263 for his current presidential term so they set up a working party			0
and who is to be chair ? i give you mr @entity261 , former chairman of our own @entity286			0
in nine years as @entity286 chairman , he never cast a shadow			0
indeed , there were those who seriously doubted his very existence			0
but he did sign a letter endorsing @entity263 for his current presidential term and , in @entity263 ’s world , no sycophantic deed goes unrewarded			2
so @entity261 heads working parties , where he will rock no boats , drop no bricks and say nothing because he has nothing to say			0
in short , he is innocuous , insipid and practically invisible ; inaction man to the life			0
mark my words , our @entity261 could go a long way in @entity264			1
@entity314 a reporter from @entity316 met the @entity318 owner @entity317 outside a @entity320 pub. @entity317 offered this assessment of @entity323 ’s career prospects : ‘ @entity324			1
one more game then that ’s it			0
what would you do ? i have spent a lot of money on that club , it has cost me a lot			0
i wo n’t put up with it any more			0
’ later , @entity317 ’s lawyers ‘ interpreted ’ the remarks			1
they used the term ‘ tongue in cheek ’			1
they explained that @entity317 was ‘ humouring ’ the reporter			1
you will form your own conclusion			0
i know which version i believe			0
@entity318 owner @entity317 denied he was being serious in saying manager @entity323 could lose his job like our @entity18 facebook page here			1
like our @entity346 here .			0

@entity7 has plenty of top strikers like @entity24 's @entity25
but there is a dearth of quality centre backs in the division
very few @entity73 central defenders are coming through
across world football , there are n't many top - class central defenders
@entity211 needs to get over himself with his non-celebration
it 's no *surprise* that @entity264 have rejected calls to publish their own report into alleged corruption in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 @entity269
@entity317 's ' tongue - in - cheek ' assessment of @entity323 was no joke
