with a family background in food , the women started in a tiny kitchen in @entity51 and now they 're getting set to launch their own biskies pop - up in @entity85 food hall on june 30			1

being health - conscious , @entity73 and @entity74 use only the best natural ingredients for all their products and reduce fat where possible			0

almost healthy ? their specially created buttercream is made with half the amount of butter and sugar normally used in baking and their homemade jams are made with real fruit they also do not use any margarine or hydro - fats and , where possible , use ingredients sourced from @entity117 producers , they say			2
speaking about their creation , they said : ' we are both self - taught bakers with no formal training but set up @entity123 & @entity124 , a new innovative - baked goods company based in @entity126 in 2013			1
' our cooking ethos is to use all natural ingredients - no artificial colourings or flavourings			0
when we are creating something with passion fruit then it is made out of fresh passion fruits which we cut and scoop our ourselves , it 's more expensive and time - consuming than buying ready - made puree but the flavour from a fresh passion fruit is unparalleled			0
' if the biskie is green it 's because we 've used premium @entity142 green tea which is naturally vibrant green , no need for artificial colourings and it tastes amazing			1
' we have even created our own colour tints from fruits , veggies and spices to colour our own flowers and sprinkles			2
it is amazing how many colours you can derive from a red cabbage ( including green ! ) using a bit of natural kitchen chemistry			2
' so what do they taste like ? @entity160 's resident food expert , @entity159 , said : ‘ when we thought there were enough hybrids in the world ( cronuts , labradoodles and @entity167 ) , they found another			0
' a funny cross between a whoopee pie and an ice cream sandwich , it ’s fair to say that the three quarters i managed to wrestle to myself were not enough			0
' the spiced vanilla and passionfruit was particularly moreish with its chewy exterior and creamy centre , this ai n’t no rich tea ! ’			2
brains behind biskies : the creators of the biskie are @entity73 and @entity74 , two food - obsessed sisters who run the @entity123 & @entity124 bakery is this the death of the cronut ? the croissant - donut hybrid was the hit of the year but the biskie hopes to knock it from the top spot as the most famous sweet treat			1
