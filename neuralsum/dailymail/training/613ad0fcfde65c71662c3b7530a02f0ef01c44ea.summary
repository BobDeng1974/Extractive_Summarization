by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 4 july 2013 @entity1 : home secretary @entity2 has banned the @entity5 herbal stimulant @entity3 @entity2 yesterday over-ruled her own drug advisers to ban a herbal stimulant linked to @entity9 extremism			1
the home secretary said that , if she did not act , @entity10 could become a transit route for illegally shipping khat into mainland @entity13			1
the amphetamine - like substance is already banned in most @entity13 countries , including @entity17 , @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
security experts have also warned that proceeds from selling the drug could be fuelling @entity9 extremist groups , such as @entity26			1
mrs may said that khat , which is popular among @entity29 living in the @entity10 , would become a @entity31 drug like anabolic steroids			1
the move will be controversial because it goes against the advice of the @entity35			2
in january the @entity35 said there was ‘ insufficient evidence ’ that khat caused health problems			2
the panel also found ‘ no evidence ’ that khat , made from leaves and shoots of a shrub cultivated in the @entity44 and the @entity45 , was directly linked with serious or organised crime			2
but , in a statement to mps , mrs may said the risks posed could have been underestimated			1
she said : ‘ failure to take decisive action and change the @entity10 ’s legislative position on khat would place the @entity10 at a serious risk of becoming a single , regional hub for [ its ] illegal onward trafficking			1
‘ seizures of khat transiting the @entity10 en route to the @entity19 have already been increasing in size and frequency since the @entity19 ban earlier this year			1
’ @entity3 is imported from @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			0
about 2,560 tonnes of khat were imported in 2011 - 12 with a value of £ 13.8m			2
it is usually chewed at social events in family homes , at community parties or at legal khat cafes			0
users chew one or two bundles of khat for up to six hours at a time to produce a mild stimulant effect			0
@entity29 groups in the @entity10 had told the @entity35 that use of khat was a ‘ significant social problem ’ and said it caused medical issues and family breakdowns			1
the @entity35 said withdrawal symptoms such as tiredness and depression were associated with khat			0
the @entity81 said the ban was intended to ‘ protect vulnerable members of our communities ’ and would be brought in at the ‘ earliest possible opportunity ’			0
terror links : bundles of khat on sale in @entity91 , @entity29			0
security experts have warned that proceeds from selling the drug could be fuelling @entity9 extremist groups , such as @entity26 the decision risks sparking a new row between the government and the science world			1
previous decisions to over-rule the @entity35 on cannabis and @entity102 drew a furious response which threatened to split the committee			0
last week , professor @entity105 , former head of the @entity35 , said banning the substance would show ‘ contempt for reason and evidence ’			2
last night , police suggested users would escape with a warning the first time they were caught			0
chief constable @entity114 , spokesman for the association of chief police officers , said : ‘ as with other forms of drug misuse , the police response will be proportionate			2
‘ activity is likely to be enhanced where there is also intelligence about associated crime or anti-social behaviour			0
‘ there may be a case for police action to follow similar lines to the approach used for cannabis possession offences , where a first offence by an adult generally attracts a warning and a second the issuing of a penalty notice before escalating to arrest and prosecution			0
‘ we will explore this possibility with the @entity81 and with the @entity139 over forthcoming weeks			0
