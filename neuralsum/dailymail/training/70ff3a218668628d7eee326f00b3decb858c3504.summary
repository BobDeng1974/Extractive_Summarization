@entity0 confirms he is leaving @entity1 - click here to read another year gone , and another @entity1 first - team player has opted for pastures new			1
but unlike @entity5 two years ago , @entity0 should not be subject to abuse			1
the right back announced on thursday that it was a certainty he will be leaving this summer , declining the club 's final three - year contract offer of £ 80,000 - a - week			1
and even though @entity0 looks to be joining a host of former gunners at @entity13 , it 's hard to blame a player who has been a loyal servant at the @entity15			1
signing on with the hope of joining @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 as @entity24 who lifted multiple trophies in north @entity32 , a fourth - place finish and limited @entity35 joy was the new realistic target			1
in the midst of the lowest lows , @entity0 was always one who would roll his sleeves up , never give in and urge team - mates to pick themselves up			1
it 's no wonder @entity42 was so keen to break his ' no long contract for over- 30s ' rule to keep one of his most consistent performers			0
@entity47 understands a £ 150,000 - a - week deal with @entity13 has been lined up , leading to many @entity1 fans to criticise @entity0 for ' showing no respect ' and taking one final pay check			1
but after eight years of being heralded as one of the best full backs in the league with barely anything in the shape of trophies to back that up , is it not just one final challenge for a player still at his peak ? put simply , if it was about moving for silverware ( as @entity65 justifies his move to @entity13 ) right now is not the time to do it			1
leaving under a cloud : @entity65 left @entity1 for @entity13 all worth it : @entity65 has won two @entity70 titles since his move to @entity13 ' anything we win here will come from the heart and that ’s what i want			1
' it ’s my dream and i see no point in speaking about other teams when i have these dreams			0
' i think other people know that about me ; i ’m just hungry to win with @entity1 and that ’s it			1
' @entity0 's reaction at the end of that @entity22 final win , nine years after their last triumph , said it all			1
success is all he wanted at a club he obviously loves , and now he 's got that , why not let him respond to other club 's advances ? he , and the fans , have got what they wanted			0
after one of his finest seasons in an @entity1 shirt battling back from injury , it 's the least @entity0 deserves			1
this stance was not applicable to @entity5 , @entity65 and @entity105 's exits , though			0
@entity106 , back in 2011 , said : ' i ’m sure i could win things at another team in another country , but would it feel like our trophy , my trophy ? i ’m not sure it would			0
' anything we win here will come from the heart and that ’s what i want			0
it ’s my dream and i see no point in speaking about other teams when i have these dreams			0
i think other people know that about me ; i ’m just hungry to win with @entity1 and that ’s it			2
' those quotes - along with the pictures of @entity106 surrounded by @entity1 bedsheets and posters as a youngster - were music to fans ' ears at the time , but now seem fake and twisted			2
the club stuck by the @entity135 through countless seasons as he struggled with various knocks , but after one - and - a - half injury - free seasons scoring goals he had made his decision			0
a move to @entity142 followed , and @entity106 even went on to write an open letter to @entity1 criticising their ambition			2
the respect was long gone after that			0
time to go : @entity5 left @entity1 after questioning their ambition landing the big one : @entity106 won the @entity70 in his first season @entity65 had the chance to be the ' next @entity151 ' after the @entity152 left for his boyhood club @entity153 ( something he always admitted he was planning to do )			2
@entity65 could have been the hero of a side in need of one , he could have repaid @entity42 for putting trust in him at such a young age			0
he has been accused of taking the ' easy way out ' of @entity1 , quitting as soon as some sort of crisis became apparent , and as soon as a suitable club threw money at him			2
the departure of @entity105 - along with @entity166 and @entity167 - was n't so critical on the pitch , but the @entity169 angered fans with his attitude ( and not least for sprinting the length of the pitch to celebrate a goal for @entity13 against @entity1 back in 2009 )			1
he constantly flirted with @entity175 , and in fact @entity42 was fortunate to pocket £ 25m for the striker			0
on his way : @entity105 left @entity1 to join @entity13 bad move : @entity105 celebrates scoring for @entity13 in front of the @entity1 fans all this is in such contrast to @entity0 , who was humble about his exit			1
take his quotes in @entity186 : ' it was an honour to grow in the shirt , ' he said			0
' @entity1 is a club that brought me a lot , both as a person and as a sportsman			2
even though we had been criticised for quite some time due to the lack of trophies , i spent some magical moments ( at @entity1 )			2
if i had to do , i ’d do it again			0
' out of all that , his admission that he would do it again really stands out			0
at 31 years of age , the time is right for @entity0 to bow out , and @entity1 can look for a younger , and perhaps cheaper alternative			1
@entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 have been linked with a move , but they will find it hard to match @entity0 's ability , not least his dedication			0
the time is right for a thanks , and good luck .			0

@entity0 announced on thursday that he will be leaving @entity1
@entity24 defender signed for £ 7.5m in 2006
@entity0 has *reportedly* lined up a deal at @entity13
@entity1 will now look for a younger , cheaper option at right back
