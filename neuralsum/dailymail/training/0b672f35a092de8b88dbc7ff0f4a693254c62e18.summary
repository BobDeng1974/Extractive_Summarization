but on arrival at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , the 51 - year - old was devastated to learn that he was too late and his mother had passed away			2
however , his despair soon turned to shock after learning that the elderly woman they were being shown wasnot his mother @entity21 , who was actually still alive - and lying in the neighbouring bed			2
the mix - up was discovered by his wife @entity24 , also 51 , who was taken behind the curtain to see the body first as her husband composed himself			2
she was initially horrified by the apparent dramatic change in her mother - in - law 's appearance - before realising the nurses ' mistake			1
' i went in first to allow @entity7 a moment to gather his thoughts , ' said mrs @entity36			0
' a nurse walked me to the bed with the curtains drawn and asked if i wanted her to come in with me , but i said i ’d be fine			0
' i went behind the curtain and straight away thought : " what on earth has happened to my poor mother - in - law ? " her face was swollen and puffy			1
' but when i went up to the head of the bed and saw this lady had white hair - @entity21 ’s was brown			0
' i was in so much shock i started shouting hysterically : " this is not my mother - in - law ! '' ' nurses then realised the mistake and took the aghast pair to see their elderly relative , who was alive in the neighbouring bed			1
