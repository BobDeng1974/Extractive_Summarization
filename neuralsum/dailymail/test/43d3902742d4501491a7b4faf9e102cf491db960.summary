' you guys ready to play some golf ? ' asked the starter			2
and , yes he was			2
that 's exactly what @entity5 was ready for			1
he smiled , slapped his playing partner @entity9 on the back			1
damn right he was ready			2
by the summer , though , who knows ? there have been enough sightings of the old @entity5 at @entity14 this week not to give up on him yet			1
the problem with new @entity5 , though , is that as desperate as he appears to march on , obstacles line his path , like tree roots			1
in some cases , exactly like tree roots			2
at the ninth , playing out of the @entity14 pines , @entity5 found such a root at full pelt on his follow through			1
he dropped his club like a red - hot poker , face creased with pain			0
woods claimed that a bone popped out in his right arm , right there , but he reset it			0
there was a degree of scepticism about the extent of that injury , but either way it continued to bother him for several holes and was rotten luck			0
there is , however , a well - worn method of avoiding such misfortune			0
hit it on the fairway			0
woods did not find a solitary preferred landing area until the 13th , when he was rewarded with an eagle			0
up to that point , he spent so much time in the trees he should have been fitted with a lumberjack shirt			0
at the tenth he was in so deep they were thinking of sending @entity57 for help			0
@entity5 looks over his second shot on the seventh hole as the @entity14 crowd look on @entity5 ( left ) speaks to playing partner @entity9 as the pair wait to tee off on the first tee @entity5 reacts in pain after hitting a shot out of the pine straw on the ninth hole still , it could have been worse			1
this was the masters that @entity5 was advised to miss. there were some sage voices out there , saying his old friend would turn on him , that he might be embarrassed by his favourite homeland course			1
his game was broken , he was broken , it was argued			0
this was no country for an old man with faltering short irons			0
some folk wanted their happy memories preserved			0
these four days , however , have revealed a healthier reality			0
woods did n't come back too soon , he just took his leave too late			0
looking at the tournaments he played in january and february , it was plain he did n't want to be there			0
he should have called time out then			0
had he done so , had he started his recovery earlier , who knows where his game would have been by the time he reached @entity14 ? were it not for the phenomenon of @entity99 's first 54 holes , he would have been in contention here starting the final day			1
woods , like @entity9 , began six under par but with @entity99 ten shots ahead , it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge			1
@entity102 would have needed a score approaching the course record , and @entity99 a collapse – and he is not well - placed for miracles yet			1
another major ? well , you would n't bet against that one			0
@entity5 tees off on the tenth but in the end he did not manage to challenge runaway winner @entity99 @entity5 plays out of the bunker by the sixteenth green at @entity117 it could be argued that the enthusiasm for @entity5 's performance this weekend shows how far he has fallen			1
after all , two of his four rounds – the first and last – were over par , and in the head to head on sunday @entity9 beat him by seven shots			1
this was far from tournament winning golf			0
then again @entity9 is the world no 1 , @entity5 110 places below and has barely played this year			1
he has reshaped his swing which continues to be a work in progress			0
he would not say when he will play next after this			0
' it wo n't be for a while , ' @entity5 confirmed			1
' i like what i 'm doing , so i 'm going to go back and work on that			0
' where this will leave him for the @entity145 short - term it is hard to say			0
he finished in the top 20 here , his best return since 2013 and many rated this as the best of several recent comebacks , one that inspired speculation about his readiness for @entity155 in july			2
he loves the @entity156 almost as much as he loves @entity14			1
it brings the best out of him – and @entity5 's best may still be good enough , somewhere , some day			1
he was blown away here – they all were – by a 21 - year - old @entity161 who has rewritten the record books			2
by the time @entity5 and @entity9 stood on the tee at 2.30pm local time , @entity99 had spoiled it for just about everyone			1
only two men – @entity168 and @entity169 – were deemed capable of catching him			0
the world finally saw the two biggest names in golf paired in the final round of a major , only for it to be part of a distant undercard			0
maybe that was why sunday 's round fell flat – for @entity5 , not @entity9			1
@entity9 ( left ) celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the eighteenth green as @entity5 looks on @entity9 ( right ) taps @entity5 on the shoulder after the pair shake hands following the end of their round the @entity188 finished fourth and shot 66 to equal the best round of the day			1
once again , inconsistency cost him dear at @entity14			1
he was three over par through the first 27 and with @entity99 scoring so fiercely the @entity192 was gone from there			1
it is @entity5 's record of 18 under par that @entity99 has equalled			1
in the difficult circumstances that preceded this tournament , @entity5 most certainly brought his a game , circa 2015 ; how was he to know he also required a time machine to make it 1997 again and stay in the mix ? what is plain , despite sunday 's disappointment , is that rumours of @entity5 's demise were exaggerated			1
he was diagnosed from afar as having the chipping yips , and there were plenty of amateur physicians declaring his condition at best chronic and at worst incurable			0
@entity169 , however , offered a second opinion			0
speaking at @entity214 , where @entity5 quit after 12 holes to rebuild his short game , he was a rare voice predicting this cautiously positive return			2
' i think @entity5 's going to have the last laugh , ' @entity169 said			1
' i think his short game , historically , is one of the best of all time and when you have n't played it 's the first thing to feel uncomfortable and the quickest thing to get back			2
i do n't think he 's going to have any problems			2
we have all had stretches where we do n't hit it solid and usually it 's just a small tweak			2
it 's such a short swing that it 's not a hard thing to fix			2
i do n't see that lasting more than a week or two			0
' last year 's champion @entity234 ( left ) presents winner @entity99 with the green jacket at @entity14 @entity5 reacts after missing a birdie putt on the twelfth hole on sunday afternoon @entity5 hits from the edge of the pine by the tenth hole as the large crowds behind him watch on it took a little longer than that – with considerably harder graft – but considering some feared we had seen the last of @entity5 , this was a tentative return to form			1
if there was a turning point , it came at the 11th on day one , when he missed the green right and saved par with a quite fabulous chip			2
anyone who had the chipping yips , it was said , would still be there now , trying to get up and down			0
@entity102 would have known the world was watching his every tic , too			2
his golf has not been without flaws since , not least his driving , but his short game was a weapon around @entity14 , as it once was			2
there had been a practice round earlier in the week in which @entity5 was rumoured to have outplayed @entity99 down the back nine			1
there was no sign of that individual superiority over the ensuing four days – 19 shots between them and @entity99 leading wire to wire – but this was never about @entity102 winning at @entity14			1
this was about him being back in the game , holding his end up , about him looking like he was enjoying golf , and life , and there was certainly evidence of that			0
he will probably need to work sun up to sun down again , and to win a minor , before he can land a major , but would anyone bet against it given the sight of him walking @entity14 on sunday in the company of the world no 1 ? ready to play some golf ? one day @entity5 may face down @entity9 and it will matter			1
and maybe even one day soon .			0

@entity5 finishes tied for *seventeenth* in the 2015 masters at @entity14
@entity102 could only score *73* on sunday , seven shots less than @entity9
there has been enough to suggest that @entity5 is not finished yet
@entity99 won this year 's masters after finishing on 18 under par
