by @entity0 astronomers are expecting a new meteor shower to light up the sky above @entity4 tonight			1
no one has seen it before , but the shower could put on a show that would rival the prolific @entity10 meteor shower in august			1
the @entity12 shower would be dust resulting from a periodic comet , @entity14			1
@entity19 was discovered in february 2004 by the @entity21 project , a cooperative effort of @entity23 , the @entity24 @entity25 , and the @entity26			0
it is a relatively dim comet that dips inside the orbit of @entity29 once every five years as it loops around the sun. while orbiting , the closest it comes to the @entity32 is 0.9 @entity33 ( 84 million miles ) and the farthest it gets from the @entity32 is about 5 @entity33 ( 465 million miles ) , close to @entity36 ’s orbit			1
this year , @entity37 will have a close approach to @entity29 on may 29			0
it will come within a distance of 0.04 @entity33 , about 3.7 million miles , of our planet			0
if the comet was actively producing a lot of dust during that time , the @entity29 may be treated to a new meteor shower , tentatively named the @entity12			1
' some forecasters have predicted a meteor storm of more than 200 meteors per hour , ” said @entity50 , lead for @entity23 ’s @entity52			1
' we have no idea what the comet was doing in the 1800s			2
the parent comet does n’t appear to be very active now , so there could be a great show , or there could be little activity			2
' @entity23 scientists at @entity64 expect the shower to be active between 02:30 and 11:00 utc on may 24 ( that ’s 10:30 p.m. on may 23 to 7:00 a.m. on may 24 edt ) , and to peak between 06:00 and 08:00 utc on may 24 ( 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. edt )			2
the may @entity67 radiant is in the constellation @entity69 , which translates to ' camel leopard ' or giraffe @entity23 says @entity4 has a pretty good seat for this cosmic event - if there are no clouds			0
it advises : ' find a safe , dark location and lay out beneath the stars			0
' you do n’t need to look in any particular direction , just straight up			0
' @entity81 can appear all over the sky			0
' @entity19 was discovered in february 2004 by the @entity21 project , a cooperative effort of @entity23 , the @entity24 @entity25 , and the @entity26			0
it is a relatively dim comet that dips inside the orbit of @entity29 once every five years as it loops around the sun. two years ago , meteor experts @entity89 of @entity90 and @entity91 at @entity92 announced that @entity29 was due for an encounter with debris from @entity19			1
@entity19 on may 15 , 2014			0
even though the comet will travel close to @entity29 , you won ¿ t be able to see it with the naked eye streams of dust ejected by the comet mainly back in the 1800s would cross @entity29 's orbit on may 24 , 2014			1
the result , they said , could be a significant meteor outburst			2
' we expect these meteors to radiate from a point in @entity69 , also known as ' the giraffe , ' a faint constellation near the @entity107 , ' @entity50 said			0
' it ’s a great opportunity to see a new meteor shower - an opportunity i want to see with my own eyes			1

would rival the prolific @entity10 meteor shower in august
@entity12 shower would be dust resulting from a periodic comet , @entity14
