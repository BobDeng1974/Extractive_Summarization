the two @entity23 were executed by firing squad and the civilians were beheaded in public , the website reported			1
the crime they had committed were joining in the world - wide condemnation of the brutal immolation of the 26 - year - old @entity7 on tuesday			2

' looking for revenge : @entity56 of @entity7 said , quoting @entity57 , ' i 'm not only going to kill him , i 'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down ' gruesome : @entity8 stands inside the cage where he was burned to death , in a frame taken from the video circulated by @entity21 militants yesterday showing the killing of the @entity7 fighter pilot condemnation : responding to @entity71 's murder , the @entity48 of @entity42 , pictured , in @entity49 , @entity48 , said those responsible must face ' killing , crucifixion and chopping of the limbs ' his judgement came as a @entity79 account linked to @entity80 , the @entity81 branch of the terror group , denounced the killing as ' conclusive proof of @entity1 ' deviance '			1
@entity4 clerics widely condemned @entity71 's burning , saying such a form of killing was considered despicable by @entity43 , no matter the context the 1,000 - year - old @entity42 , which is revered by @entity43 around the world , issued a statement expressing ' deep anger over the lowly terrorist act ' by what it called a ' @entity97 ' group			1
grand sheikh @entity48 said the act ' requires the punishment mentioned in the @entity101 for these corrupt oppressors who fight against @entity104 and his prophet : killing , crucifixion or chopping of the limbs			1
' in @entity113 , the @entity108 , headed by prominent cleric @entity109 and linked to the @entity110 that has influence across the region , called the burning of @entity8 a criminal act			0
' @entity117 asserts that this extremist organisation does not represent @entity43 in any way and its actions always harm @entity43 , ' it said			1
@entity122 cleric @entity121 wrote on his @entity79 account : ' burning is an abominable crime rejected by @entity127 law regardless of its causes			0
' ' it is rejected whether it falls on an individual or a group or a people			0
only @entity104 tortures by fire , ' he added			0
barbaric : an @entity1 extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26 - year - old stands clean cut : @entity7 officials have told the devastated family of the 26 - year - old ( pictured ) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a ' hero ' in his homeland was dead in reply , @entity21 posted its own religious edict on @entity79 , which ruled that it is permissible in @entity43 to burn an infidel to death			1
however , senior clerics across the @entity127 world argued that inflicting death by fire was always banned under @entity43			1
' @entity162 , peace be upon him , advised against burning people with fire , ' @entity159 , head of the religious affairs department in southern @entity81 , told @entity165 in @entity166			0
born as an offshoot of @entity80 , @entity21 was cast out of the international terror network last year in response to its brutality			2
@entity171 , @entity172 's chief , last february issued a statement dissociating his group from @entity21 , which it accused of ' forbidden bloodshed ' directed at fellow fighters			1
he said : ' we were n't informed about its creation , nor counselled			0
nor are we satisfied with it : rather we ordered it to stop ... nor is al â€“ @entity80 responsible for its actions and behaviour			0
' @entity21 is the successor of the @entity172 affiliate set up in @entity20 in 2004 by @entity188 to attack @entity190 occupation forces and @entity192 targets			2
@entity188 was , in fact , reprimanded for his sectarian violence by @entity195 and @entity171 , who feared @entity4 opinion would be alienated from @entity172 - advice that @entity188 ignored			0
after @entity188 was killed in 2006 , his successor , @entity198 , set up the @entity21 in @entity20 ( @entity199 ) and continued his mentor 's legacy of violence			1
it reemerged in 2011 as a jihadi fighting force in the civil war in @entity11 , now re-named as @entity1 , and earned a reputation for its rampant and gruesome violence , including beheadings and amputations			2
since then it has overrun vast swathes of both @entity20 and @entity11 , massacring those it deems ' infidels ' and controlling local @entity43 populations with its brutal interpretation of @entity214 law			2
and even @entity4 leaders sympathetic to the jihadist cause said the act of burning a man alive and filming the killing would damage @entity21 , which controls swathes of @entity11 and @entity20			1
@entity221 , a @entity7 @entity223 cleric who spent almost ten years in @entity7 prisons for militant activity , including a plot to attack @entity190 troops , said : ' this weakens the popularity of @entity21 because we look at @entity43 as a religion of mercy and tolerance			1
even in the heat of battle , a prisoner of war is given good treatment			0
' ' even if the @entity21 says @entity239 had bombed and burned and killed us , and we punished him in the way he did to us , we say , ok but why film the video in this shocking way ? ' @entity237 said ' this method has turned society against them			1
' @entity246 , a @entity190 - based monitoring service , quoted @entity248 , whom it described as a @entity122 jihadi , as saying on @entity79 it would have been better if @entity71 's captors had swapped him for ' @entity4 captives '			2
the killing would make ordinary people sympathetic to @entity8 , he said			0
of course , admirers of @entity21 cheered the killing			0
in a @entity79 message , a user called @entity257 said : ' to any pilot participating in the crusader coalition against the holy warriors - know that your plane might fall in the next mission			0
sleep well ! ' many ordinary people across the @entity266 expressed disgust			0
' this a criminal , barbaric act which has no place in @entity43 or humanity			2
@entity43 bears no responsibility for them and their claim to be an @entity21 is ridiculous , ' said @entity273 , 43 , an engineer from @entity274 in the @entity275			1
' there should be a joint @entity278 force to go in and destroy these killers and be rid of them once and for all , ' he added			0
' i have never heard of any group that claims to be @entity4 and commits such atrocities , ' said @entity283 , a 22 - year - old university student in @entity284 , @entity81 's capital			2
the video circulated yesterday , titled ' healing the @entity286 ' , shows @entity71 in an orange jumpsuit doused in fuel , before militants set light to a trail of petrol leading up to the cage where he is held			0
flames quickly engulf the helpless pilot - images that are far too distressing to publish			0
extremists then pour debris , including broken masonry , over the cage , before it is flattened by a bulldozer .			0
