hero : @entity1 survived 63 bombing missions in the @entity3 and helped plan the @entity5 raid the secret history of a decorated @entity8 hero who survived 63 missions , bombed @entity11 's barges and planned the @entity5 raid has been uncovered after his death			1
@entity1 was awarded three top medals for his heroic and brave service during the @entity3 , but lived a humble life after he left the @entity16 and rarely spoke of his incredible achievements			1
he died aged 83 in 2000 , only for an unpublished memoir recording his feats to be unearthed by his family in his home in the @entity22 , @entity23			1
now his story has been told in a biography - titled group captain @entity25 - written by family friend @entity26			0
mr @entity26 and the family of mr @entity1 discovered that the airman 's first mission took place mere hours after war against @entity32 was declared on september 3 , 1939			1
the mission was one of the first bombing missions of the war and involved searching for @entity38 warships in the @entity39			1
another mission described in the memoir described mr @entity1 flying a twin - engined @entity43 bomber on a raid on a canal lock in @entity46 , @entity32 , on august 12 , 1940 , when his plane was hit			1
he recalled later : ' " @entity48 " my navigator said , " i have been hit in the bottom and am bleeding - what shall i do ? " ' " sit on it " , i said , " until we 're out of this "			0
and sit on it he did without a murmur of complaint ... ' squadron leader @entity1 was mentioned in despatches and is aid to have been recommended for a @entity61			1
he might have been given that highest award for valour if another person on the operation had not got the @entity61			1
' there seems to have been a rule of one per op , ' mr @entity26 wrote			2
he went on to become one of the most decorated pilots of the early years of the conflict in the desperate days when @entity72 seemed certain to be invaded and then defeated			0
his second war career came in planning bombing missions as @entity72 and its allies gradually gained the upper hand			1
later he would plan the pinpoint missions to stop the @entity38 ' revolutionary rocket weapons that @entity1 feared might swing the conflict back in the @entity80 ' favour			1
bomber : the brave airman 's first mission took place mere hours after war against @entity32 was declared after being presented with three medals for his service as a courageous bomber , mr @entity1 ( standing second from left ) was transferred into a crack team of specialist mission planners seven days after the @entity46 raid , mr @entity1 was awarded the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , jointly for that mission and an attack on oil tanks in @entity97			1
little more than a week after that award he suffered severe concussion and was lucky to survive when his bomber crashed on landing			0
his close friend @entity61 - one of the most famous airmen of the war - noted sadly that by late 1940 most of the original comrades of @entity107 were dead , missing , prisoners of war or wounded			1
in 1941 , after a six - month convalescence , he was transferred to @entity110 and later that year was awarded a bar to his @entity93 - the equivalent of a second medal			2
in march 1942 he was put in command of @entity115 flying the newly - introduced four - engined @entity116 , and took part in the first 1,000 - bomber raid on @entity119 on may 30 , 1942			0
he was awarded the @entity120 after his last raid on a @entity38 engine factory in @entity123 in august 1942			2
he recounted how he would stand the bomber ' almost on its nose and dive furiously towards the earth , when i thought that the anti-aircraft ( guns ) had the measure of me - a bit nerve - racking for the rest of the aircrew , but an effective measure of evasion to which i consider i owe my life on more than one occasion '			0
mr @entity1 stopped flying because the @entity139 needed an experienced bomber officer to join a crack team of specialist mission planners , where he stayed until the end of the war			1
mr @entity1 was given the @entity93 , was awarded a bar to it and was also given the @entity120 , among a host of other medals writing shortly after the war ended , mr @entity1 said : ' it is difficult to imagine that adventure can be found in the @entity139 , surely the excitement and glory of @entity3 is on the @entity153 ? ' i suppose it could be said i had my fair share of adventure during the four years i was on operations in @entity8			1
' i refrain from writing about these adventures because they were in no way different from those experienced by so many airmen of that gallant command , and further so many books have been written by real heroes , and my personal friends , such as @entity61 and @entity169 , both of whom are household names today			2
' mr @entity1 died in 2000 aged 83 , with loved ones only realising the extent of his achievements when his memoir was unearthed ' i found my adventure in this war in the @entity139 ...			1
i was in a privileged position to watch the most interesting period of the war in @entity180 during the two most vital years			0
' i had my sense of great thrill and disappointment , and occasionally of achievement , event though such achievements were initially on paper			0
' mr @entity1 's work in the @entity139 was outstanding and vital			1
he liaised with @entity189 , designer of the ' bouncing bomb ' , and with wing commander @entity191 on the @entity192 in which the weapon was successfully used			0
@entity38 reservoirs , hydroelectric schemes , armaments factories and dozens of bridges were destroyed - all in one mission			0
even late in the war , with @entity201 troops closing in on victory in @entity180 , mr @entity1 and his team were doing vital work targeting and attacking the factories making and supplying the ' v ' weapons that were wreaking havoc in @entity72			1
the @entity209 and @entity210 missiles caused terror among civilians in @entity213 - and even struck fear into mr @entity1			1
' i was n't aware until reading his memoir , and other reading around it , that they were worried that the missiles would carry some sort of nuclear warhead or biological agent , ' mr @entity26 said			2
. after peace in 1945 , @entity1 served in @entity223 , @entity224 and the @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227			2
after leaving the military , @entity1 worked as a land agent and after retiring from paid work devoted time to helping the children 's charity @entity231			1
he was fully retired and living in the @entity22 when mr @entity26 got to know him			0
' he did not indulge very much in reminiscing , ' the family friend said			0
' his relations rather looked up to him			0
i had a feeling there was something special about him but i was not bold enough to ask him			0
' ' he was very genial , very sympathetic , a benign presence			0
' @entity240 's role during @entity3 was to bomb the enemy 's airbases , shipping , troops , communications and other industries connected to the @entity38 war effort			2
@entity72 had to use long - range bombing after @entity249 in 1940 until d - day in 1944 as it had no other way of attacking the @entity38			0
the job fell to @entity16 air crews - some of who were just 18 - who flew increasingly heavier types of long - range bombers			2
it was so successful that @entity11 was forced to divert nearly a million men , 55,000 artillery guns and a large part of the @entity38 air force on to defending the nation instead of fighting offensively			0
@entity8 flew almost every day and mostly at night during the war to avoid being shot down - but this meant it was difficult to locate small targets			2
in 1941 it was decided whole industrial cities should be priority targets			0
larger four - engine bombers and improved navigation equipment then followed to create a formidable fighting force			0
the repeated and persistent attacks on @entity38 cities which followed became a critical factor in the liberation of @entity180 and the defeat of @entity32 in 1945 .			0

@entity8 hero @entity1 survived 63 dangerous @entity3 missions
he was awarded three top medals and was considered for a @entity61
later joined mission planning team and helped organise @entity5 raid
after leaving @entity16 , mr @entity1 lived a humble life and rarely spoke of service
loved ones learned extent of his bravery after finding memoir when he died in 2000 , aged 83
