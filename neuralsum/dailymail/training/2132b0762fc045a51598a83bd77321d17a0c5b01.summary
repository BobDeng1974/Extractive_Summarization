by @entity0 for the @entity1 new laws designed to control invasive species such as grey squirrels and @entity7 knotweed could end up harming @entity9 wildlife , experts have warned			1
the government has proposed a series of laws which could compel landowners to take action to stop the spread of non-native species			2
but experts led by the @entity17 have warned the new rules , which are proposed to be included in the @entity19 , are so badly written that they could hit projects to reintroduce extinct or struggling species such as beavers , cranes , rare bumblebees and uncommon butterflies			1
the new rules are intended to stop the spread of invasive species such as this grey squirrel in open letter published last night in the journal nature , 24 scientists warned that the laws could lead to an ‘ irreversible loss ’ of wildlife			1
the @entity35 defines non-native species as those that are ‘ not ordinarily resident in , or a regular visitor to , @entity39 ’			2
the experts warned that the definition covered species that had been native to @entity39 but had become extinct and wildlife that could go on to naturally establish itself in this country			1
bizarrely , the @entity46 would also limit conservation actions for species such as barn owls and red kites , which are listed in a 30 - year - old document drawn up prevent breeding of certain species without a licence – which conservationists was created for a completely different purpose			1
the experts ’ letter said : ‘ the current definition has serious implications for wildlife management			2
‘ once a species is classified as non-native , it can also be classified as invasive - and would therefore be subject to invasive - species legislation			1
‘ if the @entity46 is passed in its present form , it could lead to an irreversible loss of native biodiversity			0
’ @entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity71 , said last night : ‘ the government is absolutely right that non-native species pose an extreme threat to our economy and wildlife			2
‘ but as it ’s currently drafted the @entity35 wrongly defines some species such as the red kite or barn owl as non-native			2
this is surely not the government ’s intention			0
‘ there have been many great projects involving species which have been lost from the @entity9 , such as the short - haired bumble - bee , crane , large blue butterfly and white - tailed eagle - it would be perverse to define any of these species as non-native			1
‘ the current drafting could stand in the way of reintroduction projects involving these species and , in extreme cases , even some native could be removed			0
we trust the @entity46 will be more tightly drafted to allow genuinely native species to thrive			0
@entity70 of the @entity71 , pictured , said the new legislation as drafted could threaten the future of species such as red kite and barn own which are deemed to be non-native @entity107 chief executive dr @entity106 said : ‘ legislation on non-natives needs to be carefully drafted so that it does not impact on the conservation of species across their former and future geographic ranges			1
’ he said many species of butterflies and moths were arriving naturally from continental @entity116 in response to climate change and should be welcomed as additions to @entity9 wildlife			1
‘ most of them are benign and will be losing their range further south so this shift will allow them to maintain their distribution range			0
‘ a very small number of species may become pests but these will have to be judged on their own merits			0
‘ in contrast , the introduction of non-native species from outside of @entity116 are likely to pose much bigger risks and should be the focus of attention			0
’ officials , however , insisted the new laws would not be used when it was illogical to do so			0
a government spokesman said : ‘ we want to use these control orders as a last resort to protect our wildlife and economy from invasive non-native species			0
they will not be used for species that are the subject of a legitimate reintroduction programme			0

experts want to counter the menace posed by grey squirrels
but the new legislation could threaten species such as red kites and owls
the legislation could threaten plans to re-introduce species lost to the @entity9
officials claimed the legislation will not *undermine* threatened species
