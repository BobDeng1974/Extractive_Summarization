the scandal shaking @entity2 's ruling @entity1 was triggered by claims the wife of one ambitious candidate was involved in the death of a @entity8 businessman			2
@entity9 , 41 , died in @entity10 last november from excess alcohol , according to initial reports by @entity2 officials			1
but a senior police chief has since cast doubt on the cause of death after claiming the father - of - two may have been poisoned			1
suspicious death ? @entity22 ( left ) , the wife of fallen @entity2 city leader @entity21 , has been accused of playing a part in the death of @entity8 businessman @entity9 ( right ) , who had close links to the family countless rumours and speculation , fuelled by @entity2 online whistleblowers , suggest his death was linked to his professional relationship with @entity21 , the now - purged leader of the city of @entity10			1
in startling new claims , the city 's former police chief @entity34 told @entity21 he believed his wife , @entity22 , was involved in mr @entity9 's death in the southwest @entity2 city , according to a @entity41 source			1
it has also been alleged that a new report reveals how mr @entity9 told friends he feared for his safety after falling out with @entity22 , according to the @entity46			1
claims that she may have been behind his death are the first direct account of events which eventually led to last month 's downfall of @entity21 , who had very publicly bid for a place in the party 's inner circle later this year			2
purged : allegations that the wife of @entity10 leader @entity21 ( above ) may have been behind mr @entity9 's death given an insight into events that forced him from office a source , citing accounts coming from an unfinished central investigation , said it was unclear how much truth there was to the claim by @entity34			1
but he said had ' no doubt ' that @entity34 had raised it with @entity21			2
the account helps explain the apparent rupture between the city chief and @entity34 , who led @entity21 's widely applauded crackdown on crime in @entity2 's most populous metropolis			1
in early february , @entity34 briefly sought refuge in the @entity77 consulate in @entity78 , several hours ' drive from @entity10 , which suddenly made the growing scandal public			0
@entity21 , 62 , and his wife have disappeared from public view since his abrupt removal on march 15 as party chief of @entity10			1
@entity22 is believed to be under arrest , according to @entity86			0
they can not respond publicly to the rumours and reports , nor can @entity34 , who is under investigation			0
the @entity10 government has not answered repeated phone calls and faxed questions from @entity41 about the circumstances of @entity21 's downfall and @entity9 's death			1
power : @entity2 paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the @entity1 provincial head office in @entity10 which was the office of @entity21 the central government has said the results of its investigation into @entity34 's flight to the consulate will be released , but to date it has not offered a detailed account			1
the @entity108 has also not answered questions about @entity9 , with a spokesman saying that he had no information			0
in a news conference days before his dismissal , @entity21 scorned as nonsense unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said some people were pouring ' filth on my family '			2
@entity22 was formerly a high - powered lawyer			2
' @entity34 has told central investigators that @entity22 turned on the @entity8 man because of economic interests and that she wanted to destroy him ( @entity9 ) , ' said the source , who is generally sympathetic to @entity21			1
@entity126 and @entity127 - based relatives of @entity9 told @entity41 in separate interviews that they did not suspect foul play in his death			2
they both spoke on condition of anonymity			0
favours : mr @entity9 is said to have helped the @entity135 ' secure top @entity8 public school berths for their son , @entity136 , centre access : mr @entity21 's son @entity140 , seen here on the right with action movie star @entity143 , left , won places at @entity145 and @entity146 ' it 's preposterous			1
the more description ( in the media ) , the darker it becomes , ' the family member said , occasionally breaking into tears in an interview in the lobby lounge of a hotel on the outskirts of @entity126 late on thursday			0
the family denied reports that @entity9 was a spy and that he was cremated against their wishes			0
' we requested the cremation			0
we were not forced to do so			0
we have no doubts about the police report , ' said one family member			0
dismissed @entity10 party chief @entity21 had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among @entity2 's elite			1
but now a very different picture of his mafia - busting initiative — called da hei , or smash black — is emerging , since mr. @entity21 was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief @entity34			1
critics called his clampdown , launched in 2009 , the ' red terror ' , saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity : framing victims , extracting confessions through torture , extorting business empires and visiting retribution on mr @entity21 's political rivals			1
@entity186 , an analyst of the @entity2 leadership at the @entity188 , told the @entity189 : ‘ even by @entity1 standards , this is unacceptable			0
’ he added : ‘ this is red terror			0
’ in 10 months , 4,781 people were arrested , including business executives , police officers , judges , legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates , according to the @entity189			0
@entity10 ’s top justice official was even found to have buried $ 3 million under a fish pond , during the crackdown			0
he became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed			0
but mr @entity21 's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer , police chief @entity34 last month sought refuge in a @entity77 consulate			1
he apparently feared for his safety after telling mr @entity21 that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a @entity8 citizen , @entity9 , who was an acquaintance of mr @entity21 ’s family			1
the @entity214 in @entity126 has asked the @entity2 government to reinvestigate his death , attributed by @entity10 police to cardiac arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol			2
@entity9 married @entity2 national @entity221 after moving to the country and they had two children , @entity225 , 11 , and son @entity226 , 7			0
he was not a heavy drinker , but was a chain smoker			0
his father , @entity226 , also died of a heart attack after drinks over dinner at his @entity127 home in 2004 at age 63 , the family members said			0
it is understood mr @entity9 helped arrange business meetings with mr @entity21 when he was a government minister in the @entity238 in the capital , @entity126			1
it is also claimed mr @entity9 helped the @entity135 secure top @entity8 public school berths for their son , @entity136 , who studied at @entity145 and @entity146 , though this can not be confirmed			1
the source said that according to @entity34 , @entity22 believed @entity9 had abused or taken @entity21 family funds to which the @entity246 might have had access			1
@entity9 's family members said he had no business dealings with the @entity135			2
the source 's account of @entity34 's accusations tallies with details that have emerged about the drama that unfolded before he took flight to the @entity77 consulate in @entity78 , where he stayed for 24 hours before officials coaxed him out			0
the emerging accounts help explain why central leaders decided to risk the aftershocks triggered by unseating @entity21 , an ex-commerce minister known both for revolutionary style populism and for his courting of multinationals			0
by the time @entity34 arrived at the @entity77 consulate , his relationship with his long - time patron , @entity21 , had already curdled into mutual distrust , said the source			2
according to the source and previous accounts reported by @entity41 , @entity34 feared that @entity21 , eager to preserve his reputation and chances for a spot in the next central leadership , could turn on him after central party investigators began probing @entity34 's past			2
about a week before his flight to the consulate , @entity34 told @entity21 about his suspicions about the death of @entity9 , a business consultant who was instrumental in @entity21 's son attending @entity145 , an exclusive private school in @entity282			1
@entity9 knew the @entity21 family from the time when he lived in @entity2 's northeastern port city of @entity286 , where @entity21 was mayor from 1993 to 2000			2
' ( @entity34 ) told @entity21 that the problem could n't be covered up , ' said the source			2
@entity21 was outraged , said the source , who has met both men			0
days later , @entity21 demoted @entity34 to the much less powerful role of vice mayor for education , culture and science			0
@entity21 initially tried to muffle the allegations , but the former police chief 's flight to the consulate brought the rupture between the men into the open , said the source			1
even if @entity34 's suspicions over @entity9 's death prove unfounded , @entity21 's initial failure to report the case could end his political career , said the source			1
' in the central leadership 's view , that was too late			0
they said he should have reported the problem as soon as @entity34 raised allegations about @entity22			0

officials initially said fixer @entity9 died of excess alcohol
but police chief now fears that @entity323 schoolboy was poisoned
mr @entity9 had close ties to purged @entity10 leader @entity21
told friends he feared for his safety after fall - out with @entity21 's wife , @entity22
