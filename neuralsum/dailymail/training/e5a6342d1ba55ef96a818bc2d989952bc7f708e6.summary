it is supposed to be as blockbuster as they come			2
@entity2 and @entity3 - with all of their individual records , global fame and last six @entity7 between them - do battle in @entity10 's most iconic venues			1
the trouble is , @entity12 did n't feel as if it was the preface scene to one of the great modern day rivalries in world football			1
those in front of the cameras on monday trotted out the party lines that yes , it was their man who deserved to clinch this year 's @entity24 , and no , their opinions were n't for changing			2
@entity2 and his team - mates showed off their skills during a brief training session on monday night @entity2 has won two @entity30 , while @entity3 has been given the award on four occassions on tuesday the home of @entity34 holds a fixture which ought to capture the imagination but feels as if - for the two respective camps , anyway - that the playground debate as to who 's more complete is undermining what is a showpiece in its own right			1
there have been various projections as to how many will flock to the @entity45 , but the club are hopeful of as many as 50,000			2
they had sold around 30,000 at the close of play on monday with tickets available on the gate			0
if those close to the story are bored to tears of talking , there remains a healthy appetite from the paying public to watch them pit their wits against each other internationally			0
even if they represent an unwanted distraction to two teams who need performances , it is an evening you will not be able to take away from the thousands of schoolchildren who want to catch a glimpse of their heroes			0
some waited patiently outside the @entity74 before @entity2 trained in a bobble hat			1
any chance they can get for a quick peak			0
the @entity78 has a kick about on the famous ground where he made his name @entity83 captain @entity3 will hope to show on tuesday night that he is still on a level with @entity2 the 29 - year - old is back for the first time since knocking @entity34 out of the @entity87 in 2013 and this brings the relative merits of both superstars into sharp focus			1
not wholly unsurprising then that when met with the words @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity91 bore a look of acceptance with a wry smile			1
@entity96 asserts the latter should claw back the game 's glitziest individual prize			2
@entity101 's @entity100 disagrees , with both managers voting for their men with all the predictability of a politician at his local polling station come election thursday			0
' they are both genius , ' @entity100 said			0
it was the closest we came to any sort of hyperbole			0
whether towing the party line or not , those within the @entity116 camp are vehement in proclaiming their galactico will get his hands on the golden trophy again in january			0
for @entity2 , that 'll mean two on the spin and a third overall			1
@entity2 's record this season is exceptional , and he will want to continue his scoring on his former ground @entity91 , now 36 and back in the international fold after missing out on the @entity131 after being put out to pasture by ex-manager @entity133 , said : ' i think @entity2 is the best [ in the world ]			1
' it is normal to speak about @entity2 and @entity3 but it is @entity83 versus @entity101			1
for us @entity116 , everyone is expecting that @entity2 can win the third @entity24			1
' there is no reason to suggest @entity91 is anything but spot on			0
@entity2 broke the record for number of goals scored in a single @entity87 season and dragged @entity147 's real to that title kicking and screaming			2
he has recently been recognised as the best in @entity150 and - @entity91 believes - is ' almost perfect ' , whereas the decision to hand @entity3 the @entity153 award in @entity154 was one to raise more than a few eyebrows			1
former @entity156 and @entity157 defender @entity91 backed his international team - mate to retain the award @entity2 was in fine form again this weekend , scoring the only goal in a win over @entity162 ' @entity2 always wants more , even in training , ' @entity91 added			1
' maybe next he can break his own records			0
' while the former @entity156 defender offered some flesh on the bones , @entity96 was at his most pragmatic			0
' i can not separate sentiment from my objective decision , ' he said , somewhat rehearsed			0
' whatever season @entity3 had on footballing grounds , i would still vote for him			2
' they want to get in and out with minimal fuss			0
if it 's anything like @entity3 's trip to @entity177 last week , marked with the constant flash of cameras , they wo n't be allowed to slip away unnoticed .			2

@entity2 and @entity3 meet in *friendly* at @entity12
the build - up to the game has mostly been a *question* of ' who is the best ? '
free - scoring @entity2 was recently named the best in player in @entity150
