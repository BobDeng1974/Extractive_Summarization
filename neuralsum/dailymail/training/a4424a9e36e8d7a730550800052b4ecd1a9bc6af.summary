supermarkets are selling bottled tap water to millions of unsuspecting customers			1
bottles of @entity4 ‘ @entity5 ’ and @entity6 ‘ @entity12 ’ are sitting on shelves alongside big brands of mineral water such as @entity10 and @entity11			1
however , there is no explanation on the label of these supermarket brands that the contents are simply tap water			1
display : @entity6 's @entity20 next to other , more well - known , mineral waters on the face of it , the supermarket water , which costs 17p for a two - litre bottle , offers remarkable value compared with the big brands			1
in reality it is no more than a filtered version of the mains water that comes out of the tap at a cost of just a third of a penny a litre			1
this means the supermarkets and their suppliers are enjoying a mark - up of around 2,500 per cent for filtering the water – something the mains suppliers say is unnecessary			1
they then put it into plastic bottles and ship it to thousands of stores across the country			0
it echoes one of the best - loved episodes of the @entity53 ’s @entity52 , featuring @entity54 as the entrepreneurial @entity55 , of @entity52			0
in pursuit of his millionaire dreams , @entity55 came up with the idea of bottling tap water and selling it as the exclusive ‘ @entity60 ’			2
just as @entity55 failed to mention the tap water origins of @entity60 , so @entity4 and @entity6 have left this important detail off their labels			1
@entity4 sells the filtered mains water under the name of @entity66 which can be bought in a two - litre bottle for 17p or six 500ml bottles for £ 1			1
on the label it says ‘ just water , nothing added ’			0
there is a carbonated version which also sells for 17p			0
sneaky ? @entity6 has attempted to defend its selling of what is essentially tap water in bottles @entity80 connection ? a @entity4 representative said that its bottled water originated from @entity80 - but just what is the truth ? @entity6 ’s product is sold as @entity87 at 17p for two litres or 88p for a pack of six 330ml bottles			1
the prices look cheap compared with the 88p for a two - litre bottle of @entity93 , 69p for @entity94 , or £ 1 for a 750ml bottle of @entity11			0
the trade body for the nation ’s mains water suppliers , @entity99 , insists the product coming out of the taps is cheap , healthy and safe , with absolutely no reason to filter it			0
according to the latest report from the @entity105 , 99.96 per cent of all samples are within health and safety standards			0
@entity107 , of @entity99 , said : ‘ @entity109 tap water is incredibly safe			1
‘ we really are a gold standard in terms of water quality			0
in terms of health and safety there is no need to filter mains water			0
‘ the idea of selling filtered tap water in supermarkets has a whiff of @entity55 and @entity60 about it			1
i can see it would be a nice money - making wheeze			0
’ when asked about the origins of its value water , a @entity4 spokesman initially offered a completely inaccurate explanation			2
she said : ‘ my understanding from speaking to our water buyer is that it originates from a spring in @entity80			2
’ asked whether it was filtered mains tap water , she said : ‘ no , absolutely not			1
no , its origin is @entity80 , but it is bottled in the @entity109 – i think somewhere in the @entity139			2
‘ the bottle does n’t pretend to be anything other than it is			0
it is categorically not water from a tap and put into a bottle			0
’ remember this ? the revelations echo the famous @entity52 storyline where @entity55 and @entity149 tried to pass off tap water as ' @entity60 ' later , the company confirmed that the water comes from the @entity109 mains and has been filtered to remove chlorine and what it said were ‘ other impurities ’ found in tap water			1
@entity4 claimed that while the water originated from the mains , the fact it is then filtered means it is unfair to describe it as tap water			1
it said : ‘ @entity164 comes from @entity109 sources and is filtered to improve the taste and remove impurities			2
@entity4 sells a wide range of waters to suit all tastes and budgets			0
‘ all of our products are clearly labelled so customers know what they ’re buying			0
’ @entity6 confirmed that its @entity87 water is filtered mains water			1
its manufacturer gets its supplies from the tap water firm @entity180 before filtering and bottling it			1
a spokesman argued the water was cheaper than buying a water filter and jug for the home			0
@entity6 said : ‘ our two - litre bottle is 17p			2
for comparison – if a customer bought a @entity191 water filter jug at £ 16 and used it for the recommended 40 gallons , it would cost 21p to produce two litres of filtered water			0
we ’re saving our customers time and money – as well as providing a container			0
’ in 2004 , @entity197 ran into trouble after it began selling the premium bottled water @entity201 , which turned out to be filtered tap water from @entity203 in @entity204			1
@entity205 , of the campaigning ethical food group @entity206 , said : ‘ @entity207 tried it with @entity60 , then @entity197 with @entity201 water , and now @entity4			2
‘ when people are struggling with their grocery bills the last thing they need is to be ripped off by eye - watering mark - ups and misleading labelling			0
‘ i hope people return to trustworthy tap water – saving money , saving energy and saving waste in the process			1
’ the @entity4 and @entity6 still water bottles sit alongside big - name mineral water brands on the shelves			1
at @entity4 , the @entity5 features a ‘ best seller ’ sticker while at @entity6 shoppers are drawn to a promotion sign advertising its 17p low price			2
the @entity4 brand adds the slogan : ‘ just water , nothing added			2
’ @entity6 ’s tells customers it is ‘ good for hydration ’ and its ingredients are ‘ @entity12 ( 100 % ) ’			0
the bottles also sit alongside the supermarkets ’ own brand mineral waters			0
@entity4 ’s @entity242 and @entity6 ’s @entity243 – at 42p and 45p respectively – list their spring source .			2

what appears good value is tap water marked up 2,500 per cent
@entity4 start by saying the water originates from @entity80 - then admit it 's from @entity109 mains
@entity6 admit it is filtered @entity180
@entity256 group sustain believe people are being conned
