@entity0 will trigger the latest saga in @entity3 's colourful career by bidding around £ 76million for the @entity5 striker			1
the @entity9 club , who will complete a deal for @entity7 from @entity6 on thursday , have been bracing themselves for this to begin and have given out clear signals that the player is not for sale			1
the player himself has said that there is nothing to be concerned about because he is happy on @entity20 and the club is going in the right direction			0
waving goodbye ? @entity0 will try to trigger @entity3 's release clause at @entity5 with a £ 76m bid however , even those close to the 27 - year - old admit they ca n't say for sure what his final answer will be if @entity0 keep increasing the mark on their bid			1
last year @entity5 showed admirable resolve to keep their man out of @entity33 's clutches and @entity34 admitted it was his greatest test as a manager to turn around what at one stage seemed an irretrievable stance from @entity3			1
he did it with such aplomb that the @entity42 hugged him in recognition after receiving his @entity44 last month			0
yet @entity0 are a greater proposition than @entity33			2
the prospect of lining up with @entity47 and @entity48 in a stable of @entity50 is bound to appeal and they have the financial clout to make deals happen			1
enticement : the prospect of lining up with @entity47 and @entity48 ( right ) is sure to appeal to @entity3 @entity0 will also offer various makeweights with @entity55 , who has agreed a new contract , and @entity57 already mooted			1
@entity5 will counter that with them he can remain the @entity50 no matter who else they sign but it could be a fretful summer as the opening salvos are fired			2
@entity61 and @entity62 could be re-united soon as @entity63 grow agitated at their forward 's demands for re-assurances			1
@entity67 reported @entity69 's interest in the @entity71 star last month and @entity73 newspaper @entity72 claims an official approach was made two weeks ago for the 24 - year - old			2
@entity76 gave @entity61 his chance at @entity63 when there were calls for new players to be brought in and that has not been forgotten by the player despite his affiliation with his boyhood club			0
friends re-united ? @entity61 and @entity62 could be back together at @entity86 @entity69 have distanced themselves from links with @entity63 and their priority remains to recruit in midfield and defence but with offers coming in for @entity92 and @entity93 , checking on @entity61 's price and availability makes good business sense			1
@entity69 have been offered @entity98 midfielder @entity97 by intermediaries but know @entity0 are keen too on the highly - rated @entity100			0
@entity101 , meanwhile , have rejected a £ 27m offer from @entity103 for @entity69 target @entity104			0
@entity106 are likely to be priced out of a move for @entity108			1
@entity109 do not want to sell and will demand a prohibitive £ 15million if pushed			0
the @entity111 striker scored 25 goals last season and has 52 in 87 games for @entity109 since his £ 8m move from @entity116			0
end of the road : @entity109 have slapped a £ 15m price tag on star striker @entity108 ( right ) the @entity120 club also agreed a 25 per cent sell on clause so they will be keen to see if @entity109 can hold on to their prized asset			1
@entity106 are expecting offers from the likes of @entity125 and @entity126 for @entity127 who is keen to leave despite not handing in an official transfer request while @entity129 are showing an interest in @entity131			0
on thursday they completed the £ 3m transfer of @entity134 from @entity135			0
@entity136 have held further talks over the possibility of signing @entity139			1
the free agent striker who has left @entity143 is holding out for big wages of around £ 100,000 a week and that will limit his options in this country			1
@entity125 are weighing up an offer but have other targets too while @entity150 are waiting on talks with @entity153 's @entity152 and what bids come in for £ 19m - rated @entity155			1
dictating terms : @entity139 ( right ) is a free agent and will want £ 100,000 a week @entity139 is also wanted by @entity157 although they have expressed an interest in @entity159			1
@entity136 have a deal in place for @entity163 's @entity162 but are surprised at @entity165 's valuation of @entity166 , as reported in @entity67 , and have touched base again about @entity169 captain @entity168			2
there were a few well - known faces in the crowd at @entity173 versus @entity174 on wednesday night			0
@entity125 manager @entity175 , @entity177 boss @entity176 and @entity179 sporting director @entity178 were all spotted in the @entity181 crowd			2
@entity126 midfielder @entity182 was particularly impressive and did himself no harm amid illustrious company			0
the 20 - year - old is attracting interest from @entity150 but @entity177 and @entity179 will also be taking note of what he could offer			1
@entity190 midfield prospect @entity189 also did enough in his cameo appearance to have scouts talking			0
impressive : @entity193 ( right ) did himself no harm against @entity173 in front of interested scouts free agent @entity197 has agreed a move to @entity199			1
the 25 - year - old , who can play in defence or midfield , left @entity203 at the end of the season and has had interest from a number of @entity209 clubs but has been attracted to @entity211 's plans at the ambitious @entity213 club			0
he is having a medical today			0
@entity199 have also made an approach for @entity217 striker @entity216 but @entity218 have bid around £ 100,000 also for the 25 - year - old			2
@entity220 are continuing to monitor @entity221 at @entity222			0
they are not alone , however , as @entity190 , @entity224 , @entity69 and @entity33 have also watched his progress since he became @entity229 's youngest @entity228 debutant at the age of 16 years , four months and 25 days last october			0
now 17 , @entity231 have also made enquiries about the midfielder as have @entity98 , which may prompt some bidding for his services			0
keeping watch : many of the @entity240 's big boys have their eye on @entity222 's @entity221 @entity242 have made enquiries for @entity245 striker @entity244			1
the skilful 20 - year - old forward has already been compared to the other diminutive strikers that have come out of @entity245 but wants to make his own name by impressing in the @entity240			2
@entity5 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 have already held tentative talks but the player is keen on working with @entity255			2
@entity256 would cost around £ 6million and has a dual @entity258 passport .			0

@entity0 will test @entity3 's resolve but star says he 's happy at @entity9
striker might be enticed by prospect of playing with @entity48 and @entity47 at the @entity265
@entity55 and @entity57 could be makeweights in @entity3 deal
@entity5 set to complete a deal for @entity6 's @entity7
@entity61 could be *reunited* with @entity62 at @entity86
@entity106 likely to be priced out of @entity108 bid
@entity136 have held further talks with free agent striker @entity139
@entity193 interesting @entity150 , @entity177 and @entity179
@entity197 signs for @entity199 on a free
@entity242 make enquiries for £ 6m @entity245 @entity244
