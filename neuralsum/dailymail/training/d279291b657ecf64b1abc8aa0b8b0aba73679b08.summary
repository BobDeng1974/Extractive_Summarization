@entity0 had originally cooled such speculation by telling the @entity17 that @entity10 's quotes came as a ' complete surprise ' to him			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 has flown out to @entity2 amid reports that businessmen want to buy the club however , speaking at a press conference on monday morning , @entity1 manager @entity23 confirmed @entity0 had now gone to @entity2 for further discussions			1
' i do n't know about selling it but i know he 's away in @entity2 to discuss a proposition from some @entity2 businessmen , ' @entity23 said			1
' what that is , i 've no idea			0
what the ins and outs of it are , i do n't know			0
i 'll know more when @entity0 comes back			2
' things have not being going well at the @entity38 with the club 's debt reaching £ 163.8million @entity1 's debt , which reached a staggering £ 163.8million when the most recent accounts were published in december , has been well - documented , yet @entity10 insists such figures would not stand in his way , with the majority of that deficit owed to owner @entity46			1

but you have guard against who you sell it to			0
' hopefully , @entity46 is not going to sell it to just anybody			0
it 's the same with me ; anyone who walks through the door will get an audience , but having done that it 's about due diligence that they do on the football club and that is done on them			2
