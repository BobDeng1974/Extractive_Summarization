the @entity0 has a quarter of the number of fighter squadrons it did 25 years ago and two - thirds of the active duty airmen , a drop that threatens @entity8 air superiority , defense officials told lawmakers on friday			1
' enough is enough , ' air force secretary @entity11 told lawmakers in the @entity13 as she defended a @entity15 budget request that exceeds federal spending caps			2
' given the state of the world ... the number one thing we have to stop is this downsizing			2
' but members of the defense appropriations subcommittee said president @entity24 's 2016 @entity15 base budget of $ 534 billion exceeded spending caps by nearly $ 35 billion and would have to be cut			0
' the budget he ( @entity24 ) submitted ... frankly is politically ... a fantasy , ' said representative @entity41 of @entity42			0
' it 's not going to pass , and he knows that			0
' @entity41 said he hoped lawmakers ultimately would be able to reach a bipartisan deal to provide some relief from the spending limits			0
until that happens , however , ' we 're going to have to live within the numbers that we have under the law , and sadly , that means we 're going to have to make a lot of tough choices ' about cutting billions from the @entity0 spending request , he said			2

' there were 511,000 active duty airmen during @entity60			1
we have 200,000 fewer today			0
' @entity8 air superiority has also been threatened by the cuts , officials said @entity70 said @entity0 planes had an average age of 27 years , and @entity73 said updating the fleet was imperative			1
