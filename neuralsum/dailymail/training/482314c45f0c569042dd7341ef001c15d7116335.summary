by @entity0 and @entity1 a flyer ordering @entity3 in eastern @entity4 to register with @entity6 forces or face deportation has been branded a fake by religious leaders , including the area 's rabbi			1
pamphlets circulating in @entity13 demanded ' citizens of @entity3 nationality ' over the age of 16 pay $ 50 to register and be issued special passports ' marking the confession of faith '			1
but the flyer , described as ' grotesque ' by @entity22 secretary of state @entity21 , has now been classed by the leader of the city 's @entity3 community as a hoax , aimed at stirring up trouble			1
the leaflet distributed in @entity13 , @entity4 , calling for all jews over 16 - years - old to register or face deportation , sparked concern among the area 's 15,000 - strong @entity3 community			1
now many are looking at fleeing @entity4 for @entity34 a pro-russian activist stands guard in front of the @entity38 in @entity13 this week			1
the @entity39 has denied responsibility for an anti-semitic flyer circulating in the city while the local rabbi has branded it a fake the handouts , a chilling echo of @entity48 persecution , were given to @entity3 leaving a local synagogue by three men in ski masks holding the flag of the @entity53 , @entity34 media reports			1
jews living in the area of the self - declared @entity39 , were ordered to register at a government building operated by @entity6 forces or face the threat of deportation			1
but according to @entity63 , the city 's chief rabbi , @entity61 , told reporters : ' i think it 's someone trying to use the @entity3 community in @entity13 as an instrument in this conflict			1
that 's why we 're upset			0
' the @entity39 , under the leadership of @entity73 , has already denied any involvement in the anti-semitic handout			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity78 , he said : ‘ i strongly deny that this document on registering @entity3 people is genuine			2
‘ i have never written and signed anything like this , nor orders on food coupons , nor taxes for businessmen nor registration for foreign students , all of which have been reported			0
@entity22 secretary of state @entity21 branded the leaflet ' grotesque ' while he was in @entity92 as part of peace talks			1
but the handout may have been a fake aimed at stirring up trouble in the region pro-russian armed soldiers on a tank in eastern @entity4 where a flyer ordering @entity3 to register has added to tensions ‘ those documents are aimed to discredit our people 's republic			1
’ of the order about @entity3 's being forced to register , or lose their rights to property , he insisted : ‘ look at this document			2
i have never called myself the people 's governor , my job is different			0
‘ the stamp is bigger than it should be because it was photoshopped from some real document			0
‘ i am personally strongly against any declarations of this sort made against @entity3 or any other people			2
this is a dirty trick by our foes			0
’ despite the denials , the episode has added to tensions at a time when pro-russian and @entity131 protests have already ended in violence			2
a number of prominent @entity134 came out in support of the pro-european demonstrations in the capital @entity138 but they have not officially endorsed the movement			0
@entity141 has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the @entity3 people			2
in the late 18th century , @entity145 created the @entity146 , which dictated where in @entity141 @entity3 were allowed to reside , an area of about 20 per cent of then - @entity148 which today is part of @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and , notably , @entity4			1
@entity154 also saw a wave of anti-jewish riots , known as pogroms , which took off with the violent persecution in @entity159 in 1821 , now the third largest city in @entity4 , which had one of the highest percentages of @entity3 population in the @entity146			1
decades of pogroms followed , with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-jewish events occurred in the @entity141 , notably in @entity138 , @entity166 and @entity159			0
the trigger was the assassination of @entity141 's @entity169 , for which many blamed ' the jews '			0
between 1903 and 1906 thousands of @entity3 were killed in pogroms , including the 1905 pogrom of @entity159 which saw up to 2,500 @entity3 men , women and children killed , according to historic reports			0
the pogroms , harsh conditions and wide - spread poverty in the @entity146 saw some two million @entity3 emigrate , mainly to the @entity22 in the late 1800s and early 1900s			1
during the @entity180 era , the @entity180 and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting @entity3			0
@entity184 was said by numerous sources to despise @entity3 and under @entity186 , @entity3 faced discrimination			0
' perhaps you got @entity4 confused with @entity141 , where @entity3 organizations have noticed growth in anti-semitic tendencies last year			1
' the leaflet says all people of @entity3 descent over 16 should report to the commissioner for @entity196 in the @entity38 and ' register			2
' it goes on to explain that the reason for this is that leaders of the @entity3 community of @entity4 supported @entity202 in reference to the leader of a nationalist group fighting for independence at the end of the @entity208			2
the letter features the flag of the so - called @entity211 , a self - proclaimed state declared earlier this month by several hundred activists who occupied the @entity214 and the @entity216 buildings in the city			0
' in case of attempts to avoid the registration , the subject persons ’ citizenship will be revoked with their subsequent enforced deportation outside @entity211 including the forfeiture of their property , ' the leaflet adds , before being signed off , ' @entity229 ’s governor – @entity73			0
