by @entity0 though @entity4 rockets fill the skies over @entity6 , residents of cosmopolitan @entity2 have been seen hitting the beach , joyfully plunging into the water when the air raid sirens stop and the coast is clear			1
the threat of violence has hung heavy over the region since the creation of the state in 1948 , and as a result @entity6 have become accustomed to a daily reality that would fill the people of other westernised nations with dread			2
because of its distance from the volatile @entity23 , the coastal city became known as ' the bubble ' , avoiding the security threats faced by @entity6 in other parts of the country			0
the relaxed attitude exhibited by the people of @entity2 may have something to do with the fact that not a single @entity6 has died as a result of the launches - a stark comparison to the estimated 170 @entity37 who have died from @entity62 airstrikes and artillery fire			1
' after a while you almost get used to the sound of the air raid sirens , but not completely , ' @entity64 , who works in a @entity2 women 's accessory store told @entity71			0
she added that she refused to shut up shop and stay at home because it ' would be handing @entity4 a victory and i refuse to do that '			0
wrath : @entity78 fired from the northern @entity23 into @entity6 @entity6 's ' @entity52 ' defence system is activated to shoot down an incoming rocket fired by @entity37 militants , near the city of @entity83 @entity37 militants resumed rocket attacks on @entity2 on monday after a 24 - hour lull in strikes on the @entity6 commercial capital , and @entity6 kept up its air and naval bombardments of the @entity23 despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire			1
the military said it had shot down a drone from @entity23 , the first reported deployment of an unmanned aircraft by @entity37 militants and a possible step up in the sophistication of their arsenal , although it was not clear whether it was armed			0
their rocket attacks have been regularly intercepted but more than half a dozen @entity6 have been wounded since the start of the week - old offensive			0
@entity23 health officials say @entity6 air strikes have killed 170 palestinians , most of them civilians			1
the other side : @entity37 girls mourn at their home before the funeral of their uncle , @entity114 , who died the day before in an @entity6 airstrike @entity37 gather around the remains of a house which police said was destroyed in an @entity6 air strike in @entity120 today the violence was prompted by the murder of three @entity6 teenagers and revenge killing of a @entity37 youth			1
@entity6 officials said on monday three people arrested over the @entity37 's death had confessed to burning him alive			1
@entity130 and @entity131 are seen as potential mediators but peace efforts were complicated by @entity4 's rejection of a mere ' calm for calm ' in which both sides hold their fire in favour of wider conditions including prisoner release and an end to @entity6 's @entity23 blockade			1
the @entity6 army said its aircraft and naval gunboats attacked dozens of targets in the @entity23 and that @entity37 militants fired more than 20 rockets into @entity6 , slightly wounding a boy in the town of @entity83 , where a home was damaged , and two girls , 11 and 13 , near @entity153			1
@entity37 health officials said at least 20 people in @entity23 were wounded			0
but @entity6 did not carry out a threat to step up attacks against rocket - launching sites it said were hidden among civilian homes in the town of @entity161 after urging residents there to leave			2
a @entity165 aid agency said around a quarter of the town 's 70,000 residents had fled			0
@entity2 experienced a rare lull in morning rocket strikes , but they resumed during the evening rush hour , with @entity52 going into action			2
police said there were no casualties or damage			0
@entity4 , the @entity178 group which runs @entity23 , said its armed wing had sent several locally - made drones to carry out ' special missions ' deep inside @entity6			2
a military spokesman said the drone was shot down near the port of @entity83 , about 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of @entity23 , by a @entity187 - built @entity186 missile , used largely ineffectively by @entity6 against @entity189 scud missiles in the @entity190 .			0

@entity6 go about their lives despite the *ongoing* fighting with @entity4
@entity196 residents seen running from beach *laughing* as sirens blare out
@entity52 and other measures have so far stopped any @entity6 deaths
so far @entity6 strikes have killed an estimated 170 @entity37
