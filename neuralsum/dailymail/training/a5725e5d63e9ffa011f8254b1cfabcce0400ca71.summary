one of @entity1 ’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up			1
the allegation was made in the third part of the @entity9 documentary that has exposed serial doping in @entity11 which is being treated by the @entity13 ruling body as a highly serious issue for the sport with investigations into the tv allegations being carried out by the @entity13 ethics committee , anti-doping body @entity18 and the @entity19			1
@entity9 tv station @entity20 have alleged evidence from an unnamed whistleblower in the @entity23 that the alleged cover - up of drugs cheats went far beyond the boundaries of @entity11			1
one of @entity1 ’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up @entity13 vice-president @entity29 said on monday he believes athletics ' reputation is damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries the information about the @entity1 involvement came from @entity20 ’s whistleblower from within the @entity23			1
his evidence alleged that the protection of possible drugs cheats by the @entity13 went far beyond @entity11			1
the list — seen by @entity42 — was compiled between 2006 and 2008 before the advent of blood passports that have greatly helped in the battle to beat the dopers			1
it contains names of @entity11 athletes but also others from @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity9 as well as the @entity1 trio			1
the star @entity1 name was on the highest colour red tier of suspicion for blood counts @entity62 and @entity63 — so should have automatically been target tested for the blood - boosting drug @entity65			1
but @entity20 ’s @entity13 insider says the necessary follow - up tests were not done at that time			2
and if so , very sparingly			2
journalist @entity68 , who made the @entity20 documentary , said : ‘ i trust the source of these documents 100 per cent			2
’ a spokesperson for the @entity1 star was made aware of the exact allegations but was not available for comment			1
@entity77 , the former president of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , has lambasted the @entity13 for not acting on allegations of systematic @entity11 doping the @entity13 claimed that a single blood reading is not definitive and their medical staff would not necessarily know if a target test had taken place			1
a rebuttal statement said : ‘ the blood data collected before ( 2009 ) was used for target purposes to trigger follow up urine tests for @entity65 detection			0
abnormal results were followed up whenever possible			0
one can not draw any conclusion on whether or not an athlete has doped on the basis of one single blood value			0
‘ when they are available , the @entity13 has used pre- 2009 blood values as secondary evidence			0
however these values do not have the same reliability and strength as samples collected under strict conditions			0
‘ the @entity13 has been using the pre- 2009 blood data to identify countries where there was a high risk of doping and to adjust its doping control programme accordingly			2
’ the documentaries have been sent to the @entity13 ’s independent ethics committee who are already investigating other whistleblower evidence of systematic @entity11 doping that was also covered up			1
the @entity13 also have to deal with further allegations about @entity13 president @entity114 ’s son @entity113 , a marketing consultant for the organisation , around @entity117 ’s failed bid to host the 2017 @entity118			0
this comes after @entity120 chief lord @entity29 claimed athletics ' reputation is being disproportionately damaged by doping cases involving a small number of countries			2
@entity29 , an @entity13 vice-president who is standing in next august 's election to be the organisation 's president , called the allegations ' very serious ' and promised any investigation into them will be completely independent			0
' this is not in every country of the world - there are 213 federations , ' he said			0
' but you do have to say a disproportionate amount of the reputational damage is in a relatively small number of countries , and i think we have to recognise this			0
' they are very serious allegations			0
the very fact that the allegations are in the public domain means that they are serious			0
so , we have to be very clear that this is a very , very difficult time for our sport			0
