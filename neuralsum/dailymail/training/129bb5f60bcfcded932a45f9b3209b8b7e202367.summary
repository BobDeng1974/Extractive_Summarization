by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 21 november 2013 senior @entity2 mp @entity1 has been cleared of accusations that he abused his position to help green companies lobby ministers			1
mr @entity1 , who stepped down as chair of the influential @entity10 and @entity9 in june , was reinstated yesterday after an inquiry by the sleaze watchdog			1
the parliamentary standards committee ruled that his actions - exposed by a newspaper sting operation - had broken no rules			2
@entity1 had been clear of claims he abused his position as chairman of the @entity10 energy and climate change committee undercover reporters , posing as representatives of a fake solar technology company , approached mr @entity1 offering a £ 7,000 - a - day consultancy contract with the firm			1
he was filmed saying : ‘ if you want to meet the right people , i can facilitate all those introductions and i use the knowledge i get from what is quite an active network of connections ’			2
asked if that included government minister he said ‘ yes ’			0
@entity37 rules prohibit mps from acting as paid advocates to lobby ministers			0
mr @entity1 was also asked about his committee ’s questioning of @entity43 , managing director of @entity44			1
the mp did not ask him any questions , after declaring he was a paid director and shareholder of @entity48 - its parent company			0
but he was filmed telling the reporters : ‘ i told him [ mr @entity43 ] what to say			0
’ mr @entity1 had stepped down as chairman in june , but was reinstated yesterday the standards committee , which is made up from mps of all parties , concluded he did not expect a financial interest in the company or offer to approach ministers or civil servants on their behalf			1
they said it was the undercover reporters who were guilty of ‘ subterfuge , misrepresentation and selective quotation ’ , and went on : ‘ media investigations can have a role to play in ensuring high standards of public conduct but we note that in this case mr @entity1 has broken no rules and the only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves			1
’ standards commissioner @entity77 found there was no evidence he had coached the business associate but did urge mr @entity81 to ‘ consider more carefully the impact of his comments ’			0
but she did called for a wider review into whether committee chairmen ’s outside interests should be restricted , saying while these positions could help their work on specialist committees , ‘ there is equally a reasonable concern that that member is then placed in a privileged position which he or she may be able to exploit for their own interests with few checks and balances ’			1
mr @entity1 , she said , had made clear he could not be a ‘ public advocate ’ and any ministers would have to judge the merits of the product adding that ‘ the integrity of the system here is pretty high ’			2
a former environment minister under @entity108 , mr @entity1 ’s job as chairman of the committee is to ask tough questions of ministers and firms about @entity116 ’s energy policy			1
