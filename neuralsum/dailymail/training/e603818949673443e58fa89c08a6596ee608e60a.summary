by @entity0 she said she wanted to live a farmer ’s life , and bought the cattle , sheep , pigs , chickens and geese to prove it			2
but it seems @entity10 has finally tired of all that rustic simplicity			2
the actress and model has put her secluded @entity15 farm on the market – and is set to make a £ 3million profit from the sale			0
' darling buds all the way ' : the sale of six - bedroom @entity22 in the @entity15 looks set to make @entity10 a profit of £ 3million @entity26 decor : the stuffed alligator , left , and four - poster bed in the star 's bedroom six - bedroom @entity22 has all the rural charm you would expect from a stone - built farmhouse set in 73 acres of green fields – ‘ @entity36 all the way , ’ says miss @entity10			1
but inside , it has the unmistakeable marks of a celebrity owner			0
there ’s the obligatory @entity42 in a vast @entity44 kitchen and a huge portrait of @entity46 and her 12 - year - old son @entity47 in the lounge			1
but in the bedroom , things start to get odd			0
perching on its hind legs is what appears to be a miniature stuffed alligator seemingly keeping an eye on a nearby four - poster bed			2
the animal theme continues in the sitting room			0
anybody wanting to play the grand piano has a dead tiger to contend with – its mouth wide open , baring its fangs			2
family friendly : the portrait of @entity46 and son @entity47 , left , in the lounge grrreat feature : a tiger skin draped across the grand piano rural idyll : miss @entity10 ( right ) has spoken with affection of the moment she first saw @entity73 , which is surrounded by 73 acres of greenery nearby , a glass coffee table is supported by two topless figures			1
outside is a tennis court and a garden filled with flowers			2
for a woman who is regularly photographed on the red carpet , miss @entity10 naturally has converted one of @entity22 ’s outbuildings into a ‘ party barn ’			1
she has thrown many parties , with guests able to stay in the ‘ guest annexe ’ , a converted @entity15 stone stable block with three ensuite bedrooms and a large sitting room			1
@entity22 , which has six bedrooms in the main house , also has two separate cottages and outbuildings			0
the 31 - acre bluebell wood and 35 acres of farmland are not included , however			0
sculpted : the home includes well - kept gardens , and an outbuilding used for parties annexe : the home includes a separate area in which visitors can stay in privacy approach : miss @entity10 once put the surrounding farmland to good use - then her interest waned distant : miss @entity10 's country paradise began to fade when her ex-husband tired of being far from the city miss @entity10 , 48 , expects the estate – being sold by estate agency @entity114 – to sell for £ 6million			1
she bought it 11 years ago for £ 3.3million as she started dating her ex-husband , textile billionaire @entity10			1
describing the moment she first saw @entity73 , miss @entity10 said : ‘ [ it was ] the most perfect june day , a few months after i ’d given birth to my son , @entity47			1
the moment i stepped over the threshold , i knew i wanted to live here			0
’ for a time , the model embraced the farm life , stocking the estate with four labradors , two cats , three geese , eight chickens , 49 cows , 63 sheep and 82 pigs			0
she even began stocking her own sausages in @entity135			0
unmistakable : miss @entity10 's @entity137 kitchen has the classic celebrity features such as a prominent @entity42 luxury : the bathroom fits the rest of the house 's nuetral decor @entity144 : rooms higher in the house have authentic exposed wooden beams fine dining : the separate dining room has commanding views over the surrounding fields but she gradually outgrew her rural idyll			1
mr @entity10 reportedly disliked living so far from the big city , and her interest in farming waned			0
miss @entity10 said : ‘ i ’ll miss sitting round the fire cackling with my friends , walking through the fields with my son , and the rose garden i created			1
but i ’m taking my memories with me , so i ’ll be ok			0
’ she now lives at @entity163 , a @entity164 mansion in @entity165 she bought with @entity166			0
when their relationship foundered last year , miss @entity10 – who is now dating hedge fund tycoon - turned - wildlife photographer @entity167 - decided to buy mr @entity166 ’s share and stay on .			1
