@entity9 , 58 , said her fellow teachers were racist , copied her @entity12 accent and gossiped about her almost immediately after she started work			1
she told the @entity15 tribunal : ' during this time i was the only @entity3 or black employee at the school			2
as soon as i started working at the school i began to experience hostility towards me			2
@entity9 was off work from @entity21 in @entity22 upon @entity23 , @entity24 , for six years on full pay ' this involved hostile behaviour such as ignoring me , isolating me , whispering behind my back and mimicking my accent			1
this continued throughout the time i was employed at the school			0
' after 14 months off sick with stress , she returned to work where two months later her teaching assistant had an epileptic fit and fell on top of her , pinning her to the floor			2
she claimed to have suffered chest , neck and spine injuries as a result			0
mrs @entity9 , who had worked at @entity21 in @entity22 upon @entity23 , @entity24 , since april 2002 , again went off sick after that alleged accident in november 2003			1

she was on full pay of about £ 30,000 a year until she was suspended last year – and was finally sacked in january 2010			1
the teacher , who is reckoned to have cost the taxpayer a total of £ 300,000 in pay and legal costs over the six years , has taken her education authority to an employment tribunal , claiming victimisation and unfair dismissal			1
@entity55 told the tribunal that mrs @entity9 was fit enough to play badminton and go swimming despite receiving a disability living allowance from the @entity59			1
but mrs @entity9 , who uses a stick , told the hearing that her sporting prowess was a ' misunderstanding ' and she could only walk a maximum of 50metres and was unable to negotiate stairs			1
she insisted she be provided with a high table , special chair and interactive white board before she could return to teach the five - to - seven - year - old pupils			0

mrs @entity9 also claimed she was unable to cope with the slightest changes in routine and quickly became aggressive when challenged			1
to add to her list , she said she suffered from learning problems , panic attacks and a difficulty in filling in forms			0
head mr @entity78 pointed out to the tribunal these were hardly ideal attributes for a teacher			0
he said : ‘ her claims caused a considerable amount of time , money and aggravation for the school and an irreparable breakdown of confidence			2
i could not trust this teacher with children			0
