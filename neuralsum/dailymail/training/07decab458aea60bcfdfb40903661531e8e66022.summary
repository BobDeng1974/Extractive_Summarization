@entity0 admits @entity1 are happy to win ugly as long as it keeps them in touch with @entity6 rivals @entity5			1
last month 's 2 - 0 defeat to the @entity9 outfit has left @entity11 's side with a nine - point gap to bridge if they want to lift the title			1
but while @entity5 were flamboyantly scoring four goals past @entity16 at home , @entity1 stumbled to a joyless 1 - 0 win over @entity19 at @entity20			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity19 @entity0 is congratulated by team - mate @entity22 after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal a drab affair was only enlightened briefly when @entity19 defender @entity26 turned @entity0 ' cross into his own net 13 minutes after half - time			1
it was far from pretty but the @entity30 was just happy not to lose any further ground to the table - topping @entity33 men			2
he told the official @entity1 website : ' the most important thing was getting the win - we ca n't afford to drop any more points			1
' especially at home we want to be winning our games , we had to grind it out and thankfully we did that			2
' the game should have been a lot easier for us and a lot easier for the fans - that would only have come from us taking our chances and making the game ours			2
@entity1 ' @entity52 and @entity19 's @entity54 tussle for the ball ' we should n't have given the opposition as much of a look - in towards the end and we dropped deep and got a wee bit nervy			1
' that is sometimes the natural instinct when you 're defending a 1 - 0 lead but we should n't have been in that position			2
' if you do n't take your second and third chances then it does become difficult for the team and you could sense that			0
' the 29 - year - old came in to replace the injured @entity70 for just his third start of the season			0
his reintroduction was the only change to the side which suffered wednesday 's humiliating 3 - 2 defeat to @entity77 in the @entity79 semi-final			0
@entity0 played 80 minutes of that match after @entity70 was stretchered off with a hamstring tear and was given the full 90 against the @entity19			1
he was far from the worst performer in either encounter but know he will have to continue making his mark or he will find himself relegated to the bench once more			0
@entity1 ' @entity86 climbs above the defence to direct a header at goal ' i have n't had much game time so when i do get a chance to play i try and make as much of an impact as i can and thankfully i 've managed to do that against @entity95 , ' he said			1
' there is a lot of competition for places and when you do get your chance you need to make an impact			0
' you have to take your chance when it comes and i try and work my socks off in training			0
' i got a good lay off from @entity22 for the goal , i 've ran off him and i just tried to stick it in the area and thankfully it 's gone in			0
' i 'll be grand come friday for @entity16 , i 've got five or six days to recover i 'm not quite that stiff - i 'd love to play again			0
