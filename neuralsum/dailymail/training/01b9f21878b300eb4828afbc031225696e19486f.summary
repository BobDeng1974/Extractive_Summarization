by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 21 february 2014 @entity2 : 01:53 est , 22 february 2014 dozens of coffin - shaped pits have opened up across a cemetery after weeks of rain caused the earth to give way over burial grounds			1
the alarming sinkhole phenomenon , which have exposed around 50 unmarked graves , raised fears deep cavities might be concealed just below the grass			1
visitors are being warned to watch their step after the giant holes appeared at @entity19 in @entity20			1
collapse : coffin - shaped holes have been opening up in the cemetery in @entity19 as a result of earth movements warning : visitors have been told to be careful where they step in this @entity19 cemetery after large holes began to open up several plots have sunk below ground level following weeks of heavy rain			1
worried cemetery bosses have revealed they have never before seen graves sinking into the ground on such a scale			1
a technique known as backfilling has so far failed , as the heavy rain has seen the soil compact down			2
now visitors have been warned to tread carefully - as holes may be lying underneath a mere ' carpet ' of grass			1
the graves , including those at another cemetery in @entity46 , have been sinking into the ground over the last fortnight			1
unsettling : heavy rain is being blamed for disturbing the earth and causing graves to collapse in on themselves patching up : the local council is busy backfilling the sunken graves with more soil a @entity55 spokesman said : ' it is quite common for graves to sink - especially after a period of heavy rain			1
' however none of the current staff has seen anything on this scale			0
both cemeteries have been affected but @entity64 is smaller and has been more manageable			2
' there are two main reasons why it has happened			0
urban sinkholes are more common after heavy rain , because they are caused by water flowing through channels below ground and eroding away soil or soft rock like limestone			1
as the earth is carried into other parts of the ground large caverns can open up , usually unknown to the authorities or the people living above them			2
once the cavern can not support the weight of the topsoil above it , it collapses into the ground			0
one of the world 's largest sinkholes , the @entity86 in @entity87 , is more than 2,000ft deep			0
' one is graves are backfilled with loose soil and they sink again once that soil gets so wet and heavy it compacts			1
' one of the first areas that showed a problem had been backfilled three times and needed doing again			0
' secondly in the old section of the cemetery the graves are deeper , so there are larger cavities for the soil to sink into			1
' we have been working hard to top up the affected graves using extra staff from other teams			2
' it is a gradual process but it is a priority to deal with them			0
' some of the graves have been taped off to keep people away from certain areas			0
families have been visiting the site to check on family members buried there			0
a sign warns : ' the ground staff are backfilling them as soon as they can , but due to the scale of the problem , have had to tape off some areas where the situation is particularly bad			0
' please be careful when walking on the grass as sometimes the soil has compacted but the grass remains like a carpet over the hole			2
' the recent spell of torrential rain and storms seems to have caused a spate of serious sinkholes to open up			2
hidden danger : erosion wearing away at a the earth above loose earth or a cavity is a common cause of sinkholes cordoned off : this enormous sinkhole opened up next to a house in @entity145 danger zone : this map shows where and when sinkholes have been appearing across @entity150 over the past few weeks three houses had to be evacuated after the massive 25ft - wide crater opened up in @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 on tuesday			1
the area around the property was cordoned off as engineers prepared to check on the property 's safety			0
last week a stretch of the @entity162 in north @entity20 was closed after a 15ft ( 4.6m ) deep hole was discovered in the central reservation , while on february 2 a teenager 's car was swallowed up when a 30ft ( 9.1m ) deep crater appeared in a family 's driveway in @entity170 , @entity171			2
a 35ft wide sinkhole opened up in a suburban cul - de - sac in @entity174 , @entity175 , at 7.30am on february 15 , forcing 17 houses to be evacuated and leaving one teetering over a 20ft drop			0
two of the houses could have to be demolished			0
damage : a large crack in a house in @entity183 , @entity154 , after a huge sinkhole has opened up in the street			0

dozens of coffin - shaped depressions have appeared in the ground
authorities are trying to fill the sinkholes in @entity19 cemetery , @entity20
weeks of rain blamed for compacting loose soil on top of the graves
visitors have been warned about ' carpet ' of grass concealing holes
around 50 graves affected by the subsidence over the past days
