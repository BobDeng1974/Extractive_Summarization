@entity1 's omission from @entity4 ’s @entity3 squad was criticised by the man who brought the fly - half out of the wilderness			1
sale director of rugby @entity9 , who signed @entity1 from @entity11 almost three years ago , described the selection of @entity14 ’s @entity13 as third - choice no 10 behind @entity15 and @entity16 as ‘ conservative ’ and claimed the 26 - year - old is judged by different standards to other players			1
‘ it does seem that he ’s always got to go the extra mile , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ @entity1 seems to have to prove himself far and above the other players			2
he ’s done his rehabilitation , if that ’s what you want to call it , and he ’s outstanding week in week out for us			0
i think the @entity3 coaches have been a little bit conservative			1
’ @entity1 has been left out of @entity4 's @entity3 squad for the autumn internationals sale coach @entity9 believes it is unfair that @entity1 has not been selected for @entity3 @entity1 has been one of @entity3 's leading no 10s this season but has been overlooked by @entity32 asked if he thought @entity1 would have been picked if he played for @entity14 , @entity9 simply replied ‘ yes ’			1
saracens wing @entity35 and @entity37 fly - half @entity33 were the other key absentees from @entity32 ’s 33 - man party for the @entity40			0
but @entity4 said of his choice : ‘ we have criteria for every position			0
we measure and mark every player			0
it does n’t matter if you ’re with a team that ’s first or eighth in the table			0
‘ what @entity9 ( @entity13 ) has shown is a very good consistent level of application , irrespective of whether he is on the front or back foot			1
the message @entity1 and @entity33 have both received is that everything is important			2

@entity4 's decision to pick @entity13 over @entity1 is a conservative and cautious decision @entity16 ( right ) has made a good start to the season even though his @entity64 side were beaten by @entity102			1

@entity104 signed @entity1 from @entity11
the coach believes his no 10 should have been selected for @entity3
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity13 all named in the squad
@entity9 labelled @entity3 's selections as ' conservative '
