by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 14:24 est , 26 february 2013 residents of @entity2 are up in arms at new plans to demolish part of the city 's famous wall in order to build luxury flats			1
the proposal to obliterate a key monument from @entity13 's history and replace it with accommodation to the super-rich has met with widespread outrage			0
however , the mayor of the district where the demolition is planned insists that it is necessary to connect the east and west sides of @entity2 better			1
watching on : police guard the @entity23 while tourists are photographed during a press conference held by the group ' @entity26 ! ' ( @entity27 the @entity26 ! ) and various other @entity2 clubs in @entity13 police guard : members of local action groups and a commission of clubs neighbouring the @entity35 border at the former @entity37 's death zone are protesting against the planned demolition of parts of the @entity23 for the three decades that it cut the city in half , the @entity37 was a global symbol of oppression and the divide between the communist and capitalist halves of the world			1
but since the city was united in november 1989 , what remains of the wall is considered to be an important monument to @entity13 's torrid history			2
in addition , the 0.8 - mile of wall known as the ' @entity23 ' is thought to attract as many as 1,000 visitors per day			2
the wall is covered in vivid graffiti , much of which was painted by some of the world 's leading street artists			0
controversial : policemen walk past a part of the @entity23 in @entity2 as protests were held against the planned demolition of parts of the @entity67 in order to construct luxury apartments iconic : the ' @entity23 ' is known as a leading display of street art since the fall of the wall however , part of the wall is set to be torn down to give access to ' @entity77 ' , a 200ft skyscraper being built on a strip of land between the wall and the @entity35 , according to @entity82			1
the tower will be divided into 36 luxury flats which are set to sell for up € 7,000 per square metre ( £ 560 per square foot )			0
@entity87 , mayor of the @entity89 district , told @entity90 that part of the wall would have to be demolished to connect his area with the neighbourhood of @entity94			0
location : the proposed site of the flats is in the heart of the @entity13 capital by the @entity35 demolition : a man helps to break down the wall with a pickaxe on november 9 , 1989 a new bridge , the ' @entity105 ' , will span the @entity35 and provide a further link between the two formerly divided parts of @entity2 - but can only be built if a section of the @entity23 is removed			1
locals have circulated a number of petitions protesting against the planned demolition , arguing that it would transform the historic and public nature of the area			0
nearby nightclubs , representing the traditional @entity118 lifestyle enjoyed by @entity119 during the @entity120 , have also joined the protests against further development .			0

residents protest against plan to knock down some of ' @entity23 '
but local mayor in @entity2 insists it 's necessary to link up two halves of city
