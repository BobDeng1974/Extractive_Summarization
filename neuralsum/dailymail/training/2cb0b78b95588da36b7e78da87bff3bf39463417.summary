researchers say the tax hike would deter young people from starting to smoke , and encourage smokers to quit completely rather than just switch to a cheaper brand			2
in most high - income countries , up to 60 per cent of the price of a pack of cigarettes is tax - whereas in most low and middle - income countries , tax accounts for up to 40 per cent of the cost			1
tripling tobacco taxes could prevent 200 million deaths worldwide and cut smoking by a third , a study has claimed the research - carried out by @entity25 - reviewed 63 studies on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in different countries			1
study co-author professor sir @entity30 said : ' the two certainties in life are death and taxes			0
we want higher tobacco taxes and fewer tobacco deaths			2
' it would help children not to start , and it would help many adults to stop while there 's still time			0
' globally , about half of all young men and one in 10 of all young women become smokers , and , particularly in developing countries , relatively few quit			2
researchers say the tax hike would deter young people from starting to smoke , and encourage smokers to quite completely rather than just switch to a cheaper brand ' if they keep smoking , about half will be killed by it , but if they stop before 40 , they 'll reduce their risk of dying from tobacco by 90 per cent			1
' he added : ' the international tobacco industry makes about £ 30 billion in profits each year - that 's a profit of approximately £ 6,000 per death from smoking			0
' research has shown that a 50 per cent higher inflation - adjusted price for cigarettes reduces tobacco consumption by about a fifth , with the biggest impact on the young and poor			1
as well as cutting consumption by a third , tripling tobacco taxes would also increase global government revenues from tobacco by a third , from £ 180 billion a year to £ 240 billion , said the researchers			0
in the @entity77 , a doubling of cigarette prices would prevent 100,000 deaths a year in the under 70s , they added			0
the findings are reported in the latest issue of the @entity82			0
dr @entity83 , chief executive of @entity25 , said : ' worldwide , around half a billion children and adults under the age of 35 are already - or soon will be - smokers , and many will be hooked on tobacco for life			1
' so there 's an urgent need for governments to find ways to stop people starting and to help smokers give up			0
' this immensely important study demonstrates that tobacco taxes are a hugely powerful lever , and potentially a triple win - reducing the numbers of people who smoke and who die from their addiction , reducing the health care burden and costs associated with smoking and yet , at the same time , increasing government income			1
' we urge all governments , not least the @entity111 , to take action by regularly raising tobacco taxes above inflation , and using occasional steep tax hikes starting with the next budget			0

move could also cut 200 million deaths worldwide , @entity25 say
in high - income countries , up to 60 per cent of price of pack is tax
in most low and middle - income countries , tax accounts for up to 40 per cent
