@entity3 , at the @entity1 conference in @entity2 today , wants to lift badly - paid workers out of tax and national insurance millions more middle - class taxpayers should be dragged into the 40p rate and hit with capital gains tax rises to help pay for tax breaks for the lower paid , @entity3 will say today			1
the deputy prime minister will oppose conservative plans to offer relief for the millions sucked into the higher rate of income tax			1
he will insist increases in the personal allowance and national insurance breaks must take priority over any increase in the threshold for the 40p rate , paid on income over £ 41,865			1
mr @entity3 says the @entity1 would also raise capital gains tax , paid on the sale of assets such as second homes or shares , from 28 per cent to about 35 per cent for higher - rate taxpayers , raising £ 500 million a year			1
the income that can be made before capital gains tax kicks in would also be slashed dramatically , from £ 10,900 to about £ 2,500 , raising about £ 250 million a year			2
that will drag thousands of people with small savings – such as someone who has worked hard to build up some shares for retirement – into the capital gains tax net			0
mr @entity3 ’s move opens up a key election dividing line with the @entity41 , who have promised both a hike in the income tax threshold to £ 12,500 and an increase in the 40p threshold to £ 50,000 at their conference			1
he will say that his party wants to press on with cutting income tax straight away if it remains in government after the election			2
the first rise in the personal allowance , taking it to £ 11,000 , should take place in april 2016 , he says			0
this is worth about £ 100 a year to workers who earn over next year ’s income tax threshold of £ 10,500 a year – roughly 29 million people			1
aides said the 40p threshold would be reduced so that higher - rate taxpayers did not benefit more than those on the basic rate			1
‘ everyone will benefit from the increase in the personal allowance , including higher - rate taxpayers , but it ’s not right higher - rate taxpayers should do better than everyone else , ’ said one			2
mr @entity3 has already announced plans to further increase the personal allowance to £ 12,500 a year by 2020 – a policy matched by the @entity41 at its conference last week			1
the latest @entity77 survey shows how just eight per cent of people now say they will vote @entity1 - down from almost a third at the last election deputy prime minister @entity3 ( centre ) will address the party conference in @entity2 tomorrow but after this point , he said the party would make taking more low earners out of paying national insurance a priority – not relief for those on the 40p rate , who now include better - paid nurses , teachers and police officers			1
mr @entity3 insisted that tax rises should ‘ start at the top and work down , not start at the bottom and work up ’			0
a @entity100 spokesman said : ‘ you ca n’t trust a word @entity3 and the @entity1 say			2
they say they want fairer taxes for working people but in government they have given millionaires a tax break while everyone else pays more			0
’ the @entity1 have rejected proposals for any new runways in @entity113 , in a major blow to @entity3			2
activists voted against a change in party policy to support airport expansion in the @entity119 despite mr @entity3 urging supporters to allow a new runway at @entity122			1
but the policy also specified ' no net increase in runways across the @entity113 as a whole '			0
speaking after the vote , @entity127 mp @entity126 said the party ' has made a clear decision ' , adding the issue would be ' an important part of coalition discussions ' with other parties if there was another hung @entity137			0
schools minister @entity138 said the party would ' respect ' the outcome of the vote			0
he told @entity142 's @entity144 programme : ' we do n't just ignore decisions of our party conference			0
' we 've debated this twice at party conference , of course we '' ll consider on the federal policy committee and on the manifesto committee the precise way in which our commitments on this will be framed			0
' but the idea that we 're going to ignore this vote is not the way we do things , and the basic approach that we agreed today will go into the manifesto			0
we 're a party that respects the views of our members			0

workers on less than £ 12,500 to pay no tax or national insurance
policy will form centre - piece of the @entity1 's bid to win back support
conservatives want to raise 40p rate from £ *42,000* to £ 50,000
but @entity177 dems say priority is the to cut @entity179 for low paid
party is currently sitting *fourth* in the polls with just 8 *%* support
