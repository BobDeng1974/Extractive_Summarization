five prisoners released thursday from the @entity2 prison at @entity3 , @entity4 included hard - core @entity6 members who traveled and worked closely with terror leaders @entity8 and @entity9			1
the move is being seen as part of the @entity14 administration 's effort to shutter the military detention center , a promise the president made during his 2008 campaign but which he has yet to fulfill			1
although an administration task force found in 2009 that they no longer posed a great enough threat to keep behind razor wire indefinitely , classified documents demonstrate that only a year earlier they were deemed high - risk and likely to re-engage in hostilities against the @entity24 and its allies			1
in an april 2008 evaluation report , the @entity26 determined that one of the men , 36 - year - old @entity29 citizen @entity28 , was ' a member of @entity6 who reportedly accompanied @entity8 throughout @entity32			1
' scroll down to read the intelligence reports the @entity2 detention facility at @entity3 , @entity4 is a political hot potato , with president @entity14 insisting it should be closed and congressional republicans saying there 's nowhere safe to send hardened @entity6 terrorists @entity40 detainees @entity41 ( left ) and @entity42 ( right ) have been released to the government of @entity44 @entity28 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) were sent to the nation of @entity47 intelligence agents learned that he went with the 9/11 mastermind as he toured @entity32 to receive ' bayat ' – declarations of allegiance – from terror cell leaders			1
less than a year before the @entity14 administration first reclassified him as a detainee who could leave , the @entity26 ruled that @entity28 was a ' high risk ' prisoner , ' as he is likely to pose a threat to the @entity24 , its interests and allies			1
' he was also described in the report as having ' high intelligence value ' to the @entity24			2
that assessment was based on the conclusion that he was ' a member of @entity9 's @entity63 , a @entity66 [ @entity65 ] cell intended to conduct ied attacks against @entity24 and @entity69 forces			1
a second released terror suspect , 37 - year - old @entity42 , also from @entity29 , was an @entity6 forger			2
another april 2008 @entity26 report referred to him as ' an @entity6 facilitator located in @entity75 providing travel and false travel documents to @entity79 extremists attempting to enter @entity32			1
' he , too , was deemed ' a high risk , as he is likely to pose a threat to the @entity24 , its interests , and allies			1
' @entity42 , his assessment concluded , ' is an assessed @entity6 member who has information on @entity6 associated guesthouses and safe houses in @entity32 and @entity75			1
' in january 2009 before @entity14 's task force met , the @entity26 declared in a supplemental report that he was ' a probable recidivist candidate			1
' ' if released without rehabilitation , close supervision , and means to successfully reintegrate into his society as a law - abiding citizen , ' the addemdum read , ' it is assessed detainee would seek out prior associates and reengage in hostilities and extremist support activities at home and abroad			2
' the reports covering @entity104 and @entity42 recommended ' continued detention under @entity26 control ' for both men			2
@entity42 was released to @entity44			0
@entity108 went to the former @entity110 nation of @entity47			0
@entity41 , a 48 - year - old @entity111 , was a member of an @entity113 extremist organization called the @entity114			1
his classified assessment revealed that in 2004 , he was convicted in absentia on terrorism - related charges for his role in suicide attacks – ' including a foiled attack against @entity24 military personnel at the @entity122 in @entity123			1
' his jailers considered him a high - risk prisoner , writing in 2008 that he had ' holds anti-us sentiment and on more than one occasion has threatened to kill members of the guard force			1
' an older assessment on another inmate released this week , written in 2004 , concerned the 52 - year - old @entity132 , a @entity134 - born @entity29 man			0
he was trained to use rocket - propelled grenades and small arms at the @entity139 terrorist camp in @entity32 , the @entity26 found			1
and ' in @entity142 , the detainee and his family stayed in an apartment provided by the @entity144			0
' ' this detainee is a member of @entity6 and / or its global terrorist network , ' the report concluded , adding that he ' has demonstrated a commitment to jihad , has links to key facilitators in @entity6 's international terrorist network , has participated in terrorist training , likely participated in direct hostilities against the @entity24 and coalition forces , and maintains the capability to continue to do so if released			2
' the report 's author , @entity158 brigadier general @entity157 , wrote that @entity132 's specialized terror training suggested that the only safe way to release him would be to transfer him to the @entity134 , where he could be monitored intensely			0
' he is likely to pose a threat to the @entity24 , its interests and allies , ' @entity157 wrote the @entity26 reports , classified as ' secret , ' were first released by the controversial @entity168 website in 2011 but have since been lost in the @entity170 's staticky coverage of @entity24 's war on terror			1

' “ i have written to @entity190 expressing my frustration and great concern over a new swell of recidivism			0
if just one @entity24 soldier loses their life over these transfers , we will have failed in our duty to the @entity24 people			0
' ' what the @entity202 is doing is dangerous and , frankly , reckless , ' @entity183 said			0
' they have chosen many times to put politics above national security			0
it ’s time they stop playing with fire and start doing what ’s right			0
until we can assure the terrorists stay off the battlefield , they must stay behind bars			0
' @entity47 @entity217 sen. @entity217 , likely to be the next chairman of the @entity219 , also slammed the @entity220 for its latest move			0
' for years , we ’ve seen the president put politics over @entity24 ’s national security by releasing @entity3 detainees and transferring them to other nations , ' he said in a statement			1
' dangerous and , frankly , reckless ' : @entity185 chairman rep. @entity183 blasted the @entity220 ' these are dangerous terrorists who will continue to plot ways to harm and kill @entity24 , just like previous detainees released to foreign countries who have reengaged in terrorism			2
' @entity14 , he said , ' seems more occupied with efforts to fulfill a campaign promise than ensuring these terrorists can not rejoin the fight			0
' @entity3 now holds 143 prisoners , about 100 fewer than the number when @entity14 took office			1
@entity243 had repeatedly prohibited the release of any inmate to domestic @entity24 prisons and put tight restrictions on other releases as well			2
but those limits were mostly lifted in december 2013 , and more of what the @entity220 and the @entity26 call ' resettlements ' are expected before the end of the year			0
another 74 prisoners at @entity3 have already been cleared to leave			2
fifty - five got the green light from an @entity14 - appointed task force in 2010			2
