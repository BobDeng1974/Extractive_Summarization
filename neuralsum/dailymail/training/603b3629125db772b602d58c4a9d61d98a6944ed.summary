spectators at air shows are usually impressed by the boom of fighter jets flying overhead			0
but aeroplane fans at the @entity5 were also wowed by the eerily quiet flight of @entity8 's fully - electric aircraft			1
the prototype two - seater made its maiden flight in march but only took to the skies in front of the public last week			1
the batteries fixed to the wings are the sole power source for the two motors			0
an electric motor in the main wheel provides extra power during acceleration and taxiing to prevent a drain of power while the plane is on the ground			1
it has a wingspan of 31.2 feet ( 9.5 metres ) and weighs 1,212 pounds ( 550 kilograms ) it can fly for about half an hour at 110 miles ( 177 kilometres ) per hour			2
there is currently a back - up battery for landing and a parachute in case the pilot goes out of range			0
just like on an electric car , a gauge on the dashboard tells the pilot how much energy remains in the batteries before the aircraft has to be recharged			0
one of the main landing gear wheels has a small electric motor that can propel the airplane up to 35 miles ( 55 km ) per hour to maximise flight time			1
it was designed from scratch , from its electrical propulsion and energy management system to its safety features			0
@entity8 hopes that the prototype is one step towards the aerospace industry using regional jets powered by hybrid electric engines , which would slash its carbon dioxide emissions			1
the development of a regional plane , seating between 70 and 90 people that can take off and land using electric power , could take between 15 and 20 years , @entity8 chief technology officer @entity75 told reporters in @entity83			2
the company 's @entity17 aircraft is powered by two electric motors with a combined output of 60 kilowatts			1
@entity8 says it is suited for short missions such as pilot training and aerobatics and can currently run on its lithium - ion polymer batteries for half an hour , reaching speeds of up to 110 miles ( 177 kilometres ) per hour			1
the future today : the @entity17 was designed from scratch around its electrical propulsion from its safety features to its energy management system			0
it is hoped the technology will be used in commercial aircraft in the future to slash carbon dioxide emissions engineers aim to double that fly time , but mr @entity75 said : ' they [ the batteries ] are causing us a lot of headaches			0
' he declined to comment on how much the group was investing in hybrid and electric technologies			0
the two - seater @entity17 will be built at @entity111 in southwest @entity24 and production could start at the end of 2017			0
mr @entity75 said he would like to see a prototype for a regional jet in 2030			2
a pilot sits inside the @entity8 model of the e-fan 2.0 prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at the @entity23 airport			1
the @entity17 is a technology demonstrator of a fully electrically - powered , all - composite aircraft thumbs up : @entity124 and industry minister @entity123 ( right ) and test pilot @entity125 ( left ) show their pride after a demonstration flight of @entity17			2

@entity8 has *unveiled* their all - electric e-fan 2.0 prototype electric aircraft
the aeroplane made a public flight at the @entity5
its duct fans are powered by an electric motor and battery and it can fly for about half an hour and reach speeds of 110 *mph* ( *177km/h* )
the tech could serve as a step to putting electric motors on *larger* planes
@entity8 is planning to fly regional planes with hybrid engines by 2030
