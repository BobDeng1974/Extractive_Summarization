by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:50 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 2 august 2013 @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and that @entity6 model all have one thing in common : a brilliant , bang - on - trend beard			2
facial fuzz has become the must - have accessory for stylish men about town , from grey - flecked designer stubble on the @entity14 to fearsome facial furniture being displayed at your local pub. and now the women of @entity19 ca n't seem to get enough as news of photo project @entity22 spreads like wildfire through social media			1

' this was one of the most popular photographs i captured			2
@entity33 is a model and has an incredible beard			2
one search on @entity37 will reveal why the photo got such a great response - he has a huge fan base ' @entity41 : @entity42 , @entity43			2
number 67 from 5 sep 2012			2
@entity25 : ' photographed on @entity44 , @entity41 is one of the youngest guys i photographed			1
for me , it 's his photo which shows why the beard is popular for young men - it 's their first chance to experiment with being a grown - up man and tell that to the world ' the @entity54 project started in 2012 and has been so successful @entity25 has carried on taking pictures and is now at well over 200			1
and the women of the web are sharing the love for his work			1
@entity61 says beards on men such as those featured in @entity25 's project look like they have a ' stronger jaw '			1
' they look more manly , and beards are fun to run my fingers through			1
' @entity71 went a step further sharing her love of @entity25 's bearded blokes lies in the fact : ' they look like they could save you from danger , like a fire or if you were stuck on a mountain ! ' a self - confessed bearded baldie said : ' beards rule for baldies			1
only way we can get a fresh hairstyle			1
' @entity87 said : ' they look like they 're too busy building things and rocking out to care about shaving , ' while @entity91 commented bears like these make men ' look more manly '			2
tweet us @ @entity95 with your beardy pictures - friends , boyfriends , brothers , that bearded wonder who works in your local coffee shop - and we will upload a selection of the best			1

on 31 jul ( wednesday ) @entity112 sports an auburn beard as he stands on @entity114 , @entity43			0
from 26 apr 2013 @entity115 said : ' they are just sexier , more manly			0
a man with a clean shaven face looks like a boy , ' as @entity120 confessed ' in our world of well - groomed metrosexuals us girls need a little caveman to remind us of the @entity126 '			1
the girls of @entity128 have also got in a flutter as @ apalanca shared a link to the blog saying ' hunky men with beards , ' as @ amylilyhowes said : ' how about all of the beards in all of the days ? ' @entity25 , the blog 's founder , men 's style expert and editor of style site @entity142 said : ' over the past few years , the beard has re-established itself as the ultimate accessory for the modern gentleman			1
to document this , every day for 100 days i photographed a new beard on the streets of @entity43			0
' from big and bushy to trendy and trimmed , i found men from all cultures and creeds who signed up to the cult of the beard			0
@entity110 takes a slow drag on a cigarette as he leans against a wall on @entity159 , @entity43 on 18 jul 2012 female fans have been proclaiming their admiration for @entity25 's bearded hunks on social media @entity164 was captured at @entity165 , @entity43			1
number 143 in the series			0
taken on 25 jul 2013 ' @entity167 is a @entity168 tailor for @entity169 and has become something of a @entity19 style institution			0
he 's certainly one of @entity43 's best dress men and was recently a judge on the @entity175 's @entity174 ' ' for me , the beard represents authenticity and masculinity in equal parts			1
in a time of uncertainty , like a global financial crisis , it makes sense that this is how men want to be seen			0
also if we consider the beard as a fashion trend , it 's the best accessory a man can own - it 's free , completely unique , very personal and not too flashy , ' says @entity25			1
' as a trend , the beard wo n't last			0
that 's the nature of trends - they come and go			1
however , i reckon the resurgence of the appreciate of the hirsute is here to stay for a while			0
once you 've dedicated time and energy cultivating a beard it 's unlikely you 'll be giving it up at the drop of a hat			1
for many of the men i photographed their beard was n't trend - led , it was as much a form of personal expression as the hair on their head			0
' it 's so difficult to place as there is a huge variety			1
for me i think density , colour and shape are all important factors			0
i 've photographed one man with a huge sprawling white beard - completely unkempt and natural			1
that 's equally as impressive as then gent with a tightly clipped thick bright red beard			1
' @entity229 is a artist who was immortalised in a painting which became the poster for last years @entity232 ' @entity233 : @entity234 , @entity43			0
from 15 jul 2013 ' @entity235 , 100 days project started on july 1st 2012 and the original concept was simple			0
i went out to different neighbourhoods in @entity43 every day for the next 100 days until october 8th , and over that period the blog had really exploded			0
in the final month , nearly every guy i stopped to be photographed had heard of the blog which was incredible			0
i was receiving comments , tweets & emails en mass from fans of facial hair asking to continue documenting @entity43 's beards , so i decided to continue			1
' i 've been taking beard portraits for 13 months now , mostly in @entity43 but also in @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253			0
i 've now reached number 146 on the blog , but i 'm planning to have 200 beard portraits for the release of the book next month			0
possibly the hardest part of this kind of work is selecting the portraits to use			0
i 've photographed more than 200 men , but only the right portraits get used			0
the book will include funny quotes and anecdotes about their beards from the subjects			1
' when i first started the 100 beards project , i had a lot of people tweeting me asking if i had a beard myself			1
i did n't , and so as tribute i decided to try growing one for the first time ' ' when i first started the 100 beards project , i had a lot of people tweeting me asking if i had a beard myself			2
i did n't , and so as tribute i decided to try growing one for the first time			0
i spent about 8 weeks working on getting some good growth and on day 100 took a self - portrait to complete the first chapter			0
' one of the reasons i became interested in beards was my own inability to grow a good one			2
beards have this mysterious masculinity attached to them and to grow a strong one is like the holy grail of authenticity			2
once i got past the itchy phase of the beard i started to enjoy it , but mine pales in comparison to the men i photographed so it 's now gone			2
@entity301 will have to be enough for me			0
' during the 100 days , from july 1 to october 8 2012 , the 100 beard project received a huge amount of support , so much so i decided to continue			0
i want to thank everyone from readers to press who shared the project and appreciated the work			0
' the initial 100 @entity311 project has already been immortalised in a book , with another on the way , but more recently it has seen a slew of new interest from female fans of facial hair , as women around @entity19 have been sharing @entity25 's @entity321 account via @entity322 and @entity128 , often with 1,500 comments per picture			1
you can preorder the book at Â£ 20 on his website			0
the @entity328 is one year old			0
you can pre-order a copy of the book at 100beards.bigcartel.com @entity2 and @entity3 have championed the beard trend in @entity332 the brooding backpacker look : @entity6 's new model sports a bushy beard and tumbling , long hair			2
