tartan terrorist : an undated picture of @entity4 separatist @entity2 who has been charged with emailing a series of bomb threats to @entity8 the founding member of a @entity4 terror group has been charged with emailing 17 bomb threats to the @entity8 which caused widespread panic and forced the evacuation of more than 100 buildings			1
@entity15 , 64 , currently in custody in @entity17 , @entity18 , allegedly sent a series of threats to the school between april 6 and 21 , and sent similar emails to federal courthouses in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 in june			1
@entity2 is also charged with threatening @entity24 - based @entity28 attorney @entity27 - who led the investigation that resulted in @entity2 's indictment - in a june 20 email			0
a prolific hoaxer , @entity2 was convicted in @entity18 in 2010 for sending a series of emails claiming that there were explosive devices on flights between @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity40			2
he was sentenced to four years in prison but was released early this year and allegedly sent the @entity8 threats before he was returned to prison last month			2
it is not clear when he will be brought to @entity24 to face the new charges			0
curiously @entity2 has no known ties to @entity24 or the university , and mr @entity27 would n't comment on why he allegedly sent the threats or whether they 're related to his activities with the @entity51 , an outlawed militant group that seeks @entity4 independence from the @entity53			2
@entity2 is now charged with threatening to poison some @entity55 water supplies and then - prime minister @entity56 in 2010 , along with some bomb hoaxes he allegedly called in to hotels and the media			2
he suffers from multiple sclerosis and appeared in a wheelchair before the @entity62 in @entity17 last month			0
the university began receiving bomb threats written on bathroom stalls in mid-february , for which nobody has yet been charged			1
investigators do n't believe those threats are tied to @entity2 , who allegedly sent his emails to capitalize on the momentum from the earlier threats			2
the university was eventually the target of more than 40 emailed threats - some sent to the school , and others to local journalists who alerted authorities - all of which are attributed to @entity2 , though he 's charged with sending only 17 of them			1
@entity27 said the investigation involved complex efforts to trace the emails through overseas computer servers			0
typically , federal authorities in wire fraud cases file charges for only a representative sampling of counts for which they have the most evidence			0
in all , the university received 52 threats against 160 buildings that prompted 136 evacuations , @entity91 chancellor @entity91 said wednesday			1
students wait on the street after being evacuated from the @entity8 after a bomb threat was received in april prosecutors also announced new charges against two @entity102 men , including one previously charged in june , for some @entity104 threats that claimed university computers had been hacked			1
those threats are not directly related to the bomb scares , but were uncovered as a result of the same investigation some emailed threats claimed to be sent by a group calling itself the @entity112 - now identified as @entity2 - who expressed anger that the university issued a $ 50,000 reward for what the email suggested were harmless pranks			1
@entity2 , as @entity119 , allegedly emailed the student newspaper , the @entity120 , promising to stop if the university withdrew the reward			0
the university complied on april 21 , although school officials did n't explain then why the reward was being withdrawn			0
@entity2 faces 17 counts of wire fraud , each carrying up to 20 years in prison , 16 counts of sending false information or hoaxes each carrying up to 10 years , and two counts of international extortion , which carry up to two years each			2
the april 21 reward ultimatum was n't deemed a hoax because the threats stopped after the university withdrew the reward			0
the extortion counts relate to the ultimatum and a similar april 10 email that the university disregarded as unreliable because it contained misspellings and factual errors , @entity91 said			0
the threats cost the school more than $ 300,000 in direct expenses , including overtime for police and other staff , bomb squads and special equipment to detect such devices			1
that does n't include time lost by faculty and students , who were evacuated from dorms at all hours			0
@entity2 is the only person so far to be charged in connection with the bomb threats , though federal authorities charged an @entity102 man in june with the @entity104 video			1
that man , @entity159 , 24 , of @entity160 , @entity102 , was charged again wednesday along with @entity161 , 26 , of @entity162 , @entity102 , with conspiracy to target @entity8 with @entity165 threats for the video and related emails and tweets from april 25 through may 23			1
the men , allegedly claiming to be part of the hacking group @entity170 , threatened to release the computer files unless @entity91 publicly apologized for not safeguarding students from the bomb threats			1
@entity8 officials determined the computer information was never hacked			0
the men declined to comment when reached by the @entity176 @entity27 said @entity159 and @entity161 will turn themselves in next week to be arraigned on the charge , which carries up to five years in prison .			0
