the glorious conditions experienced last weekend , however , already seem like a distant memory but @entity113 forecasters say there will still be some ' pockets of fine weather ' , it just depends ' where and when you ' catch them ' there is a lot of weather going on and it is looking quite unsettled			0

recently , the jet stream has been further south - which is why the @entity2 has experienced such wet summers			1
a band of high pressure is blocking the path of the jet stream , meaning that the present weather conditions will stay until this pressure moves			1
' the jet stream is a narrow band of fast moving wind high up in the atmosphere , which effectively can steer in low pressure systems off the @entity175 which then get caught up in this area ' where that jet stream sits is important			1
if it is to the north , we get settled conditions			0
' to the south we get unsettled conditions sent to us			0
' at the moment it is sitting more or less over us or just to the south			0
' we will see some bright spells in between , where it is sunny with some pretty decent temperatures , but the weather is moving through quite quickly			0
