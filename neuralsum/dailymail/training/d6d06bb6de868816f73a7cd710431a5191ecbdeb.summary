but mr @entity9 said it would not change his belief that dr @entity10 presents a danger to the public , even though the @entity18 authorities are satisfied he is safe to practise			1

' i have been banned from using a certain phrase and i wo n't use that phrase			0

error : an inquest found @entity9 , 70 , ( left ) was unlawfully killed in 2008 after dr @entity10 , who was working as an out - of - hours locum on his first shift in the @entity13 , fatally administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine four years ago mr @entity9 's sons sought him out and called @entity59 - born @entity10 a ' charlatan ' and a ' killer ' and demanded he explain his ' colossal blunder '			1
shortly before they were thrown out of the conference , @entity16 muttered to his brother that @entity10 was an ' animal ' – something he had said he was unaware of until it was mentioned in legal documents long after the incident in 2010			2
accord to the @entity104 the legal fees he would be expected runs into the thousands			0
' it makes me feel physically sick , it is quite hard to believe , ' @entity16 , who lives in @entity18 and works for the country 's weather office , told the @entity104			0

' @entity121 has thanked us , the politicians have thanked us but now this			0
it shows the man has no integrity , no remorse			0
' brother : @entity16 was sued for remarks he made when he and his brother @entity20 ( pictured ) , himself a gp from @entity129 , confronted the doctor at a medical conference in @entity134 , @entity22 the medic was struck off by the @entity13 @entity121 but was able to continue working in @entity18			1
he was charged with death by negligence at a court in @entity139 but was let off with a nine - month suspended prison sentence and ordered him to pay costs of 5,000 euros , or £ 4,100			1
the disgraced doctor has since refused to return to the @entity13 , and a @entity119 arrest warrant was issued by @entity144 but could not be carried out because legal proceedings had begun in @entity18			1
