thousands of migrants living illegally in sheds and garages are to be flushed out by thermal images taken from the air			2
the photographs will reveal if heat is coming from the outbuildings , indicating that they are inhabited			0
@entity9 believes that up to 3,000 people are being housed in the unsafe and primitive ‘ sheds with beds ’ , which often lack heating or running water			1
illegal : @entity16 hopes to crackdown on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal living accommodation , such as this conversion , pictured @entity22 first : a plane equipped with thermal imaging cameras will fly over the town of @entity9 , @entity26 , to track sheds being used to illegally house immigrants ( computerised image ) a plane fitted with state - of - the - art kit will fly over the town as @entity9 becomes the first local authority in the @entity22 to use thermal imaging to clamp down on people living illegally in outbuildings			1
it is not known exactly how many so - called ' sheds with beds ' there are in @entity9 , but estimates range from 700 to 3,000			1
the council has warned that if the cameras detect where workers are living , their sheds may be bulldozed			1
the council has commissioned geographic imaging company @entity46 to produce a thermal map of the town , which officers will use to pin - point warm areas in outbuildings , indicating where humans may be living			1
the plane will fly over the whole borough to collect the data as soon as the conditions are @entity58 , the council 's head of environmental services and resilience , said : ' our primary concern is making sure people are not living in unsafe conditions , with little or no heating , or in places that do not comply with building or fire safety regulations			1
clampdown : some of the illegal conversions are used to hide immigrants in poor and crowded living conditions ' aerial photography is one of a range of tactics we 're using to crack down on this problem and we hope evidence of heat in outbuildings will help us build a true picture of how many sheds are being lived in and where they are			2
' we will be able to cross-check and see whether they have valid @entity87 which are required by law for places where people live			0
' if they do n't , we will be speaking to landlords and offering some advice and guidance , and enforcing the law if we need to			0
' one option is to repeatedly fine a landlord for not having an @entity87			0
the fine is £ 200 a day , making it very expensive for people to continue using the outbuilding			0
' forced demolition of sheds with beds , although an option for the council , particularly if a property is unsafe , is often a lengthy , costly process			2
other options for enforcement action include returning sheds to their legal use , such as a garage or store room , and in some cases granting permission for them to be used as a home , meaning that landlords will then be required to pay council tax and ensure they are energy and fire compliant			2
growing problem : @entity16 estimates there are between 700 to 3,000 ' beds in shed ' in the town councillor @entity125 , deputy leader and commissioner for neighbourhoods and renewal , said : ' the people living in them generate waste , they use council services and they have a cost to the council that is n't being paid for by taxation			1
' it causes pressure on parking and driveways and we get neighbourhood complaints about densely built gardens			0
' some of these buildings are perfectly habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend their use or have them removed			0
' the buildings often have planning permission as something else , a store or a garage , and then kitchens and things have arrived later			0
' the first thing we try and do is obviously to return them to their permitted use			0
cut backs : @entity16 says people living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them some of the buildings uncovered may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished ' in some cases we can regularise them as a dwelling and levy council tax on them and make sure they are energy and fire compliant			1
' we let them exist but we make sure they are paying their share towards the cost of existing			0
' in the worst cases we have to take the whole building down , demolish it and remove the people living in it			1
' the council is one of a handful of local authorities which has been granted extra money from the government to help improve conditions in houses of multi-occupancy and reduce the number of sheds being used as accommodation without permission			2
the occupants of sheds in @entity9 are believed to be mostly single adults or childless couples with low incomes			1
the thermal imaging cameras on the plane , stock image pictured , will be able to locate where people are living in the town by their body heat example : this thermogram image shows the sort of data a thermal imaging camera will capture by flying over slough long - term , it is hoped the thermal imaging data will also be used to improve energy efficiency in homes across the borough			1
councillor @entity218 said : ' i think it is an outrage			0
i get so offended by it and i want to see the back of them			0
' there are so many unscrupulous landlords flouting the law in such a fashion and quite an epic scale , i think we have to be incredibly robust in the way we deal with them			0
' somebody told me in @entity233 they have actually knocked some of these sheds down and that 's the kind of approach i want to see in @entity9			2
councillor @entity218 said @entity9 , which has a large mixed - race population , risks becoming ' colonised with sheds with beds unless something is done about it '			1
last august it was announced that @entity9 council had been given more than £ 200,000 to tackle rogue landlords who house people in converted sub-standard outbuildings			1
last year it was announced that @entity9 had been selected by government housing minister @entity251 in may for funding to ' flush out dodgy landlords ' who are ' trapping vulnerable people ' in converted sheds			1
the council is targeting key problem wards including @entity257 and @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 and has employed an additional planning enforcement officer , a barrister to pursue legal action and has taken on a part - time administrator to co-ordinate and liaise with officers across five council departments			0
mr @entity251 said last year : ' i 'm determined to flush out criminal landlords who think they can make an easy buck from cramped , cockroach - ridden outhouses			2
the scandal of ' beds in sheds ' must come to an end			0

@entity9 council is the first to use the cameras to clampdown on ' landlords '
there are believed to be between 700 to 3,000 ' beds in sheds ' in @entity9
state - of - the - art kit will fly over the town to spot people living in outhouses
