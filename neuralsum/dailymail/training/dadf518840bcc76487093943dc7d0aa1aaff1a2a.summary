it might come as a surprise to those struggling to comprehend accents from @entity4 , @entity5 or parts of @entity7 but the @entity9 accent really is the hardest one to get your tongue around			1
but , say authors and language experts @entity15 and @entity16 , there are some bonuses in being from @entity9			1
while the accent might not be the most popular at home , it sounds positively mellifluous to those hailing from foreign climes			1
now the pair have penned a book in which they decode the mysteries of the @entity27 accent - and some of it is nothing short of eye - opening ... baffling : the stars of @entity34 drama @entity32 needed extra help to master the tricky @entity9 accent some accents are harder to imitate than others , and the @entity40 accent is one of the hardest - but with some strong competition from @entity43			1
of course , difficulty is relative			0
it depends where you 're coming from			0
a five - year - old growing up in @entity9 will have mastered the accent with no trouble at all			1
but if you compare it to @entity52 - the @entity27 prestige accent used by the @entity54 , and the traditional voice of the @entity34 - it 's easy to see why @entity40 is felt to be tricky			1
when you notice a regional accent , what you 're chiefly noticing are the way people pronounce their long vowels ( in words like see , saw , and sue ) and diphthongs ( in words like say , so , sow , soy , and sigh )			2
appreciated : as @entity66 and @entity67 have found , the @entity40 accent gets a big welcome abroad @entity70 has quite a few of these , and the more an accent sounds them differently from the way you speak , the more difficulty you 'll have in ' picking up ' that accent			1
some accents will be very close to your own , so you would have only a few features to learn			2
but @entity9 and @entity43 are two that - compared with @entity52 - have lots of really noticeable differences , such as these three : the diphthong in words like float has a much more open onset , so that it sounds more like @entity52 flout			1
the diphthong in words like nice begins with a back and rounded quality , so that it sounds like ‘ noice ’			0
the diphthong in words like loud begins with a front and higher quality , so that it sounds more like ‘ le - ood ’			0
no wonder actress @entity92 looked for help while working on the first series of @entity32 , asking a @entity9 - born actress for guidance about her accent			1
no bar to office : @entity100 , who was prime minister between 1937 and 1940 , had a @entity40 accent @entity102 are loved abroad in @entity27 , during the 20th century , thanks to the way it was portrayed on radio and television , the @entity40 accent picked up all kinds of negative atitudes			1
but abroad , it 's perceived in a very different way			0
once , in a summer school for foreign learners of @entity70 , i played the students a dozen @entity27 accents and asked them to rate them for beauty			1
more evidence : not long ago , a nightclub owner in @entity121 advertised in @entity9 's sunday @entity122 for staff to come and work in his club during the winter months			2
the owner said : ' i love the accent , and nightclub - goers ca n't get enough of it over here			0
i believe you can go a long way if you can speak the @entity9 way '			2
and he concludes : ' i 've heard enough holiday - makers from the region to know it 's the best accent by far '			0
@entity52 has n't been around very long received pronunciation is only around 200 years old			0
it emerged towards the end of the 18th century as an upper - class accent , and soon became the voice of the public schools , the civil service , and the @entity144			0
when the @entity34 began broadcasting , in the 1920 's , its founder , @entity146 ( a @entity146 ) opted for @entity52 as the @entity34 's voice on the grounds that it would be the most widely understood			0
@entity27 has more @entity149 there are more accents per square mile in @entity27 than in any other part of the @entity70 - speaking world			1
this is because of the hugely diverse history of @entity70 in the @entity157 , with the originally germanic dialects of @entity159 mixing with the @entity160 , the @entity162 accents of the @entity163 , and wave after wave of immigration from the @entity167 down to the present day			2
but it 's also because of the rise of ' mixed ' accents , as people move house around the country and pick up features of the accent wherever they find themselves			1
we all have more than one accent everyone has more than one accent			0
our pronunciation changes subtly depending on who we 're talking to and how we get on with them			0
linguists call it ' accommodation '			0
some people have a natural flair for picking up accents , but everyone does it to some extent			2
you only notice you 've done it when someone asks ' are you from round here ? ' and you ca n't think of a satisfactory reply			0
@entity27 is no longer @entity198 there are now far more @entity70 accents outside the @entity157 than within			1
accents express the identity of a community , so in every country that @entity70 has come to be used - and that means everywhere - a new accent has evolved			2
and when you think that there are over two billion people speaking @entity70 now , that 's a lot of accents .			0
