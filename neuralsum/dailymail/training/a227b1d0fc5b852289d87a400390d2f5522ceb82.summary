by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:30 pm on 20th october 2011 when it was built , it was hailed as one of the finest buildings of its age – only to be destroyed 150 years later			1
now @entity8 ’s ‘ lost ’ palace can be seen for the first time in more than 300 years – in a scale model based on 50 years of research			2
the replica of @entity13 – so named because there was no other like it – took 1,250 hours to make			1
majestic : @entity18 can be seen in all its glory for the first time in more than 300 years after a model maker recreated it thanks to an @entity25 professor 's research intricate : @entity26 spent 1,250 hours building the detailed @entity28 replica and worked from professor @entity30 's extensive research and plans visitors to site of @entity8 's ' lost ' palace today would have little clue of its majestic past			1
the remains of @entity13 consists mainly of 700 acres of green open space , located between @entity40 and @entity41 in @entity42			1
@entity8 began building the elaborate royal pad set in vast hunting grounds in 1538 in celebration of the birth of his longed - for male heir @entity47 – and as a glittering demonstration of @entity50 power			0
the height of extravagance , the palace had cost over £ 24,000 by the time @entity8 died in 1547 – and was still incomplete			0
sadly , little of it remains save a few foundations - bizarrely , @entity56 gave it to his mistress the @entity58 in 1670 , then allowed her to demolish it and sell off the parts to pay for gambling debts in 1682			0
it measures 7.2ft by 4ft ( 2.2m by 1.2m ) and is made of wood , with intricate architectural detail added in plastics , fibre - glass resin and brass			0
the courtyards are decorated with 700 stucco plaster panels depicting roman emperors , gods and goddesses and tiny paintings attached to the walls			0
@entity18 was commissioned in 1538 by @entity8 to celebrate the birth of his son , the future @entity76 , and outshine his rival , @entity77 of @entity78			1
the building was so grand that it inspired a foreign visitor to comment : ‘ this which no equal has in art or fame , @entity81 deservedly do @entity18 name			1
’ but by 1690 it had been completely dismantled by @entity56 ’s mistress , who sold its raw materials to pay off her gambling debts			0
the model of @entity18 was based on the research of @entity25 professor @entity30 , who co-ordinated the first excavation on the @entity42 palace ’s site as an undergraduate in 1959			1
rare : just four pictures were ever painted of @entity13 , such as this 1752 watercolour by @entity102			1
it stood for 150 years before it was torn down palace from the past : model maker @entity26 with the replica of @entity8 's ' lost ' @entity18 painstaking : @entity26 with the model			1
the courtyards are decorated with an incredible 700 stucco plaster panels depicting roman emperors , gods and goddesses fit for a king : @entity18 was built for @entity8 , costing £ 24,000 - a fortune in those days he then spent years poring over illustrations , archaeological evidence , written sources , and artefacts from @entity18 , including thousands of original stuccos and statues			1
modeller @entity26 used this research as the basis for his 1:75 scale replica , now on display at the @entity125 , near @entity41 , @entity42			0
professor @entity30 , 74 , said the model was ‘ astonishing ’ , adding : ‘ it has revolutionised the understanding of the nature of @entity18 and leads us to know why it really was regarded by contemporaries as “ that which has no equal ”			2
’ mr @entity26 , who runs modelhouses.co.uk , said : ‘ i hope [ the model ] will bring it to life for people today			0
’ professor @entity30 added : ' of course we do not know everything about the building , so there has been a good deal of properly deployed imagination , but is absolutely as accurate as we could possibly make it			0
' i have been involved in researching @entity18 for my entire adult life and i am absolutely delighted with the model			2
' it is the first time since it was destroyed that people will be able to see the palace and i hope it will lead to some very valuable discussion and further discoveries about @entity18			2
' @entity154 , chairman of the charity friends of @entity18 , said : ' it was a truly magnificent palace - it was an enormous work of art. ' but from around 1680 onwards it was destroyed and the materials were sold for whatever they could get			2
' this is the very first time anything like this model has been attempted			0
we can now see what the palace would have looked like at the time			0
' @entity167 raised £ 20,000 which helped pay for the model			0
detailed : the model maker said he wanted to recreate the sense of theatre in the piece ' educational and ostentatious ' : @entity18 was designed to teach @entity8 's son @entity47 about antiquity and ancient mythology through his surroundings as he grew up meticulous : the original @entity13 was designed in 1538 and was intended as a hunting lodge star of the small screen : a depiction of @entity18 also appeared in the television series @entity184 , starring @entity185 ( pictured )			1

@entity13 considered to be one of the finest architectural *wonders* of the world
' @entity18 ' was named so because there was no other like it
@entity13 stood for 150 years and only four pictures were ever painted of it
