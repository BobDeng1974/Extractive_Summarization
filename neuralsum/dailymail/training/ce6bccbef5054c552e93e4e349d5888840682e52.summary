by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 01:37 est , 25 may 2012 a brave two - year - old girl suffering from a rare killer liver condition has to stay in a cot under bright blue ultra violet light to keep her alive			1
@entity5 must spend 12 hours a day under the bright blue phototherapy rays in her cot to prevent lethal brain damage			1
the toddler , from @entity10 , @entity11 , suffers from @entity12 , a rare condition affecting less than 200 people worldwide			1
baby blue : @entity5 lies in her specially - made cot covered in phototherapy blue lights which help keep her alive			1
family support : @entity5 , who often has disrupted sleep due to the bright blue lights in her cot , is watched by her brother @entity21 she is missing a vital enzyme that breaks down and gets rid of a toxic chemical found in red blood cells , and could die if the chemicals are not broken down			1
to help her live with the condition , @entity5 now spends at least half of every day surrounded by 20 ultra violet blue lights			1
@entity5 's condition means she has dangerously high levels of @entity30 , a naturally occuring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver			1
the uv rays from the blue light affect the bilrubin in @entity5 's system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue			2
by helping to manage bilrubin levels in her body and keep them at an acceptable level , @entity5 is saved from long term damage			2
the lights do mean @entity5 is often unable to sleep at night due and as a result is exhausted during the day and naps for hours			2
this means she misses out on play group and socialising with other toddlers her age			0
@entity5 needs to be kept under the blue lights for at least 12 hours a day to help her body break down a chemical which could otherwise cause her fatal brain damage @entity5 's parents say her condition , which only affects less than 200 people in the world , has been emotionally draining on her whole family @entity5 ’s @entity61 , 37 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , said : ' it ’s a difficult treatment for a two - year - old			1
' she gets very frustrated , and trying to explain to a toddler why we are making her sit in such an uncomfortable environment is so hard			0
' it ’s like a prison camp for her - we feel so guilty forcing her to lie down in her cot for so long but we have no choice			0
' @entity5 ’s mum @entity71 , 25 , said : ' i was so worried when we had the diagnosis and it ’s upsetting that we ca n’t do anything to help her			0
family unit : @entity5 on a rare moment allowed away from the blue lights , with father @entity61 , mother @entity71 and brother @entity21 ' we did n’t know much about the disease as it ’s so rare and it was an emotional time for the whole family			1
' because she is forced to spend so much time in her room , @entity5 has become used to playing alone at night , when the bright blue lights prevent her from sleeping			1
@entity71 gets up to check on @entity5 several times a night , and if her daughter is distressed she tries to distract the tot with toys			0
born in october 2009 , @entity5 was just three days old nurses at @entity89 noticed there may be something wrong			0
they initially thought that @entity5 had jaundice , as her skin had developed a yellow tinge , but reassured @entity71 and @entity61 that it was nothing to worry about			0
after two weeks of phototherapy @entity5 was sent home while waiting for test results			0
it was n’t until the couple received an urgent call from the hospital asking to bring @entity5 back they began to worry it was more serious			0
@entity5 had dangerously high levels of a toxin known as bilirubin , a naturally occuring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver			2
the dangerous levels meant she was forced to stay in hospital for four months while doctors ran further tests and finally diagnosed @entity12 type one			0
phototherapy has helped @entity5 however the treatment becomes less successful after the age of four , because the skin thickens and blocks the light			0
the older little @entity5 gets and the bigger her body becomes , the more time she will be forced to spend having the phototherapy , which could be more than 16 hours a day			1
this means a liver transplant is likely for the toddler , who is due to under - go preliminary tests next month at @entity129 , and @entity61 is to be tested to see if he is a match			0
fighting to stay alive : the younger will have to be kept under the blue lights until she is old enough to have a liver transplant unusual : @entity135 's parents say they hope the blue lights she is subjected to wo n't affect what they want to be a ' normal childhood ' @entity61 said : ' it ’s very painful for both of us - we obviously do n’t want her to miss out on having a normal childhood			1
' we do n’t know what will happen when she gets to school age , as she ’s so tired during the day			0
' @entity5 ’s liver consultant , doctor @entity146 at @entity129 , said : ' @entity5 ’s unconjugated bilrubin level has continually increased and is around the 300 mark currently			2
' we would expect a normal level to be between 5 and 20			0
' anything over 450 means there is a high risk of severe brain damage , and fitting			2
' ' i ’ve worked here for 20 years , and in this time have seen only a handful of children with @entity5 ’s condition - around half a dozen cases			2
' @entity5 has n’t shown any signs brain damage , as the phototherapy has ensured her bilirubin levels have been kept below the high risk level , but the family are aware of the risks and are looking into a liver transplant			1

@entity5 must spend half of every day under lights to keep her alive
she suffers from rare liver condition affecting just 200 worldwide
