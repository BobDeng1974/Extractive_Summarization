an extreme marathon runner may be forced to close her animal sanctuary after an airline charged her thousands of pounds to rebook her flight when she got trapped in @entity5 while fund - raising			1
@entity6 , 44 , had taken part in a 25 - mile race in -20c blizzards - and set a world record - before she discovered her flight could not take off because of bad weather			1
she says that despite having paid @entity13 £ 5,700 for return flights to @entity15 , they charged her nearly £ 6,400 to rebook after she and her mother missed their connecting flight			1

now ms @entity6 says the future of her @entity38 sanctuary hangs in the balance as she no longer has any money to compete in any more fund - raising marathons and will not be able to feed the animals			1
ms @entity6 , who has run eight extreme marathons on seven continents in the past year , said : ' i ’ve barely enough money to see out next month			1
' i only raised around £ 3,000 from sponsorship and the new flights cost double that			1
if i ca n’t find any more money soon i will have to close the doors which will devastate me as it ’s all i have worked for			1
' i ca n’t believe they would be so cruel and heartless			2
i only run the marathons for the animals			2
it was one of the harshest things i ’ve done and now it looks like it was all for nothing			0
' @entity13 has no heart			2
they are literally taking food out of the mouths of desperate animals			0
' ms @entity6 says it costs her and her partner , @entity25 , 49 , £ 10,000 a month to run the sanctuary , where they have 22 dogs , 53 horses , 82 pigs , 50 cats , 40 sheep , goats , three cows and assorted chicken , geese and ducks			1
ms @entity6 , who runs marathons to pay the sanctuary 's bills , has even completed the @entity83 , right ms @entity6 , who lost her right kneecap to a cancerous tumour when she was a teenager and who was nominated for the @entity88 prize in 2012 , turned to sponsored running to bring in money for her sanctuary			1
she won the @entity92 for her age category in 2010 , has completed the notorious @entity95 desert race , and now has the world record for being the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent after completing the @entity101 marathon , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 desert , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity5 marathons			1
in november she completed her fifth marathon in eleven weeks , becoming the fastest female to finish the @entity110 in record time			0
but treacherous weather moved in , cutting the competitors off from the outside world , and they spent the next week stuck in tents on the ice			0
she said : ' it was really cold and scary as we never knew when we were getting off the ice			0
no - one could rescue us as the weather was so bad			0
' the @entity38 sanctuary is home to 22 dogs , 53 horses , 82 pigs , 50 cats , 40 sheep , three cows , goats and fowl her travel company contacted @entity13 to explain ms @entity6 ' predicament , and she expected to be given discounted tickets because of the unusual and unavoidable situation			1
but to her astonishment they said they would sell her tickets for a replacement flight , for £ 6,400 , to cover the difference in fares plus a penalty for changing her flight details			2
ms @entity6 had to hand over all her sponsorship cash and more to get home as she needed to return to the @entity144 to care for her animals			1
she said : ' i have to travel business class to lie my knee out after running because i have no kneecap and a knee joint replacement			0
the pain is too much otherwise			0
' i could n’t believe they wanted everything i had made : all my sponsors ' monies and more			0
' they had no compassion for what i had been through			0
' since then the airline has offered her £ 1,200 , but are refusing to refund the full amount			0
a spokesman for @entity13 said : ' we became aware of the situation after she contacted us in december			2
we then offered to waive extra charges applied to the booking as well as donation of £ 1,000 towards her charity			0
' we are deeply sympathetic to the problems encountered by @entity173 , but we did accept two bookings in business class in good faith			0
' we responded in similar good faith after we heard about her particular case with a donation to her charity , but it is normal practice for the cost of any delays to be covered by a good insurance travel policy			0
' we hope mrs @entity6 will accept our donation and continue to wish her well			2
' to donate and help @entity6 save her sanctuary go to @entity188			2
