new mothers may be told that they will be back to ' normal ' within six weeks of giving birth , but a new study has found that most women take much longer to recover			1
dr @entity4 , of @entity5 , interviewed women two to three weeks , three months and six to seven months after they had given birth to gain a unique insight into postnatal recovery			1
she concluded that it takes a year to recover from childbirth			0
her study also revealed significant dissatisfaction amongst new mothers with postnatal services			1
still recovering : a @entity5 study has found that it takes a year - not six weeks - to get over childbirth ( file image ) the new mothers dr @entity4 spoke to said that the six week recovery time was a ' fantasy '			1
many were disappointed by the six week check , which all mothers receive from either their midwife or their gp			1
some did not receive a physical examination , and others were not told whether or not their bodies had recovered yet			0
the psychological effects can also take much longer to recover from			0
dr @entity4 's study found that hospital wards can have a negative impact on women â€™s ability to recoup and celebrate the birth of their child because of the constant stream of visitors and the unfamiliar rules and regulations			0
helping new mothers adapt to having a baby in the home has also changed a lot over the years			1
in the past women were shown how to perform tasks such as baby bathing and were only discharged from hospital when they were ready			0
now women can go home as soon as six hours after childbirth and many feel they are just ' left to get on with it '			0
additional pressure : @entity55 went back to week just two weeks after she almost died during childbirth dr @entity4 said : ' the research shows that more realistic and woman - friendly postnatal services are needed			1
' women feel that it takes much longer than six weeks to recover and they should be supported beyond the current six to eight weeks after birth			2
' however , government funding cuts and a national shortage of midwives means that postnatal services will only face further challenges			0
the midwifery profession must raise the status of postnatal care as any further erosion can only be bad for women and their children			0
' the @entity73 welcomed the research			1
@entity75 , @entity76 at the @entity73 told @entity77 : ' we are very aware that the postnatal period has always been a bit of a fairy tale			1
' we are often not able to see women as much as we would like to			0
community midwives may be able to help at home but not always , and mothers do not stay in hospital for very long after childbirth any more			2
' women do suffer ill - health , which involves back ache and feeling tired			2
they could be seen as minor problems , but they are not minor for new mums			0
' the physical recovery is , of course , just one side of the story			0
women also need to make the psychological transition to being a mother - which is even tougher for those who were working before giving birth			0
many feel the pressure to get back on their feet soon after childbirth			2
and seeing celebrities like @entity55 looking fantastic just weeks after almost dying during childbirth must be ' very , very frustrating ' , @entity107 said			1
she added that recent studies have shown that women will put up with a lot of discomfort after childbirth because they think that it is normal			2
the @entity73 of @entity117 is conducting its own studies to see how they can make sure that discomfort is not the norm .			1

*official* view is that new mothers should be back to ' normal ' in six weeks
@entity73 says seeing celebrity mothers ' looking fantastic ' must add to the frustration
