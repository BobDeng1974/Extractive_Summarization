he claimed he had been ' role playing ' and mr @entity67 said there was no evidence he had tried to meet the people he was chatting to			0
the court was told that it had n't been possible for police to trace the people @entity0 had spoken to in the chatroom			1
mr @entity67 added ' the prosecution say this case involves a serious breach of trust by reason of his position as a @entity1 reverend			2
' as a member of the clergy there is a higher degree of trust placed in him by members of the public , especially vulnerable members of the public , such as children			0
' his clear motivation was to obtain sexual gratification by discussing with vulnerable children paedophiliac sexual matters			0
' the court was told the true identities of the people @entity0 was talking to in the chat room would never be known , but he said : ' the clear inference to be drawn from the chat logs is that the defendant must have believed he was communicating with children , as he now accepts			1
' @entity212 , defending , said @entity0 had been suspended from his post as vicar of @entity55 in january 2013 - the day after his arrest - and ' in all likelihood ' he would be dismissed			1
he told the court that @entity0 had got into the habit of surfing the internet in the evenings and going into chat rooms , some of which were devoted to ' explicit topics			1
' ' what we are dealing with is a man with a deeply unhealthy tendency to be aroused by children engaging in sexual activity			0
passing sentence , judge @entity230 told @entity0 had police been able to trace those people receiving his chat logs , then he could have faced the much more serious charges of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity			1
' you have let down all those who looked up to you as the holder of a respected office			0
