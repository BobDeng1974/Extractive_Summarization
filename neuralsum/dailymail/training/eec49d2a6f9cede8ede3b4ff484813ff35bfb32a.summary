@entity3 football will soon be dying if it does not overcome its deep - rooted structural problems , @entity1 president @entity0 said on friday			1
' we are in progressive decline , ' he told a shareholders ' meeting in @entity9			1
' @entity3 football will soon be dying if it is unable to face up to a double challenge : on the domestic front the fans have to fill up the stadiums , and abroad the challenge of a truly global market			1
' @entity17 ( r ) wins the ball while playing for @entity1 , but @entity3 football is not what it used to be @entity1 president says structural limits are in danger of destroying @entity23 ' @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 have overtaken us in any number of criteria , revenue , sustainability of the business , sporting results , the value of their stadium and the @entity37 ranking , ' he said			1
' today , we are struggling to defend fourth place from @entity39 , ' he added , referring to the coefficients which determine how many places each country is allocated in the @entity43 and @entity44			0
' our main competitors @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 have clearly moved ahead of us , ' said @entity0			2
' no @entity3 club is in a state where they can grow at that rhythm , the sign of the structural limits which affect our football			0
' ' ten years ago , @entity23 generated almost the same receipts as the @entity58 , a little less than @entity59 and almost a third of the @entity61			1
then , we were a tortoise , now we are a shrimp			0
' no @entity3 side has won the @entity43 since @entity67 's ( c ) @entity66 in 2010 no @entity3 team has progressed beyond the @entity43 quarter - finals since @entity66 won the trophy in 2010 and there has been an exodus of big - name players , culminating in @entity75 's departure from @entity76 two years ago			2
nowadays , @entity23 teams tend to attract players who have fallen out of favour at bigger clubs , such as @entity1 forward @entity81 and @entity76 's @entity82 , or young foreign players hoping to use it as a springboard to another league			1
@entity1 are the only @entity23 club who own their own stadium while others play in often dilapidated municipally - owned arenas			2
star draw @entity75 left @entity23 to play for @entity92 in @entity93 out of favour stars like @entity82 ( @entity95 ) and @entity81 have stepped down from the @entity61 @entity0 said the election of @entity97 as @entity3 federation president in august was another sign of the problems			1
@entity97 , 71 , was chosen despite referring to @entity102 players as ' banana eaters ' in a speech and has been banned from any @entity37 - related activity for six months by @entity108 soccer 's governing body over his remarks			0
' his election has ignored the indications of footballers , coaches , referees and a substantial part of @entity117 , ' said @entity0			0
@entity97 has been banned for six months by @entity37 after referring to @entity102 players as ' banana eaters ' ' it was a defeat for many people and a victory for some crafty characters , whose consensus was born in a time from long ago			0
' i am convinced that the conservative forces in @entity3 football , which seem to prevail at the moment to protect small and large special interests and personal incomes , will not be able to stifle those who support the change			0
' an @entity66 statement read : ' @entity66 is saddened to hear that @entity1 president @entity0 has once again attempted to distort the facts and change history			1
unfortunately for him , and for @entity3 football as a whole , 2006 was a disastrous year in which the @entity138 was legitimately awarded to @entity66 by the @entity140 and @entity1 were relegated to @entity141 along with their reputation			2
' those are the facts			0
we will not allow anyone to change them or act as if they did not happen			0
