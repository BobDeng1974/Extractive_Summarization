the aliens are coming and they 've found the perfect landing pad , nestled among the emerald hills of an @entity4 suburb			2
that is , if you choose to believe footage made by one @entity9 spotter who filmed the glowing sky - balls hovering over @entity11 , in southern @entity12			1
but rather than share his discovery with the world straight away , the bashful space twitcher chose to sit on it for four months before posting a video on @entity19			2
aliens coming ? the jerky video , which is without audio , appears to show a string of otherworldly glowing fireballs , drifting slowly across the dusk sky hiding behind the pseudonym @entity28 , the alien enthusiast uploaded the grainy footage , taken on a mobile phone , last month , but claimed to have filmed it in december			1

having spotted the flying objects ion the horizon , the videographer runs frantically into a garden to get a closer look			0
steadying his camera he captures one of the alleged ufos floating in between two semi-detatched houses			0
otherworldly : steadying his camera the videographer captures one of the alleged ufos floating in between two houses , then two more appear one skeptical viewer wrote online : ' no audio			1
this would make some sense , because if a hoaxer has n't planned out all the " ooh " and " ahh " moments in advance , said hoaxer would then have to produce a credible soundtrack ' moments later two more appear followed by more , all flying in formation			0
but his video was met with a barrage of skepticism online , with one viewer writing on website @entity70 : ' no audio			1
this would make some sense , because if a hoaxer has n't planned out all the " ooh " and " ahh " moments in advance , said hoaxer would then have to produce a credible soundtrack , which may or may not be within the scope of his technical repertoire			0
' another wrote on the same site : ' i 'm going to come down hard off the fence and cry " foul "			0
' this event , if real , would surely have drawn not only media coverage , but also other videos from different locations ( how much footage was there of the meteorite ? )			0
concerns : @entity9 expert @entity95 said he wondered if the objects were in fact flares staunch defence : @entity99 @entity28 hit back at the skeptics , declaring , ' i never mentioned aliens			1
i said they are very bright , strange orbs that are @entity104			2
believe what you want to believe , anything is possible ' @entity95 , best - selling author of numerous books that have been made into feature @entity109 's a big city , it 's not dark , they keep on coming [ ... ] very conveniently emerging from the gap between the houses			1
' @entity99 @entity28 reacted , writing on @entity19 : ' i never mentioned aliens			1
' i said they are very bright , strange orbs that are unidentified witch [ sic ] means that i cant even say that they where [ sic ] lanterns because no such detail was seen			2
believe what you want to believe , anything is possible			0
' @entity9 expert @entity95 , best - selling author of numerous books including ' communion , ' a non-fiction account of his perceived experiences with ' non-human entities ' , told the @entity130 : ' i am wondering if these could have been flares			0
' the thing that bothers me about them is that i am seeing that slow falling motion , not like something powered at all			0
i think that they are too large to be fireworks			0
' , including 1987 's @entity140 no. 1 non-fiction book , " communion , " suggests the @entity28 ufos could be sky lanterns or something else .			1
