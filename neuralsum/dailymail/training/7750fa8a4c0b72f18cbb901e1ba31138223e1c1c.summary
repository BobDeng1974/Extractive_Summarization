by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 12:15 est , 8 march 2014 a transgender woman in @entity3 has sued the company behind the popular @entity6 workouts for refusing to let her compete in the female division of its annual fitness competitions			1
the lawsuit brought thursday by @entity11 , 34 , accuses @entity6 of violating her rights under a @entity3 law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity			1
@entity11 's complaint says she was born male but has been living as a woman since she was a teenager and underwent sex reassignment surgery eight years ago			2
the surgery , coupled with the female hormones she takes , satisfied the state 's requirements for her to be recognized as female on her birth certificate and other official documents			1
' they said she has an advantage over other women because of the sex she was born with , and that is completely untrue , scientifically , ' @entity37 said , noting that the @entity52 and other sports governing bodies allow athletes who have undergone surgery , taken hormones and secured legal recognition to compete in the category that corresponds to their affirmed gender			1
@entity6 's general counsel , @entity61 , would not comment on the lawsuit , which seeks $ 2.5 million in damages			0
@entity61 directed @entity0 to a @entity6 online discussion board , where he posted that @entity11 had never supplied medical documents to back up her assertion that she was a woman			2
he also dismissed @entity37 's suggestion that transgender athletes are engaged in a struggle as valid as the one black baseball players waged to be accepted in the major leagues			2
' the fundamental , ineluctable fact is that a male competitor who has a sex reassignment procedure still has a genetic makeup that confers a physical and physiological advantage over women , ' @entity61 wrote in a letter to @entity37 that 's linked to the discussion board			1
' that @entity11 may have felt herself emotionally , and very conscientiously , to be a woman in her heart , and that she ultimately underwent the legal and other surgical procedures to carry that out , can not change that reality			0
' @entity6 argues that @entity11 has a psychological advantage over women because she was a man even though @entity11 is dissatisfied with @entity6 , the fitness company is talking about having it 's own transgender competition if enough transgender come fporward @entity61 said @entity6 may create a separate division for transgender athletes if enough step forward to compete			1
' our decision has nothing to do with " ignorance " or being bigots - it has to do with a very real understanding of the human genome , of fundamental biology , that you are either intentionally ignoring or missed in high school , ' he said			0
@entity6 is headquartered in @entity105 , but its founder , @entity6 , launched it in @entity107 , @entity108 in the late 1990s			0
the company has 7,000 affiliate gyms around the world where classes offer an intense , military - style mix of weight - lifting , core conditioning and cardio exercises , according to its website			0
individuals and teams compete every year in the timed @entity44 to determine who can complete the most repetitions of various exercises			0
