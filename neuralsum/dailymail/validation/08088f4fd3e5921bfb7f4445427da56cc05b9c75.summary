@entity2 will be one of the ' awkward squad ' asking searching questions if he is elected as @entity7 's @entity6 vice-president , @entity1 chairman @entity0 has claimed			1
@entity8 , the former @entity9 chief executive , is standing against @entity11 ' @entity10 for the position , which is being elected by @entity14 's 54 members at its congress in @entity16 on tuesday			1
@entity0 , who has made clear his opposition to @entity6 president @entity18 continuing in the position , said @entity8 would act as a counter-balance to the ' acolytes ' on @entity6 's executive committee			1
the @entity1 chairman said : ' @entity2 will be the sort of person who will do the job as a @entity6 executive committee member properly			1
he will not be afraid of asking appropriate questions - in fact perhaps @entity6 needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions			2
' he has a strong background in finance so if there are financial questions he will know what to ask and what to look for			0
@entity2 , pictured with sir @entity40 in 2011 , is running for @entity7 's @entity6 vice-president ' there is a feeling that there have been too many acolytes and not enough people asking difficult questions and ensuring that decisions are taken in a transparent , ethical and business - like manner			1
' @entity50 ( @entity14 president ) was very keen for @entity2 to stand for the position and to represent @entity14 on the @entity6 executive committee			1
' @entity8 himself admits that change can not happen overnight			2
he said : ' i aim to use my skills in football around the table and work with my @entity14 colleagues to have a greater say and influence in how it operates			0
in terms of votes it 's quite an important block			0
' in areas like transparency and decision - making , it 's not going to happen overnight and it 's arguable whether it will happen unless there is a president change			0
' my personal view is that it needs a change at the top to ensure that the required changes take place			0
i 'm not naive enough to think i can change things overnight			0
' @entity1 chairman @entity0 claimed that @entity8 would not be afraid of asking appropriate questions the @entity81 has claimed its @entity83 counterparts have reneged on a deal agreed in 2011 which would see a @entity86 nominee replace @entity88 's @entity87 as @entity6 vice-president			1
@entity8 said the agreement became void after @entity6 reforms , which saw the @entity7 @entity6 vice-presidency elected by all @entity14 members instead of just the four home nations			1
he added : ' if there was a deal , that then changed after the reforms			0
it may be semantics but it previously was the @entity7 vice-president of @entity6			2
now it 's @entity14 electing a @entity6 vice-president			2
' we ( the @entity1 ) very clearly took the view , as did @entity14 , that the 54 countries of @entity14 will determine that person and i think that makes sense			2
it 's more democratic to have that person selected by all 54 countries			0
if there had been that agreement , if it had n't been torn up , then obviously it would be the @entity86 turn			0
