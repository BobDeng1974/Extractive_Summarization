@entity0 admits he does not know what the future holds for @entity4 basketball and thinks funding cuts have left the sport at the point of no return			1
the 29 - year - old , who signed for the @entity9 in july , has twice been named an @entity11 all - star and turned out for @entity12 the @entity13			2
it was following the @entity15 that @entity16 announced basketball would no longer receive funding - with the belief that the team would struggle to win medals in the @entity22			1
concerned look : @entity0 thinks basketball in the @entity4 is close to folding due to funding cuts by @entity16 in response to the news , with @entity29 deciding against an appeal , @entity0 has set up his own academy in partnership with @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 with the aim to produce elite basketball players			1
but , as defeat to @entity39 last week meant @entity12 can no longer qualify for @entity40 2015 , @entity0 admits the future appears bleak			1
' we are very close , ' he said at when asked if the sport was close to folding in the @entity4			1
' at this point i do n't know what is next , we just have to wait and see what the plan is			0
i really do n't know the reason for it			0
eyes on the prize : @entity0 was speaking at the launch of his own basketball academy ' people are judging us by the @entity57 but people are not judging it by what it took to get to the @entity57			1
' everyone just wanted to show up and watch but they did n't watch the growth of the game from the level we were in on day one to the point where we reached the @entity57			0
' you then have six games where you are judged and all of a sudden everything you have done in five or six years is judged within those games			0
' it is just bad timing			0
funding has a lot to do with it - i think guys are now questioning if the team is not committed to us then why are we so committed			1
joint venture : @entity0 has created the academy in partnership with @entity33 , in order to produce elite @entity4 players ' we have come a long way since day one and i think that has been taken away from us			1
' no one has appreciated where we have to come to reach the level and compete with all of these teams			0
to go back to nothing is very disappointing and we have got to keep believing in ourselves			0
' @entity0 reckons basketball is a sport which can give youngsters from underprivileged backgrounds the chance to flourish and the progression made over a short period of time should count for something			1
he said : ' people should look back at how far we have come along and what we have done to be here			0
' this is an opportunity to really get a lot of young kids off the street and have them focus on a sport - a sport that gives an opportunity to many , not just to a few			0
bigger picture : @entity0 says basketball is a sport that gives underprivileged youngsters an opportunity to flourish ' they could use this as a tool to become something and basketball also takes up a lot of your time so instead of wasting time they would be using their time valuably			1
' i went to the @entity125 and had an opportunity to play basketball in school and it gave me a chance to divide my time right			2
' the kids here ( at the @entity133 ) can focus on their school but also have the opportunity to be coached by a great coach and put in the hours into basketball			2
' next up for @entity0 is to start his career with the @entity9 and , although he is aware that he will be expected to replace the outgoing @entity140 , he wants to be his own man			1
pastures new : @entity0 is looking forward to replacing @entity140 at the @entity9 next season ' that is what it is , ' he added			2
' people are going to talk about @entity140 and what he has done in the past			0
for myself , i have got to be able to understand that i have to be the best i can be			0
' my whole thing is taking my own picture and putting out there what i can do and it is up to everyone else to mix and match			0
' for me , it is all about the team i 'm playing for and the guys i 'm playing with the goals we are trying to accomplish			2
