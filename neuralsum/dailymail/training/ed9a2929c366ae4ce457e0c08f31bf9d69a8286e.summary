@entity0 showed class and tremendous resolve under pressure on thursday night night as he moved into the semi-finals of the @entity5			1
exactly a year after he became world champion , the 25 - year - old progressed into the final four with a thrilling 5 - 2 victory over @entity9 , the ninth - ranked player			1
but it could easily have gone the distance as the @entity12 , who had trailed 3 - 0 at one point , missed a dart to level at 3 - 3			2
@entity15 , who banks £ 60,000 for reaching this stage , may have hit a superb 170 finish to secure the win but he acknowledged it had been a hard - fought match			2
‘ i was under pressure			2
i was a bit nervous			2
i thought to myself , “ this ca n’t happen , can it ? ” the 170 finish to win was such a big relief for me			2
‘ i had a 106 average at the end but i am not happy with my performance			0
i can do a lot better			0
i can improve to win this tournament			0
if you want to be a winner , you ca n’t be scared of who you play next			0
that is the most important thing			0
’ by his own admission , @entity15 started sluggishly in the opening rounds at @entity29			1
he was far from lethargic here early on			0
back to his rapid - fire best , @entity15 recorded a three - dart average of 112.59 in the opening set			2
these were the first sets that @entity9 had dropped this tournament after winning 11 straight in three matches			1
@entity15 had raced into a 3 - 0 lead but was pegged back to 3 - 2 by @entity9 yet the 47 - year - old , from @entity58 , is renowned on the @entity27 circuit as a battler and those qualities came to the fore in the fourth and fifth sets			1
a memorable comeback and a massive upset were on the cards			0
@entity9 had a chance to square it at 3 - 3 with an 81 finish — his third dart vibrated the wire of the bullseye — but he was then punished by the world no 1 , who moved remorselessly through the gears			1
@entity9 had an average of 101.49 and he was philosophical about defeat			1
‘ that was n’t good enough , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity0 played well , and produced some good finishes			1
that is the name of the game			0
i ’m not disappointed because i have got this far			0
’ the man who will be trying to prevent @entity15 from reaching a third successive final will be @entity84			1
the 44 - year - old beat fellow countryman @entity85 5 - 1			1
@entity84 said : ‘ @entity0 is the world champion			1
the pressure is on me			0
he will need to prove he is the better player ... because i will be right behind him			0
