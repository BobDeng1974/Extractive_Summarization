they were young men - aged 17 , 18 and 20 - when they were sentenced to death in 1975 for a crime they did n't commit			1
now three childhood friends who were wrongly imprisoned for nearly 40 years have sat down together for their first proper interview since being exonerated in november , discussing how they are coping living in the ' new world ' , the lives they missed out on living , and the first thing they did after being freed			1
@entity12 , now 58 - who holds the @entity14 record for serving the longest time for a wrongful conviction , after 39 years , three months and nine days in prison - and @entity18 , 60 , walked free last year after the sole witness in their case confessed his testimony had been ' all lies '			1
@entity23 , 57 , @entity18 's brother , was released on parole in 2003 , after all three sentences were commuted to life after a @entity28 ruling in 1978			1
' we all have scars that we are never going to be able to recover from , ' @entity12 told @entity31			1
' that 's something that happened			2
everyone is going through something in their life			2
' the men were convicted of the may 19 , 1975 , murder of @entity58 businessman @entity57 , who was attacked , robbed and shot to death			1
the trio had walked passed the crime scene and inquired what had happened , and not long after became the prime suspects			2
they were locked up , and believed everything would be ' straightened out ' , but were soon facing trial for @entity57 ' murder			1
the prosecutions case was based on the testimony of a 12 - year - old , @entity70 , who said he saw the murder			2
there was no physical evidence linking the three to @entity57			1
@entity70 , now 52 , eventually recanted his testimony , saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details about the case			2
changing his account in 2013 , he said : ' all the information was fed to me - i do n't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime ' , @entity79 reported			2
revisiting the scene : during the interview , the men returned to the street corner where @entity57 was killed in 1975			1
they had walked by the scene , and quickly became suspects a lifetime ago : @entity94 businessman @entity57 was attacked , robbed and shot to death on this @entity58 corner 40 years ago , and these three men were wrongly convicted of his murder all three men were officially exonerated on november 21 , 2014			1
the ruling released @entity12 and @entity18			1
and it allowed them to be reunited - finally - with @entity23 , who has changed his name to @entity104			1
according to @entity31 , a recent ruling by a judge that acknowledged all three were wrongly convicted makes each of them eligible for up to $ 40,000 from the state for every year were in prison			0
that makes @entity12 , the longest - serving , eligible for over $ 1.5 million			1
but money ca n't exactly make up for the lives that were stolen from each of them			0
they each missed important funerals , and the experiencing of being involved with their families			0
but above all , they missed the chance to have families of their own			0
' whatever we lost is gone ... we ca n't ever recapture it , ' @entity12 said			1

' however the first thing the men did was go to lunch together at @entity158			1

i 'm out ! @entity12 walks smiling out of the jail after his sentence was quashed			1
he said he was on ' an emotional high ' from being freed he now claims detectives talked him into testifying , then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury			0

@entity18 embraced his brother @entity129 , who changed his name to @entity104 , as he walked out of the courthouse			1
all he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner			0

you 'll be all right			0
i ai n't never going to let you go			0
' @entity12 and his lawyers planned to celebrate friday at a hotel			1
