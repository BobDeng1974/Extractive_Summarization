by @entity0 a male @entity2 club promoter has landed in hot water for allegedly telling a woman trying to plan a friend ’s bachelorette party not to bring ' whales ' and ' hippos ' to the sin city hotspot			1
the exchange between a host at @entity13 nightclub at @entity14 named @entity15 and a @entity17 resident named @entity18 went viral this week when the @entity20 blog @entity19 posted screenshots of the text messages online			1
@entity18 explained that she contacted the club promoter asking to arrange a comp - or a complimentary table - at the club for the bride and her 14 friends			1
vegas standards : a promoter at @entity30 has been suspended for telling a woman organizing a bachelorette party that she can not bring any patrons who look like ' hippos ' or ' whales ' ' in the past , clubs / promoters / hosts have tended to go out of their way to provide a great experience for the bride , and the group , and occasionally throw in a few extras to make the evening special			2
this is why i asked if it was possible to get a comped table. , ’ @entity18 told @entity19			0
when the woman reached out to the club host asking to make her friends ' upcoming party extra special , the man demanded pictures of all 15 invitees			2
when @entity18 replied that she did not have the guests ' photos , @entity15 wrote back to her saying that the club is not going to offer ' comped ' tables ' to random girls			1
' ' then the club will be filled with hippos , ' the host allegedly texted			0
' that 's not what @entity13 is about			0
' he later reiterated his point , saying , ' we do n't comp anything ugly			0
' @entity18 retorted by writing to @entity15 the promoter that she does not think the bachelorette party will have a problem booking a complimentary table in @entity2			1
' other clubs yes , but not at the # 1 club in @entity76 ! ' @entity15 boasted			0
the two continued firing off text messages arguing over the photos of the would - be guests , with the promoter repeatedly pressing @entity18 to give him her and the other women 's @entity82 or @entity85 accounts			2
@entity18 noted that it would be a waste of her time to gather 15 photos of people she did not even know , to which the opinionated @entity13 promoter replied : ' so if you do n't know them , how do you know they ’re not whales or hippos ? ' the self - appointed arbiter of female beauty opined that since the group is coming from @entity102 , where according to @entity15 ' girls do n't go to the gym , ' it would be hard to find 15 women who are all ‘ 9 - 10s			1
' at the conclusion of their back - and - forth , @entity15 invited @entity18 to come to the club with her bridal party pals anyway and then ' ditch the whales ' once she was inside			2
only for @entity111 : @entity15 the club host boasted that the no 1 club in @entity76 is not for ' random girls ' and said that women from @entity102 likely do not go to the gym the written exchange , which @entity18 shared with @entity19 , was accompanied by screenshots of what @entity15 has described as @entity13 's policy on complimentary tables			1
male patrons who wish to book a table for a bachelor party are not required to submit their photos , but they must pay a minimum of $ 4,000 , according to the alleged rules of the establishment			2
in the aftermath of the outage sparked by the offensive text messages , the management of @entity13 released a statement distancing itself from the rogue promoter , @entity129 reported			0
‘ @entity137 prides ourselves on providing our guests with an unmatched level of customer service , ’ said @entity136 , president of @entity137			0
‘ the statements made by this individual , who has since been terminated from the company , do not represent our corporate policy or our views			0
this type of attitude and communication is totally unacceptable , and while we can not control every piece of communication between our thousands of staff and guests , we will not tolerate anything less than impeccable customer service			0
’ the nightclub later clarified that @entity15 the host has not been outright fired , but rather suspended pending an investigation into the incident .			1

@entity18 , from @entity17 , contacted a @entity13 @entity2 host named @entity15 asking to book a complimentary table for a bachelorette party
the promoter *insisted* to see photos off all 15 invitees saying that he can not give a ' comp ' table to ' random girls '
@entity174 said since the guests were coming from @entity102 , they were likely out of shape and not ' nines and tens ' on the beauty scale
the nightclub has since suspended the host pending an investigation
