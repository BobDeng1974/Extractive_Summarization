@entity0 's decision to disappear from public view also comes as criticism for his role in saturday 's accident that killed 20 - year - old racer @entity21 at the @entity68 has heated up			1
many fans blame @entity0 , 43 , for the death even though @entity21 had walked along the track to confront the older driver after being forced off the track			1
even in his home state opinions are divided			0

' if it was an accident , and we prefer to believe that 's the case , he will be able to live with himself , although the memory will remain with him always			0
driven : @entity21 was on the darkened dirt track @entity68 in @entity85 , @entity86 , trying to confront @entity0 following a bump with @entity0 one lap earlier when he was fatally hit by @entity89 ' if he was overcome by rage and did less than his best to avoid the 20 - year - old @entity91 , he will have to live with that messy lie the rest of his natural life			1
' @entity0 's only comment on the tragedy was to issue a statement on sunday saying : ' there are n’t words to describe the sadness i feel about the accident that took the life of @entity21 it ’s a very emotional time for all involved …			1
my thoughts and prayers are with his family , friends and everyone affected by this tragedy			0
' but even that statement was attacked by @entity21 's aunt @entity111 who sarcastically tweeted the message ' thanks for thinking of our family @entity0 when you decided to be a d — k ! ' authorities are looking at two separate videos of the incident taken by fans at @entity68			2

i seen @entity138 as day			0
nobody else ran into him , either			0
' shuttered : @entity0 ives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom - built 6 - bedroom , 12 - bath log cabin compound outside @entity9 , @entity10 , the town in which he grew up			1
but sources say he has decamped ' with friends ' sheriff @entity146 of @entity147 , which covers @entity68 , said no criminal charges are pending against three - time @entity149 champion @entity0 , but investigations were continuing			1
he said @entity0 had been cooperating with authorities , @entity0 , whose hot - headeness on the racetrack has brought him legions of both devoted fans and intractable foes , lives in a 15,700 sq. ft. custom - built 6 - bedroom , 12 - bath log cabin compound outside @entity9 , @entity10 , the town in which he grew up			1
the website of the company that built the house on @entity163 says : ' from the minute one pulls up to the log home and parks under the porte cochére , they will notice the immense size of the home accented by a custom three tiered retaining wall constructed of large natural stone boulders to the west			0
a stream and pond tying into a fresh water fish aquarium will wrap around the great room to a two - story picture window with a view of @entity0 's lake , all of which allow @entity0 to enjoy his passion for nature year round			2
the lower level is designed to entertain guests through various eye catching amenities			0
as one descends down the curved log staircase encased by a natural rock wall , they will enter a large bar room with billiards , shuffle board , numerous televisions , and two racing display cases flanking an @entity198 car hung on the wall			0
on low key nights , @entity0 and his guests may prefer to watch a movie in the media room or play poker in the card room			2
' but @entity0 — who has never married and has no children — is now staying far from the compound , which also includes a bowling alley and elevator			2
cabin in the woods : this is a ' small ' guest house on @entity0 's property			2

' it is still an emotional time for all involved , @entity0 included			2
' he is grieving and grief does n't have a timetable			0
' @entity0 's future could still be in doubt if his sponsors - including @entity229 , @entity230 and car dealership @entity227 - decide to abandon him to keep their names away from controversy			2
all are monitoring the situation			0
' even if he ’s cleared of any wrongdoing , it ’s uncertain how many corporations would want a grinning @entity0 pitching their products after this sort of tragedy , ' @entity235 reports			2
many racing fans are attacking him for his actions			0
on @entity0 's own @entity248 page , a man identifying himself as ' @entity246 ' wrote : ' watch the video ... you hear @entity0 rev his engine ... it looks like homicide			0
' another fan , @entity254 , added : that was no mistake , that was @entity0 being his usual bullheaded self and was n't gone let some kid show him up and it cost @entity21 his life and @entity0 his career			1
' but he also got plenty of support			0
@entity263 wrote : ' @entity264 , please do not listen the negative people out there , you did nothing wrong , you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
get back in the car and race , put this behind you and move on			0
' and @entity274 added : lesson is - do n't run around on a live track			0
