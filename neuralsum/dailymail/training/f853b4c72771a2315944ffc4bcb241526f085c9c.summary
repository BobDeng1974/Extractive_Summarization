the @entity1 should adapt to a @entity3 model in the workplace in order to halt global warming , a study says			1
by working less hours per week and take longer vacations the @entity1 people could reduce carbon emissions , think tank center for @entity11 and research claim			1
if the ‘ @entity3 ’ working model was to be adopted in the @entity1 , it could reduce up to 50 per cent of the addressable global temperature rise expected by 2100			1
time off for the climate : @entity1 can help fight climate change by taking on the ' @entity3 model ' of working less hours per week there is a documented link between a shorter work week and lower levels of carbon emissions , which is at the centre of the research by the @entity27 think tank			1
as productivity grows in western civilisations , as well as developing countries , the study analyses the gains from the resulting increase in consumption versus the possible loss as a result of fewer working hours			2
it concludes that a developing country expanding at a high rate should chose the ‘ @entity3 ’ model in order to keep greenhouse emissions at bay			0
it adds that an @entity1 switch to the ' @entity3 ' system could have a significant impact on global warming			2
the research paper estimates that a change could ‘ eliminate about one - quarter to one - half ’ of global warming which is not already in the atmosphere , and would have particular effect if adapted by workplaces that consume high levels of energy , such as factories			0
@entity60 time : by taking more vacations , @entity1 families can help the environment ( file photo ) travelling time : the reduction in emissions would mainly derive from lowering the productivity in workplaces which use a lot of energy , such as in factories , but also by less commuting ‘ the relationship between [ shorter work and lower emissions ] is complex and not clearly understood , but it is understandable that lowering levels of consumption , holding everything else constant , would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , ’ the study ’s author , economist @entity74 , writes			1
he concludes that some climate change is inevitable , but adds that the amount of which is ‘ very much under our control ’			0
‘ in addition to reducing emissions by other means , a significant reduction in climate change is possible by choosing a more @entity3 response to productivity gains rather than following a model more like that of the @entity1			2
’ in the ‘ best case scenario ’ @entity1 would begin working about 0.5 per cent less each year , starting with a 10 - hour reduction in 2013 , which could prevent an increase of up to 1.3 degrees			1
‘ we can get a similar amount of work done as productivity and technology improves , ’ @entity74 says			0
‘ it 's something we have to decide as a country — there are economic models in which individuals get to decide their hours and are still similarly productive as they are now			0
’ however the study does not take into consideration what people would do with the increased leisure time , and although it says fewer working hours will help , it could be cancelled out if it would mean an increase in holidays with extensive travelling .			0

shorter hours and more vacations could help the environment
by working 0.5 per cent less each year , @entity1 can prevent a temperature rise of up to 1.3 degrees
