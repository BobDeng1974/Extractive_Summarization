news travels quickly in football these days , and rumours travel even quicker			0
so it was that @entity4 declared on sunday evening that @entity5 had not stayed at @entity6 to watch @entity7 lose to @entity8 after being excluded from @entity10 ’s squad			1
as it happened , that was quite wrong			0
@entity5 watched with @entity7 defender @entity14 from a private box and then mingled in the players ’ tunnel at full - time			1
another social media whirlwind becalmed by some rather less exciting truths			0
nevertheless , the issue of where @entity5 will be next season , rather than where he was on sunday , remains increasingly pertinent			1
certainly , you would n’t put any decent amount of money on the £ 280,000 - a - week loanee being retained as things stand			2
@entity5 has struggled at @entity7 and there are doubts the striker will remain at @entity6 the @entity7 loanee has scored just three goals in eight starts having joined the club from @entity35 the bald statistics of the @entity38 ’s stay at @entity7 so far read : played ( started ) 8 ; scored : 3			1
with half the season gone already , both of those numbers are going to have to shoot skywards if @entity7 ’s executives are going to press the button on a permanent deal with @entity35 that stands to cost them in excess of £ 40million in transfer fee alone this summer			1
certainly @entity7 manager @entity48 has his own doubts about the 28 - year - old , doubts that he harboured long before he chose to remove him from his squad of 18 after his players ’ final training session at @entity55 on saturday			1
@entity57 revealed back at the start of winter that @entity48 was already wondering about the @entity60 ’ physical durability and , despite a recent return to action after some muscle issues , those reservations remain			0
@entity5 trained on friday but did not feature during the @entity65 ' 1 - 0 defeat at home to @entity8 @entity10 , pictured with @entity5 in september , has had doubts about the striker 's physcial durability 604 - minutes played for @entity7 so far 3 - goals scored and three assists in all competitions 201.3 - minutes per goal			1
@entity74 leads the league on 70.33 £ 40,000 - @entity5 ’s daily wages £ 1.77m - cost of each of his @entity7 goals in wages , not including bonuses ( @entity81 of @entity83 ’s 18 goals has cost @entity84 £ 210,000 in wages ) the @entity86 is increasingly a young man ’s playground , especially for those who want to play no 9			1
@entity5 , sadly , suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last season — the one players fear above all others - and that was always going to plant seeds of doubt in the mind of a coach who , despite his love of attractive , passing football , is pretty much obsessed with the issue of players ’ fitness			1
for his part , @entity5 feels a little hard done by			1
it is not in his nature to complain publicly			0
he knows he has been given a golden opportunity by one of the world ’s biggest clubs when others were put off by the numbers and has n’t given up on life here by any stretch			0
it is understood , though , that the former @entity117 forward feels that he has to do twice as much to impress @entity48 than some others in the @entity7 set - up			1
@entity5 , pictured against @entity120 in the @entity121 , was left bemused by @entity48 ’s continued assertions that he would n’t pick him ‘ until he is fit ' only recently @entity5 was left bemused by @entity48 ’s continued assertions that he would n’t pick him ‘ until he is fit …			1
first he needs to be fit ’			0
as far as he was concerned , he had recovered from the calf injury that side lined him just as he seemed to be getting his @entity7 career off the ground and just could n’t understand why his manager was making such noises			1
on a daily basis , @entity5 has done what he needs to do , and then some			2
those who know him told of a player desperate to impress his manager , desperate to learn to @entity137 football quickly and who has stayed behind for solitary training sessions on a number of occasions in a bid to prepare and acclimatise his body			0
@entity5 has understood quickly that centre forwards in @entity137 must do more than score goals			1
he has seen the way @entity147 plays his football - the areas of the field that he occupies - and has endeavoured to move his own game in that direction			2
@entity5 is desperate to impress his new manager and has stayed behind for solitary training sessions it is difficult , though , if you are not allowed to ease yourself in to the ebb and flow of regular football			2
‘ the manager talks rhythm and confidence but it ’s hard to establish either if you are in and out of the team , ’ said an associate of @entity5 on monday			2
‘ this is part of the problem for @entity5			2
‘ he desperately feels he needs games in order for people to see the best of him			0
‘ that is why he was so stunned to be left out of the squad for sunday			0
’ @entity48 ’s history as a coach tells that he can be merciless when it comes to his treatment of his players			0
it is accepted as a quality			0
at @entity184 first time round , for example , he shunted the great @entity186 @entity185 - the darling of the @entity188 - out on to the wing and when he complained he dropped him			0
known as an obsessive keeper of figures , one key component of @entity48 ’s famous dossiers is , for centre forwards , not just goals but shots on target and assists			2
if those numbers do n’t keep heading north at the required rate then you are in trouble , whoever you are			0
certainly at @entity6 , @entity5 is part of a wider problem			1
@entity48 ’s squad needs a regular goal scorer if it is to go anywhere at all next season			0
@entity147 no longer counts as he plays a withdrawn role while @entity211 will be 32 in august and looks short these days when compared to @entity212 at @entity213 , @entity214 at @entity215 and @entity84 ’s @entity83			0
@entity48 and his club need the next @entity217 and if it ’s not going to be @entity5 then he increasingly looks like being the obvious one to make way .			2

@entity5 has scored three goals in eight starts for @entity7
@entity38 striker is on loan at @entity6 from @entity228 side @entity35
@entity5 will need to score more goals to earn permanent move
the *frontman* 's transfer fee alone would cost @entity7 in excess of £ 40million
