by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 19:11 est , 7 january 2013 the @entity1 yesterday expressed deep concerns over @entity4 ’s plans to overturn centuries - old laws that govern succession to the throne			1
senior bishops share the worries of the @entity10 that legislation to give princesses equal rights to princes in line of succession is rushed , risky , and could lead to unintended constitutional crises			2
concern in the @entity1 centres on the prime minister ’s plan to remove the 312 - year - old ban on members of the @entity23 from marrying @entity24			1
monarch and clergy : the @entity27 with former archbishop of canterbury @entity28 last year			2
the @entity1 yesterday expressed deep concerns over plans to overturn centuries - old laws even though the @entity32 ’s @entity31 stipulates that the monarch must be @entity1 , a @entity24 married to the monarch or an heir to the throne must , if they follow the doctrines of their church , bring his or her children up as @entity24			1
that raises the prospect that an heir to the throne would be raised as a @entity24			1
leading clergy believe the planned changes will bring confusion and complication to the historic rule that the @entity49 or @entity27 must be a member of the @entity1 in order to become its @entity51 on taking the throne			1
reforms that undermine that principle threaten the established status of the @entity1 and could ‘ unpick the constitution ’ , they said			1
former archbishop of @entity58 said yesterday : ‘ the reported concerns of the @entity10 need to be listened to very carefully			2
we must not have any ill - thought - through proposals because of the potential to upset a delicate constitutional balance			2
‘ the government ’s instincts to allow female heirs to succeed are wholly right but to avoid any unintended consequences of the proposals for the @entity1 and the @entity24 there must be much greater consultation and discussion			1
’ officials at @entity73 , where the right reverend @entity74 takes over as @entity57 next month , said there had been talks with ministers over the issue			0
how yesterday 's @entity79 covered the story they also pointed to remarks made by dr @entity28 , who stepped down as archbishop last month , in a little - noticed interview with @entity85 late last year			1
in it dr @entity28 said any heir to the throne would have to be raised in the @entity1 – and not as a @entity24 – which could pose problems if the child had a @entity24 parent			1
dr @entity28 said : ‘ if we ’re quite clear that , so long as the monarch is @entity51 , there needs to be a clear understanding that the heir is brought up in that environment			0
’ prince @entity100 has voiced serious concern about ' rushed ' plans to change ancient laws governing the royal line of succession prince @entity100 is understood to have raised a series of questions over the impact of reforms on the constitutional relationship between @entity111			1
mr @entity4 ’s reforms , drawn up under the supervision of deputy prime minister @entity114 in a @entity115 , will remove the ancient rule of primogeniture that says boys take precedence over girls in line to the throne			1
the law is set to be fast - tracked through @entity124 with minimal debate			2
it will mean that should the @entity128 give birth to a daughter , she will have first claim to succeed to the throne , in preference to any son born later			0
the rules will also remove the requirement , dating to the @entity136 , that the heir to the throne and senior royals do not marry @entity24			1
the issue was given fresh significance by the announcement of the @entity128 's pregnancy the law will , however , keep the @entity136 ’s paragraphs which say the monarch may not be a @entity24 him or herself			1
the changes to allow a daughter of @entity150 and @entity128 to take the throne is widely popular , and @entity24 have long resented the @entity153 discrimination in the 18th century succession law			1
but the cofe leader in the @entity156 , @entity155 the right reverend @entity157 , has previously warned that the 26 bishops in the @entity159 would vote against reforms			0
dr @entity157 said : ‘ if the heir to the throne is brought up as a @entity24 , and therefore , under the present disciplines of the @entity24 , is not able to be in communion with the @entity1 , it effectively renders a @entity24 heir incapable of being the @entity51 of the @entity1 , so clearly that ’s a more complicated issue than it appears at first sight			1
’ he added that any threat to the established status of the @entity1 was something bishops ‘ would have to resist ’			2
the @entity1 ’s most important protestant faction , the reform evangelical group , also indicated its unease yesterday			2
its chairman , @entity178 vicar the reverend @entity179 , said : ‘ i would see a problem if a child was brought up in the @entity24			2
that would threaten to unpick the constitution and unravel the whole basis on which our constitution has been built			0
’ by @entity187 the @entity188 , whose fortune is reckoned at £ 200million the removal of the precedence of boys over girls in line to the throne threatens arguments and upheaval in other families where titles and inheritance are handed down by ancient hereditary principles			0
the reforms would throw a question over the inheritance rights of the @entity10 ’ own @entity207 , which is currently the automatic property of a male heir to the throne			0
a new law must therefore affect the @entity207 and introduce equal rights for girls into its practices			0
but that leaves the question of whether more than 20 other dukedoms may also be compelled to follow the new system			0
the removal of the primogeniture law from the royal succession leaves titled families exposed to legal challenge if they persist with the tradition of male inheritance			0
families which do not opt to follow the new rules for the @entity229 could see their inheritance arrangements tested in the courts , with frustrated daughters and their descendants looking to win a greater share			0
a number of the most prominent aristocratic families may be involved in the process			0
among those affected may be the @entity188 , whose fortune is reckoned at £ 200million			0
the eldest child of @entity242 , the 10th @entity188 , is a girl , 20 - year - old @entity241			1
@entity243 , 11th @entity244 and owner of @entity246 in @entity247 , has three daughters older than the male heir to the title			0
lady @entity251 , eldest daughter of the @entity252 , the country ’s wealthiest aristocrat , is married to prince @entity150 ’s friend @entity255			0
she and her sister are both older than the male heir to the dukedom .			0
