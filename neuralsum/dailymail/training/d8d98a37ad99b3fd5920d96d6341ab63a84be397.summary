by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 09:56 est , 6 august 2013 a dvd cover for a film about an @entity4 girl group has been labelled ' racist and sexist ' for relegating its female stars to the background to give @entity8 actor @entity7 centre stage			1
the original dvd cover for @entity11 features the four singers in prominent positions , with @entity7 - who plays the group 's manager - at the back			1
but on the @entity18 version of the dvd , @entity7 takes centre stage while @entity11 fade into an entirely blue background			1
spot the difference : on the @entity23 dvd cover , left , the @entity11 take centre stage , but in the @entity18 version , seen right , @entity7 dominates the cover while the @entity4 singers fade into a blue background the drastic change saw a petition launched against the ' whitewashed and gender - washed ' cover for the film - which is based on a true story - on social media , a report in @entity29 said			1
@entity37 , who started the online petition , said : ' @entity11 is a wonderful film about four @entity4 women battling against racism and sexism in the entertainment industry of the 1960s			2
' that 's why so many of us were disappointed to see a whitewashed and gender - washed cover that reinforces the problems @entity11 worked so hard to overcome			2
' blogger @entity50 agreed , writing on @entity52 : ' the women are @entity54			0
they are black black black black blackety - black black			0
' oh , and they 're women			0
' more than 10,000 people put their names to the petition , and @entity18 distributor @entity62 has now apologised for the cover			0
the real - life members of @entity11 had also written to the @entity18 civil rights group the @entity65 to ask it to add its support to the campaign			1
the letter on behalf of @entity69 , @entity70 and their cousins @entity71 and @entity74 said : ' as i 'm sure you can appreciate , the treatment of people of colour in @entity23 mirrored much of the trauma to which people in the @entity18 were subjected			0
' that trauma – and much of that treatment – remains alive and well in @entity23 today , as i know it does in the @entity18			0
' ' disappointed ' : the @entity11 tells the tale of four @entity4 women battling against racism and sexism in the entertainment industry in the 1960s @entity62 issued a statement which said it ' regrets any unintentional upset ' , adding that ' new cover art is being considered for future replenishment orders '			2
on the @entity23 dvd the names of the lead actresses ; @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , were given equal billing along with @entity7			0
on the @entity18 cover , only @entity7 's name appears			1
according to the report @entity7 , who was catapulted into the a-list by his role in smash hit comedy bridesmaids , is said to have tweeted that the @entity18 cover was ' misleading , it 's ill - judged , insensitive and everything the film was n't '			1
his tweet is then said to have been deleted .			0
