@entity0 is confident in @entity3 's ability to shine for @entity4 , it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad			1
this has been quite the season for the 21 - year - old , whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any @entity17 striker this term			2
that form has impressed @entity4 boss @entity0 , who has strongly hinted recently that @entity3 will earn a first senior call - up in two weeks ' time			1
@entity4 manager @entity0 is open to the possibility of calling up @entity24 striker @entity3 the @entity24 front man has is a regular in the @entity4 under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club @entity3 was far from his best in the @entity29 final but @entity0 said he thinks the striker is ' ready ' it is not just the @entity24 man vying for a striking berth , though , with a number of other in - form , uncapped players hoping to be involved against @entity36 and @entity37			1
@entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is @entity3 who is the main talking point			2
' he 's in my thoughts of course , he deserves to be , ' @entity0 said , speaking at the @entity48 , which raises funds for national charity , @entity51			1
' he 's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the @entity56 but i know him anyway , he 's done a lot of good work for the under - 21s			1
@entity60 striker @entity39 ( right ) is among the names for a call up to the @entity4 first team @entity64 's @entity40 ( left ) and @entity65 's @entity38 ( right ) have both been in fine scoring form ' what pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play			1
in the past 19 , 20 , 21 - year - olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance			0
now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it			0
' i 'm delighted for him and we 'll see when i select my squad at the end of month if he 's in it			2
' asked whether @entity3 was ready to make the step up to the senior side , @entity0 said : ' he 's ready			1
if he was n't ready he would n't be playing for @entity24 and scoring lots of goals			1
' the question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we 're looking for and is there a space for him ? ' if he comes in then someone 's going to drop out and most forwards we 've got have done quite well in the autumn			0
' but i ca n't include everyone unfortunately			0
it 's not always a question of are they good enough , it 's a question of is there space at this time			0
' however @entity3 is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 look set to be involved in the squad , while @entity108 and @entity109 are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four - month break			1
' i am looking forward to it , we all are , ' @entity0 said			2
' certainly i and my coaching staff are			0
i hope the players are looking forward to it , too			0
' it will be nice to see them again			0
we did plan a little meeting in january but we found another way of staying in touch with them			0
' it will be nice to see them physically again and i hope to see them in as good a shape as i thought they were last autumn			0
' @entity0 was speaking at the @entity48 , which raises vital funds for @entity51 - the only national charity working with seriously ill young adults aged 16 to 40 to fulfil uplifting and unforgettable special days			1

@entity0 thinks @entity3 is ready for an @entity4 senior place
the @entity4 boss *commended* the @entity24 striker 's scoring record
however it remains to be seen if there is room for him in the squad
@entity0 added he is happy young players are getting a chance to play
