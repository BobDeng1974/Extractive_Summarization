police hunting for the gunman accused of shooting dead a corporal at state barracks 29 days ago hope the fall will break his cover			1
since september 12 , @entity6 has evaded 300 troopers , sniffer dogs , helicopters and citizen watch teams after fleeing through the woods of @entity13 's dense @entity12			1
and a shocking new report reveals the large - scale operation is costing agencies more than $ 1.1 million a week			1
but now that it 's getting colder and the leaves are starting to fall , the advantage could soon shift to law enforcement , experts say			1
hopes : lt col @entity23 hopes the change of weather will give them an advantage over @entity6 ( left ) however , officials insist the challenge remains no less daunting as police track an armed suspect - already accused of killing one officer and injuring another - in a wilderness that offers plenty of places to hide			1
' i wish people could understand how hard it is to find people in the woods , ' said @entity41 , who helped track @entity42 , the @entity44 bomber who eluded authorities for years in the woods of western @entity47			0
' it truly is a massive undertaking			0
' the september 12 ambush outside the @entity51 state police barracks killed cpl. @entity52 , seriously wounded trooper @entity53 and touched off a manhunt whose scale and intensity is unrivaled in modern @entity13 history			1
day after day , tactical teams looking for @entity6 creep through the woods around his parents ' home in @entity63 , using sticks and ski poles to prod the dense underbrush			1
dogs sniff for explosives , weapons and ammunition - and any sign of the suspect			0
search : 300 armed troopers have been searching @entity13 's @entity12 since september 12 drastic : the intensity of the manhunt is unrivaled in the state 's history as @entity6 is armed and trained pulled out all the stops : sniffer dogs and helicopters were among the many measures brought in to find him a month after the attack , residents have grown accustomed to the constant police presence in this rugged corner of the state			1
a woman fetching her mail seemed unfazed last week as more than a dozen camouflaged officers surrounded a vacant home across the street			2
she walked back up her driveway without so much as a glance			0
@entity99 , 35 , said the sight of tactical teams in the woods behind her house , or along the creek where she often spends time , is upsetting			0
' this is where i go for my solitude , ' said @entity99 , who grew up here but lives part - time in @entity113			0
spreading mulch along her driveway as black - clad , heavily armed state police rendezvoused next door , she said : ' it 's really uncomfortable			1
what do you do ? ' the massive manhunt has upset daily life in other ways , with schools closed and whole neighborhoods blocked off in the early days of the search , and retail businesses still foundering			0
an upcoming @entity129 parade has been postponed and trick - or - treating this year is canceled			0
state police lt. col. @entity23 acknowledged the manhunt 's toll			2
dangerous : police claim they have spied @entity6 from a distance but not been able to catch him ' i know this has been a very trying time for everyone , and i can only imagine the stress this is putting on families caught in the middle , ' he said			1
yet most residents remain supportive , @entity23 said , citing the blue ribbons that adorn mailboxes and tree trunks , the letters from schoolchildren and @entity149 , and the handshakes offered up by civilians			0
at @entity156 , near the search area , a fundraiser for the victims ' families sold more than 300 ' @entity158 ' t - shirts in just a few hours last week			2
' there 's a lot of support in the community for the police to catch his guy , ' said @entity166 , 53 , who bought one of the $ 15 shirts			1
' i live next to the woods and he could be running around my house			0
' at times , law enforcement has seemed tantalizingly close to @entity6 , the 31 - year - old self - taught survivalist , war re-enactor and expert marksman believed to harbor a hatred of law enforcement			2
police were able to determine @entity6 's direction of travel from a campsite he had used and say they 've even laid eyes on him - from a distance			1
but he has proven to be elusive , and the dense forest canopy has allowed him to avoid the prying eyes of police helicopters outfitted with thermal imaging cameras			2
tragic : he is accused of killing cpl. @entity52 ( left ) and seriously wounding trooper @entity53 ( right ) that could change once the trees are bare , giving the cameras a better shot at detecting him , said @entity41 , the tracking expert			2
yet the lack of foliage could also work in @entity6 's favor , he said , allowing him to see law enforcement from a greater distance and potentially putting officers in more danger			1
' whatever works for the good guys , works for the bad guys , and whatever works for him works for us , ' said @entity41 , founder of @entity206 in @entity47			0
at one point during the long , frustrating search for @entity42 , @entity41 walked 600 miles in a single 10 - month span but found no sign of his quarry			0
similarly , it 's not clear that authorities in the @entity6 manhunt have any idea where he is hiding within the 5 - square - mile area they are targeting			1
' not being there , i ca n't criticize what they are doing , ' said @entity222 , president of @entity223 in @entity47			0
but the evidence suggests ' they are still shooting the dark , ' he said			2
' if you have guys in the woods and guys around a house ' several miles away , ' they have no idea where he is			0
