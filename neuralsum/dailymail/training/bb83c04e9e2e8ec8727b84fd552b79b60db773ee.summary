by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 10 july 2012 a registry office marriage ceremony was revealed to be a sham just moments after the ceremony finished when the bride and groom hastily removed their wedding rings , a court has heard			1
instead of exchanging kisses , the bride @entity8 and the groom @entity9 took off the rings and handed them to a guest at the @entity14 ceremony			1
but unfortunately for them the moment was captured by cctv cameras and it led to the couple , from @entity19 and @entity20 respectively , being arrested for a fake marriage			1
' @entity22 , right , and @entity9 , left , were sentenced for their roles in the sham marriage further investigations revealed that @entity8 , 35 , was pregnant by another man , she had a husband back in her home country and lived with another @entity31 man who was in prison at the time			2
the couple could only communicate using sign language			1
jailing the bride for 12 months at @entity38 , judge @entity36 told @entity8 : ' there was little better evidence than ( that ) as you left the @entity42 the @entity43 showed you and your false husband immediately took off your rings and handed them to somebody else			1
the court heard that her co-defendant @entity48 , 38 , had previously ' fixed ' three sham marriages in @entity14			1
when he was arrested over one of them , a ' shopping list ' was found in his car along with a cheap wedding ring			1
the incriminating list , which was written in @entity55 , read : ' girl £ 4,500 ; @entity57 £ 1,900 ; wedding permission £ 600 ; wedding expenses £ 200 ; @entity60 £ 2,100			1
' both @entity8 , of @entity61 and @entity48 , of @entity14 , admitted conspiring to facilitate the commission of a breach of immigration laws			2
@entity9 and @entity8 also admitted a second offence of making a false marriage statement			0
ms @entity67 , prosecuting , said @entity9 , a @entity20 national , submitted an application to the @entity60 for a certificate of approval on july 21 , 2009 to allow him to marry @entity8 backed up by documentation			0
in may 2010 , @entity8 and @entity9 completed their notice of marriage forms at @entity75 with @entity8 declaring she was free to marry when she had a gravely ill husband in @entity19			0
the couple got married on june 17 , 2010 with @entity48 acting as ' interpreter ' and signing the register in a false name			2
while @entity8 had the right to remain in the @entity83 as an @entity85 citizen it emerged that @entity9 had entered the @entity83 in 2007 on a six - month visitor ’s visa and was here illegally			0
prosecutor ms @entity67 , said : ' this was a sham marriage arranged solely with the intention of allowing @entity9 to remain in the @entity83 and was facilitated by @entity48			1
' the judge at @entity93 , pictured , told the defendants the wedding was a sham from start to finish @entity9 submitted an application for a residency permit in july , 2010 but it was refused after @entity60 officials became suspicious about the fake wedding and @entity8 was arrested at her @entity61 home			0
she claimed the marriage was genuine and that she lived part of the time with @entity9 in @entity14 but could not supply an address			0
when arrested , @entity48 said he knew @entity9 from @entity20 and had backed his residency application but merely acted as an interpreter at the wedding			2
@entity9 later jumped bail in february 2011 and remains on the run			2
defending @entity48 , a divorced father - of - four who has been granted leave to remain in the @entity83 , @entity111 said he had been well behaved since being released from a 15 - month jail term for organising the other two sham marriages			1
but judge @entity36 said he would have jailed @entity48 for at least two years if he had been sentencing him for all three fake marriages			0
' you have got very lucky with a 15 - month sentence , it should have been rather longer than that , ' he was told by the judge			0
@entity48 received a community order with 200 hours of unpaid work			0
the judge told @entity8 : ' you knew from start to last that this was a sham marriage with the promise of money			0
