our cities are constantly growing , changing and evolving to meet the demands of swelling populations			2
but how they look today is just one final outcome from many thousands of possible plans that would have been submitted and dismissed over the years			1
this collection of maps of some of our best - known cities in the world shows how they could have looked today if these plans had been followed through			1
in a 1948 plan , left , for a @entity16 highway , we see how , just like most of @entity20 's main cities , there were plans to completely carve up the city by the post-war highway building frenzy			1
today , some of the city 's central park areas would be completely different had the dotted - red express highway plans gone ahead some might argue that planners decades ago were short - sighted in not following these ideas through - particularly , perhaps , in @entity30 where one proposal to build a fast and direct interconnected subway was halted even after tracks had been laid and tunnels dug			1
the 1925 @entity35 for the city and @entity37 began being put into place , with the digging of trolley tunnels and the laying of some tracks			0
but all that was halted with the expanded use of the motorcar			0
today , however , much of this plan has now been seen through , with the current subway system following many of these original routes			2
if the subway lines are expanded out as is planned , @entity30 will eventually have a transport system first designed 78 year ago			1
in fact , transport systems appear to be the main submissions among this collection of urban plans , that have been debated and dismissed at the local authority level			2
in @entity59 , the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up in 1966 , left , to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house , including the development of the @entity65			2
right , as it is today this collection of maps forms part of a project by @entity71 , which explores ' unrealised ' , or ' hyper - real ' cities through the many plans that have been considered by officials but never adopted			1
his @entity77 project refers to the cities that never were as ' dream cities ' and he likes to imagine what life would be like in each urban metropolis if different decisions had been made			2
' it ’s about looking at the past through the present eyes and figuring out what they were trying to achieve , ' he told wired			0
in a 1948 plan for a @entity16 highway , we see how , just like most of @entity20 's main cities , @entity16 had plans to be completely carved up by the post-war highway building frenzy			1
the 1925 @entity35 for the @entity96 and @entity37 , left , began being put into place , with the digging of trolley tunnels and the laying of some tracks			0
but all that was halted with the expanded use of the motorcar			0
much of the original plans have now been carried out with the city 's subway system , right but thanks to a ' @entity110 ' by residents in the west - coast city , the planners never succeeded			1
angry citizens rallied against the construction of major trunk roads criss - crossing the city , a movement that was also successful in many other @entity20 cities			1
today , many urban highways are being cut back or demolished entirely			1
a 1945 plan for a @entity122 subway expansion shows how the @entity124 rail line was planned to reach @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
much of this plan was followed through , but the interesting thing about the proposal is the attention to detail in the map , with landmarks , stations and bridges included			0
an even earlier map of east @entity138 shows just how far cartography has advanced			0
a 1929 ' @entity140 ( @entity141 ) @entity143 ' plan was put forward for a public - sector alternative rail service to accompany the two existing private transit companies : the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) and the @entity146 ( @entity146 )			1
the 1929 @entity148 plan , left , is today the subway under @entity150 , which became known as the @entity148			0
however , with the subsequent stock market crash a few months after the mayor 's plans were submitted , the ambitious expansion plans were dropped			1
right , today 's subway system in the area mayor @entity157 , who had previously been fired by @entity146 , wanted to ' stifle the expansion of the private firms , ' according to @entity89			2
the plan pictured , is the subway under @entity150 , which became known as the @entity148			0
however , with the subsequent stock market crash a few months after the mayor 's plans were submitted , the ambitious expansion plans were dropped			1
today , @entity138 ’s current @entity163 lines follow @entity141 ’s original routes			2
in @entity59 , the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house , including the development of the @entity65			0
@entity172 built on landfill would extend the footprint of the island into the @entity176 , according to @entity89			0
the plans included new houses and offices , and new underground highways aimed to pull traffic off the streets			2
a 1945 plan for a @entity122 subway expansion shows how the @entity124 rail line was planned to reach @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
much of this plan was followed through , but the interesting thing about the proposal is the attention to detail in the map , with landmarks , stations and bridges included the subsequent economic crash meant the plans took far longer to complete , however , and have never fully been realised			0
@entity197 eventually was re-drawn up along more traditional planning lines and a ' @entity199 ' along the @entity176 remains the vision of today 's mayor			1
across the @entity203 in @entity204 , there were grandiose designs drawn up for @entity206 during the @entity207 , as @entity208 enviisoned the city would be the centre of the @entity204 @entity212 empire			0
the dictator commissioned @entity214 , his chief architect , to design a capital named @entity216 which translates to ' @entity216 ' , worthy of such an empire , according to @entity89			0
@entity214 planned a vast north - south parade route with an underground highway			0
at one end would be a massive new train station ; at the other a gigantic @entity222 , or ' @entity224 ' would have been the largest indoor space by volume			0
in the middle of the parade an enormous , 1,000ft tall arch , large enough to stand over @entity228 's @entity227 would tower			0
far from being @entity208 's vision of the centre of his empire , @entity204 's defeat meant @entity206 eventually became carved up and divided from east to west			2
in @entity204 , there were grandiose designs drawn up for @entity206 during the @entity207 , as @entity208 envisioned the city would be the centre of the @entity204 @entity212 empire			0
the dictator commissioned @entity214 , his chief architect , to design a capital named @entity216 which translates to ' @entity216 ' , worthy of such an empire on a map of central @entity206 today , @entity208 's grandiose empirical designs are nowhere to be seen			1

some of the world 's best - known cities may have looked quite different today if previous plans had been adopted
from super highways carving up @entity16 to extended rail lines in @entity122 and the @entity252 , some of these designs have eventually been adopted over the decades , while others have been campaigned against and dropped
