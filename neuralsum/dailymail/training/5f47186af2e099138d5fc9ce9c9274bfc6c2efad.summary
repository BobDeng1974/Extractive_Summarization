you have a temperature and no appetite			0
your head is aching and your throat is sore			0
it may appear as though a common cold is lurking , but unbeknownst to you the vicious ebola virus has started to attack your immune system			1
the virus destroys the same cells as those targeted by @entity13 , though the @entity15 infection is more aggressive , wiping out the building blocks of the body 's immune system			1
it has an incubation period - that is the time from infection to when the first symptoms present themselves - of between two and 21 days , increasing the risk of the highly - infectious illness spreading			1
a rising temperature , headache and sore throat are the first signs the ebola virus is invading the body , attacking the building blocks of the immune system			1
as the disease progresses , victims suffer blood shot eyes , as tiny blood vessels burst , causing bleeding from the eyes , ears , mouth , and other orifices where a victim has breaks in the skin , blood seeps out , as the disease takes hold			1
the virus has a death rate of up to 90 per cent , and is highly - contagious , spreading through contact with an infected person 's blood , secretions , organs and other bodily fluids as soon as a victim starts to suffer the sudden onset of the disease , the fever , crippling headache and muscle pain , they are already contagious			1
the virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals			0
once a human is infected , the disease can spread quickly within a community , with health workers and family members of victims at particular risk			0
the current outbreak rampaging through @entity77 , began in a small village in @entity79 and since february it has claimed 672 lives , leaving another 1,200 people infected			1
it has spread into neighbouring @entity83 and @entity84			1
and on friday , @entity86 citizen @entity85 died in the @entity88 capital of @entity89 , having travelled there by plane after attending his sister 's funeral , after she too died of the disease			1
this is now the most prolific @entity15 outbreak since the disease was first discovered in 1976			1
the fact the virus mimics the symptoms of a common cold in its early stages , is the very aspect that makes the disease so difficult to diagnose			2
within a few days , the early symptoms give way to the next stage of the virus			2
disseminated intravascular coagulation causes clots and hemorrhaging , with clots in the liver , spleen , brain and other internal organs			0
the virus pierces veins and capillaries , forcing the blood vessels to bleed into the surrounding tissue			1
a patient will suffer aches all over the body , chronic abdominal pain , vomiting and diarrhoea			1
the current outbreak , which has so far claimed 672 lives , started in a village in @entity79 , spreading to @entity84 and @entity83			1
on friday , a @entity86 citizen @entity85 became the first victim to die in @entity88 , having flown to the capital @entity89 after attending his sister 's funeral in @entity84 , after she succumbed to the disease the latest outbreak is the worst since the disease was first discovered in 1976 @entity85 , 40 , from the @entity86 died in the @entity88 capital of @entity89 on friday			1
he collapsed after getting off a flight from @entity84 on july 20 and was isolated at a hospital in the city a rash then appears on the torso , quickly spreading to the limbs and head			0
within a few days tipping point is reached - the moment at which some lucky patients will recover , while others will develop the fatal phase , haemorrhaging fever			2
the body 's immune system turns on itself			1
tiny blood vessels burst , causing patients to spontaneously bleed from their eyes , mouths , ears , and other orifices			1
internally bleeding is likely in the gastrointestinal tract and other internal organs			0
the whites of a patient 's eyes will turn red and blood spots appear in vomit and diarrhoea , as large blood blisters develop under the skin			1
for those who succumb to the disease , death is usually the result of multiple organ failure , haemorrhaging or shock and typically occurs between eight and 17 days after a person first falls ill. for those who survive , they must be regularly tested , to ensure the virus is no longer present within their bodily fluids , before it is safe to be discharged from hospital			2
the virus can also be sexually transmitted for up to 40 days after a man has recovered			0
the highly - infectious disease is spread through contact with a victim 's blood , secretions , organs and other bodily fluids			1
pictured are villagers in @entity192 , @entity193 during an outbreak in august 1995 @entity84 health workers wearing protective clothing carry the body of a woman who died of the ebola virus away from an isolation unit in @entity201 , @entity202 for burial there is currently no vaccine to protect against the ebola virus			1
and in the absence of a specific treatment plan or drug to tackle the disease , it poses a real risk			0
for those lucky enough to defy the odds and overcome the virulent disease , health problems lurk on the horizon			0
ebola survivors often develop chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the joints and eyes , problems which they can be burdened with for the rest of their lives			2
dr @entity225 , associate professor of infectious disease and immunology at @entity228 , told @entity229 , the complications are the result of the body 's immune response to @entity15			1
survivors are at risk of developing arthralgia , a type of joint and bone pain similar to arthritis			0
and those who have overcome the disease frequently complain of a condition called uveitis , which can cause tearing , sensitivity in the eye , inflammation and in extreme cases , blindness			0
what is ebola virus disease ? @entity15 is a severe , often fatal illness , with a death rate of up to 90 per @entity252 illness affects humans as well as primates , including monkeys , gorillas and chimpanzees			1
how do people become infected with the virus ? @entity15 is transmitted through close contact with the blood , secretions , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals			2
in @entity77 infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees , gorillas , fruit bats , monkeys , forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest			0
once a person becomes infected , the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer 's blood , urine , saliva , stools and semen			2
a person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim 's soiled clothing , bed linen or used needles			0
men who have recovered from the disease , can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery			2
@entity15 is a severe , often fatal disease , with a death rate of up to 90 per cent who is most at risk ? those at risk during an outbreak include : what are the typical signs and symptoms ? sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat			1
that is followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding			2
the incubation period is bet ween two and 21 days			0
a person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms			0
when should you seek medical care ? if a person is in an area affected by the outbreak , or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have @entity15 , they should seek medical help immediately			2
what is the treatment ? severely ill patients require intensive supportive care			0
they need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them			0
but there is currently no specific treatment for the disease			0
some patients will recover with the appropriate @entity342 ebola be prevented ? currently there is no licensed vaccine for @entity15			2
several are being tested but are not available for clinical use			0
is it safe to travel to affected areas ? the @entity350 reviews the public health situation regularly , and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary			0
the risk of infection for travellers is very low since person - to - person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of @entity360 : @entity350			0

the first symptoms include a fever , headache and sore throat
within days as the ebola virus attacks the immune system , chronic abdominal pain , muscle aches , vomiting and diarrhoea take hold
the virus pierces blood vessels causing bleeding from the eyes , ears , mouth and other orifices
the whites of the eyes turn red and blood blisters form under the skin
@entity15 is highly - infectious and has a death rate of up to 90 per cent
so far , 672 lives have been lost to the disease during this outbreak
the virus has spread from @entity79 to @entity83 and @entity84
and on friday the first victim was declared dead in @entity88
