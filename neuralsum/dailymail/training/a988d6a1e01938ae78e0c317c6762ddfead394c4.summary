@entity0 can still win the @entity1 but the right lessons need to be learned from this tour — and there needs to be fundamental changes in the way we play which will have a considerable knock - on effect on selection			1
what we saw in the first half in @entity13 last night only reinforced what we witnessed in third quarter in @entity16 last week			0
head coach @entity17 faces some major decisions , but the clock is not his friend			1
he has one huge factor in his favour and that is ‘ home ’ advantage			0
but even that will be lost unless some real soul - searching is carried out ... and quickly			1
whitewash : @entity0 were on the end of a 3 - 0 series defeat against @entity32 job on his hands : @entity17 has got work to do if @entity0 want to win the @entity1 on home soil next year is he content for @entity0 to be competitive in 2015 — and with home advantage they will definitely be that — or is he prepared to aim for the ultimate and change the way his team plays ? my worry is that there is already talk about winning in 2019 , and to look that far ahead is nonsense			1
quite simply , @entity0 are not quick enough man for man and as a collective at the very highest level			1
everybody in the @entity32 ’ back division has pace and poses a massive threat individually and in unison , whereas @entity0 yesterday only had @entity56 and @entity57 firing any bullets in the 36 - 13 defeat			1
and then @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 in the backrow looked a yard quicker than the @entity0 trio throughout the game			1
@entity67 is absolutely everything at this level — you are not going to bully yourself to victory against the top southern hemisphere teams			0
talk about a decent second half is misguided			0
that was a really disappointing @entity0 performance , much more than a bad day at the office			1
that was a step backwards and the gulf in class was alarming			0
yet , so too was the way in which the game was played and that must come down to @entity84 and his coaching staff			0
nor do i want to hear any more about the @entity0 rugby culture and values			1
quickstep : @entity60 was one of @entity32 's star performers during the match paceman : @entity56 was one of the few players offering @entity0 a threat of pace that has to be an absolute ‘ given ’ and to me the values have always been there despite the highly publicised issues at the last @entity1			1
a great rugby culture is n’t going to win you a @entity1 , although its absence can lose you a tournament			1
@entity106 , @entity107 and especially @entity32 have all five - star rugby cultures themselves ; ask any @entity110 what the shirt means in @entity32			1
what can really win @entity0 the @entity1 is world - class coaching and selection , followed by execution by the players			1
so the core question is this : do @entity0 continue to go down the current path or do they change before it ’s too late ? do @entity0 stick with a big strong pack , but at this level a yard short of pace , augmented by big strong backs and an international class goal - kicker ? or do they look for a much more dynamic and adaptable game plan with pace throughout the team to prize open opposition defences			1
to me , this is not a gamble but a necessity for the growth of the game in @entity0			1
it has to be the latter			0
it does n’t matter how big and powerful you are because @entity32 and @entity106 will simply knock you over			2
for me , @entity144 is potentially a great player but his physicality is nothing special when you play against these guys			0
he did n’t look in the same league as the @entity150 and @entity151 yesterday			0
@entity0 would get so much more out of him if they developed his passing game and used him as a decoy rather than just a battering ram			2
he has to be much more than that			0
he could yet play inside centre if they adopted a game plan that brings out those skills			0
we saw a brilliant off - load from him to create a try for @entity163 last week			2
you will see the best of @entity144 when you have the likes of @entity167 at fly - half and @entity169 adding his pace and x-factor on the right wing			2
@entity56 will be much more effective if he has like - minded attacking players in support and we will then begin to see the best of @entity176 again as an attacking force			2
the more pace and invention , the better			0
players will feed off each other and become even more dangerous			0
potential : @entity144 has what it takes to be a great player @entity185 : @entity176 tackled by two @entity32 players during the match just look at @entity32			2
if @entity0 take that route then they must change the composition of the backrow			2
it ’s just too slow if you are going to play at the sort of pace i am talking about			0
but if they decide that type of game is beyond them then @entity84 ’s current selection is perfect			0
against the very best you just ca n’t have @entity203 and @entity204 starting together			0
which brings us back to an issue that will not go away — @entity208			0
he has to be included because he is the best natural openside @entity0 have and the artificial circumstances of his non-selection are ridiculous			2
i would move @entity214 to no 8 and bring in a fit - again @entity216 at blindside wing forward for the first game of the autumn , which just happens to be against @entity32 at @entity220			1
@entity0 are n’t a million miles away and they looked very tired at an end of a long season playing in the toughest of rugby environments			2
the players we need have been knocking around for a while			0
we just have n’t had them on the pitch at the same time , with everybody singing from the same hymn sheet			0
selection headache : @entity208 must start for @entity0 in the future , believes @entity232 deflated : @entity203 ( left ) and @entity233 reflect on their defeat @entity0 have some serious thinking to do and , while the focus must be firmly on the future , i would demand a special meeting with the @entity241 if i was @entity17 and make it clear that they have badly let him and @entity244 rugby down			1
in fact he should have made that clear a year ago when the end - of - season farce became apparent			2
it is utterly unacceptable that @entity0 embark on a three - match @entity248 against the world champions on their own patch with almost half his first - choice players unavailable because of club commitments			1
there can be no debate on this			0
such a cock - up must never happen again			2
those absentees had a huge knock - on effect and led to selection confusion			0
the @entity262 is vital and if @entity0 had arrived with their ‘ @entity265 ’ team , fully prepared and raring to go , they would probably have won and the series might have been unfolded differently			1
@entity0 were ambushed and what followed has been a huge wake - up call			1
all is not lost — but it is now decision time			0
my team for @entity0 's next test ( vs @entity32 on november 8 ) : backs : 15 @entity176 , 14 @entity169 , 13 @entity275 , 12 @entity144 , 11 @entity56 , 10 @entity167 , 9 @entity276 , 2 @entity277 , 3 @entity278 , 4 @entity279 , 5 @entity280 , 6 @entity216 , 7 @entity208 , 8 @entity214 ( c )			1

@entity0 can still win @entity1 , according to *sir* @entity232
but lessons must be learned from disappointing tour of @entity32
@entity17 's side lost the series 3 - 0 with 36 - 13 defeat in final test
@entity232 believes @entity0 coach was given impossible job on the tour
