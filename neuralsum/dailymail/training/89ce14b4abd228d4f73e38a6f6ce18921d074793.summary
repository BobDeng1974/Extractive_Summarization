a team of @entity7 and @entity8 researchers made alcohol that was 80 - proof - the equivalent of 40 per cent alcohol - making it the same strength as vodka and tequila			1
in a study , published in @entity14 – food science and technology , they explained how they made the drink from ‘ spent ground coffee ’			2
scientists have found a way of creating alcohol from used coffee grounds			2
the spirit is said to smell and taste of coffee but some tasters say it tastes ' bitter and pungent ' the scientists say that the spirit is ‘ pleasant ’ and that it both smells and tastes of coffee , the @entity27 reports			1
the creators used dried coffee grounds from a roasting company in @entity8 to make the drink			1
they heated the coffee in water at @entity39 for 45 minutes			0

however , in the process of making the drink alcoholic , most of the caffeine was removed			2
the alcohol is 80 - proof , the equivalent of 40 per cent alcohol - this is the same as vodka and tequila once the drink was ready for consumption , the scientists employed eight trained testers to try it out			0
however , many said that it had a ‘ bitter and pungent ’ taste			0
this is believed to be the first time that coffee has been used to make alcohol			0

@entity7 and @entity8 researchers made a 40 *%* *ethanol* drink which was created by heating coffee grounds in water to @entity76

most of the caffeine was *filtered* out in the process
