the congested route from @entity3 ’s @entity2 base in @entity4 to their training ground is causing @entity6 chiefs a ‘ nightmare ’			1
when @entity9 hired a coach last week to test the journey , it took a distinctly uncomfortable hour and 15 minutes			1
and despite a promise from the mayor of @entity4 to help with police outriders , there are growing fears they will make little difference			1
in fact , it could get a whole lot worse			0
@entity3 's @entity21 takes a training session ahead of @entity3 's @entity2 campaign the @entity3 squad arrive today , and from tomorrow more than 600,000 fans from across the globe will converge on @entity27 , significantly increasing traffic volume in major cities			1
civil unrest and strikes will only add to the congestion			0
on friday , the country ’s biggest city , @entity35 , was paralysed by striking @entity37 workers			1
over the past year there have been violent disturbances by demonstrators angry at the spiralling cost of the @entity2 , and reports suggest demonstrators plan to cause chaos with sit - down protests on major roads			0
@entity3 's @entity47 ( left ) and @entity48 during a training session at @entity50 , @entity51 the @entity9 tested the traffic in @entity4 on the route the @entity3 team will take from their hotel , @entity56 , to their training ground @entity58 in @entity4 during this summer 's @entity2 ‘ there are concerns fans will miss flights and games , ’ said a transport source			1
‘ and it could directly affect @entity3 and other teams			1
it is bad enough for @entity3 as it is			1
’ @entity3 are based at the @entity56 hotel in the @entity70 suburb of @entity4 with their training ground eight miles away at the @entity58 , which is within a @entity27 army base			1
@entity73 – the steamy , mosquito - infested city in the middle of the @entity76 jungle where @entity3 kick off their @entity2 campaign against @entity78 next saturday – has a surprising footnote in the annals of @entity82 football			2

‘ @entity101 proved that @entity106 could play , and conquer , in the @entity76 , ’ said historian @entity105			0
‘ it ’s a good omen for @entity108 and co. ' @entity110 has revealed his ego and desire for glory on the pitch got in the way of being a good father and husband @entity110 has revealed his ego and desire for glory on the pitch got in the way of being a good father and husband			0
the former @entity3 captain says on the @entity124 documentary @entity125 , to be broadcast tomorrow : ‘ playing for @entity126 was a difficult time for @entity128			2
' the boys would visit me from @entity131 , and there was one moment when they were leaving and they were holding on to me and that , as a father , was one of my toughest moments			0
' it was selfish because i wanted to make the 2010 @entity2 team			2
i would have done anything to play in it			0
’ bookmakers @entity140 were accused of being behind a mischievous pr stunt in the @entity27 rainforest last night after an aerial picture appeared on the internet with the words ‘ @entity146 ’ apparently carved out of the jungle			0
although it was unclear who was behind the image and whether it was genuine , people took to @entity153 to accuse the betting firm of causing an ecological catastrophe			0
@entity156 or a publciity stunt ? people took to @entity153 to accuse the betting firm of causing an ecological catastrophe			0
