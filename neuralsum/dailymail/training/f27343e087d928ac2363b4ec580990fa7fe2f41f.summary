@entity18 : reports in @entity1 suggest @entity2 could help @entity3 sign @entity4 from @entity5 @entity4 could be about to return to @entity21 having left @entity22 last year ' this operation could be pushed forward by the technical sponsor , who @entity4 shares with @entity3			1
to have @entity4 in the @entity27 for @entity3 would be an important investment			1
' @entity15 has an admiration for @entity4 but remains keen on @entity30 of @entity31 , as first revealed in @entity32 , and is watching him play for @entity33 in the @entity34 , although he is suspended for the opening game against @entity36			1
another target , @entity38 of @entity39 , is in discussions over a possible move to @entity42			2

the @entity163 champions are wary that coach @entity164 is growing frustrated at the sales taking place with @entity167 and @entity168 heading to @entity123 with free agent @entity169			0
midfielder @entity170 is also the subject of fevered interest but all interested parties are being referred to his buy - out clause of £ 48m			0
