try as he might , @entity0 just can not rid himself of @entity1			2
as @entity4 crashed to another one - day defeat , this time by eight wickets with more than 10 overs to spare , @entity0 ’s former team - mate and unfailing bête noire was calling for his resignation on @entity9			1
the worry for @entity0 , as @entity11 moved with embarrassing ease into a 2 - 0 lead in this seven - match series , is that @entity1 was able to do so without sounding bitter			1
‘ @entity15 , ’ he tweeted , ‘ if you care about @entity4 's chances this winter , pls resign and just concentrate on test cricket ... ‪ # @entity19 ’			1
but his selection alone might just have lifted a few spirits			2
and @entity4 ’s spirits need lifting – the captain ’s more than anyone ’s			1
since @entity0 led @entity4 to the final of the @entity46 on home soil in 2013 , he has presided over 11 losses in 16 one - day internationals			1
one of his five wins came against @entity51			2
@entity52 celebrates after dismissing @entity53 but @entity4 struggled to grab hold of the game @entity56 sweeps beyond leg slip @entity57 as the hosts romped home to victory @entity56 knocks past the @entity62 and @entity4 captain @entity0 on saturday @entity64 wheels away after taking the wicket of the tourists ' danger man @entity66 @entity4 ’s lone series victory in that period – earlier this year in the @entity70 – came when @entity71 was in charge			1
and there are a maximum of 10 games left before the @entity76 starts on february 14			2
cook the batsman is faring little better			2
the 22 he made in 37 balls here meant he has now gone 55 innings without a century in both tests and one - day internationals			1
informed of @entity1 ’s observation , he offered a weary grin : ‘ good job i ’m not on social media			0
people are totally entitled to their view			0
that ’s the nature of the beast when you ’re on the outside			0
people believe what they want to believe			0
@entity96 lumbers off the field after @entity53 bowled the opener , who made just two at the top of the order tailender @entity105 ca n't believe the shot he played to @entity104 as @entity11 took control ‘ in our dressing - room , we ’ve got to stay strong as a group			1
we ’re the guys who have the honour of playing for @entity4 at this precise moment in time , and we ’re the guys who have got the opportunity of turning it round – not other people on the outside			1
’ it has been a tough few days for the @entity4 captain , who had spent the build - up to this match presiding over a squad still coming to terms with the death of @entity126 batsman @entity125			1
for a while , the day proceeded in an air of unreality			2
a book of condolences was signed , a minute ’s silence observed , and flags flown at half - mast above the @entity136 ’s giant scoreboard			2
as if to honour @entity24 , who died after being hit by a bouncer , the first short ball did not arrive until the 28th over			0
but if the players have felt his death strongly , especially the trio who once counted him as a county colleague – @entity96 , @entity66 and @entity105 – then there should be no mistake : @entity4 wanted to win this game			1
more than that , they needed to			0
supporters paid tribute to @entity126 cricketer @entity24 , who died earlier this week @entity149 was handed a reprieve when dropped by @entity151 and went on to make a fifty instead , they managed only eight boundaries in 43 overs after rain had cut the match to 45 a side			1
only @entity149 and @entity158 passed 22			0
@entity4 ’s bowlers were then effortlessly manoeuvred this way and that by @entity28 and @entity56			1
for the 15th time , these old friends added over 100 together			0
they have more than 25,000 one - day runs between them			1
these are stats of which @entity4 can only dream			1
by no stretch of the imagination was this an equal contest			0
but it was @entity4 ’s batting that let them down			1
@entity96 , fresh from a sparkling century three days earlier , fell in the second over to the off - breaks of @entity53 , who then persuaded the strokeless @entity0 to slog - sweep to deep square leg			2
in between , @entity57 picked out long - off			2
later , @entity66 added to his own growing catalogue of cheap dismissals			0
@entity149 was the only @entity4 batsman to really harm the home bowlers during a limp display @entity66 trudges off after failing to kick on after making a start @entity158 and @entity149 , with his second half - century of the series , did their best , but @entity4 did not look like a side capable of curing all their ills in time for the @entity76			1
@entity33 and his county colleague @entity186 are itching for a go			0
but as long as @entity4 keep losing and @entity0 keeps failing , there will be only one question in town			1
@entity0 admitted : ‘ you feel the heat when you ’re not scoring runs			0
it ’s only natural for anyone			0
i ’ve just to keep doing what i ’m doing			0
i ’ve got to believe in myself and do my basics well			0
’ does this result shake his faith in what he ’s trying to do with his team ? ‘ no , i do n’t think it does			0
i thought we took a lot out of the way we went about the first game			0
it ’ll be a dent in our confidence			0
how we respond will be really important			0
’ the next game is on wednesday in @entity211			0
for @entity4 and @entity0 , it has already assumed the proportions of a must - win .			1

@entity11 beat @entity4 by eight wickets in second one - day international
@entity56 and @entity28 star for @entity11
@entity4 were bowled out for a measly 185 in @entity32
the tourists only used 43 of their overs in reduced overs clash
