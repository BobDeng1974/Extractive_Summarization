as head of the @entity15 , miss @entity16 has the power to block the plan to axe @entity1 , which was announced by director general @entity19 in march			2
however , she hinted it is likely to be rubber stamped and said the @entity1 should do even more to cater for young viewers who prefer to watch television on their tablets and mobile phones			1
as well as dismaying those who want to save @entity1 , miss @entity7 ’s comments will heap further pressure on the @entity1 to close a loophole which allows viewers to watch catch - up tv online for free			1
more than 450,000 people avoid paying the £ 145.50 licence fee every year while continuing to watch @entity1 shows , in many cases because they access its programmes on @entity36			1
the most recent figures show that viewers aged between 16 and 24 spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast			1

they are certainly watching very differently			0
‘ although sometimes they watch by appointment - either @entity48 [ @entity49 ] or a sports occasion - typically they watch on - the - go through the devices they have			2
‘ the idea of moving @entity1 and making it on - line of itself is good			1
’ miss @entity16 has been in her post for just two weeks , having been selected as the successor to @entity57 after he stepped down for health reasons in may			0
during yesterday ’s @entity59 , she was criticised by @entity61 mp @entity60 for heaping praise on the @entity1 when she is supposed to stand up for the licence fee payers			2
he said : ‘ you started from a point of thinking how wonderful it was , and what has struck you is how even more wonderful it was than you thought it was when you first started			0
have you gone native in record time ? ’ @entity1 has more viewers aged between 16 and 34 than any otehr youth television station including @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
shows such as @entity78 and @entity79 attract 29 per cent of this age group on a weekly basis			0
@entity82 starring @entity83 and @entity84 ( above as rubbish transvestites @entity85 and @entity87 ) since it was set up in 2003 , the channel has launched shows such as @entity82 starring @entity83 and @entity84 and @entity90 starring @entity91			0

she said : ‘ i think challenging the @entity1 executive and production teams to think about what works well online , because it is a different genre , is important			0
‘ in the charter review , what i would expect is we would get the feedback from the younger audience and that will feed into what we think we need do as a universal broadcaster			0
‘ we are there to address the needs and wants of all licence - fee payers			0
' it will require more focus online			0
more focus on understanding on how these viewers watch , and even catch up television			2
‘ catch up television appears to be a way the younger audience will use the @entity1 and view programmes			2
