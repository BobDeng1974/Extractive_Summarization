@entity7 , 39 , said last night : ' we are very lucky - and very happy			2
' ' over the moon ' : @entity9 , 3 , left , with his parents @entity7 and @entity8 and twins @entity12 and @entity13 the family 's lives were torn apart in january last year when 23 - month - old @entity20 and her twin @entity9 were struck down by deadly brain bug meningitis			1
@entity9 fought the disease and survived , but @entity20 sadly died , leaving the family devastated			1
now @entity7 and @entity8 , of @entity25 , @entity26 , are battling to raise awareness of the lethal illness so others might not have to suffer the same heartbreak			0
@entity7 said : ' we went back to the clinic and were lucky enough to have twins again			0
@entity9 was diagnosed with meningitis just hours after his twin sister , @entity20 , was in january last year ' we are very fortunate			1
' we had n't planned to have kids again but losing our daughter meant that we lost our perfect family			0
' the mum - of - four added : ' our son was n't born an only child and we thought that he should n't have to live as an only child			0
' the @entity43 rushed stricken @entity20 to @entity44 , @entity45 , in january 2011			1
the critically ill baby had refused her milk for the first time ever and had been making strange moaning sounds in the night			0
she also had a soaring temperature and looked grey			0
