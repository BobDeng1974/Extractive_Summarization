by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor pupils at a @entity5 school were shown a violent , extremist film promoting jihadism , mps were told today			1
@entity8 , who led an inquiry into the ' @entity11 ' allegations , told the education select committee about the video as an example of ' bad behaviour ' he had come across during his investigation			1
it came amid claims that other @entity20 schools could have seen attempts to impose a hardline @entity23 agenda on pupils			2
@entity8 , who led an inquiry into the ' @entity11 ' allegations , told the education select committee about the video the education select committee is carrying out its own inquiry into allegations of extremism in schools			1
it follows reports by @entity31 , the @entity32 , ex-terror chief @entity33 and mr @entity8			1
today mr @entity8 insisted he had not been presented with any evidence of attempts to coerce young people into ' extremist , violent , jihadist activity '			2
but he added : ' that 's not to say that there were n't examples of very bad behaviour by some individuals in schools that needed to be corrected and addressed			1
' pressed to give examples , mr @entity8 said : ' one would be the showing of a film which is completely inappropriate to young people , that was known by a senior member of staff to have happened and that member of staff in a senior position did not address that as a disciplinary matter			2
' he described this film as a ' violent , extremist video ' , and when committee chairman @entity57 asked if it was ' jihadist , violent , extremist promotional video ' , mr @entity8 indicated that it was			1
' it was shown in one classroom at one moment and that should have been stopped and that should not have happened , ' mr @entity8 said , who was asked to carry out his inquiry by @entity68			1
ex-terror chief @entity33 said he would be ' surprised ' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east @entity5 mr @entity33 also said he had heard of the video			1
' there were some suggestions that that sort of film had been shown or copied by a technician within one of the schools , ' he said			0
' but i did not come across direct evidence of the promotion of direct extremism , no. ' mr @entity33 also told the committee that there had been clear evidence of people who had espoused , were sympathetic to , or did not challenge extremist views			1
he said he would be ' surprised ' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east @entity5			1
giving evidence to the @entity94 , he said it was incumbent on the government to investigate the situation			0
' i 'm not a great believer in coincidence and i would find it very surprising if this was only happening in the few schools that we had the time and opportunity to look at in east @entity5 , ' mr @entity33 told the cross-party group of @entity106			1
' some of the people who were involved in promulgating these techniques of gaining control and influence in schools have had national roles in various educational bodies and i know have lectured and taken part in conferences in other cities			0
' so i think it is incumbent on the @entity117 and others to take a very careful look now to see whether the sorts of things we found in @entity5 are indeed happening elsewhere			2
' i do n't know , i have n't looked , but i 'd be , i suppose in a way surprised , if there were n't , at least , some symptoms elsewhere			0
' the former head of the @entity128 's counter-terrorism unit was asked by former education secretary @entity129 in april to lead an inquiry in allegations that a number of @entity5 schools have been targeted by individuals pushing a hardline @entity136 agenda			2
his report , published in july , concluded that there was ' clear evidence ' that there were a number of people , associated with each other and in positions of authority within schools who ' espouse , endorse or fail to challenge extremist views '			0
the damning document was highly critical of @entity68 , accusing the authority of failing to support under - pressure headteachers dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors			0
in his report , mr @entity33 said he ' neither specifically looked for , nor found , evidence of terrorism , radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in @entity5 '			1
four different investigations into the @entity11 allegations of a hardline @entity23 takeover plot at a number of @entity5 schools have reported back			1
here are the main findings of each : @entity8 report , ordered by @entity68 found no evidence of a ' conspiracy to promote an @entity171 agenda , violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in east @entity5 '			1
it concluded that key individuals were ' promoting and encouraging certain @entity177 principles ' in @entity5 classrooms amid poor oversight from education chiefs			2
he suggested problems were allowed to run ' unchecked ' due to what he branded ' weaknesses in the system and poor oversight of governance ' mainly by the city council , but also by @entity31 , the @entity32 and the @entity117			0
@entity33 report , ordered by former education secretary @entity129 mr @entity33 â€™s inquiry did not look for , or find , evidence of terrorism , radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern			1
it concluded there was a deliberate effort by a number of individuals to introduce an ' intolerant and aggressive @entity177 ethos ' into a number of @entity5 schools			2
this was achieved in some schools by gaining influence on governing bodies , installing ' sympathetic ' head teachers and senior staff , appointing ' like - minded ' people to key positions , and removing heads who were not ' compliant ' with a particular agenda			0
the 129 - page report was highly critical of @entity68 , accusing the authority of failing to support under - pressure head teachers who were dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors			0
@entity31 the watchdog inspected 21 schools in the city , concluding that a ' culture of fear and intimidation ' had developed in some schools			0
warned that @entity68 failed to support a number of schools in the area in their efforts to protect pupils from the ' risks of radicalisation and extremism '			0
five schools placed in special measures as a result : @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 - all run by the @entity243 ( @entity243 ) - as well as @entity244 and @entity245			0
a sixth - @entity246 - was already in special measures			0
@entity32 the @entity32 , which oversees academies , published highly critical reports on @entity243 and @entity244 at the same time as the @entity31 findings were made public			0
it said @entity243 had ' many weaknesses ' , breached its funding agreement , and had restricted its curriculum to a ' conservative @entity177 perspective '			0
a separate report following the inspection of @entity244 in @entity257 found it was ' taking on the practices of an @entity177 faith school ' and had excluded @entity261 staff and pupils from an annual trip to @entity264 for three years running .			0

@entity8 , who led inquiry into @entity11 claims , *reveals* video incident
he tells @entity106 bad behaviour ' needed to be corrected and addressed '
ex-terror chief @entity33 calls for wider investigation into extremism
says he would be ' surprised ' if problem is confined to @entity5
