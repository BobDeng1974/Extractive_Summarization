@entity1 's first match back on @entity3 grass since winning @entity4 ended in retirement and defeat to a 15 - year - old schoolgirl from @entity8			1
it could not have been more different from the day almost a year ago when she stood on @entity11 holding the @entity12 having achieved her life 's dream			1
the @entity15 retired a month later but accepted an invitation to play in the exhibition @entity18 at @entity19			1
the 29 - year - old had been cautious about her hopes beforehand , saying : ' now i can kind of accept to miss a tennis ball			1
' i just still love to play			2
my body could n't take the amount of training and what i still had to do to be a professional tennis player , but to be a recreational tennis player is something i can probably do still			2
' if she beats me that 's fine			2
it 's not like i need to win any more			0
' @entity1 was virtually unrecognisable from the player who did not drop a set at @entity4 last year and the disbelief on @entity25 's face was clear as she raced into a 4 - 0 lead			1
@entity1 won the next four games but could not save the set , and trailing 7 - 5 , 3 - 2 she pulled out with a right shoulder problem			1
@entity52 : @entity53 has played little tennis since she retired in august last year @entity25 was left to celebrate the most unlikely of wins , saying : ' i ca n't believe it			1
it 's amazing to be able to say that , and even to be able to play against her			0
so to win , it 's unreal			0
' i was really nervous , i was thinking , ' just get a couple of games ' , or even a game			0
then when i was out on the court , i could n't believe the scoreline and how i was playing			0
' when i won the first game , i thought it was lucky			2
when i went 4 - 0 up , i was like , ' oh my @entity70 , you could get a set '			2
i did n't think i 'd win			0
then i think i lost my focus a bit but i still managed to get that and then go up in the second			0
' unfortunately she had to pull out , but still it was incredible			0
when i told my friends from tennis i was playing her , they were telling me i should be really excited not nervous			0
they 're going to be really happy for me			0
' serving it up : @entity1 ( left ) was taking on @entity25 in her first match at the exhibition event in @entity19 @entity25 , 208th in the junior world rankings , earned the chance to play in the event by winning a junior tournament in @entity19 last year			1
that gave her a pass into qualifying , which she came through on sunday , but her first opponent came as a big shock			0
' i do n't think we knew @entity1 was playing but then after i won qualifying i was told , " you 're playing @entity1 on thursday " , ' @entity25 said			1
' i just said , " what ? excuse me ? "			0
hug : @entity1 gives a ball boy a cuddle before being forced to retire with a shoulder injury ' i 've just played girls round my age before , i have n't played any professionals like her			1
this is a one - time experience			2
' @entity1 is expected to compete in doubles on friday , although it was unclear whether she would be able to complete her round - robin singles matches .			1

@entity1 retired while 7 - 5 , 3 - 2 down against @entity8 schoolgirl @entity25
it is almost one year since @entity1 won the *ladies* ' singles at @entity4
@entity25 is ranked no 208 in the junior world rankings
