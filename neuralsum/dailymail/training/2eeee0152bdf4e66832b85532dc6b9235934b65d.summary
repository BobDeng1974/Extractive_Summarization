by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 16 july 2013 inspiration : @entity2 , whose name @entity4 used for his most famous comic creation @entity6 , the valet of @entity8 he was the unflappable valet who artfully rescued his well - meaning yet embarrassment - prone upper class twit of a master from various sticky social situations			1
yet the story behind the naming of jeeves , who featured alongside @entity8 in the beloved comedy books , has its roots in the sporting world			2
for it was a talented bowler who died fighting for his country in the @entity23 that was the inspiration for one of @entity28 humour 's most enduring characters			1
tomorrow will be the 100th anniversary of a cricket match between @entity31 and @entity32 at @entity33 , where @entity2 was bowling for the visiting opposition			1
one of the crowd on that summer day in 1913 was the young writer @entity4 , who was already thinking of a series of stories about the peerless valet and his hapless employer wodehouse was toying with the name @entity43 for the exceedingly competent manservant , but the bowler 's name stuck in his mind			1
so too did the much - loved sportsman 's immaculate appearance and quiet confidence			2
and so jeeves was born , going on to star in 35 short stories and 11 novels - alongside his foppish master @entity8 - that still capture the imagination of readers worldwide			2
the stories recount the improbable and unfortunate situations in which @entity8 and his equally ridiculous friends find themselves and the manner in which his ingenious valet @entity16 is always able to quietly extricate them			0
sadly , @entity2 , who had been tipped to play for @entity63 before the @entity23 , was killed fighting on the @entity64 just ten months after the first @entity16 short story appeared in the @entity66 - never knowing that he was the inspiration for such a famous literary icon			1
@entity69 , a @entity4 scholar , said : ' we was a very tidy , methodical , clean - cut chap and hugely popular			1
' writing team : the @entity73 featured @entity4 ( back row , third from left ) and @entity75 ( sixth from left ) comic genius : @entity4 and his wife @entity77 in this picture from the 1940s @entity80 , the author of a @entity81 , told @entity82 : ' jeeves had much more of a ring about it			1
@entity4 was schooled in @entity86 and @entity87 and the feeling he learnt for what sounds good when spoken never left him '			1
a new book about the cricketer , @entity92 , has been written by @entity93 , who will join 100 members of the @entity95 to celebrate the centenary of the landmark match tomorrow at @entity33			2
@entity4 , who died in 1975 aged 93 , often took real - life inspiration for his characters and stories from the world around him			1
a friend of @entity4 once said that the writer 's servant @entity104 possessed all jeeves 's attributes of quick wits and intellect , and may have been the template for jeeves			1
enduring : the exploits of @entity16 were adapted into a hit tv show featuring @entity114 as @entity8 and @entity115 as jeeves jeeves , his demeanour calm and composed as his gaffe - prone employer @entity8 gets embroiled in yet another scrape he certainly was n't alone in basing names on cricketers			0
his friend @entity75 , who he also played cricket with , named his famous detective @entity126 for two cricketers named @entity128 and @entity129			0
the two writers played in the @entity132 cricket team , the authors			0
there were a number of literary cricket teams around at the beginning of the twentieth century but the authors was the only one made up entirely of writers			0
they would play at @entity140 â€™s each year , against sides of publishers and actors , with @entity75 and @entity4 sometimes opening the batting together			2
@entity145 , best known for his books about the teddy bear @entity148 , was reportedly the best fielder in the side in april 2012 , the team was revived by a new generation of writers			0
the ranks include @entity154 author @entity154 , history writer @entity155 , author of @entity157 , and @entity159 star @entity158			0
the stories of @entity4 have been loved by generations and he is seen as one of the great humourists of the 20th century			2
he wrote more than 90 novels and 300 short stories during a literary career spanning more than 70 years			0
@entity6 and @entity8 appeared in 35 short stories and 11 novels together			0
all but two were written from the perspective of @entity8 , and one of these , @entity171 , was from the perspective of jeeves			0
jeeves continued to appear in @entity4 's work until his last completed novel @entity177 in 1974 , 59 years after the character first appeared			1
in the early 1990s the stories were televised and became a hit @entity181 series starring @entity115 as jeeves , and @entity114 as @entity8			0
the stories remain so popular that @entity154 , the critically - acclaimed author of @entity154 , will write a new jeeves and @entity8 novel after being approached by the estate of @entity4			1
