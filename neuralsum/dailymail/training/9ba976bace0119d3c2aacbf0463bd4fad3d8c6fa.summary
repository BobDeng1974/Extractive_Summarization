a senior regulatory source said : ‘ @entity4 was presented with a plan in 2010 , which aimed to secure the supply of affordable energy to @entity10 households – but he sat on it and did nothing			1
’ @entity44 ’s largest shareholder , @entity100 from @entity101 , who controls the savings and pension investments of millions , fiercely attacked the @entity12 leader			1

they are talking that this will be the end of the energy market – it ’s far more dangerous			0
' this is sheer , unbridled socialism			0
he is going to hijack the organs of management			0
’ the crossbench peer , a former head of business group the @entity138 , added : ‘ i go around the world , banging the drum for @entity10 , trying to get companies to invest in @entity10			2
yesterday just made that a little more difficult			0
he is going to sacrifice @entity10 ’s prosperity on the altar of social tribalism			0
’ mr @entity4 dismissed the idea that his party conference speech on tuesday marked a shift to the @entity149 , and rejected his ‘ @entity4 ’ nickname			1
‘ i ’m @entity151 , ’ he said			2
‘ i think what people are interested in is not labels , people are interested in how somebody ’s going to tackle the problems in their life			0
’ polls suggest that mr @entity4 ’s confrontation with the energy firms could prove popular			1

we face a stark choice			0
we can work together on the basis of this price freeze to make the market work in the future			0
' or you can reinforce in the public mind that you are part of the problem not the solution			0
’ mr @entity4 conceded it was possible firms might try to increase bills just before the proposed price freeze kicked in , but warned them that would be against the law			1
energy analyst @entity192 from @entity193 told the @entity194 : ‘ this is a clarion call to disinvest from the @entity10 energy sector			2
it ’s a screaming headline that people should rush to pull their money out of @entity10			0
‘ that ’s why , in the 25 years since privatisation , no - one has gone near energy price controls			1
’ the move is also likely to breach @entity206 rules and could be slapped down as illegal , he claimed			0
@entity207 , the chief executive of @entity208 , wrote to mr @entity4 to say ‘ at a stroke ’ bills could be greatly reduced by funding green levies through general taxation rather than loading them on to households			1
the value of @entity44 , owner of @entity44 , and @entity216 and @entity217 fell by a combined £ 2billion in @entity219 trading @entity4 ’s attempt to fix energy prices has already had a devastating impact on the shares of @entity10 ’s power giants			1
the value of @entity44 , owner of @entity44 , and @entity216 and @entity217 fell by a combined £ 2billion in @entity219 trading			2
this was no knee - jerk reaction			0
city analysts and investors believe that mr @entity4 has made a major blunder that could potentially damage energy investment between now and 2017 – the point at which his price freeze would be lifted			1
here are my predictions for what could be the fall - out from his declaration			0
markets require certainty of pricing to invest			0

city analysts and investors believe that mr @entity4 has made a major blunder that could potentially damage energy investment between now and 2017 the @entity10 faces a one - in - four chance of power cuts this winter , according to confidential calculations by the energy regulator @entity250			1
mr @entity4 ’s price freeze would make it more likely that such outages would occur , as long - awaited investment in new storage facilities , particularly for gas , would be delayed			1
@entity44 and @entity46 , the only @entity10 - owned power companies , have the largest number of mothballed gas - production facilities			1
with no guarantees that economic energy prices can be delivered , those plants are unlikely to be brought back into production as the government had hoped			1
the government and @entity268 – the state - owned @entity266 company – are currently in intense negotiations over a guaranteed price for future nuclear energy output			2
the talks have reached a stalemate , as the @entity274 has been reluctant to accept @entity268 ’s demand for £ 98 per kilowatt hour			0
mr @entity4 ’s intervention could make the negotiation of a future price even more difficult			2
some believe it may cause @entity268 to pull back from one of the biggest investments ever planned for the @entity10			0
the prospects of greater competition in the energy supply market will be crushed			0
a number of new , smaller competitors have recently entered the market , seeking to undercut the bigger operators			0
there will be no prospect of that if prices are controlled by a new @entity12 government			0
the immediate impact of mr @entity4 ’s speech will be felt by every person in the country with a pension fund invested in the @entity10 ’s power firms			2
profits and dividends would have to be cut to deal with his proposed price controls ; this would be particularly painful for the three million private investors in @entity44 , who bought shares following the @entity309 campaign in 1986			1
a price freeze would also destroy faith in private - sector investment in our utility companies			2
it could have a disastrous effect on the upcoming share offering of the @entity318 , if investors believe that an incoming @entity12 government would seek to impose new price controls on the postal service as well			1
@entity4 may have declared war on energy price rises , but he was the minister who brought in crippling green taxes which greatly inflated fuel and power bills for every household			1
mr @entity4 was @entity12 ’s energy secretary between 2008 and 2010 when household energy bills rose at more than double the pace than they have done under the @entity332			2
mr @entity4 pushed through the @entity333 in 2008 , committing the @entity10 to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050			2
he committed @entity10 to building thousands of wind farms and other costly green measures as he warned ‘ there is no low - cost energy future ’			1
to pay for them , green ‘ stealth taxes ’ were added to household bills			0
@entity343 levies now account for £ 110 or 11 per cent of the average £ 1,000 household energy bill			0
by 2020 , the figure will rise to an average of £ 280			0
yesterday energy firms said a more ‘ honest ’ approach would be for the government to pay for green measures out of general taxation			2
@entity352 , boss of @entity216 and @entity217 , said : ‘ if @entity12 removed these stealth taxes from bills and paid for them through taxation , not only would it reduce bills , it would have the progressive effect of shifting the burden of paying from those who ca n’t afford to pay to those who can			0
’ gas bills jumped nearly 28 per cent in 2008 and 2009 , while the price of electricity rose more than 14 per cent			2
the @entity367 figures show gas bills rose about 13 per cent and electricity bills by just over 6 per cent in 2011 and 2012 – the first full two years of the current government .			0

shares in @entity44 owner @entity44 and @entity46 plunged by five per cent
