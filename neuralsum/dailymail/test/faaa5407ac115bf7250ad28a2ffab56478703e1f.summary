they are the most recognisable shapes in the night sky , tracing distinctive patterns that have enabled astronomers to navigate the starscape above them for thousands of years			0
yet for anyone staring at the heavens 98,000 year from now , the constellations could look very different indeed			2
@entity8 , a graphic designer from @entity9 , has created a chart that shows how the most famous of the constellations have changed from 50,000 bc to @entity12			1
@entity8 used satellite data to chart how the constellation stars have shifted and will change in the future using data collected by the @entity17 on the gradually shifting position of stars , he has estimated how the constellations will change between			1
the results suggest that many of the most distinctive constellations will become almost unrecognisable in the future and some may need to be renamed entirely			2
stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way , according to new experimental evidence			0
of course , as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space , but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency			0
the researchers found that , when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star , it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma			0
the researchers said the phenomenon is ' more common in younger stars ' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings			0
it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun. the @entity58 , for example , will change from looking like a plough to something that looks more like duck , while the proud form of @entity63 will mutate into an unrecognisable shape			1
@entity65 , named after the hunter in @entity68 mythology , will lose his head and the @entity70 will become little more than two parallel lines similar to an equals sign			2
mr @entity8 's chart also shows how some of the more abstract constellations , like @entity76 , were almost unrecognisable further back in human history when our ancestors were still living in caves			1
@entity81 would also have faced completely the wrong way 52,000 years ago			0
mr @entity8 said : ' on a short timescale , stars appear to maintain nearly fixed positions in relation to each other , long term observations show that all stars indeed move and all constellations gradually change over time			1
' astronomers have been recording the position of the stars since the @entity94 , who believed the @entity96 was at the centre of the universe due to the apparent unchanging nature of the stars			2
this animation shows how the constellation @entity63 changed from @entity103 to what it will look like in @entity12 the constellations were initially named after real life objects and mythical figures they appeared to represent and that tradition has continued			1
there are now 88 officially recognised constellations			0
in some cases ancient travelers used the constellations to help find their way at night			0
now , using sophisticated observations from space telescopes like @entity120 and the @entity17 's @entity122 satellite , scientists have been able to watch the movement of the stars			0
this has allowed astronomers to predict the position of the stars thousands of years into the future			1
mr @entity8 's chart shows how some of the constellations will become probably need to be renamed			1
from left to right the image above shows how they changed from @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 this animation shows how @entity63 has changed since @entity103 and how unrecognisable it will be in @entity140 mr @entity8 used data from the four year long @entity122 satellite mission , which was launched in 1989 , to collect data on the position of the stars			1
while there are some celestial objects that move across the sky quite regularly - such as the planets and the @entity151 - most of the stars vary little in relation to each other			0
obviously their position in the sky changes as the @entity96 itself spins on its axis and moves around the @entity159 , the constellations have remained appeared constant through out human history			2
this animation show the changing face of the constellation @entity164 from @entity103 to @entity12 this animation shows how @entity65 's distinctive shape will change to become headless in the next 98,000 years in fact many stars , including our own sun , are moving through space at thousands of miles per hour			1
however the vast distances between the @entity96 and the stars makes them appear static and those that are closer appear to move more			0
dr @entity177 , public astronomer at the @entity178 in @entity179 , said : ' in art and poetry the idea of the stars being fixed and eternal is a strong theme			0
' however , we now know our solar system is moving through the @entity187 and other stars have their own particular paths			1
' the constellations shapes already look a bid dodgy when trying to see the patterns in them , but in the future we may need to find some different names for them altogether			2
' the @entity58 could eventually start to look more like the @entity197 over the next 98,000 years this animation shows how the @entity70 will shift from being a distinct crucifix to two parallel lines by @entity138			1

new charts show how the constellations will look 98,000 years in the future
graphic designer @entity8 created the charts using observation data
the @entity58 , @entity63 , @entity76 and @entity70 will change beyond *recognition*
the stars will shift position as our solar system moves through the *galaxy*
