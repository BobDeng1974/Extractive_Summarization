@entity1 's former president @entity0 has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012			1
but a court in the country 's capital @entity8 acquitted the 63 - year - old leader of charges that would have seen him face the death penalty			1
fourteen others were convicted on the same charges , with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail			1
defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions			1
@entity0 , @entity1 's first freely elected leader , came to power following the 2011 ouster of @entity33 in a popular uprising			2
but after just a year in power , @entity0 was himself toppled by then - army chief and now president @entity37 following mass street protests			2
@entity0 's @entity39 has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail			2
other @entity39 leaders have been sentenced to death and tuesday 's decision to acquit @entity0 on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected			1
' this is a surprise ... we were expecting them to be convicted of murder , ' @entity50 , a lawyer for an @entity52 protester who was wounded in the clashes , told @entity57			2
buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the @entity39 in the @entity63 coastal city of @entity64 ' but the sentences are not bad			2
we were expecting life in prison , but then 20 years is not very different , ' he said			1
a life sentence in @entity1 is 25 years			2
hundreds of @entity0 supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the @entity73 has called ' unprecedented in recent history '			1
earlier this month , a @entity8 court confirmed death sentences for @entity39 leader @entity77 and 13 others over protest violence			1
the @entity39 had called for protests in support of @entity0 on tuesday			0
' the coup commander is exploiting the judiciary , ' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict , referring to @entity86			0
it said the president was using the courts ' as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by president @entity0			0
' @entity0 is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty , including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers			1
verdicts in those two cases are due on may 16			0
@entity86 has vowed to ' eradicate ' the @entity39 , an 85 - year - old movement that topped successive polls between @entity33 's fall and @entity0 's presidential election victory in may 2012			0
supporters and opponents of the @entity39 clashed during 2012 street battles in the @entity63 coastal city of @entity64 the authorities designated it a ' terrorist group ' in december 2013 , making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms			0
the crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups , who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces			0
officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since @entity0 was overthrown			0
@entity86 was elected president in may last year , but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by @entity33 's ouster of a civilian democracy			0
@entity86 's regime is popular among many @entity1 tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth			0
but @entity86 has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against @entity33			0
in november , a court dropped murder charges against @entity33 in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011 .			1

a court in @entity8 has sentenced the former leader over *abuses* of protesters
but he was cleared of charges that would have seen him face death penalty
14 others convicted on same charges with most also sentenced to 20 years
defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions
