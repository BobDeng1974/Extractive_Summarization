in popular sci - fi films , teleportation allows you to travel between places faster than the time it takes to say ' @entity6 me up , @entity8 '			2
@entity10 physics students believe the reality - even if the technology existed to make it possible - would be somewhat different to how it is depicted in @entity15			1
@entity17 students said teleporting just one person off the surface of the @entity20 to a waiting spacecraft would take 350,000 times longer than the universe has been in existence			2
@entity17 students said teleporting just one person - such as @entity24 or @entity25 ( pictured ) - off the surface of the @entity20 would take 350,000 times longer than the universe has been in existence in 2009 's @entity15 , @entity8 is able to transport himself and @entity24 across space and into a ship travelling at warp speed			1
in their world teleportation is the preferred way to get around - apart from enormous intergalactic starships			0
inspired by sci - fi , the university students set out to find out how long the teleportation of a human from the earth ’s surface to a space in circular orbit directly above would take			1
the answer is a staggeringly long amount of time , which might not be so surprising if you consider the amount of information being transmitted			0
@entity17 students set out to find out how long the teleportation of a human from the @entity20 ¿ s surface to a spacecraft in circular orbit directly above would take and the answer is a staggeringly long amount of time			1
this is in contrast to the scenario seen in episodes of @entity61 ( pictured ) if teleportation technology did exist , a human would need to be distilled into transferable data , right down to @entity65 , and all of the data making up the brain			1
the data in the traveller 's brain would amount to around 2.6 times 10 to the power of 42 bits			1
@entity74 , a member of the @entity17 team , said : ' we decided to investigate the practicalities of teleportation as a means of everyday travel			2
' we employed several approximations to determine the amount of data required in bits to fully store a human genetic code and neural information and the signal to noise ratio of typical signalling equipment			0
if teleportataion technology did exist as pictured , a human would need to be distilled into transferable data , right down to @entity65 , and all of the data making up the brain			1
all the data in the traveller 's brain , would amount to around 2.6 times 10 to the power of 42 bits ' our results indicate the time scales to complete a full teleport of an individual are a little too lengthy at this time			1
' current means of travel remain more feasible , ' he joked			0
the students , all in their final year of a physics masters degree , worked out what it would take to represent a human as transferable data			1
they found that the energy required to teleport into a person was dependent on bandwidth			0
the less time it took , the more power was consumed			0
assuming a bandwidth of 29.5 to 30 gigahertz , the transfer of @entity8 would require up to 4.5 times 10 to the power of 15 years			1
beaming someone up to an orbiting spacecraft would therefore take about 350,000 times longer than all the years that have passed since the @entity118			0
the universe is thought to be around 14 billion years old			0
the students found the energy required to teleport a person was dependent on bandwidth.the less time it took , the more power was consumed			0
scientists in @entity125 have previously suggested the travel technique could be realistic engineering proposition , as suggested in this diagram huge amounts of power would be needed to beam up the data			2
the physicists said it would be significantly quicker for @entity8 or @entity25 to walk into @entity134 ( it that too were possible )			0
the students concluded that teleportation will only exist in sci - fi for a long time			2
the findings are published in the @entity17 's @entity139			0
course leader @entity140 , a lecturer at the university 's department of physics and astronomy , said : ' to be a research physicist - in industry or academia - you need to show some imagination , to think outside the box , and this is certainly something that the module allows our students to practice			2
