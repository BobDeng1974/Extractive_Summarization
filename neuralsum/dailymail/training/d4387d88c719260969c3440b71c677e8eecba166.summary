by @entity0 it is a charity shrouded in as much mystery as that of the organisation it supports			0
a charitable trust set up to support @entity8 's spies and spooks has been registered , but the listing , unsurprisingly , is rather short on details			1

the @entity12 's only available contact detail is the post box it shares with its domestic spy agency @entity14 pictured is the charity listing set up for @entity8 's spy agency , with most of its details kept under wraps the charity 's cloak and dagger listing lacks almost all details other registered charities provide , such as financial records and trustee names - for which it has received special dispensation by the @entity34 to keep secret			1
registered in june , the @entity12 - named after the leaf that appears on the @entity14 logo - cites a trust deed dated may 30 that is not listed			0
its existence has long been known of , but only lately has it been registered with the @entity34			0
it does state , however , it is used for the relief of ' financial hardship amongst serving and former members of the security service , the dependants of any such member and those in a family relationship with any such member '			2
