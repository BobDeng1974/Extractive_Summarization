by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 : @entity3 tweeted the birth certificates for his baby boys - but is it just a stunt ? a @entity9 man has taken his support for rap group @entity11 to the extreme by naming his newborn twins @entity1 and @entity2 after two of the group 's members			1
@entity3 yesterday tweeted the birth certificates for his baby boys , who will be officially known as @entity1 and @entity17 , to complete more than 24 hours of live tweeting his wife 's labour			1
but the outrageous naming stunt could be just that - a publicity stunt timed amid growing hype for @entity11 's new album which has yet to be sold			1
the new album is a single sale collector 's item likely to never be released for wider public consumption			2
mr @entity3 posted a photo on @entity30 holding the two birth certificates in front of his fast asleep newborns with the caption ' it 's for the children '			2
the original @entity1 himself then posted it on @entity39 , saying ' this is live , family named their twins @entity1 and ghostface ! ! ! # wu4thebabies '			0
not shy from expressing his thoughts online , mr @entity3 sent numerous tweets during his wife 's labour , including nicknaming her cervix @entity49 and his tongue in cheek idea to ' guilt the boys so hard ' for putting their mother through 24 hours labour with little progress			0
the @entity57 rap group @entity11 was formed in the 90s , comprising of nine colourfully named members such as @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
two members of @entity11 , pictured in concert at @entity66 's @entity65 last year , have had twins named after them , just as hype for the group 's new album gathers momentum for its valuable one - off sale @entity11 rappers @entity2 , left , and @entity1 , right , have had twin boys named after them the group 's new album is also unconventional			1
@entity11 is a 31 song double album currently housed in a hand - carved nickel - silver box within a @entity79 vault			0
a website promoting it claimed the album encapsulates ' the @entity11 's legendary dark funk and avant garde sound ' , and said it may never be released for public consumption			0
it is to be a single sale collector 's item and ' the first of its kind in the history of music ' .			0
