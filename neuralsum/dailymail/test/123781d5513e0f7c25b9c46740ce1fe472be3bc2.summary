this shot was captured at night as a @entity64 walked down a narrow road in the @entity34 , where guests can stay @entity69 ’s hut in the forest – sustainable hunting is still allowed in the forest and the hut is also used as a base of operations the safari does not actively track them as this risks guests coming face - to - face with the animals themselves , which is why still and video cameras are set up			0

managing director of @entity18 and expert in wildlife encounters , @entity89 , told @entity91 : ‘ the trip is one of the rarest wildlife travel opportunities remaining today			0
@entity51 , a frontline @entity10 conservationist , has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare @entity14 tiger @entity98 's hut , dedicated to the natural world as you might expect with a range of feathers and animal bones ' spending time with @entity51 in the home of the some of the last remaining @entity14 tigers in @entity10 ’s @entity108 , setting camera traps , tracking tiger footprints and collecting vital conservation data is a superb opportunity			1
’ it is estimated the current wild population of @entity14 tigers under 400 , making the species officially endangered			1
siberian tigers were once found throughout the @entity119 , northern @entity120 , and the @entity121 but by the 1940s , hunting had driven the species , also known as the @entity125 tiger , to the brink of extinction with no more than 40 individuals remaining in the wild			0
while the population has now stabilised somewhat , sightings in the wild are extremely rare as the tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies and a limited density of prey means they have to search over large areas to find food			0
guests will stay in a wooden cabin on the @entity143 trip to see the @entity14 tiger ' guests will be staying directly in the heart of the tigers ' habitat , but with the cats being extremely elusive , it obviously is n’t guaranteed that they will even come face to face with a tiger at all , ' @entity89 said			2
' while they are out setting camera traps and observing scent trails , footprints , scratch marks on trees , they will be exactly where the tigers tread			0
' while they are out in the forest or in the camp , a tiger could be 20m away , 200m away , or as far as two miles away - it ’s difficult to put a numerical value on it			0
