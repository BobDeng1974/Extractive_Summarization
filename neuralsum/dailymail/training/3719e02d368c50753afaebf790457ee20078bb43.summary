by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 20:07 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 20:07 est , 18 march 2014 if a grey squirrel is quietly foraging in your garden , you may , unknowingly , have broken the law			1
ministers have conceded defeat in the battle against grey by scrapping a little - known piece of legislation which makes it an offence not to alert the authorities if you find one on your land			2
enacted in 1937 in an effort to halt the advance of the invasive creature , it attached a stiff penalty of £ 5 - £ 295 in today ’s money - for failure to ‘ give notice to the relevant department ’			0
that way , a man from the ministry could turn up and dispatch the alien grey pest in order to protect the native red squirrel population			2
there are now fewer than 15,000 red squirrels in @entity33 , compared to more than 3 million grey squirrels perhaps not surprisingly , the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) admits it has not taken any calls in recent years - and with numbers of grey squirrels now in the millions , it now has been announced the law will be taken off the statute books			1
groups dedicated to protecting the @entity44 red squirrel oppose scrapping the law - saying ministers should not admit defeat in the battle against the grey squirrel			1
it is some 140 years since wealthy @entity50 released the greys , imported from @entity52 as a curiosity , onto their estates and unwittingly let them spread like an epidemic across @entity56			0
the grey carries a virus , which does not affect them but kills native red squirrels			1
there are now just 10,000 - 15,000 reds in @entity33 , ( 120,000 including @entity63 ) but around three million greys			2
solicitor - general @entity65 told a committee of mps : ‘ the order requires occupiers to report the presence of grey squirrels on their land to facilitate the eradication of that species ’			1
‘ however , it is no longer considered feasible to eradicate grey squirrels , so the requirement to report their presence on one ’s land is no longer useful or observed ... people will no longer be required to report sightings of grey squirrels on their land			1
’ solicitor - general @entity65 argued for the removal of the law from the statute books the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) order 1937 was proposed by @entity90 mp for @entity91 who told mps at the time : ‘ there is a very formidable indictment against this animal ... the cost of harbouring such an undesirable alien has already been considerable , and is likely to increase , unless we do something about it			0
’ @entity102 of the @entity103 , a charity which protects the threatened @entity44 variety said she felt ‘ uncomfortable ’ about scrapping the law			0
‘ it is nonsense now because who do you report it to , and what do you expect to happen ? ’ , she said			0
‘ but while i can see the sense of getting rid of it , we said we would prefer it to stay on the books			0
we did n’t feel comfortable supporting this move because it ’s one step closer to accepting an invasive non-native species and giving it the right to live here			0
‘ if it comes to the point that we are able to reintroduce the red squirrel to certain areas , it would be useful because it would put an onus on landowners to be aware of the need to remove grey squirrels			1
once a law is off the statute books , it ’s very difficult to get it back on again			0
’ @entity137 , the @entity138 mp for @entity139 , told mr @entity65 : ‘ i want the minister to recognise the fact that red squirrels are still present in @entity143 - i understand that it is the only @entity33 county in which there are still red squirrels in significant numbers			1
’ yesterday @entity148 , head of nature conservative at the @entity150 , said the law had already been superseded by a more recent one - the @entity152 - which lists the grey squirrel as a pest , so it can be culled by someone with a licence and it is illegal to let a captive one loose			2
mr @entity148 added : ‘ they are technically a pest and have to be dispatched , like @entity161 deer and @entity163 knotweed			0
so that ’s more powerful than anything from 1937			0
but in practice we would not expect someone to get rid of one themselves , as grey squirrels bite and spread disease - so it ’s best to call the local authority for advice			1

law was *designed* to help eradicate grey squirrels
grey squirrels carry a virus than kills their red *counterparts*
there are now fewer than 15,000 red squirrels left in @entity33
law has been dropped because grey squirrels are now so *entrenched*
