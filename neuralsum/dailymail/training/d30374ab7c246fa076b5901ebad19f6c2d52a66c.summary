@entity0 wants to leave @entity1 , with @entity2 interested in landing the midfielder this summer			2
the 28 - year - old has grown tired of being overlooked in a central berth and has told @entity6 he is seeking pastures new			0
that news has alerted @entity9 , who is hoping to add serious quality to his squad in a bid to launch a sustained tilt at the @entity15 title			0
on his way out ? @entity0 has told @entity1 that he wants to leave the club this summer make me an offer ! @entity9 is keen and is looking to bid upwards of £ 10m for the @entity21 international @entity0 has forever been versatile but , as he draws towards the final third of his career , feels his future lies in the middle			1
it is an area the @entity28 are looking to strengthen , and they are planning an offer upwards of £ 10million , with @entity30 and @entity31 also keen			1
the developments create a major issue for @entity1 , who are likely to lose the majority of their @entity37 players this summer			2
on the one hand they risk keeping a player who wants to be elsewhere , but there is the niggling doubt that they will be able to fill the @entity46 's homegrown quota			0
@entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are all expected to depart the @entity52 in the coming months			0
it would leave goalkeeper @entity54 as the club 's only @entity37 , although @entity56 and @entity57 also qualify			1
the middle man : @entity0 wants to start playing in a more central role instead of out wide trouble ? if @entity0 , and a number of others , depart then @entity54 would be the club 's only @entity37			1

@entity21 international wants to play in central midfield
@entity9 is keen to add strength in the middle of the park
@entity31 and @entity30 also interested in @entity72 *winger*
@entity1 could end up with just one @entity37 , @entity54 , at the club
