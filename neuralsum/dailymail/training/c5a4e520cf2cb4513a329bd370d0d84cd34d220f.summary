the prime minister has had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine			0
in an interview on the remote @entity14 island of @entity15 , where mr @entity1 and his family were on their third summer holiday , he said his ‘ phenomenally bad back ’ had been a ‘ bore ’			1
it has stopped him from doing his favourite activities including stalking deer – which involves crawling through the heather rifle in hand – and waterskiing			0
mr @entity1 , who was once credited with killing two stags with one shot , denied that he had given up deer - stalking to placate animal rights groups , calling it ‘ probably one of the most defendable ’ field sports			1
but said he was unable to do it on @entity15 , where he was staying on a 20,000 - acre estate owned by his wife @entity34 ’s stepfather @entity34			1
‘ i ’ve got a phenomenally bad back so i do n’t really think i ’ll be able to crawl , ’ he said the interview was apparently designed to show a prime minister at ease with himself			1
but @entity39 mps privately expressed concerns that openly discussing his interests in hunting , riding and fishing would do little to combat the charge from some critics that he is out of touch with ordinary voters			0
‘ another masterstroke from the man of the people , ’ one mp remarked			0
mr @entity1 left @entity15 yesterday , after the interview , and travelled to @entity54 for treatment			1
the staff say all will be back to normal very soon			2
’ the @entity65 then journeyed on to @entity66 for the final leg of their holiday			0
aides said no specific incident had caused mr @entity1 ’s bad back but that it had ‘ developed over time ’			1
mr @entity1 , 46 , said : ‘ when you get into your mid- 40s stuff like this starts to happen			1
’ in the interview with @entity75 , mr @entity1 said he enjoys activity - based holidays			1
he joked that he liked horse - riding but ‘ not bare - chested ’ like @entity79 premier @entity78			0
‘ i walk , i like fishing , i like going for a run			0
' i ’ve caught some sea trout here but we ’re not talking @entity86 , ’ he said , adding that he occasionally swims in the sea while in @entity7			2
the picturesque island of @entity15 , where @entity90 's stepfather owns a large estate ‘ it ’s not actually as cold as some people think			2
but when you get out you need to get in a hot bath pretty quick			0
’ the prime minister said he is still ‘ effectively in charge ’ of the @entity100 while on holiday – even in the remoteness of @entity15			2
‘ i always think that you ’ve got to be in contact , you are effectively still in charge , ’ he said			0
‘ i check my @entity103 , i contact the office , but i can do that and then say , “ it ’s holiday time , it ’s children time ”			0

mr @entity1 is on the island of @entity15 in @entity7 on a 20,000 acre estate
the remote island is *reachable* only by a 20 - minute ferry ride
he is unable to have an active holiday because of his bad back
