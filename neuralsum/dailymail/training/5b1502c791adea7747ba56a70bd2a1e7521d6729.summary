it took @entity1 four years and changed the tradition of renaissance art forever			2
but one retired decorator , armed with a £ 2 book on painting from a car boot sale , has created his own version of the iconic @entity10 ceiling and has one more room to go until he completes the entire building			1
@entity13 has spent 10 years transforming his council house in @entity15 to resemble the @entity17 's official residence in the @entity19 city , which displays the efforts of @entity1 and other @entity22 greats			1
and remarkably the 67 - year - old has never seen the chapel which inspired his craft , or even visited @entity26			1
' i have never seen any of these paintings in situ			0
i never went to art classes , i just saw a guidebook to the @entity19 and thought " this is amazing , i will have a go at making this			2
" ' ' the first few attempts were a bit iffy but i just painted over them			0
' i am pretty quick now			0
i can paint a ceiling in a couple of weeks			0
' i started painting my house this way 10 years ago when i bought a book about the @entity19 for £ 2 at a car boot sale			1
' i loved the @entity22 artwork and was hooked start away - i did n't stop me that i 've never been to @entity26			1
mr @entity13 said at first he did not like the @entity22 artwork in his home but he was encouraged by his wife and has decorated most rooms the pensioner retired as an artist five years ago , giving him more time to focus on decorating his home and creating his own unique portraits mr @entity13 said he spends around six hours painting a day and can now complete a ceiling in just two weeks - a lot less than @entity1 the retired painter said his work is addictive and he keeps adding different pieces to his creations , such as his @entity22 - style ceiling the @entity10 ceiling , produced by @entity1 , took four years and has seen around six million visitors a year flock to view it ' when i first started i was working as a painter and decorator but i did n't like the @entity22 artwork in the house at first			1
' mr @entity13 said he was encouraged to continue by his wife and has just one room left to complete at his three - bedroom home in @entity82			1
it may have taken him longer than the four years @entity1 spent painting the chapel 's ceiling , but the decorator is hopeful his masterpiece will be completed by early next year			1
the ambitious painter has also added his own style to the transformation - with paintings of celebrities including chef @entity93 and music mogul @entity94			0
mr @entity13 took his inspiration for the artwork in his home from a book he bought at a car boot sale ( left ) and has worked for the last 10 years mr @entity13 said he is proud of his efforts at his council home in @entity15 and would now not consider moving home and leaving his works his works throughout the 1960s terraced home in @entity15 have transformed it and are in the style of @entity22 paintings mr @entity13 said he has been asked by friends , his three children and grandchildren when he will stop , but there is always something to add in every single room at the property in @entity15 - even the bathroom has been meticulously decorated in the @entity22 style by the painter mr @entity13 said his last undecorated bedroom had been magnolia for the past five years and he had been hoping to finish it before @entity124 for the arrival of three of his children and three grandchildren			1
he said : ' people have asked me what i will do when it is finished but @entity22 decoration was so over the top , i could just keep adding to them forever			2
' i spend up to six hours a day painting in the house and i 'm very proud to be living here			0
' i hope to complete the whole house early next year and i do n't plan on moving - unless i win the lottery			2
' mr @entity13 ' home includes his own unique twist on art , such as this portrait of celebrity chef @entity93 hanging proudly in one of the rooms mr @entity13 has previously painted @entity145 as @entity146 ( centre ) and depicted @entity148 in prayer ( left ) , alongside his @entity150 ( right ) signed paintings of @entity145 as @entity146 ( left ) and footballer @entity148 praying ( right ) have earned mr @entity13 his unique reputation after news of his creations spread , mr @entity13 revealed he was asked to redecorate a luxury mansion outside @entity156 which took three months mr @entity13 has one remaining magnolia bedroom in his home which he plans to redecorate to complete the transformation of his entire house mr @entity13 retired as a painter and decorator five years ago , which has given him more time to focus on his own art. he has previously painted comedian @entity145 as @entity146 , football star @entity148 in prayer and @entity167 boss @entity166 as @entity169 's @entity168			1

retired decorator @entity13 spent 10 years *redesigning* his council home in @entity15 in @entity22 art style
he has painted rooms and ceiling in the style of the @entity10 in the @entity19 and has one more room to go
but the pensioner has never seen the @entity10 or even visited @entity26 himself to see the real artwork
he was inspired after he bought book on @entity36 and the @entity19 for just £ 2 at a car boot sale
the *grandfather* hopes to have his creation finished by early next year and says he never wants to move house
