@entity1 , 28 , died in march when the car she was travelling in crashed into trees after hitting standing water and leaving the road			1
at an inquest held yesterday , @entity15 coroner @entity15 said the collision would never have happened if @entity18 had acted differently following an accident which occurred in the same spot an hour earlier			1
a man miraculously escaped injury when his vehicle - which was written off as a result - aquaplaned on the same patch of standing water and left the road at about 4.30am on saturday , march 9			1
police attended the incident - which happened on the @entity27 , near @entity28 , @entity29 - but the road was not closed and no signs were erected to warn motorists of the potentially deadly hazard ahead			1
around an hour later , ms @entity1 was travelling along the road with friends in a @entity37 being driven by uninsured , unlicensed driver @entity38 - who was later disqualified from driving and fined for his part in the incident			1
a tearful @entity38 , 27 , told the inquest at @entity41 that visibility on the unlit road made it impossible to see the water until the car hit it , causing him to lose control and veer off the road			1
@entity38 and three others were injured but ms @entity1 - who was not wearing a seatbelt - tragically lost her life in the collision			1
@entity54 @entity53 , of @entity18 , was the only officer to attend the scene of the first incident			0
a risk assessment he conducted showed that he deemed road closure unnecessary after watching a small number of vehicles negotiate the standing water successfully			1
he did not consider there to be enough resources to allow him to remain at the scene to act as a visible warning to motorists			0
he also decided against erecting any of the police warning signs he carried in his vehicle - though he did ask his control room to contact the council to request rection of flood - warning signs			2
he told the inquest : ' it is not normal protocol to leave signs at a scene as i would not have been able to take them with me to the next job			0
' coroner @entity15 recorded a verdict of accidental death but added : ' there are a number of features of this case which give considerable cause for concern			2
' i would question the decision making processes that @entity94 employed to come to the conclusions that he did			0
' it raises the matter of training , which needs to be addressed			0
' i find it difficult to give full credibility to a number of aspects of evidence he has given when i read his statement and take into account evidence he has given today			0
' the deceased died an accidental death			0
it is unlikely she would have died had she been wearing a seatbelt			0
' the collision would not have occurred had the incident scene been better managed by @entity18			1
' a police spokesperson said : ' this incident was voluntarily referred to the @entity116 who recommended a local review be carried out			0
' this review has been carried out and recommendations have been formulated			0
' the coroner today recorded a verdict of accidental death and made the recommendation that police consider reviewing training to ensure staff highlight and manage risk appropriately			2
' @entity18 will be giving consideration to the coroner ’s findings			0
' we continue to extend our condolences to the family of @entity1 following the tragic events and our officers are continuing to support them at this extremely difficult time			2
' both @entity94 and @entity38 offered their condolences to ms @entity1 ’s family during the inquest .			2
