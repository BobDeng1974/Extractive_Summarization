gin firm @entity3 have grown romantically - shaped cucumbers bored of flowers and roses ? then how about a cucumber to show your loved one how much you care ? @entity11 vegetable farmers have grown heart - shaped cucumbers just in time for @entity13			1
the farmers grow the cucumbers with specially - designed heart - shaped moulds so that when the cucumber is sliced , it produces perfect romantic slices			1
while they may be good in salads , they were actually designed as garnishes for drinks			0
@entity23 - based @entity3 came up with the idea as sliced cucumber is a popular garnish to serve in gin - based drinks , particularly in @entity11 where there are bars devoted to gin where customers choose their preferred gin , tonic and garnish			2
the @entity36 drinks company approached the @entity37 at the @entity38 which was looking at ways to promote cucumbers following the 2011 @entity42 crisis			0
they then asked farmers to grow the veg into the desired shape			0
bars in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 have been serving drinks with the heart - shaped cucumber , and the company says it will extend the cucumbers to @entity56 if they prove popular enough on the continent			2
romantic : the cucumbers are grown in heart - shaped moulds so that they look just right in your gin and tonic @entity62 , a @entity63 's spokesman , said : ' the giving of a red rose or sharing of a glass of bubbly are pleasant enough ways to mark @entity13			1
' but a gin and tonic complete with a most unusual garnish of heart - shaped cucumber slices is even better			1
' over the winter months , our cucumber plants have been slowly bearing their most marvellous fruit and hopefully their work will start a few @entity78 's celebrations off in @entity11			0

unusually - shaped veg are grown by @entity11 farmers in *plastic* heart moulds
