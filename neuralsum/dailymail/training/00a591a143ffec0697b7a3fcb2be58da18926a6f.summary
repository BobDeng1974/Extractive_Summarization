by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 29 july 2013 can @entity3 ’s @entity2 do for gyms what he ’s done for planes ? he ’s trying to			2
this month saw the launch of the eighth @entity8 , its flagship branch in a space formerly occupied by a @entity10 in @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
but while @entity10 membership cost £ 70 a month , @entity8 is just £ 19.99 ( in the new @entity12 branch — the others cost from £ 15.99 a month ) , with no joining fee or contract			1
sounds too good to be true ? if @entity19 are anything like @entity21 , i expect them to be sweaty , cramped and full of hidden costs			0
@entity0 puts @entity8 's latest offering to the test and aside from the orange colour scheme and prison - style changing rooms , she is more than impressed indeed , the price you see is n’t necessarily the price you pay			1
fancy doing classes ? it ’ll cost you an extra £ 11.99 a month			1
want to watch tv on the treadmill ? that ’s another £ 1.99 per month			2
inside , it ’s orange and functional			0
i had n’t expected piles of fluffy towels , but it seems privacy comes at a premium , too			0
while it sounds good value , it 'll cost you an extra £ 11.99 a month to do classes and £ 1.99 per month for tv on the treadmill @entity0 was amazed by the exercise machines , saying they had the most sophisticated entertainment system she 'd ever seen in a gym the changing rooms are communal with the barest of facilities — like a prison			1
with just ten showers and about 300 lockers , i ’d expect queues			0
but then i step onto the gym floor and my jaw drops			2
i ’d assumed they ’d have kept all the old @entity10 stuff and painted the place orange but there ’s more than 14,500 sq ft of space , packed with new high - quality machinery and fitness gear			1
the main machines feature the most sophisticated entertainment system i ’ve ever seen in a gym			2
not only can you choose from more than 70 tv channels , but you can surf the web and plug in your @entity75 to watch your own films			0
@entity0 was less than impressed with the prison style communal changing rooms but the high quality gym equipment made up for it not only can you choose from more than 70 tv channels , but you can surf the web and plug in your @entity75 to watch your own films whilst working out every exercise craze is catered for , from a @entity82 to @entity84 balls ( air - filled domes used for balancing )			1
there are group induction sessions every hour , but a personalised programme with a trainer will cost at least £ 25			0
and they know their stuff			0
@entity92 , who puts me through my paces , trained a 2012 @entity96 wrestler and promises me a ‘ head - turning , curvy , @entity99 - bottle body ’ in three weeks ( if i give up booze )			0
there are group induction sessions every hour , but a personalised programme with a trainer will cost at least £ 25 on top of the other fees the trainers really know their stuff here and @entity92 put @entity0 through her paces it ’s impressive and if i worked locally , i ’d be tempted to join , although let ’s see if it ’s quite so shiny in a few months ’ time			0
ultimately i applaud @entity2 for opening up the world of high - spec gyms to a wider audience			1
although , while i ’m at it , might i suggest that the man himself could benefit from a session or two with @entity92 ? @entity0 was ultimately really impressed by the new gym , which has taken over @entity10 's old space			2

@entity8 launched in @entity12
£ 19.99 with extra £ 11.99 for classes
changing rooms ' like prisons ' but gym space vast and high - quality machines
just like @entity3 , you pay extra for add - ons like tv on treadmills
