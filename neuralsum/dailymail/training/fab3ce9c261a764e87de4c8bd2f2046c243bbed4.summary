@entity1 's suspect defensive line was always going to be ' found out ' and ultimately prove their undoing at the @entity3 , according to former midfielder @entity4			1
the @entity1 were put on the brink of an early plane back from @entity7 following a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity9 in @entity10 on thursday night , where @entity12 striker @entity11 netted a late winner after @entity15 's equaliser			1
it was a second @entity17 loss and @entity1 's exit will be confirmed should @entity19 fail to beat @entity20 on friday			1
writing in his blog for @entity39 , former @entity37 star @entity4 said : ' going into the tournament we all feared the back four were never not going to concede goals - and now it has been proven			1
' there is no way you can blame @entity25 for not getting more on the ball from a header in the middle of the park for @entity11 's second goal			1
the defenders did n't sense the danger			0
' @entity36 is close to finding something - but he needs two young centre - halves that have the balls to play , the balls to step into midfield now and again and full - backs who can defend			0
' we have got two full - backs now in @entity62 and @entity63 who are great going forward - but we 've got great forwards already			1
we need solid defenders and we 're not blessed with great talent in this area			0
' not bringing @entity69 was probably a mistake - not so much for his attacking qualities - but more his defensive ones			2
wrong choice ? would @entity69 ( r ) have provided better defensive cover than @entity62 ? ' i think @entity62 and the whole of the back four have been found out a bit			1
it has been argued that @entity80 could have steadied the ship and taken command - but he 's not getting any younger either			0
' ideally what was needed was a young @entity80 and a @entity84 in his prime to marshal the defence			0
' @entity4 , 39 , feels @entity88 starlet @entity87 , who impressed again when coming off the bench against @entity9 , should start against @entity20 , in what could well be a dead rubber			1
' i have said before that he 'd be in my team but play him in the centre like he does for @entity88 - not out wide as a replacement for @entity95 , " @entity4 added			2
boy wonder : @entity4 has backed @entity87 ( r ) to start @entity1 's next game against @entity20 ' he 'd be a direct replacement for @entity99			1
he 's a good lad and has done okay , but has nowhere near the quality that @entity87 has			2
' the @entity88 man would be a perfect fit for that central midfield role and would take a lot of the heavy lifting off @entity25 's shoulders			2
' he can play off @entity25 , bomb forward , beat a man - give and take a pass			0
he 'd be ideal for @entity15 too and they could strike up a good partnership			0
' ' there 's also @entity113			0
let 's see how he handles the big occasion			0
the sad thing is it may be too little too late now to make these changes			0

@entity1 defence to blame for losing to @entity9 , claims @entity4
@entity1 on the brink of exit after @entity11 scored twice in 2 - 1 win
@entity25 not at fault for @entity11 's winner , says @entity4
@entity69 may have provided better cover than @entity62
@entity87 should start @entity1 's final game against @entity20
