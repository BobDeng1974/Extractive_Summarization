by @entity0 troubled discount retailer @entity1 need look no further than the state of the shelves in its own stores to comprehend its huge $ 2 billion loss in @entity6 since opening there in 2013			1
launching north of the border with much fanfare last year , the embattled one - stop - shopping giant appears to have fundamental problems simply keeping its shelves adequately stocked - judging by these stark and miserable pictures taken at an unidentified @entity6 @entity1 outlet			1
having already endured the disastrous aftermath of losing millions of customer 's credit information to a data - breach before @entity20 , which cost ceo @entity21 his job , @entity1 's profits are down 46 - percent this last quarter			1
empty : it may have been a good day at the @entity1 store , but judging by the equally unstocked shelves behind it seems they have just been left untended indeed , the photographs of empty clothing racks , and shelves boasting ' unbeatable prices ' on non-existent merchandise , suggest that @entity1 's goal of generating $ 6 billion a year in sales in @entity6 by 2017 is an optimistic goal			1
in some instances the store 's @entity6 display 's resemble a flea market in terms of organization and with traditional strong performers at the bedding department and toys woefully understocked			2
market experts have scratched their heads as to why the discount chain is suffering so badly in @entity6			2
the launch in 2013 was huge , even for a firm boasting revenue of $ 72 billion and more than 300,000 staff across the @entity50 and @entity6			1
nothing to see or sell : shelves in the unidentified @entity1 store in @entity6 seem depressingly empty let down : bedding is usually one of @entity1 's best sellers - although you would n't be able to tell from this picture which shows a woefully understocked shelf renowned for its ' cheap chic ' , @entity1 opened 123 stores in @entity6 and the first mistake they made is claimed to be buying out the premises of the now defunct @entity66 chain , whose store leases it bought in 2011 for $ 1.8 billion			1
the trouble with that was , the stores were often smaller than those in the @entity50 , and found in down - market malls rather than up - and - coming retail destinations			0
some analysts said that @entity1 's @entity6 woes began with that while the company 's inability to stock the stores with items @entity6 want at the prices they expected is what ultimately alienated customers			1
indeed , it seems in some cases @entity1 is not even stocking the shelves with any items , let alone products @entity6 do not even want			1
no toys for the kids : rows of empty and mismanaged model cars and the latest games for children write caption here ' @entity6 were expecting the @entity50 @entity1 experience , ' said @entity98 , president of @entity99 in @entity100			1
' instead they got @entity66 with lipstick			0
' @entity6 shoppers also complain that prices are higher than they thought they would be , that there 's inadequate selection of goods on the shelves , and that the company 's supply chains do n't meet the expectations drummed up by its advertising			1
' for @entity1 , every time they have something on sale in the flyer , they do n't have it when you get to the store , ' said @entity121 , 31 , who was shopping at a @entity100 @entity122 with her toddler			2
@entity100 interior designer @entity124 , 40 , shopping at a @entity1 store where some shelves were oddly barren of merchandise , said , ' i was here within the first week when it opened , and i was so disappointed			1
we were expecting what we saw in the @entity50			0
' it wo n't be easy for @entity1 to sweeten the sour first impression it has made on @entity6 shoppers , who were familiar with the retailer 's @entity50 stores and expected more selection and better prices			1
' they over-promised and under - delivered and they 're wearing two big shiners for it , ' said @entity145 , chief executive of consultancy @entity146 and director of the @entity148 at @entity150 's @entity149			0
hq : this is the @entity1 store and training facility in @entity154 , @entity155 - ( not the store featured in the photographs ) not fully stocked : @entity158 is a mainstay of children 's toy merchandise running low : @entity1 reported in february that its fourth - quarter profit fell 46 percent on a revenue decline of 5.3 percent as the breach scared off customers @entity1 says it 's working on the problems , though fixing them may take time			1
' again , it 's not done , it 's not perfect , and it 's not everyday , '' said @entity169 , a @entity1 spokesman			2
' on any given day , in any given time , we think it 's incrementally better than it was several weeks ago , several months ago and that 's what we 're looking for			0
' the company expects $ 300 million to $ 400 million in capital spending in @entity6 this year , down from the peak of more than $ 1 billion in 2013 , to fix the stores , @entity178 , @entity1 's former chief financial officer and now interim chief executive , said in february			1
@entity178 said last year that the stores were in very poor condition , with $ 10 million to $ 11 million in renovations expected for each location			2
it 's an investment that may yet pay off with customers who laud the clean stores and customer service they are used to in the @entity50 ' i settle for a few items that i can get here rather than go somewhere else like @entity122 , ' said @entity191 , a little person who needs help reaching high shelves , as she shopped at a @entity1 in @entity100			1
' i wo n't go to @entity122 unless i need to			0
it 's unorganized and no one can ever assist me			0
' spot one : there are scant opportunities on these shelves to pick up any merchandise , let alone get 70 percent off the product but @entity191 , a government worker , also still shops at @entity1 in the @entity50 once a month , saying the furniture , clothing and household selection is better than it is in @entity6			1
@entity6 are used to paying more for goods than in the @entity50 and the disparity is more or less tolerated			2
it is often blamed on currency fluctuations , taxes , tariffs and transportation costs			0
@entity211 , 26 , a stay - at - home mother of two , shopping with her infant son , said she likes @entity1 because it is conveniently located and has good products , but she finds the shelves are often empty			2
' this one is more expensive			0
also , there are a lot of people near here , so you have to be the first to grab things , if you 're late you 'll miss it , it 's gone , ' she said			0
' my son has colic , and we need gripe water , and it 's never in stock			0
it has been three weeks , and there is no gripe water -- we want the right kind			0
we end up running all over looking for it , and come back here a few times but it is never in stock			0
' still , there is hope fashionistas drawn by @entity1 's reputation as a treasure trove for fun , cheap clothes and higher - quality merchandise than @entity122 may extend their patience a little longer			2
it 's just up to @entity1 to deliver			0
@entity121 , the @entity122 shopper , said she gave @entity1 five or six tries when it first opened , and may give it another			0
' the only thing i like at @entity1 , why i may go back , is their sheets , ' she said			0
' they do have good quality bedding			0
