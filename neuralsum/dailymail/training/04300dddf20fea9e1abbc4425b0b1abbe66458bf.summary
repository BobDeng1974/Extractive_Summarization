two days after being sacked as @entity2 's one - day cricket captain , @entity0 put his troubles behind him to return to sporting action – and duly showed his prowess by scoring two superb centuries with ease			1
the only problem was that he was doing so with a dart not a bat in his hand – and , in a far cry from the pristine surroundings of @entity14 's , the audience he was playing to was full of drunk punters wearing @entity17 jumpers … as well as a couple of reindeer in the stands			0
the 29 - year - old , who is still @entity2 's @entity22 captain , took to the @entity24 stage in north @entity25 on monday evening , shortly before the start of day five of the @entity27 , for an entertaining ' challenge ' match with @entity2 fast bowler @entity29			1
@entity29 ( left ) took on @entity0 ( right ) in a one - leg challenge at @entity24 @entity31 meets @entity32 : @entity0 vs @entity29 and , in spite of his recent woes , @entity0 enjoyed a rare moment of sporting triumph in this one - leg shootout			1
' i was nervous up there , ' admitted @entity0 , who held his stag party a few years ago at @entity24 with a group of mates			1
' i scored a 100 up there – and it 's the first time i have done that on tv for a while			0
it was amazing up there but my legs were shaking			0
' knowing how keen the players are on their arrows during overseas tours , the @entity50 approached the @entity54 a few months back to arrange this special invitational match			0
@entity0 competed in the challenge match just days after being stripped of @entity2 's one - day captaincy @entity2 bowler @entity29 makes his way to the stage after being introduced at @entity24 the @entity22 captain celebrates a victory on stage against his team - mate @entity29 what the @entity65 cricket authorities could not have anticipated was that the match would take place days after the decision to demote @entity0 from the @entity70 squad and strip him of the captaincy because of his poor scoring form			1
nonetheless , @entity0 , who is 30 on christmas day , still turned up to participate			2
he did the full walk - on , wearing a t - shirt with ' @entity75 ' emblazed on his back			0
@entity29 rightly used the moniker ' @entity78 '			2
@entity0 admitted to being nervous on the @entity24 stage to the point where his legs were shaking @entity29 and @entity0 regularly play darts while on a cricket tour with @entity2 in the practice room beforehand , @entity0 had achieved a 13 - dart leg and he brought that form to the oche			1
throwing with his right , despite being a left - handed batsman , @entity0 scored a 100 and 140 – and despite missing seven darts at double 13 he eventually sealed the match with a double 11 attempt			2
@entity0 might not be playing at the @entity70 in @entity93 and @entity94 in february – but perhaps the @entity70 of @entity32 in @entity95 in the summer would be a viable option instead			0
the pair shake hands after their contest on monday night at the @entity100 in @entity25			0
