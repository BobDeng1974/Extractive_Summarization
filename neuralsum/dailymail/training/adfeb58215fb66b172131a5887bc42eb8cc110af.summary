@entity0 is developing artificial intelligence software to help users decide what they should and should n't upload to the social network			1
the software could even warn users if someone else uploads a snap of them , @entity0 has revealed			1
it hopes the software will ' mediate ' users interactions with their friends			1
@entity0 hopes to create a digital assistant that will be able to analyse everything you upload			1
if it thinks something is embarrassing or even illegal , it will be able to warn users			2
it will also monitor other uploads , and spot when someone else uploads an embarrassing picture , for instance			0
' imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on @entity0 , ' the head of the @entity30 , @entity29 , told @entity36			1
his project hopes to analyse everything uploaded to the social network , from video to pictures			1
' you need a machine to really understand content and understand people and be able to hold all that data , ' he says			0
' that is an ai - complete problem			0
' he also envisions a @entity0 that instantly notifies you when someone you do n't know posts your photo to the social network without your approval			1
' you will have a single point of contact to mediate your interaction but also to protect your private information , ' he says			1
@entity29 also revealed this team has discussed the project with @entity58 , the @entity60 headset firm recently acquired by facebook , and was also thinking about working with robotics fimrs in the future			2
his team has been working on the project since 2013 , when the social networking giant has teamed up with @entity67 to set up a research lab designed to learn about artificial intelligence			0
this could include things like ranking ( the items in ) news feeds , or determining the ads that are shown to users , to be more relevant , ' @entity29 said when the project was first announced			2
@entity29 also revealed this team has discussed the project with @entity58 , the @entity60 headset firm recently acquired by facebook , and was also thinking about working with robotics fimrs in the future			2
' then there are things that are less directly connected , like analyzing content , understanding natural language and being able to model users ... to allow them to learn new things , entertain them and help them achieve their goals			0
' @entity29 said the new artificial intelligence lab would be the largest research facility of its kind in the world , though he declined to provide numbers			0
' we 're limited only by how many smart people there are in the world that we can hire , ' the @entity97 - born mathematician and computer scientist said			0
the lab is be based in three locations -- @entity104 , @entity106 and @entity0 's headquarters in @entity107 , @entity108			2
@entity29 , the founding director of @entity67 's @entity109 , is known for creating an early version of a pattern - recognition algorithm that mimics in part the visual cortex of animals and humans			0
@entity29 's recent research projects include the application of ' deep learning ' methods for visual scene understanding , driverless cars and small flying robots , as well as speech recognition , and applications in biology and medicine .			0

@entity0 has spent a year developing the @entity129 assistant
will stop users posting *illicit* pictures and ' mediate ' their interaction
firm has build huge @entity129 labs around the world to make project a reality
