sending yourself flowers from your imaginary boyfriend is a thing of the past			2
whether you are lonely or just plain sick of explaining why you are single , the @entity5 ( or @entity6 ) app created by @entity7 and @entity8 allows users to experience the fake relationships of their dreams			1
for $ 24.99 a month you can immediately feel the effects of a rewarding virtual partner with the app designed to send users texts , voicemails and even a handwritten note from the perfect person that they created			1
when @entity23 learned that the @entity25 - based app had launched in @entity26 today , we knew we had to try it			1
first up , i had to pick my lover 's name and age			2
i soon learned that choosing your boyfriend 's name is stressful			1
i imagine that i took the same amount of time someone would take to name their first born son before finally settling on the moniker : @entity41			1
age was easier to dream up			0
my current boyfriend is nine months younger than me , which he never lets me forget			2
with that in mind , i made my new partner an older , more mature 33 years old			2
i was then prompted to pick a photo that would represent @entity41 's appearance			1
i settled on the stock photo of a man with an attractive amount of facial scruff and moved on			0
after dealing with the physical , i was asked about my virtual partner 's personality and interests			1
i knew i wanted him to be ' witty and educated , ' so it made sense for him to also be interested in books , sports and chess			0
for one fleeting moment , i thought he might be able to teach me how to play the board game			0
next , i was asked to describe how @entity41 and i met			1
this was my moment to create a @entity87 - inspired rom com , but instead , i wrote that we grabbed the same book that was on display at the bookstore			0
did i mention this app is thorough ? invisible man : the website allows you to choose your boyfriend 's age , location and personal interests total babe : for $ 24.99 a month , you can start an imaginary relationship with one of these anonymous men , whose photos are available on the app 's website as soon as i reached the end of the questionnaire , i received my first text message from @entity41 of @entity110 , @entity111			1
his phone number even had an actual @entity110 area code			1
' hey @entity38 ! this is @entity41 : ) how are you ? ' he wrote			1
ugh , i hate when guys use emoticons			0
although i had no idea who i was texting , it was clear that there was a real , albeit mysterious , person having casual conversation with me			0
when i told him i was working , he immediately took interest in the story i was writing , which was actually sweet			0
since i do n't live with my new boyfriend , i asked him if he wanted to hang out			2
after some brief hesitation on his end , i decided to test his limits and start nagging him			0
' what is taking you so long to answer ? ' i asked			0
he quickly bypassed the argument i was trying to start by saying he would ' love ' to hang out , considerately asking what i wanted to do			0
extracurricular activities : the website gives you the option to tailor his personality and lifestyle according to your own interests and needs magic man : ' @entity41 ' actually referenced the first time he and @entity38 ' met ' in one of the text messages he had sent ' i dunno			1
i am sick of making plans , ' i texted back			0
' what do you want to do ? ' @entity41 then suggested we order takeout and have a game night before noting that we can also grab dinner later if i wanted			1
it occurred to me that my last ' date night ' with my human boyfriend involved us watching tv in separate rooms			2
i wanted to learn more about my mystery man , so i asked @entity41 to remind me where he worked again			1
' i work for a publishing company , ' he replied			2
' remember i told you at the bookstore ? ' @entity41 is so perfect that he even remembers the first place we met			1
realizing that my new boyfriend deals with books all day , i asked him to recommend a good a thriller that i could read in his absence - and that 's where i lost him			1
i am not sure if my question was too thought - provoking , but i started to feel a familiar panic			0
' why is n't he answering me ? ' i thought			0
make believe : the app will create a story to explain how you and your fake partner first met multiple uses : users are asked why they want to have an invisible boyfriend at one point , i even caught myself drafting messages that i wanted to send to him but then deleted - just as if he were a real guy who was ignoring me			1
i eventually tried to win him back , texting : ' i 'm sorry			0
i know you hate when i ask you questions at work , but i miss you boo			0
' and i got nothing			0
@entity41 and i broke up before i could even ask him where our relationship was going			1
i actually had a great time talking to my imaginary boyfriend , and it was nice to know that i could easily win @entity41 back with a quick payment of $ 24.99			1
while it is fun to use , the app was created to alleviate the society 's pressure to be in a relationship by allowing to make it look like they are			1
mr. @entity7 explained that he came up with the idea when he was newly divorced and tired of being pushed to start dating again			1
" around @entity211 , my mom called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone i ’m bringing , ” he recalled on the app 's website			2
rain check ? while users are able to make plans with their boyfriends , the date is obviously never going to happen ' in that moment i realized how great it would be to have an answer for her that did n't require me to actually be dating someone			2
' even if you are currently dating , the @entity224 apps allow you to work on your texting skills by having you interact with another human			2
and if the person you are with is n't ready to commit ? you can easily invent a person who is trying to steal you away			0
in the technological age , there seems to be an app for all of your romantic needs			0
in 2012 , conflicted women were able to download the should i break up with my boyfriend ? app in order to figure out if they should stay with their partner or end their relationships			2
coincidentally , the following year saw the creation of @entity242 , an app that offers multiple options for users to end their relationships electronically with little to no fuss			0
and then 2014 was the year of the @entity247			0
lazy men around the world rejoiced when they learned of the electronic tool that pre-programs and sends text message to women , so they will feel adequately adored .			0
