@entity0 , just 19 years old , looked calmly at the police officer who had just asked where the neighbour she had idolised for years was , and answered matter of factly that she was dead			1

' i said " listen are you sure that she 's dead ? is there no way we can help her ? " she told me that she 'd buried @entity54 on a family country property near where she 'd buried other pets '			1

what emerged from the police investigation into @entity31 death was an incredible and tragic tale of obsession , resentment and murder			2
from the age of 14 , @entity14 watched @entity31 and came to be jealous of what she saw as her neighbour 's perfect life compared to hers			1
@entity31 was an avid dance student , outgoing , well - liked ; @entity14 was overweight , depressive and had few friends			1
@entity14 worked her way into @entity31 's life , using her own younger sister , who was school friends with one of @entity31 's , becoming a babysitter for @entity31 's parents			1
she lured @entity31 to her apartment on february 28 , 1999 , with the promise of $ 100 to take part in a ' psychological study '			2
the 19 - year - old drugged and strangled her victim , then stuffed her body in a closet			2
@entity14 went to work the next day , and when she returned she wrapped the body in a blanket and rented a truck to take it to the farm to bury it			2
she later applied for a loan , money police later alleged she intended to use to flee @entity97			0
@entity31 's devastated parents refused to believe their daughter had run away and launched a public campaign to find her			2
police eventually discovered the link between @entity14 and @entity31 on the day the murdered girl disappeared			1
when police went to @entity14 's apartment , they found her semi-conscious on the floor after suffering an epileptic fit			2

her victim 's sister , @entity119 , told @entity45 ' it would not surprise me in the least when she gets out , [ if ] she targets me or my sister			1
' ' i 'm just like , you want to see what i look like ? go for it			0
i mean , i 'm not scared of you , why should i have to stop my life and hide away because you 're a crazy ? ' exclusive footage of the police interview , obtained by @entity45 , shows an unresponsive and evasive @entity14 who refused to give any more information			1
' did you bury her at your father 's property at @entity133 ' a policeman can be heard asking @entity14 , who responds : ' i do n't want to answer any questions '			1
' @entity0 's very cold , very matter of fact , but just very cold			1
there 's no emotion there whatsoever			0
absolutely calculating , ' mr @entity23 said			0
' there is evidence of planning			0
@entity0 clearly planned this out			2
this was a premeditated murder			0
it 's not spur of the moment and it 's certainly not passion , ' superintendent @entity23 said ' some people might change their behaviour , their appearance , their job , their lifestyle , so they can be like their role model			0
but to actually want to kill the role model and replace them , i mean that 's going really a long way , ' forensic psychiatrist @entity156 said ' there is evidence of planning			0
@entity0 clearly planned this out			2
this was a premeditated murder			0
it 's not spur of the moment and it 's certainly not passion			0
' it 's unbelievable that she would not recall what had occurred or know that she involved in the murder of @entity15			2
' forensic psychiatrist @entity156 told @entity45 that cases like @entity14 's , in which a teenager kills an idol in order to steal their identity , were completely ' unheard of '			1
' some people might change their behaviour , their appearance , their job , their lifestyle , so they can be like their role model			0
but to actually want to kill the role model and replace them , i mean that 's going really a long way , ' dr @entity156 said			0
' this is clearly an extreme case			0
i mean you can see a bit of fantasising in most teenagers , but to see someone going out of their way to kill their victim , to replace them , that 's really unique			0
' @entity0 ( middle ) walked free from jail in january , 16 years after strangling a 15 - year - old girl to death in a plot to steal her identity ' i think that @entity0 was very unhappy with herself : she did n't like the way she looked			1
she did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy , that was beautiful , that was popular like @entity15 was and try and live that life , ' mr @entity23 said mr @entity23 said there was no doubt in his mind about @entity14 's motivation			1
' i think that @entity0 was very unhappy with herself : she did n't like the way she looked			0
she did want to take on that persona of someone that was happy , that was beautiful , that was popular like @entity15 was and try and live that life , ' he said			0
' you and i can sit here and say well that 's just not possible , but certainly that 's what she wanted to do and that is absolutely my belief of why she took @entity15 's life			2
' following her release last month , the @entity31 family asked the public not to harass @entity14 , but give her ' the opportunity to quietly readjust to life outside of prison '			1
the family hope that @entity14 , who suffers from a personality disorder , will be properly rehabilitated and supervised during her parole so she is not a danger to society			1
@entity14 had a deep - rooted self loathing , as demonstrated in this self - portrait which was used as evidence in her trial			0
at age 14 she drew this exaggeratedly ugly image of herself surrounded by degrading words in another image @entity14 drew of herself , it is clear that she has very low self confidence and is obsessed with her appearance			0
it is believed that jealousy and obsession was the reasoning for the murder of @entity15 @entity14 's diary entries were used by police as evidence in the trial			1
' how to change in nine weeks ' was written by @entity14 on the front of her journal ; the pages inside detail her sick plans			0
they reveal the disturbed woman 's terrifying obsession with the beautiful dancer as she plotted to kill and ' disfigure ' the teen			0
the journal and emotional letters to her father also expose the intense self - loathing @entity14 felt , which led her to became fixated with @entity54 , a pretty , talented , well - liked dance student			1
@entity14 had grown up disgusted by herself , frequently painting disgusting self - portraits and scribbling hateful words about herself			0
' loser , unwanted , dirty , obese , funny in the head , ' she wrote around one drawing when she was 14 years old			0
' i do n't belong anywhere in this crazy world because i 'm ugly , obese , pizza face , white worm , massive nose and just plain weird			0
