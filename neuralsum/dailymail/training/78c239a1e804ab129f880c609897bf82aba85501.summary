it is officially ' @entity1 ' in the @entity2 , just in time for @entity3 to pull on his baggy pants and perform ' @entity7 ' at the @entity6 karaoke			1
now , that really would mark a full cycle in @entity11 ’s wheel of fortune			1
twelve months ago , @entity3 was under the cosh			1
his team were ensconced in the bottom three , his squad was creaking at the seams under a pile - up of injuries and supporters were groaning at the style of football he was delivering			2
things would get worse as @entity3 ’s beleaguered team lost 5 - 0 with a weakened team in the @entity25 at @entity26 and were thrashed by six at @entity27 , three days later			1
@entity11 are flying as @entity28 celebrates scoring @entity11 's second goal against @entity30 on sunday but the manager dug in , the board declined to sack him , despite many rumours to the contrary , and today @entity11 are getting comfy in the @entity36 places			1
here , @entity37 discovers exactly what has changed for the @entity11 over the past year			1
the players the most obvious change is that the club have better players available			2
for one , they do not have the injuries they were suffering from last season			0
@entity28 ’s return to fitness is a major boost , as there is no - one quite like him in the @entity2			1
more importantly , they have bolstered the squad with a distinct upgrade in quality			0
@entity55 and @entity56 , both signed on loan , were outstanding in the 3 - 1 win against @entity30 , the third victory on the bounce			1
on sunday , against @entity30 , there were only three survivors from the team beaten 4 - 1 at @entity65 on december 7 , 2013			1
former @entity66 man @entity55 has brought @entity67 to the @entity11 midfield @entity69 came off the bench to fire @entity11 into a 3 - 1 lead at @entity72 on sunday @entity73 miles @entity11 105.7 65.7 @entity74 90 10,8 6.7 @entity75 90 10.6 6.6 @entity76 90 10.2 6.3 @entity55 has stabilised the midfield and added quality on the ball			1
he seems a better player since returning from @entity66 , more patient in possession , and not so reckless			0
he linked up well with @entity56 , marauding forward from right - back			0
@entity84 has stepped easily up to the top level and provides balance on the left			0
up front both @entity88 and @entity69 have settled immediately , something which always involves a little chance			1
you need a bit of luck along the way			0
how much @entity3 knew about @entity95 and @entity69 is debatable – co-owner @entity96 always loves to gamble on a striker - but they have proved inspired			1
@entity69 ’s goal against @entity30 was his eighth in 10 games in all competitions ( he 's scored seven in the @entity2 ) and he seems perfect for the @entity105 top flight			1
he works hard and preys on mistakes			0
he is quick enough so that defenders do not get back with a recovery tackles			0
and his finishing , thus far , has been clinical			0
summer signing @entity69 has now scored seven goals in nine @entity2 games for the @entity11 the @entity2 table in 1999 when the @entity11 were third with the likes of @entity115 , and now ( below ) @entity11 striker @entity28 celebrates scoring his first league goal in 878 minutes of football @entity75 ( right ) is playing some of the best football of his career this season the coaches much has been made of @entity122 ’s influence , since he was appointed as a specialist coach to work with the strikers , and it is difficult to argue with the goals			1
@entity127 , @entity95 , @entity28 , @entity128 and @entity129 have all hit the target			1
@entity131 on @entity133 @entity132 was impressed by the subtleties of @entity28 ’s movement in the penalty box			2
@entity122 ’s great asset was the way he read the game			0
if he can get any of that across to the five strikers , he will improve them			0
it was also good to see @entity28 sprint to celebrate with the coaching team , and the medics who helped him through the dark days of recovery from injuries			2
@entity148 and togetherness will generate the spirit required to pull teams through when they are not playing so well , or when fortune turns against them			0
@entity3 has steered @entity11 to third in the @entity2 after 15 games @entity122 was appointed as a specialist coach to work with the @entity11 strikers this goes for the relationship between @entity3 and the boardroom , too			1
at the moment , all is calm			0
the signings have paid off and the manager ’s decisions are proving successful			0
they are entitled to feel smug			0
but there is still an undercurrent at the club that this is not a natural fit , with @entity3 at pains to point out his tactical brilliance at every opportunity while the owners point to the success of their signings and demand for the team to play with greater adventure			1
' we recruited a better calibre of player in the summer , who were chosen because they have the ability to play the @entity11 way , ' wrote @entity186 , in his programme notes for the @entity30 game			1
before the game , @entity3 was on tv talking about the possibility of a contract extension			2
perhaps a successful season will soothe this friction			0
@entity3 embraces @entity28 following the striker 's second goal of the game against @entity30 goals scored after 15 matches last season & this season ... @entity200 : 30 - 34 @entity27 : 32 - 32 @entity11 : 13 - 26 @entity65 : 34 - 19 @entity201 : 22 - 24 playing style the style has certainly changed for the better			1
@entity3 will insist this is because there are more and better players available			2
he is also entitled to credit for the shape of the team , and the switch to a midfield diamond which has allowed @entity75 to thrive			0
@entity11 appear committed to a core of @entity105 players and they are committed to attack , with two strikers and attacking full - backs to provide the width lost to the diamond			1
there were 36 cross delivered against @entity30 , which helped @entity28 wreak havoc			1
they have 26 goals , double the total they had after 15 @entity2 games last season			1
the @entity11 have been playing a more fluid style of football this season as the intricate passing and movement that led to @entity28 's first goal shows @entity3 's summer signings such as @entity69 and @entity95 have hit the ground running in midfield , besides the controlling influence of @entity55 and @entity236 ( under - rated and overlooked by @entity237 despite his ability in the midfield holding role ) , the energy of @entity242 has been important , although @entity74 covered more ground than anyone			1
without this industry and commitment in midfield , it is difficult to get away with two strikers in the modern game			0
at the back there are questions , which will eat away at @entity3 , a manager who likes to be solid			2
there will be times when the centre - halves are exposed by their ambitious full - backs , and will have to make decisions with no margin for error			0
they have conceded only 18 , so there is no cause for immediate alarm			0
goalkeeper @entity265 is not always totally convincing but has done well			0
the side has good physical presence and is dangerous from set - pieces , as @entity3 teams usually are			1
@entity74 has been under scrutiny from @entity11 fans this season , but covered more ground that any other player against @entity30 on sunday the @entity275 @entity28 adds something rare in the modern game , a genuine aerial threat , which can trigger panic among modern central defenders			1
@entity3 was right to lament the lost art. not only did he score twice against @entity30 , but he nodded headers down and created chances and chaos			1
by the end of the game , centre - halves @entity285 and @entity287 looked as if they might concede from every attack			0
he will be judged on goals but he also creates space for others			0
he supplied the flick for @entity69 ’s goal and the pass for @entity69 ’s run which tempted @entity299 into the challenge which earned him a red card			2
regardless of the debate about his transfer value , if @entity28 is fully fit , he is an enormous threat			2
no centre - half will want to mark him , especially if @entity11 can successfully keep 30 - plus crosses flying into his airspace			1
can he stay fit ? that is the key			0
@entity28 soars at the back post to head @entity56 's delivery across @entity299 and into the net @entity28 waves to the crowd as he celebrates with team - mates song , @entity95 and @entity74 @entity28 adds a a genuine aerial threat , which can trigger panic among modern central defenders the fans @entity72 was deathly quiet at times during the game against @entity30 , perhaps it was the nerves which came with the knowledge that a win would propel them to third place for the first time in 15 years			1
it made you wonder what the atmosphere might be like at the @entity329			0
maybe this is simply the changing face of football crowds : a bit more corporate and a bit more discerning			0
by the end , they were in full voice , cheering the goals and celebrating the win			2
presumably they enjoyed the style of football , although from behind the press box , there were desperate shouts to ' get it back in the box ' for @entity28 to head			2
at least for now they are not in open dissent as they were this time last year when the future seemed far less enticing			0
@entity28 applauds the home fans after @entity11 's 3 - 1 win against @entity355 's @entity30 side the future it looks very bright			1
certainly brighter than it did this time last year			0
but it will depend on how they build on this encouraging first four months of the season			0
@entity55 and @entity56 , two stand - out performers , are only on loan			1
history tells us that @entity28 ’s fitness is unreliable , as is @entity75 ’s form			2
but it is better to build from a position of success			0
with points on the board , it eases a pressure ; the team can play with freedom they do n’t have when scrapping against the drop			0
a stronger squad should help @entity3 ride the problems he is sure to face at some point			2
the @entity11 players celebrate a @entity75 goal against @entity383 in november qualify for @entity384 and it will tempt better players and help keep those who might be lured away			2
the plan was always to make sure @entity11 were in the @entity2 at the time when they moved to the new stadium			1
at this rate , they might be setting sights a little higher			0
@entity392 … the kit of course , there ’s transfers and tactics and spirit , etc. but what if it ’s all down to the kit ? @entity11 ’s shirts have a horizontal pinstripe with an 80s feel , similar to the design in 1985/86 when they finished third , only four points behind champions @entity65			2
@entity407 ( left ) sports the 1985/86 @entity11 kit , which resembles the current strip ( right )			2

@entity11 are third in the @entity2 table after 15 games
@entity28 scored twice during 3 - 1 win over @entity30 on sunday
@entity3 was *criticised* before he turned the club 's fortunes around
@entity69 has scored seven goals in nine @entity2 games
@entity55 has brought @entity67 to the @entity11 midfield
six *englishmen* started for the @entity11 against @entity30
