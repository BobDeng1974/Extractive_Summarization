by @entity0 as soon as @entity3 ’s son @entity2 was born , he had trouble breastfeeding			1
midwives at the hospital gave him formula milk , much to his mother ’s exasperation			0
‘ @entity2 ’s first feed was from a bottle , ’ says @entity3 , 42 , a tv producer from @entity10			1
‘ i was desperate to breastfeed , but they advised i should top up with formula because it was unlikely he was getting enough from me			2
it was frustrating , but i took their advice			0
’ @entity3 with her children @entity2 ( four ) and @entity21 ( two )			1
@entity22 always had trouble breast - feeding			0
@entity3 went to a breastfeeding counsellor who told her he was tongue - tied and this was the reason he was having trouble			1
' i could n't believe no one had checked before , ' she says for the next six weeks , @entity3 struggled to get her son to breastfeed			1
‘ it took hours because @entity2 could n’t latch on properly and get enough milk , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ he became frustrated and would bang his head against my chest			0
he ’d fall asleep during his lengthy feeds , but as soon as i put him down , he ’d wake up and want feeding again			0
’ to breastfeed , babies need to be able to stick their tongue forward to latch on			1
instead , @entity2 would chomp with his gums , which is ineffective and incredibly painful for the mother			0
as a result , @entity3 had three bouts of mastitis , where the breast tissue becomes painful and inflamed , as well as nipple thrush , which in turn gave @entity2 oral thrush			1
however , a simple check carried out when @entity2 was six weeks old changed everything			0
‘ i ’d seen my gp at least four times and @entity2 was given treatment for colic and reflux , which causes stomach cramps and vomiting in babies — neither of which he had , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ after six weeks , i went to a breastfeeding counsellor and the first thing she did was put her finger in @entity2 ’s mouth			0
she told me he was tongue - tied and this was the reason he was having trouble			1
i could n’t believe no one had checked before			0
’ like many people , @entity3 had never heard of the condition			1
in fact , tongue - tie is thought to affect one in five babies — it ’s where the frenulum , the string - like skin under the tongue , is too short			1
this restricts movement , making breastfeeding difficult or impossible			0
it can also lead to speech problems			1
@entity3 with her children @entity2 ( four , right ) and @entity21 ( two , left )			1
her sons , like one in five babies , were both born with tongue tie which often prevents them from breastfeeding because they can not latch on properly tongue - tied children may be messy eaters and have dental problems because the tongue is unable to remove food debris from the teeth			1
many adults are tongue - tied without realising it			1
it is thought to be inherited from the father and is more common in boys			0
the condition can be diagnosed easily by feeling for the tightness of the frenulum			0
babies with tongue - tie tend to have heart - shaped tongues because the middle is pulled in by the short frenulum , and they can not stick out their tongue beyond their lower lip			1
signs of the condition in newborns include gulping and clicking while breastfeeding because they ca n’t latch on properly			0
most tongue - tied babies can bottle feed because the teat goes right into the mouth			1
breast - feeding is seen as preferable to bottle - feeding by many experts as it is known to protect babies from stomach upsets , chest infections , allergies , sudden infant death syndrome and obesity and may even boost @entity123			0
it has also been shown to reduce a woman ’s risk of breast cancer and can help her bond with a newborn			0
the @entity130 recommends giving babies only breast milk for the first six months of life — mothers are offered £ 200 in vouchers if they reach this milestone			0
however , while 69 per cent of women breastfeed their baby at birth , this falls to 23 per cent by six weeks , with just 1 per cent reaching the six - month target			1
according to @entity143 , a consultant paediatric ear , nose and throat surgeon at the @entity147 , @entity10 , breastfeeding rates could be improved if tongue - tie was treated			1
tongue - tie is thought to affect one in five @entity151 ¿ s where the frenulum , the string - like skin under the tongue , is too short			1
this restricts movement , making breastfeeding difficult or impossible indeed , research published in the @entity160 in 2005 found treating tongue - tie led to improved feeding in 95 per cent of babies			1
‘ the procedure to release the tongue is quick , cheap and can relieve distress for the mother and baby , ’ says mrs @entity143			0
tongue - tie can be cured easily with a snip of the stringy membrane to release the tongue — an operation called a frenulotomy			2
cutting the frenulum takes just a minute			0
the procedure involves a tiny amount of blood loss and , in many cases , allows breastfeeding immediately			0
even if babies are diagnosed , there are only 16 @entity183 centres offering treatment and waiting lists can be lengthy			0
the @entity186 is campaigning for tongue - tie treatment in every maternity unit			2
@entity3 was told she would have to wait two months for an @entity183 appointment because the gp did n’t consider her case urgent as @entity2 could take a bottle , so she went private			2
@entity3 with her children @entity21 , left , and @entity2 , right			2
after @entity195 s experience of tongue - tie with @entity2 , now aged four , she checked her second son @entity21 as soon as he was born two years ago and he too was tongue - tie however , some argue that many babies with the condition will not need treatment			1
‘ the vast majority of children with tongue - tie will have a mild to moderate form , ’ says dr @entity203 , a neonatal consultant at @entity204 and vice president of the @entity206			2
‘ @entity211 will be able to breastfeed and so surgery is not necessary			0
but if the mother is having difficulty breastfeeding and other interventions have not helped , a tongue - tie division is a possible course of action			2
’ while complications of tongue - tie surgery are rare , if the procedure were to be carried out on every child with the condition , ‘ we will end up seeing complications in children who did n’t really need it ’			1
what doctors do agree on is that tongue - tie went out of fashion medically for several decades , effectively disappearing as a diagnosis			2
mrs @entity143 believes it stems back to the introduction of formula milk in the @entity236			0
‘ all babies used to be breastfed			0
then it was thought to be unhygienic and unreliable , so went out of fashion and most babies were bottle fed , ’ she says			0
medical students were not taught about tongue - tie and it disappeared from text books because it was thought to be a cosmetic issue			2
‘ in the past , checking for this condition was routine after birth — if tongue - tie was found , the midwife would divide it there and then			1
‘ now little importance is placed on it			0
when an edition of the @entity256 was dedicated to breastfeeding , there was no mention of tongue - tie			2
’ after @entity3 ’s experience with @entity2 , now aged four , and discovering her partner @entity261 and his father were tongue - tied , too , she checked her second son @entity21 as soon as he was born two years ago and diagnosed tongue - tie			1
she decided to have his operation done privately , both sons ’ treatment came to £ 170			0
‘ because @entity2 was n’t checked for tongue - tie earlier , his first few weeks were traumatic , ’ she says			2
‘ parents are not taught about tongue - tie at ante - natal classes , yet an early diagnosis can make such a difference			2
we need to change that			0

the string - like skin under the tongue , is too short , restricting movement
it can prevent *ability* to breastfeed and even can lead to speech problems
both sons of @entity3 , 42 , from @entity10 , suffer from rare condition
