by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 5 july 2013 must accept : a partial list of the permissions demanded fro the users by the app. these were enough to discourage rapper @entity5 from downloading despite being named after the landmark document securing expanded liberties for free men in @entity11 , @entity7 's new album thwarts modern - day technological freedoms			1
an essay by @entity14 in the @entity15 friday detailed the odious process of downloading @entity7 's ' @entity18 ' album on a @entity20 phone , and all of the privacy settings listeners would have to give up in order to listen to it			1
@entity20 bought one million copies of @entity7 's latest album to release to certain @entity20 device owners three days before the actual release			1
in order to receive the first downloads , all you needed to do was download the @entity31 ' @entity7 @entity32 ' from the @entity34 app store			2
but then a pop - up lists all of the app permissions you must accept in order to listen to the album			2
by downloading the app you agree to let it modify or delete items in the storage on your phone and access your location on @entity45			1
it also gathers information on the email addresses and social media accounts associated with your phone			1
the app requires @entity51 and @entity52 logins because , as one @entity7 spokesman said , ' we would like fans to share the content through social networking sites			1
' emails and phone calls to @entity20 's public relations team were not immediately returned to @entity61			2
rapper @entity5 saw the all of the permissions requests and tweeted his response to it			0
' i read this and ... " naw i 'm @entity67 " ' @entity68 is watching you : the app needed to access a pre-release of @entity7 's new album demands access to a lot of personal information one of the features advertised around the release was that users would be able to read the lyrics to the new songs on the app. it 's a little more complex than that			1
users must unlock lyrics by posting on @entity51 or @entity52			0
the formatted post is ' i just unlocked a new lyric ' @entity87 ' in the @entity7 @entity32 app. see them first			0
@entity91 # @entity92 ' you could change the wording but you had to post or no lyrics			0
and it is n't a one - time thing			0
you have to post every time you want to see lyrics for a song			0
' frankly , a lyric that is going to show up almost immediately on the internet is n't much of a bribe for spamming your friends , ' @entity14 wrote			0
@entity14 finds this broad - access to personal information inconsistent with @entity7 's brand , as the rapper has written lyrics for years expressing paranoia about the authorities song spam : the app which allowed certain @entity20 users to download the new @entity7 albums days before the actual release demanded social media logins and users had to post on @entity52 or @entity51 to view song lyrics ' if @entity7 wants to know about my phone calls and e-mail accounts , why does n't he join the @entity121 , ' @entity14 questioned			1
but the privacy setting were n't the only failures in the app yesterday			0
@entity14 said it took more than an hour for the download to become available to him			0
' @entity7 's sponsors at @entity20 proved themselves not only intrusive , but technically inept , ' he wrote .			2

one million @entity20 users got the chance to download ' @entity18 ' days before the actual release
the app demanded personal information such as social media logins , storage space , and *gps* location
