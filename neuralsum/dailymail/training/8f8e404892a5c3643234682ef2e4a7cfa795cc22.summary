the @entity1 faces a ‘ financial crisis ’ after next year ’s general election , a leading think - tank has warned			1
the @entity4 said a budget freeze implemented as a result of the recession risked putting the majority of hospitals into deficit			1
it warned that whoever won next may ’s election will need to find more funding for the @entity1 or face having to make ‘ significant cuts to services ’			1
the health policy think - tank reported that two - thirds of @entity1 finance directors feared their hospital would go into deficit between 2015 and 2016 , with another one in five uncertain about the future			1
' at risk ' : the majority of hospitals are at risk of going into deficit as a result of budget freezes the warning comes amid criticism from @entity30 that cuts to the @entity1 could risk patient safety in overstretched hospitals			1
@entity30 surveyed almost 3,000 nurses from across the @entity34 , and found that 65 per cent of staff said they did n’t have enough time with patients – with 55 per cent reporting that care was ‘ left undone ’ as a result			1
the union also found that 45 per cent of staff had to look after eight or more patients at once during their shift			0
that compares to 5.2 in @entity45 and 6.9 in @entity46			0
the figure in @entity34 rose to more than 50 per cent for night duty			0
it is claimed that looking after more than eight patients is considered unsafe – although there are no legal ratios in force			0
the report , published at @entity30 ’s health conference in @entity55 yesterday , found that half of nurses have to work through their breaks on night shifts or stay late to complete their work			2
it also found that three out of five nurses said they were concerned that fewer staff had led to poor care			0
concerns : @entity30 warns that @entity1 cuts could put patient safety at risk in overstretched hospitals @entity71 , @entity30 ’s head of nursing , said it was a ‘ myth ’ that night shifts were quiet – but that many organisations denied that and reduced the number of nurses			1
she said : ‘ nights are busy and often more stressful as less senior staff are around to call on for support or guidance			0
‘ some patients need pain medication , some are distressed in an unfamiliar environment , sometimes patients can not sleep and need someone to hold their hand			0
the government needs to face up to the damage it is inflicting on patients and staff by not introducing legally enforceable nurse to patient ratios , and take urgent action			2
’ chancellor @entity98 has consistently protected the @entity99 from budget cuts			2
but because of rising costs due to @entity34 ’s ageing population , the need for new technology , and the rising cost of medicine , the @entity1 in @entity101 has in effect had no real rise in spending since 2010 and there are already 65 trusts in deficit			1
the @entity99 ’s budget will rise by only 0.1 per cent in 2014 - 15			2
@entity115 , the @entity4 ’s director of policy and former economic adviser at the @entity117 , said the @entity118 and @entity119 faced a ‘ big political choice ’			0
he told @entity121 : ‘ in the past each time the @entity1 has got very close to the wire , governments have found extra money			2
’ he added : ‘ the health service now is a very large proportion of overall spending because it ’s been protected while other areas of public spending have been cut back			0
‘ i do n’t think any of the political parties are ready for this			0
it ’s a difficult one with deficit reduction so important and the @entity1 so important – they are stuck between a rock and a hard place			1
