by @entity0 a mother of seven has been found dead in a jail cell halfway through a 48 - hour sentence she was serving for her children 's absence from school			1
@entity6 , 55 , was found dead at @entity7 in @entity8 , during a two day sentence that would have erased about $ 2000 in fines and court costs			1
the debt had accumulated since 1999 , and involved several of her seven children , most recently her boys at high school			1
district judge @entity31 , who reluctantly sent her to prison after she failed to pay the debt for four years , described her as a ' lost soul '			2
' did something happen ? was she scared to death ? this lady did n't need to be there			2
' police said the cause of her death was not yet known but it was not suspicious			0
@entity6 's court file showed a laundry list of court fees for one case alone : $ 8 for a ' judicial computer project ' ; $ 60 for @entity7 constables ; $ 10 for postage			1
judge @entity31 said he had lost sleep over her death but also acknowledged a short jail stint can sometimes ' break the habit ' of parents who 'd rather party into the night than take their children to school the next day			1
he said @entity6 did not work or appear to have much help with four children still at home			2
she frequently skipped hearings , or arrived without requested documents			0
' she cared about her kids , but her kids ruled the roost			0
she was just accepting what was coming , and ( would ) let the cards fall where they may			0
' although she was often unkempt , she came to court clean and neat to surrender the day before her death			0
she had on clean sweatpants , had combed her hair , and had tape holding her glasses together .			0
