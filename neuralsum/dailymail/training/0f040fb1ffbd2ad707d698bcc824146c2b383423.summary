@entity1 is investigating its supply chain after the discovery of a disturbing cluster of leukaemia deaths among young workers at a factory in @entity8 where millions of its iphones are made , @entity0 has learnt			1
at least 13 workers in their late teens and early 20s have been diagnosed with leukaemia after falling sick at the massive factory in @entity16 since 2010			1
five have died – and at ages when doctors say cases of the blood cancer are rare			1
families and a labour welfare group believe the leukaemia was caused by exposure to chemicals used to clean electrical panels and say many more workers could have been affected			1
they add that young workers who fall sick with leukaemia are dismissed and denied continuing medical coverage , bankrupting families as they desperately pay for treatment			1
the factory is used for manufacturing by other electronics giants but has been the main production base for @entity1 ’s iphones since the first model in 2007			2
details of the leukaemia cluster emerged after @entity1 last month announced it was banning the use of two potentially toxic chemicals , benzene and n - hexane , in the final assembly of iphones and @entity67			1
@entity37 , owner of the @entity16 factory , is sending officials to meet the @entity72 - based labour welfare group to find out more about the leukaemia cases , the labour group said			1
however , the @entity75 - based company , which also makes products for other electronics giants , insisted there was no evidence to link the leukaemia cases to the victims ’ work and said it had not used benzene and n - hexane ‘ for many years ’			1
it also claimed the rate of leukaemia at its plants across @entity8 was ‘ significantly lower than the reported annual rate ’			1
@entity88 affects about three people in 100,000 globally , but the majority of its victims are children and elderly people			2
all 13 identified victims were aged between 19 and 24 when their cancer was diagnosed and were working on or near production lines mostly for iphones and @entity1 products at the @entity102 and @entity103 plants at @entity37 in @entity16 , @entity95 said			1
families of the victims said workers regularly used chemicals with only disposable plastic gloves and face masks for protection , were given little or no information about the potential dangers , and were not told which substances they were handling			1
after falling sick at work and being diagnosed with leukaemia , the families of two workers said they were dismissed and paid off by @entity37 within three months , denying them medical cover to pay for hospital treatment			1
the leukaemia cluster emerged when families visiting sick relatives in the cancer ward of the @entity124 in @entity16 noticed how many other @entity37 workers were being treated			1
@entity126 , whose son @entity127 is now in the advanced stages of leukaemia , said seven to eight workers a year from the same factory were diagnosed and admitted			1
@entity127 , now 26 , from a village in @entity8 ’s @entity134 province , was 22 when he began at @entity37 in march 2010 , on a basic salary of £ 150 a month			1
speaking at her son ’s hospital bedside , ms @entity126 said : ‘ for the first month , he was cleaning all the machines with chemicals			1
he never knew what chemicals he was handling because they were given to him by the distributor up the line			2
he said he was just given a bucket of liquid to clean the machines			0
' after that , he changed jobs every month or two within the factory but he was on a production line when he fell ill. he started non-stop bleeding from his gums so co-workers helped him go to hospital			2
’ he was diagnosed with leukaemia			2
‘ i was shocked , ’ said ms @entity126 , who has given up work to care for her son , sleeping on a mattress on the floor of his ward			0
‘ i had never even heard of that disease in my home town			0
i thought , “ how could this happen ? ” ’ a doctor treating @entity127 told ms @entity126 that chemicals at @entity37 might be to blame			2
‘ he told me @entity37 has a high incidence of this disease , ’ she said , adding that the doctor had rounded angrily on @entity37 managers when they visited			0
‘ the doctor told them , “ you know why this is happening			0
even your boss [ @entity37 ’s billionaire founder ] @entity177 ’s brother died of leukaemia			2
you have so many patients in our hospital already			0
do you really need to ask how he is ? ” ’ @entity127 began a course of chemotherapy			0
factory bosses told him he would have his wages paid to april and would then be dismissed			2
fellow workers collected about £ 6,000 towards @entity127 ’s medical bills , while @entity37 paid him £ 3,000 for his termination , equivalent to a year ’s wages with overtime			0
by august 2012 , @entity127 ’s family could no longer afford his medical bills			0
‘ we asked for help from the factory but they said , “ it ’s not our fault , it ’s your disease , ” ’ ms @entity126 said			2
by then , she had discovered there were many other workers from @entity37 being treated for leukaemia at the same hospital			2
‘ there were seven or eight people from @entity37 who got leukaemia that year alone , ’ she said			0
a group of them protested outside the factory gates , demanding to see management , but were threatened with arrest unless they left			0
when their money ran out , @entity127 ’s mother took him home to @entity134 where they tried treating him with @entity8 traditional medicine			2
he returned to @entity16 in august last year as his condition worsened			2
‘ the doctors say he needs a bone - marrow transplant and they have found a donor but we have no money for the transplant , ’ his mother said			0
the identity card belonged to @entity228 , who died of leukaemia last year aged just 20			1
he had been working at @entity37 ’s @entity16 plant for four months when he began to suffer heavy nose bleeds celebrating : @entity1 ceo @entity232 with @entity46 at the @entity44 launch last week another worker , @entity228 , had been working at the factory for only four months when he was taken to hospital after suffering heavy nose bleeds in june 2011			1
he was diagnosed with leukaemia and died in november 2013 , aged 20			1
his parents @entity239 and @entity241 , both 50 , rented out their farm in @entity243 , north - west @entity8 , and now work as street - cleaners in @entity16 to try to pay off £ 80,000 of debt from paying for his treatment			1
@entity228 worked in the inventory of the factory , handing out materials and chemicals to workers			1
he wore disposable gloves and a face mask but was told by his bosses the chemicals were safe , his father said			0
‘ i talked to other patients and families in hospital and i found many of the patients had worked in @entity37 – a dozen or more , ’ mr @entity228 said			1
a delegation of factory managers came to see @entity228 in hospital			1
‘ first they came to see how he was doing			0
then they brought him 21,000 renminbi [ £ 2,100 ] and said , “ this is a donation from the factory towards your illness			0
” they never came again and that was all he got			0
‘ three months after he fell ill , they stopped paying him his wages , including his social insurance			0
’ mr @entity228 went to the local government in @entity16 to seek a ruling that his son ’s death was the result of industrial disease , but he received a written reply saying @entity37 was a clean working environment that satisfied government requirements on chemical safety			1
@entity290 , executive director of @entity95 , said she believed the 13 known cases in @entity16 were ‘ the tip of the iceberg ’ and that many more @entity37 workers had succumbed to the disease			2
in most cases , workers had returned to their home provinces where they were entitled to free medical help after being dismissed , despite the fact that many rural hospitals lack facilities to treat them			0
the factory , in @entity16 , @entity8 , is used for manufacturing by other electronics giants but has been the main production base for @entity1 ’s iphones since the first model in 2007 in an email to @entity95 about the leukaemia cases , @entity1 ’s senior director for supplier responsibility , @entity313 , said @entity1 took the concerns ‘ very seriously ’ , adding : ‘ we are working closely with @entity37 on this matter			1
’ before announcing its ban on benzene and n - hexane last month , @entity1 said it had conducted a four - month investigation into 22 factories and said it found no evidence that the chemicals endangered the 500,000 people working there			0
an @entity1 spokesman said in a statement it had discovered ‘ a few cases ’ in which suppliers were using benzene or n - hexane before it banned the two chemicals from its final assembly lines			0
however , the statement said use of the two chemicals ‘ was in low concentrations and each use complied with our @entity336 ’			0
a spokesman for @entity37 said he could not comment on individual former employees but added in a statement : ‘ the incidence of leukaemia among the over one million employees in our campuses across @entity8 is significantly lower than the reported national annual rate of incidence of leukaemia			1
‘ we can also confirm that the employees who were diagnosed with leukaemia held different positions and job functions while working at our company across different product lines and customers , as the majority of our campuses in @entity8 serve multiple customers and manufacture a variety of products – there is no commonality , including links with any chemical agents , associated with the work they were doing			1
‘ @entity37 does not allow any entity within our company to use benzene or n - hexane , and has not procured or used these chemicals in any aspect of our operations for many years			0
’ ms @entity126 told @entity0 she had a message for @entity1 ceo @entity232			0
‘ if you have a conscience , @entity1 should at least make sure my son ’s disease is treated			0
i do n’t want compensation			0
i just want his medical bills to be covered so that his disease can be treated to give him a chance to live , ’ she said			0
‘ i know that without a bone - marrow transplant my son will probably die			0
but we do n’t have the money to pay for it			0

five staff at @entity44 factory in @entity16 , @entity8 have died from leukaemia
cancer may have been caused by cleaning chemicals , victims ' families say
one worker had only been at factory four months before he was diagnosed
@entity228 , 20 , suffered heavy *nosebleeds* in factory and has since died
