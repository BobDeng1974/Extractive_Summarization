he started out modestly enough — by just wanting a different nose			1
in the end , after up to 100 procedures , he was desperately trying to repair the damage done by reckless and botched operations and injections			1
@entity8 , surely the most infamous example of the perils of cosmetic surgery , spent 30 years trying to achieve his idea of perfection			1
some friends said he was modelling himself on @entity15 , others that he just wanted to obliterate all resemblance to his hated father			0
1977 , left : only 19 , @entity8 is the star of the @entity19 and about to launch himself as a solo performer			1
despite this success , he loathes his appearance , as he recalled years later : ‘ i had pimples so badly it used to make me so shy			2
’ indeed , the misery is written all over his face			0
according to @entity27 , @entity8 was especially distressed by his nose and would say : ‘ it ’s too big , i want to get it done			1
’ 1979 , right : an apparently confident 20 - year - old @entity8 shows off his new nose			1
ashamed to admit he just wanted a smaller nose , he claimed he ’d had an operation after breaking it during a dance rehearsal			2

his nose seems to have been thinned again and cheek implants have been inserted			1

1991 , right : now 33 and living a reclusive life			0
after a fourth or fifth nose job , his nostrils have started to assume a triangular look			1
( in 1992 he was spotted wearing a prosthetic nose tip to try to cover up the botched results of the surgery			1
) he has a new dimple in his chin and has had chin implants to make it larger			2
he has started to look whiter — he later claimed this was a consequence of the skin condition vitiligo a new tv documentary about his surgery addiction reveals he was so nervous about the initial rhinoplasty ( nose job ) that he persuaded his older sister @entity27 to act as a guinea pig			1
miss @entity76 , 58 , said : ‘ he wanted to get his nose done			2
he kept saying : “ what do you think ? what do you think ? ” i said : “ @entity8 , if that ’s what you want , if it ’s gon na make you feel better , get it done			1
” ‘ he asked me : “ can you be the guinea pig for me ? can you get your nose done and let me see how it looks , and if it hurts ? ” ’ once satisfied with the results of @entity27 ’s operation , @entity8 went ahead with it himself in 1979			1

’ by now @entity8 was married to @entity102 ’s daughter @entity101			2
they separated the following year			0
2002 , right : he has taped his nose , apparently to stop fluid from botched surgery from leaking into his mouth			2
he wore the tape at all times during this period			0
leading rhinoplasty surgeon dr @entity112 said : ‘ i think something in his nose , a graft , an implant , has now come out through the skin and that ’s why he ’s probably got a hole in his skin			2
he has what we call an end - stage nose , one that ’s beyond the @entity128 ’ 2003 , left : looking more feminine shortly after the birth of his third child , @entity130			0
in a controversial documentary made by @entity132 , he claimed : ‘ i ’ve had no plastic surgery on my face , just my nose			2
it helped me breathe better so i can hit higher notes			0
i am telling you the honest truth , i did n’t do anything to my face			0
’ he also said he ’d be happier on stage ‘ wearing a mask ’			0
2009 , right : @entity8 , 50 , was in debt to the tune of £ 350 million			2
he announced a surprise tour called @entity146			0
his friend dr @entity147 said : ‘ it got to the point where his nose was far too thin			0
it did n’t look natural to me			0
i rebuilt it using fillers			0
’ he is missing part of his ear — the cartilage having been used to rebuild his face			0
he died of a cardiac arrest in june before the tour after being given drugs to help him sleep a computer - generated image of how @entity8 would have looked today without surgery seven years later , he also persuaded a friend and fellow plastic surgery devotee , @entity166 hair stylist @entity165 , to be the first to experiment with a cleft chin operation			1
@entity165 claims @entity8 ’s plastic surgeon told the singer that he needed a chin ‘ like @entity171 , something very masculine ’			2
after @entity165 ’s new chin was revealed , @entity8 went on to have this operation several times			1
despite his initial nerves , @entity8 also had @entity176 , fillers , bleached his skin , had cheek implants and lip augmentation			1
he changed the shape of his nose to the point that it was so narrow the airways were blocked			0
body dysmorphic disorder expert dr @entity185 — who believes @entity8 was suffering from the illness , where sufferers have a distorted view of their appearance — has claimed he had as many as 100 procedures			1
eventually his original features were almost completely obliterated , as was his ethnicity			0
but the documentary ’s most heartbreaking revelation is a computer - generated image of how the star could have looked had he left his face alone — an attractive , contented black man with a warm smile			0
the nose : @entity8 begged his sister @entity27 to have a nose job first — so he could ‘ see how it looks ’ and find out ‘ if it hurts ’ ( pictured ) the chin : the guinea pig for the more masculine ‘ @entity171 ’ cleft chin was friend and hair stylist @entity165 ( pictured )			1
