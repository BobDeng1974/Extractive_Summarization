' they have very high security fences so i have no idea how they have got in there			0
the body was found in a doorway by a side entrance into the school			1

' another neighbour added : ' it 's terrible to hear what has happened			0
' there is quite a big estate here behind the school but no - one is near the front so we do n't know what happened			2
