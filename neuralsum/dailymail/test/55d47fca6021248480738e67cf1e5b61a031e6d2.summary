hundreds of explorers , theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous ' big - foot '			2
but a leading geneticist believes he has found evidence to prove that it - or rather she - could have been more than a myth			2
professor @entity9 of the @entity10 claims a towering woman named @entity12 who lived in 19th century @entity13 - and appeared to be ' half human , half ape ' - could have been the fabled yeti			1
witnesses described the six - foot , six - inches tall woman discovered in the @entity19 between @entity20 and @entity13 as having ' all the characteristics of a wild animal ' - and covered in thick auburn hair			1
she was captured by a local merchant in the 1850s who hired a group of hunters to subdue and shackle her in the mountainous terrain			2
professor @entity9 claims @entity12 was kept in a ' ditch surrounded by sharpened spikes ' and sold from owner to owner until she came to serve nobleman @entity85 as a servant			1
famously known as the ape woman , @entity12 had at least four children by local men and some of her descendants still live in the region , the @entity87 reported			1
@entity9 made an astonishing discovery when he carried out saliva tests on six of her living relatives and the tooth of her deceased son @entity38			1
the dna analysis revealed that they all contained the right amount of @entity40 dna for @entity12 the ape woman to be ' 100 per cent @entity40 ' but remarkably she did not resemble any known group			1
discovery : professor @entity9 of the @entity10 analysed the dna of her living relatives in the @entity108 region and found west - @entity40 genes myth ? the first accounts of the @entity112 emerged before the 19th century from @entity113 who believed that the creature inhabited the @entity116 her resemblance was that of a wild beast - ' the most frightening feature of which was her expression which was pure animal , ' one @entity13 zoologist wrote in 1996			1
the man who organised various eyewitness accounts of @entity12 wrote : ' her athletic power was enormous			1
evidence : in his book ' @entity128 ' , @entity9 argues that @entity12 could be the yeti she would outrun a horse and swim across the @entity131 even when it rose in violent high tide			1
' some have argued that she was a runaway @entity135 slave but professor @entity9 says her ' unparalleled dna ' refutes that theory			1
he believes her ancestors came out of @entity40 over 100,000 years ago and lived in the remote @entity140 for many generations			2
@entity12 was eventually ' tamed ' by the nobleman who bought her as a servant and kept her on his estate in @entity51 in the @entity73			1
accounts from the time claim she was incredibly muscular , slept outdoors and ran around naked until she died on the estate in 1890			2
some of his colleagues doubt his other findings - which include a claim that an unknown species of bear might account for yeti sightings in @entity156			0
despite the lack of hard proof from the analysis of the alleged ' yeti hairs ' , he says he has developed a strong sense that ' something is out there ' after speaking to dozens of witnesses			1
professor @entity9 could not say if the yeti , bigfoot or the @entity13 almasty is the best candidate for a surviving race of human ' apemen '			2
he said : ' @entity170 has many more people trying to find it			0
but i suppose either the yeti or the alma / almasty , which live in inaccessible and very thinly populated regions , is the most likely			0
' the first accounts of @entity112 emerged before the 19th century from @entity113 who believed that the creature inhabited the @entity116			0
they depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound			0
in 1832 , an explorer who had his account of trekking in @entity191 published in the @entity192 spoke of seeing tall , bipedal creature covered with long dark hair , which seemed to flee in fear			1
the term @entity112 was developed in 1921 following a book by lieutenant - colonel @entity198 called @entity199			0

mystical : hundreds of explorers , theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous ' big - foot ' the @entity214 led a trip called the the @entity216 in 1954 to @entity217			0
during the trip mountaineering leader @entity218 photographed ancient paintings of yetis and large footprints in the snow			0

@entity229 mountaineer @entity228 claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling @entity231 in 1970			0
he said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a @entity112 's call			0
that night , he saw a dark shape moving near his camp			0
in recent times , there have been more reported @entity112 sightings and at a conference in @entity13 in 2011 , scientists declared they were 95 per cent certain of the existence of @entity112			0
in 2013 , a scientist claimed that the @entity112 was a distant relative of the polar bear , which is thought to have died out more than 40,000 years ago			0
