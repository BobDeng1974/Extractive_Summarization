by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 21:07 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 21:07 est , 21 february 2013 @entity1 provoked outrage after he said older people should retrain so they can keep working a minister has been condemned for suggesting that the over- 60s should go to university and retrain so they can keep working			1
@entity1 , the higher education minister , said older workers should keep their skills up to date by taking out loans to fund degrees			1
‘ education is such a good thing it is not reserved for younger people , ’ he said			2
‘ there will be people of all ages who will want to study			2
there is great value in lifelong learning			0
’ he added that there was now nothing to stop older people from applying for university as the ‘ ageist ’ limits on student loans for the over- 55s had been lifted			1
the government wants older people to stop simply studying for leisure and start taking vocational courses			1
but pensioner groups say the plan would put unfair pressure on people to run up huge debts to fund potentially futile degrees			0
@entity35 , a former government pensions adviser , said : ‘ the average private pension pot is just under £ 30,000 in total , the same amount as a three - year degree			0
‘ for an older person who may never go on to earn more than £ 21,000 [ the threshold before you start paying back student loans ] , it is a huge investment			2
‘ many of them will never end up paying off their loans			0
why should society be paying for them ? ’ dr @entity35 said older workers would be better off doing shorter courses , many of which could be provided by employers			1
critics fear that graduates already struggling to find work will have to compete with older people for scarce jobs			2
@entity59 of the @entity60 said : ‘ at a time of rising youth unemployment , it seems counterproductive that they should be competing with the over- 60s for scarce jobs			1
‘ does @entity1 really think someone in their 60s will spend three years racking up £ 30,000 in debt when there are no guarantees the degree will lead to a job ? the government wants older people to stop studying for leisure and start taking vocational courses ‘ older workers face invisible barriers of age discrimination in the workplace and studying for a degree will do nothing to resolve that			1
’ but mr @entity1 said : ‘ there is certainly a pressure for continuing to get retrained and upskilled			1
‘ higher education has an economic benefit in that if you stay up to date with knowledge and skills you are more employable			1
’ ‘ the idea that you first study and then stop is n’t what the world is like any more			0
’ of the 552,240 undergraduates in @entity96 last year , 1,940 were over 60 – only 0.35 per cent			0
last year , @entity99 mandarin @entity97 suggested that the elderly should ‘ earn ’ their pensions by doing voluntary work in exchange for the payment			0
the former head of the @entity106 triggered fury when he suggested a series of rewards and fines should be used to make sure the elderly made a ‘ useful contribution to civil society ’			0
a quarter of @entity96 will be aged over 65 by 2033			0
to reflect this , the state pension age will rise to 67 in 2028 .			0
