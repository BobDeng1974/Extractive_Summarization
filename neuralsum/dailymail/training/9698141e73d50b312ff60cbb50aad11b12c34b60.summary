perhaps it explained his restless manner on the touchline			0
@entity4 is not at ease when his defence springs a leak			1
it does n't happen often , but it disturbs him when it does			0
it happened at @entity9 and again at home to @entity11			2
add to this , the nerves of an intense tie between two clubs who have grown to share an intense dislike of each other over the last decade			0
this was snarling @entity4 on full power , disputing every decision , picking fights , pressurising officials			2
he was deep into another complaint to fourth official @entity25 when @entity26 scored in the fourth minute of extra-time			0
@entity28 boss @entity4 ( second left ) was more restless than usual on the sideline at @entity30 @entity4 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity33 manager @entity32 during the match @entity4 will be worried about the defensive issues that have began to sneak into his side 's performances he missed the goal			1
but here was a show for his team , a sign that they would have to scrap and fight for this one			0
this would not be about making friends with attractive exhibition football			0
@entity48 did not need telling twice			0
after starting 30 games for @entity28 this season , @entity49 watched from a seat behind the manic figure of his manager			1
this attitude underpinned five major trophies during @entity4 's first spell at @entity30 and he turned it up in pursuit of the first silverware of his second spell			1
having conceded 20 goals in the first five months of the season – including three in a quite bizarre win at @entity64 back in august – @entity28 let in 10 in the first six games of 2015			1
there were five at @entity9 , four against @entity11 and there might have been more than one at @entity69 last week			2
@entity49 was there for them all ; something of a common denominator , you might say			2
and last night he paid the price			0
after starting 30 games for @entity28 this season , @entity49 was dropped for @entity78 ( left ) @entity4 brought in @entity79 to counter the pace and mobility of @entity33 forward @entity82 ( left ) having been one of the successes of @entity4 's first season back at @entity86 , he was axed as the manager tried to add pace and mobility to his back - four , a specific reaction to @entity82 at centre - forward			1
@entity92 ahead of @entity93 was a similar concession to @entity33 's style and strengths			1
defensive solidity has always been a trademark of @entity4 's @entity28 teams , but there have been tiny cracks appearing			1
last week at @entity69 , @entity82 unsettled his team ; too quick and mobile for @entity49 on the equaliser			2
there were other situations , too , which might have led to goals			0
@entity28 escaped with the tie level but one of @entity4 knew he has always been a coach with the ability to notice a problem and react			1
it may only be a temporary issue at this point but it will reverberate within the @entity116 camp , where the @entity28 centre - half has been earmarked as one of @entity120 's on - field leaders , and vice-captain			1
moreover , there is not a great wealth of alternatives			0
@entity92 ( right ) was also promoted ahead of @entity93 by @entity4 to nullify @entity33 's pace @entity120 will watch with interest to see if this is the start of @entity78 easing past @entity49 in the pecking order at @entity30			1
or perhaps a sign that the @entity28 boss will target a long - term central defensive upgrade in the transfer market			1
@entity78 certainly did not give the impression of a finished article on only his tenth start for the club he joined in the summer			0
he signed a year ago from @entity137 but completed the season in @entity139			2
at the age of 20 , this was a big test of temperament as much as ability			0
@entity144 gave him an extra-long pre-kick - off man - hug and a word of advice			0
@entity78 has all the physical requirements to be a successful centre - half in @entity116			0
he is enormous , brave and quick across the ground , cutting a figure like a young @entity153			0
but there was an early error of judgment on half - way , when he was drawn under a high ball and released @entity82 with a glancing header			0
he had the pace to recover as @entity82 skipped past @entity144 on the edge of the penalty box			0
@entity163 unzipped the @entity28 back - four with pass between @entity78 , on the right of the centre - halves , and the right - back , which was @entity168 at the time , since @entity26 was elsewhere , still deciding how to divide his attention between wing - back @entity170 and the more advanced threat of @entity173			1
@entity4 missed @entity26 's goal in extra-time becuase he was complaining to fourth official @entity25 @entity26 was erratic in the first - half although he would ultimately make amends with his goal			1
@entity179 was not at his best and @entity4 was upset by the reluctance of his central midfielders to pass the ball forward , quickly on the turnover of possession , and turned his despair to his staff as they often opted to play towards their own goal			2
injuries to @entity191 and @entity192 will worry him but the way @entity33 's attacking players troubled @entity28 will also eat away at @entity4 with @entity195 here on saturday and @entity197 waiting in the @entity198			1
he will enjoy the clean sheet , but it will not fool him			0
@entity200 saved well from @entity170 who collected the splendid @entity163 pass , as he did when @entity173 glided past @entity78 , on the half - hour			0
there were still big holes in the @entity28 defensive unit			2
more clinical finishing by @entity33 and they would have been behind at the break			2
there may be issues in @entity28 's defence at present , but @entity200 remains a rock in goal @entity200 was quite immense throughout , and his early saves bought @entity4 time to adjust and stabilise the team			1
the home team were stronger in the second half , more successful at breaking up @entity33 's rhythm in the midfield and cutting the supply to the fluent forwards			1
they were helped by the general mood of dissent which simmered on the pitch and off it , where the @entity28 boss picked a fight with @entity32 ' sidekick @entity228 and @entity48 with whoever he was nearest to			2
@entity28 were not watertight but they protected their clean - sheet with great spirit - and they are going to @entity232 with a goal from a defender .			1

@entity49 was dropped by @entity4 for the clash with @entity33
@entity92 was also chosen ahead of @entity93
@entity49 struggled during @entity28 's shock 4 - 2 loss to @entity11
@entity28 conceded 20 goals in the first five months of the season
but the @entity245 have leaked 10 in six games since the turn of the year
