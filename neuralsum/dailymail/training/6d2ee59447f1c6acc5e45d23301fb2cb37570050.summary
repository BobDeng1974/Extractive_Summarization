two care home workers have been arrested on suspicion of ill - treatment and neglect following the ‘ unexplained ’ death of an elderly resident – the second in days			1
a 43 - year - old man and a girl of 19 were quizzed by detectives over the death of a 93 - year - old woman at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , on february 8			1
it came days after an 86 - year - old woman died at the home on january 31			1
police arrested two care home workers after 83 - year - old and 93 - year - old residents died within days of each other police said they are not linking them , but because the two women died within days of each other they have launched a joint investigation with health and safety , health watchdogs and council officials			1
the staff members were arrested and questioned on suspicion of neglect under the @entity33 and were released on bail until march 8			1
a spokesman for @entity36 said no other arrests had been made but the investigation was ongoing			2
emergency measures have been put in place to make sure there are no risks to other residents at the home , which was criticised in a report by watchdogs two years ago			0
detective sergeant @entity47 , from @entity49 ’s protecting vulnerable persons unit , said : ‘ the deaths are being treated as unexplained at this time and it is important to stress that although they both involve residents of @entity10 , we are not currently linking them			2
’ both women died in hospital , it is understood			1
the home , run by @entity60 , has 76 single rooms and two double rooms in a converted domestic home and two extensions			0
it provides 24 - hour care for the elderly and has a self - contained dementia care unit with 20 beds			2
a 43 - year - old man from @entity71 , west @entity72 and a 19 - year - old woman from @entity11 , were questioned and released on bail last month an elderly resident was taken to hospital after part of the ceiling collapsed , causing a piece of plaster to hit her on the head			1
in 2013 , the @entity82 launched an unannounced inspection after concerns were raised and ordered the home to improve			2
it found @entity87 was failing in areas including staff training and record keeping and found residents were at risk of malnutrition and dehydration			2
a report said staff had not been trained how to help those with swallowing difficulties – a common symptom of dementia – or on how to reduce the risks of choking			0
‘ this meant people were not protected from the risks of inadequate nutrition and / or dehydration , ’ the report said			0
inspectors also found that many staff had not received food hygiene training			0
@entity36 , @entity109 , the @entity110 and the health regulator , @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , began a joint inquiry after the deaths , but police say the deaths are not being linked a follow - up inspection the same year found the home was meeting all five of the regulator ’s safety standards following a number of changes			1
relatives yesterday told of their shock at the arrests			0
@entity126 , 85 , from @entity11 , whose 82 - year - old wife is a resident at the home , said he was spoken to by police and asked if anything ‘ weird ’ was happening there			1
he said frail and elderly residents were often left to wander around the building alone but said that , overall , his wife was happy			0
the @entity82 said it was working closely with other organisations in response to the ‘ tragic ’ incidents and warned further action would be taken to protect residents if needed			0
@entity140 , the watchdog ’s deputy chief inspector in the @entity142 , said : ‘ measures have been put in place to ensure there are no further risks and we will continue to monitor the situation and if necessary take action to protect the safety and well - being of those living at the home			0
