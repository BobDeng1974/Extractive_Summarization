on a scrap of paper at @entity3 last march , @entity0 scribbled down the one word lacking from his @entity6 team after they had been beaten by @entity7			1
at @entity9 , @entity0 ’s side showed ‘ balls ’ of steel , surviving a difficult game against one of those teams — and at one of those grounds — where anything can happen			1
@entity6 have the mentality of champions			1
their celebrations at @entity21 on sunday told a story , linking arms and sliding to their knees in front of their supporters after they had beaten @entity28 2 - 0 in the @entity30 final			2
@entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 leave the @entity9 pitch after another victory for @entity6 @entity0 won the first trophy of his second stint at @entity6 and few would bet against him adding the title @entity6 celebrate their @entity30 trophy win at @entity21 and maintained their five - point lead there have been markers at key stages of the season : a 2 - 0 win over @entity46 in october , 2 - 1 at @entity47 the following month and their stunning performance in the 5 - 0 win at @entity50 in january			1
this 1 - 0 victory at @entity52 was another			2
@entity6 ’s bond is strong , building this resilience in the dressing room as the season has progressed			1
they looked impenetrable , especially in the closing stages as @entity52 pushed for an equaliser			1
their work - rate is phenomenal , a team fighting for each other as they close in on their first @entity63 title since @entity0 returned to the club			1
he described himself as a kid after he ambushed the trophy celebrations on sunday , but it is on nights like this when the big boys go to work			2
look around the @entity6 dressing room and it will be difficult to separate some of these players when it comes to voting for the @entity76 in a few weeks ’ time			1
@entity32 , exceptional against @entity28 at @entity21 , must be in with a shout			0
incredible as it sounds , he last won it in 2005			0
@entity84 , returning in goal in place of @entity83 , was exceptional			0
his first - half save from @entity86 was top class			0
he oozes confidence , taking responsibility as the last line of defence after @entity32 ’s early booking for a foul on @entity94			0
the doubts that crept in after a rare mistake in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity98 in january have been eradicated			0
@entity0 has made the right call to make him first choice			2
@entity84 was again exceptional and could make it back - to - back titles after winning @entity103 last year @entity104 probes into @entity52 territory with @entity106 and @entity107 close by @entity104 , what with those 15 assists in the league since his move last summer from @entity111 , will also be in the running			2
then there is last season ’s @entity115 , the tormentor - in - chief down @entity6 ’s left last night			1
he scored with a clever header from a cross by @entity33 in the 22nd minute to secure his side ’s 19th league victory of the season			0
sometimes he leaves you drooling			0
his composure on the ball , coupled with that ability to be able to run with it when he is looking at the options around him , are made to look like pure instinct			0
some of the twists and turns , creating space by leaving @entity136 and @entity137 wrong - footed , were of the highest order			0
so what has changed since last season , when they gifted @entity98 their second @entity63 title with a series of faltering performances ? they have the bottle for the big occasion now			1
at @entity21 last sunday , @entity0 turned to a television camera and squirted water all over the lens after @entity32 had opened the scoring for @entity6			1
here they washed @entity52 ’s faces again			0
@entity154 dives in vain as @entity157 's header sails past the @entity159 keeper and into the back of @entity52 's net hazard was in irresistible form and leads @entity137 a merry dance here for many different reasons , some tribal and some because of an irrational hatred of former player @entity166 , who has since left @entity167 , away at @entity52 is always a tough fixture for @entity6			1
to their credit they always seem to survive the taunts , the songs from the terraces that are usually directed at the captain @entity32 and his mother			0
@entity6 ’s captain always appears unmoved by it all			2
but there was more last night			0
when @entity179 was fouled by @entity137 just before half - time , @entity52 ’s supporters sang ‘ you wo n’t let him on the train ’ when he was waiting for treatment			0
naturally those chants , given the dreadful incident on the @entity187 before @entity6 ’s @entity189 clash at @entity190 last month , should be discouraged			2
@entity6 are the big noise in football right now , the team to beat as they prepare to face @entity194 in the return leg of their last - 16 @entity189 tie next week			1
increasingly @entity6 look like a team determined to power on and finish the job in the @entity63 after feeding off the scraps last season			1
after this , the message from @entity0 was loud and clear			2
@entity52 players gather around the floored @entity179 after @entity137 ' tackle on the @entity205			0

@entity6 have discovered the *ruthless* , *killer* instinct required to win matches
the bond is already strong , building this resilience in the dressing room as the season has progressed . here at @entity9 they looked impenetrable
their work - rate is phenomenal . they are a team fighting for each other as they close in on their first @entity63 title since @entity0 's return
increasingly they look like a team determined to power on and finish the job well before they play their final game of the season against @entity230
