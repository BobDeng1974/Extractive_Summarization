there was widespread outrage among @entity3 delegates at their meeting ahead of the @entity5 when the £ 16million outlay on @entity8 ’s vanity project film was discussed			1
the @entity10 representatives were aghast that @entity8 should commit so much money — more than the annual turnover of most of @entity3 ’s national associations — to the @entity5 history film @entity15 , which was launched at the @entity16 last month			2
when @entity17 first revealed the sum @entity8 had agreed to put into the project — against staff advice — @entity21 claimed the true figure was far lower			0
under fire : @entity5 president @entity8 has been criticised by @entity3 delegates but financial director @entity24 , who rubber stamped the decision without the knowledge of a number of @entity5 executive committee members , confirmed it was £ 16m this week			1
@entity24 added that it was agreed at the 2009 @entity5 and included in @entity5 ’s 2010 financial report as a @entity34 budget entry			1
but it is understandable that representatives from @entity5 ’s main decision - making committee knew nothing about this increasingly murky affair when their independent audit overseer @entity41 acknowledged it was a ‘ single line entry ’ without a purpose being specified			2
spilling the beans : @entity5 's finance administrator has confirmed the £ 16m sum used to make the film @entity5 will have to spend upwards of £ 1million on sending blood and urine samples from @entity34 drugs tests to @entity51 after @entity53 ’s poorly - equipped laboratory had its accreditation removed			1
@entity56 president sir @entity55 will hold talks in @entity53 on saturday to make sure preparations for a new lab for the @entity60 are on course			1
@entity63 chief @entity62 has invited @entity55 to dinner , making sure it did not clash with the @entity67 game			0
@entity55 pointed out it would not be a problem as he is @entity70			0
@entity8 has easily seen off all challengers to his @entity5 presidency but @entity3 chief @entity73 is playing a canny game			0
@entity73 , whose @entity5 election contention has shifted from definitely not to maybe , is wisely keeping options open to see how far @entity8 ’s reputation is tarnished from the @entity79 scandal and the fall - out from @entity82 ’s shambolic @entity34 preparation			1
keeping his options open : @entity73 with @entity8 on wednesday meanwhile , the criticism by @entity85 , who rarely speaks in public , of @entity8 ’s ridiculous claims of racism against the @entity90 press is seen as a clear sign of him emerging as a candidate to be the next @entity3 president			0
both the @entity95 and @entity96 will have backdrops of @entity98 and @entity99 from their purpose - built @entity53 broadcasting positions			2
the @entity95 facilities are bigger and no wonder , as they have sent 272 personnel to @entity82 compared to @entity96 ’s 123			0
meanwhile , @entity105 administrator @entity104 is considering bringing home two of @entity108 ’s four crews in @entity82 after @entity5 barred non rights holders from pre-match access to @entity34 stadiums			1
delayed : @entity67 's journey from their hotel to the training base is becoming a nightmare @entity67 ’s journey from their hotel to their training base must be causing concern			1
first predicted to take 20 minutes , the eight - mile trip initially took 39 minutes , then 45 and on wednesday lasted 55 minutes , with the extra delays blamed on protests on the @entity98			0
there have been no signs of the priority lanes promised to the @entity67 , while there is no chance of a rebellious @entity53 public observing the @entity130 lanes that must be installed for the @entity131			1
a 2016 spokesman said lane details were under discussion			0
things are no better in @entity136 , where @entity5 executive committee members endured four - hour journeys from the airport and saw delegates bussed in at 7am yesterday to avoid the traffic chaos			2
perhaps they may now be looking forward to the @entity34 in @entity79 , where all stadiums are in a 75 - mile radius			0
charm offensive : @entity146 and team - mate @entity147 have met fans it may all go pear - shaped in @entity150 on friday , but the @entity67 charm offensive has continued through the week in @entity152 and up to the eve of the team travelling to the @entity156 city , with @entity67 players @entity147 and @entity146 staging a meet and greet with fans at a hotel near the team ’s @entity162 base .			0

@entity5 president *sanctions* *massive* outlay on vanity film project
drugs - testing at @entity34 to cost *authorities* another £ 1m after @entity53 lab has its accreditation removed
@entity67 's commute to training becoming a cause for concern
