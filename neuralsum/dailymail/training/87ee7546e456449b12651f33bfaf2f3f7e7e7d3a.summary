despite the cutesy scenes for which he is famous , @entity6 was also a fan of other taxidermist 's work , eventually amassing more than 10,000 pieces			2
most went into a tiny museum in that he owned in @entity43 , @entity44 , and included a multi-legged kitten , a two - headed lamb , and a bewildering assortment of other curios			0

during the @entity27 era , taxidermy - or the art of stuffing and preserving dead animals - was enormously popular			0
many , like @entity6 who made his first attempt at taxidermy as a teenager when his pet canary died , were amateur enthusiasts , although others went on to create pieces as a professional			0
whether amateur or pro , taxidermy involves skinning the subject before applying tanning or preserving chemicals to the skin			0
next , the skin is mounted on a mannequin made from wood , wire or wool before eyes made from clay or glass are added			0
although modern taxidermists generally use traditional means to preserve their animal subjects , some have embraced expensive freeze drying while others , particularly those who specialise in fish , create lifelike resin sculptures using the subject 's measurements and let the real beast swim off			2
