by @entity0 a new weight loss balloon that can be swallowed in a capsule has been launched across the @entity3			2
unlike other gastric balloon treatments , @entity4 does not require invasive surgery			1
instead , in a 10 - minute procedure , patients swallow a capsule the size of a large vitamin pill which contains a deflated balloon			1
the capsule is attached to a hollow tube and , once the capsule arrives in the stomach , the balloon is inflated to the size of an apple			0
the capsule dissolves and the tube is removed via the mouth			2
a new gastric balloon procedure has become available in the @entity3 - it sees patients swallow a capsule ( pictured ) which contains a deflated balloon and which is attached to a tube			1
once in the stomach , the tube is used to inflate the balloon			0
the tube is then removed and the capsule dissolves the balloon sits at the top of the stomach , giving patients the sensation of fullness with the hope they then eat less and lose weight			1
patients receive a second balloon 30 days after the first procedure , with the option of a third balloon after around 60 days , based on their weight loss and feelings of fullness			2
at the end of the treatment plan , a few months later , the balloons are deflated and removed during an outpatient procedure			0
patients are not able to retain the balloons for more than 90 days but the hope is that the treatment will help them make lifestyle changes which they will then be able to maintain once the balloons have been removed			2
@entity57 costs from £ 2,995 for a two - balloon treatment			0
it is currently only available privately			0
it is aimed at people who are not sufficiently overweight to qualify to weight loss surgery			1
clinical trials in the @entity3 and in the @entity64 have shown that patients lose an average of 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks			1
one patient , @entity68 , 43 , from @entity69 in @entity70 , said : ‘ history of heart disease and diabetes runs in my family , so i knew i had to take action with my weight gain to lower my risk of susceptibility , as well as improving my confidence			0
the balloon is about the size of an apple and sits at the top of the stomach to give a feeling of fullness ‘ @entity4 has proved an easy and quick treatment to help me lose weight			1
i 'm not even fully through the treatment process yet and i 've already lost a stone			0
‘ i 'm looking forward to eating more healthily , doing more exercise and ensuring my weight loss struggles are a thing of the past			0
’ @entity96 , a specialist keyhole surgeon for weight loss in the @entity98 and at @entity99 , @entity100 , said : ‘ i 've been monitoring @entity57 's progress over the last few years as i was very excited about the potential it could offer those patients who do not qualify for weight loss surgery but are struggling to lose weight and improve their health on their own			1
‘ it has minimal side effects , is quick and easy to place and is really well - tolerated			0
‘ it gives patients an initial weight - loss boost but also helps to change their eating behaviour - which is needed for long - term , weight - loss			2

@entity4 does not require invasive surgery like other weight loss procedures
it allows the patient to swallow a pill containing a deflated balloon
the pill is connected to a tube which is used to inflate the balloon once it 's in place - the tube is then removed via the mouth and the pill dissolves
the balloon sits at the top of the stomach giving a feeling of fullness
it has to be removed after a few months but it aims to help people make the lifestyle changes needed to keep the weight off
on average , patients lose 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks - and the balloon is aimed at people with @entity146 of *27* - not considered large enough for weight loss surgery
