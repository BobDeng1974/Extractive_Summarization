by @entity0 and @entity1 another bone chilling polar plunge is coming for much of the @entity4 and @entity5 by tuesday and along with painfully low temperatures will come some of the heaviest snow in years for some areas			1
millions of people from @entity10 to @entity11 can expect to get out their snow shovels and heaviest winter wardrobes tomorrow as precipitation and wind chills well below zero move from the nation 's interior out towards the @entity19 and the nation 's capital , where residents can expect what could be the most snow since an historic blizzard hit in january 2011			1
light snow was already falling monday afternoon across much of the @entity27 and down through the @entity28 , but the real headaches and potential dangers will come by evening as residents in @entity32 will experience -20f temperatures and it wo n't get much higher than the teens south to @entity35 , through the @entity5 and into @entity36 by tuesday			1
just the start : monday night 's bitter chills in the northern plains region were expected to be as low as -31 in parts of @entity32 and the weather pattern that makes such temperature possible was expected to move east over @entity36 and @entity44 a drop in temperatures is expected on tuesday night as another polar plunge hits the nation the @entity4 , @entity49 and @entity5 can expect another treacherous few days of uncomfortably low temperatures ' the cold may be intense enough to cause school closings , frozen pipes and water main breaks , ' according to @entity55 meteorologist @entity54			1
' heating systems may struggle to keep up , people will spend more money keeping their homes and businesses warm and ice will again build up on area rivers			0
' highs will generally range from the teens to lower 20s , and the cold spell could extend as far south as the @entity67 such as @entity68 , which saw the lowest temperatures of the year so far on sunday			1
the snow is expected to intensify as it moves past the @entity72 beginning tuesday and mountainous areas in the region can expect an accumulation of 6 inches or so			1
but it 's areas to the north and east that can expect to bear the brunt of the storm			2
meteorologists said on monday that snowfall in the capital had the potential to outdo the winter storm of january 2011 , when five inches fell intensifying : from @entity35 to @entity36 , residents were told monday to expect the snow already dusting the @entity4 to intensify as the fast - moving storm moved across the @entity72 in hit the moist @entity90 coast through tuesday ' even though the storm is coming during the day tuesday , @entity10 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , @entity35 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100 , @entity101 , will have enough snow to shovel and plow , ' @entity55 's @entity91 said			1
the southern extent of the precipitation can expect to see the most accumulation			0
' for @entity10 , ' said @entity91 , ' this could be the biggest storm since jan. 26 , 2011 , when about 5 inches of snow fell			2
' lows are expected to remain in the subzero range on tuesday night			2
while @entity36 could see highs of about 20 on wednesday , the upper @entity4 probably wo n't see temperatures above the teens			1
while the winter blast is expected to be gone by thursday , meteorologists predict it 'll be followed by another blast of cold air pushing down from @entity118 on friday or saturday			2
@entity119 is possible as far south as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity123 on tuesday as the extent of the precipitation hits its peak into the afternoon and later			2
these areas can expect up to an inch of snow by evening			0
to the @entity133 of the arctic chills , @entity130 in @entity131 and adjoining regions can expect continued problems from the historic drought already plaguing the region			2
life will get slightly better as temperatures rise on wednesday during the day and the arctic plunge begins to rise back toward @entity118 lingering : wednesday night wo n't be a whole lot warmer than the previous two nights , unfortunately third time 's the charm ? the polar chill will start to ease up by wednesday , when temperatures in much of the @entity4 and @entity19 were expected to be closer closer to normal			1
however , a third bitter arctic blast of the season was expected by the weekend overall , temperatures thursday will be warmer than the previous few days , however a return of the dreaded polar plunge is expected by weekend the state is in a period of extended dry weather compounded in @entity131 by repeated periods of the regional @entity156 , dry and powerful winds that blow from the interior toward the coast , pushing back the normal flow of moist ocean air and raising temperatures to summerlike levels			1
the dry conditions statewide led gov. @entity165 to formally declare a drought friday in order to seek a range of federal assistance			0
the statewide water content was about 20 percent of average for this time of year			0
the snow water equivalent on thursday was just 17 percent of normal for the day			0
satellite photos taken this week of the @entity175 snowpack - an important source of water come spring - shows a skinny snake of white in a stark brown landscape			0
on the same day last year , the region was a fluffy , swirling blanket of white			0
elsewhere : while spared from the bitter winter chills , the @entity133 and much of @entity131 remained in the midst of one of the worst droughts in history			1
here , @entity188 , of @entity189 shows the area that was once @entity191 comparison : satellite images from over @entity131 in 2013 ( left ) and 2014 ( right ) show the lack of snowfall and parched land of this year 's drought - plagued winter versus last year 's paired with record heat , the conditions have also helped lead to a ring of fierce wildfires around @entity201			1
the @entity202 said the fire was 78 percent contained by sunday , with full containment expected wednesday			0
the @entity205 of @entity206 asked people of all faiths to join in prayers for rain			0
@entity212 bishop @entity211 , president of the bishops ' conference , suggested a prayer for @entity216 to ' open the heavens and let his mercy rain down upon our fields and mountains			0
' he suggested prayers for relief and for the wellbeing of those most at risk from a water shortage			0
mosques in the @entity229 also prayed for rain earlier this month .			0

the @entity4 will get hit by frigid temperatures return starting monday as the @entity234 's little *brother* forces wind chills past @entity236
the arctic blast will continue south through tuesday as the cold wave *pummels* much of the @entity49 , @entity5 and @entity36
with the *extreme* temperatures will come some of the worst snowfall since 2011 for parts of the *populous* @entity245 *corridor*
@entity10 , much of @entity35 , @entity97 , @entity247 , @entity101 and parts of @entity11 may get the worst snow of the year so far on tuesday
