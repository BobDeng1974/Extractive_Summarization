by @entity0 published : 14:44 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 15:02 est , 6 december 2012 long - lost sisters , who were reunited after 55 years apart , have discovered that they are in fact twins , separated at birth			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , both 64 , had no knowledge of each other after @entity4 was given up for adoption until she tracked down her birth mother in 2003			1
when the pair met , they assumed they were half - sisters but were regularly surprised by their similarities such as the way they held their coffee cups and they would often go to call each other at the same time			0
separated at birth : @entity4 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) discovered they were long - lost twin sisters who have been reunited 55 years later a dna test in 2009 confirmed that they were full sisters but , still confused by their past they looked deeper into their late mother ’s medical records only to discover that she had given birth to two babies on december 2 , 1948 , the date of @entity4 ’s birthday			1
@entity5 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , had always thought she was born on april 4 , 1950 , but medical records showed there had been no birth that day			2
baffled by the mystery , the women believed that the second baby born on @entity4 's birthday had most likely died but recent dna tests have now confirmed that the sisters are actually non-identical twins			1
@entity41 childhood apart : @entity5 ( pictured left at about two - years - old with father @entity42 ) and @entity4 ( pictured right aged about 18 - months - old with her adoptive parents ) were separated when @entity4 was given up for adoption the ‘ difficult ’ discovery means @entity5 is actually 64 - years - old , when she believed she was 62			1
speaking today the sisters said the revelation left them with many unanswered questions about why there were separated at birth			2
but the sisters said they are ‘ happy ’ to finally have each other and have an explanation for the incredible similarities they share despite spending their whole lives apart			0
retired surgical assistant , @entity5 , said : ‘ i have been lied to about my birth all my life			2
‘ all the big dates in my life , like my 21st birthday , have been false			0
‘ this has been an incredible shock and it has been a very difficult time			0
‘ @entity4 and i have gone through a real rollercoaster with this whole story			2
discovering we were twins was happy news but a real shock			0
' difficult ' discovery : @entity5 ( right aged 18 - years - old with mother ) thought she was born on april 4 , 1950 but discovered there had been no birth that day but two babies were born on december 2 , 1948 - @entity4 's birthday ‘ for twins to be separated at birth is hugely emotional , but does go some way to explain the similarities between us			1
we were brought up differently but are so alike			0
’ @entity4 , a former professional golfer , from @entity80 , @entity81 , said : ‘ our mother ’s medical records showed she had had five children , but all had been home births apart from the one in december , 1948 , when she had been in hospital for 11 days which must have been because she had twins			1
‘ it was a huge shock to realise that i was in actual fact a twin but in many ways it made a lot of sense			0
‘ we are very alike , we have the same mannerisms , we hold our coffee cups the same way , we mirror each other on the little things - even when we first met			0
‘ we both have @entity102 dogs too			0
’ @entity4 , who discovered she was adopted when she was 14 , began to search for her birth family in 1981			2
having found her birth - aunt through her birth certificate , she was told her mother did not want to meet her because ‘ too much water had passed under the bridge ’			2
so alike : @entity4 and @entity5 said the revelation was emotionally difficult but it explained their many similarities , despite growing up apart disheartened she went ahead with a move to @entity113 , in @entity114 with her husband @entity115			1
when she returned to @entity117 in 2003 , her cousin had managed to find her biological mother ’s address			0
the mother - of - three plucked up the courage to visit her and was welcomed with open arms by her mother , who showered her with hugs and kisses			0
during the meeting , @entity4 was told by her mother she must leave suddenly because her daughter @entity5 would be home soon , so she returned to @entity114 intrigued by the idea of a sister			1
when @entity4 permanently moved back to the @entity117 in 2007 , her birth mother had passed away , leaving behind a death certificate listing @entity5 as her next of kin			1
@entity4 tacked her down on social networking website @entity133			0
the sisters , who believed they were born in wedlock , say they still have no idea why @entity4 was put up for adoption and @entity5 was kept .			1
