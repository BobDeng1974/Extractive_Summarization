by @entity0 published : 10:26 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 9 october 2013 as creative consultant for luxury leather goods brand @entity3 and ambassador to the @entity6 , @entity1 is usually admired for her chic , pared - back style			1
however , opinion was divided on the unusual ' half - calf ' boots with neoprene panels she wore yesterday on the school run			1
as the name suggests , ‘ half - calf ’ boots sit higher than ankle boots but fall some way short of the knee			1
unlike ankle boots , which stop at the narrowest part of the leg , these draw attention to the calf			2
unflattering : @entity1 wore a pair of £ 80 ' half calf ' boots on the school run in the @entity29 sunshine on tuesday but fashion critics were n't impressed some critics carped that the usually impeccably dressed 42 - year - old had missed the sartorial mark - mainly due to pairing them with a knee - length skirt , which had the effect of truncating her long , slim legs			1
as @entity38 has found , they are not the easiest style to pull off			0
but whoever said fashion was easy ? they have been identified in fashion circles as a key trend for autumn , with similar shapes appearing on the @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity49 catwalks and now filtering on to the high street			0
so , if you 're tired of ankle boots and bored of bikers , why not give them a whirl ? on trend : teaming these boots with a knee - length skirt was a mistake , say fashion critics if you 're looking to jump on the trend without breaking the bank , @entity60 offer their @entity62 for £ 78			1
got some cash to splash ? then @entity66 's £ 911 ' @entity65 ' mid-calf boots will fit the bill			2
to help you avoid a @entity71 - style footwear faux pas , we have called in some of the industry 's most reputable stylists to give their verdict on how to pull off the look			1
@entity76 of blog @entity77 , said : ‘ @entity71 ’s feet are suffering from transitional trend issues			0
' most women with their finger on the fashion pulse will have snapped up key pieces for their autumn wardrobe already , especially coats and boots as these are the first things to sell out , but the long summer is leaving us itching to wear our new season buys			1
' it seems that @entity92 could n’t wait to wear her @entity46 copies with trousers or tights and has taken a leaf out of the street style stars hanging around fashion week tents in midi skirts , bare legs and clumpy ankle boots			2
' " f - ugly " boots are the ultimate way to toughen up a girlie look and very hot right now			2
' @entity1 definitely has the legs for this look , but unfortunately only a 20 - something can pull of such a contrasting style with conviction			1
killer studded courts or even a patent brogue would have been a cooler option			0
’ @entity116 leather and neoprene ankle boots , £ 540 @entity62 , £ 78.00 , @entity60 @entity117 , £ 160 , @entity118 @entity66 ' @entity65 ' mid-calf boot , £ 911 @entity120 , £ 853 principles by @entity123 black cross strap high ankle boot , £ 65 fashion stylist @entity125 who has worked with @entity126 and @entity127 , said : ‘ actually , as far as half - calf boots go , these are n’t the most unflattering i 've seen			1
she 's lucky she has slender legs , however it definitely is n't doing any favours at lengthening them or making them appear slimmer			0
' black tights would work really well here , as they would elongate the leg and blend into the boots			2
' the main problem is the length of the skirt teamed with those boots			0
if the skirt were shorter , it would balance out the legs and body better than the midi style she 's chosen			0
' @entity150 , who styled @entity151 on @entity152 , added : ' @entity71 is always super stylish but wearing these boots with black opaque tights or jeans would be much better than a bare leg as it would streamline the look			1
' the rest of her outfit , however , was more in keeping with her usual elegant look			0
she opted for a navy jacket and fitted dress and carried a £ 595 putty - coloured bag from the @entity168 by @entity3			0
the prime minister 's wife 's bag collection included two dove grey styles and a blue tote bag , all by luxury leather brand @entity3 her usual look : @entity1 and @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity1 wearing her @entity179 dress and @entity181 belt			0

@entity1 wore a pair of £ 80 black ' half - calf ' boots yesterday
the style is a key look for this season - but unflattering if *wrongly* styled
stylists say she should have teamed her @entity193 boots with tights or jeans
