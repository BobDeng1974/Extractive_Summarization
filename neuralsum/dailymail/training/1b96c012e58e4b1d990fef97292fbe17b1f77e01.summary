mr @entity0 argued that a regular can of the drink - which contains 35g or six teaspoons of sugar - was similar in calories to ' a cappuccino or a half a croissant ' the @entity9 president of @entity10 has admitted that some customers ' do n't realise ' how much sugar is in the company 's drinks			1
speaking on @entity15 , @entity0 also conceded that ' things need to change ' and servings had to reduce in size			1
the admission came after @entity20 took him to task on the size of servings available in cinemas - some of which contain a staggering 44 teaspoons of sugar			1
when asked by mr @entity20 what good @entity10 did its consumers , mr @entity0 said : ' it does have some sugar in it ... it has energy , but is it a necessity ? no it 's not			1
but millions of people enjoy it as part of their diet across the @entity41			2
' mr @entity0 also pointed put that a regular can of the drink - which contains 35g or six teaspoons of sugar - was similar in calories to ' a cappuccino or a half a croissant '			1
he stressed that the company was working hard to promote the calorie and sugar content of its products so that consumers could make informed choices			1
but when asked by mr @entity20 if he thought people had any idea how much sugar is in small and large servings of @entity10 at the cinema , he was forced to reply : ' i think maybe they do n't ' , he conceded : ' things need to change and the bigger cups need to come down , ' he said			1
a ' small ' cinema serving is said to contain a 23 teaspoons on sugar , while a large contains 44 - ' each to be consumed in a single sitting , ' mr @entity20 added			1
mr @entity0 argued that the company was n't trying to hide the information and was ' focused ongetting the information out there '			1
' then they can make choices and if they do n't want to buy one ... clearly [ these sizes ] wo n't be for everyone , ' he added			1
but he agreed that the ' bigger cups need to come down ' and there may be ' smaller packages '			2
' i do n't think we are saying that the world ca n't change and does n't need to move on - we do need to recognise that things need to change , ' he said			1
supersize : a ' small ' cinema serving is said to contain a 23 teaspoons on sugar , while a large contains 44 - ' each to be consumed in a single sitting , ' mr @entity20 told mr @entity0 ( right ) @entity41 guidelines recommend that ‘ added ’ sugars - those used to sweeten food , fizzy drinks , honeys , syrups and fruit juices - should n’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food			1
this is around 50g of sugar a day , equivalent to 10 cubes of sugar for adults and older children , and nine for five to ten - year - olds			1
but just one 500ml bottle of @entity10 will send you over this limit , with 10.5 cubes			1
earlier this year @entity10 , the parent company of @entity106 , announced that the fizzy lemon and lime flavoured drink was to be scrapped in favour of a lower - calorie version that uses a ' natural ' sweetener , @entity113			1
the new formulation contains 30 per cent fewer calories			2
the drink was altered as part of @entity10 's anti-obesity drive and followed a call by the government to address the issue			2
@entity41 guidelines recommend that ' added ' sugars - those used to sweeten food , fizzy drinks , honeys , syrups and fruit juices - should n't make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food			1
but just one 500ml bottle of @entity10 will send you over this limit , with 10.5 cubes @entity10 also began airing anti-obesity tv ads this year to ' remind ' viewers that all calories count in managing weight , including those in @entity10 's products			1
aside from @entity106 , the company also said to be exploring more diet options			2
diet drinks already make up nearly half of @entity10 's @entity41 sales , with @entity145 and @entity147 accounting for 45 per cent of sales			2
at the @entity106 announcement the company said that since 2007 , it had reduced the calorie content of @entity152 by 30 per cent , @entity153 by 35 per cent and @entity154 by 56 per cent			2
