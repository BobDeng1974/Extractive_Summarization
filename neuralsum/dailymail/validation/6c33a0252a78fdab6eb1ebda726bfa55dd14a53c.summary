prosecutors maintained @entity23 and his mother had never absolutely demanded a lawyer			0

' it is clear that the defendant wanted to talk to the police without his mother present in the room , ' @entity56 said in his ruling			0
' it is also clear that he had no intention of talking while his mother was in the room			0
' as a result , the judge said , he would allow the statements @entity12 made to @entity60 police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the @entity67 police station			1
