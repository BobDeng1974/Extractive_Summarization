immigration dockets are so backlogged , a @entity2 judge is setting court dates for illegal children for four years from now			2
@entity5 reports that @entity6 , @entity2 , judge @entity7 told at least three minors appearing before his court on tuesday morning that their next hearing would be june 11 , 2018			0
' are you available that day ? ' @entity7 reportedly asked one of the immigrant 's lawyers as a joke			2
immigration courts are so backlogged that they are scheduling hearings for newly arrived illegal immigrant children for up to four years from now ' i do n’t have my 2018 calendar in front of me , but yes , i believe so , ' the lawyer told him			1
have a good school year , ' @entity7 told the minor , a 17 - year - old boy named @entity26			2
' i ’ll see you in a few years , okay ? ' with 375,000 immigration cases stuck on judges ' dockets , illegal immigrants of all ages are routinely made to wait years for a full hearing			1
the average processing time for a case now stands at 520 days , according to @entity36			1
the @entity37 recently instituted a policy requiring courts to give children immigrants their initial hearing within three weeks of their arrival in the @entity44 in an effort to try to get the process moving more quickly			1
but the deluge of immigrant children entering the country illegally with or without a guardian still has courts tied in knots			1
in the case of the @entity2 court observed by @entity5 , the judge was spent just four minutes a piece on each minor and was still only able to make it through 35 cases that morning			0
a reporter for @entity62 's @entity61 who observed the same courtroom in mid-august said the judge made it through 38 names the day he was there			0
by comparison , roughly 250 unaccompanied minors were illegally entering the country each day at the beginning of this summer			0
the @entity44 predicts that by the end of this month , as many as 90,000 immigrant children , many of whom are from @entity75 , will have arrived since last year			1
according to data from the @entity79 , the court system has just 243 immigration judges at present			0
president @entity81 has requested emergency funds from @entity83 to pay for more immigration judges and other immigration - related expenses , but the @entity86 and the @entity87 were unable to come to an agreement on how much money to appropriate to the problem before they left for the summer break			1
lawmakers will return to @entity94 next week , however they will have just 12 work days to hash out their differences on the immigration spending bill and a host of other issues before closing up shop again until after november 's elections			0
immigrant children are sent to public school while they away their hearing dates			1
educating illegal immigrant children will cost an estimated $ 761 million this year judges could make the immigration process go faster by issuing deportation notices to illegal children who do n't show up for their initial hearings , but they often do n't given how little warning minors are now given before their court dates			1
' it 's just not efficient to go so fast that challenges can be made to the due process , ' immigration judge @entity113 told the @entity117 at the end of july			1
' it ends up making the cases take longer overall and results in longer appeals , so no one is happy , ' she said			0
furthermore , government officials are prohibited from deporting illegal children as soon as they enter the country unless they are from @entity126 or @entity127			2
@entity86 @entity128 passed legislation last month that would amend the law to allow @entity75 children to be immediately sent home			1
there 's little to no chance that the @entity135 - led @entity87 will take up the measure , though			2
without additional funding from @entity83 or a change in the law , immigration courts could continue to be jam - packed for years			1
in the meantime , illegal immigrant children are released back to their parents or guardians and sent off to school at the expense of the school district 's taxpayers			1
the @entity148 estimates that 37,000 unaccompanied minors enrolled in school this fall and will cost schools $ 761 million this year to educate			1
residents of @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity2 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 will pay the biggest price , @entity148 says			0
those seven states will be on the hook for more than $ 50 million a piece this year to educate illegal immigration children			1
@entity153 alone will be responsible for $ 147.7 million of the total amount			2
educators are unable to turn away students simply because they know or suspect they are illegal immigrants			0
the @entity167 has ruled that public schools can not require children to provide proof of citizenship in order to enroll			2
in may the @entity173 sent a joint memo to teachers reminding them of the rules as attorney general @entity177 announced that the @entity37 would do ' everything it can ' to make sure students of all origins are receiving equal protection under the law			0
soon after , schools began publicly complaining about the crippling costs associated with educating illegal children			0
one @entity187 town said double the number of foreign born students have enrolled in its educational system throughout the last two years than did before			0
this school year the town 's educational system took on more than 600 new foreign students , 248 of whom were from @entity195 , it 's mayor , @entity196 , said			0
roughly half of the @entity195 children who enrolled in the @entity199 , @entity187 school district , 126 , are known to be illegal immigrants , @entity196 told @entity201 25			0
@entity196 noted that ' it 's gotten to the point where the school system is overwhelmed , our health department is overwhelmed , the city 's budget is being sustainably altered in order of accommodate all of these admissions in the school department			0
' the school district 's superintendent told @entity201 25 that the influx of students has created overcrowding , and the district is having to spend it 's limited financial resources on hiring more teachers and paying for the necessary vaccinations for newly enrolled students			0
' the way this is going , @entity199 looks like a microcosm of the @entity44 , in that we have been filled to capacity and we ca n't take anymore without having the people who are already here suffer , ' @entity196 said .			2

@entity44 law prohibits the government from sending children from *non-contiguous* states back to their home countries without due process
the average wait time for a full hearing is 520 days but it can take between two and four years
meanwhile , llegal immigrant children are sent to public school systems ; educating them will cost taxpayers approximately $ 761 million this year
president @entity81 asked @entity83 for funds for more judges , but the @entity86 and @entity87 were n't able to come to an agreement before august recess
