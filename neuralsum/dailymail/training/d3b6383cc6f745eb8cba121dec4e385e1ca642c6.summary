in silence : miss @entity8 had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat , and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her prayers : @entity8 's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a ' miracle ' the flesh - eating bacteria , @entity75 , emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body			1

stoic : @entity8 has now been removed from a ventilator at the @entity32 hospital after contracting a flesh - eating bacteria ' @entity8 is being @entity8			1
she 's cracking jokes , speaking frankly , displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours			0
' when miss @entity8 learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on may 19 , she responded by saying : ' let 's do this			1
' mr @entity45 wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after she contracted the condition			0
he said she ' shed no tears , she never batted an eyelash			0
i was crying because i am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady ' , @entity45 wrote			0
he said he was finally able to tell his daughter after she began communicating what had happened since that outing , and how she 's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world			0
' we told her that the world loved and admired her , ' he wrote			0
' we explained that she had become a symbol of hope , love and faith			0
' difficult times : miss @entity8 was only given a small chance of survival as she battled the infection distraught : @entity154 , centre , cried as her parents @entity23 and @entity7 spoke about @entity8 after she had her leg amputated he recalled how @entity8 's eyes widened and her jaw dropped			1
then , mr @entity45 took his daughter 's hands and held them up to her face			2
' she did n't draw back in horror			0
she knew the condition she was in , ' he wrote			0
he explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress , and they must be removed			1
@entity8 nodded , her father said			1
' she smiled and raised her hands up , carefully examining them , ' her father wrote			2
' she then looked at us			0
we all understood her next three words - " let 's do this "			2
' doctors had hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber , in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing			1
cherished : miss @entity8 , a 24 - year - old graduate from @entity32 , has fun with friends he said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counsellor was available to help miss @entity8 once she was informed of her condition			1
losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally , and can be particularly difficult for young people , said dr @entity191 , chief psychologist at @entity192 in @entity193			0
' there is a process that they go through , a grief process , ' said dr @entity191 , who is not involved in miss @entity8 's care			1
' there is shock , disbelief , anger , sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life			0
' miss @entity8 's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection			1
' she 's going to be here for months , ' he said			0

she 's going to still be on dialysis for a while			0
' fun loving : @entity8 's father , @entity7 , says describes her as ' outdoorsy ' and a ' lover of people ' necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
' @entity228 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			2
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			2
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons .			0
