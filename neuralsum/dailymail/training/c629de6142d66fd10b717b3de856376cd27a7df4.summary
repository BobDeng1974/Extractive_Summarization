the most bizarre twist in the @entity2 saga came on a january night in 2013 when , by pure chance , a @entity4 journalist learned for the first time of the extent of the police spying operation mounted against this newspaper			2
the paper ’s news editor @entity10 – who had met both @entity2 ’s ex-wife @entity12 and her friend , judge @entity14 – was having a snack in the @entity18 @entity17 restaurant just yards from our offices in @entity21 , @entity22 at around 9.30pm			1
he did n’t pay much attention when a well - dressed blonde woman in her 40s sat down next to him at one of the communal tables in the tiny diner			1
@entity10 happened to glance across – and to his astonishment , saw his own name jumping out at him , alongside his mobile phone number			2
then he noticed the names of @entity12 , @entity14 and our original source , freelance journalist @entity46 , who the @entity47 had mounted a £ 150,000 legal battle to keep anonymous			0
the spreadsheet was entitled : ‘ @entity52 telephone data			0
’ one column gave the duration of calls and other columns the numbers and the names			0
mystified as to how the woman could have obtained confidential information , @entity10 asked her if she was a journalist			1
the @entity18 @entity17 restaurant in @entity21 , where the @entity4 man saw his name on secret papers the woman said she was not a journalist , nor a police officer			1
@entity10 , 48 , recalled : ‘ she then asked me why i was asking and i told her that i had seen my name on the paperwork			0
' she became very flustered and prepared to leave even though her meal had only just arrived			0
as she stood i asked her if she was a lawyer and she said , “ i am @entity2 ’s lawyer , ” adding , “ you must be @entity10 ” then she hurried out			1
’ the diner was later identified as @entity30 , a partner of law firm @entity74 .			0

news editor @entity10 was having a snack at a @entity17 restaurant
a woman in her 40s sat down next to him at the communal tables
she then opened a file of papers and he noticed his name and number
when asked why she had it , she became flustered and prepared to leave
then *admitted* she was @entity2 's lawyer before *hurrying* out
