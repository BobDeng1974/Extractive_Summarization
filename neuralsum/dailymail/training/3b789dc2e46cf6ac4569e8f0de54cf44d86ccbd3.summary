while a guest on author @entity9 's podcast , @entity0 spoke about her frustration with gay men not supporting feminists causes , with some comments drawing criticism from the gay community			1
' gay men are as misogynistic as straight men , if not more so , ' the actor claimed			0
' i have an indictment of the gay community right now , i ’m actually really upset with them			2

mic reports that activist groups such as @entity44 and celebrities including @entity46 boycotted the chain over the @entity49 's proposed introduction of @entity51 law to the @entity53 nation			1
@entity9 , who identifies as gay , called the boycott a ' form of narcissistic , self - victimization , gay insanity ' and said that criticism of the new laws was based on ' illusionary and tenuous ' information about the codes			1
under @entity51 as it would be interpreted in @entity65 , acts of sodomy and adultery criminal would be considered criminal and allows for punishment by death			2
@entity0 , who held an anti-boycott party at the @entity70 's @entity69 over the summer , called activists boycotting the chain ' delusional idiots ' and attacked them for not being critical of countries engaging in violence against women			2

' i have not heard @entity90 , ' an @entity92 activist , ' discuss her , and nor will he			0
' ' women , by - and - large , have very much helped the gay community get to where they are today , ' she noted			2

she related an anecdote about a gay friend calling @entity118 from the tv series @entity120 a ' slut			0
' ' i asked why he 'd say that so thoughtlessly			0
if i 'm not supposed to say ( and i do n't ) " that 's so gay , " surely this man can start thinking about why it 's acceptable to slut - shame			0
he thanked me for opening his eyes			0
