by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:56 am on 12th august 2011 the @entity3 @entity2 fined three strawberry growers $ 73,000 after finding children between the ages of six and 11 working in their fields			1
the children were found working in fields of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in southwest @entity14			1
while an exemption in the federal child labour law allows 12 and 13 - year - olds to work for unlimited hours on large agricultural operations , children under the age of 12 are strictly prohibited from working under similar conditions			2
them , along with @entity37 , have taken steps to remive the underage workers from their fields and will be required to attend training conducted by the federal government over the next three years , according to a @entity44 statement			2
@entity45 , an attorney with @entity46 in @entity47 , told @entity26 that the low wages made by workers in the @entity51 berry industry are a key factor driving young kids into the fields			2
she said that berry pickers , who are usually paid a piece rate instead of an hourly wage , often struggle to make the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour			1
slave labour : @entity62 pickers , who are usually paid a piece rate instead of an hourly wage , often struggle to make the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour harm : as well as dangers of sharp tools and pesticides , the kids hurt their knees and backs from the hard labour they are forced to do she said : ' minimum wage laws are not being followed with the adults who are working in this industry			1
across the board , we see people making $ 5 or fewer an hour			1
' people ca n't make minimum wage by the piece and so if they have another set of little hands adding to the pile of berries , they might be able to make enough to live on			0
' she said that harvesting low - growing strawberry plants can be arduous work for children			0
' the kind of work that kids are doing on commercial farms , i think , is fundamentally different than the kind of berry - picking people did as kids 50 years ago			0
attorney : @entity45 , with @entity46 in @entity47 , said the low wages made by workers are a key factor driving young kids into the fields ' we 're talking about kids who are picking 100 to 200 pounds of berries a day			0
in strawberries , that 's a lot of stooping and standing			0
' they complain to us about backaches - their backs hurt when they sleep at night - and we see these horribly bruised knees			0
' the $ 8,117 - per - child penalties assessed in the recent @entity14 cases appear to be a significant increase from the $ 1,100 - per - child average fine charged to blueberry growers in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 found to be illegal employing under - age children in the summer of 2009 .			1
