yesterday the leader of an anarchist group known as @entity9 posted live excerpts on @entity11 of what appeared to be a briefing of counter-terrorism officers in which they discuss a property historically linked to the @entity16 among other operations			1
a group known as @entity9 said they had ‘ hacked ’ @entity5 ’s secure communication system by exploiting old technology dating back to the 1980s			1
concerning : a teenager claims to have eavesdropped on a highly sensitive conversation between intelligence officers after ' phone - bombing ' @entity5 's anti-terrorism hotline they also claimed responsibility for jamming the hotline by making more than 700 prank calls , boasting that it was ‘ easy ’ to drop ‘ a 24 - hour phone bomb ’ on elite security officers			1
but last night the @entity33 insisted its systems had not been breached and said that any recording would have been made via the receiving handset , raising the possibility that the group may have made the recording after an officer failed to replace the handset properly			0
detectives have now vowed to take ‘ appropriate action ’ after a number of recordings were posted on @entity11 by the group			1
last night two teenagers , aged 16 and 17 , were arrested at an address in the @entity48 on suspicion of offences under the @entity50 and the @entity51			1
a @entity5 spokesman said the pair were in custody in the @entity48			1
denials : @entity56 , director of information for the @entity33 , dismissed claims that @entity5 systems had been breached it had already been linked to alleged hacking attempts on @entity61 and a personal email account connected to a former staff member of former prime minister @entity64			2
in one of the clips , a male identifying himself as ‘ trick ’ is heard telling an officer : ‘ knowledge is power ... we embarrass governments and f * * * the police			2
’ ‘ trick ’ is later heard laughing when a woman comes on the line to tell him the phone call was being passed on to the @entity79			2
the group claimed the calls were made to @entity83 , but they were in fact picked up by the @entity33 ’s counter-terrorism command			0
‘ trick ’ , reportedly a 17 - year - old who launched @entity9 in 2010 , emailed the @entity87 yesterday , claiming that the group bypassed outdated technology to compromise a server from @entity90 to record conversations			1
he said : ‘ the phone denial of service was done via a custom script for @entity95 which was installed on an overseas server			0
‘ the conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method , their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique			0
’ twitter messages suggested a variety of motives for the attack on the @entity108 , including government plans to boost digital surveillance powers and @entity112 ’s extradition treaty with the @entity113 , which critics say is biased in @entity116 ’s favour			0
the messages warned there would be further attacks on @entity112 government websites every saturday			0
but last night @entity56 , director of information for the @entity33 , dismissed claims that @entity5 systems had been breached			0

‘ we are confident the @entity33 communication systems have not been breached and remain , as they always have been , secure			2
‘ we are satisfied that any recording would have been made via the receiving handset only and not from an attack on internal systems			0
‘ the public can remain confident in the ability to communicate in confidence and that the integrity of the anti-terrorist hotline remains in place			0
