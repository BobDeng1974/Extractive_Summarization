a new report has blasted three years of ' inexplicable delays ' to prosecute former @entity3 football coach @entity2 on child abuse charges			1
the report compiled by former federal prosecutor @entity6 and released by the @entity8 attorney general 's office said that poor decisions made in 2009 led to the ' serial child molester ' escaping justice			2
the pedophile 's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year , from march 2009 until march 2010 , for the office to recommend charging @entity2 when ' @entity17 ' came forward			2
the report , commissioned by attorney general @entity36 and written by former federal prosecutor @entity37 , blamed a three - year time lapse in filing charges on communication problems , an expungement of a 1998 complaint about the former @entity3 coach and a failure to take certain investigative steps early on			1
' the facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator , ' said @entity50 , a @entity51 who had vowed to conduct a review of the investigation while running for office			0
' the report documents that more investigative work took place in just one month in 2011 than in all of either 2009 or 2010			0
' then - attorney general @entity58 , a @entity59 , was in the midst of his successful 2010 gubernatorial campaign during the @entity2 investigation			0
@entity6 said his review , including internal emails by state prosecutors , ' revealed no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the @entity2 investigation			0
' guilty : former @entity3 assistant football coach @entity2 , walks with his wife @entity69 into the @entity27 , on june 22 , 2012 in @entity28 , @entity8 as a candidate in 2012 , @entity50 said @entity58 may have had a political motive to slow down the investigation , an assertion @entity58 denied			1
the arrest of @entity2 led to the firing of longtime @entity3 coach @entity76 while @entity58 was serving as a university trustee ; @entity3 alumni and fans have objected to how @entity76 was treated			1
@entity58 spokesman @entity80 said monday that the investigation was conducted with the victims at the forefront			0
' it was a thorough , thoughtful investigation , and in the end a child predator can no longer victimize anyone , ' @entity80 said			0
@entity2 was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving decades in prison sentence			1
the report said the lead prosecutor at the time , @entity30 , hectored her bosses about the case during a stretch in 2010 when the probe was largely dormant			0
@entity30 drafted a grand jury report in march 2010 based on the claims of a lone victim , but she spent much of the ensuing months — as @entity58 won the primary — trying to get approval for the report			0
sacked : @entity76 arrives home after being fired in the aftermath of child sex - abuse charges against former defensive coordinator @entity2 ' in the interim , no witnesses were interviewed , no witnesses testified in the grand jury and no grand jury subpoenas were issued , ' @entity6 wrote			1
he said the basis for that decision was that one accuser 's testimony would n't be enough to convict @entity2 and an acquittal would make it harder to file more charges later			0
according to the report , prosecutors told @entity6 they waited until 2011 to search @entity2 's home computer and subpoena child protective services records because they ' believed that they were unlikely to be productive and would have risked publicly revealing the existence of the investigation			1
' two days after @entity58 was elected governor in november 2010 , the @entity27 prosecutor received an anonymous tip directing investigators to assistant football coach @entity127 , whose testimony would eventually help convict @entity2			1
the investigation picked up steam after that , and authorities subpoenaed key figures at @entity3 , including @entity76 , vice president @entity134 and athletic director @entity135			2
additional victims were identified , and on june 21 , 2011 , @entity2 's home was searched , producing photos and typewritten lists of children who participated in events at @entity2 's charity , @entity143 , with some names highlighted			2
special deputy attorney general h. @entity145 speaks at a news conference as @entity8 state attorney general @entity36 , left , listens , as the results are released of a probe into the @entity2 child molestation investigation on monday , june 23 @entity8 attorney gen. @entity36 : @entity50 has released a report with new details on how police and prosecutors handled the @entity2 child molestation investigation cleared : @entity8 gov. @entity58 talks to reporters in march 2014 - before the publication of the damning report into the prosecution of @entity2 more resources early on , including additional investigators , may not have speeded up the case , @entity6 said , because the best leads in 2010 and early 2011 were not related to how many detectives were devoted to the matter			1
he said decisions not to bring charges based solely on one accuser or , in june 2011 , after three more witnesses had testified before a grand jury , ' fit within acceptable bounds of prosecutorial discretion			0
' @entity6 noted that if authorities had put together a broad - based team early on , it 's possible someone may have known about or turned up a 1998 police investigation of @entity2 prompted by a mother 's complaint that the coach had showered with her son			1
that report had been expunged , one reason for the lengthy investigation , he said			0
@entity58 said ' electoral politics did not enter his thinking in any way , ' @entity6 wrote , concluding the campaign donations @entity58 received from people associated with @entity143 do not appear to have affected the investigation			0
the report does not go into depth about actions at @entity3 , where three former administrators await trial on charges they participated in a criminal cover - up of complaints about @entity2			2
the university eventually accepted a set of penalties from the @entity203 over its handling of the matter , including a four - year bowl ban , a temporary reduction in football scholarships , the loss of 112 wins from @entity76 's later years and a $ 60 million fine .			1
