by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 8 july 2013 as 12 million @entity3 hayfever sufferers struggle with the worst season for years , they are turning to private clinics for a ' wonder - cure ' jab the @entity7 no longer offers because it is too ' toxic '			1
internet forums have been swamped by people fuming at not being able to get the injections from their gps			1
for many years , kenalog jabs were prescribed to those with the most severe symptoms , but they were withdrawn when it was realised they left patients at greater risk from contagious illnesses			2
suffering : people with hayfever are turning to private clinics who inject patients with a powerful drug which the @entity7 has rejected as ' toxic ' the injection contains the drug triamcinolone , a corticosteroid that suppresses the body 's immune system to prevent allergic reactions to pollen			1
but it leaves the body open to infections such as chicken pox and measles , for three weeks after being administered			1
other potential side effects include bone pain , easy bruising and bleeding , severe stomach and abdominal pain , shortness of breath and irregular heartbeats			1
the 50mg or 100mg doses are 10 or 20 times stronger than the oral steroid tablets now offered on the @entity7			0
in tablet form the steroid can be regulated for its effect on the body			2
keeping the pollen at bay : a sufferer wears a mask in a field of rape seed			0
jabs have been withdrawn by @entity12 by suppressing the immune system , kenalog also leaves people unable to cope with serious illness or the trauma caused by an accident or sudden shock , for example being in a car crash			1
many of those posting on the internet believe the kenalog jabs have been withdrawn as a cost - cutting measure , but doctors fear the public simply does not realise how harmful this powerful drug can be			1
desperate : there are 12 million people with hayfever in @entity3 who are suffering in the worst season for years dr @entity81 , who edits the @entity82 , said : ' let 's be clear , it 's incredibly effective but just as you can light a barbecue with petrol , you can treat hayfever with kenalog , and i seriously suggest you do n't because of the dangers associated with it			1
' @entity93 does not have a place in treating hayfever , due to its significant side effects			1
' for three weeks after having the injection your immune system is suppressed , which means you are seriously at risk of infections like chicken pox and measles			2
' likewise if you have a serious illness or a road traffic accident , you may not be able to cope with the stress , with kenalog suppressing your own stress reactions			0
' dr @entity81 said oral steroid tablets when needed , combined with daily antihistamine tablets , nasal sprays and eye drops , work for most sufferers			0
this combination could be needed during the heatwave forecast for the rest of july			0
dr @entity118 , a gp from @entity120 , added : ' this is not a drug that is suitable for hayfever , because its side effects outweigh dramatically any possible benefits			1
' you can get the benefits in far less toxic ways			0
' @entity126 , from the @entity127 and @entity128 , warned that the pollen count will return to ' very high ' for the next two weeks			0
she said : ' the good news is that the better the weather during the main flowering season , the shorter the season will be , as the grasses become exhausted of pollen under continuing favourable conditions			2
' the bad news is that very high counts mean greater symptoms for sufferers and a higher number of people are affected			2
' we are now about halfway through the main grass pollen season			0
' @entity147 weather forecast for much of july in the @entity148 means that the season should be over before the end of the month			0
' in the northern regions , the weather outlook is not so good and this will extend the season a little into august , although there will be a mixture of risk over that time period			0

twelve million people suffering in the worst season for years
