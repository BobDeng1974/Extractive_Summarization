by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 04:35 est , 27 april 2012 a telescope is being built that scientists say ‘ will transform our understanding of the universe ’			0
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is being put together by the @entity6 in the @entity7 , which boasts in a statement that it ‘ will capture the widest , fastest and deepest view of the night sky ever observed ’			1
this is because it packs a 3.2billion - pixel camera that will survey the entire visible sky every week , creating an unprecedented public archive of data – about six million gigabytes per year			1
snap happy : the camera on the @entity5 will ' transform our knowledge of the universe ' the telescope will be placed at @entity22 in northern @entity23 this is the equivalent of shooting roughly 800,000 images with a regular eight - megapixel digital camera every night , but of much higher quality and scientific value			1
its deep and frequent cosmic vistas will help answer critical questions about the nature of dark energy and dark matter and aid studies of near - @entity37 asteroids , kuiper belt objects , the structure of our galaxy and many other areas of astronomy and fundamental physics			0
‘ with 189 sensors and over three tons of components that have to be packed into an extremely tight space , you can imagine this is a very complex instrument , ’ said @entity45 , the project manager for the @entity5 camera at @entity6			1
size matters : this graphic shows just how big the @entity5 camera is high flyers : the mountain - top site in @entity23 should be operational by 2014 ‘ but given the enormous challenges required to provide such a comprehensive view of the universe , it ’s been an incredible opportunity to design something so unique			1
’ ‘ this is the culmination of years of work by a large group of dedicated people , ’ said @entity6 ’s @entity62 , @entity5 deputy project director			2
‘ i ’ve personally been working on this since 2003 , and it is tremendously satisfying to finally see this move forward to the point when we can begin to carry out the project			0
’ if all continues as planned , construction on the telescope will begin in 2014			0
preliminary work has already started on @entity5 ’s 8.4 - metre primary mirror and its final site atop @entity22 in northern @entity23			1
as the primary component of all energy in the universe , the still - mysterious dark energy is perhaps the most important research target for @entity5 and the physicists who are building it			2
yet that ’s only a start			0
@entity5 ’s fire hose of publicly available data will allow astronomers the world over to view faint and rapidly changing objects , create 3d maps and time lapses of the night sky and detail @entity96 ’s celestial neighbourhood , the @entity97			2
‘ not only should lsst revolutionize our understanding of the universe , its contents and the laws that govern its behaviour , but it will also transform the way all of us , from kindergarteners to professional astrophysicists , use telescopes , ’ said @entity98 , @entity5 director and a professor of physics at the @entity101			0
‘ these are exciting times ! ’			0

the camera will take the equivalent of 800,000 images by an eight - mega pixel camera every night - but of a *vastly* *superior* quality
it will be housed in the @entity5 in @entity23
