former @entity1 captain @entity0 claims @entity3 's side have struggled at the start of the season because of @entity7 's absence			1
the midfielder missed the first three months of the season due to ankle surgery as @entity1 laboured to just three wins in their opening nine games			1
the 33 - year - old was an unused substitute in draws against @entity14 and @entity15 as he regains full fitness but @entity0 thinks the @entity18 derby on sunday could be a game too soon for @entity7			1
@entity1 star @entity7 got 64 minutes under his belt for the @entity22 side last week ' @entity7 's been a big miss to @entity1 , ' @entity0 told the @entity24			1
' when he was injured last season he was a big loss to us and again this season			0
' he 's an intelligent player who gets into the right areas			0
he 's about 6ft 2ins and defensively at set plays is very good			2
he intercepts things very well			0
that 's why he 's important as well			0
' the only thing the manager has to be careful of is , if there are a few players coming back from injury , you do n't want to play too many who are a little bit rusty because it 's a derby game			1
@entity7 was an unused substitute against @entity14 and @entity15 as he closes in on a return to the first team ' it 's going to be a million miles an hour , loads of passion and pace , so the lads who have been playing week in week out are probably more up to speed with the game			1
' @entity0 has backed returning club captain @entity48 to make a big impact at the @entity50 in the @entity18 derby on sunday , also suggesting @entity53 's last - gasp equaliser against @entity15 was a perfect confidence boost for @entity1			1
' in the first half the lads performed well against a very good @entity15 side , full of pace and power , ' he added			0
' @entity15 are well established and rightly one of the favourites to win the title			0
@entity53 scored a late equaliser against league leaders @entity15 at @entity65 last sunday captain @entity48 could return for the @entity18 derby after serving a three - game suspension ' @entity1 are in a transitional period with new players and new manager but after going a goal down they showed good character to come back and get a point			1
' that should set them up nicely , going into the derby			2
@entity48 's coming back , hopefully a few of the other injured players will be fit and ready			2
that sets it up really nicely for a good derby game			0
' in these sort of games you need special players who can do special things and @entity48 is one of those players			2
' it 's not just his ability but also his attitude			0
if the manager tells him to play in any position he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the team ... that 's why he has achieved so much in his career already			0
