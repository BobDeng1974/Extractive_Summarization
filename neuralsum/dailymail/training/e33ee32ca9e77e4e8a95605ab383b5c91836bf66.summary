when @entity0 stood up and denounced ' the greatest crime in history ' in 1942 the @entity4 politician was revealing to the world for the first time the full horror of the unfolding @entity7			1
three years before the liberation of the death camps , @entity8 issued his clarion call but also sowed the seeds of his own destruction warning it would ' be a shame to go on living ' if nothing were done			0
just a year later , the @entity18 activist took his own life in his @entity21 apartment when he realised that @entity23 leaders and world opinion could not or would not do anything to stop the horror			2
until now , however , the extraordinary story of this left - wing activist and politician has remained cloaked in obscurity despite the fact that @entity8 's secret network help expose the @entity49			1
born in eastern @entity4 , @entity8 became heavily active within @entity18 trade unions and when @entity52 invaded @entity4 in 1939 he took part in organising the @entity41 defence committee			1
when the @entity39 ordered @entity18 leaders to help with the creation of a ghetto in the @entity4 capital , @entity8 publicly opposed the command - and was subsequently smuggled out of the city			1
after travelling to @entity62 , @entity63 and the @entity64 , where he spoke at a series of meetings to raise awareness about the plight of @entity18 , he eventually found himself in @entity21 in march 1942			2
realising that he was dealing with a sceptical @entity71 public , @entity8 used @entity73 newspapers and the @entity74 to pass on detailed information he was being supplied with from occupied @entity77			0
in june 1942 , @entity79 headline read ' @entity52 murder 700,000 @entity18 in @entity4 ' and readers were told it was ' the greatest massacre in the world 's history			1
' exposed : his network of informers were able to supply information about what was happening to the @entity18 in @entity77 - estimating about 700,000 had been killed by june 1942			1
pictured : children at @entity90 in 1945 horrifying : by the end of the war , 11million people had died in the @entity7 , of whom six million were @entity18 the source for this story was @entity0 , by now a member of the @entity4 government in exile , who provided information that ' an average of 1,000 @entity18 were being gassed daily '			1
@entity8 's network of informants had gathered eye - witness accounts from across @entity77 , not least the industrial scale of the mass murder with gas chambers being used			2
although @entity109 had denounced the @entity31 crimes against the @entity18 as a ' crime without a name ' as early as 1941 , credible and detailed evidence was supplied by @entity8 and his network for the first time			1
speaking to the @entity74 , he said : ' it will actually be a shame to go on living , to belong to the human race , if steps are not taken to halt the greatest crime in human history			1
' in the name of millions of helpless , innocent , doomed people in the ghettos , whose unseen hands are stretched out to the world , i beseech you , you whose conscience is still alive : expunge the raging shame which is being perpetrated against the human race			2
' ' crime without a name ' : @entity73 prime minister @entity109 publicly denounced the killings , but help was not forthcoming immediately delay : it would take another two and a half years for the @entity137 to liberate the death camps @entity8 warned them about in 1942			1
pictured : holocaust survivor @entity140 ( centre ) is overcome by emotion during the 70th anniversary of the liberation of @entity90 one of the key pieces in this jigsaw was the @entity148 @entity147 , who was the link between the @entity4 underground resistance and the @entity4 government in exile in @entity21			2
when he was in the @entity41 , @entity147 relied on a guide called @entity154 , who also belonged to the @entity156 , the same @entity18 left - wing organisation that @entity8 was a member of			1
but when @entity147 relayed the situation to the @entity73 and @entity64 governments , as well as @entity8 , in late 1942 it became clear that the @entity137 were unable or unwilling to act			2
when @entity0 asked @entity147 what message , if any , he had from the @entity18 trapped in the @entity41 , @entity147 relayed a message from @entity8 's comrade @entity154			1
@entity147 later revealed the message from @entity154 : ' this is what they want from their leaders in the free countries of the world , this is what they told me to say : " let them go to all the important @entity175 and @entity64 offices and agencies			0
tell them not to leave until they obtain guarantees that a way has been decided upon to save the @entity18			0
let them accept no food or drink , let them die a slow death while the world is looking on			0
this may shake the conscience of the world			0
" ' in april 1943 , the @entity64 and @entity73 governments met in @entity190 , supposedly to come up with answers to the unfolding plight of @entity18 in occupied @entity77			0
ironically this happened just as the @entity18 resistance rose up the @entity41 despite facing overwhelming numbers of well armed @entity31 troops			1
an estimated 13,000 @entity18 died during the uprising and the 50,000 or so survivors were immediately shipped to extermination camps			2
uprising : in 1943 , the @entity64 and @entity73 governments met in @entity190 to discuss the plight of the @entity18 in @entity77			0
at the same time , the @entity18 people living in the @entity41 ghetto began to fight back hope : @entity8 was hopeful something was finally being done by the @entity23 forces dashed : but he realised that they were not going to act - and the people of the @entity41 ghetto were being taken to their deaths in may , @entity8 realised that the @entity137 were not going to act and then , to compound his despair , he learnt that his wife @entity210 and son @entity211 had died in @entity41			1
that month he took an overdose of sodium amytal at his home in west @entity21 and left a long and detailed suicide note , explaining his decision to take his own life			0
he wrote : ' i can not continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of @entity220 , whose representative i am , are being murdered			0
' my comrades in the @entity41 ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle			1
i was not permitted to fall like them , together with them , but i belong with them , to their mass grave			0
' by my death , i wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the @entity18 people			2
' heartbroken : at about this time , @entity8 learnt his wife and son had been killed in the ghetto uprising suicide note : ' i can not continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of @entity220 , whose representative i am , are being murdered , ' he wrote parting shot : ' by looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children , women and men they have become partners to the responsibility , ' he added but he also issued a parting shot in the direction of world opinion and the @entity23 leaders who had singularly failed to act in any shape or form to try and bring a halt to the slaughter			1
he wrote : ' the responsibility for the crime of the murder of the whole @entity18 nationality in @entity4 rests first of all on those who are carrying it out , but indirectly it falls also upon the whole of humanity , on the peoples of the @entity23 nations and on their governments , who up to this day have not taken any real steps to halt this crime			1
' by looking on passively upon this murder of defenceless millions tortured children , women and men they have become partners to the responsibility			0
' after the war @entity147 , who died in 2000 , expressed his regret that he had ' stupidly repeated the message which @entity154 gave me ' and that @entity8 had then ' lost control '			0
when @entity147 heard of the death , he said : ' i was crushed			0
i realised at that time at that time that everything is lost for the @entity18			0
he was a soldier to the end			0
yes , he was a genuine martyr			0
' but the story does n't end on an entirely sad note because one of @entity0 's children did survive			1
@entity291 became a leading light in the @entity4 resistance during the war and eventually made his way to the @entity64 where he became a scientist in the @entity64 space programme before he died in 1995			2
@entity291 's sons @entity299 and @entity300 both live in the @entity64 .			0

@entity0 was the first to reveal full horror of the @entity7 in 1942
his network of informers helped expose the @entity31 's ' final solution '
denounced it as ' the greatest crime in history ' and called on people to help
but the @entity4 politician found his cries were falling on deaf ears
committed suicide in protest after his wife and son died in @entity41 ghetto
