they have been linked to ufos and hallucinations and thought to be harbingers of doom			0
now scientists claim to have unravelled more details about a family of mysterious floating orbs , known as ' earthquake lights ' the lights , which take many forms and appear before or during earthquakes , could provide an early warning sign			1
these lights were seen before the 2008 @entity21 earthquake in @entity22 for instance , seconds before the 2009 @entity24 , @entity26 earthquake struck , pedestrians saw 10cm high flames of light flickering above the stone - paved @entity30 in the town ’s historical city centre			1
in 1988 a bright purple - pink globe of light moved through the sky along the @entity36 near the city of @entity38 , 11 days before a powerful quake			2
and in 1906 , about 100km northwest of @entity41 , a couple saw streams of light running along the ground two nights preceding the devastating earthquake that destroyed much of the city			2
the rare earthquake lights are more likely to occur on or near a rift , an elongated depression or trough in the @entity51 ’s crust bounded on both sides by normal faults , than other faults			1

an earthquake light is a rare and unusual luminous phenomenon that appears before or during earthquakes but rarely afterwards			1
they are more likely to occur on or near a rift - an elongated depression or trough in the @entity51 ’s crust bounded on both sides by normal faults - than other faults			1
stress - activated mobile electronic charge carriers , termed positive holes , flow swiftly along stress gradients			1
upon reaching the surface , they ionise air molecules and generate the observed light			1
many sightings have confirmed that they have shapes similar to those of the auroras , with a white to bluish hue			0
scientists are still unsure why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults			1

@entity90 rift environments now appear to be the common factor associated with earthquake lights			0
looking back at 65 of the best recorded incidents earthquake lights were recorded in @entity95 and @entity96 documents dating from the 1600s , 85 percent appeared spatially on or near rifts			2
and 97 per cent appeared adjacent to a type of fault known as a subvertical fault @entity103 faults are associated with just five per cent of @entity51 ’s seismic activity , but 97 per cent of documented cases of earthquake lights			1
geologist @entity106 of the @entity107 in @entity38 said : ' earthquake lights as a pre-earthquake phenomenon , in combination with other types of parameters that vary prior to seismic activity , may one day help forecast the approach of a major quake			0
scientists are still unsure why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults			2
however , they believe they can help warn of earthquakes in the future ' the numbers are striking and unexpected			0
we do n’t know quite yet why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults			0
' the earthquake lights described varied in shape and extent , though most commonly appeared as globular luminous masses , either stationary or moving , as atmospheric illuminations or as flame - like issuing from the ground			0
because they occur before or during the quakes it is suggested the processes responsible for earthquake lights formation are related to a rapid build - up of stress prior to fault rupture and rapid local stress changes during the propagation of the seismic waves			2
@entity90 rift environments now appear to be the common factor associated with earthquake lights			0
this image of an earthquake light was taken in @entity152 eyewitness reports and security cameras captured a large number of light flashes during the 2007 8.0 magnitude earthquake at @entity158 , @entity159			0
together with seismic records obtained on a local university campus , the automatic security camera records allow for an exact timing and location of light flashes that illuminated a large portion of the night sky			0
the light flashes identified as earthquake lights coincided with the passage of the seismic waves			2
the study was published in @entity173 .			0

these strange lights can appear before earthquakes but rarely afterwards
they often occur near rifts caused by movement in @entity51 *'s* *tectonic* *plates*
scientists believe the tension during this process *creates* an electronic charge , which turns into light when it reaches the surface
