‘ but you ca n’t ever say how high these increases will end up being			2
the one safe thing to say is that demand will out - strip supply			0
it is likely that food inflation will continue to rise for the foreseeable future			1
in some commodities , the increases will be massive			2
it ’s bread , vegetables , all produce			0
‘ the apple crop was down 20 to 30 per cent so apple prices have to go up			2
you have only seen the tip of the iceberg			1
it is impossible to say how long it will last			0
’ a car is towed from flood water in @entity65 , north @entity66 , in december the pain from last year ’s poor crops will be felt for the next two years , he added			2
while crops such as apples and vegetables will be felt immediately , meat prices take longer to be affected			0

’ painful reading : this graph shows how the rate of food inflation outstrips that of the shop price index ( @entity146 ) and non-food items the apple crop was down 20 to 30 per cent this year so the price is expected to go up the latest figures show average wages are just 1.8 per cent higher than a year ago – well below inflation of 2.7 per cent			1
inflation has been above the @entity154 ’s 2 per cent target for three years and continues to outstrip pay rises for the majority of workers while at the same time eroding the nest - eggs of savers reeling from record low interest rates			2
it was hoped that 2013 would finally see pay rise faster than prices – with average earnings going up 3.1 per cent and inflation falling to 1.9 per cent			2
but in the autumn statement last month , the @entity167 said it expected inflation of 2.5 per cent this year compared with wage growth of just 2.2 per cent .			1

recent increases ' just the tip of the iceberg , ' managing director @entity8
poor weather leaves farmers facing another poor harvest
