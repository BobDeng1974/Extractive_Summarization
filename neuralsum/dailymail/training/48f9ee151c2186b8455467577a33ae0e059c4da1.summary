by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:06 est , 3 february 2014 the @entity4 ’s former director general and two of his key lieutenants personally apologised for wasting £ 100million on a failed it project yesterday			1
in a grovelling appearance before the commons public accounts committee , @entity8 said sorry to mps and taxpayers for the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) fiasco ‘ that meant the loss of a lot of public money			1
’ he said : ‘ i just want to say sorry			2
i want to apologise to you and to the public for the failure of this project			2
but the triple apology was marred by the unrepentant stance of former @entity4 chief operating officer @entity38 , who was put in charge of @entity13 in april @entity40 only did she fail to apologise for wasting the money , she also refused to hand back a £ 680,000 severance payoff she was handed in 2012 – and boasted the huge windfall had enabled her to pursue her dreams as a ballet director			1
the closest miss @entity38 came to admitting responsibility was when she said she ‘ could have made a misjudgment ’ by failing to spot @entity13 was struggling in 2011 , although she did not accept this was definitely the case			1
refusing to hand back her severance money , she said she could ‘ understand ’ those who felt it was excessive , but insisted : ‘ i did a very big and responsible job			0
i could have earned a lot more if i had been working for @entity54 or in the commercial sector			0
’ damning : the @entity4 was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble , costing £ 98million sacked : @entity59 , pictured , whose £ 280,000 contract was terminated when the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) was launched in 2008 , it was hailed by @entity4 chiefs as ' the single most important initiative we are working on '			1
but before a year had elapsed , it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as ' do n't mention it			0
' the @entity4 originally appointed it firm @entity69 to implement the scheme			1
but it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in house			0
by then , £ 26million had already been wasted but it is understood the @entity4 later recouped the cost from @entity69			1
in february 2011 , the @entity76 condemned the corporation over its handling of the @entity13 after it ran 21 months behind schedule			1
the public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated			0
the @entity84 criticised the @entity4 for awarding the contract to @entity69 without putting it out to open tender			1
the project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material - for example last year 's @entity95 coverage - on their computers			2
as hundreds of staff moved to the corporation 's new headquarters in @entity100 , this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from @entity105 , reducing production costs			2
but the costs of the project continued to spiral to £ 98.4million until it was finally halted in may			0
asked why she had not in fact moved to @entity54 but instead became chief executive of @entity112 , miss @entity38 boasted : ‘ thanks to the payoff and the size of it i do n’t need to earn as much money as i used to			0
’ at the end of an occasionally acrimonious hearing – in which it emerged the @entity4 is still spending £ 3million a year on @entity13 – committee chairman @entity121 , said the failure was ‘ almost beyond parody ’			1
she added : ‘ i ’ve got to say , i hope to goodness this is the last hearing we have on a saga of this nature in relation to the @entity4			2
' i think there was a jungle of bureaucracy around at that time			0
rather sadly there were also some half - truths floating around the place			0
i think the @entity4 does deserve better			2
’ launched in 2008 , the @entity13 – jokingly referred to among staff as ‘ do n’t mention it ’ – was intended to digitise archives , enabling staff to share and download material remotely instead of using tapes			1
it was scrapped last may by present director general @entity141			0
but it has taken until now for those in charge at the time to admit responsibility			0
mr @entity8 – who became chief executive of the @entity146 after he left the @entity4 in 2012 – denied misleading mps when he told a hearing three years ago that @entity13 was working well			1
miss @entity149 – who earned £ 337,000 a year as the @entity4 ’s chief financial officer until last year – also apologised for failing to call a halt to the project earlier			2
she said : ‘ i took false optimism from my ability to correct things in the programme , and for that i apologise			0
’ mr @entity27 admitted the failure was ‘ significantly embarrassing ’ .			0

@entity13 ( @entity13 ) was supposed to give staff archive access
@entity76 says @entity4 was slow to act after it ran into trouble
