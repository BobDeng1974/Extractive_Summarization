by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:10 est , 26 february 2014 jobless @entity4 should be made to pick fruit on farms or face having their benefits taken away , the farming minister said yesterday			1
@entity9 insisted there would be no replacement for the @entity13 scheme that provided 22,000 foreigners a year with temporary permits to enter @entity4 to harvest crops			1
it was scrapped in september			2
instead , local unemployed people should be recruited to do the work , he said			2
@entity4 jobs : @entity9 was criticised for telling farmers @entity4 workers should take priority but the proposal has sparked fury among farmers - who say @entity4 jobseekers have a ‘ work ethic problem ’ which means people simply refuse to do hard manual labour			1
the farmers insisted yesterday that reliable foreign workers are vital for the industry and that foreign migrant labour has fulfilled their needs for generations			1
idle ? some farmers claimed workers from eastern @entity40 show more stamina ( file photo ) mr @entity9 told the @entity44 conference in @entity45 : ‘ i know that some people would say you wo n’t get them to do this work , they do n’t want to do it			1
' as a government we should n’t really tolerate that attitude that says we are going to pay people to stay on benefits because they do n’t want to do certain types of farming work			1
’ now farmers fear not being able to recruit enough staff to take in this year ’s harvest			2
some said @entity61 and @entity62 , who used to do much of @entity4 's harvest work , now prefer to work in factories , construction and catering because of their new employment rights			1
@entity44 president @entity68 accused the government of attempting a ‘ social engineering experiment ’			1
‘ just because the government says people should do farm work does n’t mean they are going to do it , ’ he said			2
hops and apple farmer @entity76 , who lives near @entity77 , said : ' we have a work ethic problem in this country ... every year we put out adverts and we try to recruit locally for the harvest			0
we are lucky if we get three replies for 50 jobs			0
‘ if you do manage to employ local people , by day five 70 to 80 per cent of them stop turning up			0
we have a huge dropout rate			0
‘ they ca n’t keep up with @entity91 workers and they drop out			2
‘ we need to ... go back to a position where anyone could come and work			0
‘ the benefit of the scheme was that they were guaranteed a job , they would come for a given period of time and they went home again			0
’ ‘ with the 2014 harvest this now means more expensive recruitment and much higher turnover of harvest staff , more costly training and more costly administration			0
hard work : at up to £ 8 an hour , fruit picking pays better than some jobs but has erratic hours and conditions ‘ it is a perfectly normal phenomenon that people from poorer countries travel to harvest richer countries ’ fruit and veg			0
it is a fact of life			0
it might not be a very nice fact of life but it happens all over the world , not just in the @entity4			1
’ mr @entity9 , who is @entity127 mp for the @entity129 constituency of @entity130 and @entity131 , said : ‘ we do n’t think it is acceptable that people who could work do not because they think there is something unglamorous about farm work			0
a government report last year said : ' @entity140 tried to recruit @entity4 workers but without success ' ‘ we are doing a number of things , including getting people who live locally to take some of these jobs , to make sure it ’s factored into the work that @entity149 is doing			1
‘ sometimes the barrier is that people feel it is not worth coming off benefits for a month or six weeks because they then have the difficulty of getting back on those benefits			0
that is something we are trying to address			0
’ mr @entity9 , whose family ran a strawberry farm in @entity129 in the 1990s , added : ‘ frankly , we need to try to make sure we make it easier for people who live locally who are on benefits but could work to take these jobs in agriculture			0
‘ i know , having worked in farming myself , how challenging that can be			0
’ migration watch @entity4 , which backed scrapping the scheme , said : ‘ it ’s hard to see why someone fit to work should not work on a farm , rather than just living on benefits			1
’ the government ’s independent @entity171 last year warned about the impact of scrapping seasonal work permits			2
in a report on the subject , it said : ‘ all the operators and growers we spoke to stated that they had tried to recruit , and retain , @entity4 workers but without success			1
the farms are not normally in high unemployment areas , @entity4 workers are reluctant to live on the farm and growers state that @entity4 workers either can not or will not work at the intensity required to earn the agricultural minimum wage			1
’ agricultural work pays slightly higher than other unskilled labour , at £ 7.50 to £ 8.00 an hour compared to the minimum wage of £ 6.31 , but workers are put off by the hard outdoor work and rural locations .			2

minister made claim at @entity44 conference in @entity45
but he was *attacked* by farmers who said @entity4 workers are too idle
@entity44 president : government is attempting a ' social engineering experiment '
