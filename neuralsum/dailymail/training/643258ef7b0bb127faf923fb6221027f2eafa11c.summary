by @entity0 behind the numerous benefits of self - driving cars , being touted by @entity4 and other manufacturers , an imminent danger is lurking			1
the technology could see criminals using the cars in high - speed chases , for example , or to shoot out of the window while the car drives itself			2
in fact , the @entity14 is so concerned about the threats they pose , the agency has dubbed them ‘ potential leathal weapons ’ in a recent report			1
the report said : ' @entity26 ... will open up ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today			1
' for example , criminals could shoot out of the window while the car drives itself the files were obtained by @entity35 at @entity36			1
@entity4 began by installing its self - driving technology to cars including the @entity39 and @entity40 in 2012			1
in may , the tech giant unveiled its own 25mph self - driving car , with a smiley face			1
@entity45 @entity44 has also announced plans to launch a range of autonomous cars by 2016			0
autonomous vehicles extend beyond cars , however , and also include the self - driving military trucks recently tested in @entity52			2
the demonstration was a joint project between the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and @entity57 in @entity58			0
called the @entity59 , the technology used in the trucks and @entity4 ’s cars included a high performance @entity64 sensor - or laser radar			2
they were revealed during a public records request , and detail the @entity14 ’s concerns about autonomous vehicles			1
it said : ' @entity26 … will make mobility more efficient , but will also open up greater possibilities for dual - use applications and ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today			1
’ the technology is currently only legal in four states , including @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , while @entity85 laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times			1
but @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic , and @entity95 is planning on passing a law before next year			0
these concerns extend beyond @entity4 ’s smart cars , too			0
autonomous vehicles referenced in the report also include the self - driving military trucks recently tested in @entity52			2
the demonstration was a joint project between the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and @entity57 in @entity58			0
each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections , oncoming traffic , stalled and passing vehicles , pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas			0
the technology includes a high performance lidar sensor , or laser radar			0
this remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead ( pictured ) and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser , and analysing the light reflected			0
the technology is also fitted with a gps receiver to plan , and track routes autonomous vehicles referenced in the report also include the self - driving military trucks ( pictured ) recently tested in @entity52			1

this remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser , and analysing the light that is reflected			0
the technology is also fitted with a gps receiver to plan , and track routes			0
the @entity14 report is n’t completely negative , though			0
it also claims law enforcement officers will be able to easily track the cars , and use algorithms to ‘ control the distance that the patrol car is behind the target ’ to avoid detection			1
according to the report , the autonomous cars could be approved for public use by @entity157 by 2020 .			0

files obtained by @entity36 detail @entity14 ’s concerns about self - driving cars
the report was revealed during a public records request
it said ‘ @entity26 … will open up ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today . ’
self - driving cars use radars and *cameras* to plot routes and avoid obstacles
the technology is only legal in four @entity182 states , while @entity85 laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times
