by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is likely to be thrust back into his role as stand - in manager at @entity4 this week when the players return to training on friday			1
with @entity4 manager @entity7 at the @entity8 and with @entity9 expected to progress against @entity10 through the second round , @entity1 could effectively be in control for the next two weeks			0
@entity15 â€™s new @entity4 assistants @entity13 and @entity16 , who is the goalkeeping coach , are part of his team with the @entity20 @entity19 , so it will be down to his remaining assistant @entity1 to set the tone for the new season			0
stand in : @entity1 will return to the managerial hotseat as @entity7 's @entity8 campaign continues adventure : @entity7 is still with @entity9 at the @entity8 and though @entity4 will probably prefer @entity15 to come into the job on the back of a successful @entity8 , it will create problems regarding any tactical changes he wishes to make , given that he might only return shortly before @entity4 set off on their @entity34 tour in late july			2
@entity35 , who will remain as under - 21 coach , will assist @entity1 but it is unclear whether @entity38 and @entity39 will be involved			1
@entity38 is likely to take an ambassadorial role and , while the club want to keep @entity39 in a coaching capacity , he will only stay if there is a clear role for him .			0

@entity1 will take charge at @entity4 when *pre-season* *begins* on friday
new manager @entity15 still with @entity9 at the @entity8
@entity35 to return as under - 21 coach but *futures* of @entity38 and @entity39 are yet to be *decided*
