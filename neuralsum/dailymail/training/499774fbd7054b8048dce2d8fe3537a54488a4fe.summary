photos submitted as entries to this year ’s @entity9 ’s @entity8 photography contest , now in its 39th year , show just what a transformation detail can make			1
the competition aims to put a spotlight on the magnificence of our natural world by showcasing stunning photography through the eye of a microscope			0
the @entity20 , a carnivorous plant , produces strap - like leaves that are up to 3.5 cm long and 0.5 cm wide			1
they are covered in brightly coloured tentacles ( pictured ) which secrete a sticky mucilage that traps insects this year ’s entries range from dew on a spider ’s web , to a close up of a soap bubble and a deep sea amphipod			1
a highlight is a microscopic view of the @entity20 leaf which is covered in brightly coloured tentacles			0
another image , taken by dr @entity37 from the @entity38 in @entity39 , highlights the explosive dynamics of sugar transport in fat cells			0
a photographer from the @entity44 , @entity43 , has captured a plankton organism at 250 times magnification using a technique known as differential interference contrast			0
this is an optical microscopy illumination technique used to enhance the contrast in unstained , transparent samples such as plankton a close up of a soap bubble taken by @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			2

darkfield microscopy , a method where the light source is blocked off causing light to scatter as it hits the specimen , was used to take an image of a @entity83 ( a single - celled organism ) at 20 times magnification			2
these tiny objects only show their true beauty under the microscope , when they come alive under huge magnifications			0
darkfield microscopy , a method where the light source is blocked off causing light to scatter as it hits the specimen , was used to take an image of a @entity83 ( a single - celled organism ) at 20 times magnification			2
these single - celled organisms consist of a bell - shaped head , and a stalk that is anchored to the substrate this image of dew on spider 's web was taken by mr @entity103 at @entity104 using five times magnification @entity105 was used to take this image of crystallisation of tartrazine - a dye primarily used as a food colouring			1
the image was taken by @entity111 at @entity112 , @entity113 at 40 times magnification this year 's contest drew entrants from a record 72 countries , as well as from a diverse range of academic and professional disciplines			1
contestants came from such fields as chemistry , biology , materials research , botany , and biotechnology			0
according to @entity9 , ‘ a good photomicrograph is also an image whose structure , colour , composition , and content is an object of beauty , open to several levels of comprehension and appreciation			2
’ the subject matter for this year 's contest was unrestricted and any type of light microscopy technique was acceptable			1
techniques could include phase contrast , polarised light , fluorescence , interference contrast , dark field , confocal and mixed techniques			1
the contest has been running since 1978 , and an archive of previous winners can be found here			0
results of the competition will be revealed by @entity9 on wednesday 30 october			1
this year 's contest drew entrants from a record 72 countries , as well as from a diverse range of academic and professional disciplines			1
@entity158 is a butterfly tongue photographed by @entity160 and @entity161 , @entity162 in @entity163 the subject matter for this year 's contest was unrestricted and any type of light microscopy technique was acceptable			1
this fish egg cluster was taken using stereomicroscopy at 6.6 times magnification these tiny objects only show their true beauty under the microscope , when they come alive under huge magnifications			0
mr @entity173 and @entity175 @entity174 , @entity176 took this image of a deep sea amphipod			0

the contest , now in its 39th year , was organised by @entity9 with results to be *announced* on wednesday 30th october
entries range from dew on a spider 's web , to a butterfly 's tongue and a close up of leaves on a carnivorous plant
techniques included phase contrast , polarised light , fluorescence , dark field and mixed microscopy
