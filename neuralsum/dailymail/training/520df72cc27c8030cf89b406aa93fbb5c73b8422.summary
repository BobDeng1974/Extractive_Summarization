@entity0 has confirmed @entity1 will stay as a striker for @entity3 , adding that it does n't matter where he plays for @entity6			1

but @entity3 boss @entity0 insists that as long as his and @entity6 's captain is playing well , then the position he 's playing in is largely irrelevant			2

' @entity28 coaches have different personnel - it does n't matter as long as he ’s playing well			0
' i know if we want him to move he can play like he does tonight ( monday ) , with enthusiasm and passion			0
' it 's incredible that he does so well so often in different positions			0
it ca n't be easy when a manager wants you to play in a position you do n't know well - but keeps doing so , i 'm pleased for him			0
' at the moment i 'd like to see him as a key figure for us as a centre forward and it would take a lot before i ’d start to think along those lines [ @entity1 as a midfielder ]			2
' he ’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer			0
it would take a lot from a 19 or 20 - year - old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps , there ’d be a lot of pressure			2
