by @entity0 @entity2 chief executive @entity1 believes @entity3 has taken a ' massive backward step ' after the @entity6 striker was handed another long ban for biting an opponent			1
@entity1 also feels the sanction handed down by @entity10 on thursday should have included a counselling and treatment course for the @entity14 striker to help him with ' a trait he has to get rid of '			1
@entity10 punished @entity3 with a nine - match suspension and a ban from playing for any team for four months after biting @entity20 defender @entity19 during tuesday 's @entity22 match			2
under the cosh : @entity3 , pictured in the hours before @entity10 's ruling , has been banned for four months @entity2 chief : @entity1 says that @entity3 is spoiling his talent and should be offered counselling to help him @entity28 down : it is the third time @entity3 has been banned for biting an opposition player it is the third time @entity3 has been punished for biting opponents , having been banned for seven matches while playing for @entity34 in 2010 and 10 matches when at @entity14 last year @entity1 told @entity36 : ' we felt things had got back on track ( following his ban with @entity14 ) , it was up there for everybody to see , but of course this is a massive backward step on the world stage			1
' i feel @entity10 should have led the way with regard to trying to make sure that this behaviour is just eradicated and insist on there being some serious counselling and treatment for @entity3 because there 's no doubt he 's one of the finest players in the world - but this is a trait he has to get rid of			1
' it 's just not good for him , for any of his club , his country or the game in general and i 've not seen that issue addressed either			0
' of course it 's not good when you 've got somebody of such talent who spoils that talent by such behaviour and that 's why i believe it needs looking at in a serious way and that treatment course needs to be part of any sanction i would suggest			0
' security : @entity6 's team hotel in @entity81 has been surrounded by armed guards in response to the incident @entity85 that ! @entity3 will not be able to play for @entity14 until the end of october decision maker : @entity88 said the incident ' could not be tolerated on any football pitch ' chomping at the bit : @entity3 appears bites @entity19 during @entity6 's 1 - 0 win on whether he thinks @entity14 will stick by @entity3 amid reports of interest from @entity97 giants @entity96 and @entity98 this summer , @entity1 added : ' they will have to make a decision			1
' the size of the ( reported ) fee ( from @entity96 and @entity98 ) is now a clear establishment for both the club and @entity3 , but no club wants to lose its very best players , particularly when they are one of the best in the world			0
' but on the other hand neither do you want a player who is going to be suspended if he 's got a trait in his character that ca n't be controlled			0
' ouch : @entity19 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity114 bite night ! @entity19 writhes on the floor after the clash with @entity3 not fooling anyone : @entity3 holds his teeth after appearing to sink them into the shoulder of the @entity121 @entity1 , though , pointed out that the @entity2 has been successful in helping players deal with problems regarding mental health , frustration and anger in the past			2
he added : ' i would suggest we 've been successful in about two out of three cases			0
so the odds would be in favour if that was addressed seriously , but of course @entity3 needs to accept that and be prepared to undertake that			0

@entity10 punishment should have included counselling
@entity3 ' had got back on track ' before incident
