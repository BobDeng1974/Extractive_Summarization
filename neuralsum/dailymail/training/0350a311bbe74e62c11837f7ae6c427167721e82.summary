@entity1 's official news service has launched a shocking volley of abuse at the outgoing @entity5 ambassador to @entity6 - labeling him a ' rotten banana ' and ' a guide dog to the blind '			1
the article - which also called @entity11 a plague - reflected @entity1 nationalists ' acute loathing toward the first @entity14 to have been @entity16 's top envoy to @entity6			1
the editorial ' @entity18 , @entity11 ' took direct aim at @entity11 's identity as a third - generation @entity14 , calling him a ' banana ' - a racial term for @entity23 identifying with @entity25 values despite their skin color			2
parting shot : @entity5 ambassador @entity11 speaks during a farewell press conference which provoked an extraordinary backlash from @entity1 's state mouthpiece newsagency ' but when a banana sits out for long , its yellow peels will always rot , not only revealing its white core but also turning into the stomach - churning color of black , ' read the editorial carried by @entity38			1
@entity11 provoked the anger of the state mouthpiece with comments in his final press conference on thursday			2
in it , the former commerce secretary and two - term governor of @entity45 , 63 , urged @entity6 to respect the rights of peaceful political activists			2
he said that @entity1 should value not just the economic welfare of its people , but also their freedom of speech , assembly and religion			0
insult : the startling editorial compared ambassador @entity56 with a rotten banana - an offensive racial slur ' we believe that freedom of expression is a universal right and we very much are concerned about the arrest and detentions of people who are engaged in peaceful advocacy , ' @entity11 , accompanied by his wife @entity58 , told journalists at the @entity68 in eastern @entity6			1
@entity11 also stressed the importance of making it easier for @entity1 tourists to get visas to visit the @entity5 he said : ' part of the reason for doing that is ... to enable more @entity1 people to experience @entity5 , to see first hand our freedoms , our democracy , our diversity ... i hope that perhaps from their experiences in the @entity5 they 'll want some of those same things in @entity1 or understand what is possible in @entity1			1
' but the comments seem to have struck a nerve with @entity1 officials			0
the editorial , under the byline @entity90 - likely a pseudonym - carried this morning , mocked @entity11 's portrayal as an official judicious with public funds			2
it criticized him for being hypocritical as he retreated into his multimillion - dollar official residence and special - made , bullet - proof luxury vehicle			0
farewell : @entity11 's used his final press conference to call for more @entity1 people to visit @entity5 and experience its ' democracy ' and ' diversity ' @entity90 belittled @entity11 's inability to speak his ancestral language and accused him of failing to understand @entity1 's law but fanning ' evil winds ' in the ethnically sensitive regions of @entity105 and @entity106			1
' not only did he run around by himself , he even served as a guide dog for the blind when he took in the so - called blind rights lawyer @entity110 and led him running , ' the editorial said			0
@entity110 later was allowed to leave @entity1 and now lives in the @entity5			2
the editorial made a malicious @entity1 curse at @entity11 , suggesting @entity11 's @entity1 ancestors would expel him from the family clan should they know his behaviors			1
@entity90 also made the innuendo that @entity11 should be blamed for the smog			0
' when he arrived , so did @entity6 's smog , ' @entity90 wrote			0
' with his departure , @entity6 's sky suddenly turned blue			0
' ' let 's bid goodbye to the smog , and let 's bid goodbye to the plague			0
farewell , @entity11 , ' ended the article , which was clearly inspired by @entity127 's 1949 piece , ' farewell , @entity128 , ' that scoffed at the last @entity5 ambassador under the collapsing @entity131 government in @entity132			1
tensions : relations between @entity5 and @entity1 reached a low following president @entity136 's meeting with @entity105 's spiritual leader the @entity137 in the @entity138 in 2010 the piece shocked members of the @entity1 public , who denounced the editorial as distasteful and offensive			1
but whether it would draw diplomatic protests was unclear ; attempts to contact officials at the @entity68 in @entity6 got no response friday			0
@entity11 's ethnic background particularly interested the @entity1 government and people			1
@entity11 won public applause when he was seen carrying his own bag and flying economy class but he drew criticism from @entity6 as his demeanor was an unwelcome contrast to @entity1 officials ' privileges and entitlements			1
in his three years in @entity6 , @entity11 oversaw the defusing of a number of delicate diplomatic episodes			2
@entity11 has been a critical player in soothing tensions between @entity5 and @entity1 which reached as low after president @entity136 met @entity105 's spiritual leader the @entity137 at the @entity138			1
he also led diplomatic efforts to seek a resolution when a powerful police chief fled to a @entity5 consulate and later when a persecuted blind activist sought shelter in the embassy			0
the @entity1 public also credit him with making them realize the harm of the tiny @entity175 and severity of @entity1 's foul air by posting the embassy 's hourly readings of air quality			1
meanwhile , the editorials in @entity1 state media turned from initial reservation to unfriendliness to the insolence of the final piece			0
danger : @entity11 is credited with highlighting the serious health problems caused by the little - known air pollutant @entity189 ' i think it shows the unfriendliness and impoliteness by the @entity1 government toward @entity11 , and it is without the manners and dignity of a major power , ' legal scholar @entity200 said			1
' it is unfitting of @entity1 's status as a diplomatic power			1
as a @entity1 , i am very angry and feel ashamed of it			0
' ' this article by @entity38 is the most shameless i have ever seen - not one of them but the most shameless , ' the popular online commentator @entity205 said			0
' without him , we probably still would not have known what @entity189 is , and how did he bring the smog ? you have played the snake in the @entity213			0
' another commentator @entity214 , known for his sharp tongue , said the piece is ungraceful			0
' when you call him a plague , you become a national shame as you lack diplomatic etiquette , damage the manner of a great power , and lose the face of all @entity1 , ' @entity214 wrote			2
@entity11 's replacement , former @entity225 sen. @entity224 , was sworn in last week and is expected to arrive within weeks .			0
