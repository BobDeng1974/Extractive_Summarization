@entity0 have under @entity1 developed a style more like " @entity3 " than the fabled " @entity4 " - which came to the fore in the seventies with @entity7 the inspiration			1
it ’s highly effective , with @entity0 having won all their group games and scored 10 goals			2
but @entity7 is critical and wants to see the @entity13 turn on the style against @entity15 and , ironically , be more @entity16 by turning their old power game into a more attractive style ' the @entity0 has qualified but the football is n't that good , ' the @entity13 legend said			1
high spirits : @entity0 manager @entity1 ( right ) and striker @entity23 seem happy with their approach and tactics as the team prepare to face @entity15 in the last - 16 of the @entity28 not impressed : but @entity13 legend @entity7 says the team should be playing more like @entity29 ' i liked the way that @entity29 kept playing in their own style – even during the moments when things were n't going well against @entity36			1
' that 's the way @entity0 should be playing as well			2
the results are good , now we have to start playing good football			0
' @entity15 will test just how good @entity0 ’s counter-attacking is , given that they have proved to have one of the toughest defences so far			1
along with @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity15 are the only team to have conceded just one goal			1
solid as a rock : @entity15 have conceded just one goal in the tournament so far and will offer stern opposition to @entity0 cult hero : @entity15 coach @entity54 is one of the most popular bosses at the @entity28 in @entity56 they have made 42 tackles compared to a tournament average of 36.7 and have achieved 121 recovered balls compared to 88.8			1
also , there have been nine offsides given in their favour against an average of 4.9			0
he is hardly the best known but @entity15 coach @entity54 has become a cult hero			2
his impassioned touchline antics , plus the generous was he treats fans , has seen him gather nearly 800,000 twitter followers ; easily the most of any coach at the @entity28			2
@entity73 @entity72 is @entity46 ’s coach , but just after @entity75 they had an @entity76 in charge			2
@entity78 , a @entity79 striker for @entity80 and @entity81 , managed several clubs in @entity83 – including @entity84 and @entity85 – and briefly took charge of @entity46 in 1946 oh and the last time they made the round of 16 on their @entity28 debut in 1990 , memorably beating @entity90 1 - 0 on their way to qualifying behind @entity56 in their group			1
but they were then beat 4 - 1 by @entity96			0
fine job : @entity46 's @entity73 coach @entity72 exceeded all expectations by guiding them through the group stage @entity102 is a familiar face after spending two years at @entity104 then six at @entity105			1
he will be the focal point of the @entity108 attack on sunday night and is the player @entity46 need to stop having ended a goal drought that lasted 1,478 minutes with his last minute penalty winner against the @entity112			2
now 29m his contract has expired with @entity105 and he could move back to the @entity114			1
@entity116 are also looking at him			0
centre of attention : @entity102 , seen here celebrating his winning penalty for @entity108 against @entity112 , is wanted by a number of @entity114 clubs after leaving @entity105 @entity123 - say @entity56 are still favourites to win the @entity28 but i say they are there for the taking when they face @entity130 in the quarter finals on friday			1
it was not a surprise they were taken all the way by @entity136 and only scrambled over the line on penalties on saturday			0
with the exception of @entity141 they have been distinctly lacking in @entity143 skills upfront and ironically for them have been indebted to a pretty tough defence			0
no mistake : @entity141 handled the pressure of the penalty shoot - out and sent @entity56 into the last eight at the expense of @entity136 off beat : @entity151 ( left ) has struggled to find his best form in the tournament so far as was again pretty ineffectual against @entity136 @entity154 and @entity151 do n’t seem up to it and @entity156 has n’t clicked			0
it ’s as if they have been carried through on the wave of emotion and support that surrounds			0
it could still see them through but @entity130 , familiar opponents in the @entity165 , wo n’t be fazed and with @entity167 up front could well deny @entity56 ’s dream of winning the @entity28 on home soil as @entity170 did in 1950			0
one to watch @entity171 is a modern - day @entity172 god			0
he was an inspiration when @entity108 won the 2004 euros and is still going strong at the age of 37			0
he will retire from international football after the tournament and is out of contract at @entity178			0
but in what is dubbed the clash of the underdogs he has still has the energy and passion to drive @entity108 who , like @entity46 , are seeking to reach the quarter - finals for the first time			1
@entity172 soldier : @entity188 will retire from international football at the @entity190 and is out of contract after leaving @entity178 @entity28 moment it ’s argued that @entity0 ’s 1974 were the best side never to win a @entity28			1
they could n’t have go off to a better start when @entity76 referee @entity197 awarded them a penalty in the first minute , which was converted , but @entity29 , led by @entity201 , bounced back to win 2 - 1			0
the @entity13 lost the 1978 final too but have so far showed they can at last be champions			0
@entity204 @entity0 to win and both teams to score is 4 - 1			2
the @entity13 to beat @entity15 3 - 1 is 18 - 1 @entity46 v @entity108 could be a slog so a draw at 90 minutes at 2 - 1 is prudent … 1 - 1 is is 11 - 2 and 2 - 2 is 20 - 1 .			1

@entity0 legend claims *van* @entity1 's side should play more like the @entity16
@entity0 went through @entity28 group stage with 100 per cent record and face @entity15 next in last - 16
@entity15 have one of the toughest defences at the tournament so far
@entity102 rest to lead @entity108 into battle against @entity46
