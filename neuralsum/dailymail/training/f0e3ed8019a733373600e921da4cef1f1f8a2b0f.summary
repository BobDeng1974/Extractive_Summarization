@entity0 gave their full backing to one - day captain @entity2 after he was caught up in a bizarre attempted blackmail plot over his personal life			1
@entity2 was due to lead @entity0 against @entity5 here at the @entity7 despite @entity8 becoming involved in a botched plan to demand £ 35,000 from @entity2 over a relationship he had with a @entity12 woman			1
the @entity13 are satisfied that @entity2 has done nothing wrong but the blackmail plot was an unexpected and unwelcome distraction for an @entity0 team who were looking to build on their comprehensive victory over @entity20 in @entity21			1
@entity0 's one - day captain @entity2 was the subject of a £ 35,000 blackmail plot the @entity13 received an email demanding money or details of @entity2 's past relationship would be revealed @entity2 is currently preparing his @entity0 team for friday 's @entity31 clash with @entity5 in @entity12 one of the more unexpected dramas involving an @entity0 cricketer emerged when the @entity13 attempted to defuse the potential embarrassment of the saga by going public on the details of the scam			1
the fiancé of a woman @entity2 had a relationship with five years ago , before he met his long - term @entity42 girlfriend @entity41 , sent two emails to the @entity13 threatening to release details of the fling unless he was paid £ 35,000			1
@entity46 said he would release ‘ sexually charged ’ messages and videos involving @entity2 and his now fiancé @entity49 , unless he was paid the money before the start of this morning ’s tri-series match here in @entity12			1
the @entity13 immediately told @entity8 about the plot and @entity56 detectives were able to track the man down within 24 hours			0
@entity46 then withdrew his threat , saying he was ‘ in a bad head space			2
’ @entity60 , @entity0 ’s managing director , was then forced to deal with the latest and perhaps most extraordinary drama of an eventful first year in the job which has seen him oversee the departures of @entity65 and @entity66 , the appointment of @entity68 and the sacking of @entity70 as one - day captain which led to @entity2 ’s appointment last month			2
the @entity0 captain spars with @entity75 at an @entity0 practice session in @entity21 last week the @entity13 confirmed no further action would be taken against @entity2 's would - be blackmailer ‘ there were references to a relationship @entity2 had five years ago with a single @entity42 lady , ’ said @entity60			2
‘ it was a brief relationship and this appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the @entity13			0
the man has now apologised saying he did not intend it to go this far			0
’ the @entity13 decided not to press charges against @entity46 and consider the matter closed but @entity2 will be very much under the spotlight in front of @entity42 crowds now			1
the @entity96 is a cool , calm character who keeps his private life very much to himself and takes satisfaction from the fact that not even many of his team - mates know much about him or even where he lives			0
there was no suggestion that he would miss the upcoming game and his failure to appear before the media on the eve of the game was hardly unusual as the one - day captain does not always give the pre and post match press conferences			0
he will shrug off any barracking he may receive			0
but @entity0 , who have had a traumatic year ever since they were thrashed 5 - 0 here in @entity5 during the last @entity117 , must wonder what on earth will come next as they attempt to have a more settled 2015 than last year			0
this is the most unlikely of distractions before a big match			0
@entity2 will lead @entity0 at the upcoming @entity123 in @entity5 and @entity124			2

@entity2 has been the subject of a failed blackmail plot
@entity46 said he would release sexual messages involving @entity2
@entity46 set demand of £ 35,000 before withdrawing his threat
