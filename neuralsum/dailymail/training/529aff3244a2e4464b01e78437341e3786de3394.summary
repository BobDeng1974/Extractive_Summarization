@entity9 , who was the party ’s powerful chief executive , now faces being questioned by detectives			1
@entity12 said interviews with alleged victims since the scandal broke in february justify a full probe			0
the peer is accused of behaving inappropriately towards a number of women in the party , but has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in further highly damaging developments for the @entity7 it emerged that : in his key party role , @entity9 presided over ‘ training ’ weekends attended by hundreds of female party hopefuls			1
some of them claimed he tried to entice them back to his bedroom and one threatened to blow the whistle at a tribunal before she was paid off by the party			2
others say they were left ‘ shamed and humiliated ’ during his alleged campaign of sexual harassment			0
one alleged he put his hands where they had ‘ no business being ’ and another branded him ‘ repugnant ’ for allegedly forcing his hand up her dress as they posed for a photo			0
alleged victim @entity47 has said she decided to go public because @entity9 appeared back on the scene the scandal erupted in february when two female party activists – @entity47 and @entity52 – spoke to @entity53			1
the @entity7 leadership was quickly accused of turning a ‘ blind eye ’			2
@entity12 officers initially worked to establish if the allegations against @entity9 could constitute criminal offences			1
as with other inquiries into ‘ historic ’ allegations , they contacted the potential victims and witnesses to see whether they would be willing to speak openly			1
last night , a police spokesman said they were ‘ carrying out inquiries to corroborate those allegations ’			2
detectives had asked the @entity7 to suspend their own inquiry into @entity9 and to hand them any information from a whistleblowing hotline			1
it is understood that a major trawl of emails and other documentation has taken place with a dossier of information handed to police			0
in an intriguing twist , potential victims and witnesses have been warned not to speak to the media as their actions may prejudice the inquiry			1
this suggests that detectives believe there is a possibility that a jury may eventually be asked to rule on criminal allegations against @entity9			1
the @entity7 leadership was quickly accused of turning a ¿ blind eye ¿ when party activist @entity52 spoke to @entity53 at least ten women are alleged to have made complaints that constitute evidence of criminal sexual assault			1
senior party figures face embarrassing questions about their own botched ‘ inquiry ’ into the allegations around five years ago			2
mr @entity101 , whose office asked two senior mps to look into the claims , is yet to explain fully what he knew and when			2
the deputy prime minister admits he knew of ‘ indirect and non-specific concerns ’ as early as 2008			2
his office asked mr @entity109 , his then chief of staff , to look into the claims			0
mr @entity109 spoke to the peer to warn him that any such behaviour was unacceptable			0
mr @entity101 ’s deputy chief of staff , @entity113 , also asked @entity114 , then party spokesman for women and equality , to carry out a probe			1
serious allegations : @entity9 presided over training weekend attended by party hopefuls she was asked to ‘ quietly interview ’ party workers making claims against @entity9			1
she did so , but no action was taken and she referred subsequent complaints back to @entity126 in mr @entity101 ’s office			1
miss @entity114 is also accused of telling a colleague that @entity9 had an issue with women but ‘ you just have to put up with it ’			0
former @entity7 chief whip @entity133 was also informed about the claims against @entity9 but did nothing			1
a year later , in 2009 , the peer stepped down as chief executive and took early retirement , ostensibly through ill health			0
when the furore broke , @entity139 called on mr @entity101 to ‘ get to the bottom of it ’			0
the @entity7 leader criticised the ‘ self - appointment detectives ’ of the press but was later forced to thank them for exposing the allegations			1
last night @entity148 , the @entity149 mp who first called for a police inquiry into the allegations , said mr @entity101 had questions to answer			1
‘ we need to leave the police to do their job , and i ’m sure all concerned will co-operate fully with the police inquiry , ’ he added			0
‘ clearly there will be questions to answer			0
the @entity157 have handled this very , very badly			0
‘ moving from no real inquiry at all , to a police inquiry is a big gulf , and it indicates that @entity165 processes are not robust enough and will need to be re-examined			0
this is more than embarrassment for @entity101 , it is a problem because they should have investigated the allegations properly			2
‘ he is the deputy prime minister			0
you ’ve got to run your own party properly and he clearly has n’t , or it would n’t have got to this stage			0
’ @entity9 ’s lawyers have insisted he ‘ always strived to conduct himself responsibly and appropriately at all times ’			2
he strenuously denies any wrongdoing			0
a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ there is no indication that the police want to speak to @entity101			1
‘ the police are continuing their ongoing investigation into allegations made against @entity9			1
‘ the party continues to liaise with the @entity185 , and has been since the allegations were first raised by @entity53 in february			0
the party encourages anyone with information they feel may assist the police with their inquiries to contact them			2
’ he said there was no indication police wanted to talk to senior party figures involved in the 2008 party investigation			0
a @entity185 spokesman said : ‘ as is standard in cases of an historic nature , officers ’ initial inquiries are made to establish if allegations of crime are being made and if there are potential victims and witnesses who are prepared to speak to police			1
‘ officers then carry out inquiries to corroborate those allegations , and in this case that process is on - going			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
