with his seat among the golfing gods already secured , you could forgive @entity4 for packing his clubs away for good			1
but when work consists of cruising on a yacht along the shoreline of a paradise island , stopping to hit a few balls into the crystal waters and admire the view , who needs retirement ? besides , @entity4 simply ca n't help but compete			2
above all , he still wants to win the one major he felt he was born to win			0
at @entity18 next april @entity17 will attempt to write himself into the history books and @entity20 will bid to have his picture printed on the front cover			2
but @entity4 yearns to beat them both , plus all of golf 's young guns , and win the masters at long last			1
the green jacket is his holy grail			0
' when i was young , i was very cocky and thought i was going to win all the majors by nomination , ' he says			2
' i thought the @entity26 was going to be the first one i ’d win and then @entity34 , and then the @entity36 and @entity35			1
well , i have n’t won the masters so far and i have n’t won the @entity38 @entity35 , so i ’m going to try to win the masters before i retire			1
this would possibly be my biggest career achievement			0
' @entity4 poses on board a yacht in the @entity44 , off the @entity46 island of @entity47 @entity4 hits balls into the ocean off the shore of @entity51 , where he has just redesigned a golf course @entity4 will be 45 when he next drives down @entity55 , so it is hard not to disagree with that sentiment			1
@entity58 remains the oldest masters winner , aged 46 in 1986			0
majors : 4 ( @entity36 - 1994 , 1997 ; @entity34 - 2002 , 2012 ) best finishes in other majors : masters : 2nd - 2000 , 2004 @entity38 pga championship : 3rd - 1995 , 2007 professional wins : 67 other : @entity67 champion @entity68 - 2011 @entity69 - 2003 , 2004 @entity70 - 1991 , 1995 @entity17 will be chasing a career grand slam in the majors and @entity20 's desire to overhaul @entity58 's record haul of 18 burns as brightly as ever , so @entity4 will have to do it the hard way			1
and that 's not to mention @entity81 's recent miracles at the @entity82			0
but @entity4 has beaten the odds before , most recently in pipping @entity84 at @entity34 in 2012			1
you could also say he has a score to settle			0
his @entity36 wins in 1994 and 1997 seemed to herald an era where he and @entity20 would share majors between them			1
but according to his former sports psychologist @entity92 , @entity4 developed ' @entity94 ' – a belief that @entity20 was unbeatable			1
to be fair his was n't the only mind troubled by that thought as @entity20 collected 14 majors in 11 years			2
asked who he considers his toughest opponent , @entity4 turns first to his old foe : ' back in the day , it was definitely @entity20 ; he was by far the best			1
' it was tough for me because i felt that i could really be the best player in the world and i was for a short time on paper , but @entity20 was really the man to beat			2
he was a very difficult competitor			0
the @entity109 shows off the stunning scenery , including a million - year - old rainforest @entity4 speaks at the opening of his course			1
his golf design business is flourishing alongside his playing career ' nowadays it ’s the game itself and the youngsters - @entity123 , @entity84 , we can go on and on ... @entity124			2
there are so many other really good players			0
' @entity4 fails to mention @entity17 but that is surely nothing more than an unintentional slip			2
where @entity4 was once denied majors by @entity20 he must now overcome the likes of the reigning @entity34 and @entity38 @entity35 to claim the four biggest prizes in the game			1
@entity4 admits that ' the wins are n’t coming as frequently as they used to ' - he has n't won a tournament since the @entity137 in june 2013 - but insisted ' i really enjoy my game and my time out there '			1
@entity4 is addicted to winning			2
no matter how many time he is knocked down by @entity20 , @entity141 and the rest , he ca n't help but haul himself back off the canvas for another pop at the champ			2
@entity4 celebrates the fourth major win of his career after @entity34 at @entity148 in 2012 @entity4 beat @entity149 among others to win the @entity36 for a second time at @entity152 in 1997 ' any time you lift a trophy it ’s a wonderful and memorable moment , ' he admits			1
' the joy is indescribable			0
i love doing anything if its competition , if it 's table tennis or tennis against my daughter , whoever , even a pool game , anything			0
competition is what it ’s all about			0
i ’ve been competing since i was 10 years old in a lot of different sports , it ’s in my blood			0
i ’m still trying , i want to try and win one or two more majors before i ’m totally done			0
' while the fires of ambition still crackle inside @entity4 , it will not be too many years before he is forced to rage against the dying of his golfing light			1
for now , however , there is too much still to achieve ; most importantly , that green jacket has never been draped over the giant shoulders of the @entity185			0
the @entity109 admits he enjoys taking on golf 's brightest young players , like @entity189 ( left ) @entity20 is the fiercest competitor @entity4 has ever faced and prevented him from winning more majors @entity4 admits his one major ambition still remaining is to win the masters at @entity18 before he retires off the course , his golf course design business is flourishing following the high - profile and controversial remodelling of @entity199 's iconic @entity198			1
it requires him to travel the globe to work on stunning projects , such as the one that sees him soaking up the sun on this yacht in @entity46			0
the @entity208 is built amid a million - year - old rainforest on the island of @entity211 in the @entity44 sea			1
nice work if you can get it			0
but it does n't satisfy that yearning for competition			0
@entity4 once told the world he was ready to retire to the @entity220 after he 'd won a major , but the bar flies of @entity222 and @entity223 are yet to hover around any watering hole of his			1
' i said that back in the early 90s			0
the media asked me " what will happen if you win this @entity36 ? " i said : “ well , i ’d just take the money and go to the @entity220 , open a bar and that would be that "			2
well , that was 21 years ago and i am still trying to win more tournaments , as well as building golf courses all over the world , so i guess that bar is gon na have to wait			0

@entity4 says his remaining ambition is to win the masters
the 45 - year - old @entity109 has won the @entity34 and @entity36 twice each
@entity4 rates @entity20 as his toughest ever competitor
but @entity4 now lists golf 's young players as his fiercest rivals
