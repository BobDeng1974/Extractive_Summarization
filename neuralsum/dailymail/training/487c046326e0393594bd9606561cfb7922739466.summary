by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:08 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 28 august 2013 when banker @entity3 was diagnosed with cancer and given only eight weeks to live , he started to think of ways to leave his mark			1
in the end he said it with flowers – one million of them to be precise – leaving them to the seaside town he had fallen in love with			2
shortly before his death , mr @entity3 , 69 , a @entity15 citizen , took the astonishingly generous decision to change his will and leave his £ 2.3million fortune to @entity20 in @entity21			1
improvement : @entity20 in @entity21 has received £ 2.3million to help beautify the seaside town planting : one million flower bulbs are set to be planted throughout the town thanks to @entity3 generous : the banker left £ 2.3million to the town in his will when he died in december 2007 his one condition was that the money should be spent on keeping the town ‘ beautiful ’ , and he suggested residents should embark on a project to plant one million bulbs			1
now mr @entity3 ’s dying wish is about to become reality as the community prepares to plant 153,000 flowers – or nearly ten for each of the town ’s 17,000 residents – in the first phase of a massive operation			1
mr @entity3 was born in nearby @entity42			2
he became an @entity44 pilot , but in 1976 moved to @entity15 where he worked as an investment banker			2
he would regularly return for holidays in @entity20 , where his mother retired , describing it as the picture - perfect @entity50 resort			1
scenic : parks , gardens and verges are all benefiting from the work funded by mr @entity3 's bequest bulbs : officials have now started the work of planting a million flowers as mr @entity3 suggested project : staff at the @entity63 have been stockpiling a huge number of bulbs he even became a member of the @entity67 and supporter of the @entity69 , @entity70 ’s oldest civic society founded in 1846			1
then on a trip to the @entity70 in 2007 , he was given the devastating news he had lung cancer			0
he urgently gathered civic leaders to discuss the gift before changing his will			0
mr @entity3 , who was divorced with no children , left £ 1.5million in cash and £ 800,000 in property to the @entity69 after his death in early 2008			0
the will stated that the capital should remain untouched but each year the estimated £ 120,000 interest should be spent on sprucing up @entity20 and the nearby villages of @entity85 and @entity86			0
beloved : mr @entity3 's mother lived in @entity20 and he loved spending his holidays in the town devoted : the money to plant flowers and carry out other projects came from a portfolio of investments and property around £ 400,000 of mr @entity3 ’s money has already been spent on youth projects , including a new scout hut			1
now volunteers are getting ready to complete the first phase of the planting project , sowing £ 166,000 worth of daffodils , snowdrops , crocuses and other bulbs			1
the 153,000 flowers will be planted during a special community day in two months ’ time , with @entity63 stockpiling the bulbs in preparation			0
@entity110 , chairman of the @entity69 , said : ‘ @entity3 spoke in detail about the kind of things he wanted the money spent on			2
on one occasion he said , “ think of things that will get everyone together – i do n’t know , plant a million bulbs ”			0
‘ so we ’re going to do exactly that			0
we will be planting the bulbs at over 50 sites – roadsides , park land and public gardens			0
‘ we can then sit back and , in spring , see what has sprung			0
’ picturesque : @entity20 attracts more than 100,000 visitors each year to its scenic beaches pretty : the town 's @entity136 architecture has been a draw for visitors for decades			2

@entity3 lived in @entity15 but used to visit mother in @entity20 , @entity21
when he died in 2007 he amended his will to leave all his money to town
