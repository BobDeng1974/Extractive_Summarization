by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:52 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 4 february 2013 admission : asked if his wife @entity3 said : ' occasionally , but i would complain so much that she would n't bother ' the former boss of @entity9 revealed yesterday his loyalty to the supermarket giant reached such a high level that he tried to ban his wife from shopping at rivals such as @entity5			1
sir @entity6 , who stepped down last year after turning the company into @entity17 ’s biggest and richest retailer , revealed he would deliver a ‘ severe telling off ’ every time he found products from the rival store in the family ’s fridge			1
the 56 - year - old even bribed his children to inform on their mother , a doctor in the @entity27 , if she ever shopped at the rival chain			2
asked if his wife @entity3 had ever shopped at @entity5 , the @entity30 - born businessman said : ' occasionally , but i would complain so much that she would n’t bother '			2
he added : ' i actually bribed my children to sort of inform on @entity3 if ever she popped into @entity5 when she picked up the kids from school			0
’ sir @entity6 and his wife , who have three children , live in @entity37 , @entity38 , which is close to the @entity9 headquarters			1
the nearest @entity5 is less than six miles away in @entity40 , north @entity41			0
@entity5 has made an aggressive attempt to attract @entity9 shoppers in recent years with a scheme promising to match its prices on big brand products			0
meanwhile he described the decline of high streets - with thousands of closed and empty shops - as ‘ part of progress ’			2
sir @entity6 said it was a natural result of families choosing to use supermarkets			1
historic no more : sir @entity6 has suggested that high streets are no longer fit for modern families whose shopping habits have evolved as families were choosing to use supermarkets the retail guru , who has advised successive prime ministers , suggested some high streets have effectively become irrelevant , historic relics			1
however , critics suggest the change in character of @entity17 , with the emergence ‘ ghost towns ’ , also has a great deal to do with @entity9 ’s financial and political muscle			1
in some cases it has used its enormous financial and legal resources to push through planning applications for new stores regardless of the views of local people and councils			0
such is its dominance , that it has effectively taken over many areas , claiming more than 50per cent of all grocery sales in so - called ‘ @entity81 ’			0
while the giant , with profits of more than £ 3billion a year , has also created a vast land bank , wrapped in legal covenants , that has prevented rivals from opening competing outlets nearby			2
the big supermarkets have also used staple products like bread and milk as loss leaders to attract customers away from small rivals			0
sir @entity6 was speaking on @entity96 ’s @entity95 yesterday , where he insisted shoppers , rather than supermarkets , were responsible for the changes seen in towns			1
dominance : critics suggest @entity9 's political and financial muscle can be blamed for the emergence of ' ghost towns ' where independent retailers used to thrive asked by @entity108 whether seeing boarded - up shops made him sad , sir @entity6 said : ‘ it does but it is part of progress			1
people are not made to shop in supermarkets , they choose to shop there			0
‘ high streets - some of them are medieval and the way that we live our lives now is very different , so what you have to do is make sure the benefits do outweigh the costs , and i think that they do			2
’ the @entity124 has fought to protect independent small stores – often unsuccessfully			0
' i actually bribed my children to sort of inform on my wife @entity3 if ever she popped into @entity5 when she picked up the kids from school ' sir @entity6 its chief executive , @entity131 , said : ‘ modern high streets are vital to the future of retail			1
‘ few would agree that the @entity9 towns that emerged under @entity6 ’s tenure constitute progress			2
‘ people still value their local shops and town centres , and government needs to do more to support these businesses			0
’ during the programme , sir @entity6 also revealed an unlikely connection with punk rockers @entity146 - telling how he lived in a flat above theirs and once kept them awake by listening to his radio too loudly			1
he said : ‘ i came down to @entity41 round about 1980 and it was just at the time of punk music and new wave music , and i got an attic flat in @entity41 above a punk rock band called the @entity146			0
‘ they used to play their music every day to four in the morning and i would be rocked to sleep by the @entity146 , and then i was up one morning with the @entity159 on my transistor radio and there was a bang on the door and it was a man in a leopard skin leotard and he said ‘ will you turn that radio down ? i ’m trying to get some sleep ’			0

sir @entity6 also says high streets are no longer fit for modern families
but critics say supermarket giant can be blamed for creating ' ghost towns '
he stepped down last year after turning firm into @entity17 's biggest retailer
