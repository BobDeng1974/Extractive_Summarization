more than half of families receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes , new figures showed today			1
new research reveals how the welfare system dramatically narrows the gap between the richest and poorest			0
however , income inequality has risen sharply after falling to its lowest level for more than 25 years			1
overall 13.8million households , 52 per cent of the total , received more in benefits and services than they paid in taxes in 2012 - 13 , the @entity10 said			1
as well as state benefits paid direct to claimants , it includes services such as education and healthcare			2
the figure is unchanged year - on - year and is down 1.8 per cent since 2011 but is still 8.2 percentage points higher than in 2000			0
@entity24 , director of the @entity25 , said : ‘ this small fall in the proportion of households who receive more in benefits than they pay in tax is welcome			1
‘ but the fact that over half of all households receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes should be deeply shocking			1
‘ there is still so much more to do to get us back to the long term average of around 45 per cent			0
’ analysis of the effects of tax and benefits shows how the state redistributes wealth each year			0
the wealthiest households earn 15 times more than those on the lowest incomes , but after paying tax and receiving benefits the difference is reduced to just four times			2
before taxes and benefits the richest fifth of households had an average income of £ 81,300 compared to just £ 5,500 for the poorest fifth of families			1
‘ overall , taxes and benefits lead to income being shared more equally between households , ’ the @entity10 said			1
‘ after all taxes and benefits are taken into account the ratio between the average incomes of the top and the bottom fifth of households ( £ 59,900 and £ 15,600 per year respectively ) is reduced to four - to - one			2
’ on average , families paid £ 7,400 per year in direct taxes , equivalent to 19 per of their gross income			2
the richest fifth of families paid on average £ 20,300 per year in direct taxes , the vast majority of which was @entity77			2
‘ this corresponds to 24 per cent of their gross income , broadly unchanged from other recent years , ’ the @entity10 added			1
cash benefits made up 56.4 per cent of the income of the poorest fifth of households ( £ 7,200 ) , compared with 3.2 per cent ( £ 2,700 ) of the income of richest fifth however , the figures also showed disposable income increased by £ 940 for the richest fifth of households while it fell for all other families , including a £ 381 drop for the poorest			1
@entity94 general secretary @entity93 said : ‘ the gap between rich and poor is growing again after a brief post-crash pause			0
last year the richest households got richer , while everyone else got poorer			0
‘ this is further proof that most people are failing to have a fair share in the benefits of recovery			0
‘ the return of rising inequality should worry everyone as it suggests that nothing has been learned from the financial crisis despite the huge fall in living standards that so many people are still experiencing			0
’ as a result there was a slight increase in income inequality between 2011/12 and 2012/13 , based on the gini coefficient measure			1
the number can vary between 0 and 100 and the lower the value , the more equally household income is distributed			0
the @entity121 for the disposable income of all families was 33.2 per cent , up from 32.3 per cent in 2011 - 12 - the lowest figure since 1987 .			0
