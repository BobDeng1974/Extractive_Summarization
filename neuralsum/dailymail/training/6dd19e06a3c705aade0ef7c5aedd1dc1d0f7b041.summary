a sister of @entity2 bombing suspect @entity1 pleaded guilty tuesday to misleading a police detective during a counterfeiting investigation , avoiding jail time in an agreement with prosecutors			0
@entity8 , 24 , entered the plea in @entity10			1

prosecutors said @entity8 failed to cooperate with a police officer investigating the passing of a counterfeit bill by a group of people eating at an @entity23 's restaurant in the @entity24 , a mall in @entity27 's @entity26 neighborhood , on april 16 , 2010			2

in court tuesday , @entity8 's lawyer , @entity47 , acknowledged that @entity8 had misled police but said her motivation was to protect a female friend , not the person who allegedly passed the counterfeit bill			1

' the most effective way of handling this and not interfering with her other pending case is to place this conviction on file , which allows the judge to re-sentence her if she re-offends at any time during the next 30 days and also prevents any appellate challenges to the conviction , ' @entity68 said			1
