as any music fan knows , stuffing headphones into a bag causes them to become tangled , or damaged			2
the @entity4 attempts to solve this problem by storing the headphones inside a phone case fitted with a ‘ winder			2
’ this means the headphones are protected , but they can also be extended or retracted easily , by spinning a handle on the back			2

inspired by headphones constantly getting tangled in a bag , ( pictured ) experts from the @entity126 , recently investigated the probability of knotting , the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study inspired by headphones constantly getting tangled in a bag , experts from the @entity126 , recently investigated the probability of knotting , the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study			0
@entity139 and @entity140 confirmed that ‘ complex knots often form within seconds ’ and that stiffer wires are slightly less likely to form such mind - boggling tangles			0
when shaken up , the wires form coils and the loose end weaves though the other strands , creating the annoying knots			0
professor @entity150 from @entity151 then set out to investigate this so - called ‘ @entity152 of string ’			0
@entity152 is an adage that basically means anything that can go wrong , will go wrong			0
similarly , @entity150 said that any string that can get into knots , will do			0
building on earlier mathematical research , he concluded that string - and headphones - really does have a perverse tendency to knot spontaneously			0
he also found the longer the string is , the more likely it is to spontaneously knot			0
joining the ends together dramatically reduces the probability of the string performing the manoeuvres needed to form knots , making tangling less likely , something he calls the @entity170 .			0

the @entity4 is available for the @entity33 , @entity34 and 6
it is only currently compatible with @entity42 ’s proprietary headphones
