a @entity1 pastry chef has come up with the next calorie - laden bakery must - have : the crookie			1
the cookie - croissant mix is made by stuffing croissant dough with crushed @entity6 and icing sugar , then baking it with half an @entity6 placed on top			1
the sweet invention , born in the ovens of @entity12 's @entity11 , materialises into a delicious - looking cake , flaky and gooey all at once			2
@entity14 's decided to attempt integrating oreos with universally loved croissants ' when you bite in , it 's creamy and sweet , with the cream wrapping itself in the croissant dough and a crunchiness from the @entity6 bits , ' says @entity11 owner and baker @entity23 according to @entity25			2
@entity12 - based publication @entity26 to challenged @entity23 to create a new dessert using two classic but different ingredients			2
oreos became @entity31 - born @entity14 's favorite cookie when he arrived in @entity1 many years ago , and so he decided to attempt integrating them with universally loved croissants			1
it took several tries to get the shape correct so that the oozy @entity6 cream stayed within the flaky pastry layers			0
the hybrid is made by stuffing croissant dough with crushed @entity6 and icing sugar and now @entity1 customers are ordering the perfected dessert by the half - dozen , and @entity23 says the looks forward to ramping up production to keep up with increasing demand			1
if they start making them in the @entity48 , the crookie poses a viable alternative for office workers who do n't have half an hour to spend queuing up for a trendy cronut - the famous croissant - donut hybrid			1
@entity55 bakery @entity53 invented the cronut - half croissant , half donut - in may and now attracts huge queues to form outside its premises , selling out within an hour			1
the cronut , which has already received interest from curious pastry chefs in @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 , is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried , rolled in rose sugar , and then filled with light tahitian vanilla cream			0
rose - flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer , which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake ; finally , crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish			0
' a cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough , ' said the chef			0
' we actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant '			0
the cronut quietly unveiled by @entity86 's @entity53 now sells 200 an hour			0
