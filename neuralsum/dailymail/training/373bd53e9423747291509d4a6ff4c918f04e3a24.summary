with the polls already open in some battleground states , and just seven days left on the calendar until @entity1 , a new survey shows that @entity5 remain unhappy with the @entity7 president and the direction he is taking the country in			1
in the latest @entity12 / @entity11 poll @entity5 again gave @entity13 an approval rating , and seven in 10 said they believe the country is on the wrong track			2
one of the only positive nuggets of news for the president and his party in the new survey is that half of @entity5 said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president			1
that bodes well for embattled @entity7 whose @entity30 challengers have promoted their candidacies as referendum on the sinking president			1
upside for @entity7 : half of @entity5 said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president just seven in 10 @entity5 say they believe the country is on the wrong track - that does n't bode well for @entity7 competing in next tuesday 's midterm elections still , twice as many respondents , 31 percent , said their vote would be to show opposition to @entity13 than those who said it would be to make a statement of support , 16 percent			1
and 63 percent say the government 's ability to deal with the nation 's problems has gotten worse			0
@entity5 who feel that way favor republicans to come in and save the day by nearly a three to one margin			1
democrats hoping for an @entity56 or some other @entity57 are unlikely to get one at this point in race			0
with just a week left to go until @entity1 , it 's all about turnout now			2
@entity12 ' survey shows that even though voters expect @entity30 to take control of @entity66 , @entity7 still have a shot if they can turn out their supporters to the polls			1
among likely voters , the @entity30 has a six - point advantage going into next tuesday 's elections			0
but when all registered voters are taken into account , it 's democrats who have the edge			0
registered voters said they prefer the @entity7 candidate in their congressional district to @entity30 one , 47 - 44 that 's compared to likely voters , who said they plan to cast a ballot for the @entity30 candidate next week by a margin of 50 - 44			2
not helpful : @entity13 's underwater approval rating may also hurt @entity7 candidates at the polls next week whether or not @entity7 will be able to mobilize their supporters in the next several days is make or break for the party , which is in danger of losing nine @entity92 seats currently held by @entity7 to the @entity30			1
if endangered @entity30 are able to fend off their @entity7 challengers in three key states and the party as a whole is able to pick off three additional @entity7 , that 's the ball game for the president 's party during his final two years in office			2
@entity13 's only means of recourse will be to use his vaunted pen and phone to issue vetoes of @entity30 - passed legislation			0
while a @entity30 - controlled legislative branch would theoretically be game changer for federal policymaking , a large segment of likely voters , 31 percent , believe the change - up will make no difference			0
another 28 percent of the survey - takers told @entity12 and @entity11 's pollsters they think @entity30 leadership of the @entity92 will be bad for the country			0
a plurality , 39 percent , said they thought the @entity30 would do a good job .			0

@entity1 is around the *corner* and a new survey shows that @entity5 remain unhappy with the @entity7 president
@entity5 who think the government is doing a bad job favor republicans to come in and save the day by nearly a three to one margin
@entity7 still have a shot at winning the midterm elections if they turn out their supporters to the polls in *droves*
