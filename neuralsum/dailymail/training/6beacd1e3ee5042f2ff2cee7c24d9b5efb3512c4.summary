by @entity1 reporter published : 00:33 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 25 june 2012 @entity2 can glide through the water like a graceful water baby - but may never be able to say her own name or even walk			0
the brave 20 - month - old suffers from a condition which doctors do not know the cause of and have struggled to find a cure for			1
@entity12 , from @entity13 , has swan - syndrome without a name - meaning medics have told her devastated parents she may never walk or be able to hold a conversation			1
water baby : @entity12 was born with an under - developed brain , but does not let that stop her from making a splash in the pool making waves : @entity12 may never be able to walk or hold a conversation , but still likes to paddle through the water with the help of mum @entity27 sibling love : @entity12 's sister @entity30 , five , has a quiet moment with her sibling , while right , the @entity2 family are pictured together the debilitating genetic condition means children often require round - the - clock care from their parents , and sees those who suffer from it miss developmental milestones as they grow up			1
but while little @entity12 may never walk or talk , her mother @entity27 says she is as confident as any other child her age once takes to the water			1
the youngster happily swims about under the watchful eye of her parents , despite the hardships she faces in every other aspect of her life			1
@entity27 and her 34 - year - old husband @entity50 noticed their second daughter was n't developing at the same rate as their other girl , @entity30 , now five , when she was just four - months - old			2
@entity27 , an admin manager , told @entity56 : ' we ’ve been told by doctors she may never walk or talk			2
' it ’s so heartbreaking to see friends ’ children reaching their milestones and thinking , sadly , ‘ she may never be able to do that			2
’ @entity27 and @entity50 , right , admit they are sometimes ' terrified ' about what the future holds for their daughter happy : @entity27 said her youngest daughter still smiles and is affectionate despite her condition ' yet in the water , there ’s no difference between @entity12 and any other child			1
in fact , she ’s much more confident and happy swimming about			0
' swimming has been our saviour – to see her so serene and happy when otherwise life is so hard			0
' @entity27 said she struggled to get @entity12 to eat or drink , and was initially told it could be a reflux - where babies are sick automatically after eating			1
but when the symptoms continued and @entity27 was unable to breastfeed her daughter , doctors were at a loss to explain what was wrong with the youngster			1
eventual mri scans and further tests showed @entity12 had been born with an under - developed brain , leading doctors to diagnose her with @entity91			1
the devastation diagnosis often leaves parents feeling as they have no idea what to expect from their child			2
there are thought to be around 6,000 disabled @entity99 children born every year who are born as ' swan babies '			1
babies have problems with feeding and gaining weight			0
they may have significant learning difficulties , facial features such as low - set ears , heart conditions , vision problems and epilepsy			0
fearless swimmer : @entity27 says her daughter is ' serene and happy ' in the water despite her condition problems vary enormously from child to child , and @entity118 is not an illness in its own right			2
experts believe these conditions are genetic			0
but each case is thought to be the only one of its kind , which makes a proper diagnosis – and prognosis – incredibly difficult			0
each parent will have been given the same utterly frustrating news by doctors : there is no way of knowing what the future may hold for their child			1
treatment is a matter of fire - fighting , tackling problems as they arise			0
it is impossible to pre-empt difficulties because there are no previous cases to reference			0
to @entity27 's delight , @entity12 began to crawl a few weeks ago , although both parents realise she does not talk , may not be able to hear , and does not respond to her own name			1
@entity27 said both her and husband @entity50 have at times been ' upset ' by the condition , admitting they are ' terrified about the future ' and whether @entity12 will survive			1
the brave little girl struggles with many things in life , but her mother has taken heart from the manner in which she dos n't appear daunted by water			0
@entity27 told @entity56 : ' the future is such a big unknown , yet swimming is the one thing @entity12 can do better than any other child in her @entity166 class			1
' i love to see her — and it gives us all so much hope			0
' while the search for a definitive diagnosis may sound irrelevant as swan children clearly have disabilities , the lack of a medical label makes their situations more difficult			2
not only are the families looking after children with extreme needs , they are also dealing with complicated bureaucracy to get help			2
‘ having a clear diagnosis assists patients to get access to help , ’ explains @entity184 , deputy director of the charity together for short lives			0
‘ ideally there would be a key worker for each family who assessed all their needs			0
in reality everything is disjointed			0
families have to repeat their stories over again to different doctors			2
' they need health , education and social care – which are represented by different departments of social services – as well as medical care			0

her parents admit they are ' terrified ' about not knowing @entity12 's future
