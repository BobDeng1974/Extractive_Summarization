by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:38 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:32 est , 20 december 2013 an ancient terracotta baby bottle shaped like a pig has been uncovered by @entity6 archaeologists			1
the vessel , which can also be used as a baby ’s rattle , is 2,400 years old and is thought to have belonged to a member of the @entity12 tribe who lived in the south of @entity6 at the time			2
the bottle , or ‘ guttus ’ has human - like eyes and terracotta balls in its stomach so it could become a rattle after a baby had finished drinking its meal from the quirky vessel			1
a 2,400 - year - old pig - shaped terracotta baby bottle , which can also be used as a rattle , has been uncovered by @entity6 archaeologists it was found in a @entity12 tomb in @entity29 , near @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity6 – a region that was inhabited by the @entity12 people in around 1,000 @entity33 – along with a number of other objects			1
the stone tomb , which measures eight by four square feet and is decorated with bands of blue , red and ochre , contained the remains of two people			0
the @entity12 typically buried family members together and there were also remains of a later burial in the same tomb			0
‘ we found some skeletal remains piled in an angle			0
other remains , related to a later burial , occupied the entire tomb , ’ @entity46 of the @entity47 of @entity31 told @entity48			2
the team of archaeologists found 30 objects in the tomb , including two terracotta figurines of females , three baby bottles , including the unusual pig - shaped one , as well as jars , vases , laps and plates , which have now been cleaned and restored			2
a black basin and iron knife suggest a male burial , while a traditional vase called a trozzella , suggests a female was also laid to rest in the tomb as the vase is often found in tombs of women at the time			0
the bottle , or ' guttus ' has human - like eyes and terracotta balls in its stomach so it could become a rattle after a baby had finished its meal , dispensed from the quirky vessel however , the presence of the baby bottles and the female figures suggests a newborn girl might have been buried there too , as the figures were often placed in the graves of young girls			1
archaeologist @entity92 told @entity48 : ‘ we might speculate that the female individual was pregnant at the time of death			0
’ he thinks it will be difficult to ascertain whether the bottle did belong to a baby , as it is probable that any baby ’s bones have completely decomposed			0
dr @entity46 said ‘ analysis of the funerary objects and their context suggest that the two burials followed one another in the @entity107 period , between the end of the fourth and the third - second centuries @entity33 ’ the bottle was found in a @entity12 tomb in @entity29 , near @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity6 - a region that was inhabited by the @entity12 people in around @entity111 - along with a number of other objects the team of archaeologists found 30 objects in the tomb , including two terracotta figurines of females , three baby bottles , including the unusual pig - shaped one , as well as jars , vases , laps and plates , which have now been cleaned and restored			1
