by @entity0 last updated at 7:07 am on 24th november 2011 as it turns out , @entity1 does n't have much to be thankful on the eve of @entity4 ... in regards to her show , @entity6 , that is			2
the 49 - year - old former choreographer 's entire category has been wiped out after tonight 's shocking double elimination			1
her one remaining group , @entity12 , was given the boot alongside @entity15 's contestant @entity14			1
double elimination : @entity12 have been eliminated from the competition bye bye @entity19 : the youngest - looking 60 - year - old on the planet was also sent home during tonight 's elimination not a happy camper : @entity1 's entire category was eliminated with @entity12 tonight the ladies - @entity27 , 18 , @entity28 , 17 , @entity29 , 17 , and @entity30 , 22 - sang @entity31 's @entity32 last night but received the overall lowest amount of votes			1
@entity36 's act , 14 - year - old @entity37 , was also pulled up alongside the girls but was quickly sent to safety			1
they appeared to have channelled @entity31 's graciousness as well , as they gracefully accepted defeat , saying : ' the dream is not over			0
you 'll be seeing @entity12 in concert everywhere			2
' @entity1 , though furious to be out of the running , will remain on the show as a judge and commentator though she is not personally invested in its outcome			0
the first elimination : @entity37 randomly found herself up for elimination against @entity12 say goodbye : @entity1 bids farewell to her final remaining group , @entity12 safety kisses : @entity36 kisses his contestant , @entity37 , as she 's saved from elimination the second elimination came after a sing - off between the second and third lowest vote - getters : @entity14 and @entity64			1
the @entity66 native , who dedicated last night 's performance of @entity69 's @entity68 to his mother , wowed the crowd by singing @entity73 's @entity72			0
60 - year - old @entity14 also dedicated his song , @entity76 's @entity75 , to his mother but failed to impress the judges with his version of @entity79			1
the x factor : @entity64 apparently has it , @entity14 did not as @entity81 decided who to keep around like a prayer : the former @entity85 seems to be praying that @entity14 wo n't be eliminated the ride is over : @entity15 says goodbye to her contestant , @entity14 the 20 - year - old 's mentor , @entity88 , staunchly stood by his contestant , saying : ' if we 're talking about a massive star , we 're talking about @entity64			1
' @entity14 's own mentor , former @entity92 , defended her contestant , saying : ' i know right now you 're singing for your life			2
i have to send home @entity64			0
' given that she had nothing to lose , @entity98 also chose to send @entity64 packing			0
she told the young singer that he was one of her ' favourites ' but that @entity105 ' really sang for his life '			0
still kicking : @entity36 's whole group , including @entity37 , @entity108 and @entity109 , are still competing safe ! @entity88 's group of @entity112 , @entity64 and @entity113 are moving on again in the competition with his vote as the deciding factor in a tie for @entity64 and @entity14 , @entity36 opted for the older contestant , bringing the vote to a deadlock			2
in a ' deadlock ' , @entity81 's votes determine the winner - and @entity81 determined that @entity14 should go home			2
like @entity12 , the @entity127 , @entity126 native bowed out with his head held high			0
stronger : former @entity130 champ @entity129 sang her new single , stronger soulful singer : @entity133 performed his new single from the twilight soundtrack , it will rain ' i 'm actually feeling ok , ' the teary - eyed singer claimed , before his mentor butt in to steal the show , as always			2
the 33 - year - old singer grabbed @entity14 's mic and yelled : ' he did amazing ! let 's hear it for @entity105 ! ' in between the glaring double elimination , viewers were treated to performances from @entity129 and @entity133			1
the former @entity130 champion sang her latest single , @entity131 , in front of gigantic cartoon fists			0
singing circus : the remaining nine contestants performed a medley of @entity155 songs 26 - year - old @entity133 sang his latest hit , it will rain , off the @entity158 : breaking @entity160 1 soundtrack			1
before the final elimination , all nine contestants performed a medley of @entity155 songs while dressed as circus performers			0
the remaining contestants now stand at seven - @entity166 , @entity37 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity167 , @entity113 and @entity112			0
@entity36 and @entity88 's entire categories remain intact			0
the judges table : @entity1 's category is done , but @entity15 , @entity36 and @entity88 are still around			1

@entity12 , @entity1 's final group , is eliminated
@entity15 loses oldest contestant , 60 - year - old @entity14
