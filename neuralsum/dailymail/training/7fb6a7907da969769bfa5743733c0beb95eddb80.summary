it was only on friday that @entity1 was mentioning @entity2 in the same breath as @entity4			1
' we 've got a top quality player of the highest calibre and he 's going to provide the sort of service our front line needs , ' the @entity6 manager gushed after happily making the @entity4 comparison			2
like pretty much everything else he 's done so far this season , @entity1 was right on the money			2
barely 24 hours later , @entity2 turned in a @entity18 performance against @entity4 as @entity6 preserved their place in the @entity21 places with a 2 - 1 win over @entity23			1
there were moments of brilliance , too			0
it was @entity2 who delivered the pass that unlocked the @entity23 defence and set @entity47 free in the build - up to their first goal , converted at close range by @entity52			1
and he even pulled out the most popular trick of the week - the ' @entity54 ' - to deliver a cross during the second - half			1
by contrast , @entity4 , as so often this season , simply was n't up for the battle			0
when @entity28 international song , 27 , was made available by @entity61 in the summer , @entity1 saw off competition from the likes of @entity64 and @entity65 to sign a player who had not been able to hold down a first - team place at the @entity68			1
@entity1 's team are on the top and currently occupy one of the @entity21 places song breaks up a @entity23 attack by lying on the ball as @entity76 tries to retrieve it song 's heap map from the @entity23 match shows just how much ground he covered in midfield but when @entity2 said shortly after his arrival that @entity6 could ' maybe catch the @entity85 positions , ' most mocked his ambition , especially following their troubles last season			1
he had just joined a new club and wanted to say the right things , they claimed			0
that aim is looking a whole lot more likely now as , following five wins from nine matches , the resurgent @entity6 are fourth in the @entity96 , a single point behind defending champions @entity23			1
@entity6 are a team transformed , the negative and conservative approach of the last few years replaced by something a little closer to their attacking tradition			0
if @entity2 has as much influence in and around the training ground as he does on matchday , then he has proved a shrewd acquisition			2
@entity1 said as much on friday : ' on the training ground he is a massive influence and in the changing room it 's his dress sense that 's the massive influence			2
song soaks up the acclaim of the @entity115 crowd after his man of the match performance song gets stuck in to @entity120 's @entity119 during @entity6 's 3 - 1 win over the @entity122 last month song takes on @entity125 's @entity124 during the 2 - 2 draw at the @entity127 ' i 've never seen so many hats in my life - or scarves that look like tea towels ! ' jokes about his fashion tastes aside , what a presence to have in the squad			1
a man who competed at the highest level for @entity141 and @entity61 , a @entity143 champion and a man with 47 caps for his country			0
@entity2 can only bring benefit			0
there are plenty of other clubs in the @entity96 - @entity141 included - who would have valued a song - like figure this season			0
the @entity154 are crying out for a defensive shield , while even @entity120 and @entity156 would have benefitted from such a grafter to protect the back line			0
just look at his statistics from saturday at @entity115 - he recovered possession on 11 occasions , stifling a potentially dangerous @entity23 move on each occasion			2
@entity165 continued his hot scoring streak with the goal that proved to be the winner at @entity115 his heat map shows @entity2 covered the full sweep of the midfield and he covered 10.7km during the course of his 90 minutes			0
@entity2 's efforts proved key and he was rightly selected as the man of the match			0
while the likes of @entity47 and @entity165 , again on target on saturday , may steal the headlines , @entity2 's influence at revitalised @entity6 must not be overlooked .			1

@entity2 was excellent as @entity6 beat @entity23 2 - 1 on saturday
the on - loan midfielder from @entity61 disrupted @entity23 's creativity
he started the move that led to @entity52 scoring their first
@entity2 even pulled off a ' @entity31 ' cross during the second - half
@entity1 has *praised* his influence on the pitch and behind the scenes
the @entity6 are flying high in fourth place in the @entity96
