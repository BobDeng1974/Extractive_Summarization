@entity6 ’s triumphalist chant of ‘ we ’re all right ’ at a @entity8 rally left him a laughing stock when he lost the @entity10 days later			2
fast forward 21 years and it seems he has n’t learnt his lesson			0
former @entity8 leader @entity6 's celebrations prompted him to be moved so he could sit with other @entity15 supporters , after his cheers annoyed home fans at @entity18 ( previous photos ) the former @entity8 leader was spotted at a @entity22 football match celebrating wildly when his beloved @entity15 scored first , 12 minutes into the game			1
unfortunately he was seated in the home stands of the rival team @entity25 , where his premature boasting was given short shrift			2
he was promptly escorted from his seat by stewards , along with two of his grandchildren who were with him , and moved to another part of the ground			0
lord @entity6 ’s exuberance provoked ‘ angry responses ’ from @entity25 fans for ‘ spoiling ’ their enjoyment of the game , according to an official for the home team			1
after the match , a @entity15 supporter wrote on the club ’s fan forum : ‘ pleased to see mr @entity6 sitting two rows in front of me			1
‘ i am not sure if @entity6 has as much experience as me of sitting with the home fans but his celebration of our first goal led to him being escorted from the stand			1
’ @entity15 , who @entity6 has supported since boyhood , won the game 2 - 1 @entity15 fans had been allocated seats in the home stands after their official allocation sold out			1
@entity62 resident @entity6 was later spotted going ‘ bonkers ’ in another part of the @entity18 ground when @entity15 scored in injury time , handing them a 2 - 1 victory			1
it was newly - promoted @entity15 ’s first away win in the top flight since 1962 , when @entity6 was a student in @entity71			1
‘ i do n’t think i went wild but i did express great joy , standing up , there ’s no doubt at all about that			0
' lord @entity6 yesterday @entity76 , from @entity25 , said : ‘ mr @entity6 was located in the home stand on saturday and caused some angry responses when he and his family celebrated the @entity15 goal			1
‘ he was relocated in the @entity82 end – the away stand – where there were a number of spare seats			0
‘ mr @entity6 was asked very politely by one of the stewards if he would like to sit with the away fans			2
we would do that with any fan who celebrates a goal because the home area is for home fans			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity8 peer claimed it was just a coincidence that he was moved			2
but lord @entity6 later confessed : ‘ i did n’t give it a second thought , sitting in the front row by the corner flag and everybody was very pleasant			2
‘ then in the 12th minute i did what i ’ve done for 65 years of supporting the city and leapt up , and so did the kids			0
’ speaking to @entity71 , he continued : ‘ i do n’t think i went wild but i did express great joy , standing up , there ’s no doubt at all about that			0
‘ within a minute or so the @entity25 stewards , who were a model of courtesy , said , “ mr @entity6 we think you might be more comfortable in the @entity15 stand ”			1
‘ so i said , “ ok , where would that be ? ” and they pointed to some seats and i said that would be fine			0
‘ the stewards acted quite quickly and the last thing i wanted to do was cause them any trouble or offend anyone ’s sensibilities			0
i thought i was just in a mixed section			0
’ @entity6 said he and his family walked the 25 yards into the @entity15 section where they were ‘ greeted with some warmth ’ and ‘ had a much better view of the game ’			1
‘ everyone was very good natured and good humoured , ’ he added .			0
