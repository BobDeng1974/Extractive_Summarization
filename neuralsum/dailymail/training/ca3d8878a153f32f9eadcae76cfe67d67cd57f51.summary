by @entity0 a mother whose baby had a heart attack after being given contaminated feed in hospital has spoken of her anguish at being suspected of poisoning him			1
@entity8 , 27 , was caught up in a police investigation before her son was a week old after he went into cardiac arrest while on a drip feed and in an incubator at @entity14 in @entity15 ( @entity16 )			1
he had been delivered by caesarean section on february 7 2012 , and was taken to another hospital to have surgery to correct a bowel problem diagnosed while he was in the womb			2
probe : police launched a probe after @entity25 ( right ) fell ill in hospital - much to the shock of his mother @entity27 ( left ) but soon after he was brought back to @entity16 , he suffered the heart attack , which investigators later found was due to excessive magnesium in his iv feed			1
after the incident , hospital staff phoned ms @entity8 , who rushed in only to discover her son in a weak and dire state - which nobody could explain			1
she said : ' i was told to come to the hospital as soon as possible , as @entity25 was back on an incubator			2
when i got there , he was also on a ventilator and looked grey			0
it was horrific but no one could tell what had happened			0
' the new mother was then told that police would investigate the incident amid fears her son was poisoned			2
@entity25 survived and is now two years old - but it took a year - long probe by police and medical investigators to conclude that the feed had been to blame			1
ms @entity8 said : ' the investigation was awful , even my partner and i had to be eliminated from suspicion			1
to be involved in something like that was just heartbreaking , especially when all we cared about was @entity25 getting better			2
' @entity25 is now two and a half and , while he needs regular appointments at @entity16 to check his progress , he is on his way to what we hope will be a full recovery			0
' in danger : @entity25 suffered a heart attack just days after having emergency surgery ms @entity8 - who says her partner was also under suspicion - is now taking legal action against the @entity72 - the company which produced the feed			1
she has also called for safety regulations to be overhauled			1
she said : ' we want to know how these problems happened and what is being done to prevent them from happening again			0
' the recent problems outlined by @entity80 brought all of the bad memories back from our experiences			0
no one else should have to face what we have been through and lessons must be learned			0
' @entity87 , a lawyer at solicitors @entity88 , who represent ms @entity8 and her son , said : ' the recent reports linking feed contamination to the death of a child have shone a spotlight on this issue and the products that vulnerable patients are administered during hospital treatment			1
' our work on behalf of mrs @entity8 means we understand the ordeal undergone by parents when an event like this happens and the uncertainty about the long - term consequences this can have on affected children			2
' a @entity112 spokesman confirmed that the 2012 investigation took place , which concluded that no crimes had taken place			0
a @entity16 spokesman said : ' @entity25 came to us as a very sick baby and when he was six days old his condition deteriorated rapidly			0
' due to the astute intervention of our clinical team , this was discovered to be due to high levels of magnesium in @entity25 ’s blood			0
' we are pleased that our swift intervention saved his life			0
we are in regular contact with @entity25 ’s family - who have nothing but praise for our care - and are delighted that he has grown into a healthy two - year - old boy '			2
a legal representative for @entity72 said : ' there was no issue raised at the time of any liability on the part of @entity72 for any medical issues concerning @entity25 ; nor was any such issue raised at the time by the @entity8 family or their solicitors who expressed satisfaction with the outcomes			1
' fifty five bags of the same batch of the food was supplied by @entity72 and no problems of any kind were reported , and no subsequent issues have been raised about any of their products			0

@entity8 , 27 , gave birth to her son @entity25 in february 2012
he needed emergency treatment and was put on a drip afterwards
@entity25 then had heart attack at @entity14 in @entity15
