@entity1 attorney general @entity0 today told the @entity2 he ' knew nothing ' about his agency 's possession of two months ' worth of phone records from reporters and editors of the @entity9			1
like @entity11 press secretary @entity10 a day earlier , he professed to know little or nothing about the case			0
@entity16 @entity15 rep. @entity14 told @entity0 she was frustrated by his @entity18 's seizure of the phone records , and insisted that notifying the @entity9 could not have threatened the integrity of the investigation into a leak of classified information to a reporter			1
' this is both an ongoing matter , and an ongoing matter about which i know nothing , ' @entity0 replied			2
the @entity18 is also investigating the @entity45 for targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny after the applied for tax - exempt status			1
the hearing came barely a half - day after president @entity31 responded to a report from the @entity45 inspector general , which largely exonerated the @entity45 ’s upper management			2
but @entity31 ’s statement seemed calculated to lay the blame at the @entity45 ’s feet , insulating the @entity11 from reporters ’ future questions about responsibility and accountability			2
@entity31 called the @entity45 ’s conduct ‘ intolerable and inexcusable , ’ saying in a statement that ‘ [ t ] he @entity45 must apply the law in a fair and impartial way , and its employees must act with utmost integrity			0
this report shows that some of its employees failed that test			0
’ ‘ regardless of how this conduct was allowed to take place , ’ @entity31 said , ‘ the bottom line is , it was wrong			0
’ the inspector general ’s report found that @entity45 employees in @entity80 , @entity81 , wrongly targeted conservative groups by asking inappropriate questions and justifying them mas part of an investigation into whether the organizations were trying to hide political advocacy behind a façade of public charity			1
back off : @entity0 told the @entity91 - controlled committee : '' i am not familiar with the reasons why [ the case was pursued ] in the way that it was , because i ¿ m simply not a part of the case ' anger : @entity0 was furious at the hearing that an @entity101 member had demanded his resignation the @entity105 , not the @entity103 or the @entity104 , was designated as the lead investigative agency after terrorists attacked the @entity1 @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110			1
the @entity103 's second - in - command in @entity110 at the time of the attack , @entity114 , testified in an earlier hearing that it took ' maybe 18 days to get the @entity105 team to @entity109 ' for an investigation to commence @entity120 @entity119 rep. @entity119 reminded @entity0 that federal regulations required his agency to inform the press before it seized phone records			1
asked why that never happened , @entity0 replied , ' that i do n't know			2
there are exceptions if the integrity of the investigation would be impacted			0
i do n't know why that did n't happen			0
' but he defended his staff , despite not knowing the content of their investigation , or where it has led them			0
' i have faith in the people who actually were responsible for this case , that they were aware of the rules and that they followed them , ' @entity0 said , ' but i do n’t have a factual basis to answer the questions that you have asked , because i was recused			0
' in particular , @entity0 said he was ' not familiar ' with how the @entity18 subpoena was written , or how it was executed			1
@entity11 press secretary @entity10 took questions from reporters while @entity0 faced a grilling at the other end of @entity152			0
like @entity0 , @entity10 has professed that the @entity11 knows little about the @entity45 scandal or the @entity9 phone - record seizures , insisting that the president found out about both matters from published news accounts @entity15 seemed equally bothered by the intrusion of government agencies into journalists ' press freedoms			1
rep. @entity162 , a @entity164 @entity163 and the committee 's ranking opposition member , said he was ' deeply troubled by the notion that our government would secretly pursue such a broad array of media phone records over such a long period of time			1
' @entity173 opened his questioning by pressing @entity0 on the @entity18 's performance before and after the @entity177 bombing			1
the @entity179 government warned the @entity1 about accused bomber @entity180 , who was killed days after the bombing in a police shootout			1
@entity0 suggested in his testimony that it was other nations , not @entity1 's law enforcement officials , who should have done more			1
' i 'm not at all certain , ' he offered , ' that all of the requests that were made to a foreign country by the @entity105 were replied to in an adequate manner			2
' on @entity109 , @entity0 offered a cryptic promise			2
federal authorities , he said , have ' taken steps that are definitive and concrete			0
... we are prepared to reveal shortly what we have done			0
' the attorney general did not elaborate			2
the @entity18 secretly obtained telephone records from april and may of 2012 of reporters and editors for the @entity9 , in what the news outlet 's top executive called a ' massive and unprecedented intrusion ' into how news organizations work notably , @entity0 's prepared testimony did n't address either the @entity45 investigation or the @entity9 phone records case , likely because neither was yet a political football by the time his statement was drafted			1
@entity214 testimony given by high - ranking political appointees typically goes through a lengthy vetting process that can take days or even weeks			0
but under questioning from @entity218 @entity217 rep. @entity217 , @entity0 predicted that the @entity18 's investigation into the @entity45 could involve ' potential civil rights law [ breaking ] , ' as well as ' false statement violations			1
' @entity217 called the @entity45 's targeting of tea party groups and other conservative applicants for tax - exempt status ' a threat to our democracy			2
' @entity15 rep. @entity229 of @entity230 also asked about the @entity45 investigation , suggesting that employees who targeted tea party groups could face felony charges			2
@entity0 said he was n't so sure , although the conduct involved was ' outrageous			2
' ' to the extent that there are enforcement gaps that we find , we will let this committee know , ' he said			0
@entity109 it allegedly took the @entity105 18 days to arrive and set up an investigation after terrorists laid waste to the @entity1 @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , leaving four @entity1 dead			1
and few answers have been forthcoming about why the @entity31 administration has been so tight - lipped about the subsequent investigation			0
@entity0 likely knows everything , and republicans on @entity249 want that information			0
@entity9 phone records the @entity18 secretly obtained the phone records of @entity9 journalists in at least three cities without informing the news bureau beforehand , in order to learn who leaked information about a classified @entity260 operation			1
but federal regulations generally require notification of journalists before the government invades their @entity266 freedoms			0
@entity0 claims to know nothing , saying that he recused himself from the investigation since he himself was interviewed in connection with the probe			1
but that begs the question of how anyone at the top levels of the @entity18 could investigate the leak without an apparent conflict of interest , since many if not all of them have security clearances sufficient to see the material that was leaked			0
@entity45 targeting @entity283 the @entity45 has admitted running a longstanding program that targeted right - wing groups - including those aligned with the politically successful tea party - for extra scrutiny , through delay tactics and intrusive mandatory questionnaires			1
@entity0 has announced an investigation , but is tight - lipped about whether he suspects laws were broken			0
one @entity91 senator has called for the @entity45 commissioner to be fired , while the speaker of the @entity11 has asked aloud whether anyone is ‘ going to jail			0
’ since that ‘ anyone ’ is likely to be a political appointee , @entity91 are frustrated at @entity0 ’s coy answers and his claim to know little at this early point in the investigation			0
@entity303 @entity0 and other cabinet officials have been criticized for failing to act on warnings from @entity179 , and perhaps other nations , about the accused @entity177 bomber @entity180			1
and the @entity105 was lambasted for showing photos of the @entity180 brothers publicly instead of asking the @entity310 of @entity177 to identify them			1
once they saw their photos on television , the brothers ran – shooting a police officer to death in the process .			0

@entity18 seized @entity9 phone records without notifying journalists or their editors , and @entity0 claims to know nothing
it took the @entity105 fully 18 days to arrive in @entity109 after the terror attack on a @entity1 **diplomat*ic* *outpost* there , according to a senior *diplomat*
attorney general is catching flak for not acting on tips from foreign governments about the accused @entity177 bomber @entity180
@entity0 wo n't commit to criminal *penalties* for @entity45 agents who targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny and intrusive *inquisitions*
