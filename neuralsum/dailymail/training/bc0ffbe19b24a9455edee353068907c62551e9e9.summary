@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was visibly disappointed after the @entity2 suffered a 2 - 0 defeat in their @entity5 opener at @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity8 struck either side of half - time and the @entity12 club would have been more emphatic victors than 2 - 0 but for the reflexes of @entity15 and their own wastefulness			1
@entity0 told @entity18 5 : ' we faced a tough side in one of the most difficult stadiums in @entity22 , we knew that from the start			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 and vice-captain @entity24 look on after conceding in @entity6 @entity7 scores @entity6 's first goal on the stroke of half time which @entity0 called sloppy ' they put us under pressure , it was very sloppy from us to concede the goal with 20 seconds to go in the first half from a long throw from the other side of the pitch and after you are 1 - 0 down , it 's very difficult			1
they are very quick on the break and we did n't perform well enough tonight			0
' the 32 - year - old @entity40 was aware of the pace @entity6 had up front which @entity1 failed to cope with			1
he added : ' they put a lot of pace and a lot of pressure up front			2
when they play here and when you ( are familiar ) - we 've been playing here every year in the @entity5 - but we could n't cope with that and we gave the ball away too many times in our own half in difficult positions			2
' for the second time in two matches @entity58 illustrated why his finishing is considered below par for a top forward by failing to convert a one - on - one with a goalkeeper			0
@entity8 made it 2 - 0 early in the second period as @entity6 dominated @entity64 looks on as his side are completely dismantled by a high - energy @entity6 with the match goalless and @entity1 under relentless attack , @entity58 managed to drag @entity69 's clever pass wide with just @entity70 to beat			1
it was a key moment and the Â£ 16million signing from @entity73 , who had other chances to open his @entity2 account , only enhanced concerns over his record in front of goal			0
on the @entity2 ' chances during the match @entity0 added : ' they took the game from where they wanted to take it and that 's the disappointing thing for us			2
' i think we had three or four very clear chances and i think they had three as well very clear , when it came to chances it was probably equal but i think they were the better side tonight			1
' @entity0 is put under pressure as the @entity1 midfielders were throughout in the @entity98 @entity6 coach @entity99 was delighted with the result and said matches like this make his job one of the best in the world			1
he said : ' we had three players ruled out of the team to muscle problems so it was not the best night we had but in the morning we made some decisions and i have to say it was a great performance from my team			0
' we were brave and fast and really worked , it was everything we needed for this game			0
' if you give them one metre of space they are so strong and they make everything with you			0
you need to brave against these strong players			0
@entity1 's new striker @entity58 had the @entity2 ' best chance at 0 - 0 but slid the ball wide ' you need go out in space and look for one - to - one situations and be brave enough to lose it because the next one is next to you			1
' i enjoyed this game from the first second to the last			0
' looking ahead to his side 's next tough encounter - saturday 's return to the @entity136 , @entity99 added : ' we did what we have to win this game and for us it was near perfection so the important thing for me is three days and against @entity143 , my former club			2
' it 's hard work all the time but if you see games like this , it 's the best job in the world			0

@entity6 score either side of half time to win 2 - 0
@entity1 fail to cope with ' pace and pressure ' from @entity6 forwards
@entity0 *bemoans* failure to take ' three or four very clear chances '
@entity99 *praises* his ' brave and fast ' @entity6 team
