@entity1 prosecutors have filed state - level murder charges tuesday against the white supremacist accused in shootings that left three people dead at two jewish community sites in suburban @entity7			1
@entity8 has been charged with one count of capital murder for the deaths of 14 - year - old boy and his grandfather outside the @entity14			1
@entity8 also faces one count of first - degree , premeditated murder for the death of a woman who was gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex			1
the capital murder charge carries the death penalty as possible punishment and @entity8 is being held on $ 10million bond			2
@entity8 was arrested sunday after shooting and killing three people at two different @entity14 centers in @entity7 , @entity1			1
@entity8 is from southwest @entity43 who founded the @entity45 in his native @entity46 and later the @entity45			0
none of sunday 's victims were @entity14 : dr. @entity49 , 69 , and his grandson @entity50 , 14 , were at the community center for a singing contest audition , while 53 - year - old @entity53 was visiting her mother at the retirement complex			1
the @entity56 also monitors , to varying degrees , the activities of hundreds of known white supremacists and anti-semites at any given time			0
federal authorities were well - aware of the racist war vet , as were the @entity56 and the @entity64 , who sometimes was known as @entity8			2
familiar : @entity8 , seen during his arrest on sunday and in the subsequent mugshot , was put in witness protection in 1987 in exchange for testimony on fellow @entity72 members after a 1986 contempt - of - court conviction in @entity46 for operating a paramilitary camp , @entity8 went in hiding while free on bond and fled to @entity43			1
there , federal agents found him and several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades , automatic weapons and thousands of bullets			0
@entity8 entered federal witness protection programs in 1987 , according to @entity84 , and agreed to cooperate with authorities			1
it is not clear when the protection ended			0
indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of @entity56 founder @entity91 , @entity8 served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other @entity72 leaders			1
' we were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups , ' @entity97 special agent @entity96 said at a monday press conference			2
federal prosecutors say there 's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime			2
victims : dr. @entity108 , and his grandson @entity50 ( left ) were at the @entity14 for a singing competition while @entity53 ( right ) was visiting her mother at a @entity14 assisted living facility			0
none of the victims were @entity14 moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if @entity8 is convicted			1
' the motivation behind these attacks was a hate crime ... he was trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity , ’ @entity97 agent @entity96 said at a monday press conference			2
before the shootings , @entity8 had been contemptuous of some of his like - minded allies ' reliance on social media over violent confrontation			0
' he felt it was easy to be a ' keyboard commando , ' but that the only way activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets , ' said @entity135 , the vice president of the @entity136 on @entity137			0
history of violence : authorities were aware of @entity8 ( who also went by the name @entity142 ) since the early 1980s when he founded the @entity45 , seen here in 1984 racist : in recent years , watchdog groups were aware of @entity145 , seen here in an undated photo , and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often , they became less concerned @entity135 said his group made a presentation on white supremacists to the @entity14 in august , a discussion that included a description of @entity145 as an example of dangerous anti-semitic figures in the region			1
it was n't clear what , if any , steps were taken by the center to act on the information			0
the timing of the attack is worth noting , as a group monitoring anti-semitic attacks in the @entity166 cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two weeks before this weekend ’s attack			0
in a report april 1 , the @entity64 noted a 19 per cent drop in anti-semitic incidents last year compared to 2012 , part of what the group called a ' decade - long downward slide ' and one of its lowest tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979 .			0

@entity8 has been charged with three counts of murder and separate hate crime charges are expected later
the former @entity72 leader is the prime *suspect* in the sunday shootings at a @entity14 and retirement center that left three dead
new reports *reveal* the government and *anti-hate* groups were aware of him and the threat he posed before the shooting
was put in witness protection in 1987 after he *turned* into an informant to avoid jail time when he fled the state on bail for a different charge
a human rights group gave a presentation in august at the @entity206 he attacked and named @entity8 as a dangerous anti-semitic in the area
