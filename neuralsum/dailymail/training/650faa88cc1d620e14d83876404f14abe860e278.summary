as @entity2 gears up for the @entity3 this evening , 230 miles above @entity1 , astronauts are having their own microgravity kick - about			1
@entity7 astronauts @entity5 and @entity8 , and @entity10 astronaut @entity9 , will be watching the action from aboard the @entity12			2
and to celebrate the opening ceremony , the three astronauts showed off their microgravity football skills by performing impressive bicycle kicks , spins and somersaults while kicking a ball			1
the astronaut also sent down a special message to all the players and teams as they compete in @entity3 2014 which kicks off in @entity34 today and finishes on july 13			1
from left , expedition 40 commander @entity8 and flight engineers @entity9 and @entity5 wish football fans and the @entity3 2014 ' peaceful games ' the weightless movement of the astronauts is because they are in a continuous state of freefall			2
pictured here astronauts onboard the @entity12 have their own kickabout ahead of the @entity3 @entity9 said : ‘ we want to wish all the teams and fans on the ground and in @entity2 a great @entity3 have fun and have peaceful games			1

’ the astronauts have trained for years to work together as a unified crew , but the @entity7 astronauts and their @entity10 crewmate are feeling a little friendly competition			2
many people think gravity does n't exist in space			0
however , typical orbital altitudes for human spaceflight vary between 120 - 360 miles above @entity1 's surface			2
the gravitational field is still quite strong in these regions , since this is only about 1.8 percent the distance to the moon			0
@entity1 's gravitational field at about 250 miles 0 about the distance of the @entity12 - is 88.8 percent of its strength at the surface			2
the condition of microgravity comes about whenever an object is in free fall			0
objects in a state of free fall or orbit are said to be weightless			0
the object 's mass is the same , but it would register ' 0 ' on a scale their home countries will play against each other for a chance to advance out of @entity84 of the @entity3 matches			1
@entity7 and @entity86 face off on june 26 at @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity2			1
