by @entity0 berserk : @entity2 , 48 , was shot with a taser by police after going on a rampage when neighbours found out he was dumping his own rubbish in their wheelie bins a man was tasered by police after going on a rampage when neighbours found out he was secretly dumping rubbish in their bins			1
@entity2 , 48 , filled other bins around the neighbourhood with the leftovers of his diy projects because he had no place to put them himself			1
but his ploy was exposed after neighbours noticed their wheelie bins were overflowing so much bin men were refusing to empty them on health and safety grounds			1
after discovering @entity2 was responsible , one woman confronted him at his home in @entity29 , @entity30			1
but he reacted by running at the 35 - year - old @entity31 with a kitchen broom handle raised above his head before hitting her four times on the head , neck , back and left arm			1
when @entity38 , 52 , came out of her nearby home to intervene , @entity2 then ' came at her ' , hitting her hip and threatening to fetch a hammer			1
by the time police arrived , @entity2 was brandishing a cordless drill with a nail sticking out of the end and began waving it at the officers			1
they were forced to used the 50,000 volt device to overpower him			2
@entity30 @entity50 was told @entity2 , who lived alone , suffered from bipolar disorder and had an ' isolated life			2
' it emerged he had also taken another neighbour 's wheelie bin and chained it up to his house			1
he admitted common assault , assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray during a hearing last thursday and was jailed for 12 months			1
scene : @entity2 carried out the three - hour attack @entity29 in the @entity63 of @entity30 @entity2 had been living at the rented property for 14 months before the three hour rampage on june 16			1
retired builder @entity66 , 57 , miss @entity38 's partner of five years , said : ' @entity2 was an absolute nightmare			1
he just used to scream and scream and talk to himself because he lived there on his own and we used to hear lots of drilling			0
' i had been round to tell him to keep the noise down but he held a hammer up to me and slammed the door in my face			0
he is a nutcase but i was never scared of him			0
' police were trying to catch him out but he had cameras and microphones installed on the premises so he would be able to see them coming to the door before they could catch him			2
' when i spoke to the owner of the house , he invited me in and said " look what he 's done here " and he 'd drilled a massive hole in the wall as though he was trying to get something through here			2
' upstairs in the bedroom there is a big section of the ceiling missing			0
' it 's been a lot more quiet since he has been in custody			2
@entity38 will be glad to hear he is going to spend longer in prison			0
' @entity103 , 32 , restaurant supervisor said : ' one day i put the bin out , came back from work and the bin was n't there			2
' so i walked up the street looking for it and realised my bin was chained to this man 's property with something similar to a bike lock			1
' i knocked on the door and nobody answered but the next door neighbour came out and told me he was a bit strange			0
threats : police were forced to used the 50,000 volt device to overpower @entity2 , who was brandishing a cordless drill ' i kept knocking because i wanted to ask him how he did it but he didnt answer so i just got some pliers , cut through the chains and took my bin home			1
i presumed he took the bin by mistake			0
' a third neighbour said : ' he was forever doing diy at the house drilling holes into his wall for no apparent reason and being noisy			0
it seemed he was obsessd with @entity135			0
' the bins thing was the final straw			0
it 's bad enough having all these wheelie bins anyway never mind having someone else fill them for you so they wo n't get emptied			0
' in court @entity2 claimed the attack had been a ' wake - up call ' for him and would force him to deal with his obsessions			2
but judge @entity149 told him : ' what 's clearly been going on is that your , perhaps to certain people , slightly unusual behaviour at times has annoyed them			0
' they have made it clear to you that they do n't like the noise you make or the way you handle your refuse , and your illness affects the way you react			0
' on this particular day you obviously boiled over and lost your cool			0
' there 's no excuse for running out of the house with a broom handle			1
people are entitled to live in their streets and go about their business feeling safe - you must avoid confrontation with your neighbours			0
