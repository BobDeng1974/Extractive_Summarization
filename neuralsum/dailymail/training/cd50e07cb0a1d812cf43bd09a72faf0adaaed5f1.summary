the @entity0 is just 23 days away and excitement is building			1
each week our man in @entity4 , @entity2 , brings us the latest news and views from @entity7 - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the @entity0 in @entity4 is shaping up			1
the first sign is the closed merchandise store in the hotel lobby			0
more subtle hints soon follow , the near - empty beaches , the complete lack of even a solitary flag or street decoration			2
but nothing could have summed it up better than the match fizzing out of the television at the beach hut bar across the road			0
there are eight sports channels available on even the most basic @entity4 satellite package , ensuring that the cradle of football is never left wanting , never at risk of running dry			2
and yet yesterday lunchtime , in this @entity35 suburb , across the road from the @entity37 that @entity38 and @entity39 will call home in a couple of short weeks , it was @entity42 and @entity43 who were being beamed out on the widescreen ... rugby ... @entity48 top 14 rugby at that			1
peaceful : @entity39 's @entity0 base while in @entity35 is the quiet @entity53 hotel in sleepy @entity54 calming influence : @entity38 's @entity39 team will hope to keep their mind on the job in their quiet hotel while the rest of the host nation begins to rapidly pick up the pace and catch @entity0 fever ( about time , given that there 's just three weeks to kick - off now ) , @entity54 is the definition of seaside sleepiness			1
and it might just suit @entity39 fine			2
it might just be the coastal oasis they did n't know they needed			0
okay , a monday afternoon in winter is never likely to be the most hectic of time slots but the contrast between the slumbering surrounds of the @entity53 and the @entity74 a mere six kilometres back up the coast could n't be more stark			1
the latter hotel is smack bang in the middle of @entity79 , the red - hot centre of @entity35 's tourist hub , a landing spot for a fair whack of the 600,000 expected to descend on @entity4 pretty soon			1
it also happens to be the base chosen by @entity86 and @entity87			1
there 's a bone dry joke to be made about the fact that it is @entity39 and not the @entity91 who will call a place with a giant golden tulip on the edifice home during the @entity0			1
given that the incoming @entity99 manager was once labelled a ' dictator , without the slightest sense of humour ' by @entity103 , @entity97 probably would n't appreciate the joke			0
but , with the already intense spotlight being ratcheted up a couple of hundred watts in the wake of yesterday 's confirmation from @entity109 , he 'd arguably appreciate the peace and quiet that his @entity112 counterpart will enjoy here in @entity35			1
party time : @entity39 have avoided the hussle and bussle of @entity35 's @entity79 , where the @entity91 are staying @entity54 is cut off from @entity117 , @entity118 and the heart of the city by a soaring rock outcrop called @entity122			1
it translates as @entity124 and together they 'll give the @entity39 a shield from the hype and the hoopla and the heat			2
not that they are actively running away from it , they may just have found welcome shade by accident ( the original hotel they picked was on the seafront in @entity118 but @entity38 and advisors quickly changed tack when @entity139 unveiled plans for a massive fan fest and big screens across the road )			1
it may not be an official @entity146 diktat but across the board relaxation , a loosening of the leash , appears to be the theme of the planning behind this campaign			0
unlike @entity158 last time out and the circus of @entity156 before that , @entity39 's team hotel will not be closed off to the public			1
if you 'd been prompt enough last year you could have booked a room and a spot next to @entity163 and the boys at the breakfast buffet or the balcony pool			0
exposed : sunbathers hit the beach at @entity117 wearing the typically minimal @entity4 bikini football crazy : the locals of the @entity79 practice their moves ahead of this summer 's @entity0 the @entity53 has undergone an expensive refurb with finishing touches still being made to the grounds yesterday , while inside all was deathly quiet			1
the bar was empty , the restaurants , including a well - equipped burger bar , equally short of punters			0
the lobby 's @entity0 shop - featuring only @entity4 merchandise , not a @entity182 in sight - was shut but two luxury jewellery shops on site , including @entity186 , were open for business , readying for the invasion of the @entity189 perhaps			1
the @entity190 ( not a whole pile of imagination used in coming up with that name ) next door is equally looking forward to @entity195 pitching up			0
but monday lunchtime was very much the calm before that storm			0
the always frantic @entity199 favela - with a population estimated somewhere north of 200,000 - may be a six - minute walk away from the hotel 's door ( in its previous guise as the @entity206 , there was a hostage shoot - out here just four years ago ) but it is passing buses that make the only racket outside the grounds			1
getting ready : @entity39 's @entity212 ( left ) , @entity213 and @entity214 off to the training camp there are n't a whole pile of other hotels about , instead @entity54 is primarily where some of @entity35 's affluent escape home to after a day in the chaos and gridlock of the city , which admittedly @entity39 will have to partly navigate on their daily trek to their training pitch at the military academy in @entity225 away			1
@entity228 , @entity163 and the rest will move in on june 8 when their preparations in @entity231 are complete			0
yesterday @entity54 looked like it could n't care less			2
wannabe surfers practiced in the whitewash , one in an @entity237 shirt with @entity238 emblazoned on the back , a cyclist whizzed by on the prom in an @entity242 jersey but that 's about all the football you got until four locals begin a languid game of foot - volley on the beach			2
fittingly , by @entity4 standards , it 's low - key			1
that might just suit @entity39 fine			2
hectic : @entity86 boss @entity87 and his players will be staying right in the heart of the action in @entity117 oh ye of little faith ! with a whopping 24 days to spare ( what was all the rushing about ? ) , the venue for the opening game of the @entity0 held its first proper football match on sunday and passed the test with , not quite flying colours , but airborne shades of white and grey			1
@entity267 , which will also play host to what shapes to be @entity39 's decisive clash with @entity271 in @entity272 , welcomed 36,000 through the turnstiles			1
there were issues with the unfinished roof and @entity139 today confirmed another last - minute test match on may 29 just to be really sure but in what was a hit - or - miss moment , this was a hit , apart from the small matter of what happened on the field			2
@entity283 were humbled by bottom boys @entity285 , a timely reminder that after all the build - up there is the small matter of delivering on the pitch too			0
unfinished : the @entity267 - where @entity39 play @entity271 - hosted its first match on the weekend okay , if it seems like we feature @entity295 every other week , that 's probably because we do			1
but there 's just no escaping the big man down here			0
as the figurehead of @entity301 's 2014 incarnation , the targetman is , well , a target			0
opposing defenders love nothing more than going toe - to - toe with the man the nation will depend upon in a few weeks			0
and they know how to wind him up			0
it all got too much for @entity295 this weekend when two yellow cards in 90 seconds - the second courtesy of a disgraceful dive from @entity314 's @entity313 - saw the @entity316 man sent off			1
@entity301 might be glad to see his lynchpin get some rest			0
but if his no 9 ca n't keep his cool against a wiry antagonist in the domestic game , can he rely on him to take on the world next month ? remember me ? @entity325 ( @entity237 / @entity326 ) think you 've seen @entity325 in every ridiculous environment imaginable ? unless you 've seen him play a human chair , you might just have to think that one over again			2
@entity331 may the one truly cleaning up on the endorsement front with nearly £ 20million in sponsorship deals already secured			0
but that does n't mean there 's no room for @entity325 aboard the gravy train			2
the @entity338 is far from hated in these parts and seems as game for a laugh as ever if this ad for a @entity4 version of @entity344 is anything to go by			2
part of the @entity0 furniture ? you bet			2
flustered : @entity349 boss @entity301 believes a public inquiry into his finances is ' malicious ' quote of the week : ' if it is a confidential inquiry , why has it been made public ? because it ’s something malicious			0
' big @entity301 not all that enamoured with the @entity359 authorities for going public with their investigations into his alleged tax irregularities , the timing of which was a little too convenient for the host nation 's liking			2
@entity365 tip : attack of the cloners this one , unfortunately , comes from personal experience			0
but seeing as we 're just 22 days away now , the first waves of the estimated 600,000 overseas visitors will be pitching up in @entity4 's international airports from this week onwards			1
so a word of warning - do n't use the airport atms			0
entry points are absolute blackspots for credit and atm card cloning with @entity35 's @entity380 the most notorious of the lot ... even the major international banks who have machines at the terminal			1
having fallen victim to the skimmers ourselves , and endured a six - week wait for new cards to arrive , just do yourselves a favour and have enough cash for the taxi or bus into the city			0
@entity397 forecast : how ’s the weather up in @entity399 ? okay , we 've fretted over the heat and humidity and tropical @entity403 deluges for a fair few months now			0
things do n't look like changing there any time soon but maybe we should be more worried about @entity272 if this weekend was anything to go by			0
a winter @entity0 in @entity4 should still have promised plenty of sun but we 're not so sure fans signed up for hail storms last seen the other side of the @entity412			1
these pictures of locals wading through feet - deep hail paint a not so pretty picture			0
give us humidity any day !			0

@entity38 's @entity39 team will stay at @entity35 's @entity53 hotel in quiet @entity54 , well away from bright lights of @entity117 and @entity118 beaches
hotel will not be cut off from the public , as it was in the @entity426 of 2010 and 2006
@entity87 's @entity86 team are staying at @entity74 on the lively @entity79
the still - to - be - finished @entity267 - where @entity39 play @entity271 - hosted its first match on the weekend without any major problems
@entity4 's hot - head *striker* @entity295 was sent off again for @entity434
@entity325 has been busy endorsing products in advance of the @entity0
