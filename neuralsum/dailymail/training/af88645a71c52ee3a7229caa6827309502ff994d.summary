the little and large combination of @entity1 and @entity2 combined on saturday night to blow the tennis world off its axis by slaying two of the finest players the game has ever known			1
they set up the most unlikely @entity10 final by downing @entity11 and @entity12 with two seismic shocks at @entity14 coming in quick succession			1
first the 24 year - old @entity2 , just 5 ’ 10 ” and eleven stone , braved fierce heat and humidity to beat world number one @entity12 6 - 4 1 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 3 in two hours and 52 minutes			1
monday ’s totally unforeseen climax will be the first @entity23 final since 2005 without a member of the so - called @entity34 , and the first in twelve years not to have anyone from the top ten in it			1
@entity1 , now coached by former @entity40 champion @entity39 , put in a performance of huge aggression that ended with three aces in the final game to take out a bewildered @entity11 , who had looked on for another @entity46 title			1
meanwhile @entity2 becomes the first player from his country to make a @entity23 final			1
he handled the brutal conditions better than the reigning @entity40 champion , who for once was outlasted			0
history maker : @entity2 celebrates beating world no 1 @entity12 in the @entity10 semi-final performance : @entity11 was uncharacteristically poor when returning @entity1 's serves power : after dispensing of @entity58 in the quarter - final , @entity1 excelled again to defeat @entity11 it was a brilliant display from the number ten seed , whose nerve occasionally failed him but eventually held out to pull off a seismic result against the strong favourite for the title , who defeated @entity68 in the previous round			1
' it ’s an amazing feeling i ’m so happy , ' said an ecstatic @entity2 afterwards			2
' i hope i can recover for the final			0
i hope it ’s big news in @entity75			0
' remarkably , world number eleven @entity2 came here having not played in august due to an operation to remove a cyst from his foot : ' i just started playing points few days before the tournament , ' he said			2
' i did n't even know if i should come to @entity83 , you know , so i was n't expecting anything actually			0
but after playing first match and second match i get more confidence on my foot and it was no pain in these moments			0
i was start sliding little more			0
but my tennis was there already			0
” helpless : @entity12 was formidable in the second set but @entity2 was otherwise in control quarters : @entity11 had endured a grueling quarter - final , beating @entity97 in five sets final : @entity1 reaches his first ever final at the @entity10 in @entity14 @entity12 was at a loss to explain a surprisingly lacklustre performance and was reluctant to blame the punishing environment : ' it was not easy to play in these conditions , but he had spent more hours on the court before this			1
so it 's no excuse , ' said @entity12			0
' i could n’t control the ball , did n’t have the balance			0
' trained at the @entity115 / @entity114 in @entity116 from the age of fourteen , @entity2 ’s experience of @entity113 summers came into its own as he refused to flag against @entity12			2
his coach @entity119 seemed more animated than he ever was as player as he watched from the bench , urging on his young charge , who actually lost in the first round of this event last year to @entity127 ’s @entity126			0
@entity2 , whose previous @entity23 best was losing to @entity68 in the @entity129 quarters final , showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten @entity131 on clay in the @entity134 final before seizing up with cramp , but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career			2
final : @entity2 reached the final after beating @entity12 in the other semi-final			1

@entity1 beat @entity11 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4
@entity24 reaches his first ever @entity10 ( and @entity23 ) final
@entity2 beat @entity12 in the other semi-final
@entity2 is the first @entity148 man to reach a @entity23 final
