by @entity0 hitting back : @entity1 said people need to understand where meat comes from novelist @entity1 yesterday hit back at claims that she was ‘ callous ’ for posting photographs of a rabbit she had killed , skinned and cooked for raiding her vegetable patch			1
she said too many meat - eaters were ‘ squeamish ’ and needed to face the reality that animals were slaughtered to put food on their plates , adding : ‘ they are not made of fairy dust , they do n’t drop out of the sky			1
’ this week the author , best known for the bestseller @entity19 , sparked a frenzy on @entity23 after posting pictures of the unfortunate animal lying disembowelled on her chopping board with the caption : ‘ @entity28 ate my parsley			1
i am eating the rabbit			2
’ miss @entity1 , 54 , who lives in the village @entity32 in the @entity33 , went on to describe how she had cooked it in cider with rosemary and thyme for a meal with ‘ no waste , no packaging , no processing and no food miles ’			1
but she managed to antagonise some of her 34,000 followers by pointing out that its head would make a ‘ great glove puppet ’ before feeding its entrails to her cat			0
yesterday animal rights campaigner @entity50 , associate director of @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , said the public were right to be ‘ outraged ’			1
she added : ‘ @entity1 makes a solid point about the horrors of modern farming , but that does n’t diminish her own callousness			2
‘ rabbits are sensitive , smart , social animals who form life - long bonds , and each has a personality in his or her own right			2
‘ snuffing them out for a fleeting moment of taste is arrogant , ignorant and cruel , whether they are trapped , factory farmed or shot			0
’ however the author hit back at her critics , insisting unprecedented hordes of bunnies had been munching her flowers and vegetables			2
‘ the rabbit population is out of control this year – nobody knows why , ’ she told @entity79 ’s @entity80 , adding : ‘ you ca n’t simply leave them to breed			1
one of the pictures posted on @entity23 by author @entity1 after she killed and skinned a rabbit that was eating her parsley @entity1 , the author of @entity19 , also used the social media site the tell her 32,700 followers that the offed bunny would make a ' great glove puppet ' ‘ it seems to me if you ’re going to cull a rabbit , you might as well eat it – why waste it ? ’ she went on to say : ‘ i have got a rabbit population which is decimating my vegetable garden and my flower garden			1
‘ now , either i stand by and let that happen or i deal with it			0
i live in the country , i ’ve lived here for 20 years , i ’m going to deal with it			0
’ she told the programme she had not expected her photographs to go viral , describing some of her critics as trolls who ‘ just love to go online , they are not interested in having an argument , they just want to fire abuse ’			0
but she welcomed the debate her posts had sparked , saying : ‘ there ought to be a discussion , because i would like people to understand what it means to eat animals			0
they are not made of fairy dust , they do n’t drop out of the sky			1
‘ if you eat meat , why are you squeamish about seeing someone gut a rabbit with her own hands and eat it ? ’ one follower had branded her ‘ sick ’ and said she would boycott her books – prompting miss @entity1 to suggest that a reading list confined to vegetarian authors would be extremely restrictive			1
rabbits are legally classified as pests and cause an estimated £ 100million of damage every year , wrecking crops as well as undermining riverbanks with their burrows , increasing the risk of floods			0
legislation dating back to the 1950s puts an ‘ obligation ’ on landowners to kill wild rabbits , but says that this has to be done in a humane manner			0
yesterday some reactions online were supportive , with @entity149 posting : ‘ funny how people who eat meat can be offended by this			2
what do you think you are eating in your sunday roast ? ’ and @entity33 pest controller @entity156 , 28 , backed @entity1 , saying : ‘ i ’ve never known a year like it for rabbits – it ’s down to the mild winter which gave them more time to breed			1
‘ people who ’ve lived around here all their lives see trapping rabbits as an everyday thing that ’s happened for years			0
if it controls the rabbits and puts a meal on your table , who can argue with that ? ’			0
