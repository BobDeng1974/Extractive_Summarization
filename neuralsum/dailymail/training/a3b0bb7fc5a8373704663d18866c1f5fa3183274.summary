by @entity0 published : 13:49 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 11 february 2013 if you do n't like coffee or tea , @entity1 has a new breakfast drink that might perk you up			1
@entity6 is rolling out a new drink called @entity8 this month that has @entity1 flavor but is made with 5per cent juice and @entity11 and @entity12 , along with an extra jolt of caffeine			1
the company , based in @entity16 , @entity17 , is hoping to boost sales by reaching @entity1 fans at a new time of day : morning			1
morning soda : kickstart is a new take on @entity1 , with vitamins , caffeine and artificial sweeteners , designed to be consumed at breakfast time @entity6 said it does n't consider @entity8 to be an energy drink , noting that it still has far less caffeine than drinks like @entity30 and @entity31 and none of the mysterious ingredients that have raised concerns among lawmakers and consumer advocates			1
but @entity8 , which comes in flavors such as ' energizing orange citrus ' and ' energizing fruit punch , ' could nevertheless give the company a side - door into the fast - growing energy drink market without getting tangled in any of its controversies			2
the drink comes in the same 16 - ounce cans as popular energy drinks made by @entity48 , which also offers options with juice content			2
and the tv ad features young men skateboarding , reminiscent of the marketing themes used by energy drink makers			0
' it 's a very interesting experiment capturing a number of attributes ' @entity58 , chief marketing officer for @entity6 's @entity60 beverages , says the idea for @entity8 came about after the company learned through consumer research that @entity1 fans were looking for an alternative to traditional morning drinks such as coffee , tea and juice			1
' they did n't really see anything that fit their needs , ' he said			0
@entity58 said @entity8 was developed independently from a @entity75 breakfast drink introduced last year that combines @entity1 and orange juice			1
@entity6 says @entity8 , which is carbonated , is also not a soda because its 5 percent juice content qualifies it to be considered a ' juice drink ' under guidelines set by the @entity81			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity81 said the agency does n't have definitions for what qualifies as a soda or an energy drink			0
with the growth of energy drinks such as @entity30 and @entity31 expected to slow , @entity8 could also signal the emergence of a new category that plays off the promise of energy and other health benefits , said @entity95 , publisher of the trade journal @entity96			0
caffeine - charged : kickstart will be promoted by a tv ad featuring young men skateboarding , reminiscent of marketing themes used for energy drinks in a nod to the growing concerns about sugary drinks , for example , @entity8 also uses artificial sweeteners to reduce its caloric content to about half that of regular soda ; a can has 80 calories			1
' it 's a very interesting experiment capturing a number of attributes , ' @entity95 said , likening it to @entity115 ' refreshers drinks , which promise ' natural energy ' from green coffee extract			2
the promise of ' energy ' has been a big seller in the beverage industry in recent years , with the energy drink market increasing 17per cent in 2011 even as broader soft drink consumption has continued to decline , according to @entity96			0
@entity6 and the @entity123 have largely watched that growth from the sidelines , however , with players such as @entity48 and @entity31 dominating the market			0
but the surging popularity of energy drinks has also led to sharper scrutiny			0
this summer , @entity17 's attorney general launched an investigation into the marketing prices of energy drink makers including @entity30 and @entity6 , which also makes @entity135			0
lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups have also called on the @entity81 to investigate the safety of the high levels of caffeine in energy drinks for younger people			0
although @entity8 may look like an energy drink , it has far less caffeine , at 92 milligrams for a 16 - ounce can			0
a comparable amount of regular @entity1 would have 72 milligrams of caffeine while a can of @entity6 's @entity135 energy drink has 142 milligrams , according to the @entity151			1
by comparison , a 16 - ounce cup of @entity115 coffee has 330 milligrams of caffeine .			1

kickstart was *inspired* by the @entity1 and orange juice mix served by @entity75 as part of its breakfast offering
the new beverage has 80 calories per can and less caffeine than a cup of coffee
