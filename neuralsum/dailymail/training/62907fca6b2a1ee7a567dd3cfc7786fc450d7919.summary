branded : @entity1 's @entity0 in a @entity3 jacket the @entity1 has been accused of allowing its presenters to advertise @entity3 clothing by ‘ the back door ’ – after negotiating a deal to buy jackets at a 45 per cent discount			1
@entity10 has spent thousands kitting out staff on its most popular programmes in a range of the brand ’s latest jackets and fleeces			2
presenters such as @entity1 news anchor @entity19 and diplomatic correspondent @entity20 have been seen in the jackets bearing the brand ’s red and blue logo alongside the name @entity3			1
regional reporters @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , science host professor @entity30 and @entity31 presenter @entity0 have also worn them on screen			1
@entity1 editorial guidelines state that staff should adhere to a set of strict rules banning them from the on - screen promotion of products or brands			1
the reason for @entity3 ’s on - screen popularity is the @entity1 ’s massive discount on the brand			1
but @entity44 accused the corporation of ‘ advertising by the back door ’ and many licence fee payers have aired their concerns on internet message boards			2
one wrote : ‘ the advertising of products or the deliberate , prominent display of commercial brand logos whilst on - screen by @entity1 personnel is forbidden by @entity45			1
’ another wrote : ‘ why do i keep seeing tv presenters wearing @entity3 coats ? just seen one with the @entity3 logo on one side and @entity1 on the other			1
what ’s this shameless advertising on the @entity1 ? ’ the @entity66 can reveal through the @entity67 that the @entity1 bought 169 jackets from @entity3 during the last financial year			2
when bought in shops , the waterproof jackets cost between £ 85 and £ 320			2
logos : @entity27 ( left ) and @entity19 are seen with the distinctive motifs but the @entity1 has negotiated a deal to purchase the items for a corporate discount worth a minimum of 45 per cent , although bigger discounts may apply			1
the jackets were given out free of charge to staff on location , but the @entity10 refused to say how much it has spent on them and who received them			2
estimates based on an average - priced jacket costing £ 200 would put the figure at more than £ 18,500 in the past year , including the discount			2
the special deal has been in existence since 2005 – prompting speculation the @entity1 has actually spent much more on clothing since it came into place			2
as part of a separate deal , @entity1 staff are already entitled to purchase @entity3 items personally at a discount of 45 per cent			0
' clearly the licence fee payers do n't benefit from this arrangement ' @entity99 insisted it had no arrangement to advertise any brand of clothing via on - screen presenters			1
but @entity105 mp @entity104 , a member of the @entity107 media select committee , said : ‘ it is inappropriate for any relationship to exist between the @entity1 and any commercial organisation wanting to advertise through the back door , and this appears to be a case of just that			0
' clearly the licence fee payers do n’t benefit from this arrangement in any way			0
’ @entity118 culture spokesman @entity118 said : ‘ the @entity1 should be squeaky clean about any commercial arrangements it enters into , particularly if the products might be seen on screen			1
’ in march , @entity3 made clear on its website that it has no advertising deal with the @entity1			0
the brand was founded in 1966 by @entity125 and @entity126 , two climbers and mountaineers from the @entity129			0
@entity130 : @entity20 , @entity28 and @entity29 spotted on screen frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear , they decided to import and sell their own			1
in 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products in a shop in @entity141 under the brand name ‘ @entity3 ’ – meaning ‘ mountain house ’ in @entity144			0
the firm still has its headquarters in @entity147			0
last night the @entity1 said : ‘ @entity3 is one of a number of suppliers of clothing used by the @entity1			0
it would be wrong to suggest the @entity1 ever agrees to clothing discounts in exchange for on - air promotion			0
’ the @entity155 said it had received no complaints on the issue			0
@entity3 said : ‘ no advertising or sponsorship deal exists between the @entity1 and @entity3 as this would break the @entity1 ’s editorial guidelines			0
‘ it is common practice for us to agree favourable trade terms for broadcasters such as the @entity1 , and for individual staff			0
’ the @entity167 : @entity1 newsreader @entity168 this is not the first time questions have been asked about the @entity1 ’s use of branded clothing on screen			1
there was a similar ‘ product placement ’ controversy in 2008 when several high - profile presenters made regular appearances in outdoor clothing showing @entity167 ’s logo			1
@entity181 editor @entity168 , business presenter @entity182 , @entity184 ’s @entity183 , @entity186 correspondent @entity185 and transport correspondent @entity187 were all criticised for wearing the distinctive @entity189 brand on camera			0
there was yet another controversy over @entity1 attire worn by staff at the @entity195 in @entity196 , @entity197			0
presenters including @entity199 were seen by millions wearing jackets bearing the letter @entity202 – the logo of @entity204 , one of the skiing world ’s most expensive brands .			1
