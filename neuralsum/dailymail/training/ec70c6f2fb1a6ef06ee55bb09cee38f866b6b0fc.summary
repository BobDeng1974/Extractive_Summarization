the horrifying video of the mass murder of @entity3 soldiers and an @entity5 aid worker is very different from other @entity7 propaganda films			1
posted sunday morning , it shows how the jihadists are seeking to heighten the disgust they provoke			1
security and military analysts believe this new tactic is a plot to lure @entity16 and other forces into a full - scale ground offensive is leaders think they can win			1
unmasked : the 16 followers of @entity19 prepare to behead the @entity3 soldiers they have held hostage			2
@entity22 from @entity23 is to the right of @entity19 , who is dressed in black with a balaclava the analysts reckon @entity28 is already reeling from air attacks that have stopped it taking the key @entity3 border town of @entity32			1
the murder of @entity5 aid worker @entity34 is not shown in the latest film – thought to feature @entity36 medical student @entity22 – and he does not deliver a final message as other hostages have			1
there is also no announcement of the name of the next victim			2
and for the first time the @entity44 militants give away their location – showing what is believed to be @entity48 , a town in northern @entity3 – in the video ’s background			1
@entity52 as a history lesson lasting 15 minutes and 53 seconds , the video – titled ‘ although the disbelievers dislike it ’ – starts with a documentary - style history of @entity7 since the invasion of @entity60 by western allies in 2003			1
it is in a different style from the rest of the footage , with more sophisticated graphics , and a treatment often used for major ‘ @entity69 ’ productions			0
there are scenes of bombings , summary executions and graphic video footage of dead civilians lying in the streets			1
it also shows what appears to be a dead child lying on a bed covered in blood			0
some of the footage of the bombings has not been seen before , though other scenes showing the summary killings of suspected @entity60 soldiers has			0
it is designed to incite supporters and operatives back in the @entity36 by justifying their actions and setting the stage for the next clip			1
still covered up : @entity19 has so far shown the world only his eyes the return of @entity95 with 16 followers filmed in the desert , the self - declared murderer , known as @entity19 , is seen leading a line of @entity3 troops to their deaths			1
a few paces behind him – and in the middle of a 16 - strong line of @entity108 jihadists said to be from over six countries – is the man believed to be @entity22 , a 20 - year - old from @entity23			1
like the other jihadists he is unmasked			1
@entity19 however keeps to his habit of showing only his eyes			0
@entity22 clutches the scruff of the neck of a @entity3 soldier , whose hands are bound with plastic ties			0
but while the other militants have expressionless faces – this young bearded man looks menacingly into the distance			1
taking the lead from @entity19 and those in the line before him , he brandishes a military knife taken from a box of weapons			0
the chilling sound of a blade being drawn can be heard above the sound of @entity44 music in the background			1
the prisoners are not wearing @entity136 - style orange jumpsuits , as in previous videos , but are dressed in black trousers and shirts			0
@entity19 , who has leather shoulder holsters for hand guns and a balaclava - style mask , takes centre stage			0
his appearance would seem to confirm his seniority and status as ‘ chief executioner ’ of @entity7			0
the man thought to be @entity22 stands to his right			0
@entity19 delivers his message to @entity5 and @entity36 before an eerie silence during which the camera zooms in on the faces of the killers , who remain impassive throughout			1
the scene then focuses on @entity19 – who begins to cut his prisoner ’s neck – quelling suspicion that he himself did not actually perform the previous beheadings			0
unlike the apparent murders of @entity16 hostages , in which the camera cuts away at the moment their throats are cut , the killings of the soldiers are shown in full			1
the camera zooms in on @entity19 and his victim who , in his final agonising moments , closes his eyes			2
@entity19 then looks threateningly into the camera while still holding the knife			0
the next clip shows a knife slicing into the necks of @entity3 soldiers followed by a stream of blood that turns the sand red			2
the image after that shows the soldiers ’ heads on top of their bent - over bodies			0
the mass beheading is a new departure because previous mass executions have been undertaken using guns			0
the fact that @entity19 ’s accomplices revealed their identities suggests they have no intention of returning to their home countries			0
a caption refers to them as ‘ hungry lions whose drink is blood and play is carnage ’			0
site of final battle with ‘ crusaders ’ as with the other clips , it is not clear when the final scene was actually filmed – though it is claimed to have been shot in @entity211 in northern @entity3			2
@entity19 ’s face is in shadow and it is hard to make out – but his mannerisms seem to be the same as in other videos			0
he talks with his now - familiar @entity219 accent			0
an image is shown of a man ’s head lying on the ground next to a man wearing desert boots – before the camera jumps to @entity19			2
mr @entity34 's beheading is not shown nor does he give a statement supporting @entity28 propaganda in the video while his death has not been verified , @entity19 says : ‘ this is @entity233 , a @entity5 citizen of your country			1
‘ @entity34 , who fought against the @entity236 in @entity60 while serving as a soldier under the @entity5 army , does n’t have much to say			1
his previous cellmates have already spoken on his behalf			0
’ mr @entity34 ’s beheading is not shown – nor does he give a statement spurting @entity28 propaganda			1
he may have refused to do so – or it may mark a change in tactics by the militants			2
a dateline on the video says it was shot in @entity211 , near @entity248 , a place cherished by @entity7 militants			1
according to one reading of @entity44 tradition , there will be a final battle there between good and evil – in this case @entity236 and @entity259 armies			2
the ‘ @entity261 ’ will eventually be destroyed , according to the reading			0
analysts said the change of location may also suggest that @entity19 and the hostages were being moved more frequently than normal to avoid coalition air strikes and to thwart rescue attempts			1
@entity268 ? unlike previous @entity7 beheading videos of @entity16 hostages , there was no reference to further deaths			0
in the earlier films @entity19 had warned of the next hostage to die , showing a clip of them on their knees and wearing an orange jumpsuit			2
@entity281 , the @entity36 journalist , is currently being held by @entity7 jihadists and has featured in several propaganda videos for the terror group he has used the prospect of another @entity16 death as a warning to the @entity5 and @entity36 against using military force in @entity60 and @entity3			2
@entity281 , the @entity36 journalist currently being held by the @entity7 , has featured in several propaganda videos but is yet to be named by his captors as the next to be killed .			0
