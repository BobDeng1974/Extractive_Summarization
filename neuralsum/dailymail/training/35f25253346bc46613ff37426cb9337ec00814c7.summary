by @entity0 new court documents in the latest battle over the vast fortune of @entity4 have claimed that the reclusive heiress was ' insane '			1
it is the first time that the insanity argument has been used during three years of feverish litigation over the @entity10 copper heiress ' estate			1
@entity11 died in may 2011 after spending the last two decades of her life living in a @entity14			1
the current court battle comes eight months after @entity11 's distant relatives - many of whom she had never met - won a $ 34.5million settlement in a separate legal fight over her two contesting wills			1
in a new court battle over the late @entity4 's $ 300million fortune , executors of her will have claimed that the reclusive heiress was ' insane ' now the executors of her estate are going after $ 105million in gifts that @entity11 gave to doctors and employees in her last 20 years , claiming that she did not know what she was doing			1
lawyers for @entity33 , where @entity11 lived for 20 years , said the insanity claim was ' a measure of their desperation ' , according to court papers seen by the @entity38			2
however the executors ' lawyer @entity39 said his clients simply want to show that the elderly lady was ' incapacitated ' , according to the @entity38			0
according to court papers , mr @entity39 claimed that when @entity11 moved into the hospital in 1991 , she was an ' eccentric recluse ' living in a dirty bathrobe and weighed just 75lb			0

@entity11 was the daughter of copper magnate senator @entity11			0
after losing her father , then her 16 - year - old sister to meningitis and a failed marriage , she withdrew from public life			2
she spent decades out of the public eye , designing doll houses and painting exquisite works of art. it was announced in march that @entity62 director @entity61 had bought the film rights to @entity11 's bizarre life , following the book ' @entity66 : the mysterious life of @entity4 and the spending of a @entity69 ' by @entity71 - winning journalist @entity70			1
miss @entity4 owned apartments at @entity73 in @entity74 , pictured , which took up an entire floor			2
despite this home , she lived in hospitals for 20 years despite owning properties on @entity73 and in @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity11 elected to live in @entity33 hospital for her last two decades			2
she met only with close friends , advisers and a nurse			0
beautiful : @entity4 retreated from public life when she was still a young woman			1
when she passed away , she was estimated to have a $ 300 million fortune just before @entity11 's death , distant relatives began questioning how her lawyer and accountant were handling her affairs - particularly after a will cut them out - and a criminal investigation was launched			1
the relatives also argued that she had given hefty gifts to her advisers , doctors and carers , suggesting that they had manipulated her - but they argued that she was simply giving generously to the people in her life			1
the argument was settled in september and the relatives - many of whom had never even met @entity11 - walked away with the largest payout , while her devoted nurse was left with nothing			2
more recently , prosecutors failed to find evidence of criminal conduct towards her , instead discovering that @entity11 's extravagant gifts were made in her own steady handwriting or with her written authorization			2
no criminal charges were filed against attorney @entity114 and accountant @entity115 , who all along denied any wrongdoing , and the investigation closed earlier this year			0
the investigation , carried out by two detectives and a forensic accountant , found that @entity11 's extravagant gifts were made in her own steady handwriting or with her written authorization			1
documents and testimony also showed that @entity11 was not kept from her relatives , @entity124 reported , but instead made her own decisions about whom to speak with in person or by phone			0

but a settlement last year ruled that they were not to receive the huge sums of money left to them by @entity11			0
heiress : @entity4 , pictured , inherited her fortune from her industrialist father , @entity11 , right the settlement combined elements from the two contradictory wills			1
the family - many of whom @entity11 never even met - came out as the winners , receiving $ 34 million while her private nurse of 20 years , @entity151 , was left with nothing			1
@entity151 , an immigrant from the @entity154 who worked 12 hours a day , seven days a week for @entity11 as she lived in @entity14 hospitals , had originally been given $ 30 million in @entity11 's final will			1
@entity151 had also been given $ 30 million in gifts throughout @entity11 's life			1
a separate deal ordered her to pay $ 5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general 's office deemed them excessive			2
however , the settlement stopped @entity11 's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts			0
while the @entity114 and @entity115 missed out on their payouts , the settlement also disposed of all potential legal claims against the pair , in relation to mistakes they allegedly made - such as failing to video her signing the will , and failing to claim gift tax returns for seven years .			0
