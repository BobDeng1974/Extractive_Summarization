by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 survived another scrap to beat @entity4 6 - 2 , 6 - 7 6 - 4 in the third round of the @entity6			1
in her first night session match against @entity9 two days ago , seventh seed @entity2 was pushed all the way and it was no different this time			1
there is no doubting the mental toughness of the 20 - year - old @entity14 , though , and she showed it once again despite looking in big trouble in the third set			2
@entity2 , who next plays 17th seed @entity30 , said : ' i feel like i pulled myself together at the very , very end tonight			1
' she got a lot of balls back			2
she made me work for it			0
at the same time she would occasionally come to the net , mix things up			0
stretch : @entity2 chases down the ball as she battles hard to book her place in the fourth round focused : @entity4 pushed @entity2 hard but was defeated in a tight three - setter ' it was the kind of variety i have n't seen much of			1
generally most opponents do n't do that so it was a little different			0
' but i 'm just proud at least that i could battle			0
even if it 's a little bit ugly or i do n't feel great , i can still pull it out , which made me happy			0

@entity2 beat @entity4 6 - 2 , 6 - 7 ( 2 - 7 ) , 6 - 4
the @entity14 no 7 seed battled hard to reach the fourth round at @entity56
@entity2 next plays no 17 seed @entity30 on *monday*
