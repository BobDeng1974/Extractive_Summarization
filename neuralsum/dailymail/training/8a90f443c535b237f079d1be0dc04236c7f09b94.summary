by @entity0 tax shelter : a court has ruled that @entity3 used an so - called investment company in order to avoid tax @entity3 and fellow @entity10 members invested more than £ 20million in a massive tax avoidance scheme , it was reported last night			1
the x factor judge , @entity13 , @entity14 and their manager @entity15 invested £ 66million into @entity16 , which styled itself as a music - industry investment scheme			1
but a court ruled yesterday that it was in fact an artificial tax shelter for the super-rich			1
the band members are now likely to face repaying £ 20million to @entity23 , according to @entity24			1
for years , @entity25 has been trying to shut down @entity16 , which claims to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘ creative and artistic material and taxable profits ’			1
in 2012 , it was revealed that the three take that members had invested £ 26million into an @entity34 partnership			2
it is claimed the musicians were able to avoid tax on about £ 63 million from world tours and cd sales			0
they were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £ 480million to 62 partnerships			0
but a tax judge found that 51 of the @entity34 partnerships , which were formed between 2004 and 2010 , had n’t made any profit - despite investigating in a range of musicians including @entity47			0
according to @entity24 , judge @entity48 said : ‘ icebreaker is , and was known and understood by all concerned to be , a tax avoidance scheme			0
‘ the aim was to secure [ tax ] relief for members , and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing			0
’ he added : ‘ no serious or even moderately sophisticated investor , genuinely seeking a profit ... would rationally have chosen an @entity34 partnership			0
bandmates : @entity3 ( centre ) as well as @entity13 ( right ) and @entity14 ( second from left ) used the scheme			1
there is no suggestion that either @entity67 or @entity68 , also pictured , were involved ‘ the predominant purpose of entering the scheme was " to achieve a tax saving "			2
’ a spokesman for @entity25 said : ‘ @entity23 has put in place generous reliefs to support genuine business investment and our tax reliefs for the creative industries work well , enabling the @entity80 ’s world - class film , television and video production companies to compete on the global stage			2
‘ but we will not tolerate abuse of the system by people trying to dodge their tax obligations			0
@entity23 will continue to challenge in the courts and anyone who engages in tax avoidance schemes risks not only the high cost of these schemes but also lay themselves open to penalties and , potentially , prosecution			0
’ in 2012 , lawyers representing @entity3 , @entity14 , @entity13 , and mr @entity15 confirmed they were investors in the partnerships , but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax - avoidance schemes			1
they added that their clients paid significant amounts of tax			0
there is no suggestion that the other members of @entity10 , @entity67 and @entity68 , were investors			2
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ this decision puts valuable funding for the @entity80 ’s independent music industry in jeopardy			1

@entity3 , as well as bandmates @entity13 and @entity14 used scheme
@entity10 manager @entity15 also invested in @entity16
the company styled itself as an investor in the music industry
