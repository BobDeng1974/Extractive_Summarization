by @entity0 @entity1 is ' in no hurry ' to hire a new swing coach - as he has yet to swing a club during his latest injury lay - off			1
the former world number one 's last @entity7 action came on august 3 , when he withdrew after eight holes of his final round at the @entity11 having aggravated a back problem			1
since then his focus has solely been on strength work , meaning the search for @entity18 's replacement - following their split three weeks ago - can wait			1
@entity19 has n't featured for more than a month after aggravating a back problem ' am i looking for a new coach ? as of right now , no , i 'm not , ' @entity1 told reporters at a press conference to announce a new sponsor for his tournament , the @entity26 , where he is due to make his comeback in early december			1
' i 'm in no hurry to look for one			0
right now i 'm just trying to get physically better , stronger , faster , more explosive			0
' i 've just been shadow swinging without a club , but i 've been busting my butt in the gym pretty hard			0
@entity1 parted company with swing coach @entity18 three weeks ago ' i 've got my strength back , which is nice			1
now the next goal is to get my explosiveness and my fast twitch ( muscles ) going , and that 's the next phase of my training			0
' @entity1 admits that with hindsight , he returned too soon at june 's @entity41 , where he missed the cut			2
four of his seven tour appearances this season resulted in missed cuts or withdrawals , while his best finish was 25th at the @entity48			0
@entity1 has been working hard in the gym in a bid to get back in action ' would i like to play ? there 's no doubt , yes , ' he said			1
' i miss competing , i miss playing , i miss being out here with the guys , i miss all that , but i 'm not physically ready for it yet			0
' as far as coming back this summer too soon , i felt good enough to do it and the only unfortunate part is i could n't maintain the conditioning			2
' as the tournament would wear on , i would get more and more fatigued and tired and i was n't as explosive			2

former world number one split from @entity18 three weeks ago
@entity1 is concentrating his efforts on getting back to *fitness*
@entity68 has n't featured since august 3 due to back *complaint*
