‘ how can i trust a nurse to help me with my pain if she is too clueless to know that when i ’m sick in bed the last thing i want to hear is ‘ if you go down to the canteen can you get me two bacon sarnies ? ’ - that ’s the last thing you want to hear when you are in bed			0
” @entity126 , the former president of the @entity7 said : ‘ the source of most complaints i ever received as a manager were about nurses talking too loud and even listening to the radio at night , waking patients up for observations , which sometimes you have to do but sometimes you do n’t , even waking patients up to give them sleeping tablets			2
