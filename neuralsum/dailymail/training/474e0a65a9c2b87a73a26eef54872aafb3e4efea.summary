by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 put a smile back on the face of the game on friday as the pair turned in a glorious exhibition at the @entity8			1
@entity9 shot a fabulous 64 but still could n’t keep pace with the man he beat at @entity12 , as @entity13 renaissance artist @entity2 created something of a masterpiece with an amazing course record - equalling 61 , including seven birdies in a row to finish			1
@entity2 also birdied the 10th to come home in a remarkable 27 strokes			1
‘ i have been fortunate enough to have some low rounds in my career but none as low as this , ’ said the 34 year old			0
‘ this was the best one of all			0
’ delighted : @entity2 leads the way after a course record - equalling 61 indefinite : @entity30 will miss the season 's final major and @entity33 after admitting he needs professional help in form : @entity36 is seeking his third win in just four starts after another impressive display the second round had begun amidst the murky clamour created by the spectacular downfall of @entity30 , who announced on thursday he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the game to tackle some ‘ personal challenges			1
’ all that disappeared to the back of the mind thanks largely to @entity1 and @entity2 but also to two more wonderful ball strikers – @entity52 and @entity53			1
what a third round we have in prospect on saturday , with @entity36 joining @entity1 and @entity2 in the final threeball after following up his opening 65 with a 67			1
@entity2 leads by three from @entity36 with @entity1 four off the pace and @entity53 five behind			1
@entity1 was playing in the group behind @entity2 and admitted he had gained motivation watching the latter hole putt after putt			1
‘ i was playing really well but thinking to myself if i did n’t make a few birdies i was going to be too far behind him going into the weekend , ’ said the 25 year old			0
‘ fortunately i was able to do that and it was great to finish with two in a row			0
’ as for @entity36 , he is in prime position to notch his third win in his last four starts			2
‘ you scored well but did n’t play well , ’ was the verdict of @entity36 ’s coach @entity73 after the first round			2
this time , it was the other way round as @entity36 struck the ball so well even a three under par effort felt scant reward			2
‘ i guess it all evens itself out in the end , ’ he said			0
@entity83 is seven off the pace and just outside the top 20 after a nondescript 71			0
in contention : @entity1 lies in joint third after a impressive display so far back on track : @entity83 is slowly but steadily getting his game back on track after back surgery all of which did much to erase the shock created by @entity30 with his stunning announcement on thursday			1
on the practice ground and outside the ropes at @entity98 , on websites and all over social media , they ’re certain they know what caused the sad demise of @entity30			1
players get a three month suspension for a violation of the tour ’s anti-doping policy concerning recreational drug use			0
with @entity30 declaring himself ineligible even at this stage for the @entity33 at the end of september , people have drawn their own conclusions			1
there remains no hard facts , however			0
the @entity117 name players guilty of taking performance - enhancing drugs but not recreational , while @entity30 ’s statement simply fuelled the speculation			1
whatever the truth , there will no doubt be many who feel the need to condemn a man whose party lifestyle appears to have caught up with him			0
the prevailing mood here , however , remains an obvious sadness at the fall of someone who appeared to have everything ; someone so gilded that even fellow members of the elite speak in awed tones about his gifts			0
no golfer aged 30 or under has won more times on the @entity117 than @entity30			2
‘ when @entity30 is on his game and firing on all cylinders , there really is n’t an awful lot that most of the rest of us can do to stop him , ’ said @entity140 , following a vain pursuit at the @entity143 tournament in @entity144 last november			2
@entity151 – no relation - could n’t stop shaking his head in sympathy when asked about his namesake			2
‘ it stinks , ’ he said , repeatedly			0
the other @entity30 ’s name has been discreetly removed already from the @entity33 qualification list , with brash @entity160 @entity159 now moving into the last available slot			2
he is in good shape to move up still further following rounds of 67 and 68			0
@entity164 and @entity165 are both in the top 20 as they seek to cement their @entity33 place but struggling @entity169 trio @entity168 , @entity170 and @entity171 are well off the pace once more after rounds of 71 , 70 and 73 respectively .			0

@entity2 leads after a course record - equalling 61 to lead by three shots at the half - way stage
@entity52 , seeking a third *victory* in four starts , is a shot behind
@entity1 lies joint third after a fabulous 64
the second round began amid the murky clamour created by @entity30 , who announced he is taking a break from golf
