@entity0 said @entity2 's pixie cut was the worst hairstyle of the year his most famous client has worn her hair in a barely - changing short style for decades			1
but the @entity8 ’s hairdresser is adamant that most women in their mid- 40s and beyond are making a big mistake by having their hair cut short in a bid to turn back the clock			1
@entity0 , @entity8 ’s personal stylist for the past 15 years , says women of a certain age believe they are too old for tousled tresses			1
yet many celebrities would have lost their sex appeal years ago had they chopped their hair short , he claims			1
‘ women in their mid- 40s and 50s at one time would rush to cut their hair off			1
it was like they became wives , mothers , a “ certain age ” and they cut it all off , ’ he said			2
‘ but actually hundreds of women , as long as their hair is healthy and in good condition , look much better with soft long hair			1
’ he chose two actresses who are still glamorous at 62 to illustrate his point			0
‘ @entity33 for example is a woman of a certain age who has worked having lovely long hair , ’ he said			1
‘ if she had had it all cut off at the age of 40 she would have lost her sex appeal years ago			1
@entity41 is another example of this , she has beautiful hair			2
‘ @entity47 hair , sexy curls are all in at the moment			0
women are finally moving away from straight , sleek hair and embracing movement and texture and it is much better			2
‘ women are choosing to go for the @entity56 sex - kitten look and i think they are finding it very empowering – being sexy is the new power - dressing			0
’ mr @entity0 derided @entity2 ’s boyish pixie crop as the worst haircut of the past year			1
the @entity62 actress ditched her long locks for her @entity65 - winning role as fantine in the film musical @entity68			0
‘ it really does n’t do a lot for her features , ’ mr @entity0 said			2
‘ much like @entity73 , her mouth is far too big for a short haircut			0
’ however , he does n’t mind short styles on most younger women and welcomes the influence of @entity78 and the latest film version of @entity80			0
‘ the waved bob of the 1920s is really coming back , the flapper look … the bob has become glamorous again , which is really exciting , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity78 is so popular and young women are looking at these once old - fashioned looks and are thinking actually that look is cool , that look is sexy			0
five or six years ago everyone was attacking their hair with straightening irons			2
mr @entity0 , 51 , is dicreet when it comes to disclosing the secrets behind the @entity8 's hairstyle			1
he praised @entity33 for keep her lon locks at the age of 62 it is lovely that young girls are embracing the curl			0
’ mr @entity0 , 51 , who started his hairdressing career in his native @entity101 as a 16 - year - old trainee , says x factor judge @entity103 has the nicest hair he has cut			1
‘ it ’s all hers and it has never been coloured			0
just beautiful to work with			0
’ but , not surprisingly , he adds : ‘ of all my clients , the @entity8 is by far my favourite , she has wonderful hair			1
’ he tends the @entity8 ’s hair twice a week – often travelling the country to places such as the @entity114 in @entity115 to do so			1
