middle - aged people who have a drink a day cut their chances of developing heart failure in later life by a fifth , claim researchers			1
a @entity8 study of nearly 15,000 people found drinking up to seven drinks a week is linked with a 20 per cent lower risk of men developing heart failure in the future when compared to people who did not drink at all			1
there was a 16 per cent cut in risk for women drinkers , says a report in the @entity20			0
more than 700,000 @entity30 over the age of 45 live with heart failure , which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body			1
around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it			0
heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue , breathlessness , increased heart rate and swollen ankles , and it can lead to serious complications			1
a team led by dr @entity45 , professor of medicine at @entity47 , analysed data from 14,629 people aged between 45 - 64 years between 1987 and 1989			2
the volunteers were questioned about alcohol consumption at regular intervals			1
during the 25 - year follow - up period 1,271 men and 1,237 women developed heart failure			1
the lowest rate of heart failures occurred in those drinking up to 7 drinks per week and the highest rate was among former drinkers			2
a drink was defined as containing 14g of alcohol , equivalent to approximately one small ( 125ml ) glass of wine , just over half a pint or a third of a litre of beer , and less than one shot of liquor such as whisky or vodka			0
former drinkers had the highest risk of developing heart failure â€“ up to 19 per cent increased risk compared to abstainers			1
there was an increased risk of death of 47 per cent for men and 89 per cent of women who reported consuming 21 or more drinks a week at the start of the study			2
previous research has found drinking modest amounts of alcohol protects heart health , but this is the first study to look in depth at heart failure professor @entity45 said : ' these findings suggest that drinking alcohol in moderation does not contribute to an increased risk of heart failure and may even be protective			1
' however , heavy alcohol use is certainly a risk factor for deaths from any cause			0
' the people who were classified as former drinkers at the start of the study had a higher risk of developing heart failure and of death from any cause when compared with abstainers			1
' this could be related to the reasons why they had stopped drinking in the first place , for instance because they had already developed health problems that might have made them more likely to go on to develop heart failure			2
' government guidelines recommend men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day			0
women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day			0
@entity126 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity127 , said ' some studies have shown drinking small amounts of alcohol may have some benefits for your heart , but it 's not just your heart health you have to think about			0
' drinking alcohol can increase your risk of liver disease and some cancers , and excess amounts can also lead to cardiovascular disease			0
' there are much safer and healthier ways to protect your heart like exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet , so there 's no reason to start drinking if you do n't already			0
anyone who is concerned about their alcohol intake should contact their gp			0
