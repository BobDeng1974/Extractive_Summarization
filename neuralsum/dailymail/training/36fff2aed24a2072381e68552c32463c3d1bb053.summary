' the storm prompted the @entity61 for @entity62 to write an open letter to the @entity10 legend			1
self - mockery : the four time @entity10 champion has since uploaded a photo comparing himself to @entity78 executive director @entity132 said there were more than 180 forms of the condition and many left sufferers with missing teeth and unable to sweat			0

others , however , defended him saying he may not have known @entity16 had a disability dear mr. @entity220 , all of us at the @entity61 for @entity62 ( @entity222 ) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family , @entity16 , who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia			1
individuals affected by these rare , genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance , which others may consider “ different			2
” bullying is never acceptable and we , as a nation , have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying			0
however , to be called out on a celebrity ’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible			2
we applaud @entity16 for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “ hug do n’t judge			2
” mr. @entity220 , we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change			0
the ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair , teeth , skin , glands and nails in men , women and children of all races and ethnic groups			2
of the more than 180 different syndromes , x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( @entity266 ) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth , the inability to perspire , sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections			1
symptoms can range from mild to severe , but in all cases present a variety of challenges			0
we invite you to attend our @entity276 , july 23 - 26 in @entity277 , @entity278 , and meet families from around the world who , like @entity16 , are affected by ectodermal dysplasias			2
you will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas , daunting physical challenges , and financially draining dental procedures they ’re up against			0
you might want to consider making something positive come from this			0
consider giving @entity16 the gift of a smile , one that others would not make fun of			2
give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride			0
we are urging our @entity222 community to use this opportunity to raise awareness , to make positive change , and to support @entity16 ’s “ hug do n’t judge ” campaign ( # hugdontjudge )			1
we encourage you to do the same			0
let ’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias			0
together , we have the power to make life better for the people it affects			0
