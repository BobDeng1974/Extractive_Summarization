click here for your ultimate stats guide , including @entity4 's wonder strike well , no one can say they did n’t get value for money			1
on a night when @entity11 ’s £ 10million record signing @entity9 announced his arrival in @entity14 football with an excellent goal , he was upstaged by @entity16 ’s new £ 12m man @entity4			1
it did not end there			2
@entity11 ’s other debutant @entity19 , who left @entity20 under something of a cloud two weeks ago to move to @entity23 , appeared to have stolen the headlines when he scored against his old club but @entity26 , another of @entity16 ’s new signings from @entity28 , saw his shot helped over the line by the hapless @entity32			1
it was difficult to know who was happier with a point from an entertaining contest between two managers who are not always known for their open style of play			2
@entity41 @entity40 ( hidden from view ) is mobbed by his new @entity11 team - mates after giving his side a 2 - 1 lead at the @entity46 @entity4 - signed by @entity16 for £ 12million this summer - hammers home a wonder strike from 25 yards on his debut @entity50 's 20 - yard strike took just 0.7 seconds to travel from his boot to the goal at a speed of 70.1mph @entity4 wheels away in celebration with @entity56 after scoring to bring @entity16 level at 1 - 1 five minutes into the second half @entity59 : @entity11 2 - 2 @entity16 - click here to see how @entity50 scored for the @entity16 , and more from @entity62 's brilliant interactive service @entity11 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity63 5 ; @entity64 6.5 , @entity32 5.5 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6 ; @entity67 6 , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 5.5 ( @entity70 58 ) ; @entity71 7 ( @entity72 79 ) ; @entity9 7.5 ( @entity73 79 ) , @entity74 6			1

@entity102 : @entity9 @entity103 even set up @entity16 with a midfield diamond formation that helped produce the kind of flowing football the club ’s owners and supporters have demanded of him for so long			1
‘ i ’m sure me and @entity103 will have a beer now and say “ hey , we do n’t normally play like that ” , ’ admitted @entity11 boss @entity110			2
yet , amazingly , we had to wait half an hour for the first shot in anger , a wayward effort from @entity56 that flew well wide			1
it was the trigger for a frenetic end to the first half that saw @entity50 and @entity26 go close before @entity9 struck			1
the @entity120 had only secured a work permit and trained with his new teammates for the first time over the weekend before @entity110 took the decision to start him			2
when @entity126 knocked the ball back to @entity64 on the right and his cross picked out @entity9 , the former @entity131 striker got up ahead of @entity84 to send a fantastic header swerving inside @entity81 ’s left - hand post			1
‘ he was full of life in training and that was what made my mind up , so i thought just throw him in , ’ said @entity110			0
‘ but if you saw him now poor kid ! ‘ he has been waiting for two weeks			0
he has been away in @entity141 and @entity142 and then stuck in @entity143 for the past couple of days waiting for his passport			0
we picked up his work permit on friday and flew to @entity148 to get him			0
’ @entity9 almost had another goal with a cracking effort off the underside of the bar — @entity74 was offside when he headed in from the rebound — but it was nothing compared to @entity50 ’s wonder strike in the 50th minute			1
@entity50 appeared to have run out of options when he carried the ball infield and came to a halt 25 yards from goal			1
there was almost no backlift at all as he took aim and sent a spectacular effort flying beyond @entity63 and into the top corner			2
under - fire @entity11 owner @entity166 ( centre ) , who has put the club up for sale , watches on from the stands at the @entity46 @entity9 rises to beat @entity84 to the ball and head home the opening goal for @entity11 @entity120 international @entity9 wheels away in celebration after scoring on his debut at the @entity46 @entity9 looks happy to be in the limelight after his goal sparked the contest in to life mins @entity182 @entity11 total 109.28 67.9 @entity126 90 11.6 7.2 @entity74 90 11.3 7.0 @entity67 90 10.7 6.6 @entity16 total 110.5 68.7 @entity87 90 11.6 7.2 @entity56 90 11.1 6.9 @entity88 90 11.1 6.9 data courtesy of the @entity184 , the @entity185 of the @entity186 the @entity189 @entity188 star had already made two @entity186 appearances since arriving from @entity192 club @entity191 , but this was his first start and he marked the occasion with his first goal			1
and what a goal it was			0
‘ everyone can see why we bought him with that strike , ’ said @entity103			0
‘ it was one of the best we ’ll see this season			0
the power and the accuracy of the shot was past @entity63 before he could even move			2
it stunned the whole stadium , it was that good			0
’ with 25 minutes to go , @entity19 of all people struck against his old club			2
worse still for @entity16 , it came from their own throw - in from @entity213			2
his delivery was aimed towards @entity88 but @entity71 touched it away from him and closed in on goal			0
there was still plenty to do as @entity84 tried to block his path but the man from @entity41 could not have placed it any better , curling the ball around the defender and just inside the post			0
did @entity103 see that one coming from his old player ? ‘ yeah , ’ he said			0
‘ what sickened me most was the way we gifted him the ball , but it would have sickened me more if it had been the winner			0
’ thankfully for @entity103 , he only had to wait three minutes for the equaliser			2
@entity56 played a pass into @entity26 whose his first - time shot squirmed past @entity63 and @entity32 could only help it into the goal			1
there was still time for @entity65 to rescue @entity11 when he intercepted @entity50 ’s downward header as it flew goalwards and chested it against the bar			1
‘ if that had gone in i was up and ready to start dancing , ’ said @entity103			0
‘ and that is n’t a pleasant sight			0
’ @entity50 announces his arrival in the @entity186 with @entity16 in the ascendency in the second half @entity11 manager @entity110 is an upset with a referee decision as @entity103 looks on from the dug out @entity71 curls home from just inside the box to regain the lead for @entity11 after a defensive error by @entity16 @entity26 's potshot at goal from a tight angle has @entity11 goalkeeper @entity63 and captain @entity32 in a muddle the game is all square just minutes after @entity11 had re-taken the lead as the ball trickles over the line off @entity32 ' leg new @entity11 signing @entity72 came on late in the second - half for his first appearance since joining from @entity263 on loan @entity74 clears off the line for @entity11 after the ball beats goalkeeper @entity63			1

@entity9 scored on his @entity11 debut after 39 minutes with a powerful header
£ 12m @entity16 signing @entity4 equalised just after half - time with a brilliant effort from 25 yards
@entity40 - who joined @entity11 from @entity16 on *deadline* day - then put his new side in front
@entity16 equalised soon after when @entity26 's shot was *inadvertently* *diverted* in by @entity32
@entity65 cleared off the line in stoppage time from @entity50 to ensure @entity11 held on for a draw
