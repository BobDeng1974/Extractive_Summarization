by @entity1 reporter published : 05:21 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 14 august 2013 naked models are turned into works of art by a painter who spends hours blending their bodies into urban street scenes			2
@entity9 , 33 , uses body paint to camouflage the women against graffiti and murals on walls and buildings			1
the invisible artwork regularly catches passers - by off guard , who fail to notice the people hiding behind the paint as she painstakingly copies every detail onto the model			0
@entity9 's range of work sees her mask a number of models into portraits , urban tags or abstract pieces			2
@entity9 , from @entity31 , @entity48 , said : ' my work started when i was essentially asked to get on stage at a rock concert in my underwear and get body painted - that was my first exposure to body paint			1
' and i have been working on them ever since			0
' i was working with urban art as a visual artist and wanted to keep making work with my friends when i transitioned to body paint as my medium , so i started doing these camouflage collaborations			1
' inspiration is a little tricky at times - it can be instant or can take a period of time and contemplation to develop a concept			0
behind the scenes : the artist is assisted as she attempts to blend a model into a mural popular : @entity9 ( pictured right ) has a line of volunteer models as her reputation in the city grows introduction : the artist first used body paint when she was at a rock concert and was painted on stage concealed : only the model 's feet are instantly noticeable after she is blended into the intricate design ' other times i just walk on the street , see a mural i fall in love with , and start painting a model into it			1
' graffiti is created and destroyed so fast on the street , that i find i 've had to be responsive to it			0
' @entity9 's work is done on the streets of her hometown in @entity31			2
and willing volunteers are often easy to come by as her popularity grows in the trendy art scene of the @entity106 city			0
@entity9 said : ' i was working with urban art as a visual artist and wanted to keep making work with my friends when i transitioned to body paint as my medium , so i started doing these camouflage collaborations			1
' my camo paintings take about one or two hours each			0
in general , body paintings take from four to eight hours , but painting on the street live gives me a specific energy that is heightened			0
' on the look out : @entity9 said she has to be ' responsive ' to street art as it changes or is destroyed so quickly hidden : the camouflage is so convincing that passers - by are shocked when they realise a model is there one - off : some of the artist 's pieces can never be reproduced because the murals change			1
