by @entity0 the world 's last uncontacted tribes could be monitored using satellites and online service , researcher have said			1
a @entity7 team has already used @entity9 images to assess the demographic health of a village of isolated people on the border between @entity14 and @entity15			1
they say mapping sites could hold the key to remotely keeping an eye on the tribes without contacting them			0
members of an uncontacted tribe in the @entity14 state of @entity25 , as seen from satellite images			1
the researchers were able to find the area on google maps and estimate the population			0
@entity33 , including the @entity34 , harbors most of the last indigenous societies that have limited contact with the outside world			0
studying these tribes , located deep within @entity40 rainforests , gives scientists a glimpse at what tribal cultures may have been like before the arrival of @entity46			2
researchers at the @entity48 used satellite images to assess the demographic health of one particular village of isolated people on the border between @entity14 and @entity15			1
remote surveillance is the only method to safely track uncontacted indigenous societies and may offer information that can improve their chances for long - term survival , the team claim			2
they used @entity9 satellite imagery to estimate the area of the fields and the size of the village belonging to the tribe			1
the team was also able to ascertain as the living area of the tribeâ € ™ s temporary housing , and compared their data with similar estimates for 71 other @entity14 indigenous communities have have been monitored in the past			2
' we found that the estimated population of the village is no more than 40 people , ' @entity75 , who led the study , said			0
pictures from @entity82 of what they say are uncontacted @entity85 seen from a @entity14 government 's observation aircraft in the @entity14 @entity40			1
researchers are now using @entity9 to estimate populations the @entity85 appear be to healthy and could be running from @entity15 due to a invasion of their lands by loggers			2
' a small , isolated village like this one faces an imminent threat of extinction			0
however , forced contact from the outside world is ill - advised , so a non-invasive means of monitoring the tribe is recommended			0
' a remote surveillance program using satellite images taken periodically of this group would help track the movements and demographic health of the population without disrupting their lives			1
surveillance also can help locate isolated villages , track patterns of migration over time , and inform and create boundaries or buffer zones that would allow tribes to stay isolated , @entity75 said			0
' close to 100 uncontacted groups are thought to currently exist in @entity118			1
' @entity119 , cattle ranching , illegal mining , and outside colonization threaten their existence			0
' most of these tribes are swidden horticulturalists and so their slash - and - burn fields are observable in satellite images			2
' but , they do move around , sometimes in response to external threats , and this movement requires constant monitoring if there is to be any hope of preserving their habitat and culture			0

100 uncontacted tribes are *believed* to exist in the @entity40
@entity7 team has already used @entity9 images to assess the demographic health of a village on the border between @entity14 and @entity15
exact location being kept *secret* to keep tribe secure
