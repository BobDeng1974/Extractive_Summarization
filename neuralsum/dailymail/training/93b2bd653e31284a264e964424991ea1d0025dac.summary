by @entity0 last updated at 12:02 pm on 5th january 2012 thousands more women may be at risk after it emerged that suspect @entity5 breast implants were repackaged and sold under a second name			1
industry experts estimate that some 5,000 @entity9 women have @entity11 m - implants , described as simply being @entity12 with a different branding			1
last night , plastic surgeons and patients said it was vital that women know that it is not just the @entity5 name that is suspect			2
fresh fears : the @entity5 breast implants at the centre of a safety storm were also repackaged and sold under a different name one woman told how she believed she had breast cancer after a gel that leaked from a split m - implant left her in excruciating pain and created a lump the size of a golf ball			1
the warning came as health secretary @entity35 said he would consider setting up a national register for breast implants and called on private clinics to pay for any @entity5 implants that have leaked to be removed			1
the government , however , still refuses to advise mass removal			0
health secretary @entity35 said he would consider setting up a national register for breast implants yesterday , as the medical watchdog continued to collect data on rupture rates , the @entity45 chain pledged to follow mr @entity35 ’s advice			0
and , in a slightly unusual move , an @entity51 clinic offered to remove all @entity5 implants from @entity9 women willing to pay to fly to @entity55			1
until now , the implant scandal was widely thought to be limited to those made by @entity58 in @entity59 and filled with a gel believed to have been made for mattresses			2
but industry experts believe that while some 45,000 @entity9 women have @entity5 implants , thousands more may have them without realising			1
a @entity66 implant manufacturer called @entity11 is believed to have had a long - standing agreement to buy implants from @entity5			1
they were then rebranded as m - implants but the contents remained the same			2
while they were not sold to @entity9 clinics , the @entity72 says many @entity9 women would have had them implanted when they travelled abroad to countries such as @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78 for cut - price operations			2
some 20,000 women a year go abroad for cosmetic surgery and breast enlargements are particularly popular			0
the @entity66 healthcare inspectorate banned the sale of both @entity5 and m - implants in the spring of 2010			1
' golf ball size swelling ' : @entity87 feared she had cancer - but instead the implant had ruptured @entity11 has gone bankrupt and could not be contacted for comment			1
but @entity91 , an investigative journalist who has been probing the implant scandal for two years believes some m - implants are still on sale			2
mr @entity91 , of the @entity96 medical news service , says there are reports of the implants being used in @entity100 as little as two months ago			0
@entity101 , a plastic surgeon advising the government on the scandal , said that any advice about @entity12 must also be extended to m - implants			2
mr @entity101 , a @entity72 member , said : ‘ those with m - implants should also seek advice			0
i would suggest they do not seek advice from the surgeon who put them in because i suspect they are probably not going to give the best advice			0
’ concern about @entity5 implants flared at the weekend when figures suggested a 7 per cent rupture rate for @entity9			1
mr @entity35 ordered a review of the data amid speculation he would order mass removal of the implants , which were among the cheapest on the market			0
the industry ’s own investigation has since claimed the figure to be much lower , at 1 to 2 per cent , and so ‘ within the industry standard ’			0
an expert panel of surgeons , officials and statisticians met with mr @entity35 yesterday			0
their recommendation is expected tomorrow , the deadline for clinics to submit their data			0
@entity72 says the implants are not fit to be in the human body and so should be removed , whatever the rupture rate .			0

45,000 women have @entity5 implants - but thousands more may have them under a different name
@entity66 implant manufacturer @entity11 thought to have a long - standing arrangement to buy @entity5 implants
