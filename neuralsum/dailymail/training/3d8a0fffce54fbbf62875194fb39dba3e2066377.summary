by @entity0 published : 13:17 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 15:48 est , 11 march 2014 a three - year - old - girl was run over and killed when a freak gust of wind blew her buggy into the path of a reversing van , an inquest heard			1
@entity9 died from severe head injuries after being hit by a delivery van just as her mother was about to take her to to nursery school			1
@entity14 dashed inside her home in @entity16 , south @entity17 , to check her gas meter , leaving @entity9 in her pushchair just outside the door			1
killed : @entity9 was on her way to nursery school when she was run over by a delivery van dashed inside : @entity9 's mother , @entity14 , left , submitted a statement to @entity26 describing the accident distraught : @entity14 was too upset to attend the inquest at @entity26 but then she heard an ‘ unusual ’ noise and ran out to discover the girl lying in the road			1
she scooped her up and screamed ‘ my child , my child ! ’ in grief before she desperately tried to give her daughter mouth - to - mouth after the collision on 25 march last year			0
ms @entity14 , 34 , was too distraught at her daughter ’s death to attend the inquest at @entity26 , which ruled that her daughter 's death was an accident			1
however , she submitted a statement , which began by telling how she was running late that morning			2
she decided to put @entity9 in a pushchair because it would be quicker and added : ‘ we got outside and i remembered i needed to check the gas meter to see how much credit i had			1
scene : the driver of the delivery van described how he felt only a ' touch ' when he came into contact with the pushchair ‘ i put the pushchair on the pavement and left it outside while i quickly went back in and checked , and left @entity9 sitting in the pushchair on the pavement immediately outside			1
‘ i did not put the brake on			0
i was only inside the flat for a few moments when i heard an unusual noise			2
i ca n’t explain the noise , i did n’t know what it was , but it got my attention and made me run outside			0
‘ when i got outside i found @entity9 and her pushchair			1
they were both lying on their left side fully in the road			2
distraught : @entity9 's father , @entity76 , pictured laying a tribute after her death , appeared in court today but was too upset to speak ‘ @entity9 was positioned as if she was still in it			1
the van was directly in front of them			2
‘ my immediate reaction was just to get @entity9 out of the road and pick her up			1
‘ i was running up and down the street and telling the people in the van to call an ambulance			2
’ ms @entity14 said she initially thought delivery driver @entity89 and his passenger @entity90 must have been speeding to hit her child			1
she said : ‘ i said “ why were you speeding , ” the woman said “ we were n’t			0
” ‘ i assumed they must have been because they had hit @entity9 but i did not see the van before the collision or the collision itself			1
’ the court heard the weather was ‘ exceptionally windy ’ and the road was in poor condition with potholes in the street			2
looking very emotional as he recounted the tragedy , mr @entity89 said : ‘ i started to reverse , it must have been only a second or two into the reverse when i felt what i said was a touch			0
it did n’t feel like a hit or a bump , it was a touch			0
‘ i felt that , knowing that the floor had potholes and rubble and things , before i carried on any further i stopped			0
’ mr @entity89 , who was marking his birthday on the day , added : ‘ i felt the touch and she just stepped out of the door			0
‘ i saw her running saying “ my child , my child ”			0
i was thinking , what child ? until she picked her up , and that ’s when i thought - her child			0
that ’s when i first caught sight of her			0
’ ms @entity90 , who broke down in tears as she listened to the evidence , told the inquest : ‘ i saw @entity9 in her pushchair outside her front door as he did a full lock to reverse			1
‘ he was looking behind and then the next minute @entity9 ’s mother came out screaming			1
we looked at each other in shock and then she picked the little girl up from the floor			0
’ @entity144 , a car crash investigator , told the court : ‘ it was extremely windy and the arrangement of the buildings created somewhat of a wind tunnel			1
‘ throughout the investigation there were a number of times when the wind picked up and pushed the buggy along the road			0
sympathies : mr @entity76 's gift joined others outside @entity9 's home in @entity16 @entity9 , pictured with mother @entity14 , died when her buggy was apparently blown in front of a van in loving memory : a floral tribute left by mr @entity76 in the wake of the accident although one of the van ’s mirrors was partly smashed , this would n’t have contributed to the accident because the pushchair was ‘ completely ’ in the driver ’s ‘ blind spot			1
’ he said the most likely scenario was that the buggy moved from the pavement into the road and ‘ fell face down			0
’ coroner dr @entity181 recorded a verdict of accidental death			2
addressing @entity9 ’s father @entity76 , a former boxer , who sat in the front row , the coroner said : ‘ obviously i ’m so very sorry you lost @entity9 in such sad circumstances			2
‘ its a great shame that the brake was n’t on the buggy , but whether that would have made any difference we do n’t know			0
‘ i ’m so sorry you lost your daughter in that way			0
my sympathies to all of her family , including her mother who i know is to upset to come today			0
’ mr @entity76 was too upset to speak as he left court .			2
