controversial : @entity0 installed the cameras as part of the in - car @entity4 app in 2014 car rental company @entity0 has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles			1
the controversial device was installed as part of the in - car navigation system and guide , neverlost 6 app , which was introduced in 2014			1
drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy , but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on			1
they also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming			1
the cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary			1
to start a conversation , the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature has n't been integrated into the system			1
@entity36 , a spokesman for @entity0 , told the @entity37 it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely			1
he added that there is ' nothing behind the lens ' and there is no timetable to connect the device			2
however some drivers who regularly rent from @entity0 have still expressed their concern at the camera 's presence			2
one customer wrote on the forum @entity50 : ' i am a regular renter from @entity0 ( @entity53 )			0
this week after the usual excessive wait for the @entity0 airport shuttle , i got into a rental car at @entity57			0
' i immediately noticed the new neverlost and i was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me			0
the system ca n't be turned off from what could tell			2
further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car			0
' i know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far			2
breach of privacy ? some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device , but the hire car firm said there is ' nothing behind the lens ' and the camera simply does n't work ' i find this to be completely unacceptable in fact , if i get another car from @entity0 with a camera in it , i will move our business from @entity0 completely			1
i influence car rentals of many others and i do n't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light			2
' given what @entity0 has invested in this system , i wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this			0
business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer			0
' the company told a @entity111 user who criticized the use of the lens : ' the camera in the @entity4 device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time			1
' mr @entity36 added that if any customer has any concerns with the device , they can simply switch to another car			0
only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside			0
it is not the first time in - car recording technology has caused a stir			1
last year @entity132 released a new corvette with a ' nanny cam ' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets			0
but @entity137 were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states .			0
