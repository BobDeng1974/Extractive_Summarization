undergraduates at @entity11 wanted to spend £ 200 on a picture of her majesty to celebrate the @entity14			1
but college members - whose alumni include the @entity18 ’s grandson @entity17 - voted against the portrait because it promoted elitism			1
student representative @entity22 defended the decision			1
he said : ' i think that some saw the portrait as potentially divisive			1
' the general feeling was that enough is already being done to commemorate @entity3 ’s @entity14			1
' another @entity28 student added : ' nearly £ 200 to support someone who was born into a certain family is not really economical use of money			1
' the royal family do nothing but sit on their backsides and wave at people			2
' they have never had to work in their lives and just live off their ancestor ’s money			2
' also , we have a lot of international students and it is not fair to show some kind of political allegiance they do not agree with			2
' only 17 students voted for the patriotic painting to be bought while 54 voted against			2
but the decision has angered student @entity54 , who proposed the patriotic motion			0
@entity56 : a student at another college called @entity28 members ' hypocrites ' for criticising the ' elitist ' monarchy he said : ' i proposed the motion as i felt in this jubilee year it was important to recognise the glorious service the @entity3 has given this country			1
' it was voted down mainly on the spurious contention that it would be divisive			0
' i feel very sad that on this issue @entity28 has shown itself to be woefully out of touch with the rest of the @entity76 population , 80 percent of whom currently support the monarchy			0
” another student , from nearby @entity79 , said : ' i could n’t believe it when i heard they had decided not to put up a portrait of the @entity3			0
' they have become a laughing stock of the university			0
' how they can have the audacity to say it was rejected because she is born into a privileged family is beyond me			0
' it is totally unpatriotic and very hypocritical considering the intake at @entity28			0
' i ’d say 90 percent of the students at that college are born into rich families and have spent their lives living off their parents			0
' shadow chancellor @entity97 graduated from the college in 1988 and former @entity100 president @entity99 was elected to an @entity101 in 1994			0
