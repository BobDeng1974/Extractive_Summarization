by @entity0 and @entity1 it is usually the incoming tide that spells the end for sandcastles			1
but this 13ft - high fortress , built to mark the 100 - day countdown to the @entity8 , did not even stand long enough to have the waves lapping at its walls			1
instead , after £ 5,000 was spent on building the castle over four painstaking days , it was knocked down – over health and safety fears			1
no sooner were the requisite publicity photos taken than a mechanical digger demolished it			1
@entity18 : children wave @entity20 on top of the giant sandcastle , which had been built on @entity24 beach in @entity25 to mark 100 days until the @entity8 at a cost of £ 5,000 organisers claimed keeping the castle on the beach in @entity24 , @entity25 , which will host @entity31 sailing events , would have meant hiring 24 - hour security staff in case it toppled over and trapped a child or people climbed on it			1
but locals described the castle , built by sand sculptor @entity39 and funded by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , as a waste of time and money			1
one likened last friday ’s demolition to a plotline from @entity46 , the @entity48 ’s satire on the preparations for the @entity8 , while another said : ‘ what a waste of money – £ 5,000 for a sandcastle that did n’t stay around for people to see			1
despair : the fort was knocked down almost as soon as it had been completed over fears it could topple onto someone , much to the anger of local residents and businesses , who branded it a waste of time and money ‘ if it was dangerous then why build it in the first place ? ’ a @entity40 spokesman said the decision to destroy the sandcastle was made jointly by @entity40 , the local council and mr @entity39 , explaining : ‘ the sandcastle was dismantled as a safety precaution straight after the photos were taken			1
' over-reaction ' : businesses , in particular , are ruing a missed opportunity to attract tourists to the area off the back of the giant structure farce : the circumstances surrounding the sandcastle could have come straight out of a storyline for @entity46 ( above ) , the @entity48 satirical comedy about incompetent @entity31 organisers the official motto for the @entity8 will be ' inspire a generation ! ' , organisers announced today			1
with the @entity90 just 100 days away , the slogan was officially unveiled at a ceremony at @entity92 by @entity40 ( @entity40 ) chairman @entity93 and chief executive @entity94			1
but having had nearly seven years to think of one , some may question whether it is the best they could have come up with			1
speaking at @entity97 today , @entity93 ( pictured above ) said : ' i am delighted to announce the motto inspire a generation			1
' it is everything we have been saying since we have started this extraordinary journey , not just since we got across the finish line in @entity106			2
' it is the heartbeat , the very dna of this organisation and a rallying cry for the athletes to come to the @entity113 to perform at their very best and inspire the world			2
' with 100 days to go to the start of the @entity90 , millions of people are getting ready to do the best work of their lives and welcome the world this summer			2
expectations are high and we wo n't disappoint			2
' ‘ our aim was to create an iconic photo opportunity for @entity24 and @entity124			1
’ the spokesman added : ‘ already we have seen this photograph used by people [ and ] publications worldwide and it has undoubtedly been a successful exercise			2
’ mr @entity39 completed the impressive project last friday morning , a few hours before photographers turned up to take pictures			2
within minutes of them leaving , a mechanical digger arrived on the beach at @entity24 - which will host all the @entity31 sailing events - and promptly demolished the castle in an hour			1
@entity137 , head of the @entity24 and @entity124 2012 operations team for @entity24 and @entity139 , justified its removal			1
he said : ' it was an organisational decision			2
' we took it down because it was constructed in a special way and we could n’t have just left it there in case it fell on a young child			2
we would have been criticised if that had been the case			2
' a council spokesman added : ' it was built to create a photo opportunity to mark 100 days to go to the @entity8			2
' to keep it there until the start of the @entity8 would have required additional security and presented a health and safety risk in that it was quite a big structure and it could have collapsed with a child playing on the beach near to it			1
' it could have been cordoned off but that would have required additional security to make sure there was no risk of people climbing on it			0
' sand artist mr @entity39 said : ' demolishing it was all part of the plan because there would have been health and safety issues			0
' people could have injured themselves on the council ’s land so there would be no way we could leave something like that			0
' the castle was paid for by the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , which is privately funded			0
locals today slammed the decision to demolish the castle			0
one resident said : ' if it was dangerous then why build it in the first place ? ' countdown begins : @entity31 officials and the media admire a large set of @entity194 , created with at least 20,000 flowers and plants in @entity92 today to also mark the 100 - day milestone @entity199 , owner of the @entity200 , ' it reminds me a bit like the programme @entity46 , except this has n’t been made up			1
' it was a great piece of work and we all went to see it during its short life			0
it ’s a shame that it has gone			0
' it sounds like health and safety has gone a bit over the top but i suppose they have their reasons for demolishing it			0
' @entity220 , of the the @entity221 , said : ' i thought the sandcastle was a good idea , i do n’t really understand why it was demolished			0
' it ’s a bit over-dramatic and i think health and safety has gone overboard			0
' just as the @entity24 sandcastle was being cleared away , construction of @entity230 's longest artificial beach was starting to take shape in @entity233			1
@entity234 will open near the @entity31 venue next month , with an @entity31 - size volleyball court and plans for a restaurant and live events stage catering for crowds of up to 5,000			0
the site is expected to be used during the @entity242 and for events during the @entity8			0
could this be the missing sandcastle ? @entity245 is piled up next to the @entity246 in @entity234 ready to form part of the longest artificial beach in @entity230 which will be used for events during the @entity8 underway : a digger landscaping an area near the @entity252 , where the beach will be located sands good : the beach will feature an @entity31 - sized volleyball court and possibly a restaurant ' value for money ' : culture secretary @entity259 ( above ) has defended accusations that the @entity8 have cost the taxpayer too much @entity31 leaders have defended the public expenditure on @entity8 after 64 per cent of poll respondents said taxpayers had paid too much towards the @entity90			1
@entity259 , the secretary of state for culture , media and sport , pointed out that a majority in the @entity48 poll - 55 per cent - also rated @entity8 as good value for money			0
@entity8 chairman @entity93 added the @entity8 have provided jobs and investment at a critical time in the economy			0
with 100 days to go to the start of the @entity90 , mr @entity259 said : ' the same poll said more than half of the respondents said the @entity8 would be good value for money			0
' if you ask people if they spent too much on their @entity288 shopping just after they have done the big shop just before christmas day a lot of people would say yes			0
' the right time to ask people if it has been worth it is after we have had the event			0
' lord @entity93 said he was not surprised by the poll results , but the @entity90 had already paid an economic dividend with between £ 6billion and £ 7billion going into the @entity113 construction industry and 42,000 people having worked directly or indirectly on the @entity299			0
he added : ' jobs have been safeguarded throughout the @entity113 particularly in some very challenged communities ' i ’m not particularly surprised ( at the poll ) , it ’s understandable given the world we live in - domestically and internationally people are focused on value for money			0
' but in the lead - up to the @entity90 and in the long haul of the legacy of the @entity90 i ’m confident we will be able to demonstrate far and away that this was a project that - i ’m still gratified that well over half the population believe it - this is value for money and there are tangible benefits in their communities			0
