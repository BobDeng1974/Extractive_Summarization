by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:32 est , 30 november 2013 a french businessman who realised his childhood dream to relocate to a desert island has been driven home by wild @entity8 creatures and unaffordable phone bills			2
@entity10 , 54 , had been getting increasingly frustrated with his stagnant life commuting from @entity12 to @entity13 every day to his office job as a publicist			1
last @entity16 , the sorry sight of distinctly un-merry @entity17 lugging presents through the station compelled him to finally take a leap			0
deserted : @entity10 , 54 , relocated his work as a publicist to one of @entity8 's 17,000 islands moving to one of @entity8 's 17,000 islands like @entity26 moved to @entity27 , mr @entity10 ' detoxed from modern life ' by scavenging for food , being in touch with nature , and having little to no contact with other human beings			1
his only companion was @entity35 , a dog borrowed from a @entity38 woman , to scare off the wildlife			1
he told @entity40 he wanted to be the first ' @entity41 ' to persuade @entity43 people to abandon the tiring , demoralising commute and work remotely			0
he added : ' i found myself in @entity46 in @entity13 just before @entity16 watching the continuous stream of people passing by			0
idyllic : he was bound by @entity8 law to keep the exact location of the 700x500 - metre island a secret ' @entity41 ' : @entity10 filmed his experiment testing if it was possible to work this far from the office ' they had this sad look on their faces , even though they were carrying @entity16 presents			1
it had long seemed to me absurd this travelling back and forth to offices			0
' my idea of going away had been growing for a while , but it was on that day , i decided to leave			0
' it took him six months - and numerous run - ins with the @entity8 government - to find the perfect uninhabited island for a six - week trial run			2
although he managed to persuade officials to let him go , he was ordered by law not to reveal the exact location of the hideaway , that is just 700 - by - 500 metres			0
finally , in october he set off - with just a tent , four solar panels , a phone , a laptop , rice and pasta for supplies			0
guard dog : @entity35 , a dog he borrowed from a @entity38 woman , helped scare off the wildlife isolated : @entity10 was banned from stating the exact location of the uninhabited island in the @entity92 every day he woke at 5am and went to bed at midnight			1
he would scavenge for vegetables on the island and fish in the sea before simply reclining to ' detox from modern life '			1
' those days , for me it was like being in quarantine , ' he told @entity103			0
' i used the time as a detox from modern life			1
' he told @entity108 : ' what gave me most joy was living - stripped bare - in the closest possible contact with nature			2
' however , it was not stress - free : his company had to publish two editions of @entity117			0
snakes : @entity10 was surrounded by @entity8 's wildlife ranging from small snakes to giant pythons rats : he said living on the island with pests such as rats for any more than 40 days would be too much to handle diary : he wrote a blog and made videos tracking his progress			1
he admitted he wo n't go out again he allowed himself 20 euros a day for internet to email his employees - and abandoned extortionate phone calls early on			0
but after completing his trial , mr @entity10 has conceded that he can not do it forever			2
although he claims the ' telecommuting ' experiment was a success , he told @entity43 broadcasters my @entity139 that the snakes and rats were intolerable - and fear of losing internet connection was even worse			2
the biggest challenge was lack of human contact			1
he said : ' telecommuting really works but doing everything virtually has its limits			0
working from distance might be doable , but nothing can replace human contact			1

@entity10 , 54 , moved to a 700x500 - metre island for 40 days
he scavenged for vegetables and fish , and ' detoxed from modern life '
only companion was a ' rented ' dog that scared off wildlife for him
says lack of human contact and fear of losing web signal was unbearable
