by the end of @entity2 the army had identified 80,000 cases of a new condition they termed as ' shell shock '			1
scientists have been perplexed by the symptoms - that include anxiety , facial tics as well as terrible nightmares - ever since but , after more than a century of research , the mystery may have been solved			0
experts now believe that a honeycomb pattern of broken nerve fibres in the brains of veterans that survived improvised explosive devices ( @entity21 ) attacks , is responsible for the condition officially termed as blast neurotrauma			1
by the end of @entity2 , the army had identified 80,000 soldiers suffering from shell shock and after 100 years , scientists have now discovered a honeycomb pattern of broken nerve fibres in the brains of veterans that seem to show the brain injury caused by war			1
@entity35 soldiers in the trenches are pictured researchers at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , conducted autopsies on @entity43 combat veterans who survived blasts in @entity45 and @entity46 , but later died of other causes			1
they discovered that they had the same kind of brain injury – a distinctive honeycomb pattern of broken and swollen nerve fibres throughout critical brain regions , including those that control decision making , memory and reasoning			1
the pattern is different from brain damage caused by car crashes , drug overdoses or collision sports			1
@entity62 , a professor of pathology , neurology , and psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the university , explained that survivable blasts may cause hidden brain injuries that play a role in the psychological and social problems some veterans face after coming home			1

here , a soldier breaks down in @entity46 after learning his friend was killed , and another ( centre ) suffers from burns caused by a blast millions of soldiers suffered psychological trauma as a result of their war experiences			2
symptoms ranged from anxiety and facial tics , to stomach cramps , as well as terrible nightmares and insomnia , as they relived scenes of slaughter			0
by the end of @entity2 , the army had dealt with 80,000 cases of shell shock , which was first recognised in 1917			2
war neuroses accounted for one in seven men discharged from the @entity103			0
at the beginning of the war , scientists believed that the condition was caused by physical injuries to the nerves , but the man who coined the phrase , medical officer @entity112 , realised that some soldiers suffered from shell shock who had not been in the front lines			1
he , and others , began to think that psychological factors were responsible for breakdowns			0
if doctors thought shell shock was caused by nerve damage , they treated soldiers with massage , rest , exercise regimes and electric shock treatments , but if they thought it was psychological , hypnosis and rest was prescribed			1
‘ this is the first time the tools of modern pathology have been used to look at a 100 - year - old problem : the lingering effect of blasts on the brain , ’ he said			0
molecular probes were used to reveal details in the brains that they examined , according to the study , published in @entity142			0
senior author , professor @entity62 , said : ‘ we identified a pattern of tiny wounds , or lesions , that we think may be the signature of blast injury			2
’ ‘ the location and extent of these lesions may help explain why some veterans who survive ied attacks have problems putting their lives back together			1
’ soldiers have struggled with bomb - induced brain damage , which was dubbed shell shock , since 1914 , when @entity162 and @entity163 forces bombarded each other for months on end			1
the condition is now known as blast neurotrauma and still affects some soldiers who served in @entity46 and @entity45 , where the use of ieds were widespread			0
doctors treating ied survivors ‘ often see depression , anxiety , post-traumatic stress , and substance abuse or adjustment disorders , ’ said professor @entity62 ‘ life is very difficult for some of these veterans and it ’s important to understand that at least a portion of these difficulties may have a neurological foundation			0
’ in the study , the scientists used a molecular marker to track a protein called @entity189 that normally travels from one nerve cell to another via a long nerve fibre , or axon			0
when axons are broken by an injury , app and other proteins accumulate at the breaks , causing swelling			0
the study revealed that bulbs on the nerve fibres of the soldiers were medium - sized , unlike those of people who died in car crashes or drug overdoes			1
near the damaged axons , specialised cells , called microglia , that are involved in brain inflammation , were revealed			0

war poets @entity217 ( left ) and @entity218 ( right ) both suffered from the condition , which @entity218 described as ' minds the @entity221 have ravished ' in the brains of people killed in car accidents , the swellings were large and bulb - shaped , while in cases of methadone overdose , these axonal swellings were small			0
in the brains of four of the five veterans who survived wartime blast injuries , the axonal bulbs were medium - sized and usually arrayed in a honeycomb pattern near blood vessels			1
‘ we did not see that pattern in other types of brain injury , ’ professor @entity62 said			2
the veterans ’ brains did not show signs of the neurodegenerative disease known as punch - drunk syndrome , which is caused by multiple concussions			2
but near the damaged axons , specialised cells , called microglia , that are involved in brain inflammation , were revealed			0
dr @entity62 explained : ‘ in brains that had been exposed to blasts , we see microglial cells right next to these unusual axonal abnormalities			0
the presence of these cells suggests the veterans who overdosed had pre-existing brain injuries			2
lesions may be fragments of nerve fibres that broke at the time of the blast and slowly deteriorated , or may have been weakened by the blast and broken by some later accident like a concussion or drug overdose , the study says			1

three of the men died of methadone overdoses , one of a gunshot wound to the head and one of multiple organ failure			0
the researchers compared the veterans ’ brains to those of 24 people who died of a range of causes , including motor vehicle crashes , opiate overdoses and heart attacks			1

researchers at @entity38 in @entity39 have identified the brain injury responsible for shell shock
they discovered a honeycomb pattern of broken nerve fibres in the brains of veterans that survived ied attacks but dies of other causes
pattern *'s* distinct from damage caused by car crashes and drug overdoses
survivable blasts may cause hidden brain injuries responsible for psychological and social problems some veterans face
