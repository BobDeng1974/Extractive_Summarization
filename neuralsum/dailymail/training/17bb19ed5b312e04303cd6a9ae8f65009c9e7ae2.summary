by @entity0 no time to make friends ? now you can hire then online feeling lonely ? fancy a natter about your day ? for the price of a bottle of wine you can now hire someone to be your friend			1
you may think it sounds like the ultimate in desperation , but over half a million members of @entity13 would disagree			2
with @entity16 ’s single - person households at 9.5 million and growing , it ’s no wonder the friendship website , originally launched in the @entity18 , is gaining traction in the @entity16			1
the site facilitates connections between members and friends			2
for $ 24.95 per month ( £ 15 ) members have hundreds and thousands of potential friends at their fingertips			1
‘ friends ’ create a @entity28 profile for free and charge members between £ 5 - 30 for the privilege of their company			1
the website clearly states no physical contact is allowed between any members and friends			0
in the @entity16 alone there are 26,000 users with and over half a million other members in almost every country round the globe			1
the platonic friendship business is also booming in @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity18			1
and unsurprisingly big cities like @entity46 and @entity47 are hubs of rental activity			0
members choose a friend by pursuing the many profiles , where the friends describe themselves and post pictures , and then send their preferred companion a message			1
the friend then decides whether they want to meet the member and hence the platonic liaison begins			0
the website boasts that people are using @entity62 for all kinds of activities including shopping , going to the park , sharing poetry , sightseeing , baking and even finding a wingman or woman to help pick up a date			0
the site is also used by the elderly or people whose disabilities impinge on their social lives , who are looking for company			0
mainly though , it ’s just about hanging out			0
thirty - two - year - old @entity79 , one of the site ’s friends up for hire , recently told the @entity84 newspaper : ‘ i can see why it ’s popular because it ’s so hard to meet people in @entity46 and @entity88 people are really awkward			1
’ the website states that no physical contact between members and friends is allowed but suggests ' hanging out ' and ' sightseeing ' as potential activities the @entity96 - born ‘ friend ’ , who charges herself out at £ 20 an hour adds : ‘ if i get on well with someone and they become a friend , i would n’t ask to be paid			1
’ the friendship concept started in @entity102 , where it catered to divorced or widowed parents looking for fake spouses to hire for social occasions			1
the idea caught the attention of @entity109 from @entity110 , who saw the potential for the rent a friend concept elsewhere in the world			0
‘ family structure is a very big part of society in @entity102 , and the companies were offering “ fill in ” family members , ’ explains @entity109			2
‘ if there was a divorce , death , or situation in which a parent was not available , one could hire someone to pretend to be that family member			0
‘ if a child had a school activity in which the parents needed to attend , it was common for a single parent to hire a spouse to fill in for the school event			2
‘ after reading about the companies in @entity102 , i realized that there were n't any companies that were catering to the friend market elsewhere			0
’ ‘ there were thousands of dating websites , but no websites where you could hire a local platonic friend , ’ he adds			2
after doing some market research , @entity109 realised the potential for the untapped market .			0
