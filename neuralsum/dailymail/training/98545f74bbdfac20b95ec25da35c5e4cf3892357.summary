by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 13:42 est , 8 january 2014 dividing wine into the good and the barely drinkable is nothing new , according to a recent archaeological discovery			2
an ancient wine label that dates from the days of @entity7 , reveals the contents of a jar was lousy plonk intended for slaves and sheds new light on society at the time			1
the label is thought to be the most ancient @entity17 engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in @entity19 to date			1
the word on the pitcher reads ' yayin ' or wine and he believes it should read ' in the year [ ¿ ] @entity23 , wine , part , m [ ¿ ] ' in a form of ancient @entity17 , according to professor @entity27 a rare trove of coins and jewellery was found buried near @entity31 in @entity19 in september 2013			1
it included 36 gold coins dating back to the seventh century with images of @entity36 emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a @entity39 , @entity38 made from a @entity41 's horn and a @entity43 scroll			0
a 3,000 - year - old earthenware jug was found - which is the same one that has now been deciphered			0
the discovery was made in the ruins of a @entity36 public structure located in the @entity49 - between the city of @entity51 and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the @entity53			2
@entity31 is considered one of the most religious sites in @entity19 and is where two biblical @entity57 temples once stood			1
it is also a site of @entity62 interest site known as the @entity63 as - @entity64 , or @entity31			2
this area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in @entity19 dating back to the 10th century @entity68 , possibly built by @entity7			1
the inscription is eight letters long and was engraved on a large clay pitcher in the second half of the 10th century @entity68 in biblical times , which was used to store cheap wine			1
it was found in the @entity49 area of the city , south of @entity31 , as part of a dig by the @entity80 at the @entity81			1
some experts previously claimed it was written in an ancient near @entity85 language , but @entity27 from the department of @entity87 at @entity88 believes it is actually a form of ancient @entity17			1
a word on the pitcher reads ‘ yayin ’ or wine and he believes the whole inscription should read ‘ in the year [ … ] @entity23 , wine , part , m [ … ] ’			0
professor @entity27 explained the first missing word ends with ‘ mem , ’ which is the final part of the word for the 20th or 30th year of the kingdom and effectively dates the wine			2
the middle portion or ‘ wine , part ’ indicates the type of wine contained in the jar and in the @entity109 language from northern @entity110 , a similar word to ' yayin ' means the lowest quality of wine			0
the final letter has been cut off from a longer word , but professor @entity116 thinks it could indicate where the wine came from			0
the discovery was made in the ruins of a @entity36 public structure located in the @entity49 between the city of @entity51 and the southern wall of the @entity53 , ( pictured )			0
this area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall of @entity19 dating back to the 10th century @entity68 , possibly built by @entity7 professor @entity27 told @entity128 : ‘ this wine was n’t served to @entity7 ’s emissaries , or in the temple , but apparently was for the slave construction workers who worked in the area			1
’ archaeologists already know that poor quality wine was drunk by soldiers and slave builders and believe that it was stored in large vessels that did not keep it particularly fresh , like the one found in the dig six months ago			2
professor @entity27 thinks the carving was produced after @entity7 had built the first temple , his palaces and city walls			0
the earthenware jar that is now known to contain cheap wine , was found in the @entity49 archaeological area in @entity19 , where other treasures , including a number of byzantine coins have been discovered the find sheds light on the @entity156 kingdom ’s sophisticated society , where many people were thought to be literate , taxes were collected and builders recruited and bought to @entity19 to build palaces and other infrastructure , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity163 on @entity19			1
some historians dispute information gleaned from the @entity166 that @entity19 was an important city , but supporters of the @entity156 accounts , including professor @entity27 , believe the inscription supports stories that tell of complicated administrative systems and a strictly hierarchical society			2
‘ scribes that could write administrative texts could also write literary and historiographic texts and this has very important implications for the study of the @entity166 and understanding the history of @entity181 in the biblical period , ’ he added			0
dr @entity183 , a lecturer in @entity166 and the @entity184 , from @entity185 told @entity186 : ‘ the inscription is written in what is variously called “ @entity188 ” or “ late @entity190 ” script			0
a 10cm medallion etched with a @entity39 , @entity38 made from a ram 's horn and a @entity43 scroll , ( pictured ) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label			0
however , the medallion dates from the @entity199 , unlike the older wine container the language is probably an early form of @entity17 , but it could be a closely related dialect spoken in @entity19 in the 10th century			1
’ he explained that at the time the inscription was made , the way words were written had not been agreed upon so some people wrote from left to right ( like @entity208 ) while others wrote in the opposite direction , like with modern @entity17 and @entity211			0
while professor @entity27 has interpreted the inscription from right to left , another academic , professor @entity212 has read it in the opposite way , but has not arrived upon a clear meaning			0
‘ irrespective of what the reading of the inscription is , it attests to someone writing @entity17 ( or a closely related language ) in the 10th century in @entity19 , probably for administrative reasons , ’ he said			1
‘ professor @entity27 suggests that this indicates that the inscription was made by some royal administration ( something like an early civil service ) and i believe that he is probably correct with that			0

the label dates from second half of the @entity231 and was discovered in the @entity49 area of @entity19 , south of @entity31
it is thought to be the most ancient @entity17 engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in the area so far
historians believe the type of cheap wine held in the containers would have been drunk by slaves and soldiers
