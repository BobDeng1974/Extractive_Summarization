a frail pensioner who was snatched from a care home by his concerned family and flown to @entity3 to be cared for by his daughter died just five months after she was jailed by the @entity5			1
@entity6 , 80 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , suffered from dementia and was first placed in a care home in 2009 while recovering from a bout of tuberculosis			1
however his daughter @entity14 , 52 , who was living in @entity3 at the time , had promised her father she would never allow him to be put into care and became frustrated with the situation			1
in the following years , until his death in january 2013 , she fought with the authorities to free him from the care home and even ended up imprisoned for six weeks under the secret @entity5			1
details surrounding the case have now come to light during a three - day inquest to determine the circumstances leading up to mr @entity6 ' death			2
an inquest into the death of @entity6 , 80 , ( right ) , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has heard how his daughter @entity14 , 52 ( left ) , was jailed for taking him out of a care home and to her @entity3 home in 2009 @entity14 told the hearing how she was desperate to free her father from the first care home because she claims it was an ' awful place for him to be ' and that he thought about taking his own life while there			1
the property developer arranged for the former painter and decorator to be moved to a nearby privately - run residential home after just two months , but said her father was so miserable that he would try to escape by fleeing on a bus or changing his clothes to disguise himself			0
she desperately wanted to take her father to her home in @entity3 , where she believed he would enjoy better quality of life and recuperate			2
however , she found out from the authorities that she had no influence over her father 's care without getting power of attorney over his affairs			0
she tried to obtain power of attorney but was told she would need up to £ 15,000 in legal fees			0
her father was later moved to another @entity8 care home in november 2010 , but mr @entity6 apparently hated it just as much as the other homes			1
@entity14 said : ' he was depressed there			0
' the final straw came on christmas day 2010 when @entity14 visited her father but was told she was only allowed one hour with him , supervised by staff			2
she said she called her three brothers , @entity64 , 55 , @entity65 , 54 , and @entity66 , 49 , who lived near their father and visited him regularly , and between them they hatched a plan to free him			0
the following day , on @entity72 2010 , the three men went to the care home , got their father out of the fire door , took him for a meal and then called @entity14			1
she then took him to her home in @entity3 , where he remained for 13 weeks			2
mr @entity6 ( above ) , who apparently hated being in care homes , died in hospital on january 8 , 2013 @entity14 said : ' two of my brothers got him out through the fire doors and they passed him to me and i took him to @entity3			1
it was the great escape			0
' however , the @entity5 – which was set up to safeguard vulnerable individuals – got wind of the situation and , when @entity14 flew back to the @entity89 with her father in february 2011 , the pair were prevented from returning to @entity3			2
@entity14 said : ' we flew back to sort his pension , only to find his money had been frozen			0
then the whole @entity5 thing started			0
' we were basically told that if we did not adhere to whatever decisions the @entity5 made , we could be jailed and our assets seized			0
' mr @entity6 was made the subject of a @entity98 order and taken into care again – at @entity100 care home in @entity102 , @entity103 - on - @entity104 - while @entity14 was forced to attend more than 20 court hearings and be subjected to several psychiatric evaluations			1
she was eventually jailed for six weeks in mid- 2012 at @entity108 women 's prison near @entity109 , which once housed @entity110 , girlfriend of @entity113 killer , @entity112			0
she became the first person to be jailed by the so - called ' secret court ' , the @entity5 , which settles the affairs of those deemed too ill to make their own decisions			0
her crime was contempt of court , for repeatedly breaking orders not to interfere with her father 's life at his care home			1
however , she believes her only crime was an act of compassion towards the father she loved and trying to keep a solemn promise to him to keep him out of care homes			1
following her release from prison , her father was moved to yet another care home in december 2012 before being taken into hospital for illness			1
he died weeks later on january 8 , 2013			2
@entity14 told the inquest today : ' my dad always said to me " do n't you ever put me in a care home " and i never forgot those words			1
' there was a fair amount of disagreement between myself , social services and the city council			0
' i thought it was better for him to be in the sunshine in @entity3 rather than in a care home			2
' they said he was too aggressive to be in the community and he had put his fist up			0
' @entity14 ( pictured ) told an inquest into her father 's death in @entity7 this week that ' there was a fair amount of disagreement between myself , social services and the city council '			0
she was jailed for six weeks @entity14 spent six weeks in @entity108 women 's prison near @entity109 ( pictured ) after the @entity5 ruled she had committed contempt of court			2
she said her only crime was compassion towards her father the jury was also told how @entity14 was happy for her father to be in a nursing home – which provides additional care – but was n't satisfied with him being in a care home			1
however , staff at the care home told the inquest that mr @entity6 was being cared for in the right place at the time			1
care worker @entity177 said : ' we were able to meet mr @entity6 's needs			0
at times he was aggressive but that could be very short - lived			0
