@entity0 is the latest athlete to come to the defense of @entity2 in the wake of his indictment on child abuse charges last week , saying he will discipline his own daughter in the same manner @entity2 disciplined his son			1
appearing today on the @entity12 show , the 29 - year - old @entity9 running back said @entity2 should never have been suspended from league play after getting in trouble for beating his son with a switch			1
he then added that if his daughter behaved inappropriately , she too would receive a punishment similar to the one @entity2 gave his son			2
' i have a one - year - old daughter , and i discipline her , ' he said during the interview			1
' i definitely will try to — will obviously not leave bruises or anything like that on her			0
but i definitely will discipline her harshly depending on what the situation is			0
' according to @entity39 2 @entity40 , @entity0 , who used to date @entity38 , was then asked if he would ever hit his daughter with a switch , to which he responded , ' i would possibly consider it , depending on what she did			2
' former lovers : @entity0 used to date reality star @entity38 ( both seen above ) @entity0 chalked up his opinion on the subject to the fact that he was disciplined in the same way as @entity2 's son when he was younger			2
this weekend , former @entity54 star @entity53 also defended @entity2 , saying the type of punishment the @entity58 star doled out is common among ' black parents in the @entity60			2
' one person who is not coming to @entity2 's defense however , is @entity64 quarterback @entity63 , who said earlier today he is ' embarrassed ' by his former team 's decision to allow @entity2 back on the field this weekend			1
' these are serious accusations , ' he told @entity70			0
' and the only way you ’re going to get the attention of an @entity58 player is to take away his paycheck and take him off the field			0
this is way above winning or losing a football game			0
i strongly disagree with the notion of playing him this week			0
' not fans : former @entity64 players @entity63 ( left ) and @entity84 ( center ) said they do not think @entity2 ( right ) should be allowed to play former @entity86 @entity84 also said that he felt @entity2 should not be playing when he appeared on @entity58 sunday this weekend			1
this all stems from an incident last may when @entity2 hit his four - year - old son so hard the child was left with bruises and open wounds			1
@entity2 faces up to two years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine if found guilty .			0

in an interview today , @entity0 defended @entity2 , saying he would discipline his one - year - old daughter the same way if she *misbehaved*
