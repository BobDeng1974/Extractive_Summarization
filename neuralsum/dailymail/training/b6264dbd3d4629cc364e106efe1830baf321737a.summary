a 4 - 1 victory over @entity19 at @entity20 was followed by two away draws , 1 - 1 at @entity21 and 0 - 0 at @entity9 , and three more points on matchday four would see @entity24 's men take a significant step towards the knockout stages			1
@entity2 defender @entity0 ( right ) is hopeful of making the @entity3 knockout stages @entity0 ( right ) chats with midfielder @entity28 ( left ) during training at @entity30 on wednesday @entity2 full - back @entity0 was part of the club 's run to the last 32 of the @entity3 in 2009 - 10			1

' but we are excited about where we are at at the moment			0

so that is the focus at the moment			0
' i think we may be better - equipped this time with the strength in depth we have got			2
@entity2 's players train ahead of their @entity15 clash at home to @entity60 side @entity9 on thursday @entity61 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) should start for the @entity2 under the floodlights at @entity20 ' we 're also probably in a tougher group than before in terms of the standard of the teams			1
' so , with that in mind , we have gotten ourselves into a good position , and we have two of the last three games at @entity20 , where we will expect to win			2
' although they have impressed in @entity10 , @entity2 made a shaky start to the season domestically , but their results have picked up of late			0
with the @entity2 having lost only one of their last seven games in all competitions , @entity0 feels the club are getting back to the levels they were at last term , when they came close to claiming @entity39 entry via the @entity83 , finishing fifth			1

i 've enjoyed being part of that for sure			0
