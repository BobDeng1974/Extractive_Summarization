by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 30 april 2013 in his role as the @entity4 ’s business editor , he does not usually have his emotions on show			1
but @entity7 has laid bare in heart - wrenching detail his grief at the death of his wife last year , revealing how he transcribed the handwritten manuscript of her last novel so that he could ‘ keep talking to her ’			1
in an article for @entity18 mr @entity7 has written candidly of the love he felt for his wife and how his family tried to deal with the effects of her battle with lung cancer			1
describing author @entity24 , with whom he first became friends as a teenager , as ‘ the woman i loved for most of my conscious life ’ , he praised the bravery and stoicism she showed in dealing with the illness			1
tragic death : @entity7 's wife @entity24 died from lung cancer in august last year aged just 51 mr @entity7 , 53 , said that through the ‘ sheer force of her will ’ his wife had remained ‘ poised and beautiful ’ despite the ‘ relentless ’ treatment and ‘ terrible shocks and emergencies ’ that came with the disease			1
he said his wife had worked on the book , @entity43 , until her illness had become ‘ excruciating and wholly incapacitating ’			2
he revealed that he did not know the work had been completed until he started reading her ‘ handwriting as familiar as my own ’ on the page and ‘ hearing her voice in my head ’			2
he described it as an ‘ exquisite work ’ which was ‘ more - or-less perfect ’			0
set in 1946 , the book has been described as a gripping murder story which highlights a ‘ post-war world of disillusionment , bitterness and emotional disturbance ’			0
mr @entity7 began to transcribe it a few days after his wife died last september at the age of 51			1
it will be published on thursday			0
he said : ‘ my motive was selfish : i wanted to keep talking to her			0
the tears could not be staunched as i read , deciphered and typed			0
’ he added : ‘ here she was , all hope lost of reprieve from the lethal cancer , reflecting on what it is like to know that death awaits on the morrow			2
’ when he read the manuscript , he marvelled ‘ at her victory over devastating circumstance ’			2
devastated : the @entity4 's political editor transcribed his late wife 's manuscript because he wanted ' to keep talking to her ' mr @entity7 said that while the book was a ‘ jewel ’ in its own right , the fact that @entity84 wrote it after receiving her ‘ death sentence ’ made it even more precious to him			1
he recalled movingly how , last august , a consultant oncologist revealed that nothing more could be done to help his wife other than ‘ take the edge off ’ her suffering			2
he said : ‘ it was almost exactly five years to the day after @entity91 – who is probably the only person i know who has never smoked a cigarette – was diagnosed with lung cancer			1
in the ensuing years , she never despaired or resorted to self - pity , even as the cancer spread			2
‘ the cycle of surgery , body - racking chemicals and radiation was relentless			0
life became punctuated by terrible shocks and emergencies			0
yet those who met her at pretty much any point in this ordeal encountered the @entity91 they had always known : solicitous , supportive , witty , insightful , unselfish			0
’ mr @entity7 said the priority was that their two boys – @entity111 , the son he had with @entity84 , and @entity113 , her son from her first marriage – were not continually being asked about their mother ’s health , and that his wife ‘ just got on with living ’			1
in fact , mr @entity7 said , there were ‘ wonderful years ’ earlier in her illness when the disease did not ‘ haunt ’ them but made them focus on the important things , such as family , work , ‘ friends , beauty and fun ’			1
@entity7 , left , has given a frank interview about losing his wife in this week 's @entity18 but he admitted that once his wife had got to the point of finishing her final novel , the cancer was more like ‘ a monster laying waste to our family ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity91 was being turned into an invalid , in almost unimaginable pain most of the time			0
for her , what was perhaps worse was that she was being robbed of her ability to take care of those she loved			0
’ but he said there had been ‘ an almost moral imperative not to be ground down by circumstances , even if those circumstances are an express train thundering in our direction ’			0
in the article he talked about letters he had kept which she had sent him when they were studying at university more than 30 years ago , and when they were ‘ too - briefly a couple ’ before they were apart for 12 years			0
they rekindled their relationship after her first marriage ended			0
the @entity18 piece includes a letter from his ‘ beautiful ’ wife – who was a schoolfriend of mr @entity7 ’s sister – written when she was 18			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ she was the most brilliant , caring , humane and loving person i have met			1
i miss her all the time			0
