do you struggle to climb the stairs or walk up a hill ? now there ’s a website that will show if you really are old beyond your years – by calculating your true fitness age			1
by putting in simple measurements such as how much exercise you do , your waist measurement and resting heart rate , the website calculates how well your body delivers oxygen to the cells – a measurement called @entity16 by stating how much exercise you do , your waist measurement and resting heart rate , the website calculates how well your body delivers oxygen to the cells – a measurement called @entity16 max. the left picture shows the calculation for a sedentary , moderately overweight 40 - year - old woman			1
the right picture shows the result using @entity30 ' vital statistics the results can be somewhat terrifying - a sedentary , moderately overweight 40 - year - old woman could have a fitness age of 54 , for example			1
researchers at the @entity36 found that putting just five measurements - waist circumference ; resting heart rate ; frequency and intensity of exercise ; age ; and sex - into an programme helped them predict a person ’s vo2 max quite accurately			1
fitness age is basically how well the body functions physically – compared to how well it should work – given the person ’s age			2
it is also a strong indication of lifespan , and , while not perfect , is a ‘ rough estimate of cardiorespiratory fitness ’ , the researchers wrote in their paper , published in the journal @entity58 in @entity59			0
if you are super fit , it can take years off your life			0
@entity64 winner @entity30 is said to have a resting heart rate of 35			2
when the rest of his details are plugged in , he gets a fitness age of ' younger than 20 ' and a young fitness age is ' the single best predictor of current and future health ' , the lead study author , @entity72 , told @entity73			0
he and his team of researchers got 5,000 people aged between 20 and 90 to run on a treadmill to the point of exhaustion			0
fitness age is a key predictor of lifespan various measurements were taken from them - and these were used to build a picture of what ’s normal at certain ages			2
obviously , the nearer the fitness age is to your age , the better			0
if you get a fitness age of 40 , for example , then you have the ' typical , desirable ' fitness of a 40 - year - old , he says			1
or , ' a 70 - year - old man or woman who has the peak oxygen uptake of a 20 - year - old has a fitness age of 20 , ' says professor @entity72			1
so how do you calculate your fitness age ? the two main things you need are your waist circumference in centimetres and your resting heart rate			1
this can be calculated by taking your pulse for 30 seconds and then doubling it			0
add in your age , gender , intensity and frequency of exercise and the calculator will generate your fitness age			0
the results can provide a stern wake - up call			2
a 40 - year old woman with the average @entity119 woman ’s waist circumference of 34inches ( 86cm ) who rarely exercises and has a resting heart rate of 80bpm ( the average resting heart rate is between 60 and 80 beats per minute ) has a fitness age of 54			1
on the other hand , if you are super fit , it can take years off your life			0
@entity64 winner @entity30 is said to have a resting heart rate of 35 – and when the rest of his details are plugged in , he is given a fitness age of ‘ younger than 20 ’			2
