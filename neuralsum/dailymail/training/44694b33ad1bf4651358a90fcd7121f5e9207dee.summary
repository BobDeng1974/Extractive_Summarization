by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:13 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 10:23 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 today warned if @entity4 was put in the nation ’s driving seat it would repeat the mistakes of the past and drive the economy ‘ into the same wall ’			1
the prime minister took a swipe at the opposition , after @entity14 suggested he would borrow more and reinstate the 50p tax rate for highest earners even if it brought in no extra money			1
mr @entity3 warned increasing the tax rate from 45p may be ‘ politically convenient ’ but would be ‘ very , very bad for our economy ’			1
he denied that the deficit left by @entity4 was a problem and e even boasted that if he had his time in power again he would have spent even more money in some areas			0
mr @entity3 told @entity43 : ‘ you saw what @entity14 said yesterday , which as far as i can see was that if he had his time over again , he would probably spend even more			2
‘ i think these people who seem to have learnt absolutely nothing from what went wrong with our economy , that the problems were based on too much borrowing , too much spending , too much debt , and they ’re really saying : “ if you gave us the key to the car , we would drive it in exactly the same way into exactly the same wall ”			0
’ mr @entity3 later met small businesses including boat builder and restorer @entity65 at @entity66 in @entity67 , west @entity68 mr @entity3 later told a conference of the @entity70 in @entity68 that the @entity4 proposals may be ‘ politically convenient ’ but would be ‘ very , very bad for our economy ’			1
‘ we 've cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p			2
i think it was the right step to take			0
i always knew it would n't be particularly popular but i thought it was the right thing to do because i want to take steps in this country that are going to encourage investment , going to encourage jobs , going to encourage growth , going to encourage business to invest more , ’ said the pm			0
the plan to increase the top rate of tax sparked a ferocious response from business leaders , with 24 warning in a letter to the @entity88 it would ‘ put the economic recovery at risk ’ and cost jobs			0
mr @entity3 added : ‘ from all the reaction i 've seen over the last 48 hours since @entity14 and @entity4 made their announcement , it only confirms me in that view			1
‘ we 've now got former @entity4 minister after former labour minister alongside a huge number of people in business to say that putting up the top rate of tax would cost jobs , cost investment , it is an anti-business , anti-enterprise , anti-growth measure			1
‘ i would argue that , just as i think what @entity107 and i did was right for the economy but politically difficult , @entity4 are now doing something that 's politically convenient but is very , very bad for our economy ’			2
mr @entity3 warned @entity4 was putting political point - scoring ahead of what was good for the economy but @entity4 's shadow chancellor @entity14 insisting taxing people earning more than £ 150,000 would help to bring down the deficit however , increasing the rate of tax rate for the highest earners is hugely popular with voters			1
mr @entity14 told @entity121 's @entity120 that the prime minister and chancellor @entity107 ‘ know in their heart of hearts they ca n't justify a massive tax cut to the richest when everybody else is worse off and paying more tax ’			1
‘ i think a fair approach to deficit reduction means those with the broadest shoulders need to bear their share of the burden , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n't think this is an anti-business move , i do n't think it 's bad for @entity138			0
i think it is a fair way to get the deficit down			0
’ asked if it was not already a fair share that the top 1 per cent of earners paid 29.8 per cent of all income tax , he said their proportion was so high ‘ because people are earning huge amounts of money , and rightly so in some cases ’			0
the 50p rate had raised £ 10 billion more than expected , he said , and the subsequent cut to 45p had cost the exchequer £ 3 billion and given top earners an average £ 10,000 tax cut .			2

prime minister claims opposition would borrow more to keep spending
@entity14 announced @entity4 would increase top tax rate from 45p to 50p
but @entity3 insists it is ' politically convenient ' but will not raise money
