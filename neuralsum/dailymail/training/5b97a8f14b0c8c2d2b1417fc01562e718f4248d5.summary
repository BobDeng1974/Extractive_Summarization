by @entity0 @entity1 is a popular with young people abusing aerosols in @entity4 one of @entity6 's top deodorant brands are looking into how they can reduce abuse of their aerosols after they became the favourite product for children as young as 10 to inhale in the @entity14			1
shops in @entity4 have removed @entity1 from their shelves and placed it behind the counter , where glue is also safely stored , after it was stolen by children trying to get high			1
@entity1 met with the @entity23 recently to discuss what can be done about the intoxicating hydrocarbon fumes from their product , @entity22 manager @entity21 told @entity27			1
the @entity4 - based youth service saw a sniffing outbreak involving hundreds of young people in the local area over the @entity31 weekend			1
shops in the @entity14 town saw their supplies of @entity1 depleted and youth workers found almost 200 empty cans of the product on a hill next to the town			1
' the town kids showed the bush kids how to sniff and they all headed up to @entity42 that weekend , ' mr @entity21 said			0
the majority of the kids involved were just 12 - years - old			0
mr @entity21 has lived in @entity4 for 30 years and previously successfully campaigned to have the abusive chemical found in petrol removed in the @entity14			1
he explained that kids stole the deodorant product from supermarkets and left the cans on the ground			2
@entity4 branches of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59 supermarkets at first agreed to remove the product from shelves for two weeks and have now extended that promise			1
mr @entity21 said ' the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal but that 's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous '			0
this is a file photo of children in the outback ' it does bad things to the nervous system			0
if you inhale it then it melts the fat around your nerves , ' he said			0
' in @entity4 it 's an ongoing problem ... the majority of sniffers here are aboriginal , but that 's because 30 per cent of the population here are indigenous			1
' the youth worker described how was in a supermarket with co-workers and noticed aerosol abusers wondering the aisles			1
outbreak : the @entity23 found children sniffing @entity1 on a hill in @entity4 ' they all headed up to @entity42 that weekend ' : around 200 cans of aerosols were abused by young people over the @entity31 weekend ' you can smell them from two or three metres off - they stink of @entity1 , ' he said			1
mr @entity21 believes education about the effect of sniffing aerosols does not work			0
he says the only thing that can stop the damage being done to children 's brains is to remove the supply of the product - just like they removed petrol that could be abused from the @entity14			1
' in the @entity14 we 've pretty much managed to eliminate petrol sniffing , ' he said			2
there used to be around 500 people sniffing petrol every day in the area			0
however , he said ' a subset of those 500 have gone on to seek other highs '			0
three young people ended up in hospital from sniffing aerosols in @entity4 , in april 2013 , and mr @entity21 warned of the ' brain damage ' the product can cause			1
' people seek it out if they have not other forms of drugs , ' he explained			0
he also blamed a government reduction on youth services in the area for a rise in aerosol abuse			2
there is now just one patrol on the streets , @entity136 , which usually picks up 70 children a night from the streets and takes them home			0
' the underlying problem is there is nothing for them to do now in @entity4			2
' the problem of aerosol abuse is not limited to the @entity14 , @entity145 in @entity146 has also reported trouble			1
and it is an issue with drug abusers around the world			0
among adolescents , inhalants are the second most widely used class of illicit drugs globally			0
more than 2 million children aged 12 - 17 years report using inhalants at least once in their lifetime			0
despite meeting with @entity1 , mr @entity21 said the company was very clear that changing their product to remove hydrocarbon fumes would be a ' difficult ' thing to do			2
mr @entity21 said @entity163 - @entity1 's parent company - had also agreed to visit @entity145 and assess the problem			1
a @entity166 spokesperson told @entity27 : ' @entity166 takes the abuse of aerosols seriously			2
' whilst new technologies may become available in the future , at present all available research that has been conducted by us and international organisations indicates that there is nâ€™t a viable technical or reformulation solution available that will address the issue			0
' we have been actively engaging with community groups , the police and government agencies on the issue and continue to explore other ways that we can help them to address solvent abuse in high risk areas			0
' all of our products are clearly labelled with guidelines detailing how to use aerosols safely and carry warning and caution statements regarding the misuse of the product			2
