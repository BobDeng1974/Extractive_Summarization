by @entity0 for @entity1 if @entity2 wanted to go quietly about his business , a tweet just before kick - off catapulted him firmly into the spotlight			1
as the @entity9 midfielder prepared for a game that was always going to provide a stern examination of @entity13 ’s credentials , @entity7 proclaimed to his 4.2million followers that he ‘ bet @ @entity16 has a big game today			2
convinced he ’s going to have a huge season			2
# quality ’ no pressure , then			0
coming just 48 hours after @entity21 complained that @entity2 had been put ‘ under too much pressure ’ , @entity7 ’s declaration guaranteed every step the 22 - year - old took would be scrutinised			1
the thing with @entity2 , though , is that we are still waiting for him to put it all together and run a game that matters , to dominate the type of contest in which @entity13 have habitually fallen short down the years			1
after another troubling evening on @entity40 , the wait goes on			0
if @entity13 were collectively abject for 83 minutes , failing to deal with @entity29 ’s slick passing and movement , @entity2 epitomised their shortcomings , not getting a look - in as @entity45 and @entity46 dominated			1
he set the tone for a petulant display as early as the fifth minute , complaining without justification to referee @entity50 after being outmuscled by the energetic @entity51			0
sulking and scowling , @entity2 shuffled around on the periphery and never looked to take charge			1
there have , of course , been well - documented fitness problems down the years but this effort — coming after a similarly anonymous showing against @entity59 in which he was substituted after an hour — never threatened to get out of first gear			0
why me ? the @entity9 midfielder argues with referee @entity50 at @entity63 on saturday evening crunch ! @entity64 attempts to take the ball off @entity2 before @entity13 's stirring comeback when @entity29 broke forward , @entity2 never had the pace to snap back and help @entity68 , while his occasionally forays into the opposition area lacked the wit or invention to cause problems			1
as his frustration mounted , it came as little surprise when he was booked for scything down @entity46			0
‘ i believe at the moment he should not respond ( to criticism ) , just focus on his game , ’ @entity21 argued			1
‘ at the moment i believe he should just focus on being fit , present and improve physically			0
if @entity2 can maintain his physical fitness , he can have a huge career			1
’ yet that is a big ‘ if ’			0
@entity2 has long been championed as the player who will provide the fantasy in @entity13 and @entity9 ’s midfield but , at present , his form merely adds weight to the acerbic comments @entity90 made about him last spring			2
when @entity21 has a full complement of midfielders , where does @entity2 fit in ? it should be pointed out that @entity2 — roundly booed by @entity29 supporters when @entity21 did the decent thing and ended his evening on 73 minutes — was not the only @entity13 player to let his manager down badly			1
how much did you pay ? @entity13 's new striker @entity100 looked hopelessly out of sorts on his own @entity102 started his first competitive game since winning the @entity104 with @entity105 but his meaningful contributions could be counted on the fingers of one hand			1
indeed , his loose ball enabled @entity29 to break and score their second goal before half - time			0
@entity100 , meanwhile , looked hopelessly out of sorts deployed as the lone front man			2
the experiment lasted 45 minutes , during which the @entity115 never had a shot and @entity29 ’s swagger nearly took the game away from @entity13			0
all , clearly , is still not right with the @entity120			0
at least the changes @entity21 made in the second half worked magnificently and the fighting spirit they showed to rescue the contest might be a trigger for them to have a big season			2
whether the same can be said for their lacklustre no 10 remains to be seen .			0

@entity21 's side came away from @entity63 with a point
late goals from @entity135 and @entity136 saved the day
@entity139 's team had gone two goals up
@entity2 and @entity100 both failed to impose themselves
