by @entity0 published : 19:12 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 19:13 est , 16 april 2013 justice minister @entity1 last night offered to look again at the issue of financial losses ministers engineered a partial climbdown over plans to reform @entity8 ’s libel laws last night amid claims that they are strangling free speech			1
the @entity11 said it would listen to complaints that the plans will allow big companies to silence their critics			1
mps rejected plans passed by the @entity18 which would have made it impossible for a company to sue unless they could show that they have suffered significant financial loss			1
but justice minister @entity1 last night offered to look again at the issue of financial losses - hinting that the government would bring in a fresh amendment in the @entity18 next week to strengthen the safeguards			1
she said : ‘ i am aware of the strength of the feeling that exists on this particular issue and whether or not there should be specific provision in the @entity32 requiring non-natural persons , trading for profit , to show substantial financial loss			1
‘ such bodies are likely in practise to show some actual or likely financial loss anyway			1
' but i can confirm that we are prepared to actively consider that aspect of the amendment further and we will of course listen very carefully to the views expressed in both houses			2
’ but ministers refused to give ground on another measure that critics say will gag the critics of big business			0
mps voted by own plans which would have made it impossible for companies working for the government to sue			2
it is already illegal for @entity58 departments and councils to sue			0
that means that firms who perform government contracts or fun facilities like prisons can use the law to stifle criticism of their use of public money			0
the @entity71 move to ban companies who do public work from suing was backed by the @entity75 despite the fact the party specifically supported the reforms in its manifesto			0
miss @entity1 said : ‘ although the provision focuses on criticisms in connection with the exercise of public functions , that criticism could of course have a wider impact on the reputations of a business more generally			1
’ shadow justice secretary @entity89 warning that move could ' chill free speech ' because people would feel threatened by the financial muscle of big businesses			2
shadow justice secretary @entity89 warning that move could ' chill free speech ' because people would feel threatened by the financial muscle of big businesses ' our objective is to reduce the chances of a corporation using its might as an intimidation tactic against free speech			2
' but we also believe that , just as local and central government , and their agencies , ca n’t take defamation proceedings against individuals , then private companies delivering public services should be similarly restricted			0
' just because a school , prison or hospital is run by a private company does n’t mean it should be insulated from public criticism			0
' @entity115 , of @entity116 , which had also demanded changes , said : ‘ we still need to see a hurdle for corporations to prevent bullying and a level playing field for those criticising public service providers			0
we hope that the @entity18 will insist on this next week			0

@entity11 said it would listen to complaints about plans
