@entity1 @entity0 has attacked fellow pop stars @entity3 and @entity4 for acting as ‘ submissive sex objects ’ in their videos			1
the 27 - year - old – dubbed the ‘ @entity9 ’ when she first shot to fame aged 11 – admitted she now regrets wearing revealing outfits as a teenage star			1
and she called for @entity16 radio chiefs to put a ‘ decency barrier ’ on what they play on their stations and avoid promoting tracks that are accompanied by offensive online pop videos			1
giving the annual @entity38 lecture at the @entity39 in @entity40 , the mother - of - two said she worried explicit music videos are aimed at increasingly younger viewers			2
in a thinly veiled attack on @entity32 – who first found fame as @entity45 on @entity46 – she said : ‘ the women generally filling these roles are very young , often previous child stars or @entity46 tweens who are simply interested in getting along in an industry glamourised to be the most desirable career for young women			2
pressure : miss @entity0 has revealed she was pressured into wearing revealing outfits by middle aged men ' you look great ' : the men would spin lines such as ' you 've got a great body ' and ' it 'll look classy ' , said the star ‘ they are encouraged to present themselves as hypersexualised , unrealistic , cartoonish , as objects			2
reducing female sexuality to a prize that can be won			0
’ miss @entity0 reserved her most stinging attacks for @entity3 , whose recent @entity68 video pour it up provoked outrage when she was seen writing on a chair in a jewel - encrusted bikini			1
she said : ‘ [ it ] may have over 40 million hits on @entity68 but you only have to look at the online response to see it is only a matter of time before the public turn on an artist for pushing it too far			0
' but the single , like all of @entity3 ’s other provocative hits , will make her male writers and producers and record label guys a ton of money			2
there is no easier way to sell something than to get some chick to get her t * * * out , right ? ’ action : miss @entity0 has called for @entity16 radio chiefs to put a ' decency barrier ' on what they play on their stations and avoid promoting tracks that are accompanied by offensive online pop videos but miss @entity0 admitted her own past was not blemish - free , and said she now regrets appearing in fishnet tights and a corset in the video to her single @entity29 as a 19 - year - old			1
she said : ‘ when i was 19 or 20 i found myself in this position , being pressured into wearing more and more revealing outfits			0
' and the lines i was spun again and again , generally by middle aged men , were " you look great , you ’ve got a great body , why not show it off ? " or " do n’t worry , it ’ll look classy , it ’ll look artistic "			0
' i felt deeply uncomfortable about the whole thing but i was often reminded by record executives just whose money was being spent			0
‘ the consequence of this betrayal of me is that i am being constantly abused on social media , being called slut and a whore and a catalogue of other indignities			0
now i find it difficult to promote my music in the places where it would be best suited , because of my history			0
’ miss @entity0 named a host of other female stars in her lecture , criticising @entity135 raunchy performance on @entity137 ’s @entity136 earlier this year and blaming @entity138 for ‘ putting her sexuality at the heart of her image and her performance			2
’ controversial : miss @entity0 has condemned fellow pop stars @entity4 , left , and @entity3 , right , for acting as ' submissive sex objects ' she called for websites such as @entity68 to exercise greater control over what music videos can be viewed by children , saying : ‘ it is interesting to note that anyone of any age has been able to watch @entity155 ’s simulated masturbation in her “ @entity157 ” video on @entity68 since the website began , and yet you must sign in to the site to prove your age if you wanted to watch @entity163 ’s stunning video for “ @entity164 ”			1
’ the singer also called for radio programmers to take a musician ’s pop videos into account when deciding to give them airtime			1
she said : ‘ @entity171 is notorious for misreading sexual metaphor and innuendo as innocent , most famously with @entity175 ’s @entity174 , but more recently there does n’t seem to be a decency barrier at all			1
‘ if there are no sanctions put on music that is written so zealously about genitalia or uses soft porn in its promotion online what is to stop artists from making their videos and live performances more sexy to drive up online views and subsequently more radio play			1
’ at the height of her fame , miss @entity0 sang for the @entity192 and pope @entity193 and her 2005 pop album spawned four hits			0
however , in recent years she has moved away from the pop world and seen her musical fortunes wane			0
after taking a five - year break from writing , she released back to scratch in 2010			1
the album flop in the charts and sold just 16,000 copies in its first month .			0
