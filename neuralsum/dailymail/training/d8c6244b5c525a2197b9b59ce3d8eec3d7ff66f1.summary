by @entity0 published : 22:04 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 03:39 est , 19 november 2013 it 's a birthday that @entity3 fans are undoubtedly thrilled to celebrate			1
the 50th anniversary episode of the famous sci - fi series will be aired this saturday - and whereas most birthdays are marked with a card , this one has been immortalised by the covers of @entity10			1
the @entity10 introduced the first ever episode on the week of saturday 23 november and the next week it got its first cover on the magazine			1
@entity14 was the first @entity15 , and was followed by @entity16 in the doctor 's footsteps @entity19 was the third doctor in the seventies , while @entity21 took up the reins and made the part his own with his eccentric speech and costumes - and a tendency for long scarfs and jelly babies @entity29 took on the role in the eighties , while @entity32 made the doctor a much more darker and more manipulative character five decades and 50 appearances later they have decided to celebrate @entity3 's 50th anniversary with 12 different covers , featuring 12 incarnations of the @entity15			1
however , whereas viewers across the country will welcome the new episode , some older members of the audience will remember that technically the show is n't 50 , owing to the period when it was dropped from our screens			2
@entity3 boss @entity50 has criticised @entity52 bosses for axing the sci - fi show in the 1980s			1
@entity54 , then @entity55 controller , made the decision to ' rest ' the series because it had become ' ghastly ' and ' pathetic '			2
@entity59 appeared in the sci - fi television film in 1966 , while @entity61 played both the doctor and commander @entity63 @entity65 starred as an unknown incarnation of the doctor , while @entity68 played the doctor in 2005 - and was the first actor to take the role despite being born after the series was created @entity72 fulfilled his childhood dream by playing the @entity15 , while @entity74 is the youngest person to play the doctor executive producer @entity50 told the @entity10 : ' what can one say about 50 years of @entity3 ? well , first of all , one can be pedantic			1
' @entity3 has n't been on for 50 years - owing to the outright stupidity and unforgivable blindness of the @entity52 ( sorry guys , it needs to be said ) , there was a 16 - year gap			1
' he added : ' that gap is important though			0
it confers something very special on this most special of all shows , immortality			0
' @entity3 ... is the show that comes back			1
axe it at your peril			0
someone like me is going to call you a fool			0
' @entity54 previously defended his decision to drop the show			0
the @entity15 ( from left ) @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity29 , @entity61 , @entity32 , @entity59 , @entity68 , @entity72 and @entity74 ' my argument with the producer was that the same audience watching @entity3 was watching @entity102 and @entity103 the show was ghastly			1
' it just got more and more violent ; they resorted to the most horrific hangings			0
it was just horrible to watch			0
it lost its way , ' he said			0
he wrote in @entity114 's book @entity115 : celebrity @entity117 : ' now the production values are high , the scripts are witty , it 's full of invention			2
' and digital effects today enable you to do so much more			0
the only connection it has with its previous life is the title and the premise , but it 's light years ahead			2
' @entity52 director - general @entity130 told the magazine that ' it was the @entity52 who reinvented ' the show ' with some the best acting and writing on television anywhere in the world			2
' @entity137 , @entity137 meets past and present @entity3 actors ( form left to right ) @entity74 , @entity21 , @entity29 and @entity65 during a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the hit tv series at @entity143 meanwhile , former doctor who star @entity72 said that returning to the programme for the one - off appearance in @entity146 felt like waking up out of a dream			1
' the first day i arrived , the costume 's hanging there like it used to every day			2
it feels like ' where have i been ? have i just woken out of a dream ? '' , he said			0
@entity65 , who has a starring role in the 50th anniversary episode , said that he was not a fan of the original series			1
' i do n't think i saw the first episode and i think it escaped me for quite a long time			0
it was a kiddies ' programme , or it was assumed to be			0
it was known basically for the fact that all the scenery used to fall over , ' he said			0
today the @entity168 invaded @entity143 as stars of @entity3 past and present attended a reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the show			1
