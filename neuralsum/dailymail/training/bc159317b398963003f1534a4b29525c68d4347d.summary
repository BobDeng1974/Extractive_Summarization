the method is simple yet brutal - and just one of a variety of ways @entity16 's controversial @entity15 slaughter the animals in the name of fashion			1
others include breaking their necks under a boot or stomping on their heads			0
activists say they are the lucky ones			0
the more docile foxes who do n't struggle are simply strung up and skinned alive to save their slaughterers time and energy			1
those who live nearby say the stench of death hangs in the air while chilling howls of fear and pain can be heard rising from the compound night and day			0
in the name of fashion : puffing casually on a cigarette , a farmhand dangles a white fox by its tail as he clubs it to death with a stick when the fur is finally peeled off over the animals ’ heads , their naked , bloody bodies are thrown onto a pile of those who have gone before them			1
yet even with their pelt removed , some are still alive , gasping for air and blinking slowly for as long as ten minutes as they wait for death , say activists			1
their furs are then shipped off to be worn as hats or coats by fashionistas across the world			0
some of the pictures to have emerged from these farms are too graphic to show on this website			1
animal - rights activists are demanding action to stop this wholesale slaughter of thousands of foxes for the global fashion industry every year			1
waiting to die : the foxes are held in tiny cages awaiting their turn to die as others are slaughtered before their eyes but owners of the controversial @entity15 say that their margins are so slim that they can not afford to give the foxes humane deaths as campaigners demand			1
instead the animals are kept in tiny cages until autumn when they are dragged out through the mud and beaten with clubs or sticks in time for winter fashion collections			1
activists say they even spotted some of the animals being kicked or stamped on to kill them			0
and all of the killings happen before the eyes of animals awaiting their turn , frantically trying to escape			0
hungry market : the pelts are left to dry on planks of wood at the edge of the compound			0
they are then shipped off to be worn as hats or coats by fashionistas across the world only a few are spared to breed next year 's crop			2
@entity107 farm , near @entity109 city , @entity110 , is one of many such slaughterhouses in the rural heartland of northeast @entity16			1
the activists have been backed by locals who do n't work on the farm complaining that the screams and cries as the beasts killed are particularly distressing for children			2
the animals kept on the farm include the blue fox , the common red fox and the raccoon			0
farm manager on @entity125 said that it cost about £ 30 to provide the food to raise one of the animals for nine months until it is fully grown and ready for slaughter			2
and they were only paid around about £ 60 when they sold it to the profit margin was very low			0
he said most farms had between 200 and 300 animals and the money they earned had to keep them running all year hence the need to keep costs low .			2

these *horrific* pictures were taken at @entity143 , in @entity110 , @entity16
it is among many such farms in the region which breed foxes for their fur
@entity151 says his margins are so slim that he ca n't afford humane slaughter
instead some are even skinned alive to save farmhands time and effort
