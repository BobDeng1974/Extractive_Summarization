by @entity0 published : 17:47 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 5 july 2012 @entity1 mp , chairman of the @entity2 , described the figures as ' shocking ' more than 30 hospital trusts have amassed debts totalling £ 300million , it has emerged			1
the amount of taxpayers ’ money being used to bail out stricken hospitals has trebled in the past year			1
only last week it was announced @entity12 was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust			2
today a report by the @entity17 warns it and another 30 trusts are in the red , with total debts of £ 307million			0
the government blames much of the debt on controversial private finance initiative deals , which were expanded under @entity25			1
the @entity17 warned that the government can not afford to carry on bailing out the trusts			2
there are also concerns that the hospitals ’ dire financial situation will lead to worsening patient care			2
last year £ 253million of public money was given to failing hospitals to help them cover everyday running costs – more than treble the £ 76million spent the previous year			1
next year the bailout bill is likely to rise to £ 300million			0
@entity1 mp , chairman of the @entity2 said : ‘ it is shocking that over the past year alone the amount the @entity39 has had to spend on bailing out trusts in financial difficulty rose by 333 per cent			1
‘ trusts in particular received significant support ; @entity44 and @entity45 and @entity46 and @entity47			0
’ the government blames much of the debt on botched @entity51 deals which were encouraged by the @entity25 government			1
these enabled private firms to pay up front for a new cancer ward or maternity department , for example , and the trust would then pay them back in yearly instalments			0
last week it was announced @entity12 - responsible for queen elizabeth ii hospital in @entity63 , pictured - was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust but this amount goes up with interest every year and trusts also have to spend large amounts of money maintaining the buildings so they are ‘ new ’			2

the @entity17 warns that in future , the @entity75 will not be able to afford to continue bailing these trusts out			0
it points out that there is unlikely to be any increase in government spending on the @entity75 - once inflation is taken into account - for at least the next three years			0
the future of @entity12 trust is uncertain but health secretary @entity84 is likely to make a decision later this year			0
it covers three hospitals - @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 in @entity91 and the @entity92 in @entity63 , @entity93 - and any may be closed - down .			1
