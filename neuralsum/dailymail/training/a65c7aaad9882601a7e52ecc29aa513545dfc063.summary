by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 13 may 2013 a row has broken out between academics at two @entity4 colleges after a professor said a planned student accommodation block would spoil the views from his rooms			2
@entity9 , provost of @entity10 and world - renowned @entity12 expert , has complained that @entity15 's building would be ' overbearing , out of scale and out of character ' , and would ' obliterate ' views from his rooms			1
however the @entity19 of @entity15 , @entity20 , has hit back at @entity21 , saying the accommodation is desperately needed for less well - off students and adding : ' we do not feel that colleges should go out of their way to deprive undergraduates of affordable accommodation			2
' the provost of @entity10 , above , has asked his students to object to @entity15 's planned student block @entity33 academics @entity9 , left , and @entity34 , right are at loggerheads over proposed building an architect 's drawing of how the proposed @entity15 accommodation block would look the spat began when prof. @entity9 sent an email to his students suggesting they oppose @entity15 's plans to build a four - storey block on the former @entity45 site that would house 90 students			1
prof. @entity9 , a governor of the @entity47 and board member of @entity49 , says he , as well as students , fellows and staff were ' horrified ' at @entity15 's plans for ' the sensitive western end ' of the proposed building that was far too high			1
he told @entity55 he that his email suggesting students lodge online protests to @entity15 's plans was in response to a query from his college 's @entity62 asking how and on what grounds they might object			1
the professor 's email criticised the ' excessive elevation of the proposed building at the end of the site that overlooks the orchard and our accommodation , and the inappropriately garish and intrusive materials proposed for its roof and upper level ' , according to the @entity78			0
he said if the undergraduates complained , it would ' help us to reduce the level of intrusiveness upon the college - something for which thousands of students in future generations will thank you			0
' representatives from @entity10 took part in talks before the planning process began but no agreement was reached			0
there were two public consultations and a third especially for @entity10 , as well as several meetings with prof. @entity9 which resulted in @entity15 agreeing to lower the roof line and use different cladding materials			1
however the academic is still unhappy with the plans that @entity15 submitted to @entity100 10 days ago			1
@entity10 's orchards are more than 700 years old and professor @entity9 says they will be overshadowed needs more space : @entity103 is short of rooms for undergraduates in the city centre prof @entity9 , 54 , whose grade i - listed lodgings are set in 26 acres of @entity109 - listed grounds with a lake , objected to the fact that the new building would overlook @entity10 's 700 - year - old orchard			1
and he is also concerned that views from his lodgings towards the eighteenth century @entity117 astronomical observatory would be ruined , according to the @entity118			0
he told @entity55 : ' what we want @entity15 to do is step down the end of the building , to bring its height into line with our building next door and to avoid overshadowing the historic orchard so much			0
' this would require them to reposition eight student rooms on the lower level elevation facing the road , so they would n’t actually lose any accommodation			0
' but @entity15 's ms @entity20 said that her historic college had the worst student accommodation in the city and urgently needed more rooms for undergraduates who could not afford to rent privately			1
she told @entity55 : ' we have already reduced the height to meet @entity10 ’s concerns			0
' any further reduction will mean the loss of 14 student rooms – and that means 14 of our students each year will have to rent on the very expensive private market in @entity33 instead of having subsidised @entity15 accommodation			2
' the rooms are “ mini-bursaries ” and we need them to reassure families who are not well off that they can afford to send their children to @entity33			0
that is why they matter so much			0
' she added : ' we have been on our very constrained site since 1315 and are desperately short of student housing , especially for our third years			0
' economist ms @entity20 said @entity15 had 147 student rooms on its city centre site and 320 undergraduates , with further housing on the @entity162 , an arterial road leading out of the city			2
students at @entity15 have come out in support of their rector and her plans			2
@entity169 , president of @entity15 's @entity62 , said : ' never mind a b * * * * * college orchard , 2nd and 3rd year @entity171 do n't even get rooms ! ' @entity10 have ducks and lakes , while at @entity15 we 're bottom in @entity33 for living costs satisfaction			1

he says proposed student block is ' out of scale ' and will ' obliterate ' his view
@entity15 rector @entity20 says historic college needs more space
