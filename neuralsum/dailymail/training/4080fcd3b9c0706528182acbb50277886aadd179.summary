by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 11:23 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 : 12:48 est , 30 december 2013 two young cheetahs at the @entity5 attacked and killed a deer that jumped into their enclosure on friday , and it might not be the last since getting into the zoo is an easy feat for the wild animals that can clear fences more than 12 feet high			1
just a week before the deadly incident , another deer was spotted by park visitor @entity16			1
the 30 - year - old @entity20 , @entity19 resident was looking into the elephant enclosure when she saw an out - of - place deer and snapped its picture			2
too easy : just a week before two cheetahs killed a white - tailed deer that got into their enclosure at the @entity5 , another deer was pictured in the elephant enclosure she says the elephants were n't out at the time , so they went to see the giant beasts in their indoor enclosure			1
soon after , the elephants were released outside and by the time they went back to the place where the deer was spotted , it was gone			0
zoo officials told @entity38 that no witnesses were around when the white - tailed deer got into the cheetah enclosure last friday			1
there is a live stream available of the cheetah enclosure online , but the spokesman said it was n't positioned where the attack took place			0
a zookeeper finally found the deer after hearing noises coming from the cheetah enclosure			2
brother and sister cheetahs @entity56 and @entity57 were found next to the already dead deer 's carcass			1
doctors will examine the deer to make sure it did n't have any diseases			0
zoo officials told the @entity65 that the attack was a ' normal and expected reaction '			2
natural instinct : sibling cheetahs @entity56 and @entity57 ( pictured at three - months - old in 2012 ) have spent all their lives in captivity but still knew what to do when a deer jumped into their enclosure on friday - kill it according to the zoo spokesman , the cheetah enclosure is designed in a bowl - like fashion with a fence on the rim making it impossible for the cheetahs to escape since they 're not good jumpers			1
white - tailed deer however , can clear heights of up to 12 feet high			1
the cheetah enclosure is protected from the top of the bowl by a 12 - foot fence , a moat and live wires , but the deer was still able to make its way over the fence and down into the pen			2
but even for a deer , it would have been nearly impossible to escape since the tall fence was at the top of the enclosure			0
stay away from the zoo : a similar incident happened in november 2009 at an adjacent zoo when a deer got into a lion enclosure			2
above , the entrance to the @entity5 @entity56 and @entity57 have been at the zoo for a little more than a year and a half			1
the two were born through a risky cesarean section in april 2012 that ended up saving both the cubs ' and mother 's lives			0
the cubs were treated for several days in intensive care after their birth			0
three months later , the cheetah cubs made their debut at the zoo but had yet to be named			0
the zoo partnered with @entity120 in the days leading up to the @entity121 and decided to name the brother and sister after the two @entity125 runners who placed highest in the 100 - meter dash			0
@entity127 took home the bronze medal in the the race , and @entity131 won the silver medal .			0
