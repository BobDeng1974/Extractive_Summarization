former @entity16 health secretary @entity15 , chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission , will call for priority to be given to low - income families			1
in the report , mr @entity15 will criticise so - called ' selection by mortgage ' , where families can improve their chance of getting into a popular school by buying a home in the catchment area , saying the best schools should ' not just be for those who can afford to live nearby '			1
and he will urge schools to take advantage of new powers designed to prioritise children eligible for pupil premium funding – those who could have claimed free school meals at any point over the last six years			0
academies and free schools can already use the new powers , and plans are underway to extend the freedom to all other state schools			0
although there is currently no legal requirement for state schools to change their entry criteria , the report urges headteachers to prove that they are ' walking the walk on admissions '			0
the document – called ' cracking the code : how schools can improve social mobility ' – also cautions against putting off disadvantaged families by insisting on expensive uniforms and complicated application forms			1
it calls the extent to which disadvantaged youngsters are failing to get into top schools ' troubling ' , and warns schools that accepted methods of whittling down applicants – such as prioritising children in defined catchment areas or the offspring of staff members – could ' harm social mobility '			1

' there is considerable academic evidence that attending an outstanding school – and avoiding an inadequate school – matters much more for those from disadvantaged backgrounds than for other children			0
' mr @entity15 added : ' some schools have cracked the code on how to improve social mobility by helping disadvantaged children excel in education			2
if some schools can do it , there is no excuse for others not to			0
