by @entity0 an anti-violence activist who stood up to superstar rappers @entity4 and @entity3 has revealed that she was terrified to leave her house and lived in fear of attack after receiving thousands of messages of vile abuse from fans of the rappers			1
@entity12 , 25 , has told @entity13 about the heavy toll her work has taken on her saying she wanted to ' hide away and never do anything like this again ' after her attempts to have the rappers banned from entering @entity19 led to threats of rape and death from rap fans			1
the abuse , which mainly took place on @entity26 , included ' death threats and saying things like they 're going to grab me in the alleyway , that i need a good f * * * , that they 're going to go for my family first			1
one said that they would hire someone to cut my t * * s off , ' she said			2
the address was wrong , but it was only a street away from where @entity12 was sharing a house with another girl			1
' who knows what could have happened			2
it was not a fun time , i did n't sleep much and jumped at noises			2
every time i was alone i was panicked , i was so afraid , but at the same time i was so angry that this was my reality , ' she said			2
the abuse started after @entity12 created a petition to have @entity4 denied a visa to enter @entity19 last year , on the grounds that his lyrics incited violence against women			1
his songs include lines like : ' you call this s * * * rape but i think that rape ’s fun , i just got one request , stop breathing ' and ' i wan na tie her body up and throw her in my basement , keep her there , so nobody can wonder where her face went			2
' @entity12 came to the attention of @entity4 when she tweeted that he would be at a signing event in @entity84 and suggested that the event organisers needed a lesson in what misogyny was			1
@entity4 retweeted her comment to his 1.7 million fans and suddenly her phone went crazy			1
' it was instant , oh my gosh , the barrage of threats , i could n't believe it			2
i was just sitting there looking at my phone , i was like : " holy crap , what is happening ? what have i done ? " ' when @entity12 went to the police about the thousands of messages she had received , she said they laughed at her			1
' they were like : " do you think we 're going to do anything about this ? do you know how often people come in here about threats of abuse and death on @entity26 ? " they just laughed at me like i was so stupid , they gave me a cyber safe brochure and sent me out			1
' the 25 - year - old began working as an anti-violence campaigner in 2012 after she heard about the work of @entity122 , a grassroots organisation run by @entity124 - @entity123 @entity4 singled @entity12 out at his show , not realising that she was in the audience filming his performance the tweet that started it all : @entity4 retweeted this comment from @entity12 , leading to thousands of his followers posting abusive messages to @entity12 @entity12 received thousands of abusive and threatening tweets from fans of @entity4			1
this was one of the least offensive , many of them contained threats of serious violence against the activist @entity12 ended up going to @entity4 's @entity84 show to film evidence of misogyny and she stood in horror as the rapper mentioned her during his set , dedicating his song , @entity149 * * * , to her			1
video of the concert shows @entity4 , who seemed unaware that @entity12 was in the audience , call out to the ' f * * * ing w * * * * ' who tried to get him kicked out of the country			1
' f * * * ing b * * * * , i wish she could hear me call her a b * * * * , too , f * * * ing w * * * *			0
yeah , i got a sold - out show right now b * * * *			2
hey this f * * * ing song is dedicated to you , you f * * * ing c * * *			0
' he also said he hoped @entity12 's children ' get some messed up @entity167 '			1
@entity12 said she was petrified that someone in the crowd would recognise her			1
' i honestly did n't believe what i was hearing when he called me out			0
' she reported him to the police , but they said there was nothing they could do			0
the abuse continued for months after the concert and led to @entity12 meeting with two executives from @entity26 , which led to the introduction of the ' @entity183 ' button on the site			1
' i was like : this is ridiculous , where 's the protection for women ? i got told to delete my account , that was my option			0
they were like , " why are you fuelling this ? " me fuelling this ? are you kidding me ? i 'm speaking out against rape and i 'm getting rape threats in return , yeah that makes sense , ' she said			0
' so much in me wanted to hide away and never do anything like this again , but at the same time it also fuelled me to keep doing this , i was like : there 's no way they 're going to silence me			0
it made me more determined , ' she said			0
in january , @entity12 launched a petition to have @entity3 ( aka @entity3 ) banned from the country and received social media abuse , which lasted for months ready to take on the world : @entity12 has returned to her work as an anti-violence campaigner and in july will start a new role with @entity122 , speaking at schools about sexual violence this determination gave her the energy to try to get @entity3 ( aka @entity3 ) 's visa revoked when he came to @entity19 in january			1
her main objection to @entity3 was that he had admitted to pimping out girls in a @entity225 article in 2013 , saying he had a bus follow him on his 2003 tour with ten women on it			1
' i could fire a b * * * * , f * * * a b * * * * , get a new ho : it was my program			0
city to city , titty to titty , hotel room to hotel room , athlete to athlete , entertainer to entertainer , ' he said			0
@entity245 petitioned ( unsuccessfully ) to have @entity3 denied access to the country , again she was hit with an onslaught of abuse from the rapper 's fans			1
she said that this time she received less abuse and @entity3 did not engage with her directly , but the impact of the abuse was a lot worse			1
' i did n't have anything left in me , i could n't do it			0
it 's just so exhausting and you just feel like , what 's the point sometimes , when is there ever going to be change ? ' the @entity3 campaign was the third campaign the young activist has headed up , the first involved her trying out for the @entity266 in 2012			1
@entity12 said she wanted to see what the experience was like and whether the @entity266 's insistence that the women would be treated as athletes was true			1
she found that it was n't			0
she said that walking into try - outs ' was like walking up to a nightclub			2
we got told we had to have a dress code at the try outs – sports bra and short shorts			0
i had to take my top off so i had my sports bra on			0
' if we lost they would scream at us and call us a pussy and make a ' pussy symbol ' above our heads			0
it was a huge joke			0
' the reaction to @entity12 's exposé was her first experience of serious online abuse , with people taking to @entity26 to threaten and attack her			1
' they were trying to scare me , with rape or death , ' she said			0
the first campaign @entity12 participated in was in protest of the @entity266			2
she tried out for the team and then wrote about the experience @entity12 is speaking out as she is about to return to work with women 's advocacy group @entity122 after a six - month hiatus			1
the @entity84 woman became involved in advocacy work for women and girls after ' frequent unwanted sexual experiences ' as a child and teenager			2
' it 's so sickening , i hate that this is a reality for women and it 's becoming more and more common , ' she said			0
she began researching different organisations and read news articles before she stumbled on @entity122 , a grassroots @entity19 advocacy group headed up by @entity123			2
after the draining experience of her campaigns against the two rappers , @entity12 took some time out – travelling to @entity319 , working a series of odd jobs and spending time with family and friends			1
it is only in the last few weeks , almost six months after @entity3 was in the country , that she has felt able to pick up her advocacy work again			1
' i took a lot of time out			0
i had to put in boundaries			0
i 've only just in the last month slowly , slowly got back into it , ' she said			2
the next step for the young activist is a new role at @entity122 speaking at schools around the country about issues to do with violence , pornography , eating disorders and the sexualisation of children			2
she has been visiting schools for years alongside @entity123 and ca n't get over the fact that many of the students recognise her			0
' the young people at schools i 'm going to , they 've heard of me			0
i have young kids come up to me and say : " it is an honour , can i please shake your hand ? you 're my hero			0
" it makes no sense to me			0
' i 'm doing this because i have to			0
i need to do this for them			0
