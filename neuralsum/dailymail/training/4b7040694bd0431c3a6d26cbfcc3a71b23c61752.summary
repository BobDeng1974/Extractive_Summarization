try putting an ice - cube in your mouth			2
the insides of your mouth and tongue instantly turn numb			0
hold it in still and you will feel pain			0
now try sucking on peppermint			0
the mint itself is at room temperature , but your mouth instantly feels cold and numb			2
how did it do that ? the answer is menthol , the ingredient that instantly tricks your brain into sensing that the food is cold			1
fresh : mint ( pictured ) contains menthol which tricks a receptor protein that senses the change in temperature nerves are the wiring of the brain , carrying information in the form of electric currents			1
our nervous system is built to sense changes in temperatures – a whole set of nerves running from our skin to the brain is dedicated to conveying just that information			1
the receptor protein that senses the change in temperature is called @entity44 and it is found in all cold - sensing nerve cells			1
@entity44 is a voltage gated ion - channel protein – meaning it allows entry of calcium ions on sensing change in temperature			1
we do n’t exactly understand how @entity44 does it			2
whenever there is a drop in temperature , the voltage on @entity44 somehow changes and its shape changes so that it allows calcium ions to flow into the nerve cell			1
this triggers current to flow from the membrane of the nerve cell			2
this current carrying vital information warns the brain of the temperature fall			1
falling temperatures is not the only factor that switches on @entity44 , though			1
a waxy crystalline organic chemical , called menthol , found in peppermint and other mint oils , can somehow bind to @entity44 directly and activate it			1
cool mint : @entity44 protein explains why our mouths feel tingly after brushing our teeth in fact , @entity44 was first discovered as a protein that responds to menthol and later acknowledged for its role in sensing temperature fall			1
we have also found other “ cooling chemicals ” in nature like eucalyptol and icilin , that act similarly			2
peppermint drops fire up @entity44 in cold - sensing nerves and make your mouth instantly feel cool			1
even after you have swallowed , some menthol remains and keeps the nerves activated			2
just a sip of water can get the nerves fired up again			2
in fact , our nerves have similar proteins to sense hot temperatures as well			1
scientists have discovered a protein called @entity104 that acts like @entity44 to sense a rise in temperature			1
@entity107 , the chemical that gives hot peppers their zing , directly activates @entity111 , giving that intense feeling of heat			0
menthol , eucalyptus oil and other cooling agents have long been used to relieve arthritic and other muscle and bone pain			0
we still do n’t understand exactly how it works , but one way it may act is by activating its receptor , @entity44			1
just like your mouth feels numb when you eat peppermint , applying menthol on your skin activates the cold - sensing nerves making the area go numb			1
now you no longer feel the pain			0
menthol can also bind to another receptor called kappa opioid receptor that can also produce a numbing effect			1
chewing gum has been found to remove harmful bacteria from mouths , according to a study			0
researchers found that just a single piece of chewing gum can remove 100 million bacteria - 10 per cent of the microbial load in saliva - in ten minutes			2
and they say that gum can be just as effective as flossing - although they each targets different areas of the mouth			0
the study , which appeared in the journal @entity150 , was led by researchers from the @entity152 in the @entity153			0
they found that the gum was most effective in the first 30 seconds of chewing , and after that it would become less effective in trapping bacteria on a sliding scale			0
also , they note that only gum that did not contain sugar was useful ; if it did contain sugar , it could ‘ feed ’ oral bacteria			0
rubbing menthol on aching muscles also causes the nearby blood vessels to widen , increasing blood flow in the area			0
blood carries in fresh nutrients to repair the area and carries away any toxic waste generated			0
healing happens a lot faster because of this			0
lastly menthol takes away the bad effects of inflammation			0
the word “ inflammation ” comes from the @entity183 word ' inflammare ' which means to ignite or be on fire and came to mean this because of its association with the way an injury causes inflammation and a sensation of heat			0
menthol gives a sensation of cooling by activating @entity44 without any actual fall in temperature in that area			1
this brings down the inflammation in the area			0
of course that is why cooling the injury with ice works as well .			0

nerves are brain *'s* wiring , carrying *messages* in form of electric currents
nervous system built to sense changes in temperatures
the receptor protein that senses the change in temperature is called @entity44 and it is found in all cold - sensing nerve cells
menthol tricks this protein but it is *n't* known why
