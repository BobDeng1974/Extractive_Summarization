by @entity0 sitting before a bank of flickering computer screens and controls , the @entity2 pilot flies a drone in the skies above @entity8			2
but the airman is not operating the £ 10million @entity11 unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity12 ) from the warzone – or even the @entity14			2
instead , he is 8,000 miles away in a hi - tech control hub in a remote part of @entity17 – poised to order the controversial robot to carry out airstrikes using its fearsome array of @entity22 and laser - guided bombs			1
experienced ‘ pilots ’ from @entity28 guide reapers at 50,000ft above @entity29 via satellite from high - security @entity31 , near @entity33			1
seated in two ground control stations the size of shipping containers , the airmen steer the drones remotely as they support @entity41 troops fighting the @entity42			1
the pilotless craft – about the size of a small executive jet – take off from conventional runways in @entity77 , southern @entity8			1
they then fly above the battlefield for up to 14 hours , with cameras beaming live high - definition images and radar data to commanders and crew on the ground			1
keeping a silent eye on a huge area , the devices are able to warn of enemy ambushes or @entity90 , and locate and monitor targets while airstrikes are planned			2
criticised : the @entity2 , which has carried out 459 airstrikes with its five @entity94 during nearly 54,000 hours of operations in @entity8 , accidentally killed four @entity8 civilians in march 2011 lift off : the @entity97 also flies unarmed @entity99 robots , which are 18ft long and used to gather intelligence			2
one is pictured here taking off from @entity77 , southern @entity8 in the air : a reaper from @entity104 on its approach to @entity77 after a mission			2
@entity107 , @entity108 , said the @entity12 were an ' indispensable military capability ' ready for launch : @entity57 @entity111 , from 211 ( @entity113 ) @entity112 , 104 @entity114 ( volunteers ) , operates the @entity45 during an exercise all systems go : a soldier launches a @entity119 during an exercise in @entity121 once authorised , they can launch the weapons to destroy them			0
and it only takes seconds to act against enemies such as terrorist leaders and insurgents planting roadside bombs			0
' it is an essential part of many missions and has saved countless lives			0
if we are unsure about a target , even slightly , we do not fire a weapon ' flight lieutenant @entity136 the @entity14 has flown countless drone missions in @entity8 as well as lawless parts of @entity139 and @entity140 , killing thousands of @entity142 supporters and other extremists			0
but they have been criticised by human rights campaigners who claim hundreds of innocent civilians have also been killed by mistake			0
the @entity2 , which has carried out 459 airstrikes with its five @entity94 during nearly 54,000 hours of operations in @entity8 , accidentally killed four @entity8 civilians in march 2011			0
the @entity2 also operates a sister control centre at @entity152 near @entity153 , where @entity104 flies the 11 - metre drones			1
technology : the pilotless craft fly above the battlefield for up to 14 hours , with cameras beaming live high - definition images and radar data to commanders and crew on the ground seen from above : a clip from a video showing a rocket - propelled grenade being fired from an insurgent compound through a gap in a wall aerial view : a clip from another video showing crop gathering			1
the imagery helps reaper aircrew to discriminate between ' nefarious ' and ' benign ' activity on the ground over the water : a @entity180 unmanned aerial vehicle is photographed last december during trials @entity31 , which has been operating since april , was opened up by the @entity182 to dispel accusations of secrecy			1
parts of the @entity45 3 drone can be guided using a hand - held xbox controller			1
the @entity97 uses the games console device to direct the craft ’s electro - optical and infrared sensors			1
the drone is one of several that can be flown using a laptop in @entity195 , @entity8			0
the @entity196 hovers over @entity90 , while the 16.8cm @entity197 resembles a toy helicopter			0
the @entity97 also flies unarmed @entity99 robots , which are 18ft long and used to gather intelligence			0
defending the use of @entity12 during a visit to the base , defence secretary @entity44 said the ‘ battle - winning technology ’ was ‘ vital ’ in protecting both troops and civilians			1
he added : ‘ much of the criticism of unmanned aerial systems is based on misunderstanding			0
this provides a great opportunity to better inform people about these life - saving assets and their variety of purpose			2
’ flight lieutenant @entity136 , 44 , of @entity28 , said : ‘ it is an essential part of many missions and has saved countless lives			1

the @entity223 yesterday flew its first drone , the £ 15million @entity180 , in an operational theatre from the warship @entity227 to hunt for @entity229 pirates off the coast of @entity231 .			0
