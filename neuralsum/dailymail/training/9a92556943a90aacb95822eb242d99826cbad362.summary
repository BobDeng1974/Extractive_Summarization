by @entity0 last updated at 9:14 am on 14th february 2012 this is the footage that big cat experts claim proves a jet black leopard is stalking the @entity5 countryside			1
the grainy film shows what appears to be a 6ft - long beast slinking menacingly around a field near @entity10 , @entity11			1
it was captured just three miles from @entity13 - where earlier this year the mutilated carcass of a roe deer was found by a dog walker			1
despite the low quality of the never - before - seen footage , enthusiasts insist it is the ' conclusive ' evidence that there are big cats on the prowl in the wild in @entity5			1
big cat expert @entity42 , 65 , from @entity11 , said : ' i think this footage is pretty much conclusive			1
' it is the best footage of a big cat ever filmed in the @entity5 - showing what we believe is a slim , young looking black leopard			1
' you can tell by the size of the animal - it is huge			2
we think it is about 2ft tall up to the shoulder and 6ft long including the tail , which is way bigger than a domestic cat			2
' it also walks just like a big cat and has an extremely long tail			1
there have been literally hundreds of reports of big cat sightings in this area for years			1
this could just be the tip of the iceberg			0
' ms @entity39 says that this footage was not the first time she had seen the cat , and said she had spotted it on five previous occasions			1
she first spotted a large black animal crossing the field near her house in @entity77 , near @entity10 , in july 2009			2
it again appeared again the following evening and she searched online to try and work out what it might be			0
it was then she discovered the stories about a large panther - like animal roaming the @entity85			2
@entity39 , 45 , captured the footage after sighting the big cat near her home on a number of occasions the latest footage shows a similar large black animal to this one spotted in a field in north - west @entity95 later that year she saw it again several times , and took some shaky photographs of the cat in the snow , as well as images of cat footprints			1
the intrigued single mum then got in touch with wildlife explorer mr @entity42 - who loaned her a camcorder to use the next time she spotted the beast			2
in july 2010 she finally caught the animal on film after spotting it skulking in a field 300 yards from her home			1
balancing the handheld camera on a pile of cds , she managed to film if for ten minutes as the beast stalked across the grass			0
it was captured running and walking , before slinking off into the undergrowth near woods , near @entity122			0
mother - of - two ms @entity39 who works as a teaching assistant in a special school , said : ' i was fascinated just watching it walking around the field			1
' i was not frightened at all - just excited to see it and finally get it on camera			2
it was only about 300 yards away			0
' i believe he was looking for voles and mice in the short grass after it had been cut			0
at one stage a fox was in the same shot so you could compare the difference in size			0
' the " @entity26 " was spotted only just a few miles away from here so i do believe it could be the same animal			0
ms @entity39 's footage was taken not far from where a number of animals were slaughtered , apparently by a wild big cat ' it looked quite calm and not the snarling big cats you usually see in pictures			1
i have n't seen it since but i now really believe that these creatures are out there			0
' i had never really heard of any big cats in @entity5 before i started spotting this one - now i know of loads of people that have seen it around here			1
' ms @entity39 , who lives with son @entity162 , 20 , and daughter @entity163 , ten , handed the footage to mr @entity42 , who approached wildlife filmmaker @entity165 and the pair began work on a documentary about the elusive creatures			2
the team used imaging techniques to estimate the size of the black cat as 2ft high to the shoulder and 6ft long , including a 2ft tail			2
they finally decided to release the pictures yesterday - after the devastated carcasses of three roe deer and three wallabies were found nearby last month			2
@entity181 was taken from the first deer , which was found by a dog walker on january 4 this year.the body had all of its vital organs missing and had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther - like kill			0
one of three wallabies found devoured on farmland in the @entity85 last month			0
dna tests suggested it had been devoured by a fox the carcass of one of the deer killed last month is examined to allow experts to carry out the dna test another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between @entity201 and @entity202 , near @entity203 - ten miles away - on january 10			1
a third roe deer body was found at a development in @entity207 's edge , near @entity208 , days later			0
three wallabies , part of a private collection , were also found dead by their devastated owner on january 6 , two days after his first kill at @entity214			0
but a team of scientists , lead by dr @entity217 of @entity218 , failed to find any big cat dna on the carcass dr @entity217 , associate professor at the university 's @entity222 , said : ' we did not detect cat dna on either deer carcass			1
' other than deer , by far the strongest genetic signal we found on the @entity214 carcass was from a fox			0
' that fox dna was found on the ribs , legs and plucking sites from the @entity40 deer carcass			0
' on the second deer carcass we found canid dna			0
a more detailed analysis is underway to pin down the canid species but our expectation is that that will also be fox dna			0
