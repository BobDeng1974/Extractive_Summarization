since 2010 the pay gap has closed at a rate of only 0.3 per cent per year on average , according to the @entity31			1
at this rate @entity0 claims it could take more than 60 years to deliver equal pay for women			1

miss @entity10 said : ' women should not have to wait more than 100 years for equal pay			2
@entity0 's shadow women 's minister @entity10 accused the @entity11 of the ' turning the clock back ' for female workers by failing to do more to reduce unfairness in the workplace ' the @entity11 are turning the clock back for women			1
more women are struggling to make work pay , earning less than the living wage and facing sky - high childcare costs			2
this is n't the progress our mothers , aunties and sisters fought for			0
' when @entity56 claims that working women have never had it so good , women know this is n't a government that speaks for them			0
' according to the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) 2013 , women still earn just 80p for every pound men take home			1

miss @entity10 added : ' only @entity0 will deliver on the promise of equal pay with pay transparency , tackle the scandal of low pay and expand access to free childcare to make work pay for families across @entity80			2
' next may there is a big choice for women across this country			0
a @entity85 @entity80 with progress on equality stalled , more women on low wages , on zero - hours contracts and earning less than their male colleagues			2

however , i am clear that it remains too high and i 'm committed to reducing it more			0
' that 's why the steps we 've taken have gone far further than the last @entity99 - by giving employees the right to request flexible working as well as introducing tax - free childcare and shared parental leave from 2015 so that women can make the right choice for them about how to balance work and families			0

she went on : ' in a fair society men and women should be equally rewarded for their work			0
' it 's time to make large companies publish the difference between what they pay men and women - and it 's a shame that the @entity11 have blocked this in @entity99			2

' @entity127 are modernising the workplace and encouraging employers to become more family friendly - through measures like shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working			0
