a car fanatic was reduced to tears when his beloved @entity3 supercar was ' totally wrecked ' after technicians fixing a minor fault crashed during a test drive			1
@entity8 left his unique @entity10 @entity9 - which costs £ 170,000 to buy new - with technicians at a @entity3 dealer near his home in @entity14 , @entity15 , to fix problems with its onboard computer			1
just hours after he had dropped his pride and joy off at @entity3 he received a call to say the flash motor had crashed on a nearby dual carriageway			1
@entity8 was shocked to recieve a call from the garage hours later to say his @entity26 had been involved in a smash on a nearby dual carriageway the dealership claims the car , which boasts a six - litre engine and a top speed of 180mph , was being driven ' legally and sensibly ' when it spun off the road in bad weather			1
mr @entity8 , 56 , bought the car in 2010 and has since spent £ 30,000 on maintaining it			1
he said he is now considering legal action against the dealership			0
the semi-retired it consultant , said : ' when i took the car in i told them there was also a problem with the traction control system but i was assured nothing was wrong			0

' my first concern was for the safety of the driver who thankfully was n't hurt			0
the @entity3 crashed on a dual carriageway just six miles from the @entity3 dealership mr @entity8 , 56 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , bought the car for £ 40,000 in 2010 and has since spent £ 30,000 on maintaining it ' the dealership tried to take it directly to a bodyshop but i demanded to see it			1
' i thought the car might have been involved in a minor crash but i could n't believe it when i saw it - it was totally written off and will have to be scrapped			2
' there was a tear in my eye because i have so many fond memories of the car			2
it was a car for life and it 's irreplaceable			0
' the thing that angers me most is the suggestion the car was being sensibly driven			2
' thousands of cars drove down that road that day , only three crashed and mine was the only one to be totally wrecked			2
mr @entity8 's @entity3 was the sought after @entity9			1

my only mistake was leaving my car with the dealership in the first place			0
' the flash motor was one of only 90 in the country and is the only one with a £ 25,000 pearlescent paint job			2

my car was unique and i do n't think i am being unreasonable to ask for a replacement			0
' @entity120 , managing director of the @entity121 of @entity3 dealerships , said : ' i was distressed to learn of the incident with mr @entity8 's car , and i 'm relieved that no one else was involved in this unfortunate accident			1
' as soon as it happened , we co-operated fully with the authorities , and the police have confirmed that the car was being driven legally and sensibly in the road conditions			1
' this is cold comfort for mr guest of course , who is a loyal and valued customer , and i along with everyone in my team at @entity138 are committed to doing the right thing by him			0
' we 're working closely with the insurance team and are keeping mr @entity8 fully informed throughout			1
