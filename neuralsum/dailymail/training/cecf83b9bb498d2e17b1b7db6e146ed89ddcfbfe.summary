it is named after the @entity2 god of thunder , can fly faster than the speed of sound and evades enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
this is @entity8 , @entity10 ’s latest pilotless combat aircraft , which is even capable of selecting its own targets			2
the revolutionary superdrone is due to make its maiden flight in the next few weeks and could spearhead the fight against terrorism in @entity17			1
@entity8 ( graphic pictured ) is named after the @entity2 god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
during tests , @entity8 also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position military chiefs believe @entity8 ’s ground - breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from @entity10 bases to attack targets worldwide			1
but the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control			1
experts even warned last night that the new technology raised the nightmare spectre of out - of - control robots waging war on humans – and called for a global ban on autonomous technology			1
@entity10 ’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground			2
but @entity8 will follow a set flightpath using on - board computers to perform manoeuvres , avoid threats and identify targets			1
only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller			2
professor @entity61 , a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at @entity63 , said last night : ‘ this is a very dangerous move			2
once it has been developed , who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it			2
’ last week , prime minister @entity72 warned that the fight against terrorism in @entity17 could last decades , meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region			1
military technology : a @entity81 @entity80 mq - 9 reaper drone takes off from @entity82 , @entity83			1
a proliferation in mainly @entity81 military technology has sparked a drone arms race the controversy surrounding their use was highlighted last week when the @entity90 launched an investigation into the deaths caused by conventional drone attacks			2
@entity94 currently operate armed drones only in @entity83 , where they target @entity98 insurgents			0
however , a proliferation in mainly @entity81 military technology has sparked a drone arms race			0
to compete , the @entity101 has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles			0
a defence source said that @entity8 ’s long - anticipated maiden test flight has been delayed by technological setbacks as well as @entity10 aviation safety laws which restrict the flight of drones in this country			1
but the source added that the aircraft , which weighs eight tons and is about the size of an @entity116 jet , will make its first flight in @entity118 in the next few weeks , where its progress will be closely monitored by @entity122 chiefs			0
prof @entity61 said : ‘ @entity8 is a concept prototype – so it is really the beta version of an intercontinental attack plane			0
with the proliferation of pilotless combat aircraft that is certainly going to happen , it was n’t going to be long before the person was taken out of the loop			0
competition : a @entity81 k - max pilotless freight helicopter in @entity133 in @entity83			1
to compete , the @entity101 has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft ‘ it would be very difficult for a human to keep control of teams of these moving at such speed			1
it could put ours at a disadvantage to others that did not have a human supervisor			0
this is why we need a global ban on autonomous drones before proliferation begins in earnest			0
’ but the @entity122 says the programme is designed so that a human will make the final decision on the firing of weapons and that as a ‘ demonstrator ’ it was far too early to say what role @entity8 would have in future combat missions			0
the superdrone , manufactured by @entity162 , is the product of a 2006 @entity122 decision to develop and fly an uncrewed aircraft that goes one better than current @entity81 systems by using a customised @entity168 jet engine rather than a propeller			1
when its sleek design was first unveiled in 2010 at an airfield in @entity173 , @entity174 , it was accompanied by boasts from its designers that @entity8 could strike at the heart of @entity10 ’s enemies without risking @entity10 lives			0
@entity162 chiefs said @entity8 would be an ‘ autonomous stealthy @entity181 [ @entity181 ] ultimately capable of precisely striking targets at long range , even in another continent ’			0
an @entity122 spokesman said : ‘ @entity8 is a trailblazing project that reflects the very best of our nation ’s advanced design and technology skills and is a leading programme on the global stage			0
‘ @entity194 play an important role in operations , helping reduce the risks faced by military personnel on the front line			0
‘ forthcoming @entity8 trials will provide further information about the potential capabilities of @entity203			0
’ a spokesman for @entity162 said : ‘ @entity8 is a joint @entity162 - @entity122 programme and we are not at liberty to confirm any details of the forthcoming flight , including the location , timing or who may be present			2
