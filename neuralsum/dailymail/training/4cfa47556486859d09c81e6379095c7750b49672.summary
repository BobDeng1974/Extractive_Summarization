by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 5 december 2013 tens of thousands of @entity4 nationals are having their @entity6 visas rubber - stamped in just ten minutes , an official report reveals today			1
despite the country being rated as ‘ high - risk ’ from fraudulent applications , visitor visas were being waved through without proper checks , inspectors found			2
@entity13 , the chief inspector of @entity14 and @entity15 , found refusal rates had plummeted to just 4 per cent			1
the findings emerged in a highly critical report into the visa processing centre in @entity20 , @entity21			1
it handles about 56,000 applications a year , of which more than 36,000 are visitor visa applications from the @entity4			1
thousands of @entity4 , who have recently been protesting against their government 's decision to suspend @entity4 's @entity29 integration ( pictured ) , are having their visas rubber - stamped in just 10 minutes anyone given a visitor visa can enter @entity6 for a set period of time , but there are scant checks on whether they leave the country at the end			1
@entity4 is not part of the @entity40 so its nationals have no rights to come to @entity6 and can not work unless given specific permission			1
the report will raise concerns that thousands are getting in , staying and working in the black economy			1
the report found inexperienced and temporary staff were under pressure to clear 45 applications a day – the equivalent of one every ten minutes			1
as a result , document checks designed to prove if migrants were genuine visitors – or trying to enter the country permanently – were not carried out			0
managers were breaking rules suggesting they should review one in five cases , and in a three - month period , only 3 per cent were given additional scrutiny			2
@entity4 is not part of the @entity40 so its nationals have no rights to come to @entity6 and can not work unless given specific permission			1
the report will raise concerns that thousands are getting in , staying and working in the black economy mr @entity13 criticised the ‘ poor quality ’ of decision making in the @entity66			1
he said it was of ‘ serious concern ’ that so little attention was paid to quality assurance of decisions made by entry clearance officers who process visa applications			1
and he cited the ‘ real risk that visa decisions were being taken without the necessary checks being conducted ’			0
security assessments suggested @entity4 applications were ‘ high risk ’ because they were often backed by forged or counterfeit documents			1
but applications from @entity4 were much less likely to be refused than those from low - risk countries			1
the report said : ‘ we were surprised to find that the refusal rate for @entity89 was significantly lower than for other posts in the region			2
‘ we would have expected a post which the risk profile indicated was a high risk and which reportedly received a high number of applications that were not genuine , to have a refusal rate exceeding that of spoke locations deemed to present a lower risk			2
’ inspectors found the refusal rate fell from 14 per cent in october 2012 to just 4 per cent in june this year			2
it cited as reasons the hiring of temporary and inexperienced staff and the increase in processing targets ‘ meaning that officers may not have had enough time to conduct further research on applications or conduct verification checks in all required cases ’			0
the centre also processes visa requests from @entity116 nationals living in other parts of @entity118 and @entity119 , such as @entity120 and @entity121			0
mr @entity13 added : ‘ it is vitally important , if the visa application process is to be fair and transparent , that the @entity124 corrects these serious failings in its decision making			0
’ a @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ protecting the border is our top priority			0
the @entity6 is not a member of the @entity29 free movement zone and so visa holders have their visas and documentation checked again at the border			1
‘ we have reviewed the cases highlighted by the chief inspector , and we are satisfied that no individual was issued with a visa when they should not have been			0
’ * at least 385,000 @entity120 and @entity144 migrants will arrive in @entity6 over the next five years , a report claimed last night			1
the @entity146 think - tank said the real total would ‘ significantly surpass ’ current estimates of how many will come when working restrictions end on january 1			0
its report suggests an average of 77,000 @entity120 and @entity144 will come to the @entity6 annually , made up of 44,000 @entity144 and 33,000 @entity120			1
the report ’s author @entity153 wrote : ‘ this paper ’s unexpected finding is that the most alarming of the forecasts is actually insufficiently alarmist			0
’ the report says @entity6 is attractive to educated and skilled migrants who want to earn more , but also to a ‘ not insignificant ’ group of unskilled and uneducated migrants who ‘ avail themselves of the smorgasbord of government - provided benefits ’			1
it criticises the @entity6 for creating a ‘ self - inflicted economic migrant own goal ’ as a result of its over- generous welfare spending			1
hitting back : @entity171 says @entity6 workers would rather live off benefits than take low - paid jobs @entity6 should be grateful to @entity120 and @entity144 for taking jobs shunned by local workers , according to a @entity120 government minister			2
@entity171 , the country ’s labour minister , said many @entity6 workers would rather live off benefits than take jobs picking fruit or working in hotels			2
her comments came as @entity186 mayor @entity185 became the most senior politician to back the call for restrictions on workers from both countries to be extended beyond january 1			0
@entity192 has announced restrictions on new arrivals from the @entity40 claiming benefits			0
but in an interview with the @entity196 , mrs @entity171 said it was generous welfare payments to @entity6 which left open thousands of low - paid jobs for migrants			2
she said : ‘ @entity6 people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which @entity120 citizens , for example , are going to apply			0
‘ if there are any vacancies , somebody will fill them , whether they are from @entity120 , @entity211 , @entity212 or wherever			0
’ ‘ taking into account the fact that @entity120 citizens in the @entity6 contribute greatly to the gdp and also that many of these people are young and well qualified , the @entity6 should be grateful that these people have come to live there			0
’ about 22,000 @entity120 and @entity144 work in the @entity6 in the summer picking fruit and vegetables – and tens of thousands more are self - employed or have visas to take jobs in health and social care			2
last night home secretary @entity225 made clear her determination to change @entity40 free movement rules – and suggested ministers could put a ‘ cap ’ on overall migrant numbers			0
ahead of a meeting of @entity40 ministers , mrs may said : ‘ i will make clear that i believe we need to change the way free movement rules work			0
looking ahead , we must seize the opportunity presented by the prime minister ’s plan to reform the @entity40 and address the problems caused by free movement			0
’ mr @entity185 , speaking on @entity241 , said he would like the extension of the block on benefit claims to ‘ go for six or 12 months ’ because of competition for jobs that left ‘ many young @entity247 who feel they are not getting a fair suck of the sauce bottle ’			0
he urged mr @entity192 to push for such changes in the @entity40 .			0

refusal rates are just four per cent , according to a report into visa centre
there are fears @entity4 are coming to @entity6 and working in black economy
staff are forced to process 45 applications a day - one every 10 minutes
