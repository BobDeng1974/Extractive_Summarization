by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 05:40 est , 10 february 2013 victim : @entity2 was found dead at home a week after giving evidence against the teacher who abused her as a teenager the historic failure of our criminal justice system to properly try sexual abuse cases has claimed its first victim through the shocking death of @entity13			1
a solitary tragedy ? it ’s the worst i know of but i ’m sure that a lot of victims suffer deep distress when giving evidence			1
her death throws into sharp relief the way the courts deal with vulnerable victims of sexual abuse			2
the criminal justice system has to understand not only that sexual abuse can leave a deep wound , but that it will reopen when probed , and to probe is the job the courts embark upon in every such trial			2
so victims need expert support			2
i find it extraordinary that support for @entity13 seems to have been profoundly lacking			1
the police advised her for two years not to have counselling for the trauma until after the trial			0
why ? their theory may be that , unless the pain of having being abused comes out , the jury will be unimpressed by her evidence			2
so she must be kept in pain			0
@entity13 appears not even to have been kept informed of when the trial was taking place until shortly before it opened and must have felt unsupported by the system she was putting herself at stake to assist			1
that can not have been easy			0
we thought we had left behind those dark days when rape victims would be routinely humiliated in court , but maybe we have n’t left them far enough behind			0
routine : @entity73 represented @entity56 and cross-examined @entity13 during the trial at @entity75 defence barristers routinely ask for counselling notes to be disclosed to them so that they can go through them to find any vulnerabilities – the @entity80 can ask the judge ahead of the trial to refuse but they rarely apply to do so and judges on the whole do n’t stop them being handed over			1
this is the other reason why police might try to deter counselling			0
i was not in court when @entity13 was cross-examined but her plea ‘ this feels like rape all over again ’ shows how agonising she found it			1
clearly @entity56 and his ex-wife were basing the case on the fact that she was a fantasist and @entity57 ’s barrister had to ask the questions , but it is self - evident how offensive this must have been to @entity13 and her family			1
i do think that we have improved the legal system since @entity104 ’s landmark review of rape cases			0
but we have a long way to go			0
we need to treat all victims as gently as we treat patients and be truthful to them ahead of a trial about what it will entail			0
otherwise we risk deterring them from coming forward			0
we need to discover who gave @entity13 the shameful advice not to have counselling , and why the police and @entity80 did not ensure she understood what was going to happen when she was cross-examined			1
we must urgently look at how we try rape cases			0
it is the least that we can do for @entity13 now .			1
