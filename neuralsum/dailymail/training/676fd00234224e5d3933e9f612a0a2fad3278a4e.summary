by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor @entity2 has been challenged to get off the beach and campaign to keep @entity4 in the @entity5 - by @entity6			1
mr @entity6 laid down the challenge after it emerged the prime minister did not interrupt his summer holiday in @entity10 to watch last night ’s live tv debate on @entity4 independence			1
the prime minister also failed to tune in to the first clash between mr @entity6 and @entity15 – despite claiming it would ‘ break my heart ’ to see the @entity5 broken up			1
today , mr @entity6 said the pm was the real leader of the ' no ' to independence campaign , adding : ' let ’s have him in @entity4 now , let ’s see if he can do any better that @entity15 did			1
mr @entity2 returns to @entity47 tomorrow – from his third holiday this year – with less than three weeks to go before next month ’s historic referendum on september 18			1
he will arrive back in @entity50 amid growing confidence within the ‘ yes ’ to independence campaign , following last night ’s crushing victory for mr @entity6 in the second and final debate on independence			1
mr @entity6 easily won the contest according to a snap poll for @entity58			1
some 71 per cent of voters said the @entity61 leader was the victor			2
just 29 per cent thought mr @entity15 had won the contest			2
today , a confident mr @entity6 challenged mr @entity2 to campaign against independence in @entity4			1
it comes after mr @entity6 accused his debate rival mr @entity15 of being the ‘ front man for the @entity67 ’ in last night 's debate			1
he said : ‘ @entity15 is in alliance with the @entity67 in this campaign			0
that is what the no campaign is			0
‘ let ’s have the real leader of the no campaign , @entity2			2
let ’s have him in @entity4 now			2
‘ let ’s see if mr @entity2 is prepared to come to @entity4 and have the debate			1
’ last night 's victory is a dramatic turnaround for mr @entity6 who was left flailing earlier this month after mr @entity15 successfully challenged him over the economy and the future of the pound			1
mr @entity6 's challenge came after he clashed with @entity15 ( left ) in last night 's live television debate on the @entity88 first minister @entity6 gets his make - make up during an interval in the second television debate last night former chancellor @entity15 was left reeling after mr @entity6 went all out attack but last night mr @entity6 came armed with a number of currency options for an independent @entity4 , but insisted keeping the pound was the best			1
mr @entity15 meanwhile was left repeating his criticism that mr @entity6 had not offered a plan b if @entity97 stopped @entity4 using sterling			1
a ' yes ' vote in @entity4 on september 18 would trigger a political earthquake at @entity97 – and could even force mr @entity2 to resign			1
the prime minister has insisted he would not resign if @entity4 voted for independence			1
but if mr @entity6 triumphs next month , there will immediately be pressure for him to go from within his own party			1
former conservative leadership rival @entity106 said a ‘ yes ’ vote would be ‘ particularly humiliating ’ for mr @entity2			1
@entity109 , professor of politics at @entity111 , added : " a yes vote would destroy @entity2 's place in the history books			2
he would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping @entity4 in the union and lost his gamble			1
’ despite the threat to his premiership , mr @entity2 ’s spokeswoman indicated that the prime minister did not watched last night ’s independence debate			1
‘ the prime minister watched news reports of the debate , ’ said the spokeswoman			1
asked why mr @entity2 had missed a key moment in the independence battle , she said : ‘ the key moment is when people go to vote on september 18			1
’ the @entity124 only watched highlights of the first debate earlier this month , which was won by mr @entity15 , and perhaps he was confident of another victory by the pro-union camp			1
following last night ’s debate , mr @entity15 admitted the battle to keep @entity4 in the union would be fought ‘ right down to the wire ’			1
but the former chancellor insisted he was ‘ increasingly confident ’ that @entity4 would vote against leaving the @entity5 when they go to the polls in just over three weeks ’ time			0
today , as he visited a factory in @entity143 , @entity144 , mr @entity15 said the no campaign had been ‘ right to focus on currency ’ , adding : ‘ one of the things that is striking in the last three weeks is the amount of people who have come up to me and said “ what about this plan b ? ” is quite remarkable			2
’ when asked if changes would be made to the @entity156 campaign following last night ’s debate , he insisted : ‘ absolutely not			0
’ postal votes for the september 18 ballot are being sent out from today , and mr @entity15 added that as the ‘ finishing post ’ comes into sight , @entity4 are increasingly focused on the decision to be made			1
he said : ‘ there ’s a very clear choice here and i think people can see that , people are very focused now , especially as they can see the finishing post			0
‘ i ’m increasingly confident we will win , but it is our job to win well and to win well we ’ve got to carry on campaigning up untill 10pm on september 18			1
' mr @entity6 meanwhile told @entity171 he had ‘ argued persuasively ’ on currency , setting out his position that it was ‘ common sense for a common currency ’			2
he argued that the @entity176 campaign was winning ‘ decisively ’ on the key issues of protecting public services and creating jobs in @entity4			1
the first minister said : ‘ he ( @entity15 ) had his chance and he muffed it last night			0
the currency bluff has been called			0
the @entity4 people are calling that bluff			0
‘ the no campaign had their chance , their bluff has been called			0
people have , i think , overwhelmingly in @entity4 now in poll after poll shown that we want to keep the pound			2
that is the decision that the @entity4 people are being asked to make			0
' the @entity4 first minister went on the attack immediately in last night 's debate - questioning what would happen to the @entity198 , welfare and oil under @entity202 rule from @entity50 after 2015			1
mr @entity6 also claimed the former @entity204 chancellor had made the ‘ biggest revelation ’ in the independence debate so far after he admitted @entity4 could use the pound without the rest of the @entity5 ’s permission after independence			1
but mr @entity15 said this would leave @entity4 at the mercy of a ‘ foreign country ’ telling it how much it could spend like @entity214 countries which have to get their budgets signed off in @entity217			2
mr @entity6 also admitted for the first time that there were other options for @entity4 than keeping the pound			1
he said : ‘ i 'm looking for a mandate to share sterling in a currency union			0
’ but he added : ‘ there are other options for @entity4			0
’ however mr @entity15 said : ‘ the thing about a currency union is both sides have to agree to it			0
we are talking about a huge risk if we assume it ’s going to fall into line			0
‘ it ’s not a matter for @entity6 what the alternative is			0
if it ’s the @entity239 model i want to know			0
if it ’s the @entity241 i do n’t want that either			0
i want to know what plan b is			0
’ but after being pressed by mr @entity6 he admitted : ‘ we could us the pound			2
’ mr @entity6 said : ‘ @entity15 admitted we could use the pound anyway			2
they can not stop us using the pound – the most important revelation in this debate			0
’ the pair also clashed over @entity251 oil and the @entity198			0
the @entity61 leader said every other country in @entity254 would give their ‘ eye teeth ’ for @entity251 oil			0
but mr @entity15 said : ‘ once it ’s gone it ’s gone			0
what i do n’t want to see is my country so dependent on something that is so volatile			0
’ he added : ‘ he is asking us to take his word on everything			0
‘ we need answers to tonight , right here right now			0
are we going to place all our bets on @entity6 alone being right ? ’ mr @entity15 said : ‘ this is a decision for which there is no turning back			2
’ but mr @entity6 said : ‘ this is an extraordinary time for us all			2
the eyes of the world and , indeed , focus is on @entity4			0
’ he added : there is much far too much , far too much , that is still controlled in @entity97			0
we could n't stop the bedroom tax , we could n't stop illegal wars			0
’ he added : ‘ three weeks on thursday we can take things back to @entity4 hands			0
absolutely no - one , non-one , can run the affairs of @entity4 better than the people of @entity4			0
’ mr @entity6 added : ‘ this is our time , it ’s our moment , let us do it now			2
