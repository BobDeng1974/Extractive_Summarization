by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 6 april 2013 a designer has invented self - assembly furniture which moulds itself into whatever shape you want - potentially spelling the end for the @entity7 flatpack			2
the plastic material expands into its final shape ' like popcorn ' once it is plugged into a socket and heats up to temperature			1
and if you do n't like the final design of the chair or table you can simply get the software to reshape it whatever way you want			1
@entity27 hopes it will one day spell the end for the @entity7 flatpack ' grows like popcorn ' : the furniture , which is at the prototype stage , moulds itself into shape in just ten minutes the technology has been produced by @entity35 designer @entity27 and could be ready for mass production within a decade			1
the furniture is made from shape memory polyurethane which expands from five per cent of its final size when heated to @entity26			1
if the final product gets chipped it can be melted down and reformed in the space of a few minutes and the damage will have gone			2
mr @entity27 said his revolutionary product could one day spell the end for the @entity7 flatpack			0
he told the @entity47 : ' if everybody goes to @entity7 and buys a flatpack then you have a typical key it together			0
here the material is the mechanism , so finally the material is doing the work for you			2
' you buy it in a rolled up set			0
when you bring it home you plug it into electricity and it becomes a chair			0
@entity35 designer @entity63 tests out one of the plastic chairs			1
they could go on sale within a few years prototype : the furniture is made from shape memory polyurethane which expands from five per cent of its final size when heated to @entity26 ' if you are not liking the design you can reshape it in your own creation			1
' when moving house the furniture can simply be melted back down to its original size before being ' reassembled '			2
the product will be unveiled at the @entity80 festival next week			0
the idea came from another project to design an antenna for a spaceship which would grow to its full size when exposed to the sun. it is unclear what price the product will retail at			0
mr @entity27 has been working on it since 2002 .			0

plastic material expands into shape when plugged in and heated to @entity26
if you do n't like the final design , the plastic can be reshaped in any way
unique furniture uses shape memory polyurethane
@entity35 designer @entity63 has been working on *scaled* down *versions* and hopes to have it on sale within years
