a @entity2 pastor who converted from @entity3 is to be put to death for leaving @entity3 following the ruling of an @entity7 court , it was reported today			1
@entity8 , 34 , was arrested more than two years ago on charges of apostasy , and has now been sentenced to death by an @entity7 court for refusing to renounce his @entity13 , according to the pastor 's legal team			1
the father - of - two had defied a request by the @entity19 provincial court , in @entity20 , @entity7 , to repent , and now faces death by hanging			1
facing execution @entity8 with his wife and two children in an undated photograph circulated by religious rights organisations mr @entity8 may be executed at any time without warning , as death sentences in @entity7 can be carried out immediately or dragged out for years			1
if the execution goes ahead he would be the first @entity2 to be officially executed in @entity7 for religious reasons in 20 years			0
the married father - of - two was detained in his home city of @entity20 in october 2009 , while attempting to register his church			0
supporters of the pastor say he was arrested after questioning the @entity37 monopoly on the religious instruction of children in @entity7			0
critics have said the execution could be seen as a form of defiance at @entity45 sanctions against @entity7 in the row over its nuclear agenda			1
@entity48 , executive director of @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , told @entity50 : ' this is defiance			2
they want to say they will carry out what they say they will do			0
' the world needs to stand up and say that a man can not be put to death because of his faith			2
' this one case is not just about one execution			0
we have been able to expose the system instead of just letting one man disappear , like so many other @entity2 have in the past			0
' church officials say there may be as many as 100,000 devoted @entity2 in the country and that @entity7 's leadership is concerned about the spread of @entity13			0
@entity8 was initially charged with protesting , but charges against him were later changed to ' apostasy ' - or abandoning @entity3 - and ' evangelising @entity37 ' , which both carry the death sentence			1
he was later tried and found guilty of apostasy in september 2010 , and sentenced to death			0
in june this year the @entity77 of @entity7 upheld the death sentence but asked the lower court in @entity20 , which issued the initial sentence , to re-examine whether or not he had been a practising @entity37 adult prior to converting to @entity13			0
@entity8 told the court during his first hearing on sunday that he had no intention of returning to @entity3			1
he said : ' repent means to return			0
what should i return to ? to the blasphemy that i had before my faith in @entity90 ? ' however , the court said that because @entity8 has @entity3 ancestry , he therefore must ' recant his faith in @entity90 '			1
when the court ordered him to ' return to the religion of your ancestors - @entity3 ' , @entity8 replied : ' i can not			1
' @entity105 secretary of state @entity104 , along with the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , has condemned @entity7 for arresting mr @entity8 @entity107 , of advocacy group @entity106 , said : ' this law dictates what should be done with apostates , depending on what type of apostasy has been committed			1
' mr @entity113 added that section 6.225 of @entity7 's controversial legislation says that if a person 's parents were @entity37 at the time they were trying to conceive a child , and that converts to another religion and renounces @entity3 , he or she would be a national apostate			2
he said : ' the death sentence is the penalty for national apostate , but after the verdict is pronounced , he or she will be commanded to repent of what he or she has done ' if he refuses to repent , he will be killed			0
' the written verdict of the @entity77 's decision also included a provision for annulment of the death sentence if mr @entity8 recanted his faith			1
although the court found that mr @entity8 was not a practising @entity37 adult , the court said he remained guilty of apostasy because he had @entity37 ancestry			2
mr @entity8 's lawyer , @entity141 , told the court that the repeated demand for his client to recant his @entity2 faith violated @entity7 law and its constitution			2
the last @entity7 @entity2 convert from @entity3 executed by the @entity7 government was @entity149 pastor @entity148 in 1990			2
however , several other @entity2 , including at least six @entity151 pastors , are reported to have been assassinated in @entity7 by unknown killers in recent years .			0

@entity8 , who converted from @entity3 , faces death by hanging
critics say move is show of defiance over @entity45 sanctions
