cars could be driving themselves down @entity2 streets far sooner than expected , thanks to a change in a global treaty backed by @entity2 countries			1
a little - noticed amendment to the @entity9 @entity8 agreed last month would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self - driving cars			1
it was pushed by @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , whose high - end carmakers believe they are ready to zoom past @entity21 tech pioneers and bring the first ' autonomous vehicles ' to market			1
a @entity32 self - driving car , a white @entity31 , is pictured the amendment agreed last month by the @entity34 on @entity35 would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			1
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			1
provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles , all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws			1
the convention covers @entity2 countries , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , although not the @entity21 , @entity54 or @entity55			1
' today i am only allowed to take my hands off the wheel to a limited extent , ' said @entity60 , head of @entity61 at @entity62 and head of development at @entity65			1
' thankfully the @entity8 has been changed			1
' for years , so - called ' autonomous vehicles ' have been a futuristic dream pioneered by silicon valley companies like @entity32			1
but as the technology becomes more affordable , @entity2 's luxury automakers say they are well placed to take advantage of it because of their deeper experience in engineering , manufacturing , marketing and sales			1
there is no point in waiting while @entity81 upstarts catch up , they say			1
the @entity21 state of @entity83 passed a law in june 2011 to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there			1
@entity32 tested one in 2012			1
in august 2013 , @entity65 responded to the @entity32 push by developing an s - class limousine which drove between @entity91 and @entity92 without any driver input			1
the 103 kilometer stretch is known as the @entity96 route , named after the driver of the first ever motorcar more than 125 years ago			1
but moving from test drives to marketable products was held back by @entity100 8 of the @entity101 , which stipulates : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			1
' the amendment agreed last month by the @entity34 on @entity35 would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			1
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			2
provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles , all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws			1
the convention covers @entity2 countries , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , although not the @entity21 , @entity54 or @entity55			1
what @entity32 's car sees : an interior view of a @entity32 self - driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to ' see ' the road			2
the amendment was submitted by the governments of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity15 , @entity129 and @entity130 , according to the april 17 @entity9 document - showing just how important the new technology is for @entity2			1
@entity15 's premium carmakers in particular have business models that rely on leading the market in vehicles with the most sophisticated features available			2
they ca n't afford to fall behind			2
@entity139 , @entity65 , @entity140 as well as auto suppliers @entity141 and @entity142 are working on technologies for autonomous or semi-autonomous cars			2
@entity65 has developed technology which can scan the road ahead and behind with cameras and radar , and prompt a vehicle to pull out and overtake a large truck without a driver having to touch the steering wheel			2
it now wants to introduce more automated driving features into its cars , such as automated parking , automatic stop - and - go driving in traffic and motorway driving functions			2
eventually , it hopes to have cars with elaborate self - driving software that can be easily updated - like an @entity161 - to take advantage of new technical capabilities or changes in the law			1
' we have developed a car that can drive autonomously			2
now the legal framework needs to follow suit , ' a @entity62 spokeswoman said			2
it would be hard to mistake the gold @entity174 450h cars that @entity32 has converted into self - driving prototypes for normal cars , primarily because of the roof - mounted laser sensor that revolves 10 times a second , gathering a 360 - degree view of the car 's @entity182 drivers who spot the self - driving car often swerve in front of it and tap on their brakes , hoping to gauge the @entity32 car 's reaction , according to the two @entity32 staffers in the car 's front seats			2
another favorite involves car drivers waving their hands in the air , in an attempt to get the @entity32 driver - seat staff member to take his or her own hands off the wheel and prove the car is really steering itself			2
' we just laugh at them , ' said one of the @entity32 staff members in the car			2
from the car 's backseat , the ride feels little different from sitting in a taxi			0
the car 's speed , the distance it maintains from the vehicle in front and its handling , for the most part , feel completely ordinary			0
changing lanes occasionally feels sharper than typical , and the car slowed down at a green light at one point until its sensors were able to ' read ' a traffic light that was apparently mounted at an odd @entity32 staff member in the driver 's seat never took control of the car , other than the initial passage through a speed bump - laden parking lot , and once again on arrival			0
@entity234 , @entity235 last week a fleet of @entity32 's robot cars ferried more than two dozen reporters around @entity239 , @entity81 , on tuesday , in 30 - minute ride - alongs that showcased their ability to automatically and safely navigate around city streets packed with cyclists , pedestrians and traffic signs			0
the demonstrations , along with a morning of press briefings by @entity32 managers developing the technology , marked the company 's most concerted effort to date to provide an up - close look at the cars conceived five years ago in its secretive @entity254			0
the public needs to understand that a self - driving car is ' not something that you need to fear but something you need to embrace , ' said @entity260 , a former @entity262 official who is now director of safety for @entity32 's self - driving car project			0
' we do find that when people experience it , we get remarkable results and responses , ' @entity264 said at the event at the @entity271 , during which @entity32 explained the technology that makes the cars work			0
sensors including radar and lasers create 3d maps of a self - driving car 's surroundings in real - time , while @entity32 's software sorts objects into four categories			0
these include moving vehicles , pedestrians , cyclists and static objects such as signs , curbs and parked cars			0
initially , the car ’s capabilities were fairly crude			0
a group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person			0
now , the technology can distinguish individuals , according to @entity32 spokeswoman @entity298			0
to deal with cyclists , engineers initially programmed the software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn			0
then they realised that most cyclists do n't use standard gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way			0
a camera peers out from the front grill of @entity32 's self - driving car in @entity239 , @entity81 , as @entity32 revealed exactly how the car works engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 miles ( 16,000 km ) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets , @entity298 said			0
the software projects a cyclist 's likely movements and plots the car 's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens			0
‘ a mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving , with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area , ’ @entity326 wrote			0
before recent breakthroughs , @entity32 had considered mapping all the world 's stop signs			0
now the technology can read stop signs , including those held in the hands of school crossing guards , @entity298 added			0
@entity32 will not say whether it will build its own cars or license the technology to automakers , nor will it provide a firm date for when the cars will be available			0
co-founder @entity348 has said the technology could be available by 2017			0
@entity32 's cars have never ' caused ' an accident in self - driving mode , although they have been involved in a few fender benders , such as an incident in which a @entity32 car stopped at a red light got rear - ended , said @entity326 , the head of @entity32 's self - driving car project			0
unlike human drivers , self - driving cars never get drowsy behind the wheel , and they can react to unforeseen situations much more quickly , he said .			0
