by @entity0 a @entity2 couple renovated a home to look like the multicolored house seen in @entity5 - and the neighbors are n't having it			1
@entity7 and @entity8 spent over two years working on their 1891 @entity11 @entity10 home , @entity13 reports , and say they did it for their daughters , ages 3 and 1 - and - a - half			1
' they love the movie " @entity19 " and we just thought we 'd give them something fun to be proud of and actually all the kids in the neighborhood really love the colors , ' @entity7 told the station			2
' we 're trying to build a home for our daughters and our family			2
and that 's what our intention was			0
' neighbors told the station they were upset that the couple 's home , located on the oldest street in the city and part of the @entity41 area , does n't stick with a more traditional look like other @entity11 homes - any of which are over 100 years old			1
' i do n't think it fits in , ' neighbor @entity63 , a member of the @entity64 , told the station			2
' it really , in my opinion , is atrocious that this @entity11 is a gracious old lady and it 's being painted up to look like a clown			1
' look familiar ? @entity7 and @entity8 's home was painted to resemble the home seen in @entity5 film @entity19 , pictured colorful : other homes in the neighborhood have a more traditional look ' atrocious ' : one neighbor was harsh in his review of the @entity80 home 's new color scheme remodeled : the couple 's 1891 home , seen here before it was made over the couple faced a bumpy road after they placed a bid on their 1891 dream home in 2011 , the @entity83 reported last year			1
the trouble began when the city 's @entity89 , which is consulted on similar projects , became upset it was n't contacted by the @entity10 planning department , which approved the couple 's renovation plans			1
over 100 people signed a petition asking why the commission had not been included , the paper says , before the situation became a full - blown controversy			0
in june 2013 , it adds that police had to remove a neighbor that was protesting at the couple 's home			2
not long after , @entity106 spoke at a town meeting quoting the @entity108			0
' all we 've been shown are vitriol , attacks , harassment , and yes , even threats of violence , ' he said			0
@entity115 , another neighbor in the community , recently said he had a more moderate take on the unique home			0
' i like historical houses to be historical , ' he told @entity13			0
' but on the other hand , it 's his house and i feel that sometime down the line it 's going to be repainted again anyway			0

parents @entity7 and @entity8 repainted their @entity11 home for their two daughters
neighbors are upset the home , located in @entity10 's @entity41 area , does n't have a more traditional look
home is on oldest street in the city , and many *nearby* *victorians* are over 100 years old
*resident* @entity63 called the home ' atrocious ' and an old lady ' painted up to look like a clown '
