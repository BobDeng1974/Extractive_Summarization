by @entity0 last updated at 2:56 pm on 4th january 2012 a traveller who entered the @entity3 from @entity4 without a passport was let over the @entity3 border - after presenting officials with a scanned document on his @entity9			1
@entity11 had driven from his home in @entity13 before realising half an hour from the border he did not have his passport			1
mr @entity11 , 33 , instead told an official at @entity17 he was heading to @entity3 to drop off @entity19 gifts for his friend 's children , before presenting a scanned passport and driver 's licence on the @entity26 device			1
allowed in : @entity11 used his @entity9 showing his passport before being let over the @entity3 border but rather than demand he drive two hours home to fetch the hard copies of his documents , border officials spent several minutes studying the photos on his @entity9 before allowing him over the border last week			1
mr @entity11 said : ' i thought i 'd at least give it a try			1
he took the @entity9 into the little border hut			2
' he kind of gave me a stare , like neither impressed nor amused			2
' he was in there a good five , six minutes			0
it seemed like an eternity			0
when he came back he took a good long pause before wishing me a @entity19			0
' i think a good part of it had to do with the fact that it was the holidays and i seem like a nice - enough person			0
' @entity17 says it will accept documentation such as a passport , an enhanced driver 's licence or a @entity54 pass from @entity4 citizens entering at land crossings			2
the list does n't mention facsimiles , such as scans and photocopies			0
mr @entity11 said border officials studied his @entity9 for several minutes before allowing him into the country a spokeswoman for the department did not immediately respond to questions tuesday on whether scanned passports are also commonly accepted at @entity3 points of entry			1
professor @entity69 , a border - security expert from @entity70 , said mr. @entity11 's experience is likely one of many unspoken exceptions carried out at @entity3 border crossings			1
' there is some wiggle room , ‚Äù said @entity76 , a political geographer at the @entity78 , @entity79 , university			0
' what it suggests is that this whole standardization process is a little bit of a shell game because we 're told it 's not about individuals , it 's about data sets			0
but sometimes the experience is very individual			0

@entity11 showed documents on @entity26 device
