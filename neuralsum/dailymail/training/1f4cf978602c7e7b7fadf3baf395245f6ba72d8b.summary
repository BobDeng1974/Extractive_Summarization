two thirds of bright teenagers are missing out on key academic gcses , school league tables reveal			1
more than 111,000 of the 177,000 children who shone in tests at the age of 11 have gone on to study the softer subjects often shunned by employers			0
while all pupils must study @entity11 , maths and science , the tables suggest schools are steering youngsters toward drama , sociology and vocational qualifications – which are seen as easier to do well in – for their remaining subjects			1
schools minister @entity20 ( right ) said : ' children only have one chance at education			1
these tables show which schools are letting children down ' less than four in ten pupils across the state sector sit a gcse in foreign languages , while just under half opt for geography or history			1
the @entity33 has introduced a new measure to check how many pupils score grades a * to @entity37 in @entity11 , maths and science , as well as a language and a humanities subject such as history or geography			1
before the introduction of this ‘ @entity45 ’ , the measure was five good grades in maths and @entity11 and in any three other subjects			1
the tables published yesterday show the success rate for thousands of state schools plunged when the @entity45 was taken into account			1
one school scored 92 per cent on the old measure but just 6 per cent on the new			0
the tables also revealed how low , medium and high achievers performed in their gcses last year			2
among the pupils who had surpassed expectations in national curriculum tests at 11 , 62.8 per cent – 111,437 – failed to achieve the @entity45			2
less than half of this 177,447 - strong cohort had been entered for all the @entity45 subjects in the first place			2
in 285 schools , not a single high achiever gained the award			2
thousands of bright pupils are also effectively going backward in @entity11 and maths at secondary school			1
some 22,713 – 12.8 per cent – are not making the progress expected of them in @entity11 and 26,262 – 14.8 per cent – are not improving sufficiently in maths			1
@entity73 , a former headmaster and chairman of the @entity75 , said bright children were ‘ clearly being failed ’			0
he added : ‘ this is a betrayal of a generation of children who are not being prepared for the 21st century and they ’re not being prepared to help sustain this country with the economic challenges it faces			2
‘ it ’s failing children and damaging the country			2
the consequences will be found out in five , ten years ’ time when we ’re not producing the engineers and the scientists but we are producing the media studies students			0
’ professor @entity93 , director of the @entity94 at @entity95 , said : ‘ the emphasis in recent years has been getting as many children as possible up to the floor targets and we have n’t been giving enough attention to our brightest pupils			0
‘ it ’s important that young people study the core subjects because that keeps their options open			0
‘ within our system , where schools have been judged in terms of gcse points , it ’s been too easy and too tempting for young people to drift away from the subjects that would be in their best interests			2
’ schools minister @entity20 said : ‘ children only have one chance at education			1
these tables show which schools are letting children down			2
heads should be striving to make improvements year on year , and we will not let schools coast with mediocre performance			0
‘ we are driving up standards right across the board			0
’ leap in results : @entity128 , principal of @entity129 in @entity130 , which was the most improved in the country 2011 ’s bottom school was @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136 ( left ) , which saw just 3 % of its 115 candidates gain five gcses at grades @entity37 and above			1
the most improved school was @entity141 ( right ) in @entity142 , @entity130			0
last year , 80 % of pupils achieved five or more gcses at grade c and above , compared with just 26 % in 2008 the figures showed that 45.6 per cent of ‘ medium ’ achievers – almost 120,000 – who reached the standard expected of their age in national curriculum tests aged 11 failed to get five good grades in subjects including @entity11 and maths			1
more than 2,800 of the nation ’s 3,000 schools had fewer than half their pupils gaining the @entity45 standard as well			1
teenagers at selective schools were almost five times as likely to achieve the @entity45 than pupils in comprehensives			1
the figures were 68.1 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively , according to data released by the @entity167			0
at @entity169 , in @entity170 , @entity171 , pupils followed a traditional curriculum long before the @entity45 was announced in september 2010			0
headmistress @entity173 said : ‘ we are a selective school and have very bright , motivated students			0
we have for some time run a curriculum with a very academic focus			0
it ’s not a response we made to the @entity45			0
we did maintain a modern foreign language when the compulsion to do so was removed			0
’ the bottom school in the 2011 results was @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136			0
just 3 per cent of the 115 candidates gained five gcses including @entity11 and maths at grades @entity37 and above .			1

just 33.9 % of teenagers from *disadvantaged* homes gained at least five @entity192 in their gcses last *summer* - including @entity11 and maths - compared with 58.2 % of all pupils attending state schools
yet again , selective schools dominate top of the tables
schools minister @entity20 : ' today ’s figures reveal a shocking waste of *talent* in many schools across the country '
