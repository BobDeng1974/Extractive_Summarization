by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 13 july 2012 cheeky postcards were once part and parcel of any trip to the seaside			2
but in one @entity9 tourist resort , giant - sized versions of the risque cards are stirring up controversy			1
traders in the town of @entity13 are calling for the larger - than - life , politically incorrect postcards to be taken down			1
nostalgic : the signs were installed for the @entity13 in @entity18 display but now look set to be taken down controversy : traders in @entity13 have reacted furiously to the unveiling of the postcards on the seafront the posters had originally been put on display to welcome judges to the annual ' @entity13 in @entity18 ' floral show due to be held at the end of july			1
however , shopkeepers say the nostalgic cards - stationed on council - owned land - are lowering the reputation of the seaside town			2
angry : local shop owner , @entity35 , pictured , says that the postcards belong in the past @entity37 , 47 , who runs an equestrian shop , said : ' how would you explain these sort of jokes to your five year old grandchild ? they are so sexist and rude			1
' they have really put people ’s backs up			2
they are bad for business and we should have been consulted before anything was put up there anyway			2
' a caption on one of the postcards , showing a man ogling two girls in bikinis , reads : ' looking at the lovely birds '			2
whilst another shows one angler saying to another ' that ’s what i call a catch ' as a woman walks past in a skimpy swim suit			0
shock : one shopkeeper says she wants the postcards taken down as she will find it impossible to explain them to her grandchild traditional ? the giant - sized postcards have been defended by a spokesman for @entity13 in @entity18 who said that one ( pictured right ) even promotes recycling @entity77 , 38 , who runs a gallery and picture framing business directly opposite the display , also said he found the postcards inappropriate : ' the one with the dog is just obscene and the rest are sexist			1
' i have got an eight year old boy and do n’t know how i would explain some of them to him			0
' they may be 1950s postcards but i do not think they have any place at all in a family resort			1
humour : once a staple of the @entity9 seaside , traders are now up in arms over the saucy postcards ' i would term them obscene and i must have had sixty or seventy complaints already from customers			1
' a lot of children come in and out of these shops and we are trying to encourage families to come down here to enjoy the scenery and support local businesses			0
' they are certainly not going to enjoy these			0
i would say it ’s beyond a joke but there ’s no joke to it as far as i can see			0
' and , following the complaints , it looks as though the giant postcards - designed by a local artist based on original images - will have to be removed			2
ironically , in 1954 , @entity13 was chosen by the @entity120 government of the day to lead a crackdown on rude postcards amid concerns about declining public morals			1
local police raided seventeen shops and seized thousands of cards to prepare a case under the 1857 @entity129 against illustrator @entity130 , who worked for @entity131 ’s , the manufacturer of the postcards			1
mr @entity130 pleaded not guilty but was convicted at a trial at @entity135 and fined £ 50 with £ 25 costs			0
@entity131 ’s appeared to have the last laugh though - going on to sell some 200 million postcards			1
the company 's current managing director @entity139 hit back furiously at the calls to take down the signs			1
he said : ' it seems the po - faced tradition continues to this day in @entity13			2
' it would be really said if the placards have to be taken down			0
there is enough gloom and doom about at the moment			0
' it is really unusual for these cards to upset anyone			0
our images have been in every national paper and tv and we hardly ever get a complaint			0
conventional : a non-controversial @entity13 in @entity18 sign put up to welcome judges for the floral competition later this month ' my message would be , to those in @entity13 who have complained , is to get a life and start making their visitors smile			1
people love this stuff and still do			0
' ' @entity13 in @entity18 ' vice chairman @entity171 insisted the postcards were merely intended as ' a bit of fun '			1
he said : ' attitudes have changed since 1954 , thank goodness , so it ’s a shame people have taken the wrong attitude but the last thing we want to do is offend local people			0
' i can see in today ’s climate it could be considered sexist but was meant as a bit of fun			2
' you can still buy saucy postcards in @entity13 and all over the country and most people do not take offence			1
' some people think it lowers the tone of the resort and we should be promoting a more sophisticated image			0
' well , a lot of people in the resort like traditional things like funfair rides and i remember these cards from when i was a little boy			0
' two of the posters were also promoting public messages about recycling and clearing up after pets , he added .			0

the risque postcards , *inspired* by *classic* versions from the 1950s , were put up to celebrate @entity13 ' floral display and impress judges
shopkeepers have *slammed* the designs , however , branding them ' obscene ' , ' sexist ' and ' rude '
managing director of @entity131 's , the company which sold *200million* of the postcards , hit back and told complaining traders to ' get a life '
