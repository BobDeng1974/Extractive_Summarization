the plot that turned into @entity2 ’s biggest match - fixing scandal was hatched between @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 in late 2012 and was blown apart last september when 10 people , including a group of @entity9 footballers , were arrested in @entity10 for alleged involvement in throwing games			1
in the days and weeks running up to the bust , police had almost outnumbered fans at some games played by a local league side , @entity17 , watching and listening for evidence of manipulation			1
emboldened by new laws , which meant they could wire - tap suspects ’ phones , they had also bugged the club , including the pitch and even the goalposts			0
they collected evidence including calls arranging fixes , discussions about cash transfers and yells between team - mates during play along the lines : ‘ let this one in ! ’ guilty : @entity35 ( left ) was fined £ 675 and @entity36 ( right ) was fined £ 1,126 after pleating guilty of fixing scandal : @entity39 soccer players @entity36 ( centre ) and @entity35 ( right ) leave court in @entity10 the state police in @entity43 duly laid fixing charges			1
prosecutions have unfolded over the past eight months and convictions have been secured across a series of court dates , now drawing to a close			0
four @entity9 footballers pleaded guilty to fixing with the @entity17 and three have been punished , all with fines			1
@entity35 , a 24 - year - old goalkeeper , was fined £ 675			1
ringleader : @entity53 , involved in the global match - fixing scam involving players at the @entity17 @entity56 @entity36 , a 24 - year - old defender , was fined £ 1,126			1
@entity57 , a 25 - year - old defender , was fined £ 1,700			1
@entity58 , 27 , a midfielder , is scheduled to have a sentencing hearing this month			0
the four have all been banned for life from football by @entity63			2
as recently as spring of last year , they were all playing in @entity9 , in the 2012 - 13 @entity65 season			1
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity58 were at @entity66 and @entity57 at @entity67			2
@entity53 , a @entity5 - based @entity68 , was given a three - year prison sentence in april for his ringleader role			1
the @entity17 ’ @entity72 coach , @entity71 , was given a suspended four - month sentence and a £ 1,700 fine this month			1
the court proceedings in @entity10 heard the @entity75 were nominally ‘ hired ’ via a firm called @entity77 ( @entity78 )			0
documents at @entity80 in @entity81 show it was registered in december 2012 to an address in @entity84 , @entity85			0
the sole owner - director was a @entity87 man of @entity89 heritage called @entity90 , from @entity3			0
he had previously lived for almost 10 years near @entity91			0
@entity90 was tracked going in and out of @entity2 during the fixing at @entity17 but left the country before he could be apprehended			2
it transpired he was in cahoots with a major international match - fixer , @entity97			2
@entity78 was nothing much more than a shell , a front to pretend it was hiring footballers for legitimate jobs			0
it was never based in @entity84 , never filed accounts and was struck off as a company a few weeks ago			0
the @entity9 players ’ stories act as a cautionary tale of how easy it is to fall into bad company and illegal behaviour			2
their football careers are over , although they can consider themselves fortunate they did not end up in prison			2
culprit : @entity5 match - fixer , @entity97 , responsible for hundreds of fixed matches under new laws introduced last year in @entity43 , those guilty of match - fixing can be handed jail terms of up to 10 years			1
associates of the convicted players say they regret what happened but the players themselves have either declined to talk or not responded to requests to do so			0
@entity90 ’s identity has only briefly been aired in public in relation to @entity2			0
anyone who recognises his name probably does so because he was arrested in @entity9 last november for fixing - related activity here and in june was sent to prison for five years for that			1
the president of @entity17 , @entity136 , was first approached by email in 2012 with an offer of five free @entity9 players and a free coach , as part of a package where the providers would hope to bring sponsorship to the club and make money			1
he told local media later : ‘ our committee members are thinking , “ oh beautiful , five players for free , we ’re not going to pay anything , it ’s a big , big bonus ”			2
’ sentencing : @entity57 ( left ) , a 25 - year - old defender , was fined £ 1,700			1
@entity58 ( right ) , 27 , a midfielder , is scheduled to have a sentencing hearing this month he did not suspect anything , he told police			0
the state of @entity43 was probably about the worst place in the world last summer to embark on a fixing venture			0
first , new legislation had just come into force which gave police powers that included allowing ‘ intrusive ’ surveillance			0
second , a @entity166 - based monitoring company with @entity81 offices , @entity168 , had been tracking odd movements of players from @entity9 to @entity2 , via paid - for holidays in @entity172 , then irregular betting and results			1
the court was told that @entity36 said to police he once got a call on the sidelines during play from a fixer saying : ‘ this result better f * * king happen ’ and so he walked behind @entity35 ’s goal to urge him to concede again			2
‘ let the next one in , ’ he yelled on one occasion			0
the players ’ travel costs to @entity2 and accommodation was covered by the fixers , plus about £ 1,000 per month each for expenses , plus £ 1,500 per fix			2
it is estimated the players cost about £ 15,000 each for the duration , maximum			0
yet sources say that the @entity5 - based fixing syndicate behind the scam made about £ 1.2m profit from the venture , or about £ 200,000 per match			1
it seemed easy money , in an obscure league , unlikely to be noticed			0
@entity90 @entity90 @entity87 citizen of @entity89 heritage who was jailed in june for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in @entity9 in november 2013			0
former long - term resident of north @entity81 , near @entity91 , and latterly @entity3 , he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in @entity2 last year			2

@entity65 2012 - 13 @entity224 made public announcement in march 2013 , reminding 22 clubs of ‘ responsibilities ’ after suspicious betting patterns , and a dossier from experts identified clubs , games and players believed to be involved in match manipulation			2
no investigation after police declined to get involved			0
@entity237 , @entity2 the biggest fixing scandal in @entity72 history unfolded a year ago at @entity17 in @entity10			1
convictions have been secured for a group of fixers controlled by a @entity5 - based syndicate , including four @entity9 players , all former @entity65 players			1
various matches in @entity9 , nov 2013 @entity90 and associate @entity211 , a @entity5 fixer , were jailed in june 2014 at @entity247 after being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit bribery in a case that centred on @entity9 football matches played in november 2013			1
