by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 24 october 2013 newspaper bosses last night announced plans to mount an extraordinary legal challenge to plans to impose on the press a @entity5 written by politicians			0
they are to argue that the government ’s handling of a rival @entity5 proposed by the newspaper and magazine industry was unlawful			1
industry bodies – through the @entity13 , which funds the existing regulatory system – are to apply to the @entity15 for judicial review			1
industry bodies , through the @entity13 , will apply to the @entity15 for a judicial review they will argue a decision by the @entity20 , a secretive body of ministers which advises the @entity23 , to reject an industry - backed charter in favour of one agreed behind closed doors by the three main political parties , should be quashed			1
earlier this month , politicians agreed the detail of their own charter designed to oversee newspaper regulation in the wake of the @entity34 into media standards			1
an alternative proposal put forward by the @entity13 , which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £ 1million for wrongdoing , up - front corrections , with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently , and independence from the industry and politicians , was rejected			1
planning minister @entity47 suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the government has handled the issue it is thought to be the first time the @entity23 has been asked to sign a @entity5 imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry			2
one close ally of the prime minister , planning minister @entity47 , suggested newspapers should refuse to cooperate and mount a legal challenge against the way the government has handled the issue			0
the @entity65 magazine has already announced it will refuse to take part in regulation overseen by the politicians ’ charter and take its chances in the courts			2
the government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘ exemplary ’ damages and punitive costs in libel and privacy cases			0
however , senior figures including @entity80 , an eminent @entity81 who is the architect of reforms to the libel laws , have suggested that would violate article 10 of the @entity87 , which protects freedom of expression			0
this week , an international coalition of free speech groups warned that the ‘ repressive ’ plans to regulate @entity94 ’s 300 - year - old free press will undermine the country ’s international standing and the reputation of the @entity23			2
the warning was signed by the @entity99 , the @entity100 and the @entity101 among others			0
lord @entity103 , chairman of the @entity13 , said : ‘ the decision by the government and the @entity20 on this matter has enormous ramifications for free speech both here in the @entity94 , and – because of our leadership role in the @entity101 and developing world – across the globe			1
politicians agreed the detail of their own charter designed to oversee newspaper regulation in the wake of the @entity34 lord @entity103 , chairman of the @entity13 , said the government 's decision has ' enormous ramifications for free speech ' ‘ the government and the @entity20 should have applied the most rigorous standards of consultation and examination of the @entity5 proposed by the industry , which would have enshrined tough regulatory standards at the same time as protecting press freedom			1
‘ they singularly failed to do so , and that is why – as the issues at stake are so extraordinarily high – we are having to take this course of action			0
’ the mayor of london @entity134 backed the move by the newspapers			2
he told the @entity139 : ‘ the state has no business trying to regulate the content of newspapers			0
in @entity145 they would n’t dream of doing it , so why do it here ? ‘ a free press is the bedrock of democracy and any @entity5 needs to be fully and properly consulted on – anything less risks outcomes that threaten those freedoms			0
’ the industry will argue that despite repeated requests , the @entity20 refused to discuss what criteria they used to judge its charter until after it had decided to reject it			1
it claims that the application was not dealt with fairly , that the press had a right to be consulted which the @entity105 and the @entity20 failed to do , and that the procedures deployed were ‘ irrational ’			1
in a separate announcement , industry representatives announced a final set of plans to set up a new @entity169			0
@entity170 , chairman of the industry group which has drawn up the plans and executive director of @entity175 , said after nine months of work and consultation a ‘ tough , independent and effective regulator ’ was in sight .			0

industry bodies , through @entity181 , are to apply to the @entity15 for judicial review
will argue against @entity20 decision to reject industry - backed charter
