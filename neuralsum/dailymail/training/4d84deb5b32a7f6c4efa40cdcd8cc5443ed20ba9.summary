by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 29 march 2013 a @entity2 shuttle carrying a former @entity3 who has been honoured for his bravery in @entity6 has successfully docked with the @entity7 this morning			2
the @entity9 capsule carrying astronauts @entity11 of the @entity12 and @entity2 @entity13 and @entity14 linked up with the space station at 2.28am			1
it brings the size of the crew at the @entity2 @entity20 research module , which was located over the @entity21 , just off @entity22 , when the team docked , to six			0
stunning : this image shows the view from the @entity9 as it approaches the @entity7			0
it linked up with the space station at 2.28am @entity13 , 59 , who had been in space in 1997 and 2006 , was heard saying on @entity28 : ' it 's such a beautiful sight , hard to believe my eyes			1
' the incoming crew will spend five months in space before returning to @entity34			2
the trio who arrived at the space station this morning includes former navy seal lieutenant commander @entity11 - on his second mission into space			1
the 43 - year - old served four six - month deployments to @entity6 and two to the @entity43 as a @entity3			0
his dedicated service earned him two @entity45 for leading a nine - day operation at the @entity48 cave complex in @entity6			0
once the capsule reached the station , the trio had to wait two hours for the pressure to equalize before they were allowed to enter			1
action man : cassidy waves as he walks to the @entity9 spacecraft and , right , as a @entity3 who served with distinction in @entity6 ' hey , is anyone home ? ' joked @entity13 as he floated into the station			1
@entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14 were greeted with cheers and hugs by @entity12 @entity64 , @entity2 @entity65 and @entity67 @entity66 , who have been at the station since december			1
the astronauts then had a brief session with @entity70 outside @entity71 , talking with friends and relatives			0
' you 're such a star ! i 'm really proud of you ! ' @entity14 's tearful mother said			1
the 35 - year - old @entity2 is on his first flight into space			2
their mission began with a late - night launch from the @entity2 - leased @entity84 launch pad in @entity85			2
it was the first time a space crew has taken such a direct route to the orbiting lab. @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14 are the first crew to reach the station after only four orbits instead of the standard 50 - hour flight to reach the station			1
the @entity96 rocket booster with @entity98 space ship takes off carrying @entity11 and his crew mates to the @entity7 the new maneuver was tested successfully by three @entity2 progress cargo ships , unmanned versions of the @entity9 used to ferry supplies to the space station			1
@entity2 cosmonauts have described the two - day approach maneuver in the cramped @entity9 as one of the most grueling parts of missions			0
@entity13 said at a pre-launch news conference that the shorter flight path would reduce the crew 's fatigue and allow the astronauts to be in top shape for the docking			1
@entity11 , who lives in @entity117 , @entity118 with his wife and their three children , was selected for the space program by @entity28 in 2004			1
astronaut training is among the toughest in the world , but @entity11 was more than prepared for it , having already gone through navy seal training			1
as a seal he underwent the infamous ' hell week , ' in which candidates only sleep four hours over 5 1/2 days while running up to 200 miles and physically training for 20 hours per day			2
@entity11 told @entity131 that all training that astronauts - and @entity3 - go through is for a very good reason			1
' i think just the training that i got in the field , training in the early part of my @entity3 career , and during my time being an astronaut will all combine together			0
' what i know from combat in the @entity3 , there ’s a sort of calmness that comes over people who are well - trained and know what to do			0
muscle memory kicks in , and it ’s not until after the thing is over that you realize what you went through , ' he said			0
the @entity3 has shown its support for @entity11 on social media platforms by posting this meme on the @entity7 , @entity11 will be doing experiments measuring bone mass , which will have applications for people facing osteoporosis			1
this is his second mission			2
in 2009 he was part of a mission to help install and complete components of the @entity167 and got to perform three spacewalks			2
he follows on the heels of other former seals to make it to space , including @entity7 expedition 1 commander @entity173			0
the @entity3 has shown its support for @entity11 on social media platforms by posting a meme of an astronaut with the wording : ‘ nothing beats an astronaut … except a @entity3 astronaut			2
’ the wording is a play on the popular @entity184 commercial that @entity185 is currently running featuring astronauts , a lifeguard and a fireman , to promote the @entity190 body spray for men by @entity192			0
@entity11 with his fellow crew - @entity2 cosmonauts @entity14 , right , and @entity13 , center the @entity98 lifted off from the @entity2 - leased @entity84 at 2:43 a.m. friday local time			1
the new maneuver has been tested successfully by three @entity2 progress cargo ships , an unmanned version of the @entity9 used to ferry supplies to the space station			1
@entity13 joked at a pre-launch news conference at @entity84 that the journey to the station would be so quick that it could allow the crew to even carry ice cream as a present to the three men currently manning the orbiting outpost			1
‘ it would n't melt in such a short time , ’ he said			0
the shorter flight path also reduces the crew 's fatigue and allow astronauts to be in top shape for the docking			0
@entity13 said that it takes about five hours for the human body to start feeling the impact of zero gravity , so the quicker flight would allow the crew to more easily adapt to weightlessness in much roomier space station interiors			1
the downside of the accelerated rendezvous is that the crew will have to stay in their spacesuits , which they don hours before the launch , through the entire approach maneuver			0
once on - board the @entity231 will be doing experiments measuring bone mass other @entity2 cosmonauts in the past have described the two - day approach maneuver in the cramped @entity9 as one of the most grueling parts of missions to the orbiting station			0
the spheroid orbiting capsule allows the crew to take off their bulky spacesuits , change into more comfortable clothes and use a toilet , but its interior is extremely confined			0
the ship 's spartan layout lacks adequate heating and fails to provide an opportunity for the crew to get hot food			0
it contrasts sharply with the spacious @entity12 space shuttle , whose retirement has left @entity9 as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost			2
@entity2 space officials said the longer approach was necessary at a time when the station was in a lower orbit required for the shuttle flights			1
after they ended , it was raised from 350 kilometers to 400 kilometers , making a quicker rendezvous possible			0
@entity28 is working on the development of its new generation @entity271 spacecraft			0
@entity271 's first trip is an unmanned mission in 2017 , and the first manned mission is set for 2021 .			0
