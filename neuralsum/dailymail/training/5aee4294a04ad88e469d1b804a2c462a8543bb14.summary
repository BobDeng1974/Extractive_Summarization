the wicketkeeping double act of @entity2 coaches @entity3 and @entity4 face a real test in deciding who to pick behind the stumps for the test series against @entity9			1
keepers may be taking over the @entity12 game - the @entity14 ’s managing director , @entity13 , is also a former gloveman - but it is the pivotal @entity8 wicketkeeper - batsman role that could be their biggest quandary			1
@entity2 want @entity19 to regain the all - important position he was forced to give up after the @entity21 were lost in @entity22 , but concerns are growing that he will not be fit in time for the first test at @entity25 on june 12			1
brains trust : ( from left ) @entity2 coaches @entity3 and @entity4 , and captain @entity28 expert opinion : @entity2 assistant coach @entity4 , like @entity3 , is a former wicketkeeper first - choice : @entity19 is @entity2 's best keeper - batsman option but may not be fit for the first test on june 12 prior has not kept wicket yet this season because of his chronic achilles condition and has not even been able to play as a specialist batsman since he scored a century in @entity36 ’s opening championship match			1
he has two more four - day games in which to prove his fitness and is adamant that he will be able to play in them - but if he does not come through it will be intriguing to see where @entity2 go next			2
@entity42 ’s @entity41 is the man in possession but appears to have gone backwards as a keeper and batsman since his brilliant display against @entity47 at @entity48 ’s two years ago and is recovering from a broken finger			1
@entity50 is one of the most exciting talents in the game and is a key figure in limited - overs formats but every time his name is mentioned in terms of test cricket there seems to come a shaking of heads and mutterings of ‘ not ready ’ from those in the know			1
@entity3 , the former @entity36 keeper , clearly believes @entity50 has test potential because he recruited him for @entity65 before he became @entity2 coach again but last week said that , for now , he saw his charge as a one - day performer only			1
staking his claim : @entity41 took over from @entity70 in @entity71 but has n't proved himself with the gloves talent : @entity50 is an exciting prospect but appears earmarked for limited overs honours only look beyond @entity50 and @entity41 and @entity2 could go anywhere			1
the modern trend for a batsman who keeps could see @entity2 look at @entity80 , whose presence at @entity82 led to @entity50 heading north , while the coming man , but not yet , could well be @entity85 ’s @entity84			1
unlucky : @entity87 's @entity86 is too good a player to have just seven caps as a keeper - batsman @entity90 seemed to have a golden opportunity to return to the @entity2 set - up this summer but his decision to give up the gloves and play as a batsman for @entity96 would appear to scupper those hopes			1
all of which brings us back to the man in the domestic game i consider most unfortunate not to have had a long career in international cricket			2
a man who has long been among the best keepers in the world and a batsman good enough to score 19 first - class hundreds			2
@entity86 , at 34 , is as good as ever and supremely fit			1
@entity87 feel so strongly about their captain that coach @entity112 contacted @entity3 this week to advocate @entity86 ’s test claims and , to me , it is little short of a scandal that he has earned just seven test caps , the last way back in 2002			1
so highly do @entity87 rate @entity86 that , @entity120 understands , they would be prepared to sacrifice the promising batsman - keeper @entity121 when his contract expires at the end of this season should they be forced to choose between him and @entity86			1
what ’s more , @entity86 could be the perfect short - term fix while @entity2 are waiting for @entity19 and if he should excel against @entity9 , so much the better			1
@entity2 should have no qualms in throwing him the gloves now			2
experience : @entity86 was @entity2 's @entity131 keeper in 2009 but has n't played a test since the 2002 ashes perfect solution : @entity86 's cool head could be an ideal short - term solution while prior got back to 100 per cent the good i had an opportunity during the one - day international in @entity140 to talk to @entity3 and was struck by his terrific enthusiasm			1
he is really looking forward to the @entity2 job			2
i ’m sure , second time around , he will be older and wiser and he came across very impressively			0
i know one or two senior players did n’t like ‘ the method ’ when @entity3 was coach last time but all this bloke wants to do is improve players and teams			0
encouraging : @entity148 ( right ) was impressed by @entity3 ' enthusiasm to improve @entity2 's players the bad i 'm sure everyone in cricket will spare a thought for @entity155 , who suddenly turned up in the @entity157 commentary box in @entity158 because he has n’t got a job any more			2
he is such a nice bloke and an excellent coach who has found himself on the outside looking in since losing his role as @entity2 ’s one - day coach last month			0
he did n’t have a bad word to say about anyone involved in his sacking , on or off air , and he wants to get back to normal with a job inside the game			0
the bottom line for both these guys is one simple word - results			0
outside looking in : @entity155 did n't have a bad word to say about anyone with regards to his sacking @entity177 , seen as one of the best young coaches until his fall at @entity96 , was set to quit cricket before @entity9 resurrected his career			1
now he ’s plotting @entity2 ’s downfall			0
@entity177 , who was captain of the @entity36 side that won the @entity185 under @entity3 , will spar with his old mentor after @entity9 asked him to replace coach @entity4 , who will act as consultant to @entity3			1
@entity177 , sacked by @entity96 last year , said : ‘ i was at the point where i was considering doing something away from cricket			0
i had given myself a set period of time			0
by the time the @entity12 season started , i was thinking , “ at some stage you need to look at other things ”			2
@entity196 - to - head : former @entity96 coach @entity177 is consulting for @entity9 against his former coach @entity3 switch : @entity177 will give the @entity131 side the insight they would have received from @entity4 , who 's now with the @entity2 camp ‘ and i might still do that			1
the one thing the last year has taught me is that , as passionate and committed as you can be to sport , perhaps there is more to life than cricket			0
there ’s a big world out there and lots of business opportunities			0
’ @entity177 , 44 , will give @entity9 the inside knowledge that they would have received from @entity217			1
@entity177 said : ‘ i could never have imagined a few weeks ago i ’d be assisting the @entity219 champions on the tour of @entity2			0
‘ @entity221 played a huge role in my career			0
this gives me a few weeks to see how he ’s operating			0
we grew a very strong bond and his appointment was no surprise to me			0
if anyone was going to get two chances with @entity2 it was going to be @entity3			0
‘ i am confident that @entity2 have appointed the best coach in the country			0
it will now be down to the impact he and the players have as to whether it ’s successful but the combination of @entity3 and @entity217 is a good one			0
’ we have heard all the hype and seen the promotional videos			0
now we will find out if the @entity14 ’s revamped @entity241 can compete with the @entity242 and @entity243 when it is relaunched on friday night			0
regular friday and weekend fixtures will help but the suspicion remains that @entity2 have fallen way behind in the form of the sport they gave to the world because of the domestic game ’s refusal to embrace the franchise system			2
this season will decide whether @entity131 is still sufficiently attractive with 18 counties rather than , say , eight city teams			2
new - look : representatives from all the counties competing in the revamped @entity259 , starting on friday			0

@entity19 's *injury* and @entity41 's form present a selection quandry
prior may not be fit for the first test against @entity9 at @entity25 on june 12
the @entity36 *veteran* has n't kept wicket this season *due* an @entity271 problem
former @entity8 keeper @entity86 's name should be considered *favourably* *alongside* *contenders* @entity50 , @entity80 and @entity84
@entity86 's in top form for @entity87 and fit as ever at 34 years of age
