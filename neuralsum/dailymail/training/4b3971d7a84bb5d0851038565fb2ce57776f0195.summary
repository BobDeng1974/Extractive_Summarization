nearly half of all @entity2 lack economic security and seriously struggle to make ends meet , a report has found			1
a staggering 45 per cent of @entity2 citizens live above the federal poverty threshold - but do not have enough money to cover their housing , food , healthcare and other basic expenses			1
it breaks down to 39 per cent of all adults and 55 per cent of all children			2
destitute : nearly half of all @entity2 lack economic security and seriously struggle to make ends meet , a report has found ( stock photo ) ' this is a wake - up call for @entity22 , for our state policy - makers , really for all of us , ' said @entity25 , president and ceo of advocacy group @entity28 for women 's survey , which carried out the survey			1
she added : ' nearly half of our nation 's families can not cover the costs of basic expenses even when they do have a job			1
' under these conditions , cuts to unemployment insurance and other programmes families are relying on right now would push them from crisis to catastrophe			2
' the @entity44 survey compared 2009 pre-tax incomes to a budget of basic and essential monthly expenses for various families that it developed along with researchers at @entity50			1
for example , in a budget for a family of one worker , it put housing expenses at $ 688 and food at $ 244			1
in a family of two workers with two young children , it assumed housing would cost $ 821 per month and food $ 707 a month			2
it did not include non-essentials such as holidays , recreation , hobbies , college tuition , and other common expenses of the middle class			2
a congressional effort to find $ 1.2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years failed on monday , raising fears that emergency benefits for the long - term unemployed would not be extended when they expire next month			2
other social programmes including @entity77 are also under threat as lawmakers seek to slash the nation 's huge debt			0
some economists said that while they agreed the debt had to be reduced , targeting programmes that helped the low income group survive the harsh economic environment was not the correct path to take			0
' i am in favour of austerity , but not in this area , ' said @entity92 , chief @entity2 economist at @entity94 in @entity95			1
' this is the only austerity going on and this is hitting the long - term unemployed			0
it 's not improving the long - term budget situation anyway			0
' currently , the poverty threshold for the @entity2 is an annual income of $ 22,314 for a family of four			1
a little more than 15 per cent of the country lives at or below that level , and the group wanted to look at the remainder , ' many of whom live on the edge and are chronically at risk of financial crisis or falling into poverty '			0
more than four out of 10 adult women live in households that can not cover those basic expenses , slightly more than the proportion of men , 37 per cent			1
that may be because in 2009 women 's median earnings were 70 per cent of men 's median earnings , the group said			0
more than 60 percent of single women live in economic insecurity , it added			0
' while married women are more likely to have economic security than unmarried women , much of the stability is attained through a husband 's earnings or other household income , ' the group reported , which can put those women in economic jeopardy if their husbands die or lose their job or if the couple divorces			0
the group also found ' that full - time work fails to provide economic security for 25 per cent of adult workers , ' because of stagnating and falling wages over the last decade			0
' a chief cause of economic insecurity is 1970s level wages that fail to cover modern expenses , ' it said			1
while households with two full - time workers can help boost a family 's economic security , 22 per cent of adults with children who work full - time and have a partner who also has a full - time job can not cover basic needs			1
at the same time , 21 per cent of homes headed by a college graduate lack economic security			0
' in the past , threats to economic security were supposedly clear - dropping out of high school , being a single parent or having a large family			0
in today 's economy , we can not assume we know who lacks security , ' it said .			0
