@entity0 have snapped up 20 - year - old defender @entity1 , who was released by @entity2 this summer			1
but , having announced the move on @entity5 himself , no - one seems to know that much about the player			0
here , @entity8 reveals all ... what happened at @entity2 for them to let him go ? he signed as a full - time scholar in 2010 when he turned 16 and joined the club with a lot of promise			1
youth coaches there had high hopes that he 'd push on and break through into the senior team			0
that was why he was called into first - team squads as a teenager , making the bench for a @entity26 game against @entity27 in 2011			1
move : @entity1 was released by @entity2 in the summer but has signed for @entity0 was there any attitude problem there then ? not at all , by the sounds of it			1
one source who knows the player said : ' he was popular amongst his age group and very polite			0
there were never any issues there , he got on with everyone			0
' but why have @entity0 picked up a player deemed not good enough for @entity2 ? the key link in all this is @entity0 's under 21 coach @entity43 , who used to be a youth coach at ... @entity2			2
@entity43 was at the north @entity46 club from 2006 - 2012 when @entity47 signed him as part of his coaching staff			2
it is thought that @entity43 has been instrumental in the signing of @entity1			2
tweet : 20 - year - old defender @entity1 took to @entity5 to announce the deal himself dream come true : @entity1 wearing a @entity0 strip as a kid as he mentioned in his tweet what 's he like as a player ? @entity1 has been described by those who know him as ' energetic ' and ' a solid defender ' who very rarely makes mistakes but can lapse in concentration at times			1
he can play across the back , on the left or right flank or as a centre half			0
last season , wearing the no 59 shirt , he was used predominantly as a centre - back			0
he is 5ft 7ins , so not exactly the tallest of players , and his height would suggest he is more suited to full - back			0
run : @entity1 can play on the left , right or in the centre , even though he is n't the tallest at 5ft 7ins strength : @entity1 is known as ' energetic ' and a ' solid defender ' that has potential to get better did he achieve anything at @entity2 ? @entity1 was part of the @entity2 squad who won the @entity85 21 @entity84 three years ago and was also a regular in the side who beat @entity0 in the quarter - finals of the 2011/12 next gen competition			1
that will have been another occasion when he came under @entity0 's radar			0
earlier in the tournament they also smashed @entity97 7 - 1 , with @entity1 in the side			2
left : @entity2 let @entity1 go , meaning the youngster has moved to @entity100 and left @entity46 winner : @entity1 has been on @entity0 's radar for some time and has done well in @entity2 ' youth team @entity104 ' excited ' by signings			1

@entity1 signed two - year deal at @entity108 after being released by @entity2
