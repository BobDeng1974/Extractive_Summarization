eating only within an eight - hour window each day could help you shed weight , a study has found			1
limiting the times you eat could reverse obesity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes			1
and it does n’t even matter whether you have fatty or sugary foods			0
the eight - hour limit seems to undo the harm done by an unhealthy diet			1
researchers believe that sticking to strict meal times allows the body to predict when it will eat – meaning it is better prepared to burn calories			1
even when obese mice had their eating window reduced to nine hours , they were able to drop 5 per cent of their body weight within a few days – while still enjoying the same amount of calories			1
the research was carried out at the @entity37 in @entity38			2
the scientists think that allowing the body to predict regular meal times helps it synchronise the digestive system with genes and proteins , preparing it to process food			1
it also affects the balance of bacteria found in the gut which control metabolism			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity54 , add to mounting evidence that when we eat is just as important to health as what we eat			0
professor @entity59 , who led the study , said : ‘ most of the advice is , “ you have to change nutrition , you have to eat a healthy diet			0
” but many people do n’t have access to healthy diets			2
‘ so the question is , without access to a healthy diet , can they still practise time - restricted feeding and reap some benefit ? ’ he added : ‘ we found that animals fed within a window of eight to 12 hours had a number of protective and therapeutic health benefits compared with animals allowed to eat the same number of calories from the same food source at any time			2
’ the protective effects were maintained even during ‘ cheat days ’ – when the mice were allowed unrestricted food over the weekends			0
this is good news for dieters			0
it suggests that an occasional lapse wo n’t do any real harm .			0

limiting eating to an eight - hour window can help people shed weight
scientists in @entity38 said stopping eating after *4pm* and sticking to regular meal times helps the body burn calories
the regime could reverse obesity and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes
