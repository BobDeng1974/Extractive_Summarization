@entity1 , 43 , gave birth to healthy 4lb baby @entity3 in january by caesarian section after 35 weeks of pregnancy			1
doctors had told her the little girl was unlikely to survive because of her frail condition and the drugs she was taking to make sure the organs would be accepted			2
mrs @entity1 was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged seven and was given two kidney transplants , donated by her mother and brother , and a pancreas transplant , from a dead donor			1
she was told that the birth was an ' absolute miracle ' and health officials now believe that mrs @entity1 is the oldest person to give birth following a kidney and pancreas transplant			2
speaking to @entity28 , dr @entity29 , mrs @entity1 's consultant at the @entity31 & @entity32 , said : ' it is an absolute miracle that @entity1 managed to give birth to this little wonder , @entity3 , under the most adverse set of clinical circumstances			2
the odds were totally stacked against her			0
' there can not be many , if any , patients in the world who suffer from diabetic end stage kidney disease , who have a 10 - year history of kidney failure treatment , who have been on dialysis and subsequently received three transplanted organs , and then managed to conceive successfully , never mind producing a healthy baby			2
' mrs @entity1 has two previous children who were also delivered by caesarian section , though before she had triple set of transplants			1

' since the birth mrs @entity1 's pancreas , the third she has been given , has failed and she has been told she must wait until a year after the birth before the old one can be taken out and a new one put in			1
