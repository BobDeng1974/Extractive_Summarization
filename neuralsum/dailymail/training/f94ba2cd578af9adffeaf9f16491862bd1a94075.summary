in @entity16 , shoppers can buy a @entity54 ( 162g ) for £ 1 or a pouch of the same chocolate buttons ( 72g ) , which provide less than half the amount of chocolate , for the same price			2
@entity19 recently ran a promotion where shoppers could purchase two £ 1.50 @entity6 eggs and get two free , as well as two free @entity62 – but that offer appears to have been pulled after demand soared			1

@entity91 and @entity108 , the @entity106 - owned discount stores which usually specialise in stocking their own - brands , have also increased competition between the supermarket giants by selling branded eggs			1
for example , at @entity91 , a 149g @entity113 egg is being sold for just 99p			2

a spokesman said : ' you wo n't go in on @entity134 and find only one egg on the shelves			0
there will be plenty of eggs			0
' it 's possible we have run out of some of the ranges , in some of the sizes			0
quite obviously we are close to @entity6 and that tends to happen			0
' @entity16 has already stopped selling any @entity6 eggs on its website , saying it was prioritising customers who had already placed orders			1
sell - out : last year the supermarket industry was forced to apologise to customers after many were left searching for chocolate eggs on the saturday before @entity6 a spokesman said : ' to ensure no family goes without their eggs , we have put a hold on the ordering of some products online so we can focus on fulfilling our current orders before the weekend			1
' @entity162 , analyst at @entity163 , said it was ‘ a bit self - defeating ’ that @entity6 eggs have been so heavily - discounted in some supermarkets			1
he told @entity168 : ‘ basic economics would suggest that when demand is at its highest you could chose to price your products as you wish			0
' but supermarkets use easter eggs discounts as something they can talk about in tv adverts , and as a way of driving traffic			2
it 's because retailers and suppliers are over-obsessed with market share			0
