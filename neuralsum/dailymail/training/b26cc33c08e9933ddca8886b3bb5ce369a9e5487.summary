native americans are descended from @entity3 man and may have originally travelled from @entity4 by way of a land bridge that disappeared long ago , it has been revealed			1
the dna of a baby boy who was buried in @entity9 12,600 years ago has given scientists new insights into the ancient roots of today 's @entity1 and other native peoples of the @entity14			1
it is the oldest genome ever recovered from the @entity16 , and artifacts found with the body show the boy was part of the @entity3 culture , which existed in @entity22 from about 13,000 years ago to about 12,600 years ago and is named for an archaeological site near @entity3 , @entity24 a nearly - complete projectile point , top , a mid-stage point made of translucent quartz and an end - beveled rod of bone from a @entity3 - era burial site found in 1968 in western @entity9			1
scientists have recovered and analyzed the dna of an infant who died more than 12,000 years ago and was buried at the site where these artifacts were found , and have linked him to modern day @entity1			1
@entity3 man lived in @entity22 about 13,000 years ago where they hunted mammoth , mastodons and giant bison with big spears			1
the @entity3 people were not the first humans in @entity22 , but they represent the first humans with a wide expansion on the @entity22 continent – until the culture mysteriously disappeared only a few hundred years after its origin			1
centuries of cold , nicknamed the ' @entity50 , ' are believed to have wiped out the @entity3 , as well as most of the large mammals in @entity22 the boy 's genome showed his people were direct ancestors of many of today 's native peoples in the @entity14 , researchers said			1
the so - called @entity59 skeleton was found with about 125 artifacts , including @entity3 fluted spear points and tools made from antlers , and covered in red ochre , a type of mineral			2
' it is almost like finding the ' missing link ' to the common ancestor of the @entity1 , ' said @entity70 of the @entity71 in @entity72 , who led the study			2
the @entity3 boy 's family is the direct ancestor to roughly estimated 80 % of all present day @entity1			1
' although the @entity3 culture disappeared its people are living today			1
' put simply it is a sensation that we succeeded in finding an approximately 12,600 year old boy whose closest relatives can be regarded as the direct ancestor to so many people			2
' ' this also means that @entity3 did not descend from @entity86 , @entity4 or @entity87 , a theory that a number of scientists have advocated			2
' they were @entity1 – and the @entity93 ancestors were the first people in @entity22			1
this is now a fact			0
' the boy was more closely related to those in @entity97 than to those in @entity99			2
the reason for that difference is n't clear , scientists said			0
the researchers said they had no @entity93 dna from the @entity105 available for comparison , but that they assume the results would be same , with some @entity1 being direct descendants and others also closely related			1
the dna also indicates the boy 's ancestors came from @entity4 , supporting the standard idea of ancient migration to the @entity14 by way of a land bridge that disappeared long ago			2
the burial site , northeast of @entity118 , @entity9 , is the only burial known from the @entity3 culture			1
the boy was between 1 year and 18 months old when he died of an unknown cause			0
he was buried with 125 artifacts , including spear points and elk antler tools			0
some were evidently ritual objects or heirlooms			0
the burial site , marked by a pole at center left , where the remains of a boy from the only known burial site of the @entity3 culture was found in western @entity9			1
the artifacts and the skeleton were covered with powdered red ochre , a natural pigment , indicating a burial ceremony			0
the skeleton was discovered in 1968 next to a rock cliff , but it is only in recent years that scientists have been able to recover and analyze complete genomes from such ancient samples			0
the first humans came from @entity147 via the so - called @entity148 , which during the latest ice age connected @entity147 with @entity22 and did not bring the @entity3 culture with them			1
the @entity3 culture arose after they arrived in @entity22 and the boy from @entity59 was more a descendant of the first immigrants			1
the team found that @entity93 ancestors coming in from @entity147 split into two groups			0
one group is ancestors to the @entity1 presently living in @entity99 and the other one – which is represented by the @entity3 boy – is the ancestor to virtually all @entity1 in @entity97 and @entity160			1
the dna analysis was reported online wednesday in the journal nature by scientists including @entity70 of the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity164 of @entity165 and @entity166 of @entity167 in @entity168			0
the burial site lies on the property of the parents of another author , @entity59 of @entity118			0
it is known as the @entity59 site			0
the end of a beveled rod of bone and an incompleted projectile point from the @entity3 - era burial site @entity166 , a member of the @entity181 tribe , said the indication of such ancient roots for @entity1 fits with what many tribal people already believed			1
he also said the boy 's remains may be reburied at the site by late spring or early summer			0
' this discovery by @entity70 and his team proves something that tribal people have never doubted - we 've been here since time immemorial and all the ancient artifacts located within our homelands are remnants from our direct ancestors			0
' but the discovery is only part of the importance of this study			0
' the other part being @entity70 and his team 's respectful commitment to interacting face to face with tribal communities and listening to @entity93 leaders , which has lead directly to the reburial of this little boy			0
' in a telephone conference with reporters , the researchers said that once they discovered the link between the boy and today 's @entity1 , they sought out @entity1 groups to discuss the results			2
now an international team headed by @entity72 researcher @entity70 has mapped his genome thereby reviving the scientific debate about the colonization of the @entity14			0
roughly estimated some 80 % of all present - day @entity93 populations on the two @entity22 continents are direct descendants of the @entity3 boy 's family			1
the remaining 20 % are more closely related with the @entity3 family than any other people on @entity231 , says @entity232 professor @entity70 from the @entity233 at the @entity234 of @entity72 , @entity71			2
a nearly - complete projectile point , top , two mid-stage points and an " end - beveled " rod of bone from the @entity3 - era burial site found in 1968 in western @entity9			2
@entity70 , an expert in deciphering ancient dna , called for scientists to work closely with native peoples on such research			0
' then who were the first immigrants ? ' we do n't know			0
' maybe a @entity93 , maybe an ancestor related to the @entity249 boy from @entity147 and another one who was @entity251			0
' we do n't know			0
but our results eliminate all other theories about the origins of the first people in @entity22			2
' the first people in @entity22 were the direct ancestors of @entity1 , " says professor @entity70 the results are ' going to raise a whole host of new ideas and hypotheses ' about the early colonization of the @entity14 , said @entity262 , an ancient @entity263 expert at the @entity264 who was n't involved in the work .			1

@entity3 culture existed in @entity22 from about 13,000 years ago to about 12,600 years ago
find is the oldest genome ever recovered from the @entity16
proves modern @entity1 are related to the first humans to arrive
