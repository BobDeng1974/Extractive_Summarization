by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 5 february 2013 experts probing the fire on a @entity3 which has grounded the whole fleet today released fresh images of the charred battery at the centre of the investigation			1
pictures show the blackened remains of the lithium device as well as a frayed and broken earth wire , designed to reduce the risk of electric shock , which was attached to it at the time it ignited			2
investigators also confirmed that they had linked the in - flight fire which forced the @entity20 service to make an emergency landing in @entity22 last month to a similar incident in @entity24			1
overheated : the charred battery from the @entity3 plane which made an emergency landing on january 16 in @entity28 , is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of @entity31 in @entity32 , western @entity22 link : investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery to that suffered by a battery on another @entity3 which was also forced to make an emergency landing in @entity24 last month damage : a ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred , frayed and broken the @entity42 released the images as it continues to look at the reason why an @entity20 flight was forced to land on january 16			1
@entity47 scans of the overheated lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week earlier on january 7 which saw another @entity3 make an emergency landing in @entity24			1
all 50 @entity3 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue			1
the latest probe is said to have found evidence of short - circuiting and ' thermal runaway ' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating			0
the @entity20 flight made an emergency landing in western @entity22 after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin			1
an investigator in @entity22 at the time said the burned insides of the plane 's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits			2
experts from the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) had already disassembled the device believed to have caused the earlier @entity24 fault in a bid to discover the cause of the malfunction - but admitted late last month that they were no closer to reaching a conclusion			1
gutted : the extent of the damage to the @entity3 's battery , left , is best illustrated when it is placed next to an undamaged model , right charred : a cat scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery 's eight cells were all but destroyed but a week ago , @entity96 , the founder of @entity97 said the batteries used by @entity3 in its @entity3 aircraft are ' inherently unsafe ' - after it emerged that an airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded			1
all @entity20 ( @entity20 ) said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed other problems			1
and @entity109 also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 ' on a few occasions '			0
lithium ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat and are more likely to short - circuit than other types of batteries			0
boeing built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical systems on the 787 , the world 's first airliner made mostly from lightweight composite materials			0
investigation : the singed battery case from the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) @entity3 which caught fire in @entity24 is displayed inside an investigation lab at the @entity129 in @entity130 probe : the state - of - the - art @entity3 continues to be grounded as the investigation into the cause of the thermal damage continues burnt : the @entity79 's @entity135 , holds part of the badly fire - damaged battery casing from the plane involved in the @entity24 incident			1
the battery has been taken apart by experts in a bid to work out what went wrong investigators earlier said they found no evidence of quality problems with production of the 787 's batteries by @entity32 , @entity22 - based , @entity31 , whose own aerospace ambitions are on the line			1
but the issue may have hit the company 's business hard judging by its latest figures			0
@entity31 said tuesday that its april - december net profit fell 3.6 percent to 5.5 billion yuan ( $ 59.6 million ) from a year earlier , as demand for batteries lagged due to sluggish demand in @entity22 and overseas			0
the company has struggled to turn its lithium ion business to profitability			0
in april - december its lithium ion business posted a 7.2 billion yen ( $ 78.2 million ) loss , it said , compared with an operating loss of 3.26 billion yen in the full - year that ended march 31 , 2012			0
although @entity3 aircraft are currently grounded because of unsafe batteries , it emerged last week that restrictions against carrying the batteries as cargo were lifted			1
pilots and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the batteries on board at all if the plane 's battery system makes it too unsafe to fly			0
the new regulations were brought into effect on january 7 - the same day as one of the batteries caught fire on a @entity109 787 flight			2
the aircraft had landed 40 minutes earlier at @entity187 and almost 200 passengers and crew had disembarked when a cleaning team smelled smoke and alerted fire crews			0
the @entity3 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			2
they charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
the battery fire is just one of a series of problems - including two fuel leaks , a wiring problem , brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window â€“ to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late			2
@entity209 , chief engineer on the 787 , said last month that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			0
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk '			0
incident : a 787 made a landing in @entity28 after a burning smell was also detected in its cockpit			2
both all @entity222 and @entity109 have grounded their entire @entity3 fleets complex : parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world out of service : one of @entity230 six 787s sits on the tarmac at @entity232 in @entity233			2

pictures of burnt out battery from @entity20 787 revealed
the @entity3 was forced to make an emergency landing on january 16
investigators have taken device apart to figure out what went wrong
they have linked emergency landing to similar incident in @entity24
the planes remain grounded worldwide as investigation continues
