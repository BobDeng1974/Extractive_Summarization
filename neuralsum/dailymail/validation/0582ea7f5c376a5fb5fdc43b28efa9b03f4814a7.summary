there also are inadequate protections to prevent entry into air traffic computer systems from other , less - secure computer systems not directly involved in traffic operations , the report said			1
other problems identified in the report include : - security weaknesses identified by the @entity7 were n't always addressed in a timely way			2
- security control assessments by the agency were n't always comprehensive enough to find weaknesses			0
