by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 defender @entity2 and his teammates will be filled with ' rage ' when they take on @entity6 in their @entity8 quarter - final			1
not because they have anything personal against the @entity11 , but because they are still feeling the anger and desperation after barely qualifying for the tournament in @entity16			0
@entity2 has been @entity3 's vice captain since the second leg of the @entity8 playoffs against @entity19			1
with the team trailing 2 - 0 after a dire performance in @entity22 , @entity2 scored in a 3 - 0 win , and his passionate performance sparked a remarkable turnaround			1
goal to goal : @entity29 players are put through their paces during a training session at the @entity32 out of the blocks : @entity3 carry out some sprint drills on wednesday afternoon in @entity35 jog on : @entity3 face @entity6 in their quarter - final on friday night ready for action : @entity3 defender @entity2 speaks during wednesday 's press conference in @entity35 @entity41 : @entity3 since then , @entity3 is unbeaten in eight games and has kept six clean sheets			1
' of course i still have the rage inside me from that game , ' the @entity45 defender said wednesday			0
' we all have a little bit of that rage inside of us			0
' @entity3 is vastly more inexperienced than @entity6 , which has reached at least the semifinals of each major competition since the 2008 @entity53			1
by contrast , @entity3 is rebuilding and has not reached any semifinal since the 2006 @entity8			1
but several fresh talents have revamped the national team - which only has two regular starters older than 29			1
' we 're a very young team with new players , ' @entity2 said			2
' we 've instilled a new spirit into the team - off the pitch , first of all - and it reflects on the pitch			1
' we know that @entity6 is a big team , a big football nation , ' @entity2 added			1
' but we 're also very good and i believe in us			0
' at 24 years old , @entity2 is the oldest of @entity3 's new generation and has played 22 times for his country			1
he was rested against @entity72 after failing to shake of a left hamstring injury but is fit again to face @entity6 on friday at @entity74			2
besides @entity2 , @entity75 has established himself in midfield and @entity77 has done likewise in central defense			2
meanwhile , @entity79 has confidently replaced winger @entity80 , who was injured before the tournament			0
hot shot : @entity75 has been one of the standout players in this year 's @entity8 huddle : @entity3 's @entity86 , @entity2 , @entity75 and @entity87 chat during training back of the net : @entity3 are bidding to win the @entity8 for the first time since 1998 the 33 - year - old @entity91 and 31 - year - old @entity92 are the senior players			1
but unlike before , all the players mingle and there is no generational conflict within the squad			0
' everyone sits together at the dinner table , there 's no difference , ' @entity2 said			2
' after the meal last night eight of us stayed at the table to talk about football and about life in general			0
' some change from @entity110 , when players formed cliques and went straight to their rooms after finishing their meals			0
it was even worse at the @entity116 , where they were united - but only because they went on strike and refused to train after one of their teammates was sent home			0
' i was n't part of the old generation , but we really sense that this team gets on , ' @entity2 said			2
' if you have strong characters things can blow apart when you 're together for one month			0
we have strong characters in this team but we 're able to control it			0
' @entity75 scored his first goal of the tournament in monday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity72 in the second round , and he 's also been making an impression behind the scenes			2
' @entity75 really gets the atmosphere going			0
last night he stuck some music on and he was dancing all on his own , ' @entity2 said			2
' everyone was watching him and it was really funny			0
' run through : @entity144 will be underdogs when they face @entity6 heart to heart : @entity3 coach @entity147 ( left ) speaks with @entity3 's forward @entity148 here they come : @entity3 assistant @entity150 ( left ) and forward @entity151 emerge from the dugouts			1
