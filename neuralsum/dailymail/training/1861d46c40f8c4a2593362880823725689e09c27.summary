by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's the household staple for healthy bones and pearly white teeth			0
but for one woman , a love of @entity7 whole milk has turned into an uncontrollable addiction which sees her drink ten pints of the white stuff every day			2
@entity11 from @entity12 , @entity13 , depends on the drink so much , she wo n't allow her family to touch her full - fat supply			1
mrs @entity11 , who lives with her husband , son and foster child , did n't drink milk as a child but now ca n't make it through the day without her fix			1
' during the day i have at least two or three , i usually top six pints between 9am and 10pm , ' she said			0
' but i really crave and want milk after 10pm at night , i do n’t know if it is something psychological			2
' it does n’t matter if i ’m drinking a glass of wine , but if my husband asks me if i want another glass i ’ll say ‘ no i want a glass of milk ’			2
' i could even be drinking champagne or be out in a restaurant and if people ask me i ’ll say " you know what , can i have a glass of milk ? " ' i did drink milk when i was younger and when i was a kid and my brother is a big milk drinker			0
' he likes milk but not like me - he does n’t have to have it every single day , seven days a week			1
' on a typical day , mrs @entity11 will drink milk in her coffee when she wakes up and then a pint or two with lunch			1
she drinks another pint with dinner , but can get through an entire six - litre bottle while watching television between 9pm and 11.30pm			1
sometimes she 'll opt for two strawberry milkshakes with double cream instead			0
between 11.30pm and 2am , the foster carer can drink a four - litre bottle			1
she added she sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night and walks to a 24hour shop to stock up on milk if she 's run out when the craving strikes her			0
while working at a primary school , mrs @entity11 even urged children to swap their milk for fruit juice so she would have more , she said			1
in a designated fridge at her family home , she keeps her supply of blue - topped full fat milk			1
the 46 - year - old said her favourite way of drinking milk was if it is ice - cold and in a wine glass the foster carer buys herself whole milk and stocks up on semi-skimmed for her husband , son and foster child and while her children have a habit of ducking into her supply , her husband @entity94 is less fond of it			1
' @entity94 actually has a small phobia of milk , it ’s @entity103 ’s honest truth he actually ca n’t stand the stuff , he ’ll have a bit in coffee but other than that if you offered him a £ 100 to drink a glass - he would n’t			1
' ' if i want a kiss i have to wipe my mouth of the milk or he wo n’t kiss me			1
but i think it ’s nothing bad , it ’s not like i ’m on drugs or alcohol			0
' ' the problem is i put on weight with it , if i did n’t drink milk i ’d be a size 10 , but i ’m pushing a 12 or size 14 now			2
' i would love get hypnotised , but it ’s the money , if someone offered to do that i would take it			0
' it ’s got so bad i do n’t even like the taste of water and i think that ’s because of all the milk i drink			0
' i get narky if i go to the fridge and someone has drunk the blue milk , i ask " who ’s done that ? ’ i tell them " you do n’t use the blue stuff , you use the green " '			2
' i buy the big six - litre bottles , then i have to buy a four - pint of semi-skimmed milk for the family , i do n’t drink that but i ’ve got it there if i am desperate			1
' the milk bill easily is topping £ 25 a week , and then the cream i buy is on top of that , but i ’ve tried to cut down on cream			0
' as far as my health is concerned i must have great bones			0
' for centuries doctors have encouraged milk as a source of calcium which strengthens the bones and teeth			0
children were administered the drink at schools across the country and overseas			0
if so good for our bones and bodies , can there ever be such a thing as drinking too much milk ? according to the @entity168 , whole standardised milk has a fat content of 3.5 % compared with 1.7 % in semi-skimmed , and 0.1 % in skimmed			2
' relatively small quantities of milk can provide a significant proportion of daily nutrient requirements for all age groups making it nutrient rich relative to its energy content , ' the @entity168 's website states			0
but with an estimated 149 calories in a single glass of full - fat milk , drinking large amounts of the substance can lead to weight gain or digestion problems			1
@entity187 and @entity168 guidelines state : ' much of the fat in milk and dairy foods is saturated fat			2
' for older children and adults , eating too much saturated fat can contribute to becoming overweight			0
' it can also cause raised levels of cholesterol in the blood , and this can put you at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke			0
' if you 're trying to cut down on fat it 's a good idea to go for lower - fat milks			1
' semi-skimmed , 1 % fat and skimmed milks contain all the important nutritional benefits of milk , but are lower in fat			2

@entity11 wo n't let her family touch her supply of full - fat milk
the 46 - year - old keeps six - litre bottles in their own fridge at home
shuns alcohol for ice - cold glasses of milk on nights out with friends
mrs @entity11 says she would like to be hypnotised as she is gaining weight
