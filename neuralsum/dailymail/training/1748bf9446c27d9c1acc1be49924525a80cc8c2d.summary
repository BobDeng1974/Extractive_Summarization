by @entity0 the average @entity2 man is four inches taller than 100 years ago			2
@entity4 credit improvements in nutrition , hygiene and housing and the decline of heavy industry for allowing modern males to tower over their great - grandfathers			1
smaller family sizes have also played an important role			1
but surprisingly , advances in medicine are not thought to have been key			1
upwardly mobile : the average @entity2 man is four inches taller than 100 years ago the research , by economic historian @entity16 , found that the typical young man in @entity2 today is 5ft 10in			2
this compares with just 5ft 6in a century ago			2
professor @entity16 , of the @entity20 , used @entity22 records to obtain the adult height of soldiers born in the 1890s			2
recruitment pressures meant that the official minimum height of 5ft 3in was often disregarded and it is believed the data is fairly representative of the generation as a whole			0
information about on the men ’s childhood taken from the 1901 census helped explain why modern man is four inches taller , on average			0
it is thought that nutrition and hygiene , improvements in water supply and sewage disposal , changes in housing , including the clearing of slums and the reduction in overcrowding all played a role			1
fascinatingly , family size mattered , with recruits shorter the more siblings they had			1
for example , men with six brothers and sisters were half an inch shorter than those with just one			0
it is thought that children in large , overcrowded households suffered from lack of food and exposure to infection			1
data : researchers used @entity22 records to obtain the adult height of soldiers born in the 1890s in contrast , coming from a family with a high socio - economic status added about half an inch to height			1
but home - life was not the most important factor			2
the study , presented at the @entity80 ’s annual conference found the conditions in the neighbourhood the men grew up in , including child death rates , to have the biggest impact on height			0
the two key ingredients of growth during childhood are nutrition , which builds bone and tissue , and disease , which hinders it			1
high infant death rates are seen as a sign of disease being rife , overcrowding and toxic heavy industry			0
bearing this out , the professor found that the men who grew up in the least healthy districts were an inch shorter than those from the healthiest areas			0
a childhood in an area with high rates of illiteracy among young women stunted growth – perhaps because as mothers , they had less access to information about nutrition and hygiene			1
it is thought that nutrition and hygiene , improvements in water supply and sewage disposal , changes in housing , including the clearing of slums and the reduction in overcrowding all played a role while advances in medicine are usually assumed to go hand - in - hand with improved living standards , professor @entity16 does n’t think they are hugely important in this case			1
this is because most of the improvements , including routine use of antibiotics , did n’t occur until the second half of the century – long after the growth spurt begun			2
professor @entity16 believes that female height likely increased in parallel			0
however , lack of historical data , such as the @entity146 records used for the men , makes it difficult to put figures on women ’s growth over time			0
his data is for @entity2 as a whole but previous research has shown the @entity155 to be the shortest people in the @entity2			0
yet , 200 years ago , they towered over their @entity159 cousins			0
the @entity161 researchers said it seems that the pace of improvement in living standards in @entity159 , and particularly the @entity166 , outstripped the change in @entity155 .			0
