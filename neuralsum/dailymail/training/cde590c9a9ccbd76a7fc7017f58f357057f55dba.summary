concern : @entity3 has warned players could get injured due to lack of preparation ‘ i think this year , the final of the @entity35 was on july 13 , the start of the league is august 16 , if you want to give some holiday to the players your preparation becomes very short			1
‘ i think we could have done with one week later for all the competitions , the @entity26 and the @entity13			1
‘ if you do n’t give players enough holiday or enough build - up in their preparation and play them straight away then they get injured			0
