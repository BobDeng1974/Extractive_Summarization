last year , for my 54th birthday , i acquired an invisibility cloak			1
it was n’t on my wishlist , it did n’t come wrapped in a parcel , and no one bought it for me			1
to be honest , i did n’t even know i had it , until a conversation in the office with two of my young , male colleagues			1
perched on my desk , cheerfully immune to my ‘ go away ’ eyes , my colleagues reeled off the results of an informal poll they had conducted on the relative foxiness of my young female staff			1
many women bemoan the feeling of becoming invisible as they hit middle age as i shooed them away , it dawned on me : as far as these pups were concerned , i was so far over the hill and down the other side that i may as well have been one of the boys			1
they felt able to talk freely about my much younger colleagues because i was no longer in the running for their poll — and , even more insultingly , i was presumed too old to care			1
somewhere along the line , i had become invisible			1
the downsides of being a woman in her mid- 50s have been chewed over			1
as well as a survey this year stating that more than two - thirds of the over- 50s feel completely ignored by men , this week journalist and tv presenter @entity38 weighed in			1
as well as a survey this year stating that more than two - thirds of the over- 50s feel completely ignored by men , this week journalist and tv presenter @entity38 weighed in still attractive and obviously intelligent , at 52 , @entity38 claims to have been made effectively invisible as soon as she hit her half - century			1
‘ i shed half my workload the moment 50 appeared on my cv , ’ she said			1
and surprise , surprise , it was her tv show that went , not the radio work			1
even beautiful actress @entity55 admits she feels ‘ invisible ’ while surrounded by younger starlets at the @entity57			1
‘ when you ’re walking down the street , you get bumped into , people slam doors in your face — they just do n’t notice you , ’ she says			1
‘ somehow , you just vanish			2
’ work - related problems are serious			2
but , for many of us , it boils down to one main complaint : people — specifically men — just do n’t seem to notice us anymore			2
eyes do n’t flicker lustfully in our direction when we enter a room			2
no one bundles over to ask to join us in the pub. yes , we know we ’re being inconsistent here			2
we ’re the ones who spent our 20s and 30s railing against catcalls in the street and cheesy chat - up lines in bars			2
so , why do we now miss the thing we once detested ? actress @entity85 , now 68 and in a relationship with a man 30 years her junior , says : ‘ i would n’t want to be 20			1
i know so much more and i ’m much more comfortable in my skin ' well , because no one likes to feel invisible			1
my 55 - year - old friend @entity91 , a drop - dead gorgeous solicitor , who has prised more stray fingers away in her time than @entity95 ’s @entity94 , recently bumped into a man she ’d previously sat next to during a day - long conference			2
‘ after five minutes , it became obvious he barely remembered me — he had me confused with some dumpy lawyer in her late - 60s ! ’ she says			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , it ’s those who ’ve spent 30 years toiling at the maternal coalface who feel the most anonymous			2
‘ we ’re so used to defining ourselves in terms of who we are to other people that we ’ve lost track of what we are to ourselves , ’ says my friend @entity106			2
‘ being inward - facing is partly what makes women become invisible			1
for me , it was caused by being overly focused on the children			2
’ another friend , who is also a mum , says : ‘ sometimes , i think i just blend in with the scenery			2
i ’m not certain i am even composed of solid matter when i ’m outside of the family home			2
’ but are we missing some of the upsides ? personally , i think it ’s time our generation of women started to get a grip			1
as we age , we acquire wisdom and knowledge			1
some of us have children and some get increased status at work			2
is all this really such a terrible trade - off for sagging skin and anonymity ? really , i find it liberating that , now , i find myself caring less what others think of me			0
@entity141 said her 50s came with increased self - knowledge one friend of mine , who we ’d better just call ms @entity147 , airily suggested this could be the ideal time to set up an international crime syndicate			1
‘ who would ever notice or mistrust us ? ’ she joked			0
‘ and , just think , @entity153 would never catch us — because the crime scenes would be so lovely and clean ! ’ just call us @entity155			0
indeed , this cloak confers on us a new identity			0
it allows us to be perceived as human beings first and women second — like we ’ve always wanted			1
‘ at 50 , what i am on the outside is [ now ] less of a distraction from who i am on the inside , ’ says my friend @entity161			0
‘ women feel less competitive around me and men talk to me as an equal			1
as i ’ve got older , it ’s become easier to deal with tradesmen — it ’s as if they do n’t have to impress me with their manliness any more			0
’ similarly , all invisibles are equal			0
all of a sudden , the gap between me and my most irritatingly beautiful friend becomes far less of a chasm than it was in my 20s			0
indeed , even the gap between me and @entity55 is less of a chasm			0
i ’ve found myself feeling warmer towards both of them as a result			0
and i ’ve been able to reinvent myself			0
the last time i pulled this off was when i left home for university and found myself among a group of strangers			0
‘ you ’re so confident ! ’ one hot fresher told me , blithely unaware that , for the past few years , i ’d been seen as the classroom geek and disco wallflower			0
invisibility means nobody will notice , object or mock if i suddenly decide i want a change of direction			0
indeed , government figures show that , in the past year , more than 34,000 people over 50 have started an apprenticeship with a view to a new career			0
on a more frivolous level , it ’s the perfect time to try out a new hairstyle , look , or hobby			0
earlier this year , we were told women in their 50s were driving a boom in sales of soft - top cars			1
and even if the new hairstyle goes wrong , one brilliant plus to being invisible is that we no longer need to dress to pull			1
when she hit 50 , @entity216 said she had ‘ never felt more confident in myself , more clear on who i am as a woman ’ ‘ it ’s such a relief not always having to make an effort to look your best for the opposite sex , ’ says journalist @entity220			1
‘ last week , i went away for a girls ’ weekend			0
in the evening , we all scrubbed up well , but without any of the angst 20 - year - olds have			0
we just wanted to have a lovely time together — not get a date			0
’ yet at this point in our lives , we also know exactly how to look our best — so we can still whip off that cloak if we choose to			0
‘ i love being able to pop out for milk first thing — no make up , hair all over the place — knowing nobody will cast a look in my direction , ’ says @entity220			0
‘ but if i do make an effort to glam - up , those same indifferent blokes will often do the second - glance thing and smile at me			0
’ when she hit 50 , @entity216 said she had ‘ never felt more confident in myself , more clear on who i am as a woman ’			1
actress @entity85 , now 68 and in a relationship with a man 30 years her junior , says : ‘ i would n’t want to be 20			1
i know so much more and i ’m much more comfortable in my skin			0
’ and let ’s hear it for the ultimate cougar , @entity253 ’s @entity141 : ‘ in my 50s [ came ] this wonderful self - knowledge			1
you ’re not trying to be somebody else , or do something else with your life			0
you think : “ here i am			0
i ’ve gone through this , i ’ve survived that , and i know who i am now ”			0
’ could it be that , in our 50s , we have more choices ? and are we more likely to be content at 55 than at any other point in our lives ? let ’s all meet up for a drink to discuss it			0
and if we ’re ignored by the barman ? who cares .			0
