by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 23:00 est , 2 november 2013 nestled among the emerald hills of the @entity3 , the @entity1 sits in an idyllic spot at the centre of a postcard - perfect village			1
@entity7 , near @entity8 , is inside the @entity9 , favourite destination of hikers and mountain - bikers			2
its village green , babbling brook , cosy pub and stone cottages make it a place people tend not to want to leave			2
in fact , the @entity1 had been in the same hands for nearly 90 years when the current owners bought it in 2005			1
it was run by the @entity24 family from 1918 until 1984 , when the last miss @entity25 retired from the role of postmistress			2
the old post office at @entity7 , @entity3 , home of @entity29 and @entity30 and their 4 children the counter used to be in the room now transformed into a farmhouse - style kitchen / diner , complete with cream @entity37 , tiled floor and a bowl of eggs laid by the children 's chickens			2
' my husband used to come in here as a child to buy stamps , ' says owner @entity30			2
the 17th century , @entity50 listed house has many untouched period features , including a complete cast - iron range in the sitting room with its ovens still intact			1
this is where @entity30 warms her mince pies and mulled wine at @entity59 , and dries the kindling for the open fire			2
on the other side of the hallway is a second , smaller sitting room with a log - burner , which the family use as a snug but could become a dining room , playroom or spacious study			0
the ground floor is completed by a large utility room with tiled flooring and a butler 's sink , along with a cloakroom and separate boot room			0
upstairs , the bedrooms are as charming and distinctive as the rooms below			0
old wooden doors lead into four bedrooms with original fireplaces and window recesses deep enough to sit in			0
there 's also a bathroom and a shower room on this floor , while the pitched and beamed attic has been turned into a fifth bedroom with an en suite bathroom , currently given over to the @entity92 ' nanny			0
the whole house has been beautifully refurbished and tastefully decorated , mostly in light colours that allow the beams , sash windows and other architectural quirks to speak for themselves			1
' we bought the @entity99 from one of the postmistress 's nephews , ' says @entity103 ' we put in a new kitchen , including the @entity37 , and floor tiles from @entity106 , a local quarry			1
we completely did up the attic , which was previously used for storage , and put in new bathrooms			0
' the sitting room with cast iron range the @entity1 also generates an income , no longer from sending off parcels but from the holiday cottage that @entity30 , 40 , and husband @entity29 , 41 , created a few years ago out of an old stone stable behind the main house			1
winning a four - star @entity119 from the @entity121 , it 's as characterful as the house , with a brick horse trough and an owl hole above the door , originally to let owls ( good mouse - hunters ) in and @entity129 pretty cottage has a double bedroom and bathroom on the ground floor , with a sitting room and kitchen on the first			1
it also has its own sun - trap patio and is often booked by couples as a romantic getaway ( @entity140 , sykes cottages.co.uk )			0
' we let it all through the year ; people come for long weekends even in the low season , ' says @entity30 - @entity147 the @entity92 have also converted a former pigsty in the garden into an office , though it has been unused since former @entity151 captain @entity29 took over the family business , @entity154 department store , which has outlets in @entity8 and @entity156			0
with a mini-kitchen and log - burner , it must be one of the cosiest pigsties in @entity3			0
the spacious kitchen the garden is unusually large for a village house and slopes gently upwards from the stone steps that connect it to the flagstone courtyard			1
@entity30 says that when they first bought the house , you could hardly get through to the garden for all the brambles , but it is now a haven for the games of the @entity92 ' four children : @entity177 , seven , who keeps the chickens ; @entity179 , five ; and two - year - old twins @entity180 and @entity182			1
there 's a hammock slung between two trees , an outdoor pizza oven built by @entity29 , stone seats in the walls and plenty of trees to climb , some of which are laden with apples , pears and damsons			0
at the top of the one - and - a - half - acre garden is a section that was once a paddock and could easily be one again , with another stable in its far corner			0
surrounded by trees , the garden is secluded and faces south , catching the sun all day			0
' in the summer we get sunshine at the top of the garden until 8pm , ' says @entity30 , standing at a point in the garden that has a lovely view down towards the house			1
' i will miss this spot			0
you feel that you are both in the village and outside it because it 's so private			0
' after eight years , the @entity92 have found another house , with larger rooms than the @entity1 , that they would like to live in , and have put their home on the market for Â£ 850,000			1
they have no intention , however , of going very far , as the new house is in the same village			1
like other residents , such as the @entity24 family who lived at the @entity1 for the best part of a century , they have no plans to leave @entity7			1

@entity232 bought 17th century , @entity50 listed house , in 2005
@entity1 was in same hands for nearly 90 years when they took over
