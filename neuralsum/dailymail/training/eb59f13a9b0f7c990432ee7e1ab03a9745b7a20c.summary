by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 19:45 est , 9 june 2012 one of the hostages rescued in a daring raid on a remote @entity4 cave has spoken for the first time of the dramatic @entity7 rescue mission and their perilous dash to safety			1
aid worker @entity10 and her @entity12 colleague @entity11 were thought to be hours away from execution when @entity14 ordered @entity15 to make the 1am swoop on their captors ’ hideout			1
now miss @entity10 has told of the ‘ terrible ’ firefight that left five of the kidnappers dead – and of how the fearless troops helped them scramble barefoot for miles over rocks and mountains in pitch darkness until they could be airlifted out of harm ’s way			1
@entity26 , from @entity27 , and @entity28 , from @entity29 , were on a mercy mission to bring health - care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities the 26 - year - old described how the stillness of the night in the so - called ‘ @entity38 ’ in the isolated province of @entity40 , in north - eastern @entity4 , was shattered by the surgical rescue operation she said : ‘ i did n’t even know what sounds i was hearing when the soldiers came			1
i was in a deep sleep and i ’d never heard a gunshot or a bomb explosion in my life			2
i know now that the @entity12 troops were killing the kidnappers , a terrible sound			1
‘ @entity11 and i were groggy from sleep , but we were pulled out of the cave and found ourselves being rushed towards safety			1
’ but the flight out of the steep - sided valley to the waiting helicopter was not easy			1
‘ we had no shoes on so the soldiers had to carry us in their arms , ’ miss @entity10 said			1
‘ it was a pitch - black night and very cold			2
we climbed up stony mountainsides and down through valleys			2
‘ the soldiers had already done the difficult journey to come and find us , and there was a terrible shoot - out with the kidnap gang			2
‘ but they talked to us , comforted us and carried us , all the way back to the helicopter			1
we thank them and we thank @entity71 for saving our lives			2
’ last weekend ’s joint @entity12 and @entity74 - led operation came after the two women and their two @entity4 translators had spent 12 terrifying days in captivity , drinking water made from melted snow and living in constant fear for their lives			1
the heavily armed criminal gang , who demanded a £ 7 million ransom , had seized the group from the charity @entity88 on may 22 as they were crossing the mountains on horseback			2
@entity26 , from @entity27 , and @entity28 , from @entity29 their cameras , mobile phones , laptops and wallets were stolen and the group was taken at gunpoint to a cave			2
shortly afterwards they were moved to another			2
‘ we stayed in the second cave for about a week , ’ said miss @entity10			1
‘ there were no comforts but the kidnappers needed to keep us alive			0
‘ we were given adequate food and there was water from melted snow			0
@entity11 and i comforted each other and that helped us both			1
after that we were moved to a third cave , and that was where we were rescued			2
‘ i ’m still very shaken by what we went through			0
twelve days seemed like a lifetime and there was no knowing when or if it would ever end			0
’ after their escape , the two women were flown to the @entity4 capital @entity121 for medical checks and a military debriefing			0
@entity26 , from @entity27 , and @entity28 , from @entity29 , were on a mercy mission to bring health - care and medicine to mothers and babies in isolated communities			0
now safely back home with her family in @entity132 , near @entity133 , miss @entity10 declared : ‘ it ’s not just a job to me , it ’s a calling			1
i felt sure it was the right thing to do and i would probably do it again			0
but i need to spend time just getting back to normal now			0
i know my parents and my brothers went through a lot , not knowing if i would survive this			0
’ she said she had never ridden a horse before but agreed to tackle the eight - hour journey because of her desire to help mothers in a region where maternal death rates are among the highest in the world			0
special forces swooped in on the cave where @entity26 and miss @entity10 were being held captive in the isolated @entity40 province and carried them to a helicopter to be airlifted out miss @entity10 has been receiving counselling at her home , an imposing hilltop house where she lives with her two older brothers and her parents , @entity157 , a doctor , and his teaching consultant wife @entity159			1
she said she hoped to enjoy a reunion with 28 - year - old @entity26 – a nutrition expert who trained at the @entity162 and @entity163 – because their ordeal had brought them so close together			0
@entity26 , who has still to talk about her ordeal , was said by friends last night to be ‘ resting ’			0
miss @entity10 ’s father told @entity171 : ‘ it would be good for @entity10 to talk to @entity11			1
the two girls hardly knew each other before but the dreadful circumstances of their kidnap have brought them close			0
i think they need each other			0
’ dr @entity10 added that he was monitoring his daughter ’s health , saying : ‘ she seems physically fine but we are concerned			1
it ’s very early days and she often breaks down			0
’ he also said that the conditions in @entity4 had taken his daughter by surprise			0
‘ she has been to some remote , arid areas but i do n’t think she was prepared for the scale of that hard , barren landscape , ’ he added			0
after the operation , @entity14 praised the rescue team , which also included members of the @entity7 , @entity74 @entity194 and @entity195 , and @entity4 special forces called the @entity197 teams			1
he said : ‘ we will never be able to publish their names but the whole country should know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do amazingly brave things			0
