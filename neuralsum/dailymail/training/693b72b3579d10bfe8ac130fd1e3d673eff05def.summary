by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 6 august 2013 @entity3 staff and organisations that ‘ wilfully ’ or ‘ recklessly ’ harm patients should face new criminal penalties , a major review said yesterday			0
it also demanded legal sanctions against leaders in the @entity3 with a ‘ could n’t care less ’ attitude or who deliberately withhold information			2
the review headed by professor @entity14 , a world expert in patient safety , said there have been repeated safety defects in the @entity3 with too many patients and carers suffering as a result			1
facing both ways : health secretary @entity22 ruled out minimum staffing levels in the health service but admitted cutbacks can hit safety it called for a culture of transparency that puts patient safety above targets , especially financial goals			1
continually improving patient safety should ‘ permeate every action and level in the @entity3 ’ , said the review commissioned by the government in the wake of the public inquiry into the @entity38 scandal where hundreds of patients were routinely neglected and died			0
managers chasing financial targets were partly blamed			0
the @entity46 report set out measures including a review of staffing ratios to ensure that sufficient numbers are on duty at all times , and simplifying an over-complex regulatory system run by many different agencies			1
the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) should come up with a formula to help @entity3 leaders check that hospital wards are properly staffed , with research suggesting one registered nurse per eight patients , but locally implemented			2
however , prof @entity14 said changing the culture of the @entity3 would ‘ trump ’ any new rules and strategies , and he stressed that accidental errors by staff would not be subject to criminal prosecution under the new system			1
but organisations that mislead regulators or hide evidence would face criminal sanctions along with staff who wilfully mistreat or neglect patients causing serious harm or death			0
he said : ‘ where there is wilful or reckless neglect of patients there needs to be consequences			0
’ but it would affect ‘ a very small number of cases ’			0
guru : prof @entity14 was a key @entity86 aide and championed president @entity89 's @entity88 scheme prof @entity14 stopped short of saying a duty of candour should be enshrined in law requiring @entity3 staff to report beliefs about serious incidents , saying it was already included in professional codes of conduct			1
he also said it would be a ‘ bureaucratic nightmare ’ for staff to be obliged to follow an automatic duty of candour where patients are told about every error or near miss. prof @entity14 , a former adviser to president @entity89 , said most staff were trying to do their best			1
but his report said supervisory regimes and regulation in the @entity3 should avoid ‘ diffusion of responsibility ’ , adding : ‘ when so many are in charge , no one is			0
’ there should be a review of such organisations including the much - criticised @entity118 by 2017			0
harm : @entity120 asked @entity123 president @entity89 's former health adviser @entity14 to review how to change the culture of the @entity3 campaigners warned the review was another in a long line of ‘ navel gazing ’ reports into @entity3 shortcomings with few practical answers			1
but health secretary @entity22 said it was a ‘ call to action ’ for the @entity3 although he did not accept that a national staffing minimum was necessary			1
he said there was a danger that hospitals would settle for achieving the minimum even though there would be times when they would need to go beyond it			2
@entity142 , chief executive of the @entity143 , said the report was ‘ heavy on platitudes but light on practical solutions ’			0
@entity149 , of the group @entity150 , added : ‘ unless the government implements mandatory minimum nursing staff levels per ward and a duty for all staff to tell patients when their care goes wrong , staff will carry on as usual			2
’ shadow health secretary @entity158 said : ‘ all the experts are now telling the government to get a grip on staffing levels			1
over 800 nursing jobs were lost last month alone – now totalling almost 5,000 since the election			0
’ @entity165 , chief executive of the @entity166 , said : ‘ this important report puts safety first and , if implemented , will improve care and save lives			2
