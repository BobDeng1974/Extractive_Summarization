by @entity0 @entity1 was taken to hospital for precautionary checks after his jaw - dropping crash with pastor @entity5 in sunday 's @entity6			1
@entity5 was handed three penalties by the stewards after the stunning incident which saw @entity1 roll his @entity10			1
the @entity12 driver clumsily t - boned @entity1 as he exited the pits , subsequently flipping the @entity10 airborne			1
roll over : pastor @entity5 t - bones @entity1 thus launching the @entity10 airborne going over : the @entity10 driver was taken to hospital for precautionary checks but later released in trouble : the @entity19 was fortunate to walk away from the accident relatively unscathed the view from on - board : @entity1 is left a passenger as his @entity10 is sent airborne by @entity5 the crash led to the deployment of the safety car , with @entity1 fortunate to walk away relatively unscathed from the incident on lap 40			1
@entity5 was handed a ten second stop - and - go penalty during the race by the stewards , and a five - place grid penalty to be served at the @entity32 in a fortnight			1
as a further punishment , he was also given three penalty points on his licence			0
nine more and he 'll be hit with a one - race ban			2
' good news ! @entity1 has completed all medical checks and everything is fine			1
he has been released from the hospital , ' @entity10 later said			0
hats off to all at @entity44 for allowing @entity45 and @entity46 go toe - to - toe for the race win			1
it would have been much easier for the top brass at @entity44 to impose team orders on the duelling pair and thus denying us all of a brilliant spectacle			2
refreshingly @entity54 asked both drivers to bring both cars home – as opposed to requesting them to hold station – and his order was duly obliged			0
can @entity44 however , continue with this approach ? i see no reason why not			0
such is their advantage , they could collide at more than one race this season and still lead both championships			0
indeed , the @entity68 are already 67 points clear of their nearest challengers			0
whether such an occurrence would be good for team morale is , however , another debate			2
team game : @entity44 celebrated their second 1 - 2 finish in as many races - they lead the constructors ' championship pure theatre : @entity46 ( left ) and @entity45 duel for the lead of the @entity82 @entity6 three - time world champion @entity83 claimed sunday 's race was one of the greatest grands prix he 'd ever witnessed – high praise indeed from a man who has been involved in the sport for the best part of five decades			1
' if anybody complains that @entity92 is boring then they are an idiot , ' he added			0
and few would contest @entity83 's sentiments			0
aside from one of the greatest on - track battles for the win , there was also action right throughout the field			2
from the warring @entity103 duo of @entity104 and @entity105 , to a sublime inter-team battle between @entity109 drivers ' @entity107 and @entity110 , and @entity111 picking his way through the field after starting 13th , sunday 's race really did have it all			1
if this is @entity92 in crisis , then you 'll have no complaints from me			0
what drama : the @entity6 was one of the finest @entity92 races in recent times ' @entity111 is quicker than you			2
let him go by please '			0
the radio message relayed to @entity127 that none of us ever expected to hear			2
@entity111 was n't given a hope in heck of showing up his four - time world champion team - mate after he was unveiled as @entity134 's successor at @entity135			1
how wrong we all were			0
after blowing his @entity135 team - mate away in qualifying , @entity127 was then ordered to move out of @entity111 's way during sunday 's race			1
admittedly the two were on differing strategies at that point in the race			0
but in the closing stages of the grand prix , with @entity111 behind @entity127 , the @entity146 , brimming with confidence , laid down another marker on his team - mate when he executed a perfect move for fifth place			1
he then passed @entity110 before coming up just short of a podium finish			0
not bad after starting 13th			0
man on a mission : @entity111 finished fourth after starting sunday 's race in 13th following his grid penalty @entity158 marked his 250th grand prix with @entity160 ahead of sunday 's race as the team posed for a host of group photos sporting commemorative t - shirts			1
it 's a good job they celebrated @entity158 's impressive landmark before the race as they had little to fawn over in the aftermath			2
@entity172 became the first @entity160 driver to retire from a race since @entity45 crashed out at the @entity175 @entity6 in 2012 when he suffered a terminal gearbox issue			1
and the problem was somewhat contagious with @entity158 suffering a similar race - ending glitch			1
' i was running in fifth and it was going to be a interesting race , ' said @entity158			2
' the guys then said stop changing gears which was a little bit difficult			0
' at the restart it took a second to change at every gear shift			0
i thought we could get to the end but it failed and we had to retire			0
' @entity158 's 250th start came in @entity92 's 900th race meaning the @entity195 can boast appearing in 28 per cent of all world championship races .			1

@entity1 hospitalised after he is t - boned by @entity5
@entity5 *slapped* with five - place grid drop for @entity32
@entity45 and @entity46 involved in memorable battle for win
@entity127 is ordered to make way for team - mate @entity111
@entity158 retires with gearbox glitch on 250th grand prix appearance
