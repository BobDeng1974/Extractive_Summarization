in a stunning admission tuesday afternoon , a senior @entity1 official told reporters on a conference call that part of the continuing @entity7 mission in @entity8 will involve training security forces in that country to ' help us ' defeat @entity12 – not the other way around			1
the @entity1 has sought to assure the press that the @entity7 role after 2014 would be reduced to what president @entity16 called ' an advisory role ' just an hour later			1
but the official 's statement , which drew no follow - up inquiry from the few reporters permitted to ask questions , indicates that @entity7 forces will take on a more substantial part of @entity8 's coming security needs			1
@entity16 said at the @entity1 that ' one year ago @entity8 security forces assumed the lead in combat operations , ' and that 2014 will be ' the year we will conclude our combat mission in @entity8			1
' but his senior surrogate told a different story			0
' we want to maintain a counterterrorism ability ' there to keep @entity12 in check , he said			1
' we 're going to train @entity39 to help us in mitigating that threat			1
' we have struck significant blows against @entity12 's leadership , ' @entity16 said			2
' we have eliminated @entity52			0
we have prevented @entity8 from being used to launch attacks against our homeland			0
' ' we 've helped train and equip [ @entity8 ] security forces , ' he added			0
' now we 're finishing the job we started			0
' still , @entity16 plans to leave 9,800 @entity7 troops in @entity8 at the end of the year , officially to continue training @entity8 fighters for their longer - term battles with @entity12 and to stymie insurgent attacks			1
and the senior official said that by the end of 2016 , one month before @entity16 leaves office , @entity7 's presence in @entity8 will be reduced to an ' embassy presence with a security assistance office			1
' that opens up the possibility that @entity57 , the sprawling 8 - square - mile center of @entity7 combat operations there , could be shuttered or turned over to @entity8			1
it could also be maintained with a skeleton crew in case the @entity7 needed to return in force , according to a @entity89 analyst who spoke with @entity90 on background			0
however they are deployed , servicemen and women are likely to remain in harm 's way			0
there are currently about 32,800 @entity7 serving in @entity8 , down from a high of about 100,000 in the middle of 2010			0
@entity16 promised during his february 2013 @entity99 to @entity100 that the @entity7 effort there would draw to a close by the end of 2014			2
vague message : ' this year we will bring the war in @entity8 to a responsible end , ' @entity16 said -- but he 's leaving 9,800 servicemen and women behind president @entity16 made his sixth visit to @entity8 over the weekend , but just his first since winning re-election in 2012 he said sunday that he has ' made it clear that we ’re prepared to continue cooperating with our @entity8 partners on two security missions : training and equipping @entity8 forces and targeting – counterterrorism targets – against @entity12			1
' @entity1 armed services chairman @entity119 , a @entity121 @entity120 , blasted the president 's move on tuesday			2
' holding this mission to an arbitrary egg - timer does n’t make a lick of sense strategically , ' @entity119 said in a statement			0
telegraphing military deployment and withdrawal timetables to @entity7 's enemies has become a bone of contention for @entity16 , even among otherwise friendly national security experts			1
' good for @entity16 for keeping 9,800 troops in @entity8 as requested by @entity136 , ' tweeted @entity138 scholar @entity137			2
' too bad he is imposing a counterproductive timeline			0
' and @entity140 , the director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian @entity142 , tweeted a mocking note : ' if you like your 2014 @entity8 withdrawal date , you can keep it			0
' ' holding this mission to an arbitrary egg - timer doesn ¿ t make a lick of sense strategically ' : rep. @entity119 , the @entity120 chairman of the @entity150 , slammed @entity16 's move a prickly @entity16 scolded a reporter from the @entity154 website on tuesday during an educational event at the @entity1 after she asked him a question about @entity8			1
' i ’m sorry , we ’re doing a science fair – c’mon			0
c’mon , ' @entity16 said before walking out of the room			0
other congressional republicans issued their thoughts on @entity16 's announcements late tuesday afternoon			1
@entity164 ranking @entity120 @entity165 of @entity166 said in a statement that in hearings and meetings with military leaders ' it has been determined that we need 13,000 troops on the ground to best accomplish the mission with @entity8 [ sic ] security forces			2
' ' anything less , and we are putting more lives at risk , ' he said			0
and @entity182 chairman @entity181 , a @entity183 @entity120 , said he doubt the policy ' reflected by these numbers and timelines ' that the president outlined			0
' even now , an @entity12 safe haven is emerging in northeastern @entity8 ; and i question whether the enemy will take further advantage of the announced timeline to renew its efforts to launch new operations , as we see them attempting in @entity197 and @entity198 today			2
' @entity7 military personnel will only remain in the country if its president signs a @entity202 – something @entity204 has resisted but his likely successors say they will embrace			1
that document is intended to formalize @entity7 efforts to train @entity8 and launch counterterrorism operations			1
' already , we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women , ' @entity16 said in this @entity99 speech 15 months ago			0
' this spring , our forces will move into a support role , while @entity8 security forces take the lead			0
' ' tonight , i can announce that over the next year , another 34,000 @entity7 troops will come home from @entity8			1
this drawdown will continue and by the end of next year , our war in @entity8 will be over			2
' loophole : @entity16 has insisted he will not keep any @entity7 in @entity8 without a signed security agreement that would grant those forces immunity from @entity8 law ' for many of you , this will be your last tour in @entity8 , ' @entity16 said to applause -- but nearly 10,000 will end up staying but the president still alluded to that security agreement that @entity204 refused to sign , saying the @entity7 aimed to remain in - country to actively hunt down @entity12 and help @entity8 do the same			1
' beyond 2014 , @entity7 ’s commitment to a unified and sovereign @entity8 will endure , ' @entity16 said , ' but the nature of our commitment will change			2
' ' we 're negotiating an agreement with the @entity8 government that focuses on two missions – training and equipping @entity8 forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos , and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of @entity12 and their affiliates			1
instead of a total withdrawal , the senior @entity1 official confirmed , @entity7 troop numbers would drop by half by the end of next year and dwindle near zero by the time @entity16 leaves office			1
@entity16 doubled down on his promise four months ago in his 2014 @entity99 address , this time promising that only a ' small force ' would remain behind after 2014			1
' more than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from @entity8 , ' he told @entity100 on january 28			2
' with @entity8 forces now in the lead for their own security , our troops have moved to a support role			2
' ' together with our allies , we will complete our mission there by the end of this year , and @entity7 ’s longest war will finally be over			2
' ' if the @entity8 government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated , ' he added , ' a small force of @entity7 could remain in @entity8 with @entity273 allies			1
' the 9,800 @entity7 troops who remain after december will be mainly stationed in @entity275 and at @entity57			2
@entity16 visited @entity57 on sunday , surprising servicemen and women with a pledge to bring @entity7 ’s longest war to a ' responsible end ' by the close of the year			1
he said then that the war had reached a pivotal point since with @entity8 forces were prepared to take primary responsibility for their country ’s security			0
@entity57 ? @entity16 spoke sunday at @entity57 , but its future is uncertain as the @entity1 plans to have nothing more by the end of @entity16 's presidency than an embassy with a security office nearby @entity16 was greeted by @entity7 ambassador to @entity8 @entity295 ( c ) and @entity297 general @entity296 , commander of the @entity7 - led @entity299 ( @entity300 ) -- the men who will preside over a continued @entity7 presence there ' for many of you , this will be your last tour in @entity8 , ' @entity16 told hundreds of @entity7 troops inside an airplane hangar on sunday ' @entity7 ’s war in @entity8 will come to a responsible end			1
' but ' @entity7 's commitment to the people of @entity8 will endure , ' he added			0
' after all the sacrifices we 've made , we want to preserve the gains you have helped to win			0
' the president was expected to make an announcement about @entity8 on wednesday during a speech at the @entity320 at @entity320			0
instead , the @entity1 elected to make a @entity322 announcement tuesday afternoon			2
elections are underway to replace @entity204 , the only president @entity8 has known since the @entity7 - led invasion in 2001			1
he and @entity16 have spoken just once in the past year			0
at least 2,181 @entity7 military personnel have died during the nearly 13 - year @entity8 war			1
@entity16 has staked much of his foreign policy philosophy on ending the two wars he inherited from his predecessor , @entity329			0
the final @entity7 troops withdrew from @entity197 in the closing days of 2011 after the @entity7 and @entity197 failed to reach a security agreement to keep a small @entity7 residual force in the country			1
in the years that have followed the @entity7 withdrawal , @entity197 has been battered by resurgent waves of violence			0
@entity7 officials say they 're trying to avoid a similar scenario			0
@entity8 ' will not be a perfect place			0
and it is not @entity7 's responsibility to make it one , ' @entity16 said tuesday in the @entity322			2
' @entity7 have learned that it 's harder to end wars than it is to begin them – but this is how wars end in the 21st century			0

a senior @entity1 official told reporters tuesday that ' we want to maintain a counterterrorism ability *...* we 're going to train @entity39 to help us in mitigating that threat '
but @entity16 said tuesday afternoon that in 2015 ' @entity8 will be fully responsible for securing their country ' and the @entity7 will be limited to ' an advisory role '
' this year we will bring the war in @entity8 to a responsible end , ' he said
the conference - call official said by the end of 2016 the @entity7 would have only an ' embassy presence with a security assistance office ' – meaning @entity57 could be closed or given to the @entity8
@entity16 said in january 's that only ' a small force ' of @entity7 might stay behind , but nearly 10,000 @entity7 military personnel will remain
originally the @entity1 said they would help a few thousand @entity273 troops train @entity8 fighters , and man ' counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of @entity12 '
president @entity204 has not signed a @entity202 that would keep @entity7 personnel there while making them immune from @entity8 law ; both of his possible successors have said they will sign it
