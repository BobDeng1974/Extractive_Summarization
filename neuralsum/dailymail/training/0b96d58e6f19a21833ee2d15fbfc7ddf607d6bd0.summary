there , facing the void , she told @entity32 that she was n't really happy and she believed she should not be married , she said			2
they argued and it escalated , culminating with @entity32 grabbing her , @entity6 said			2
she thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that 's when she became angry			0
' i was n't thinking about where we were , ' she said			0
' she said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder , and he went over the edge			0

she drove back home to @entity116 , about an hour away , without seeking help			0

' at that moment , i was so scared , i did n't know what to do , ' she said			0
@entity32 was reported missing on july 8 when he failed to show up for work			1
