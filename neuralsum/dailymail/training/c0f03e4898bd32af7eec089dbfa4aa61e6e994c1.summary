by @entity0 a symbol of the @entity5 outback and a traditional shield against the harsh beating sun , the @entity2 hat has been @entity5 made and owned for more than 130 years			1
but as @entity5 â€™s rabbit numbers continue to shrink and domestic suppliers dwindle , the brand has been forced to import 65 - 70 per cent of its materials from sources overseas - predominately @entity13			1
each hat is made from about 12 rabbit skins , an easy feat back in the early 20th century for the factory based in @entity18 , @entity19 , when rabbits plagued the countryside			1
iconic : the @entity2 hat is a symbol of the @entity5 outback and has recently seen huge demand from @entity25 and also @entity26 with rabbit skins used to make the hats , as the animals ' numbers have steadily decline in @entity5 , @entity2 has had to find overseas suppliers , including @entity13 @entity2 's managing director @entity32 , told the @entity33 that the iconic brand had a long and proud history			1
' rabbit fur is the best fur to make our hats out of , and the rabbit industry in the ' 40s and ' 50s was absolutely enormous , wild rabbits that is , there was no farmed rabbits in those days , ' mr @entity32 said			2
' it started off in @entity48 as a fur - cutting business and we moved up to @entity50 and started making hats			2
my great - grandfather married the boss 's daughter and generations later i 'm here now			0
' still vastly popular from its onset , @entity2 hats still sell like wild fire with the biggest buyers outside of the consistent rural community including the @entity63 with which the company holds a five - year contract			1
but the biggest and most recent fan of the @entity5 hats is @entity25 , which mr @entity32 described as ' going gangbusters ' with the product			0
@entity2 started in @entity48 and eventually moved to @entity50			0
today , its factory is located in @entity18 , on @entity19 north coast he said @entity26 was expected to buy about 12,000 hats from the little company this year alone , easily becoming @entity2 's biggest importer			1
but producing the hats has become more and more problematic over the last decade due to the great success of the @entity78			2
introduced to rabbits in the 1990s to control the pest 's numbers and protect native wildlife , the solution has reduced rabbit numbers by about 90 per cent			1
consequently , rabbit farms have dwindled as vaccines for farmers prove expensive , with three large companies closing in the last year or so			2
mr @entity32 is left with no choice but to look towards overseas suppliers for his company , with his biggest source coming from @entity13			0
' we just ca n't get it here			0
and what we can get is expensive and not of very good quality so we have to supplement that with stuff from overseas			0
basically i can import fur from @entity101 and put it on a plane and have it here within a week			0
' despite the challenges , mr @entity32 confirmed the production process will remain in @entity5 .			0
