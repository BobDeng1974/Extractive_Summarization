when sir @entity1 left @entity2 after 27 years at the helm , he was sure he had left the club in good hands			1
@entity6 was his personally selected predecessor , and though that did n't work out , he was sure to have approved @entity9 's appointment given his track record			1
but after a less - than - ideal start for the @entity14 boss in charge , despite huge transfer fees being shelled out by @entity2 , it 's time to look at the damning numbers			0
but after his departure , that rate has dropped down to 50 per cent with just 29 wins from @entity6 ( @entity36 does n't have one yet ) , from 58 games			1
and it 's not like @entity2 have n't been backed in the transfer market			0
chief executive @entity40 , who replaced @entity41 at the same time as @entity1 's departure , has admitted it has been tough to attract big names but has still managed to pay out way beyond what sir @entity1 was spending per season			1
in fact , @entity2 have spent £ 199.1million @entity49			0
@entity50 ( £ 1.5m ) , @entity51 ( £ 27.5m ) , @entity52 ( £ 37.1m ) , @entity53 ( £ 30m ) , @entity54 ( £ 29m ) , @entity55 ( £ 16m ) and @entity19 ( £ 60m ) have all arrived , but there is still a lack of identity in this line - up			0
the numbers count : @entity2 have lost 18 times @entity62 compared to 10 in 2012/13 money spent : @entity2 have spent almost £ 200m in three transfer windows , including @entity19 @entity50 , £ 1.5m @entity51 , £ 27.5m @entity52 , £ 37.1m @entity53 , £ 30m @entity54 £ 29m @entity55 , £ 16m @entity19 , £ 60m total £ 199.1m @entity2 have been craving an authoritative central midfielder for several years , while a dominant centre - back should have been the priority ahead of the 2014/15 season			2
@entity19 , while an outstanding talent , will not solve @entity2 's problems at the back			2
players such as @entity54 have been brought in to try and improve @entity2 's passing game , which suffered last season under @entity6			1
their average possession is at 53.79 , compared to 56.16 in 2012/13			0
meanwhile , it 's not just the wins that have dried up but the goals too			0
in @entity1 's final title - winning season @entity2 scored 114 goals from 54 games , compared to 96 with @entity6 , @entity36 and even @entity83 at the helm			1

dejection : @entity6 was sacked last season as @entity2 did n't even finish in the top six of the @entity89			2

@entity2 's win rate in @entity1 's final season was 67 per cent
@entity6 and @entity9 's *tenures* has seen that drop to 50 per cent
@entity2 's possession and goals scored stats also *vastly* *decreased*
@entity36 's side lost 4 - 0 to @entity26 in the @entity27 on tuesday
