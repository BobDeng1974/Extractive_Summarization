as you might imagine , being a professional alligator trapper , the job comes with some inherent dangers			1
firstly , there 's always the possibility that you could fall into the swap or lake you 've been assigned to , or get bitten by the mosquitoes			0
however , there is always that niggling possibility that the gator itself might try and get the better of you			0
residents of @entity33 near @entity34 , spotted a 20 pound gator several months back in their usually peaceful lake			1
since last fall , reports of the 3 ½ - foot gator , large enough to eat a small dog , was seen lurking beneath its still waters			1
it made the residents feel uneasy , especially if the gator grew any larger			0
they called upon the services of @entity48 husband & wife team , @entity50 & @entity17 whose specialism is trapping these scaly creatures once and for all			1
no choice : @entity17 has the gator by its tail - he 's coming out whether he likes it or not ! got him : within two minutes of spotting him , @entity17 had the gator by his tail it was n't long before the target was spotted basking in the spring @entity31 sunshine			1
it took them four days before they were able to get close enough to capture it			2
' it needs to be that first try to get him when he 's like , ' i do n't really know what they 're doing , '' @entity68 told local station @entity74			2
oh snap ! @entity17 was n't expecting that - and he does this for a living ! bonded : the alligator is well and truly attached to @entity17 at this point , and probably thinks he 's got himself a juicy meal making his mark : @entity17 wo n't forget this rescue any time soon			1
the alligator left between 15 - 20 teethmarks on his arm @entity17 went to grab it , tail first of course , but what happened next he did not expect			2
the aggravated alligator spun its head around and bit into @entity17 's forearm , tearing at his skin			2
when alligators bite they can exert a jaw pressure of 3000 pounds per square inch			0
it 's not an easy task trying to remove them			0
' if he would have started rolling , he could have bit a chuck out of his arm , ' @entity50 , said			0
' there 's a gator bite for ya , ' @entity17 laughed			0
' put the pole down			0
grab his head , ' he told her			0
with his wife 's help , @entity17 was finally able to free the alligator and its teeth from his arm			2
see you later : @entity16 captured and pond secured , the reptile will likely be taken to a local zoo so children can enjoy their beauty and learn about their dangers no messing : alligators can grow up to 14t long weigh over 450 kg. they can have up to 75 teeth the gator certainly left its mark with around 20 teeth marks , but the residents are pleased that finally their pond is at last gator - free			1
it 's not known how the alligator ended up in the pond but it is likely that it was once a pet whose owner was unable to look after it once it grew larger .			1
