by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:03 est , 6 february 2014 @entity4 ’s billion - star surveyor @entity5 is slowly being brought into focus as it begins its mission to create the most accurate map of the @entity9 begins			1
launched in december , the satellite has now reached its destination 1.5 million km from @entity12			0
engineers are currently commissioning @entity5 's two telescopes and its three instruments , getting them ready to begin mapping the precise positions and motions of one - thousand - million stars			1
@entity5 ’s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the @entity9			1
it will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about 1 % of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home @entity36 to help answer questions about its origin and evolution			0
repeatedly scanning the sky , @entity5 will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years			0
in addition to positions and motions , @entity5 will also measure key physical properties of each star , including its brightness , temperature and chemical composition			0
eventually , the @entity5 data archive will exceed a million @entity57 , equivalent to about 200 000 dvds of data its first test image shows a dense cluster of stars in the @entity23 , a satellite galaxy of the @entity9			1
once @entity5 starts making routine measurements , it will generate truly enormous amounts of data			2
to maximise the key science of the mission , only small ‘ cut - outs ’ centred on each of the stars it detects will be sent back to @entity12 for analysis			0
this test picture , taken as part of commissioning the mission to ‘ fine tune ’ the behaviour of the instruments , is one of the first proper ‘ images ’ to be seen from @entity5 , but ironically , it will also be one of the last			1
professor @entity82 , from the @entity83 and @entity85 principal investigator for @entity5 , said : ' seeing the first magnificent images from @entity5 ’s @entity85 - built billion pixel camera first of all generates a huge vote of thanks to all those scientists and engineers who have worked so hard to make this happen			2
' second , it provides just a tiny taste of the excellence and challenges ahead , to turn @entity5 data into human understanding of the @entity9 's origins			1
' one substantial step for astronomy , one huge leap still to come			0

@entity85 participation in the mission is funded by the @entity122 and scientists and engineers from around the @entity85 have played key roles in the design and build of @entity5			2
dr @entity127 , acting director of technology , @entity129 and @entity130 at the @entity122 , said : ' @entity5 is an important space mission for the @entity85 ; we ’ve won around € 80 million of contracts from the @entity134 to build the spacecraft and are providing a @entity136 that will turn the mission ’s raw data into the largest stellar catalogue ever made			1

liftoff ! @entity154 , with @entity5 space observatory , lifted off from @entity4 's @entity156 , @entity157 , on 19 december 2013			2
to achieve its goal , @entity5 will spin slowly , sweeping its two telescopes across the entire sky and focusing the light from their separate fields simultaneously onto a single digital camera – the largest ever flown in space , with nearly a billion pixels			2
but first , the telescopes must be aligned and focused , along with precise calibration of the instruments , a painstaking procedure that will take several months before @entity5 is ready to enter its five - year operational phase			2
while all one billion of @entity5 ’s target stars will have been observed during the first six months of operations , repeated observations over five years will be needed to measure their tiny movements to allow astronomers to determine their distances and motions through space			0
as a result , @entity5 ’s final catalogue will not be released until three years after the end of the nominal five - year mission			0
@entity189 data releases will be made , however , and if rapidly changing objects such as supernovae are detected , alerts will be released within hours of data processing , its operators say			0
eventually , the @entity5 data archive will exceed a million @entity57 , equivalent to about 200 000 dvds of data .			1
