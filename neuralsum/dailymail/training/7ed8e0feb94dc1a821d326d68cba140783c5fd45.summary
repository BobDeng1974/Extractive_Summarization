and the police officer who looks after @entity16 the dog is n’t bad at his job either			1
the four - year - old @entity20 shepherd , pictured in training , is said to be @entity23 ’s best police dog after making 142 arrests in 2012 alongside his handler			1
among those @entity16 has snared is an @entity28 protester who smashed a female police officer over the back of her head			1
the dog was kicked and punched in the process of detaining the culprit , but avoided serious injury			2
last month , he used his impeccable tracking skills to find a missing girl who had wandered off after a serious car crash			1
‘ i have an exceptional bond with @entity16 , ’ said pc @entity5 , of @entity41 , who was partnered with @entity16 in 2009			1
‘ we depend on each other			0
we know each other ’s strengths and weaknesses and we know our limits			0
but he can be frustrating sometimes			0
a dog ’s mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18 - month - old baby , it constantly wants attention			1
he just wants to work all the time			0
' a dog 's mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18 - month - old baby , it constantly wants attention			1
but he is one of the family			0
' the @entity20 lives in kennels at the home of dog support unit inspector pc @entity65 and his partner @entity67 , who is also a dog handler looks and after @entity69			1
the couple met through the unit in 2008 and now have three daughters , @entity73 , eight , @entity74 , five , and @entity75 , three			0
last month @entity16 and @entity76 , who lives with his partner were awarded a @entity79 for their sterling work			1
@entity81 , who will be five years old in february , lives outside their house with @entity69 , but the competitive canines have a slightly strained relationship , despite being friendly dogs			0
it was by chance that @entity16 formed his winning partnership with @entity76			1
the officer was originally assigned to another dog when he joined the unit in 2008 , but the animal was sent to the military because of behavioural problems			2
solving mysteries : @entity16 has always held the advanced licence , which judges the pair on the dog 's obedience and the control the handler has over the animal @entity16 trained for three months together before they were ready for action and the dogs licence is now reissued each year			1
he has always held the advanced licence , which judges the pair on the dog 's obedience and the control the handler has over the dog			1
together they have experienced an array of testing situations , but one in particular stands out for @entity76			0
he said : ' back in 2009 we were called to attend an @entity28 march in @entity115 , @entity116 - on @entity117 where more than 100 members were involved			2
' we were being attacked from the front and back as well as trying to protect some of the officers when a male protester struck a female officer on the back of the head			2
' i monitored him until i saw him get out of hand again			0
then i deployed @entity81 to detain him			0
pure talent : dog support inspector @entity65 puts @entity16 through his paces			1
the clever dog has detained and arrested almost one criminal every three days ' @entity16 was kicked and punched in the process but luckily he was n't injured seriously and was able to detain the offender who was then arrested and convicted for violent disorder			1
' i think he was given two - and - a - half years in the end and the judge commended mine and @entity16 's bravery			1
i think that has been the biggest demand on the pair of us just because of the sheer volatility of the people involved			0
' only last week , they had another success in finding a missing girl			1
@entity76 said : ' she was in a serious car crash and sustained injuries but managed to get out and wander off before we could get there			0
' @entity16 was able to track and we got her back safe and sound			1
without the dog , it would have taken a lot longer			2
' it can take a dog just 30 minutes to pick up a track but obviously it depends on the circumstances			2
i find tracking the most rewarding because it heavily relies on you as a team			0
' tough cookie : @entity81 was kicked and punched during an @entity28 protest - but managed to detain the offender , who was convicted for violent disorder ' you realise how having a dog helps solve so many more crimes			1
without a police dog you perhaps would n't catch as many suspects			2
' for the @entity16 it 's fun , training and work is like playing in the park for him			1
' for everything he does successfully i reward him with a ball or something like that			0
' together they work shift patterns of six days on , four days off in one of the most successful police dog support units in the country			1
@entity76 suggested their success could be due to the area they cover and type of crimes that are committed			0
the unit also consists of 12 specialist dogs , who are trained to search for a variety of substances and articles			0
some are trained to search for explosives only and are used to scan suspicious packages and carry out searches of areas prior to the arrival of persons such as ministers and the @entity214			0
on the scent : just last week , the duo had another success in finding a missing girl and bringing her home other dogs are used to search for drugs and firearms			1
some have additional skills to search for cash			2
so far this year , the unit has carried out 365 searches for drugs , firearms and cash			0
one dog in particular , @entity231 , has had immense success along with handler pc @entity233			0
this year , @entity231 's best finds include a single stash of cannabis to the value of £ 150,000 and £ 200,000 cash hidden in a car			0
the vehicle had been searched several times by police officers and it was not until @entity231 had a go that the cash was found in a secret location			0
@entity76 and @entity16 were awarded the @entity79 last tuesday for their good work , continued excellent performance , motivation and achievement			2
@entity250 said : ' in training @entity16 fares very well in comparison to the other dogs , especially with the guidance of his handler			2
they really put the practice in and we 're really proud			0

the law - *enforcing* hound has detained at least one criminal every three days
@entity16 has always held an advanced licence for his policing skills
he was commended for bravery after helping to arrest a violent protester
just last week , the clever dog brought a missing girl home to safety
