by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 19 april 2013 campaigners are pushing for chemical castration to be introduced as a way of treating sex offenders in the @entity5			1
the medical treatment which decreases mens ' sex drives using hormones , is already mandatory for child sex offenders in @entity11 , @entity12 and certain @entity14 states			1
the treatment is gaining popularity in @entity17 too , where dr @entity18 , an expert in sexual behaviour who advocates it as a way to treat sex offenders , holds a clinic			1
today as part of the @entity28 's @entity27 hosts @entity24 and @entity25 spoke to dr @entity18 and one of his patients ' @entity30 ' ( not his real name ) who volunteered himself for chemical castration after his rape and murder fantasies started to become dangerous			1
as part of their @entity27 programming @entity28 hosts @entity25 and @entity24 interviewed dr @entity18 , an expert in sexual behaviour , and one of his patients ' @entity30 ' in his early twenties , @entity30 started to fantasise about raping and killing women			1
he would seek out women as he drove around in his car , and even planned the ' perfect crime '			0
fortunately his plan backfired and , so concerned was he that he was a risk to women , he sought help from dr @entity52 who put him on a programme of chemical castration , to decrease his sex drive			1
disguising his identity with a hooded jacket and speaking with his back to the camera @entity30 said : ' it started with me cheating on my then partner , this led to me looking online to meet people and everything progressed from there			2
' the sex became more boring over time so i started looking for more extreme methods			0
' i enjoyed the challenge of meeting someone online and seeing how fast i could get them in to bed			0
' it progressed to being more violent and then the fantasies of sexual assault and rape started ... and then i thought of killing the women i was sleeping with			2
' @entity30 ( right ) volunteered himself for chemical castration after his rape and murder fantasies started to become dangerous talking about the night that his darkest fantasies almost became a reality @entity30 said : ' i went out that night to do it			1
i purchased specific tools and had them in the trunk of my car			0
chemical castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production of testosterone , leading to a decreased sex drive			1
@entity11 introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009 , it was introduced in @entity96 in september and @entity12 and @entity97 are following suit			1
both @entity99 and the @entity100 have been criticised by @entity102 's top human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex offenders			2
' i drove around and got an individual in to my car			0
it was easy , but i never harmed her			0
' @entity30 's therapists believe that it was the fact that he started a conversation with the women that saved her life			2
@entity30 , who had a girlfriend throughout the time , said : ' what i discovered with my therapist is that when it came to people that i knew i had no interest in assaulting or raping them			0
my girlfriend was never harmed			0
' @entity30 volunteered himself to undergo chemical castration and counselling with dr @entity125 and was assessed as being extremely dangerous according to the standard phallometric test			1
once he started the treatment he noticed results almost immediately			0
he said : ' the removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly and made me a lot more comfortable			2
i lost interest in acting out my thoughts , i had no sex for a year and a half			0
' dr @entity136 said : ' it is certainly no quick fix , but almost every time we do this things turn out very well			2
' @entity30 told @entity24 and @entity25 that he noticed results almost immediately , he said : ' the removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly			1
i lost interest in acting out my thoughts			0
' see the full interview on the @entity28 website			0

@entity30 *claims* that he would have killed somebody without the treatment
