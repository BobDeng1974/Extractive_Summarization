by @entity1 reporter published : 09:27 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 19:00 est , 4 january 2014 a @entity4 medical student examining a fake patient as part of his training has saved the actor 's life by spotting a life - threatening condition			1
@entity11 was taking part in a university program , where actors pretend to have a list of ailments that the doctor must diagnose , when he found an abdominal aortic aneurism			2
at first the student thought his fake patient , @entity20 , knew he had the condition and was a decoy , but he decided to speak up just in case			1
praise : @entity20 , pictured with wife @entity25 , says junior doctor @entity11 , right , saved his life ' i said , " i think i found an aneurism " and he played along because that 's his job and so i 'm like " does he actually know he has this ? " , ' mr @entity11 told @entity32 7			1
because mr @entity20 had coincidentally been asked to pretend to have the symptoms of the aneurism , he did n't realize the junior doctor had accurately spotted the real condition until later			1
' i really did n't think anything of it until the supervising doctor told me they had discovered something , ' mr @entity20 said			0
' he thought i might have been a ringer that was planted in there to test him , and i had no symptoms			0
he thought i was a plant with the real situation , ' mr @entity20 told @entity46			0
he and his wife @entity47 have been taking part in the university 's standardized patient program for years , where actors are given a list of symptoms to pretend to have so they can test the abilities of junior doctors			2
test : medical student @entity11 thought his test patient was a decoy relief : @entity25 and @entity20 are grateful to @entity11 who spotted the aneurism even though mr @entity20 had no symptoms ' @entity20 's life was saved by a @entity4 medical student , no doubt about it , ' mrs @entity62 said			1
after it was spotted in march her husband had stent surgery to fix the aneurism which , if left untreated could have led to internal bleeding			0
the condition can develop for years without having any symptoms , which was the case for mr @entity20			0
mr @entity11 , who is in his last year of medical school and plans to become a radiation oncologist , said : ' it feels great to know that i made a difference			0

fake patient had no idea he had aneurism until junior doctor spotted it
@entity11 thought a decoy had been planted to test his abilities
