by @entity0 the parents of missing @entity2 today hit out angrily at the former @entity4 police chief they are suing after the case was halted when he sacked his lawyer just as they were due to appear in court			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , who flew from their home in @entity12 , @entity13 , to @entity14 to appear in their libel action against @entity17 over claims he made in his book about the hunt for their daughter , gave an angry impromptu press conference outside court today			1
mrs @entity25 told reporters : ' it brings us more pain and distress every time we come here			0
' she said @entity17 could have got rid of his legal team before they left @entity35 for @entity4 , and when asked if she believed the 11th hour move was part of his strategy , her husband replied : ' clearly			1
later , the @entity48 strode out behind their lawyer , @entity49 , to speak to waiting reporters mrs @entity25 added : ' mr @entity17 handed that letter in apparently around nine o'clock this morning - that letter could have been handed in before we left the country			1
' and this has happened about four times			0
this ca n't be seen an anything but blatant and cynical			0
' clearly angry and upset , she went on : ' we need to make it clear to people : we took on this case because of the pain and distress that mr @entity17 has brought to us and our children			1
she said : ' mr @entity17 is not the victim in this ' , and detailed all the arrangements she and her husband had had to make to get to @entity14 , saying : ' every time we come here we have to make arrangements for our children to be looked after , we have to take time off work			1
' her husband added : ' we 're exasperated that the hearing has been cancelled once again at mr @entity17 's request - this is the fourth time this has happened and we 've travelled to @entity4			1
' the legal case has been running now for over five years and we want to get justice for @entity80			1
' today is a blatant and cynical attempt to wear us down and it 's @entity80 who is suffering			2
we 're not going to give up - we 're going to keep going			0
' the libel trial against @entity84 over unfounded allegations in his book , @entity88 , that the @entity48 hid their daughter 's body after an accident and faked an abduction , has now been postponed to give the defendant time to find a new lawyer			1
the next hearing has been set for 8 july and mr @entity9 said he and his wife would attend then			2
the @entity48 ' lawyer , @entity49 , today said : ' no - one imagined that this could happen			1
' she said delays meant that the book could continue making ' severe damages ' against the @entity48			1
asked if the latest move by the former detective was a strategic attempt to delay the trial , she said it was ' clear ' that if someone wanted to remove their lawyer 's powers , they would substitute him in the same day			1
earlier today the @entity48 arrived at court to tell how accusations in @entity17 's book about the hunt for their daughter have affected them			1
mr and mrs @entity25 were originally told they could not make statements to the long - running trial , but the decision was overturned after an appeal by their lawyer			1
arriving earlier : @entity8 and @entity9 were to give evidence in the case against ex police chief , @entity17 the parents of @entity80 , left , are suing mr @entity17 , right , over his 2008 book @entity129 : the truth of the lie they were expected to deliver emotional statements at @entity14 's @entity134 , describing how the claims by mr @entity17 have caused them unnecessary grief			1
their appearance was due to mark the end of the trial , but a final ruling on the case is not expected until later this year			1
last week , the couple 's spokesman @entity143 confirmed that they were planning to attend court after the judge decided they could speak at the trial after all			1
their daughter @entity80 , who was then nearly four , disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment in @entity154 in the @entity155 on 3 may 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends			2
her parents say that claims in mr @entity17 's 2008 book , including suggestions that they hid @entity80 's body after she died in an accident and faked an abduction , damaged the hunt for their daughter and exacerbated their anguish			1
in october mr @entity9 's sister , @entity168 , told the libel trial that the couple 's pain over their daughter 's disappearance was ' multiplied 100 times ' by the book , and they had been left in ' purgatory ' by the disappearance of @entity80 , and claims that they were somehow involved			1
if successful the family stands to gain around £ 1 million in damages			1
the @entity48 ' court appearance comes after they last week said the fact police found no evidence relating to their missing daughter during recent searches in @entity154 had reinforced their belief that she could still be alive			2
@entity9 said he would not give up on his quest for justice for his missing daughter @entity9 : ' we 're exasperated that the hearing has been cancelled once again at mr @entity17 's request			1
' this is the fourth time this has happened and we 've travelled to @entity4			0
' the legal case has been running now for over five years and we want to get justice for @entity80			2
' today is a blatant and cynical attempt to wear us down and it 's @entity80 who is suffering			2
' we 're not going to give up - we 're going to keep going			0
' [ on the recent searches around @entity154 ] ' what is clear is that the searches have n't found any evidence to show that @entity80 has been seriously injured or is dead			2
' as far as we are concerned there is a good chance she is still alive and we have to keep searching for her - that 's why we are here			0
' @entity25 said every visit to @entity4 brought fresh distress to her and her family @entity25 we need to make it clear to people : we took on this case because of the pain and distress that mr @entity17 has brought to us and our children			1
' and every time he postpones the case like this it brings us more pain and distress			0
' every time we come here we have to make arrangements for our children to be looked after , we have to book flights , we have to book hotels , we have to take time off work to come here			2
' and mr @entity17 handed that letter in apparently around nine o'clock this morning			2
that letter could have been handed in before we left the country			0
' and this has happened about four times			0
as @entity9 said , this ca n't be seen as anything but blatant and cynical			0
' mr and mrs @entity25 said they were ' very pleased ' with the significant activity that had taken place in the @entity155 resort and it was ' gratifying ' to know that a substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months			0
during searches of three areas of land over 10 days , detectives found no evidence relating to @entity80 , saying the recent activity was only the first phase of the investigation and more would be carried out ' shortly '			2
in a statement , the @entity48 said : ' we are very pleased that significant activity has taken place in @entity154 over the last 10 days with police officers and support teams from the @entity44 working closely with the @entity259 and the @entity260			2
' we are further encouraged that despite the intensive searches , no trace of @entity80 has been found and this reinforces our belief that she could still be alive			0
' as parents of a missing child , we have always wanted all reasonable lines of inquiry to be followed and it is gratifying to know that a substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months with the close co-operation of the @entity44 and @entity4 authorities			0
' we would like to thank all those involved for their efforts and the members of the public who have come forward with information			0
' searches in the @entity4 resort saw officers from @entity286 's @entity285 working alongside specialists from around the @entity44 , including @entity288 and @entity289 , with the @entity4 police			0
the next stage of the operation will see police question three suspected burglars who were in the @entity154 area at the time of the disappearance in 2007 as well as five other men who worked at the @entity299 where the @entity48			0
@entity4 police will conduct the interviews , however @entity303 detectives , under detective chief inspector @entity304 will be allowed to sit in the room during questioning			0
a source in @entity4 told @entity308 : ' the questioning will be done by the @entity4 , either at @entity311 or @entity312 police stations			0
the men will be detained as " arguidos " - or formal suspects			0
' the @entity44 are ready to go at a moment 's notice , but the decision on when the questioning begins is for the @entity4 police			0
it could start as soon as late june			0
' the permission has been granted and there is not more legal paperwork to apply for			0

@entity8 and @entity9 rage outside court after trial halted at last minute
case is postponed for ten days after @entity17 sacked his lawyer
the couple were due to make statements about claims he made in 2008 book
they 're suing for libel over unfounded allegations in @entity88
it *wrongly* claimed the @entity48 hid her body after an accident and faked abduction
if successful , the pair from @entity12 , @entity13 , could win £ *1m* damages
@entity48 : ' @entity17 is not the victim here ' and say delay is part of his strategy
@entity9 : ' *remember* @entity80 is completely *innocent* in all of this '
