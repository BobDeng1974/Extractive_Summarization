by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 18:37 est , 6 september 2012 when grandmother @entity2 spotted a snake curled beneath @entity5 garden slates on her driveway , she calmly picked it up with ice cube tongs and trapped it in a box of celebrations			1
she might not have acted so decisively had she known exactly what she was tackling – for the 57 - year - old had in fact just encountered one of the deadliest snakes in the world			1
mrs @entity2 ’s experience at home in @entity20 , @entity21 , is the second time in a week that a saw - scaled viper has been seen in @entity24			1
snakes in a crate ! ms @entity2 snapped up the slippery stowaway with her trusty pair of tongs experts are now warning that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed by one of the snakes , because the authorities in @entity5 are not checking their shipments carefully			1
yesterday , mrs @entity2 described the moment she saw the snake in her front garden			1
she was having work done at home and her gardener was unpacking a crate of patio slates from @entity5 when he saw a 20 - inch snake curled at the bottom			1
he told mrs @entity2 and , with little hesitation , she reached in and grabbed the snake behind its head – as she had seen animal experts do on television			1
‘ he removed the last slab and there it was , ’ she said			2
‘ i came to see it and neighbours all came round and looked from an arm ’s length			2
‘ i caught it and put it in a sweet container			2
its tongue was out but i did n’t really look at it , it happened quickly			2
‘ we put the lid on the box but the box started moving			1
’ the saw scaled viper has a lethal bite that can cause bleeding and brain hemorrhages mrs @entity2 , a housing officer , called a vet , who sent expert reptile handlers to collect the snake			1
they called later to tell her just how dangerous the snake was , and the reptile is now with a licensed collector			2
‘ i was very lucky , ’ mrs @entity2 added			1
‘ but i would n’t have wanted it to have injured anyone else so i ’d do it again			2
’ though they are not the most venomous , saw - scaled vipers are among the deadliest snakes in the world because they attack so often , with some reports saying they kill more than any other snake			0
they live mainly in highly populated areas of @entity94 and @entity95			0
just one bite can be enough to kill , especially where treatment is not available			0
expert @entity98 said yesterday that it is only a matter of time before someone is killed if the vipers keep arriving in the @entity103 in shipments from @entity5			0
‘ the snakes are number one in the top ten dangerous snakes because they are so aggressive , ’ he said			0
‘ they strike faster than you can blink			0
it ’s amazing no one was killed			0
‘ a saw - scaled viper is like a loaded gun with a hair trigger			1
‘ when i went to collect the snake , i asked : “ is this @entity5 slate ? ” and then , very quickly : “ where is it ? ” ‘ in the car driving away it was jumping in the box on my wife ’s knee			1
we got it home and put it in a tank and it was striking the glass to get at me			0
‘ it was really feisty , even though it probably lost half its bodyweight from the journey			0
’ while it is extremely rare to see them in the @entity103 , two sightings have been reported in the past week			0
another saw - scaled viper was seen in @entity136 , in @entity137 , arriving in a giant shipping container from @entity5			1
mr @entity98 said the snakes could survive up to six months trapped in a shipping container			0
‘ i do n’t want to scaremonger but this is a time bomb , ’ he added			0
‘ there have been two in a week			0
they are getting through and if they colonise here we ’re in deep trouble			0

@entity2 picked the saw scale viper up and *plonked* it into a chocolate box
believed to be a stowaway that *hid* in a crate
