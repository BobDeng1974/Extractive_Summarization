having been built in @entity15 , @entity16 , the 100 - foot fuselages are loaded onto freight trains to be transported over the @entity19 where they are assembled on a literal giant conveyor belt as part of the @entity24 program			1
the constant flow of the jets across the nation are to fill the near - insatiable demand for air - travel globally , matched by @entity24 who declared late last year that they will increase the rate of 737 production at @entity12 to 47 jets a month by 2017 - more than 560 per year			1
mammoth : @entity24 fuselages are delivered by train to a @entity24 manufacturing site in @entity12 , @entity14 over the weekend conveyor : @entity24 officially cranked the production rate of its 737 @entity24 plane to 42 per month , an all - time high and hopes to be building 47 a month by 2017 from @entity15 : the fuselages have been built in @entity16 and have been transported over the @entity19 's to be delivered to @entity12 , @entity14 by 2017 , @entity24 and @entity43 will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month			1
both plane makers also are vying for a piece of the spare parts market , demanding royalties on parts that are sold directly to airlines and never enter their factories riding with the plane : these two @entity54 workers are accompanying the multi-million dollar freight cargo that has been transported from @entity16 to @entity14 long journey : the @entity7 actually starts at @entity57 in @entity15 , @entity16 and the fuselage is transported by train to @entity12 arrival : the fuselages arrive at the @entity62 in @entity14 in preparation for their transformation into the world 's most popular aircraft destination : @entity24 's 737 manufacturing site is pictured with the @entity70 skyline in the background in @entity12 , @entity14 february 26 , 2014 indeed , there is talk of the number of fuselages delivered by @entity57 of @entity15 , @entity16 rising to as many as 60 a month by the end of the decade			1
speaking to the @entity79 in june , @entity57 ceo @entity78 said that it was conceivable and that his firm would strive to do so			0
freight trains carrying complete 737 fuselages from spirit run from @entity15 , through @entity85 , along the @entity70 waterfront and straight into the @entity12 factory			1
there are approximately 5,600 747 's in service including , early 737 's - which represents a quarter of the total worldwide fleet of large commercial jets flying across the world there are 331 airlines in 111 countries that are flying 737s at any given second there are 2,000 737 planes in the air and one takes off or lands every 2 seconds across the model there are approximately 54,500 scheduled flights of 737s every day @entity24 737s have carried more than 16.4 billion passengers - equivalent to every man and woman on earth flying at least twice all @entity24 737s have flown more than 176.5 million flights since their launch the steady increase rate is planned to match the introduction of the newest 737 model , the @entity115 or @entity24			1
it will be the third generation derivative of the 737 and will include 4 variations able to seat between 110 to 210 passengers			0
the move is designed to keep up the staggering competition between @entity24 and the @entity122 multinational conglomerate , @entity43 and their @entity124 neo model			0
@entity43 last week said it will notch up production of its single - aisle a320 planes by nearly 10 percent , matching a similar move by @entity24			2
both companies also are building many of their double - aisle plans at faster rates			0
by 2017 , @entity24 and @entity43 will be churning out a staggering 138 new jetliners a month			2
@entity133 , @entity134 € ™ s 737 program vice president and general manager , said the move is aimed at meeting increased demand from airlines in an interview with the @entity79			0
' our employees and our suppliers have successfully increased the production rate to unmatched levels over the last three years , ' said @entity133			0
' this increase will lay a solid foundation as we bridge into production on the @entity115 ' however , @entity43 has already declared that it is steadily overtaking @entity24			2
while @entity24 has just over 1,600 firm orders for the @entity115 , @entity43 has more than 2,400 for the neo			0
the @entity24 is the best - selling and longest continuously produced commercial airliner of all time with over 10,500 deliveries and orders			2
with approximately 5,600 737s in service , 25 % of the worldâ € ™ s large jet fleet are @entity24 737s			0
and @entity12 is very much a part of that success with 40 percent of the world 's entire jetliner fleet having been built at @entity12			0

@entity24 is set to increase its 737 production in @entity12 to more than two airplanes per day end of line : the winglet of a @entity7 jetliner is pictured during a tour of the @entity7 assembly plant in @entity12 , @entity14 february 4 , 2014 planes are technical marvels that operate with great precision and safety , but the flying public still demands fares that cost less than a good hotel room , and jet fuel costs are likely to remain high			1
so airlines are driving hard bargains to pay as little as possible for jets @entity24 is selling some jets more aggressively , since @entity43 has gained 60 percent of the market for new single - aisle planes , a market that represents more than half of the new planes to be delivered over the next 20 years			0

@entity24 is to increase production of its staple @entity7 airliner to 47 jets a month by 2017
