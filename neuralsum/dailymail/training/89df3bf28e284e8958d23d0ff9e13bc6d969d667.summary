the former wife of an @entity2 sniper has sensationally claimed that she was paid cash to buy her silence about his astonishing accusation that princess @entity7 was murdered by the elite regiment			1
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons but who we will call @entity13 , says she was given a brown envelope stuffed with bank notes by an @entity2 officer who told her to ‘ keep quiet about @entity7 ’			1
the sniper ’s claim that the @entity2 was ‘ behind ’ princess @entity7 ’s death emerged last year at the court martial of sergeant @entity22 , who was found guilty of illegally possessing a handgun and ammunition			1
in hiding : the ex-wife of @entity26 says she now fears for her own safety after claiming to have been threatened by an @entity2 officer yesterday , speaking for the first time about her ‘ nightmare ’ marriage to the sniper known as @entity26 – who made the claim – 40 - year - old @entity13 revealed that : @entity13 , who is in hiding as she now fears for her own safety , said : ‘ the threatening and sinister way that the @entity2 dealt with me made what my husband had said about the regiment ’s role in @entity7 ’s death all the more believable			1
‘ i had never been handed £ 500 before and told to keep quiet about the payment and what it was for			0
‘ they wanted me to keep quiet about @entity7 and @entity2 operations			2
but i could n’t stay silent about something so serious			0
the payment was deeply suspicious and made me very uncomfortable			0
’ soldier n ’s claim that the @entity2 killed princess @entity7 was made in a letter written by the woman ’s mother to the regiment ’s commanding officer ( @entity54 ) in september 2011			1
sergeant @entity22 with his wife @entity55 @entity13 says that weeks later she was visited at her marital home by an @entity2 officer			1
soon after that , she had another meeting with a representative from a services ’ charity and two @entity2 officers who told her they were visiting her on behalf of the commanding officer			2
at this meeting @entity13 says the @entity2 officers repeatedly denied another claim made by @entity26 – also detailed in the letter sent to the @entity2 commanding officer – that troops from the elite regiment would encourage each other with rewards to harass or harm individuals who were causing them difficulties			2
the soldiers would apparently write the person ’s name , address and details on a slip of paper and place this in a box along with a cash payment			0
another meeting between the @entity2 officer and @entity13 took place in early 2012 when , she says , the officer handed over a brown envelope containing £ 500 and insisted that she should never discuss the payment with anyone , or discuss the @entity7 claim with anyone			1
@entity13 said last night : ‘ the strange thing was that at no time during this meeting did the officers mention what my ex-husband had said about the @entity2 being involved in princess @entity7 ’s death			1
’ indeed , the contents of the letter only became public knowledge last year following @entity105 ’s second court martial for possessing the gun and ammunition , when @entity26 appeared as a prosecution witness for the @entity109 against @entity110			1
@entity13 said : ‘ the fact that they stayed silent about @entity7 compounded my belief that my ex-husband had told me the truth in 2008 when he talked about an @entity2 soldier directing a beam of light into the eyes of princess @entity7 ’s chauffeur as their @entity120 entered the @entity122 road tunnel			1
my husband had added that after the @entity2 had caused the car to crash , a soldier had run back to the wreckage and looked inside to see how badly princess @entity7 was hurt			1
‘ apparently he then gave a signal to a colleague that their mission had been successful			0
so now i ’m convinced that this operation is the @entity2 ’s big secret			0
’ front line : soldier n pictured in the desert next to an @entity137 during the @entity138 in 2003 yet another meeting with the @entity2 took place in june last year , and it left @entity13 terrified			2
she says that at that meeting the @entity2 officer suggested that she could ‘ end up dead like the @entity144 soldier ’ @entity145 if she spoke out against the regiment			1
at the time she was separated from @entity26 and was struggling to pay her household bills			0
the officer collected the payment notices and promised her that he would take care of them for her			0
but just as he was leaving @entity13 ’s house the conversation apparently took a dark turn and she was asked whether she was going to give evidence against the @entity109 in its case against @entity105 , due to take place the following month			0
@entity13 recalled : ‘ the officer said that if i spoke out in support of @entity22 , and against my former husband who was the @entity109 ’s main prosecution witness , i might have cause to worry about my safety and my children ’s safety			2
‘ i was already shocked but he then said that if i went public with anything i knew i could “ end up dead like the @entity144 soldier ”			1
‘ he was staring at me the whole time he was saying this and he was very intimidating			0
last moments : princess @entity7 in her doomed car driving through @entity174 princess @entity7 and @entity175 inside the lift at the @entity177 ‘ i was really trembling as he left my house			2
thankfully i had arranged for @entity179 from the charity women ’s aid to be present			0
she heard what the officer was saying to me and gave a statement to @entity22 ’s solicitor , @entity185			0
’ ms @entity179 declined to comment on the incident last night , but mr @entity185 said : ‘ @entity179 overheard a conversation between the officer from the @entity2 and the former wife of @entity26 which touched on the fate of the @entity144 soldier @entity145			1
‘ the impression of @entity193 and the former wife was that this comment and others made by the officer about potential threats were intended to dissuade her from giving evidence on behalf of @entity200 at his second court martial			1
‘ the incident was reported to the @entity204 as the defence was concerned it may amount to an attempt to intimidate a witness			0
’ landmark : the @entity2 clock tower in @entity210 the regiment 's home town mr @entity185 added : ‘ this is a matter of deep concern			2
the @entity216 ’s standards unit has now launched an investigation			2
’ even though two inquiries – by @entity220 and the @entity222 police – had found princess @entity7 ’s death was an accident , the claim included in @entity13 ’s mother ’s letter led to the @entity216 to reopen @entity227 , the official @entity229 investigation into the fatal accident in @entity174 on august 31 , 1997			1
this led to yet another bizarre twist in the tale			0
as part of the new inquiry , on august 28 last year @entity13 and her mother attended a police station in @entity238 where they were interviewed by two senior detectives			0
at this meeting the officers handed her a copy of an email she had sent to her lawyer detailing her husband ’s ‘ erratic ’ behaviour during their marriage			1
the 17 - page document also briefly mentioned @entity26 ’s claim that the @entity2 had assassinated princess @entity7			1
@entity13 said last night : ‘ when i saw the statement i was shocked because i knew that i had not sent the email to anyone other than my divorce lawyer			0
' later i confirmed with her that she had not sent the email to any third party			0
so i am sure that the police intercepted this email			0
’ @entity220 ’s @entity257 is now investigating how their officers came to have a copy of the email			1
a @entity220 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the complaint which is the subject of an ongoing investigation			0
’ and an @entity265 spokesman said : ‘ as the @entity216 have said previously , when considering the allegations made in this letter they have found no evidential basis upon which to open any criminal investigation			2
‘ we take the welfare of our troops and their dependants extremely seriously and it is normal for service personnel and their families to be briefed on personal security measures , especially so at a time when they are likely to receive a high level of media attention			0

*incredible* story of key witness that has a terrifying ring of truth
@entity2 officer ' warned her that she would end up dead like @entity145 '
she has now gone into hiding claiming she fears for her own safety
sniper husband claimed that the @entity2 was ‘ behind ’ princess @entity7 ’s death
@entity220 detectives who probed the alleged @entity2 link to princess @entity7 ’s death are themselves now under *scrutiny* by the @entity216 ’s @entity257 over claims that they intercepted an email sent by the wife of soldier *n.*
an @entity2 officer warned her that she would ‘ end up dead like the @entity144 soldier ’ @entity145 if she gave evidence that *undermined* her former husband ’s witness *testimony* at @entity200 ’s court martial .
she told @entity2 top brass in 2010 that her husband was *unstable* and should not deploy to @entity315 the following year . soldier n was later found guilty of illegally possessing a high - *powered* pistol , a silencer , *hundreds* of rounds of ammunition and a hand *grenade* .
