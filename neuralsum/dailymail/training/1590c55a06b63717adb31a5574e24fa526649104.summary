by @entity0 published : 15:55 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 27 november 2013 claims : commons speaker @entity2 , pictured with wife @entity3 , said the scandal was a result of @entity6 becoming less ' meaningful ' politicians abused the expenses system as a ‘ displacement activity ’ because they were bored by an increasingly irrelevant @entity10 , @entity2 has claimed			1
the commons speaker prompted criticism when he blamed the expenses scandal on @entity6 becoming less ‘ meaningful ’ rather than on collective ‘ malice or corruption ’			1
the scandal has resulted in four mps and two members of the @entity18 being jailed			0
in a speech in @entity20 , mr @entity2 played down the greed of politicians , suggesting they were simply being ‘ imaginative ’			1
‘ the blunt truth is that the expenses debacle was a particularly embarrassing layer of icing on an especially unappetising cake , ’ he told political charity the @entity24			1
‘ the reality in 2009 is that the @entity30 as a meaningful political institution … had been in decline for some decades			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity30 appeared to be little more than a cross between a rubber stamp and a talking shop which had taken to collective activity such as the imaginative interpretation of what might be a legitimate expense claim – as much as an odd form of displacement activity as out of any shared sense of malice or corruption			1
’ but last night sir @entity45 , former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , said mr @entity2 had ‘ got it totally wrong ’			2
‘ the expenses scandal looked to me like a deliberate attempt by @entity16 to overcome their grievances over their salaries by boosting their expenses , ’ he said			1
anti-sleaze : sir @entity45 , the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , said mr @entity2 had ' got it totally wrong ' ‘ they had been given quite improper nods and winks by former prime ministers who hinted that while it might not be politically possible to increase their pay , it was legitimate to maximise how much they claimed in expenses			2
‘ this created a very disturbing culture which is nothing to do with boredom but a way to bump up their pay			0
’ senior conservative mp @entity71 , who has described mr @entity2 as ‘ divisive and self - important ’ , said his comments showed he was out of touch			2
changes : mr @entity2 also suggested reforms to give backbenchers more power mr @entity71 , an aide for chancellor @entity78 , added : ‘ the expenses scandal had nothing to do with displacement activity and more to do with the fact that @entity10 was not open and transparent enough to the public			1
’ mr @entity2 suggested his moves to give backbenchers more powers had resulted in a ‘ @entity87 ’ – referring to the pro-democracy revolution in the @entity89			2
he credited his own reforms for giving life to the ‘ virtual corpse ’ of @entity10 , suggesting more family - friendly hours and allowing mps to quiz ministers at short notice were the most important changes			1
‘ far from being in the final twitches of our mortal life , the virtual corpse has staged an unexpected recovery , ’ he said			2
‘ it strikes me that three factors best explain the resuscitation of the @entity30 over these past three years			0
‘ they are procedural change , fresh blood and the novelty of coalition government			0
the first of these is probably , on balance , the most important			0
’ mr @entity2 also called for @entity114 to use online voting in elections and announced the creation of a speaker ’s commission on ‘ digital democracy ’ to help politicians and technology firms work together			1
he said the project was ‘ unpredictable , potentially anarchic ’ but denied he was ‘ stretching the nature of [ his ] office ’ by calling for political reforms			0
commons speaker @entity2 racked up nearly £ 100,000 in expenses in three years – despite a grace - and - favour residence by the @entity130			0
he charged £ 16,000 for chauffeur - driven official car journeys and ran up £ 63,000 on flights , including visits to almost 20 countries to lecture them on democracy			0
one of the car journeys was to the offices of the @entity16 ’ expenses watchdog – only one mile from @entity10			1
he claimed £ 84.31 for the round trip			0
his biggest expense was £ 11,252.81 for a return business class flight for himself and two staff to @entity142 , for the 2010 @entity143 ’ conference in @entity145			0
the huge sums are on top of £ 9,200 claimed by mr @entity2 in the past three years in his role as mp for @entity150			0
he visited @entity151 , the @entity152 and @entity153 at the invitation of their parliaments but @entity114 taxpayers picked up the bill .			0

speaker blamed the scandal on @entity6 being ' less meaningful '
he said politicians were not greedy , they were simply ‘ imaginative ’
claimed @entity10 *'s* role as ' *effective* *legislature* ' has been in decline for decades
