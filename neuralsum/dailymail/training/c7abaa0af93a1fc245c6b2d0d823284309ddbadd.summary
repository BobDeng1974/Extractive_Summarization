she 's famous for her impeccable sense of style and @entity5 's @entity4 @entity3 did n't disappoint as she joined forces with @entity7 for an audience at the @entity9			1
the royal couple were hosting a discussion on the regularisation of @entity5 train timetables as well as meeting charity bosses at the palace			1
but while the subject matter might have been dull , @entity3 's ensemble certainly was n't with her businesslike black trousers given a pop of cheerful colour with the help of a pretty cerise top			0
looking good : @entity3 was glamorous in a businesslike jacket and a pretty cerise top chic : she added a pop of colour to her otherwise sensible ensemble and chose her favourite purple the colour is one of the 42 - year - old 's favourites and she is often seen sporting it - or variations on it - at official events			1
one that she did n't wear purple for was monday 's @entity40 celebrations , which see parades take place up and down the country			0
known in @entity5 as @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades , the oldest of which takes place in @entity50			1
the biggest and most important , however , is @entity51 's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession			0
@entity7 was making his first appearance at an @entity40 parade since becoming king in june 2014 and follows a turbulent @entity60 period for the @entity5 royals			1
on the 20th december , it was announced that @entity7 's older sister @entity63 , 49 , would go on trial for tax crimes			2
important : the audience at the @entity9 in @entity51 included a discussion on train timetables pleased : the assembled dignitaries looked delighted to be included in a photo with the royal couple new rules : @entity7 hopes to regain the respect of the @entity5 people following a series of scandals royal salute : @entity5 's @entity7 and @entity4 @entity3 watch the traditional @entity40 parade glamorous : @entity3 began the new year in style and wore a floor - length teal dress for the occasion along with her husband , former handball player , @entity83 , the 49 - year - old princess is one of 17 people charged with misusing funds donated to mr @entity87 's charity , the @entity86			1
as a result , @entity63 has been asked to keep a low profile , has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at @entity7 's coronation			2
if convicted , which would be a first for @entity5 's royal family , she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine			2
while @entity7 and @entity3 remain popular , the incident has led to the introduction of new rules designed to prevent a repeat of both the current scandal and the last two to affect his family - king @entity103 ' love of a freebie and the infamous 2009 photo in which he was pictured standing over an elephant he had shot			0
the rules , which also apply to @entity3 and his two daughters , came into effect on @entity110 and are intended to avoid ' compromising the dignity of the institution '			0
along with banning freebies , royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an ' exemplary manner ' likely to ' earn citizens ' appreciation , respect and trust			0
' ceremony : after the parade , the couple returned to the @entity125 for more @entity40 celebrations royal welcome : guests included @entity129 , the military archbishop of @entity5 ( right ) turbulent : the @entity5 royals have endured a difficult @entity60 period thanks to @entity63 guests : a dignitary bows as he is introduced to 42 - year - old @entity4 @entity3 looking good : @entity3 looked fresh - faced and relaxed following the @entity60 break			0
