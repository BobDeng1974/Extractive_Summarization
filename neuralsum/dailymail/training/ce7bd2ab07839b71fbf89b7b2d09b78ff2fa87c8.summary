immigrants from outside @entity2 have taken £ 100billion more in benefits and services than they paid back in taxes , a major study revealed yesterday			1
over a 16 - year period , the bill to the taxpayer of providing them with welfare , health and education was 14 per cent higher than the money they put in the national purse			1

unemployed line up at a @entity21 : immigrants from outside @entity2 have taken £ 100billion more in benefits and services than they paid back in taxes , a major study revealed yesterday			1
( @entity26 image ) the report from academics at @entity29 claims to be the most far - reaching study yet conducted of the impact of migration on taxpayers			2
its findings were based on official figures , including those for public spending and tax receipts , and on the government ’s @entity40 that looks at the lives of around 150,000 families each year			2
professor @entity44 and dr @entity45 said that between 1995 and 2011 , migrants from @entity2 countries paid 4 per cent more into the tax system than they took out , while @entity50 - born people had on average paid in 7 per cent less than they received from the state			1
however , migrants from outside the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) – which is the 27 @entity58 countries plus @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 – had made a ‘ negative fiscal contribution ’ overall , ’ their report said			2
fresh influx : a banner promoting a firm in @entity66 , the @entity67 capital , recruiting for workers for jobs in @entity50 when borders open to @entity67 next year ‘ this is partly explained by their demographic structure – non-eea immigrants have had more children than natives , and we have allocated educational expenditure for children to immigrants			0
’ the analysis comes at a point of deepening controversy over the cost of health and benefit tourism and widespread anxiety over the potential impact of a new wave of migration from @entity67 and @entity91 in the new year			1
citizens of the two countries , which joined the @entity58 in 2007 , win the right to work freely in @entity50 from january			0
the @entity95 reported at the weekend that @entity50 firms are actively recruiting workers in @entity66 and that job agencies in @entity67 are already being asked how to claim state benefits in this country			0
@entity29 ’s report said the population of migrants from outside @entity2 grew by more than 2.2million between 1995 and 2011 , reaching just under 6.15million in 2011			1
it said that over the same period , the @entity105 immigrants received public services and benefits worth £ 104 billion more , at 2011 prices , than they paid in taxes			0
their contributions , the report said , paid just over 86 per cent of the value of the services and benefits they received			0
over the same period , the @entity56 migrant population went up from under two million to 2.85million in 2011			0
but they contributed £ 8.8billion more to the @entity117 than they received in services and benefits , meaning they paid 4 per cent more than they took			0
according to the data , migrants are 20 per cent more likely to be claiming work tax credit than @entity50			0
one in seven people claiming the benefit is a @entity127 national			0
the report does not break down differences between migrants from wealthy western @entity2 countries like @entity132 and @entity133 and those from poorer @entity2 nations			1
migrants from @entity137 and seven other @entity2 states gained the right to work freely in @entity50 in 2004			1
open door : @entity142 report said the population of migrants from outside @entity2 grew by more than 2.2million between 1995 and 2011 , reaching just under 6.15million in 2011 professor @entity44 and his colleagues said : ‘ immigrants arriving since the early 2000s have made substantial net contributions to public finances , a reality that contrasts starkly with the view often maintained in public debate			1
’ however their report said recent immigrants are likely to be of working age and so make fewer demands on schools or the @entity159			0
but sir @entity160 of the @entity161 think tank said : ‘ it is very interesting that this report finds that @entity166 migrants since 1995 have made a negative contribution to the national budget , yet they have accounted for two thirds of foreign immigration over the past 15 years			2
‘ as regards @entity58 migrants , much of the benefit stems from their relative youth but , like the rest of us , they will get older			2
no allowance has been made in these calculations for future pensions or for higher health costs in old age			0
’ dr @entity182 of the @entity183 at @entity184 said the research suggests the net contribution of recent migrants is positive – but some groups can ‘ represent a burden ’ .			2

major study tracks cost and contributions of migrants over 16 - year period
it finds migrants from outside @entity2 cost a lot more than they give back
but migrants from @entity201 and @entity202 are a net benefit to *exchequer*
