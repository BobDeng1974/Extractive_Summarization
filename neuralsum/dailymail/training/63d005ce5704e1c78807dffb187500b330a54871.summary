@entity0 probably did n’t have this in mind when they created the @entity3 - but @entity5 researchers are to use the games console for parts when they send it up into space			1
they hope that the @entity10 technology will allow the craft to ‘ see ’ another satellite they have are also planning to launch orbit and allow the two to dock			1
the team will also be putting a @entity17 phone inside which will serve as its on board computer			1
their craft is the @entity21 , or @entity22 and @entity23 , and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft the researchers are turning to the @entity3 because they are cheap to use and @entity0 has already done the hard part of creating the technology			2
their craft is the @entity21 , or @entity22 and @entity23 , and is an attempt to use everyday electronics in space craft			0
@entity31 is already completed and set for launch but both are smaller than a shoebox and cost hundreds of thousands of pounds , compared to millions for the full size version			0
they do not even have any rockets of their own so need to piggyback another craft to get into space			0
the @entity10 technology would work in the same way that it does for @entity3 games - by identifying players , or in this case another satellite , and tracking where they move			1
this would ensure they lock onto each other and dock smoothly , something which has not been tried with space ships as small as this			2
if it works , the technology could be used on bigger space craft and significantly bring down the cost of space travel			0
everyday electronics such as the @entity10 motion sensor from @entity3 will be used for the hi - tech docking procedure @entity61 project lead @entity59 said that he hoped the satellites could one day make ‘ grocery runs ’ for other vessels in orbit by bringing them new computers or spare batteries , or doing other routine maintenance			1
he said he was inspired by the autonomous model helicopter that had been created by the @entity71 and asked himself : ‘ why has no - one used this in space ? ’ he said : ‘ once you can launch low cost nanosatellites that dock together , the possibilities are endless - like space building blocks ’			0
@entity31 is due for launch later this year and @entity21 is currently under construction .			0

@entity3 motion sensor used to steer satellites together
*powered* by @entity17 *smartphone* as ' *onboard* computer '
will dock with another @entity5 satellite
