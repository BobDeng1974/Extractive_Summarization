by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 26 february 2013 a cow which thinks it â€™s a horse has become the unlikely star of a pony display team			1
the cute three - year - old cow called @entity5 was orphaned after her mother died giving birth			1
@entity5 , a @entity9 cow , was spared the chop and brought up surrounded by horses at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
( @entity29 ) stable girl @entity30 on @entity31 , @entity32 with @entity5 and @entity33 after all the recent confusion with horses being mistaken for cows , here is a cow that feels ' right at home ' being ridden and attached to a carriage like a horse			1
@entity5 now struts her stuff for @entity19 , a pony display team based in @entity21 - leaping over 2ft jumps			1
@entity45 , who runs @entity46 , the equine charity which trains the @entity47 , said @entity5 believes she is just another one of the ponies			2
she said : ' there 's no doubt she thinks she 's a horse			2
she 's been reared with the ponies for years now , so there 's no reason for her to think she 's a cow			2
@entity5 was orphaned as a newborn and brought up surrounded by horses in the north of @entity14 the people who care for @entity5 now say that there is no reason for her to beliebe she is a cow			1
@entity63 , @entity64 with @entity5 @entity5 enjoys cantering with @entity64 in his chariot ' of course it all seems a bit random as there 's no other cow in the world that does what she does right now , but it 's normal to her			1
' she lives in the same stables as the ponies and is very happy to have such close company with them			0
' it 's deserved as she had a tough start to life because her mother unfortunately died at birth			1
' she was hand - reared by the people from the reindeer centre but she was so tame they could n't put her back in the herd and they certainly were n't going to eat her			0
' so they simply turned up here one day with a big red ribbon round her neck and said " we thought you 'd like her "			0
' @entity5 sailed through an intensive training course and quickly began to conquer the large jumps that the @entity19 team leap			1
now taking parts in galas and agricultural shows , @entity5 has become a hit with fans all around @entity14			2
the cow jumps over two - foot - high obstacles to copy the ponies @entity100 was hand - reared at the @entity101 in @entity13 where she was too tame to be released back into the wild @entity5 with her friends @entity64 ( left ) and stable girl @entity5 on @entity31 ( right ) @entity45 said : ' she 's been absolutely amazing as she took to it like a duck to water but i have to admit , it 's hysterical watching her			1
' she 's got all the confidence in the world , whether it 's a few hundred people at a small gala or thousands at a big agricultural show she canters around no bother at all			0
' she has great determination			0
as soon as she sees the jump you can see her concentrating on the take off , completes the jump , slows down , goes round the corner , sees another jump , conquer that one and just keeps going and going			0
' the ponies will take about three foot and if @entity5 can get up to full speed she sometimes gets quite close to that			2
' the people watching are usually absolutely gob - smacked			0
you can hear the giggling and all the " awws " too as she comes round			0
' but she loves what she 's doing			0
she gets pampered just like the rest of the ponies and she wears a normal harness and a bridal too			0

@entity5 was brought up with horses when her mother died giving birth
the cow now thinks she is a horse and has *joined* a pony display team
the @entity21 based team said that she is one of their most popular performers
