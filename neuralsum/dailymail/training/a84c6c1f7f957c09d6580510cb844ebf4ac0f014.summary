by @entity0 it ’s unusual for @entity2 not to be leading the way when it comes to product design , but new reports claim when it comes to its @entity8 the firm is having to play catch up with @entity11			1
during a trip to @entity15 , a @entity13 tech analyst said an @entity2 supplier revealed a number of features of the much - rumoured device , including a rounded face and slim design			1
this would resemble how the @entity23 looks - and contradicts previous reports the watch would have a curved , or square screen			1
previous reports suggested it would have a curved , or square screen like the @entity35 and @entity38 's @entity37 range speculation around @entity2 's @entity8 began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013			1
@entity44 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity46 on a wrist - worn gadget			0
it was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use @entity50 to communicate with other devices , including an @entity52			0
other rumours suggest the @entity8 will feature @entity55 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			1
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity66 said @entity2 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity8			1
last month , an analyst said the device will come in ' his ' and ' hers ' models and cost ' thousands ' of dollars			0
if the rumours are true , @entity2 could announced the device at its annual september event			2
the reports were made by @entity28 from @entity77			2
according to his supply chain sources , the @entity8 will be designed to look like a traditional watch , and move away from the chunky , square look of the @entity35 and @entity38 ’s gear range			1
@entity11 announced its own plans for a round , @entity85 - powered smartwatch earlier this year and @entity28 's sources claim @entity2 ’s version will be almost identical , if not a little thinner			1
as @entity90 noted , @entity2 ’s icons have rounded edges and this would suit a circular face			2
@entity28 ’s source also confirmed previous rumours that the @entity8 would be available in ‘ his ’ and ‘ hers ’ models , and will go into production from july			1
the design is similar to concepts created by @entity101 from @entity102			0
@entity101 ’s concept incorporates the rumoured @entity105 fitness features that leaked in march , but experts believe @entity2 could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically designed to track health			0
@entity110 announcement comes just a week after sources revealed @entity15 's @entity112 will start mass production of @entity2 first smartwatch in july , and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in october			1
pictured is a concept design of what the @entity8 may look like by comparison , the @entity119 , pictured , has a square , 2 - inch display and runs @entity119 - a streamlined version of @entity110 's current operating system seen on phones and tablet			2
the @entity38 range of @entity37 devices similarly chose a square , rather than rounded design the @entity23 , pictured , is expected to launch at @entity110 's @entity130 in june , followed by the @entity8 in september earlier this week , during the unveiling of its latest g3 handset , @entity119 gave a sneak peek of its square @entity85 - powered @entity35			1
all three - the @entity23 , the @entity35 and the @entity8 - are expected to launch later this year			1
it ’s likely the @entity23 will be announced at @entity110 ’s @entity130 in june , and go on sale for £ 180 in july , followed by the @entity8 during @entity2 ’s annual september event			1
price-wise , an @entity2 @entity8 may follow the same pattern as @entity2 ’s handsets and sit at the top end of the market			2
reports last month even stated it could cost ‘ thousands ’ of dollars			0
although the smartwatches of @entity38 and @entity144 have n’t been as popular as analysts predicted , @entity28 said orders for the @entity8 are surpassing expectation and he forecasts 18 to 21 million @entity148 will be sold before @entity149			2
last night , @entity38 revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market			0
it also revealed an online service to track the data - just days before @entity2 is expected to reveal its ' @entity105 ' app for the @entity52			2
@entity38 presented its vision for wearable devices at a @entity161 event ahead of next week 's developers conference by rival @entity2			0
the new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the @entity8 would have a curved screen , as seen in this concept by @entity168 @entity171 , part of luxury goods group @entity173 , said on friday its vice president for sales , @entity169 , who had been with the brand for seven years , was leaving on monday to join @entity2 - and is expected to work on the @entity8			1
there is widespread speculation @entity2 has been working on wearable devices , and its products tend to use proprietary technologies			0
however , an open system would be a departure for @entity38 as well			0
its gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with @entity38 phones			0
smartwatches from @entity144 and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of @entity85 phones			0
last night , @entity38 revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market			0
@entity194 , vice president of @entity195 for @entity38 is pictured displaying the @entity196			0
