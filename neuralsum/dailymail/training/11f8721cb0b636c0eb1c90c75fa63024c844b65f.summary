that 's the predicament 19 - year - old @entity8 has found herself in less than a year after she brought her pet @entity10 home for the first time			1
to date the hyperactive 11 - month old has destroyed two laptops , a mobile phone and tv wires and eaten an entire arm chair - leaving her owner with a bill for more than £ 1,500			1
@entity8 from @entity19 with her @entity20 named pups a taste for upholstery : the hungry puppy has destroyed a £ 250 armchair , and shredded her owner 's sofa , right miss @entity29 has now been forced to drop out of her college course in hairdressing and beauty therapy , because she 's too scared to leave pups home alone			1
she said : ' she is absolutely crazy			2
' pups is the cutest thing ever when i 'm around but if i even leave the room she goes nuts			1
' she is hooked on anything electrical and literally eats my laptop			2
' once i lost loads of coursework i 'd saved on my laptop because pups ate straight through the back of it			1
' it was quite embarrassing because i had to go to college the next day and explain that my dog literally had eaten my homework			1
' i walk pups three times a day and feed her proper dog food but she 's got a fixation with my stuff			2
' she has destroyed my home			2
' i have had to fit two new kitchen cupboard doors			2
it has cost me an absolute fortune , at least £ 1,500			1
' pups managed to gnaw through a thick laptop computer damage : the @entity20 ca n't be left alone for more than 30 minutes without going on an wrecking rampage the frustrated pet owner even spent £ 140 on a dog whisperer to see if he could stop pups wrecking her home but he told her the pooch was beyond help			1
she said : " the whisperer said there was nothing he could do and that he has never seen a dog like it			0
he could not recommend any techniques			0
hopefully age will slow her down			0
' i just have to keep shouting at her and hope one day she will listen			0
