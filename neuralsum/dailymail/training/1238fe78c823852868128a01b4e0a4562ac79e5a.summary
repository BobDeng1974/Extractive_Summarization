@entity1 manager @entity0 has opened up about his management style , using the analogy of making a suit to measure to describe his role , whilst also suggesting being a coach in @entity7 is ‘ paradise ’			1
the @entity10 boss , since returning to @entity1 in the summer of 2013 , has assembled a star studded squad which is perched at the top of the @entity13 and in the last 16 of the @entity14			1
@entity0 , who has won league titles in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , insists you need to treat each player differently to harness their potential			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 talks to @entity23 about his reign at @entity25 ‘ to manage a player is like to make a suit by measure , because all of them are different i can not go to a shop and buy some 38 , some 40 , some 42 , some 44 and arrive in the dressing room			1
no. it has to be by measure , it has to be perfect , ’ @entity0 told @entity23			1
‘ so the personal relationship with the players is something very very important			2
obviously there is also the collective leadership and i have to try and adapt my collective leadership to the profile of group i have , ’ added the @entity10 boss			1
‘ but i think the suit by measure is the perfect way to explain what i think is fundamental – every man is a man , i read them and the better i can interact with them the better the team can be			2
’ @entity0 watches on as his new recruit @entity51 ( centre ) control the ball at @entity25 @entity0 told @entity54 @entity1 have been a success in the transfer market because they do n't panic @entity1 had a strong summer in the transfer market with the acquisitions of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 proving excellent additions and have propelled the @entity10 to the top of the @entity13			1
the 52 - year - old puts his transfer success down to composure and research : ‘ first of all we did n’t panic			0
i came here in the first season ( 2013 - 14 ) and we decided not to buy just because we want to win desperately , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ if we have to wait one year ok , to be more sure about the profile of the type of player we want to bring			0
we had to be very sure of what we wanted to do			0
‘ after that it ’s a lot easier not to make mistakes , analyse everything , try everything , know the players deeply , know if the players have the potential to improve or not under your guidance			0
@entity1 's midfielder @entity61 , a £ 30m summer signing , has been in fine form so far this season ‘ so when the summer market arrived we were in a great condition to make the right decisions to improve our team			1
@entity0 is clearly relishing life back in @entity93 despite disputes with officials and an apparent ‘ campaign ’ against his @entity1 side			1
‘ firstly it ’s paradise for the social life , in @entity102 the power of football made our lives complicated and in @entity7 people look at you in a normal way			0
you can walk in the street , shop with your family , go to a restaurant , ’ said the @entity16			0
