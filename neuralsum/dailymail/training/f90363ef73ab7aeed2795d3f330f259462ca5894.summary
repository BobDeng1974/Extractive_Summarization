@entity1 , 28 , used y - front underpants to clean the premises at @entity4 in @entity5 - which had just one ' very dirty ' sink for washing hands			1
@entity15 heard the brand - new white underclothes were still at the site after it had previously been used as a clothing supplier			2
chicken from @entity4 was sold to 60 businesses , including takeaway restaurants , kebab shops and supermarkets in the city and as far afield as @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
but married father - of - two @entity1 ’s processing plant on the @entity29 , @entity5 , had none of the necessary food hygiene approvals or licences to work with meat			1
environmental health officers from @entity36 raided the unmarked site on the @entity29 after a customer at @entity39 , also in @entity5 , found metal wire in a piece of chicken in may 2011			1
they found a band saw with meat residue around it , toilets opening straight on to the only washing area - and brand new pairs of underpants being used as cleaning cloths			1
there were also open wheelie bins containing meat debris and bones			2
mobile phones and receipts seized in the raid showed the meat was being distributed across the south west to what were described in court as ‘ @entity64 clones and kebab shops ’			2
pants hygiene standards : the court heard that the y - fronts , pictured , were ' all new and all clean ' but photos of them had turned father - of - two @entity1 , 28 , into ' a laughing stock '			1
his firm is now in liquidation @entity36 successfully applied for an order from magistrates to destroy more than four tonnes of chicken seized in a raid on the unit in may 2011			2

the @entity90 resident was also made to complete 200 hours of unpaid work			1
but only a fraction of the £ 2,002,672 turned over by the firm will be paid back , as @entity15 heard @entity1 's current assets are just £ 51,703			1
that sum must be repaid within six months			0
the judge said : ' anybody who looks at the photographs will be enormously dismayed by what they see			0
the premises are deplorably dirty , they are not fit for meat production , cutting or otherwise			2
' the floors are filthy			0
there ’s no hot water			0
the opportunity for those working there to wash their hands or equipment was one very dirty sink unit			0
' the public have a right to expect that those who deal with food in the way that you did are authorised and producing their food in a sanitary way			0
' the dangers to public health by what you did are very evident			0
' @entity126 , prosecuting , said : ' photographs show cleaning cloths , which were in fact underpants			0
' it transpired that the previous occupant of the premises had been a supplier of clothing			0
it appears these were items left at the premises and subsequently used for cleaning purposes			0
' four tonnes of chicken and beef were seized from the premises and @entity1 was arrested , mr @entity126 said			2
the court heard the business later re-opened as a cold store and operated legally , but was closed in 2012 by @entity1			2
@entity143 , defending , said : ' the chicken itself was sold from reputable suppliers			0
this was a bona fide product			0
' the product itself was then sold at market rate to regulated restaurants			0
' the chicken was sent to more than 60 outlets across @entity5 and as far afield as @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
the firm was shopped after a customer found metal wire in a kebab shop takeaway filthy : @entity4 in @entity5 , from which the chicken was distributed around the south west he said publicity from previous hearings had a ' devastating effect ' on @entity1 and made him a ' laughing stock ' due to the y - front rags being used to clean the site			1
' the underpants were all new , all clean and they were used as rags , ' mr @entity143 explained			0
he added @entity1 had two children , aged four and two , and helped his wife who had “ very poor ” @entity173			2
@entity1 had told a previous hearing that he had stepped in at short notice to help his family , saying the chicken arrived in boxes from @entity180 - regulated factories and was left in those boxes			1
however , he later admitted eight charges of failing to comply with food hygiene regulations , between june 2010 and may 2011			1
co-defendant @entity4 , which is in the process of liquidation and of which @entity1 is the sole director and shareholder , also pleaded guilty to the same eight charges			1
speaking after the case , @entity189 , principal environmental health officer at @entity36 , said : ' when we looked at his invoice books , we found distribution from @entity194 in west @entity195 , right along the @entity196 down to @entity197 , @entity198 , the @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity5 , @entity202 , @entity25 and @entity203			1
' ' it was a huge area - a total of 60 businesses who were being supplied by this company			0
