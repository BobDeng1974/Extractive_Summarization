the number of ‘ super-commuter ’ @entity1 who take 90 minutes to get to work has soared by 50 per cent in the last five years , according to a new report			1
the study shows the average @entity1 worker spends 41 minutes commuting every day			0
but the number spending a total of three hours or more travelling has risen to 1.84million - or nine per cent of the workforce			0
according to the results , accountants have the longest average daily commute – 75.6 minutes – followed by it workers at 65.6 minutes			1
the number of @entity1 spending at least three hours a day on their work commute has risen by 50 per cent by contrast , people working in the car industry only travel for an average of 22 minutes			1
they are followed by retailers ( 31.8 minutes ) , leisure workers ( 32.3 minutes ) , estate agents ( 36.4 minutes ) and teachers ( 36.9 minutes )			2
employees working in the leisure industry have the shortest distance to travel , an average of 12.6 miles , compared to it workers with a 38.5 - mile journey			2
the report , by recruitment firm @entity28 , found that the car is @entity1 ’s most popular method of transport to and from the office – accounting for more than half of work - related journeys			1
and around one in ten people will take the train , but only one in 40 cycles to work			0
@entity39 , the @entity1 chief executive of @entity28 , said : ‘ the central tenet of the commuting life is that you travel away from the workplace			1
‘ you do this until you reach an area where you can afford to buy a house that meets your standards			0
in this equation you ’re essentially trading miles for square feet			1
the car is still the most popular method of getting to work , accounting for half of all journeys ‘ three hours is no longer extraordinary			0
commuters travel across counties the way that they used to travel across neighbourhoods			0
’ and despite the tough economic conditions , @entity1 commuters are only spending marginally less time ( 2.3 % ) on the move than they were before the downturn began to take hold			0
for back in 2008 , the average @entity1 commute took a total of 42 minutes each day			2
the average total daily commuting distance has dropped from 18.5 miles in 2008 to 16.7 miles - a fall of 10 per cent - as people live slightly closer to their workplaces			1
but the report notes : ‘ the fact commuting times have remained broadly the same suggests commuters are managing their commutes and using slower - possibly cheaper - modes of transport than they were before the downturn			0

almost *2million* @entity1 spend three hours or more on their daily commute
accountants spend longest travelling to work and leisure workers shortest
*experts* say housing costs drive people to live further away from work
@entity39 from @entity28 said workers are ' trading miles for square feet '
