for most parents a set of @entity1 , a solid climbing frame and well - stocked bookcase would be considered a satisfactory selection of facilities at their child 's nursery , but for parents in @entity12 's @entity11 , it 's more than their child 's developmental needs that are being met			1
at the newly opened @entity17 , you can drop off your laundry alongside your child in the morning and pick it up ready folded when you come to fetch an expertly - stimulated and ( presumably perfectly laundered ) child at the end of the day			1
and there 's no stressing about what to make for supper			0
the nursery will also provide a freshly - cooked meal for the whole family , complete with starter and pudding			1
a new nursery in @entity11 aims to take the stress out of the day for working mums by offering gym classes , laundry services and take - away family suppers what more could you ask for ? how about a choice of yoga , pilates or boxercise classes so you do n't have to rush off to the gym , a selection of tea , coffee and pastries to send you off on your morning commute and it facilities including computers , ipads and printers at your fingertips ? it 's all provided at @entity53 - for a little extra cost , of course			1
on top of the £ 80 day rate for children , the adult supplement costs £ 100 a month , which buys you as many pastries as you can eat , free use of the it facilities in the ' parent hubb ' and four vouchers for the laundry , meal or exercise services			1
of course , your children wo n't do badly either			0
the nursery has an outdoor beach and tree - house , a fully - equipped mini kitchen and art studio			2
' we had a number of meetings with local parents before opening to find out how we could make their life easier and these were some of the aspects that were mentioned , ' explains the nursery 's manager @entity83 to the @entity85			1
' parents feel they 're constantly going backwards and forwards so we 're trying to reduce their need to rush about , ' he adds			0
the ' parent hub ' at @entity17 ( above ) includes a kitchen , stocked with tea , coffee and pastries as well as an it suite with computers , @entity96 and printing facilities the outdoor space at the five - star @entity17 allows children to explore their surroundings considering that a recent study found that the school or nursery drop - off and cooking dinner for the family were the two most stressful parts of the day , perhaps @entity108 is onto something			1
the survey , which was commissioned to mark october 's walk to @entity112 also found that 83 per cent of parents ' ca n't cope ' juggling drop - offs with getting to work on time			2
so a little help with the chores , which are often squeezed in before and after drop - off , would no doubt de-stress the day for many a working working mother			2
but it 's not always that simple its it ? what about the parents who ca n't afford to spend £ 25 a pop on laundering their dirty underpants ? @entity126 , chief executive of family and @entity128 says more needs to be done for families who are n't on a posh budget			1
children at the @entity17 can experience real cooking in the mini kitchen not just a pot of paint for these lucky tots : the fully - equipped art studio ( above ) ' far too many parents are unable to access childcare that meets their needs , ' @entity126 tells the @entity85			1
' where childcare is available , it is often at a high cost to parents , with parents in @entity146 paying a higher proportion of their salary on childcare than all other @entity151 countries except @entity152			0
' bold reforms are needed if we are going to achieve high quality childcare that is affordable and truly meets the needs of modern families , ' he adds			0
pilates for stressed parents may not be top of the government 's proprieties but nurseries that provide auxiliary services for working mothers and reforms that provide more flexibility in the work place could be			1
but downward dogs and puff pastries aside could ideas like @entity108 's ' parent hub ' concept also tackle what has been dubbed the ' ghost children ' phenomena			1
earlier this year the @entity176 warned that a generation of children as young as four are stuck in a nursery or school environment for up to ten hours a day without parental touch			0
@entity83 hopes the nursery can go someway to help parents spend more time with their children			2
' the idea is that parents can tap in and tap out of work all on our premises			0
freelancers use the it suite as their office and quite often parents who work in an office use it for conference calls that have to be scheduled at times that coincide with pick up or drop off , which means they can leave the office earlier , ' he explains			2
however the nursery does not encourage parents to make their presence known once they 've kissed their little ones goodbye as it can be ' unsettling for the child '			2
but @entity83 says the extra facilities mean parents who freelance or work from home can use the nursery as their office , cutting out journey times and shortening the hours away from their child			2
educational psychologist @entity216 believes parental presence in the nursery could be beneficial for the children in many ways			0
' anything that encourages parents and carers to work in collaboration and helps communication between the two is good for the children , ' she says			0
the nursery is hoping to cater to parents ' needs as well as children 's the slick entrance to @entity17 : by creating more facilities for parents on site , they hope parents will be able to spend more time with their children ' creating that link between home and nursery can be very useful in managing any difficulties a child might be facing and sharing experiences between parents and carers can have positive affects on their development , ' she adds			1
' i can also see the appeal for parents			0
it could feel quite comforting knowing your child is just downstairs - especially if they are young			0
' but @entity216 agrees that knowing parents are working upstairs could be unsettling for the children			0
' it depends on the child , but it could make it harder for children to settle knowing their parents are right there			0
part of the experience for children is learning to separate from a parent and understanding that when they say goodbye to you in the morning , you will still come back to collect them at the end of the day			0
' for £ 100 a month parents have four vouchers to use on the following : also included iare as many pastries as you can eat and use of the it facilities in the ' parent hub '			1

@entity17 in @entity12 offers services to help working parents
extras include a laundry service and family meal take - away
the nursery 's ' parent hub ' , has it suite and a kitchen stocked with pastries
yoga , pilates and boxercise classes also on offer
the adult supplement costs £ 100 a month for use of ' parent hub ' and four extra services
