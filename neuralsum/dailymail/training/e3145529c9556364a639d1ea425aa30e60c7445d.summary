’ asked why he did n’t notice it was a person lying in the ground , he said : ‘ she was dressed all in black lying flat on the road with her face on the opposite side and it was very , very dark			2

i can remember us singing and dancing , badly , but having fun			0
it seemed like she was having a great night , we all were			1
‘ that night we were mixing shots with cocktails			1
@entity6 had also told me that she had not eaten and had been out with work for a drink before meeting us			1
’ miss @entity6 - who was studying planning and property development @entity133 after leaving @entity135 in @entity136 - had ‘ very high ’ levels of alcohol in her body			1
investigating : miss @entity6 - who was studying planning and property development @entity133 after leaving @entity135 in @entity136 - had ' very high ' levels of alcohol in her body alcohol : the coroner raised concerns that @entity10 nightclub ( file picture ) in @entity12 served such strong cocktails and later let miss @entity6 stagger away without her bag she had been working at chartered surveyors firm @entity150 , based in @entity151 , at the time of her death			1

' i remember thinking it was nothing , it was pitch dark			0

’ the student loved swimming , tennis , and had been one of the best football players at her school			1
she had been working in @entity12 on a year ’s placement when she was hit by the cars last winter , and had been planning a trip to @entity193			2
coroner dr @entity194 said : ‘ it is my understanding that the first vehicle was driven by @entity28			2
‘ the main impact between @entity6 and the car was on the wing mirror and her body went down the side of the vehicle before she hit the floor			1
when she was on the floor the second vehicle went over her			2
’ reasons : the coroner blamed the death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting , and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on the historic mall miss @entity6 had downed shots , drunk wine and cocktails and shared a ‘ @entity222 ’ cocktail , containing nearly two bottles of rum , at the club with two friends in the hours before her death			1
towards the end of the night she went outside into the smoking area to try to find her friend , but was not let back in by bouncers , and so left alone and without her handbag or purse and staggered off in the direction of @entity13			0
' had @entity6 not been intoxicated with alcohol she would n't have been staggering around the @entity13			1
it may be that this death would have been entirely avoided ' coroner dr @entity194 today dr @entity194 blamed her death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting , and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on @entity13			2
she said : ‘ had @entity6 not been intoxicated with alcohol she would n't have been staggering around the @entity13			1
it may be that this death would have been entirely avoided			0
‘ the low lighting in this area contributed to this incident , i 'm sure , as it prevented mr @entity28 from seeing her in time to avoid the incident			2
‘ and the low lighting on the balance of probabilities stopped mr @entity69 from identifying what was in front of him			0
‘ the lighting was too poor for mr @entity69 at that point to have taken any reasonable action to have avoided @entity6 's body			1
’ concerns : in the 36 months until august 2012 there were 28 collisions around @entity13 , leading to two deaths			0
in both of these cases poor lighting was one of the factors blamed she added : ‘ the lighting is poor , compounding that there is a considerable amount of street furniture , flag poles , trees and a lot of things that can obstruct the view			0
’ coroner dr @entity194 also raised concerns that @entity10 nightclub in @entity12 served such strong cocktails and later let miss @entity6 stagger away without her bag			1
she said ‘ one would see it 's pretty obvious problems would arise ’ after selling cocktails with two bottles of rum in it			2
she added : ‘ i ca n't speculate because i do n't know why she was n't let back into the club to collect her bag			0
i do n't know if she asked			0
‘ it is clear a minicab was n't called for her despite her inebriated state which appears to be against the policy of @entity10			1
but we have no idea what the conversation was			0
’ she said neither of the drivers would have a realistic opportunity of seeing @entity56 and avoiding her			0
delivering a verdict of accidental death , dr @entity194 added : ‘ i find it incredibly sad that a young woman of such enormous potential has lost her life from a culmination of too much alcohol and poor lighting			0
‘ i will consider this outside court but i 'm almost certainly going to write a report in relation to whether the street furniture and lighting on the @entity13 should be reviewed			0
‘ there have now been two fatalities close by and poor lighting has been indicates as a factor in each			0
‘ i 'm sure that miss @entity6 's family and all the officers and @entity322 crews would like me to make a report in these circumstances			1
’ in the 36 months until august 2012 there were 28 collisions around @entity13 , leading to two deaths			0
