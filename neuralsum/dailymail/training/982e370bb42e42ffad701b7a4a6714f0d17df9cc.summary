by @entity0 current rules , introduced in 2008 , say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks shoplifters who ruin small businesses or upset shop staff should be given much tougher punishments , judges and magistrates have been told			1
sentencing advisers yesterday called for jail terms for regular offenders who take goods worth only a few pounds			2
courts should also get tougher with thieves whose crime upsets or distresses small - business owners or staff responsible for running branches of large chains , they said			1
new guidelines on how to deal with thieves also call for stiff new sentencing for those who damage war memorials or put the public in danger by stealing metal			2
the demand for more serious sentencing follows complaints from business leaders that theft from stores has been treated as a misdemeanour rather than a crime that can smash small businesses and devastate their staff			1
senior judges have also said police are too readily letting hardened regular offenders get away with minor on - the - spot fines , which regularly go unpaid			0
but in 2012 a cabinet minister said that people who put their rubbish bins out an hour too early should get the same £ 80 fine as a shoplifter			0
rules that apply the same fines to shoplifting and breaking council bin rules remain in force			2
the new draft guidelines from the @entity55 – the judge - dominated body that advises courts on how to punish criminals – said courts should ‘ recognise the impact that shop thefts can have ’			1
the new sentencing rules – likely to be in operation by the end of the year – ‘ emphasise not only loss of business but also take into account that the size or type of business can make the shop owner particularly hard hit by thieves ’			1
new draft guidelines by the @entity55 said courts should ' recognise the impact that shop thefts can have ' and said harsher punishments should be given to shoplifters ( file picture ) current rules , introduced in 2008 , say courts should send a shoplifter to jail for no more than six weeks , and only for a crime involving violence , very high levels of planning , and significant threats or damage			1
lesser shoplifting offences attract fines or community punishments			2
the new rules recommend six months in prison for those who steal goods worth around £ 500 , if they harm a business or upset a shop worker , and even tougher terms for persistent offenders			1
as an example , the @entity55 said a regular thief who uses a foil - lined bag to steal a dvd box set worth £ 25 from a supermarket should get three months in jail , even after the court has reduced the punishment for his guilty plea			1
@entity109 , of the @entity110 , welcomes the new draft guidelines for the first time the rules cover bicycle theft			2
thieves who take machines worth around £ 250 should go to prison if they cause great inconvenience or leave the victim feeling intimidated , the guidelines say			0
@entity121 aking metal plaques from a war memorial or crematorium would be punished as ‘ heritage ’ theft			0
the distress to families and the cost of replacing the plaques should mean the culprit is jailed for between one and four years , the guidelines say			0
those who take manhole covers , roof tiles or electric cables would risk strong penalties because of the dangers and inconvenience they cause the public			0
@entity109 of the @entity110 welcomed the new rules			0
she said : ‘ theft from stores pushed the direct cost of retail crime up to £ 511million last year , with the average cost of each theft rising by 62 per cent to £ 177			0
' ‘ we all pay for this increased stealing through higher prices and , increasingly , shop closures and damage to our town centres			0

shoplifters should be given much tougher punishments , courts told
@entity55 said courts should ' recognise impact ' caused by thefts
current rules say shoplifters should not be jailed for more than six weeks
demand for *stricter* sentencing follows complaints from business leaders
new sentencing rules are likely to be in operation by the end of the year
