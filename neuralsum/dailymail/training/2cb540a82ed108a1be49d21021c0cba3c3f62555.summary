suspected @entity2 war criminals were quietly paid millions by @entity4 taxpayers to leave the country without putting up a fight , an investigation has revealed			1
dozens of people , including members of @entity11 's @entity10 who guarded death camps where millions of @entity13 were slaughtered , were handed the cash in exchange for leaving the country and giving up citizenship			1
a scientist who used slave labor to invent the @entity2 's v - 2 missile was also caught up in the so - called ' @entity2 dumping ' strategy which saw at least 38 people linked to @entity11 's murderous regime leave the @entity4 since 1979			1
four living people are still receiving monthly checks from the @entity4 government valued at around $ 1,500			1
over a lifetime total payments could easily have reached $ 375,000 per person			0
@entity32 lives in @entity38 now , while @entity33 is in @entity39 death camp : some of those the @entity4 paid - and continues to pay - after they left the @entity4 and renounced citizenship , were involved with the infamous @entity34 death camp in @entity45 , where hundreds of thousands of @entity13 were systemically slaughtered the practice was uncovered by a lengthy investigation by the @entity48 , which found how successive @entity4 administrations used the promise of state cash to speed up the removal of suspected criminals			1
the loophole allowed officials to avoid lengthy and expensive deportation hearings , which could drag on for as long as a decade before the suspect had to leave - and ran the risk of failing completely			2
but governments , usually of @entity61 nations who were lumbered with the suspects after they renounced @entity4 citizenship , objected strenuously to the process , prompting diplomatic backlashes			1
the payments , underwritten by @entity4 taxpayers , flowed through a legal loophole that gave the @entity71 leverage to persuade @entity2 suspects to leave the @entity4			1
until their deaths : two other suspected war criminals - rocket scientists @entity76 ( left ) and @entity10 guard @entity77 ( right ) , left the @entity4 and continued to receive @entity78 until their deaths - in 1996 and 1989 respectively if they agreed to go , or simply fled before deportation , they could keep their @entity78 , according to interviews and internal @entity4 government records			1
there are at least four living beneficiaries			0
they include @entity32 , a former @entity10 guard at the @entity87 camp in @entity88 , and @entity33 , who patrolled the grounds at @entity34			1
@entity32 moved to @entity38 in 2007 from @entity90 just before being stripped of his @entity4 citizenship			1
@entity33 fled to @entity88 from @entity92 in 1989 after learning denaturalization proceedings against him were underway			2
he soon resettled in @entity39 and now lives in a spacious apartment on the right bank of the @entity96 in @entity97			0
@entity33 refused to discuss the situation when questioned			0
his son , who lives in the @entity4 , confirmed his father receives @entity78 payments and said he deserved them			1
the other two known living beneficiaries are @entity104 , 90 , a former guard at the @entity106 camp in @entity107 , @entity108 , 93 , who served in the @entity10 still taking the cash : @entity33 , pictured in his @entity39 home earlier this year , refused to answer questions about the financial arrangements @entity114 lives in a nursing home in worms , @entity88 , while @entity117 , whose @entity119 unit took part in the destruction of the @entity13 ghetto in @entity123 , is believed to be living in @entity124			1
the deals allowed the @entity71 's former nazi - hunting unit , the @entity127 , to skirt lengthy deportation hearings and increased the number of @entity130 expelled from the @entity4 but newly - unearthed government records reveal heated objections from the @entity133 to @entity127 's practices			1
@entity78 benefits became tools , @entity4 diplomatic officials said , to secure agreements in which @entity2 suspects would accept the loss of citizenship and voluntarily leave the @entity4			1
' it 's absolutely outrageous that @entity2 war criminals are continuing to receive @entity78 benefits when they have been outlawed from our country for many , many , many years , ' said @entity146 , a @entity147 congresswoman and member of the @entity149			1
she said she now plans to introduce legislation to close the loophole			0
since 1979 , the new investigation found , at least 38 of 66 suspects removed from the country kept their @entity78 benefits			2
overseeing persecution : according to internal documents , the government departments involved in ridding the @entity4 of @entity130 saw striking the @entity78 deal as preferable to drawn - out deportation battles in court the @entity162 expressed outrage in 1997 over the use of benefits , the documents show , and blowback in foreign capitals reverberated at the highest levels of government			1
@entity171 authorities were furious upon learning after the fact about a deal made with @entity77 , a former @entity10 guard at the @entity175 concentration camp in @entity171			0
in 1987 , @entity77 landed unannounced at @entity177 's airport			0
two days later , under the terms of the deal , his @entity4 citizenship was revoked			2
the @entity181 - born @entity77 , who had emigrated to the @entity4 in 1955 , was suddenly stateless and @entity171 's problem			2
@entity77 continued to receive @entity78 benefits until he died in 1989			1
' it was not upfront , it was not transparent , it was not a legitimate process , ' said @entity188 , an assistant legal adviser at the @entity133 from 1982 until 2007			0
' this was not the way @entity4 should behave			0
we should not be dumping our refuse , for lack of a better word , on friendly states			0
' @entity196 , a former @entity127 director , said the @entity133 cared more about diplomatic niceties than holding former members of @entity11 's war machine accountable			0
amid the objections , the practice known as ' @entity2 dumping ' stopped			0
but the benefits loophole was n't closed , allowing all the recipients to keep on claiming			0
' war criminals ' : pictured above as @entity2 officers talking to @entity13 in the @entity207 - many of whom were brutally killed			2
a living @entity78 recipient - @entity108 , 93 - was part of the unit that killed them @entity71 spokesman @entity214 said in an emailed statement that @entity78 payments never were employed to persuade @entity2 suspects to depart voluntarily			1
the @entity162 refused the @entity48 's request for the total number of @entity2 suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of those payments			2
spokesman @entity223 said the agency does not track data specific to @entity2 cases			0
a further barrier , @entity223 said , is that there is no exception in @entity4 privacy law that ' allows us to disclose information because the individual is a @entity2 war criminal or an accused @entity2 war criminal			2
' the department also declined to make the acting commissioner , @entity238 , or another senior agency official available for an interview			0
rabbi @entity241 , the founder and head of the @entity243 in @entity244 , said the loophole should be closed			0
' someone receiving an @entity4 pension could live very well in @entity61 or wherever they settled , ' @entity241 said			2
' we , in effect , were rewarding them			0
it did n't make any sense			0

suspects including @entity10 guards and @entity2 scientists got government *payouts*
continued to receive @entity78 as deals to get them to leave @entity4
agencies in charge of *purging* nazis preferred the *tactic* to long court battles
after leaving , @entity4 suspects lost their citizenship - but kept payments
so - called ' @entity272 ' caused fury in nations *saddled* with @entity130
four men - @entity33 , @entity32 , @entity104 and @entity108 - are still receiving @entity78 payments today
