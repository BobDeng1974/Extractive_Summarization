by @entity0 swathes of @entity3 could be left totally underwater by a tsunami in the @entity5 , it has been claimed			1
an earthquake off @entity8 could trigger disastrous levels of flooding along the coast of the @entity3 , scientists have said			1
the @entity12 and parts of @entity14 would be worst hit if there were a repeat of the @entity18 earthquake of 1755			1
the @entity12 , which include @entity19 , pictured , lie 45 miles off the coast of @entity14 , coulde be wiped out by a tsunami if @entity8 suffered another devastating earthquake experts believe that a quake similar to the devastating one 250 years ago would send a 10ft wall of water towards the @entity3			1
the tsunami would crash over the tip of @entity14 within a few hours – leaving much of the coast underwater and wiping the tiny @entity12 off the map			1
the prospect of the natural disaster was raised at a meeting of the @entity34 and @entity35 , which includes police , town planners and emergency services			1
members of the @entity40 told the meeting they fear @entity3 could suffer its own version of the @entity43			2
they want an early warning system to alert bathers and people living on the coast , similar to technology used across @entity49 and @entity50			1
@entity51 's is one of the five inhabited @entity12 - plus dozens of islets - with a total population of around 2,100 @entity55 , assistant chief constable of @entity34 and @entity56 and @entity40 chairman , said other countries have suffered by failing to plan ahead			2
he told the forum : ‘ after seeing the devastation in @entity62 and @entity63 we have to ask the question of the scientific community – what and where would be the impact , is it likely and , if it is , should we plan for it ? a lot of areas would cope but in others it would cause a big problem			0
we have to consider whether we do anything differently than we do now for severe weather events			0
‘ @entity43 are different – you do n’t know they are coming and the water keeps coming and coming			0
’ @entity3 was last hit by a tsunami in 1755 , the year of the great @entity18 earthquake , the meeting in @entity79 was told			1
in the event of an earthquake in the @entity5 , the public would currently rely on the @entity85 to register the quake and the arrival of a subsequent wave at nearby @entity8			0
@entity89 , @entity40 coordinator in @entity34 and @entity14 , said : ‘ the @entity12 could be affected greatly , the islands could be covered and disappear			1
’ quake zone : @entity18 was ripped open by the 1755 earthquake which left fissures 15 feet wide in the city centre the 1755 @entity18 earthquake almost totally destroyed @entity18 and adjoining areas and had a magnitude in the range of 8.5 on the @entity99			1
under the @entity100 of 2004 , the @entity3 maintains a @entity101			2
the very high risk table is currently topped by pandemic flu , terrorist attacks and coastal flooding , though the last major civil flooding emergency was on the east coast in 1953			0
mr @entity89 says a tsunami is in the top 20 of the second category of high risks			0
other uniquely regional threats include a nuclear submarine incident at @entity113 and possible contamination from old tin mines in @entity14			2
work has also already been done to predict the catastrophic impact should a massive slab of rock twice the volume of the @entity121 break away from the island of @entity123 , in the @entity124 , and smash into the @entity5			0
the resulting tsunami , higher than @entity126 and faster than a jet aircraft , would devastate the eastern seaboard of @entity50 and inundate much of southern @entity3			2
the 1755 @entity18 earthquake , also known as the @entity130 , occurred on saturday , november 1 , 1755			1
the earthquake , which had its epicentre around 200 miles south - west of @entity133 on the @entity8 coast , almost totally destroyed @entity18 and had a magnitude in the range of 8.5 on the @entity99			1
it struck in the morning and lasted between three and six minutes , leaving vast cracks 15ft wide in the city centre streets			0
an engraving by @entity141 from @entity142 shows how @entity18 was destroyed in the earthquake of 1755 around 40 minutes later , a vast tsunami engulfed the city 's docks and centre , followed by two more waves			1
estimates place the death toll in @entity18 alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people , making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history			0
but its devastating impact was not only felt in @entity8 - it travelled more than a 1,000 miles before crashing into the @entity156			0
at around 2pm on the same day , a wave reported to be between three to four metres in height hit the shores of @entity14 , smashing into @entity160 , the area 's highest point , where it killed at least one person			0
estimates suggest that the death toll in @entity18 reached between 10,000 and 100,000 people , making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history the waves ( there were two more ) also struck the south coast and were even seen in the @entity170 in @entity171			2
the tsunami even reached as far as @entity173 in @entity174 , where it was described as being two metres high			0
@entity177 writer @entity176 claimed the wave caused a ' great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of @entity14 '			2
recent studies show that should another earthquake of the same magnitude happen , it could affect the south west of @entity187			0
a wave would take approximately five hours to travel to @entity3 , with maximum water heights reaching one to two metres around the vast coast of @entity14			1
but it would peak at around four metres ( 13ft ) in @entity160 .			0

disaster planners say a repeat of the 1755 great @entity18 quake is overdue
such a quake would wipe out *scillies* and much of the coast of @entity14
@entity34 and @entity35 wants warning system for @entity3
their concerns will be examined by *government* scientists and experts
