by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 15:11 est , 9 march 2013 @entity1 has pledged to scrap the @entity2 if the @entity3 win the next election a @entity3 government will scrap the @entity2 if they win they next general election , the home secretary has said			1
speaking in front of @entity3 activists , @entity1 said the party could go even further by pulling out of @entity12 obligations on rights altogether			1
she said the party must ' consider very carefully our relationship ' with the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , suggesting it was restricting @entity19 's ability to act in the national interest			1
she pointed to the case of radical preacher @entity22 , who was today ordered to remain in custody following his arrest for allegedly breaching his bail conditions , accusing @entity26 of constantly moving the goalposts on his deportation			2
ms may , who is being touted as a possible future @entity3 leader , told the @entity33 2015 conference staged by website conservativehome , that @entity19 must stop human rights laws interfering with its ability to protect the nation			1
the confirmation comes after speculation last week that the cabinet minister wanted to pull the @entity19 out of the @entity17			2
ms may said today : ' we need to stop human rights legislation interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration			1
' that 's why , as our last manifesto promised , the next @entity3 government will scrap the @entity2 , and it 's why we should also consider very carefully our relationship with the @entity17 and the convention it enforces			1
' when @entity26 constantly moves the goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like @entity22 , we have to ask ourselves to what end are we signatories to the convention ? ' are we really limiting human rights abuses in other countries ? i 'm sceptical			0
but are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest ? are we conceding that our own @entity62 is not supreme ? ' i believe we are			0
so by 2015 we 'll need a plan for dealing with the @entity17			0
and yes , i want to be clear that all options - including leaving the convention altogether - should be on the table			2
' mrs may said the case of hate preacher @entity22 , who was denied bail at his latest hearing today , highlighted the need for @entity19 to change its human rights laws ms may also told @entity3 grassroots at the @entity77 conference that she expects the @entity3 's public sector reform agenda to ' become even more radical ' and could include allowing companies to make a profit delivering frontline services			1
the wide - ranging speech , which also touched on industrial revival and banking , is likely to be viewed as a marker of intent by the home secretary about possible future leadership ambitions			1
more private companies and charities should be brought in to run public services to improve quality and end the ' monopoly ' of the state , which is too often a ' poor provider ' , ms may said			0
she added : ' in future , i expect our reform agenda to become even more radical			0
yes , the state should make sure that public services are available to all and free at the point of use			0
' yes , the state should regulate those services to make sure they 're provided everywhere and offer high standards			0
but too often the state is a poor provider of services , and its monopoly over the delivery of those services must end			0
' a future @entity3 government should therefore go further in increasing the number of charities , companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services			2
and if allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes , then that is something we should consider with an open mind			0

home secretary was speaking at a @entity3 conference today
@entity135 legislation restricts @entity19 's ability ' to fight crime and control immigration '
could go further and *withdraw* from @entity12 obligations on rights entirely
' all options on the table ' if conservatives win election in 2015
