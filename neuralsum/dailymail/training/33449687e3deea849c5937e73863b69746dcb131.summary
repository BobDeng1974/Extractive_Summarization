young people will struggle to find work unless employers are willing to offer them work experience , @entity0 warns today			1
the employment minister urged firms to follow the example of the tv show @entity8 , where aspiring bosses of the future are put through their paces under the watchful gaze of @entity13			0
miss @entity0 told @entity14 that employers should do everything they can to ' inspire the next generation ' who will continue to lack the necessary skills without being given the chance to experience the world of work			1
miss @entity0 claims shows like @entity8 , where candidates gaining work experience by undertaking a series of tasks , can act as inspiration for employers to open their doors to young people trying to enter the jobs market			1
more than a quarter of a million young people have taken part in employer - led placements or work experience through @entity49 since january 2011 , according to the @entity50			1
miss @entity0 said : ' it 's the age old problem – the young people i meet tell me they need work experience to get a job , but they need a job to get work experience			1
' that 's why we hugely increased the number of work experience placements available and why our advisers in @entity49 work closely with local businesses to provide tailored training opportunities for young jobseekers across the @entity66			0
' latest figures show that in the three months to july , 16.6 per cent of 16 - 24 - year - olds were unemployed , down from 21 per cent a year earlier , but still higher than the 13.8 per cent seen in early 2008			0

she said : ' people who have been successful in business have a huge amount to offer young people who are just starting out			1
' they know about the drive and determination it takes to work your way up through the ranks , or to set up in business and go it alone			0
' this kind of first hand experience can be invaluable in inspiring our young people to work hard and build a career			2
' i 'd like to appeal to bosses around the country to do everything they can to inspire the next generation			0
' our young people are some of the best and most talented in the world - they are driven , entrepreneurial and innovative , and with the help of people who have already made it in the world of work , they can go on to be the bosses and employers of the future			2
' as the new series of the @entity8 starts i 'd encourage a generation of young people to consider getting work experience and support from us to make their dream of being their own boss become a reality			1
' in the show , over-ambitious would - be bosses are put through a series of tests , which miss @entity0 argues are a good way of showing young people the realities of running a business however , last year @entity127 business secretary @entity126 said @entity8 should change its name because the bizarre challenges and on - the - spot sackings could put people off starting apprenticeships			1
' i know that @entity8 is designed to be dramatic television viewing but it has very little to do with apprentices – people who are doing a serious piece of vocational training , ' he said			0
' i worry that whatever the attractions of the programme as a piece of tv theatre , it gives people a completely false impression about what being an apprentice actually involves			2
