confession : the note that @entity2 wrote explains the motives behind the bombings and says that he does n't mourn his brother because he is a martyr @entity2 thought he was dying when he was hiding out in a boat following the @entity8 bombings and chose to write a note confessing his connection to the blasts and explaining why he and his brother made the two pressure cooker bombs			1
the 19 - year - old found a pen in the boat but no paper so it was revealed today that he wrote his message on an interior wall of the boat that he used as shelter in @entity23			1
his message was clear : ' @entity24 '			2
in other portions of his message , @entity28 reports that he wrote ' @entity29 ' and mentioned ' infidels ' across the interior walls of the boat that are now riddled with bullets			1
law enforcement sources told @entity35 that @entity2 wrote that he ' does not mourn ' the death of his older brother @entity37 because he is a martyr living in ' paradise ' and that he expected to join him there soon			1
the note is a critical piece of evidence for police as it reiterates what @entity2 said to them in the hospital after his arrest			2
aside from simply confirming his other statements , it could serve as back up for the eventual legal case against him because the reported confession to police came before @entity2 was read his @entity55 rights informing him of his right to remain silent			1
after they were read , he reportedly stopped talking to police , but now the note will serve as a handwritten confession			2
caught : @entity2 wrote the note on the interior wall of the boat where he hid out following the city - wide manhunt damage : because police shot the boat when they were trying to catch the 19 - year - old , the note was riddled with bullet holes since he wrote it on an interior wall and not a piece of paper he wrote that the bombings were retribution for the various @entity74 crimes against muslims in @entity76 and @entity77			1
administrators at the @entity8 are looking to the future , saying that any runners who were unable to complete the race this year because of the bombings have been invited to race in next year 's competition free of charge			0
' @entity8 spectators are known for their impassioned support and unbridled enthusiasm , and they will give these returning athletes some of the loudest cheers at next year 's race , ' the group 's executive director @entity83 said			0
the symbolic move will be a costly one for the organization , as there were 5,633 runners who are eligible and will not have to submit the $ 110 entry fee			0
if every one of the invited runners come back next year , it will cost $ 619,630 for the marathon organizers			0
he equated the three people who were killed in the marathon bombings and the more than 250 others who were injured to ' collateral damage ' like the thousands of innocent @entity75 victims of @entity74 wars across the globe			0
' when you attack one @entity75 , you attack all @entity75 , ' he reportedly wrote			2
@entity35 reporter @entity109 pointed out that the note is just the latest piece of evidence that police are using in developing their theory that the @entity116 brothers worked alone and were self - radicalized rather than being the ‘ soldiers ’ for a larger group			0
investigators are still working to determine who else - if anyone - knew about the attack before it happened			0
while the note is undoubtedly a boost for the state 's case against the 19 - year - old suspect , who is now being held in the medical center of an area prison , it is hardly cut and dry			0
because police fired hundreds of bullets at the boat during their attempt to capture @entity2 , the note is riddled with bullet holes			1
he has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and the note will certainly be used in the case against him			0
others involved : @entity2 wrote that he would not mourn his ' martyr ' brother @entity37 ( left ) though police are still trying to determine if @entity37 's wife @entity143 ( right , seen in in 2007 ) knew about the bombings collateral damage : in his note , @entity2 said that the victims of the april 15 bombing were like the innocent muslims who had been killed in @entity74 wars abroad			1

@entity2 found a pen inside the boat he was using to hide out
could n't find paper so he wrote a confession on the interior wall
said he would n't miss his brother @entity37 because he was a ' martyr ' who was in ' paradise ' and @entity2 expected to join him soon
