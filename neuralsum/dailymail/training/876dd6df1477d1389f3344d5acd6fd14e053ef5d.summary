controversial : @entity0 , 51 , sparked fury on social media after questioning the authenticity of the @entity4 beheading videos author @entity0 has been accused of being ' disrespectful ' after suggesting footage of hostages being beheaded by @entity4 militants is n't real			1
the 51 - year - old @entity10 writer made a series of controversial statements questioning the authenticity of the footage in a number of messages on her @entity18 page			1
the initial post in which the feminist activist questions where the terror group are ' getting all these folks from ' was deleted			2
in another post , she also said that the @entity27 administration was sending troops to @entity29 to confront the @entity31 outbreak so they could return with the deadly infection - justifying a military takeover of @entity29			1
social media users quickly rounded on her with some suggesting her theories were ' crazy ' while others said her views were ' harmful ' and had disrespected the victims ' families			2
a video released on friday appeared to show @entity44 hostage @entity42 being beheaded by @entity45			2
he is the fourth person to have been brutally murdered at the hands of the extremists , and a fifth , former @entity49 ranger @entity48 , has been threatened as the next victim			0
after making the controversial statements over the weekend , @entity51 defended her actions saying she was criticizing the reporting of the story - suggesting the video had not been properly confirmed by two sources			0
the post , that was later taken down , said : ' ok two of the hostages just happened to go from long careers into the military to ... sudden humanitarian work ( same was true of the latest @entity44 hostage )			1
where are they getting all these folks from ? ' if someone is abducted there is a record with @entity71 and with @entity72			1
can someone please confirm that these organizations have any record of this person having been abducted ? ' the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) yesterday ran a depressingly sloppy editorial claiming that all the @entity4 beheading videos must be real because ' there are so many of them on youtube '			1
' @entity84 's journalism ? they also called @entity4 ' evil ' many times - which is not langauge of a news analysis , it is a theological category for some faiths and a @entity90 talking point ... this may all be true but it takes five people to stage an event like this - two to be ' parents ' - two to pose for the cameras ... one in a ninja outfit ... and one to contact the media that does not bother checking who any of these four other people are ... ' during the social media backlash , @entity102 said : ' do n't insult these people who have given their lives for humanitarian work			1
' the activities of all these people have been well documented over the years			1
they are known people with families and friends who have supported them			1
' after noticing some of the responses , she took to her @entity18 page again and wrote : ' i stand by what i wrote today : the videos of beheadings need to be independently confirmed before they are part of the historical record			1
they may well be completely accurate but there are not yet independent confirmations that they are accurate			0
' another post said : ' a commentator below self - identified as being the @entity77 reporter covering the hostage crisis			0
this reporter asked me to take my post about asking for confirmation of the hostage story down , as this reporter said that keeping it up is " irresponsible " and not respectful to the pain of the families involved			2
' once again to clarify			0
the reason i ask that media check and confirm a story like the series of videotaped beheadings of aid workers and journalists is that that is what journalists are supposed to do			0
it is sad and baffling to me that my post below reminding journalists to get two sources confirming information before they run stories repeating government talking points , is being interpreted as " a conspiracy theory "			0
' she also condemned president @entity27 's decision to send troops to @entity29 to help combat the @entity31 outbreak , suggesting the military will bring it back to the @entity10			1
she said : ' and ... tv news in @entity10 reporting @entity180 is sending three thousand troops to @entity182			2
. troops with no medical expertise			2
. to construct and run field hospitals for @entity31 ...			1
then they will be quarantined for 21 days ... and eventually come home			0
' disrespectful ' : one @entity189 user reacted angrily to the statement suggesting the comments were ' horrible ' reaction : @entity194 commentator @entity193 said @entity51 had crossed over into ' baseless conspiracy theories ' history : another user referred to her past achievements when questioning her controversial views ' a crazy idea as @entity182 and @entity201 already have a dense infrastructure if medical aid organizations on the ground ... many @entity29 ones ... that already have doctors nurses and well tested medical education networks that were activated to educate people about @entity208			1
i was in @entity210 and witnessed this			0
' what they do n't have is enough doctors or supplies			0
they need the @entity217 not the @entity180			0
so why send soldiers with no medical background ? ' @entity220 has long been on the agenda but @entity222 three thousand @entity31 - exposed @entity10 troops creates a direct vector into the @entity10 and whatever happens a narrative can exist to justify military condoning of @entity10 populations ... quarantining @entity10 ... emergency measures to limit travel ... crisis best left to military not civil authorities			1
' people in @entity182 and @entity201 know perfectly well how to build more buildings for more beds			2
. these are modern societies ... they just need money			0
there is no practical reason to put our soldiers in the eye if ebola			0
that is why i dont ( sic ) like this narrative			0
' @entity249 : in her most recent post , the author has said that she stands by what she wrote			0

writer , 51 , posted a number of @entity18 messages questioning footage
asked if there was any record of the hostages being abducted initially
claimed it would need at least five people to ' stage an event like this '
also suggested @entity27 's *deployment* of troops in @entity29 to fight @entity31 was a ploy for them to return infected by the deadly virus
