by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:15 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 03:15 est , 24 july 2013 warning : sir @entity2 has told @entity3 that leaving the @entity4 would condemn @entity5 to ' irrelevance ' on the world stage one of prince @entity9 ’s key advisers has warned @entity3 that leaving the @entity4 would condemn @entity5 to ‘ irrelevance ’ on the world stage			1
sir @entity2 , who briefed @entity12 over the @entity13 , accompanies the @entity14 and @entity15 on overseas tours advising on foreign policy			1
but in a move that could put the @entity20 on a collision course with the government , sir @entity2 has challenged mr @entity3 ’s willingness to put @entity5 ’s place in the @entity4 up for grabs			1
the prime minister has pledged to renegotiate the @entity5 ’s relationship with @entity28 and then hold an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			0
mr @entity3 has made clear that if he does not get a good deal he is prepared to campaign for @entity5 to leave the @entity4			1
yesterday he warned that public support for the @entity4 is ‘ wafer thin ’			0
but in a submission to the government ’s @entity4 review , sir @entity2 – a former @entity5 ambassador in @entity38 – warned that pulling out would undermine @entity5 ’s standing with its allies			1
he wrote : ‘ outside the @entity4 , our influence in @entity43 would be sharply diminished – but so it would be in the @entity45			0
the risk to the @entity5 of leaving the @entity4 is of a rapid drift into international irrelevance			2
‘ compelling economic arguments are made for the @entity5 ’s membership of the @entity4 , not least the importance of the single market in which we do almost half our trade			2
‘ but equally compelling are the strategic , security and diplomatic interests served by @entity5 membership , interests that would be seriously jeopardised were we to leave the @entity4			2
’ he claimed that @entity45 looks to the @entity4 as its ‘ natural partner ’ and believes that @entity5 ’s role is enhanced as a member			2
but president @entity63 has already given his tentative approval to mr @entity3 ’s plans			0
key figure : sir @entity2 is pictured with @entity12 , president @entity67 and then security adviser @entity68 on a visit to the @entity45 in 2002 the comments come after the @entity71 revealed how a @entity73 report – saying @entity4 membership was beneficial – was branded a whitewash by critics			1
yesterday , mr @entity3 insisted that @entity5 will win a new deal in the @entity4 because countries in the euro need to become ‘ more integrated ’ to solve their economic problems			1
he said : ‘ i ’m saying , ‘ ‘ you need to sort your stuff out – and we ’ll allow you to do that because you need to			0
” but at the same time those countries like @entity5 where , frankly , consent for the @entity4 is wafer thin , we need changes too			2
’ settling the issue : @entity3 , pictured at the @entity90 factory in @entity91 , says a referendum would solve the @entity4 issue for a generation speaking at a question and answer session in @entity91 , he added : ‘ i believe we can achieve a better settlement for @entity5 in @entity43 and then put that to the people in a referendum in 2017			1
i believe we ’d be able to settle this issue for a generation			0
’ sir @entity2 was at mr @entity12 ’s side in the run - up to the @entity13 in 2003 as his chief foreign policy adviser and gave evidence to the @entity106			1
he revealed that mr @entity12 drew up secret plans for the invasion nine months before the outbreak of war			0
but he urged caution on mr @entity12 , telling the inquiry that he thought @entity5 should not have gone to war without a second @entity115 resolution and that weapons inspectors should have ‘ been given longer ’ to search for @entity117			0
he also expressed doubts that the war was worth the cost in ‘ blood and treasure ’			0
sir @entity2 ’s views are significant since he has acted as an unpaid adviser on foreign affairs to prince @entity9 and the @entity15 since 2009			1
leading @entity128 @entity127 mp @entity126 last night urged prince @entity9 to seek advice from a broader range of advisers			0
he said : ‘ sir @entity2 has provided the establishment view , which is palpable nonsense and totally out of touch with what ordinary people think			1
‘ they want us to be a small part of a @entity43 superstate , but we ’ll be a more important country in the world if we are an independent country with our own foreign policy			0
‘ i hope royalty from the @entity146 down will listen to a range of views and realise what ordinary people are saying			0
