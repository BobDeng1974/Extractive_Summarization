grieving families who were unable to identify the remains of their loved ones who died in the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , may finally be able to lay them to rest with the help of @entity5			1
scientists in @entity7 are carrying out painstaking work on the last known fragments of people who died in the @entity12 - hoping to use dna to be identify those who remain missing			1
each day a dedicated team of forensic scientists sift through thousands of vacuum - sealed plastic pouches filled with bits of bone rest in a @entity20 laboratory			1
tests : @entity22 , right , assistant director for forensic biology at the @entity24 , speaks as a trainee forensic scientist , prepares sample bone fragments for dna testing at the training lab in @entity7 on saturday , the 7,930 pouches are due to be moved in a solemn procession from the city medical examiner 's office to the new trade center site			1
they will be kept in a bedrock repository 70 feet underground in the new september 11 @entity37 that opens may 21			1
the museum will charge $ 24 for entrance but the remains will not be a part of the exhibit			0
the move will mean that families who have effectively been living in limbo since their loved - ones were killed on that fateful day will have somewhere that they can go to be with the remains			2
the remains will be accessible only to families of the dead and to the forensic scientists who are still trying to match the bone slivers to dna from the more than 1,000 victims who never came home and have never been identified			2
bone grinding : @entity57 works to match the bone with @entity5 from victims who have never been identified new technology : advances in technology have yielded results impossible 10 years ago to match the bone with @entity5 from those who died on sept. 11 , 2001 office of chief medical examiner in @entity7 : families have renewed hope to be able to formally find their lost loved ones by using the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone freezer : scientists are using this device for milling and extracting @entity5 , at the @entity24 in @entity7 dna : @entity57 prepares to enter the bone grinding room at the @entity24 in @entity7 - the room is central to the examination of bone dna from those who died on sept. 11 however , while the bereaved families have long endorsed the ongoing identification process , some have protested against this weekend 's move of the remains			1
they fear that the museum site could be prone to flooding after witnessing the aftermath of @entity89 which swept through lower @entity20 in 2012 , flooding buildings and causing widespread water damage			0
@entity92 , a mother who lost her firefighter son at the @entity12 pleaded at a protest on thursday : ' do n't put them [ the remains ] in the basement			2
' ' give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace , ' she said			0
@entity101 : @entity102 , the mother of deceased firefighter @entity104 , pauses before attending a press conference opposing the placement of unknown human remains of victims in the basement of the @entity110 at @entity111 however , @entity22 , who oversees the four - member @entity12 team in the city 's @entity114 , is keen to stress that the remains will be treated with the utmost respect			1
' our commitment to return the remains to the families is as great today as it was in 2001 , ' he said			0
over 2,753 people were reported missing at the @entity12 after it was attacked on a sunny september morning in downtown @entity20			2
of those victims , 1,115 victims - at least 41 percent - have not been identified through a dna match to items provided by families — toothbrushes , combs , clothing or swabs from relatives			1
justice : attorney @entity135 says families oppose the placement of unknown human remains of victims in the basement of the @entity110 listen to us : retired @entity7 deputy fire chief @entity142 , left , whose son was killed in the @entity12 attacks , and @entity146 , sister of firefighter @entity147 , also killed on 9 - 11 , say they are being ignored grief : @entity92 , left , @entity150 , second left , attorney @entity151 , @entity146 , and retired @entity7 fire chief @entity142 protest in front of a fire station opposite the @entity110 renewed hope : @entity92 , the mother of deceased firefighter @entity104 holds his image as she protests over 9/11 remains but technological advances in dna testing has given the families renewed hope as the process of identification has become far easier than it was a decade ago			1
families want to be able to formally find their lost loved ones by using the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone			2
it is , in fact , the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible to officially confirm what they already know : their loved one died			0
in some cases , scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 15 times , using new technology to attempt to extract dna diminished by fire , sunlight , bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the towers			2
four new identifications were made this past year			0
by december , the latest technology will have been applied to every remnant in the medical examiner 's possession , exhausting the available methods , for now			0
beyond this year , families who still have not been given any hope of finding their family members , will face uncertainty about how long and at what cost the forensic team will keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains			0

however , @entity244 , founding director of the @entity245 at the @entity246 , said that work must continue ' because our relationship to the september 11 disaster hinges on being able to identify and pay respects to those who died			1
' he said : ' the @entity12 attack was more cruel than death usually is , because some people were simply incinerated and those remains went into the air			2
' for mr @entity22 and those like him who work on the remains , it 's not just a grim scientific task — it 's personal			0
he said that ms @entity92 's missing firefirghting son was under the still - standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them , having rushed down with the then - chief medical examiner , dr. @entity269			0

pouches will be moved to new @entity12 and kept in repository
