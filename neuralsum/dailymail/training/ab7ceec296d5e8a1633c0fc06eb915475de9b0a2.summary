leading @entity1 doctors have called for the government to remove @entity4 breast implants fitted to 50,000 women following damning new research that shows their shells are faulty			1
the casings are more likely to degrade than those used in others – leaving women given @entity14 at risk of silicone leaking into their bodies , the research showed			1
the doctors who conducted the research , including nanotechnology professor @entity20 and top plastic surgeon professor @entity21 , now say all @entity14 should be removed			1
leaking risk : surgeons operate to remove a @entity4 implant in @entity25 @entity26 , former president of the @entity27 , said last night : ‘ if you have problems with the outer shell of an implant , then it will act like a sieve and the silicone will just leak out			1
‘ the batch testing for these implants was useless so we do n’t know which women could be most at risk – it ’s a lottery			1
i ’d say to women : have them out			0
’ the scandal over @entity25 - manufactured @entity4 implants erupted in 2011 when it was shown that they were more than twice as likely to rupture than other implants and that they were filled with industrial - grade silicone used in mattress production			1
women whose implants burst have complained of swollen lymph nodes , lumps and pains in their breasts			2
but despite @entity25 authorities agreeing to remove the implants from all women fitted with them as a preventative measure , officials in the @entity1 have continued to insist there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine removal			1
instead , the @entity63 will pay for women to have them removed only if specialists believe that there is a ‘ clinical need ’ to do so and if the private clinics that fitted them refuse to remove them			2
the @entity63 will not pay to have them replaced			0
but the latest research has fuelled further calls for the government to introduce a blanket policy to remove all @entity14 because of the risks			1
the study examined 18 pip implants removed from patients between january and march 2012			0
the researchers , from the @entity79 in @entity80 and @entity81 , tested the strength of the material in the @entity14			0
the study found the shells were ‘ significantly weaker ’ than other brands			0
toxic fears : a woman calls for fair treatment over implants senior surgeons last night said the study should be taken seriously amid claims that the @entity63 has been failing to address the needs of women			1
@entity96 , a member of the government - commissioned panel investigating the @entity4 scandal and chair of the professional standards committee of the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , said : ‘ this is very good research based on good science which gives us a better understanding as to why the shells are rupturing			1
‘ @entity103 ’s view remains that the @entity14 will all need to come out eventually , like any implant – just not in a short - term rush			0
’ about 95 per cent of women with @entity14 had them fitted by a private clinic , while a minority of operations were carried out on the @entity63 , mostly for breast reconstruction following cancer			2
plastic - surgery chain @entity119 insisted it could not afford to remove implants from patients and recently went into administration to avoid potential legal claims			2
the @entity25 manufacturer of the implants also closed shortly after the scandal broke			0
the @entity63 medical director , professor sir @entity128 , is looking at whether the cosmetic surgery industry needs to be more effectively regulated as a result of the scandal			0
@entity132 , from the @entity133 , said many women hoping to have their @entity14 removed on the @entity63 were being turned away by @entity135 or discouraged by specialists			0
‘ women ’s psychological trauma and needs are totally ignored			0
some women can not afford the high costs of private surgery and are having to live with the terror			0
’ a statement from the @entity146 said : ‘ this study has revealed nothing new			0
our expert group report , which was published in june , made it clear that @entity4 implants were more likely to rupture than others			1
‘ extensive testing of the @entity4 gel material has not revealed anything that could cause a long - term threat to human health – they are not toxic and not carcinogenic			2
’ shadow public health minister @entity159 said : ‘ the government has to put pressure on private companies to remove implants from any woman who requests it			2
