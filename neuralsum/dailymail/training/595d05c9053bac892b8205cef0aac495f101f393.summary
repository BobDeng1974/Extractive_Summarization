the drug @entity0 gets flu victims back on their feet faster and reduces complications , claim researchers after the most exhaustive investigation to date			1
a major analysis of all published and unpublished trials found it shortens symptoms by a day and cuts the risk of ancillary infections and hospital care			0
controversy has raged over the effectiveness of the drug , with allegations that regulators , researchers and doctors did not have access to vital information from clinical trials			1
controversy : debate had raged over how effective @entity0 was - but the new study claims that it cuts hospital admissions for flu by 63 % and shortens symptoms of the virus by a day last year , a review concluded @entity0 and @entity31 did not reduce admission to hospital or complications from flu such as pneumonia – a key reason for governments worldwide to stockpile them to reduce the impact of a pandemic			1
but new evidence published in the @entity44 journal shows @entity0 is more effective than previously thought			1
the research by the @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 found the drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces by 44 per cent respiratory infections that sometimes develop			1
study co-author dr @entity53 , the @entity54 at the @entity55 , said ‘ this is the first patient - level analysis of how well this drug works			2
‘ previous research has questioned its success and use in light of the side effects of nausea and vomiting , but the other studies combined those infected with influenza and those without , which diluted the positive effect in treatment			0
’ researchers conducted meta - analysis of data from all published and unpublished clinical trials – made available by manufacturer @entity76 - from 1997 - 2001			1
more than 4,300 patients were involved – more than half of whom were treated with @entity0			1
the drug shortens the duration of symptoms by about one day and reduces respiratory infections that sometimes develop by 44 per cent , researchers found the drug , also known as oseltamivir , was shown to reduce the duration of the illness by 21 per cent			1
with the drug , symptom alleviation occurred , on average , at 98 hours compared with 123 hours with placebo			0
in addition to reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections requiring antibiotics , like pneumonia ( 4.9 per cent had complications with the drug compared with 8.7 per cent on placebo ) , the drug decreased hospital admissions by 63 per cent			2
the researchers also found some of the same complications of the drug noted in previous research , with an increase in nausea ( 3.7 per cent ) and vomiting ( 4.7 per cent )			2
they did not find more neurological or psychological disorders in those taking the drug			0
professor @entity111 , director of the centre for @entity113 at @entity114 , said : ‘ the important thing about this study is that it shows that @entity76 were not hiding skeletons in its cupboards			0
‘ as a full review of the published and unpublished data , it leaves the conclusion unaltered that oseltamivir reduces symptom duration by about a day while causing nausea and vomiting in a minority of recipients			0
the drug decreased hospital admissions from influenza ( pictured under the microscope ) by 63 per cent ‘ @entity0 is not a perfect drug but does what you might expect of an antiviral given relatively late in the course of an acute infection and after the illness has already become established			2
‘ the finding that it reduces hospitalisation by 63 per cent is especially important , reinforcing the call for family practitioners to use antivirals early rather than resorting to antibiotics , which are of no proven benefit in uncomplicated flu			0
’ dr @entity147 , director of the @entity148 for @entity149 , @entity150 ( @entity151 ) , said the use of antiviral medicines can have an important role in reducing the impact of flu			0
he added : ‘ the authors of the current study concluded that oseltamivir treatment resulted in shorter periods of illness , and moreover , because of the ability to put together the results from many trials , the authors concluded that influenza patients treated with oseltamivir had a reduced risk of being hospitalised or having antibiotics prescribed for lower respiratory tract infection			2
‘ however , the authors also noted that treatment with oseltamivir induced an increased rate of reporting nausea , and pointed out that the risks and benefits of oseltamivir use still need to be considered carefully			0
