by @entity0 @entity1 might be over but jet - set celebrities and high - flying executives can order the ultimate new toy - a private supersonic jet			0
the aircraft claims to be the ' first supersonic business jet ' and promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from @entity11 to @entity12 in just three hours			1
however , such convenience and speed comes at a price , as the jet will cost between $ 60million and $ 80million ( £ 36.3million and £ 48.4million )			0
the engineers , who have previously worked for aerospace giants such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , have spent the past two years designing the luxury aircraft and believe the jet will be capable of flying between @entity11 and @entity12 in three hours			1
@entity35 to @entity36 will take just five hours and @entity12 to @entity37 , four hours , according to the firm			1
‘ it will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world , ' the company said			0
' would n’t you love to go hiking in @entity44 for the weekend , or fly to @entity45 for lunch ? created by a team of @entity24 - based engineers , the @entity21 aims to be the ultimate business aircraft that can reach speeds of 1,100mph , or @entity49 ‘ the supersonic jet will let you do more , faster , ’ it added			1
the jet , which is designed to carry between 12 and 18 passengers in the lap of luxury , is intended to take off in december 2018			0
however , despite impressive engineering , the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) has banned supersonic flight over the @entity58 making popular flights such as @entity35 to @entity11 unlikely in the near future			1
companies including @entity62 and @entity63 are currently trying to develop supersonic aircraft of their own to reduce the noise - or boom - that the jets make when breaking the sound barrier			2
the jet is scheduled to take off in december 2018 , and will cost between $ 60million and $ 80million or £ 36.3million to £ 48.4million @entity69 , president and ceo of @entity21 , wrote in a blog that @entity73 , founder of @entity74 and @entity75 , told a @entity11 times @entity77 conference that ' there ’s an interesting opportunity to create a supersonic , electric , vertical take - off and landing jet			2
' ‘ it seems unlikely to come from @entity63 or @entity30 , given that they seem to be focused on very incremental improvements to their planes as opposed to radical improvements			0
so it could come from a start - up			0
‘ if i were to have another company in the future , which would not be any time soon , i think that would be the thing do , ’ he added			0
mr @entity69 said aspirations of vertical take - off and landing might be ‘ a stretch ’ for the first iteration of a new supersonic aircraft			2
despite impressive engineering , the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) has banned supersonic flight over the @entity58 making popular flights such as @entity35 to @entity11 unlikely in the near future			1

the @entity21 claims to be the ' first supersonic business jet '
it promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from @entity11 to @entity12 in just three hours
the supersonic aircraft was designed by a team of engineers in @entity24 , @entity58 and has a top speed of 1,100mph , or @entity49
@entity35 to @entity36 will take just five hours and @entity12 to @entity37 , four hours
