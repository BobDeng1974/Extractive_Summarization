by @entity0 researchers have uncovered a hidden world underneath @entity3			1
beneath the barren whiteness , researchers say there are a vast series of sculptures the size of skyscrapers			2
using ice - penetrating radar , researchers have discovered the ragged blocks of ice as tall as city skyscrapers and as wide as the island of @entity15 at the very bottom of the ice sheet			1
using ice penetrating radar , researchers have discovered the ragged blocks of ice as tall as city skyscrapers and as wide as the island of @entity15 at the very bottom of the @entity3 ice sheet			1
the structures cover about a tenth of northern @entity3 , the researchers estimate , becoming bigger and more common as the ice sheet narrows into ice streams , or glaciers , headed for the sea			1
as meltwater at the bottom refreezes over hundreds to thousands of years , the researchers believe it radiates heat into the surrounding ice sheet , making it pick up its pace as the ice becomes softer and flows more easily			2
the structures formed as water beneath the ice refreezes and warps the surrounding ice upwards			1
the newly revealed forms may help scientists understand more about how ice sheets behave and how they will respond to a warming climate , the researchers say in @entity43			2
' we see more of these features where the ice sheet starts to go fast , ' said the study 's lead author , @entity47 , a geophysicist at @entity50 's @entity49			0
' we think the refreezing process uplifts , distorts and warms the ice above , making it softer and easier to flow			1

after @entity67 , @entity3 's ice cap contains the second largest mass of frozen freshwater in the world			1
the ice sheet ice sheet covers 660,000 sq miles ( 1,710,000 square km ) , or roughly 80 per cent of the surface of @entity3			1
currently , melting from @entity3 accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise			1
since the 1970s , and as recently as 1998 , researchers flying over the region mistook radar images of these structures for hills			0
newer instruments flown during @entity83 's @entity82 campaign to map ice loss at both poles found the hills to be made of ice instead of rock			0
the same area , seen from above - showing no signed of the warped ice below @entity47 , who had discovered similar ice features at the base of the @entity94 ice sheet , recognized them immediately			0
while mapping @entity67 's ice - covered @entity97 in 2008 and 2009 , @entity47 and colleagues discovered extensive melting and refreezing along ridges and steep valley walls of the range			1
though researchers had long known that pressure and friction can melt the bottom of ice sheets , no one knew that refreezing water could deform the layer - cake structure above			1
the topography of @entity3 is shown in this graphic with hidden valleys in blue by previous research into the area			2
on the right is the bed topography beneath the ice sheet			0
on the left is the surface topography and ice velocities in a 2011 study in @entity122 , @entity47 and colleagues proposed that ice sheets can grow from the bottom up , not just from the top - down accumulation of falling snow.the current study builds on the findings from @entity67 by linking the bottom features to faster ice sheet flow			0
the researchers looked at @entity132 in the north of @entity3 , which made headlines in 2010 when a 100 - square mile chunk of ice slipped into the sea			1
they discovered that @entity132 is sweeping a dozen large features with it toward the coast as it funnels off the ice sheet ; one feature sits where satellite data has shown part of the glacier racing twice as fast as nearby ice			0
the researchers suggest that the refreeze process is influencing the glacier 's advance hundreds of miles from where @entity153 floats onto the sea			0
' overall , these observations suggest that basal freeze - on is a key control on the large - scale flow of @entity132 , a possibility that has not been explored previously , ' writes @entity161 researcher @entity160 in the same issue of @entity43			0
@entity3 's glaciers appear to be moving more rapidly toward the sea as climate warms but it remains unclear how the refreeze process will influence this trend , the researchers said			2
they expected to find bottom features in the ice sheet 's interior , as they did in @entity67 , but did not expect to see features at the edges , where lakes form and rivers flow over the surface , they said			0
water from those lakes and rivers appears to fall through crevasses and other holes in the ice to reach the base of the ice sheet , where some of it apparently refreezes			0
their discovery indicates that refreezing and deformation at the base of the ice sheet may be far more widespread than previously thought			2
@entity47 and her colleagues believe that similar features may come to light as other parts of @entity3 and @entity67 are studied in closer detail			2
flying over northern @entity3 during the 2011 @entity82 season , @entity194 , a geophysicist at @entity49 , sat up straight when the radar images began to reveal a deformed layer - cake structure			1
' when you 're flying over this flat , white landscape people almost fall asleep it 's so boring â€” layer cake , layer cake , layer cake , ' said @entity194 , a study coauthor			0
' but then suddenly these things appear on the screen			0
you get a sense of these invisible processes happening underneath			0

giant ' warps ' in the ice caused by melting and refreezing

blocks of ice are as tall are as city skyscrapers and as wide as the island of @entity15
