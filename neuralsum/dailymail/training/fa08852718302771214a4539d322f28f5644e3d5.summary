by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 is set to leave @entity3 on thursday after the club ’s patience with results reached breaking point			1
the @entity8 was called to @entity9 for talks with chairman @entity11 yesterday after tuesday ’s home defeat against @entity13 left them 17th in the @entity16 table			1
owner @entity17 is not believed to have been at the meeting			0
a senior club source told @entity20 that the former @entity23 striker ’s exit has been decided , with only the final details of his departure to be agreed			0
confirmation from the club is expected this morning			0
@entity2 is on the brink of being sacked as @entity3 manager @entity2 ( left ) looks dejected after @entity3 's defeat to @entity13 on tuesday night @entity32 manager @entity31 has emerged as frontrunner to replace @entity2 if he is sacked at @entity3 relations between @entity2 and the club ’s hierarchy are said to be ‘ amicable ’ , but dire early - season results forced @entity17 to act			1
former @entity38 midfielder @entity31 , 37 , who took over at @entity32 in january and led them to the @entity16 title , emerged on wednesday night as the leading candidate to replace @entity2 , though @entity43 , @entity45 manager @entity44 and @entity46 , who was pictured in the directors ’ box on tuesday , are also in the frame			1
a compensation settlement will need to be agreed for @entity2 , with the 41 - year - old said to have been appointed on a staggering £ 4million a year when he was lured to @entity51 from @entity52 in january			2
the terms of his ‘ rolling contract ’ are understood to have been reduced after the club were relegated last season			0
despite the club ’s relegation as the @entity61 ’s bottom club — @entity3 were 17th when his predecessor @entity62 was sacked — @entity17 was determined to stick with @entity2 , though it was made clear that promotion in this campaign was the only acceptable target			1
@entity68 celebrates after scoring against @entity3 for @entity13 @entity2 ( right ) applauds the fans as @entity3 lose to @entity70 to confirm relegation last season instead , @entity3 have plummeted after a promising start and are winless in four @entity16 games			1
on saturday , they gave up a two - goal lead at home against @entity77 and lost 4 - 2 , and the final straw appears to have been the limp 1 - 0 loss against @entity13 at the @entity80			0
in all , @entity3 have won only five of their 25 league matches under @entity2			2
the poor results come in spite of vast investment in the squad , with @entity17 having spent roughly £ 16m on 17 new players since @entity2 took over and permitting @entity11 to sign off on one of the division ’s biggest wage bills			2
but @entity2 has consistently given off the impression that he does not know his best line - up , having kept an unchanged side only once in league fixtures			0
more than that , his promise of attacking football , which was so alluring to @entity17 , has not materialised , with only eight goals scored in the league this season			0
of further concern to the club , the 19,711 gate for the @entity13 match was their lowest for a league fixture in four years .			2
