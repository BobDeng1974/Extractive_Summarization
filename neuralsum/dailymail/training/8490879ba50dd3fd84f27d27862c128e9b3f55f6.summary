a former gunner in the @entity1 had his dying wish granted when his ashes were fired from a 19th century cannon			1
@entity5 was given the unusual send off following a service which was a re-enactment of an 1880s officer 's funeral carried out by 20 people at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
mr @entity5 served 24 years in the @entity1 , working his way up through the ranks to warrant officer class 2			1
the cannon at @entity10 in @entity11 , which was used to fire the ashes of former soldier @entity5 he started his military career with the @entity19 before joining the 45 @entity20 in 1971			1
he was posted to the @entity21 and in the late 1970s he was eventually promoted to warrant officer			1
when he realised he was losing his battle with cancer he told his friends and family how he wanted his ashes to be fired from a cannon rather than scattered			1
in july he died aged 59 after suffering from brain and lung tumours for almost four years			1
and almost straight away , his former army comrades @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 started working on how to fulfil his final request			1
mr @entity5 served for 24 years in the @entity1 and started his career in the 1970s , right , before being promoted to a warrant officer mr @entity31 then contacted the @entity1 but was told it would cost them £ 3,000			1
after sharing the news with former colleagues on @entity40 , it was suggested that they ask at the local fort			0
they then got in touch with @entity44 , who runs the @entity46 re-enactment group , who agreed to carry out the stunt			2
mr @entity31 explained : ' i went to visit him just after last @entity49			0
i was chatting to him about how he was feeling and he just came out with it - " i want my ashes fired over @entity52 , @entity53			1
" ' i just laughed and said that ’s typical of you @entity5 , wanting the impossible			1
' he had been thinking about it ever since he was diagnosed			0
mr @entity5 's army comrade @entity31 , who organised the final send - off along with old colleagues @entity32 and @entity33 ' when i contacted the @entity1 they were n’t overly happy to do it and they wanted about £ 3,000			1
' on @entity40 i asked other ex-servicemen who knew @entity5 what to do and @entity32 suggested the fort			2
' he got in touch with them and they wanted far less money so we started organising it			0
' it was perfect for @entity5 and his attitude			2
he kept fighting until the end			0
' about 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to see mr @entity5 ’s ashes fired from a six - pounder , smoothbore 1800 cannon in the 30 - minute ceremony			1
his daughter @entity79 said : ' it was a hard weekend for us because it was the final thing , but it was a nice way to say goodbye			2
' he would have been really chuffed with it			0
he was not the shy and retiring type , i think it would have been really special to him			0
' i ’m really happy we were able to do what he wanted and it was really touching that all his army friends went to so much effort			0
' around 30 family members and former comrades travelled from all over the country to attend the service including his daughter @entity79 , pictured with her husband @entity94 , centre the cannon is about 60 inches long and has a range of more than 4,500 feet			1
it was prepared by putting in a bag of black powder , followed by a bag of @entity5 ’s ashes and then lighting the fuse			2
mr @entity44 explained : ' when @entity32 contacted me and asked if it was possible to fire @entity5 ’s ashes from the cannon , i had to look into it and make sure it was still legal			1
' looking back through the records the last ceremony was before the @entity110 , so it ’s been over 100 years			2
' people had spoken to us about this sort of thing before , but it never actually got to the point of organising it			0
' on the day it was n’t just a case of me firing the cannon , it was a whole period show			0
we had 20 re-enactors in full uniform who performed full military honours for @entity5			2
' we fired his ashes out of the cannon twice , once to start the minute ’s silence and once to signify the end and had a bugle playing the last post			2
' there were obviously a few tears as the bugle played but his family were really happy with how it went			0
' his son and daughter came up to me and said they were n’t expecting so much to be put in			0
@entity44 of the @entity46 with the cannon that was used to fire mr @entity5 's ashes ' for @entity5 , he was an artillery man and had spent his whole life working with guns			1
it ’s something different but his family said it summed him up completely			0
he had a good sense of humour			0
' they were so chuffed and that was really important to us			0
' since the ceremony , the group have had seven enquiries from families who want to arrange a similar send - off			1
@entity10 was built between 1860 and 1872 by @entity158 of the @entity159 to protect @entity161 ’s harbour , which was then becoming an important @entity163 base			2
it included bomb proof casemates for cannons arranged around the sides , and played an important role in @entity169 , when the harbour was used as base by the @entity173 and @entity174 navy			0
in 1956 the fort was abandoned , and in 1961 it was purchased by the local council			0
it is now a museum , attracting thousands of tourists each year .			0
