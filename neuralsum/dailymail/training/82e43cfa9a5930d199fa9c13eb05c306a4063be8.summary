now the work of the @entity14 - born shutterbug will go on display for the first time in @entity17 in an exhibition at the @entity19			2
among the 118 images to feature , most of which date from the 1960s , are 55 rarely seen snaps , including one that shows holidaymakers posing with their caravan in @entity28 and another that features day - trippers relaxing by their car in @entity31			2

' @entity1 ' pictures were about @entity9 , ' says @entity48 , a contemporary whose work , dating from the 1970s , also features in the exhibition			1
' they had that contrast , that seedy eccentricity , but they showed it in a very subtle way			0
