@entity1 , 17 , had been examined by three doctors and a paramedic six days before he died			1
after he began coughing up blood - a key symptom of septicaemia - his mother @entity13 begged one paramedic to rush the teen to hospital			1
but she was told his condition was not bad enough and that he should take some paracetamol			1
the paramedic added : ' if i was to take every 17 - year - old boy coughing up blood , the system would grind to a halt , ' the inquest heard			1
mr @entity1 's condition worsened the following day			1
his mother told the hearing that when she phoned trainee gp dr @entity30 for help he also dismissed her concerns			1
hours later mrs @entity34 dialled 999 and the teen was finally taken to @entity37 in @entity38 on december 21 , 2010 , by another paramedic			2
he died the following morning			2
mr @entity1 , from @entity40 , @entity38 , had first gone to his gp , dr @entity42 , on december 16 - the day after his 17th birthday - and was told he had a ' nasty cold , possibly flu '			1
giving evidence at the inquest , dr @entity42 said he had received a message stating mrs @entity34 was concerned her son ' was burning up ' and was ' worried about swine flu '			0
he said : ' my initial concern was that this could it be something such as meningitis , so i asked did he have a rash , which mrs @entity54 replied that he did n't			1
' then she went on to explain that he did n't have any pain in his neck			0
that reassured me that it was much less likely to be meningitis			0
' days later he developed ' uncomplicated septicaemia ' which could have been cured by a course of antibiotics , but was again wrongly diagnosed with flu			2
mrs @entity54 told @entity66 she had been left frustrated by the medics who examined her son			1
the day before he died she said it was clear her son needed urgent medical attention			2

' the inquest heard dr @entity30 had told mrs @entity34 to bring her son into the surgery but failed to record the information about his deteriorating condition			1
dr @entity30 , who is now fully qualified , told the inquest : ' i did n't appreciate the blue tinge to him while talking to mrs @entity34			0
' i can not for the life of me understand why			0
i deeply regret not picking that up			0
' recording a narrative verdict , deputy coroner for @entity97 , @entity98 , said : ' to @entity1 ’s family there are n’t enough words in the dictionary to describe what you have been through			2
' as a family your dignity throughout these proceedings has been nothing short of inspirational			0
you have done your son proud , if he was anything like his parents , he must have been quite a lad			0
' after the hearing mr @entity1 's parents @entity113 and @entity13 said they hoped lessons had been learned			1
' hopefully we can take something positive away from the tragic catalogue of errors which took our son away from us , ' ” mr @entity1 's father said			1
' we hope medical professionals can become better at spotting the early signs of sepsis so it can be spotted early and lives can be saved			0
we do n’t want anyone to go through what we ’ve been through			0
' something as simple as asking when someone last passed urine can save lives			0
if it ’s a long time it ’s more than likely they need to go to hospital			0

he would literally do anything for anyone			0
