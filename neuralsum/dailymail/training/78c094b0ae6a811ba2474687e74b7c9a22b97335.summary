@entity0 has made no secret of the fact that @entity3 are won with great teamwork , so it should come as no surprise to see him and @entity6 expertly riding a tandem bicycle together			1
the duo were taking part in a special race against @entity11 and @entity13 golfer @entity12 ahead of this week 's @entity14 in @entity15			1
just as most of @entity0 's pairings at @entity19 worked perfectly in tandem , his ride with @entity17 looked to be a great success ... even if the @entity22 admitted afterwards : ' i was hanging on for dear life			1
' @entity0 and @entity6 ride a tandem bicycle across the fairways at @entity27 @entity17 looks a little worried as the pair head off on their race ( left ) but appears to have relaxed later ( right ) @entity17 and @entity0 were racing against @entity11 and @entity12 in a special race in @entity13 perhaps the @entity34 @entity33 taskforce , set up to address their consistent failures in the biennial showpiece against @entity37 , should take a look at the pictures			1
perhaps @entity40 should be encouraged to ride in tandem with the next @entity34 captain			2
well , good luck with that			0
the @entity14 is the first event of the @entity47 's season - ending @entity46 , which sees the climax of @entity49 to @entity50			1
but after @entity52 's spectacular summer , @entity17 admits he has little chance of catching the @entity55 and @entity34 @entity56 champion to be crowned @entity37 's no 1 this year			1
instead , the former @entity55 winner has set himself a new target during the next month : reaching no 2 in the world rankings			0
@entity17 is currently ranked sixth in the world but has been as high as third following his triumph at @entity63 last year			2
he now wants to go one better			0
@entity17 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity0 play from a bunker on the 18th hole prior to the @entity14 @entity11 tees off during the pro-am event prior to the tournament , which starts on thursday former @entity55 champion @entity17 gets in the swing ahead of the first of this year 's @entity46 events ' i ’m not sure i can catch @entity52 in @entity49 to @entity50 , ' said @entity17 , who is eighth in the money list but a long way behind the runaway leader			1
' but the bonus pool runs deep down to 15th and i want to strengthen my world ranking as much as possible			0
' if i can play well and maybe win a couple of tournaments between now and the end of the season , i could probably get up to second in the world , which would be a personal best			0
so there ’s always something to play for			0
' @entity11 arrived at @entity27 hoping for a happy ending to a difficult season			2
the @entity22 's latest troubling episode was being branded a ' @entity90 ' by @entity92 president @entity91 , who was subsequently sacked for his comments			0
captain @entity0 celebrates winning the @entity33 with his team at @entity19 last month @entity11 currently sits outside the top 60 who earn a place in the season - ending @entity50 showpiece			1
but the @entity22 was in a positive frame of mind after arriving in the country where he sealed his biggest career win to date , the @entity102 in 2012			0
a fun warm - up round of match play against @entity17 on the course they co-designed at @entity107 appears to have helped @entity11 's mood too			1
' it ’s always nice to come back to @entity110 and i ’ve got a decent record here , ' said @entity11			2
' i 've played well on this golf course in the past , so i ’m looking forward to getting going			0
' i ’ve been in @entity13 for five days , and opening the golf course with @entity6 was great fun			2
we had a little match play competition yesterday and he managed to beat me 3 and 2 , so it would be nice if i can go one up on him this week			0
