by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 17 september 2012 it is one of the strangest photographs returned from @entity4 yet - giving a snapshot of what @entity4 was like when it had a dynamic surface			1
the small spherical objects in this image from @entity10 - still scouring the surface of @entity4 after nearly 10 years on the @entity4 - are tiny mineral - rich nodules , nicknamed ' blueberries ' by @entity14 , which are sticking out of the face of a crater			1
now the opportunity has been joined by the @entity18 - but the older brother is still proving its worth , capturing the geological formations which show how @entity4 was once a wet world with surface water			1
the ' spherules ' are small - only three millimetres across each - and have been magnified for this image , which shows an area only 2.4inches ( 6 centimeters ) across			1
they appeared on an outcrop called ' @entity27 ' in the @entity28 of the western rim of @entity30			2
@entity32 ' blueberries ' : this is a 2.4inches ( 6cms ) patch of outcrop on the western rim of @entity30			2
the individual spherules are up to about three millimeters in diameter the @entity38 took the component images during the 3,064th @entity4 day of @entity10 's travels - september 6th by @entity40 time			1
opportunity discovered spherules at its landing site more than eight - and - a - half years earlier , and they were promptly nicknamed ' blueberries '			1
they provided important evidence about long - ago wet environmental conditions on @entity4 because researchers using @entity10 's science instruments identified them as concretions rich in the mineral ' hematite ' , which was deposited by water saturating the bedrock			1
however these spherules are different - they do not have the iron - rich composition of the blueberries , and also differ in concentration , distribution and structure			1
some of the spherules in this image have been partially eroded away , revealing concentric internal structure			0
landscape : opportunity captured this image of rock fins near @entity27 in july opportunity 's science team plans to use the rover for further investigation of these spherules to determine what evidence they can provide about ancient @entity4 environmental conditions			1
@entity10 ’s principal investigator , @entity76 of @entity77 , said : ' this is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission			0
self - portrait : this picture shows @entity10 casting a shadow on the rim of @entity30 ' @entity27 is chock full of a dense accumulation of these small spherical objects			2
of course , we immediately thought of the blueberries , but this is something different			2
we never have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on @entity4			1
' the @entity4 blueberries found elsewhere by @entity10 are concretions formed by action of mineral - laden water inside rocks , evidence of a wet environment on early @entity4			1
concretions result when minerals precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks			2
many of the @entity27 spheres are broken and eroded by the wind			0
where wind has partially etched them away , a concentric structure is evident			0
opportunity used the microscopic imagern its arm to look closely at @entity27			0
researchers checked the spheres ’ composition by using an instrument called the @entity118 on @entity10 ’s arm			0
@entity76 added : ' they seem to be crunchy on the outside , and softer in the middle. , they are different in concentration			1
they are different in structure			0
they are different in composition			0
they are different in distribution			0
' so , we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us			0
we have multiple working hypotheses , and we have no favorite hypothesis at this time			0
it ’s going to take a while to work this out , so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks do the talking			0
' just past @entity27 lies another science target area for @entity10			2
the location is an extensive pale - toned outcrop in an area of @entity28 where observations from orbit have detected signs of clay minerals			2
that may be the rover ’s next study site after @entity27			0
four years ago , @entity10 departed @entity152 , which it had investigated for two years , to reach different types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger @entity30			0
@entity156 : this is a 360 - degree view of the area where the opportunity rover spent its 3,000th day on @entity4			1

' blueberries ' are mineral - rich bumps on side of crater - indicating water on @entity4 's surface in the past
@entity14 : ' they seem to be crunchy on the outside , and softer in the middle '
