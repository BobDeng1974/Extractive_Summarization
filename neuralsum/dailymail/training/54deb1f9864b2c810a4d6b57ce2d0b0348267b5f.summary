the @entity0 have been described as the world ’s most idyllic bomb site			1
as i emerge from crystal water onto the much whispered about ‘ @entity5 ’ , i ’m inclined to agree			1
here i am , mere miles away from @entity6 , on @entity8 's west coast - but i could not feel further removed from this all - singing holiday resort			1
the @entity0 , to use their @entity11 name , were first formed centuries ago due to volcanic activity and have never been inhabited by man			1
taking advantage of their isolation , in the early 1900s the @entity8 government used them to conduct military testing			1
@entity5 : this secret crescent , only accessible if you swim through a cave , is an ' idyllic bombsite ' a crater bombed into one of the islands has created the pristine @entity5 , a secret crescent of sand that you can only access by swimming through a cave			1
as i breast - stroke through this dark tunnel , my guide tells me to keep my face in the water so the tide does not buoy me up and bash my skull into the rock ceiling			2
this is not the most relaxing way to start a day of sunbathing			2
but i am at peace as soon as i ’m out of the cave , with nothing to do except lie on the sand and enjoy the warm ocean waters lapping at my feet			2
it really is a private paradise			2
i would n’t be surprised if @entity52 and @entity53 made it here during their recent second honeymoon in @entity57 , an exclusive vacation enclave close by			2
thankfully , there is no danger of any bombs whistling overhead nowadays			2
the islands were declared a national park in the 1960s , thanks to the efforts of @entity66 , who found them rich in marine life such as sea turtles , humpback whales and dolphins			2
colourful : @entity6 offers a more traditional slice of @entity8 life than its rowdier counterparts laid back vibe : people walk the streets barefoot and families crowd the @entity80 at sunset until recently , @entity6 , this marvel of @entity8 ’s @entity83 , was near inaccessible for @entity85 visitors , found only at the end of various connecting flights and dreary layovers			1
but now , with the long - haul flying range of the @entity90 , @entity6 is just a 12 - hour direct flight from @entity92 or @entity93			1
the town itself is a smart resort long popular with @entity97 and @entity98			1
it offers a more traditional slice of @entity8 life than its rowdier counterparts on the @entity102 ( that would be you , @entity105 )			1
celebrity hotspot : @entity52 and @entity53 honeymooned on the @entity107 in june @entity110 , white - washed houses with terracotta - tiled rooftops are backed by green , palm - packed mountains , their slopes free of development			2
in front , @entity114 is an arc of cerulean sea and golden shoreline , dotted with beachfront hotels			2
a stroll along the @entity121 ( seafront promenade ) takes me past laid - back scenes of everyday life			2
@entity8 is often portrayed as an anarchic warzone populated by drug lords ( thank you , @entity129 )			1
but the sight of two tourist police dressed in crisp - white shorts and t - shirts , relaxedly riding segways , reassures me there ’s not much trouble for them to attend to in this town			2
young local men walk the streets barefoot , such is the warm , holiday vibe			1
families crowd the @entity80 at sunset			2
on sundays , you can even catch the townspeople dancing to traditional music in the main square , @entity148			0
pool crazy : @entity150 is a new resort with an adults - only policy - and a lot of swimming pools view from the lobby : you can gaze out onto swaying palms and crashing waves i ’m staying a ten - minute drive from @entity110 at the beachfront @entity150 , a new resort with an adults - only policy			1
guests range from twenty - to sixty - somethings , all smooching couples or grinning groups of friends , with as many six - pack - toting , board - short - clad young @entity97 as there are older , deeply bronzed @entity165 ( they ’ve obviously been quick to book those new flights )			1
the hotel lobby lacks a fourth wall , so you can gaze right out onto the swaying palms and crashing waves			0
rooms are huge and come with deep baths that turn into hot tubs at the flick of a switch			0
it seems too slick to be all - inclusive , but it is			0
premium drinks flow freely , room service and mini bar carry no extra charge , and you can eat with abandon at any of the eight restaurants ( my favourite is the breakfast buffet , where i load up every morning on freshly made guacamole , washed down with a mimosa , naturally )			0
there seems to be a wedding by romantic sunset on the beach every night			0
it all sounds too luxurious to leave , and many do n’t , spending their fortnight in the myriad swimming pools and getting pampered in the spa			0
there are a few tours i would highly recommend , though , if you can lift yourself from your lounger			0
one is to the @entity5 in the @entity210			0
another , run by local operator @entity212 , promises to show me ‘ @entity213 ’ , and i spend the day walking the cobbled streets of quiet , colourful villages and studying petroglyphs - rock engravings left by the @entity218			0
trips worth trying : local operator @entity212 shows travellers ' hidden @entity8 ' , including rock engravings left by the @entity218 ( right ) , and a tequila distillery where the size of agave pods ( left ) surprised @entity225 thirsty : @entity225 tries a very large @entity8 @entity227 at the end of the tour , i visit a tequila distillery , and am surprised at the size of the agave – the plant tequila is made from			1
they look like enormous pine cones			0
the man who conducts my tequila tasting is almost certainly drunk , insisting on matching me shot for shot ( i am a member of only one of several tour groups to pass through that day )			0
most @entity8 you meet will extol the virtues of their various types of tequila – some are for sipping , others for mixing – and will probably tell you that @entity247 , the golden - coloured brand that stocks the shelves in the @entity85 , is underwhelming			1
i also learn that the worm at the bottom of the tequila bottle is fallacy			0
the ‘ worm ’ is actually found in mescal – similar to tequila but made from a different type of agave – and is in fact the larva of a moth			0
at the end of my trip , i decide to head a 45 - minute drive north of @entity6 to @entity107 , a 200 - mile stretch of coastline that caters to a rather upmarket clientele			1
think ocean - side golf courses , a @entity268 , and so on			0
this is the area where @entity52 and @entity53 holed up in june			0
i want to check out the @entity107 ’s ‘ hippy chic ’ town @entity270 - once a sleepy fishing village but now the kind of affluent hipster haven that draws any number and range of travellers			1
@entity280 beach babe : @entity225 tries her hand at surfing off the ' hippy chic ' town of @entity270 i must admit that i ’m won over			0
there is just the right balance here of easygoing authenticity ( cheap taco stands , fresh fish sizzling on streetside grills , studiously tatty beachfront bungalows ) and vogue - ish scene ( not - cheap souvenir shops , surf schools teaching the sexy and wealthy how to be at one with the @entity8 waves )			1
i spend the morning surfing among the tanned totty and seriously consider converting to a life of boho beach babedom for the rest of my days			0
but if posing with beautiful beach bums is n’t your thing , remember @entity6 is just around the corner			1
this is what is so great about this part of the @entity83			1
whether you ’re after adventure or pure repose , tradition or ‘ a scene ’ , they are all within a few minutes of each other in @entity8 ’s hottest holiday haven			1
two weeks at @entity150 with @entity316 costs from around £ 2,025 per person , on an all - inclusive basis , including return flights from @entity320			1
visit www.thomson.co.uk surf lessons with @entity323 , on the main beach in @entity270 , cost from $ 40 ( £ 24 ) per person for 1.5 hours			0
@entity326 where to stay : budget : @entity329 offers roomy self - catering apartments in @entity6 , plus a private beach with snorkelling , kayaking and paddleboarding available			1
from $ 86 ( £ 52 ) per night			0
@entity334 midrange : secrets @entity150 is a glam , adults - only five - star and an all - inclusive bargain ( see @entity316 package )			0
@entity342 luxury : the @entity268 in @entity57 , an exclusive vacation enclave on @entity107 , is a haven of in seafront luxury			0
there ’s a yacht for hire , two private beaches , two @entity351 - designed golf courses and 120 tequilas on offer			0
from @entity97 $ 482 ( £ 291 ) per night			0

@entity6 is a popular holiday resort on the @entity83 of @entity8
traditionally inaccessible for @entity85 , but is now in range with direct flights
the @entity0 , directly to the west , were once used for test bombings
