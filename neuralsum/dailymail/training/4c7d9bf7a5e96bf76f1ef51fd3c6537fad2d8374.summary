by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 10 october 2012 scientists performing ct scans on the head of an @entity5 mummy say they have found one of the worst cases of dental problems ever seen - an a unique treatment to try and treat it			1
researchers ct scanning a 2,100 year old mummy were stunned to find evidence of a sinus infection caused by a mouthful of cavities and other tooth problems			1
the also came across a unique find - a cavity filled with linen			1
researchers used a ct scanner to see inside the man 's mouth , and created a 3d reconstruction showing the worn incisors using a piece of linen , which may have first been dipped in a medicine such as fig juice or cedar oil , a form of ' packing ' in the biggest and most painful cavity , located on the left side of his jaw between the first and second molars , was inserted			1
this acted as a barrier to prevent food particles from getting into the cavity , with any medicine on the linen helping to ease the pain , the study researchers said			1
the man , whose name is unknown , was in his 20s or early 30s , and lived at a time when @entity5 was ruled by a dynasty of @entity51 kings			2
@entity53 , at the @entity52 , used new high - resolution ct scans of his teeth and body , according to the @entity57 of @entity58			0
researchers said this is the first known case of such packing treatment done on an ancient @entity5			2
' the dental treatment , filling a large inter-proximal cavity [ a cavity between two teeth ] with a protective , likely medicine - laden , barrier is a unique example of dental intervention in ancient @entity5 , ' the team writes in their journal article			1
' the dental packing described here is unique among ancient @entity5 mummies studied to date , and represents one of only a few recorded dental interventions in ancient @entity5			2
ct scans of the entire mouth were carried out to allow the researchers to recreate a 3d version			2
the linen filling can be be seen on the right of the mouth dentistry was relatively commonplace in @entity5 , and records indicate that it was being practiced at least as far back as when the @entity85 were built			1
however , this finding has led researchers to believe experts may have practiced advanced techniques			1
dental problems were not unusual , as the coarsely ground grain ancient @entity5 consumed was not good for the teeth			0
the team say the find add weight to the theory that dentists were commonplace in @entity5			0
' such a finding lends further support for the existence of a group of dental specialists practicing interventional medicine in ancient @entity5			1
' while the physical evidence , to date for other interventions , may be scarce , the findings presented here should underline the need to continue to look for evidence of dental packing as well as other therapeutic dental interventions in the ancient world			0
' the small linen mass was initially found during a scan in the mid- 1990s , but the scanning resolution of the time was too low to allow a full analysis			1
the high - resolution scanner his team used for their latest study was six times as powerful			0
the young wealthy man from @entity124 was nearing the end of his life when his dental problem hit , researchers believe			1
the man , whose name is unknown , was in his 20s or early 30s , and had ' numerous ' abscesses and cavities , conditions that appear to have resulted , at some point , in a sinus infection , something potentially deadly , the study researchers said , although they could not pinpoint his cause of death			2
the 3d reconstruction was made from data collected during high resolution ct scans of the mummy			0
when he died he was mummified , his brain and many of his organs taken out , resin put in and his body wrapped			0
embalmers left his heart inside the body , a sign perhaps of his elite status , researchers say			2
after being mummified he was likely put in a coffin and given funerary rites befitting someone of his wealth and stature			0
where he was laid to rest in @entity124 is n't known , as his body was not seen again until 1859 when @entity161 , a businessman and politician , brought the mummified body ( the whereabouts of the coffin is unknown ) to @entity166 , where today it lies in the @entity168 at @entity169			2
experts say the pain the young man suffered would have been excruciating , and say his problems would have been a ' serious health risk ' for modern dentists			1
despite the help , he succumbed shortly after , perhaps in just a matter of weeks			0
dentistry was nothing new in @entity5 , ancient records indicate that it was being practiced at least as far back as when the @entity85 were built			0
dental problems were also not unusual , the coarsely ground grain ancient @entity5 consumed was not good for the teeth			0
ct scans allowed the team to examine the filling in far greater detail than ever before			0
@entity188 slices showing the wear of the left first ( left ) and second right ( right ) incisors of the mummy			0

experts believe man from @entity124 died in excruciating pain
researchers found linen ' filling ' dipped in medicine inside infected tooth
say find could prove that dental experts were constantly trying new techniques
