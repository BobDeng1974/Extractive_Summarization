by @entity0 ever heard your doorbell go , dropped what you 're doing rushed downstairs to open the door , only to find it ’s an unwanted visitor ? that ’s a scenario one @entity9 - based company hopes will be a thing of the past with their @entity13 technology , a @entity15 video doorbell that can connect with your smartphone or tablet			1
by using a camera and connecting to the internet , the device will let you know who is at your door even if you ’re out and about at work , the shops or elsewhere			2
this can be synced to a smartphone , tablet or pc across multiple platforms and , when the bell is rung , the homeowner can see who is at their door and speak to them through their phone to use the @entity13 , which is currently part of a @entity50 campaign to raise £ 30,000 ( $ 50,000 ) , it is installed on your door like a normal bell and sits at face level			1
size : 110 x 60 x 22mm ( 3.9 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches ) weight : 320 grams ( 0.7 pounds ) camera quality : 1080p hd camera field of view : 180 ° @entity15 enabled : yes battery : @entity61 rechargeable lithium @entity63 audio speaker and microphone video : one - way ( homeowner to visitor ) other features : cloud storage , @entity71 on the front is a button for visitors to activate the bell , and also a camera at the top			1
when a visitor presses the button the camera springs to life and calls the device it is synced with , which can be any @entity86 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 smartphone or tablet , and also any pc			1
you can then choose to ' answer ' the call with your chosen device and then speak to the person on their doorstep			2
if it 's a delivery , for example , the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour			0
or if it 's a guest but you 're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you somewhere			0
the camera is n't two - way though , so the visitor wo n't be able to see you			0
when it is released later this year , possibly november , the product will retail for £ 179.50 ( $ 307 )			1
the @entity13 uses a 1080p hd camera and communicates with the guest via a built - in speaker and microphone			1
@entity13 also allows users to screen their visitors , so they can choose whether or not to answer the door to a cold - calling salesman or an unwanted guest on the doorstep			1
when someone is at the door you can chose to ' answer ' the call with your chosen device ( shown ) and then speak to the person on their doorstep			2
if it 's a delivery , for example , the visitor could be asked to go drop it with a neighbour			0
or if it 's a guest but you 're out of the house they could be asked to come and meet you high - security brackets help to keep the gadget safe and secured to the front door , and the @entity13 can be connected to from any synced device anywhere in the world			1
if you miss a call , the digital doorbell will also be able to take a picture , using the cloud to store images of people calling at your door to be checked later , while it can also record audio in the form of a voicemail			0
' there ’s nothing quite like @entity13 on the market right now , ' said @entity152 , co-founder of the company			2
' it ’s going to revolutionise daily life for a lot of individuals and businesses			0
' arranging deliveries around working hours or getting an unexpected visit from a relative who gets no answer at the door can really disrupt an individual ’s plans			0
' but now it ’s possible to communicate directly with the person ringing the doorbell , let the postman know where to leave a package , or tell @entity172 that you ’ll be home as soon as possible without even being on the premises			0
' fun to use and practical , @entity176 makes it possible to answer the door from any corner of the world , whether that ’s five minutes down the road on the school run or from a sun lounger overseas on a long awaited holiday			0
