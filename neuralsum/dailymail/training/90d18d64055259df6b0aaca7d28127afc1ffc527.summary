the @entity9 champions have not been beaten at home in the @entity11 since 2004 and their record continued in a five - goal thriller			2
@entity4 took the lead on 11 minutes and it was @entity0 – a player linked with a move to @entity2 before he finally left @entity17 for @entity7 in the summer – who got the goal			1
@entity20 was penalized for handball and @entity23 ’s free - kick dropped to @entity0 who swept it past @entity25			0
@entity0 wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity4 's opening goal in the 3 - 2 victory over @entity2 looking every bit a rock star , @entity0 executes the perfect celebratory power slide after scoring the opener in @entity4 's win over @entity2 @entity4 : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity0 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 71 ' ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity23 ( @entity43 91 ' ) , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 86 ' ) subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 goals : @entity0 , @entity39 , @entity42 booked : @entity36 , @entity39 , @entity42 @entity2 : @entity25 , @entity20 ( @entity53 83 ' ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 ' ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 ' ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			1
goals : @entity61 , @entity62 booked : @entity20 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) @entity2 had made enquiries to sign @entity0 in the past and made a more concerted effort to sign @entity37			1
they were facing both players and it was @entity0 who had put paid to perfect defensive record			0
within a minute , however , the visitors were level			0
the luminous yellow shirts charged forward and @entity61 and @entity60 played a wall pass inside the area with the @entity85 finishing past @entity86 for his 68th @entity11 goal			1
now only @entity89 ’s @entity88 has scored more and @entity61 had moved within three of the record			2
it was also @entity2 ’s 500th goal in the @entity11			2
@entity61 created @entity2 ’s next real chance with a lofted pass that @entity62 stretched to reach ahead of @entity95 - he got there first but failed to keep this shot down			1
from so nearly taking the lead , @entity2 were soon behind again			0
@entity56 lost possession , @entity4 won a corner and from @entity41 ’s kick @entity39 scored at the far post			1
it a owed plenty to fine delivery , but even more to @entity25 wandering off his line and failing to claim the ball as it sailed over his head it , leaving the goal at @entity39 ’s mercy			2
the old demons of not being able to defend set - pieces had undone @entity2 , with them conceding from a free - kick and a corner			0
the game remained ridiculously open in what was left of the first half – something that suited @entity0			0
the @entity119 exists somewhere between total football and total chaos			0
he had one run down the right wing , one run down the left wing , and there was some kamikaze defending , but he had scored one of the goals that sent his team down the tunnel leading 2 - 1 at half time			0
@entity0 takes a brilliant first touch in the box before turning and driving home his left - footed finish to give @entity4 the lead over @entity2 former @entity17 defender @entity0 's goal comes after 10 minutes in @entity4 's @entity138 fixture at the @entity139 in @entity7 luiz wheels away in celebration after scoring the emphatic goal that gave the hosts a 1 - 0 lead @entity0 , who has been underfire recently due to poor form following his big money move to @entity7 , races to the corner after his goal to celebrate with the @entity4 fans raising his arms to the heavens , @entity0 completes the post-goal celebrations with his @entity4 team - mates @entity4 's @entity38 ( right ) takes to the air after he is fouled by @entity2 's @entity156 former @entity9 president @entity157 smiles as he takes his seat in the star - studded stands imperious @entity160 10 @entity61 turns @entity4 's @entity162 midfielder @entity41 ( centre ) inside out with another of his probing runs within two minutes of @entity0 's goal @entity61 is taking on celebrations of his own after a beautiful piece of interplay with @entity60 @entity61 ( right ) forms a superstar huddle with @entity60 ( front ) and @entity62 ( second right ) after their 12th - minute equaliser the open spaces brought more goals at the start of the second half			1
@entity4 were doubling up on @entity178 with @entity23 and @entity179 down the @entity2 left and the home side ’s full back crossed from the right for @entity42 to score the third			1
@entity2 repeated their first half trick of responding inside a minute with @entity20 ’ cross was converted by @entity62 to make it 3 - 2			1
@entity2 were still looking exposed at the back and both @entity44 and @entity45 had the chance to extend @entity4 ’s lead			2
a watching @entity189 did n’t know whether to smile or scowl as he watched the team attack so well without him			0
@entity4 take the lead back through re back in the lead @entity39 ( right ) as the @entity162 gets on the end of a corner to the far post @entity2 keeper @entity25 is all at sea as the corner loops over and around his defenders and finds @entity39 's head @entity162 striker @entity39 celebrates as the score moves to 2 - 1 at the @entity139 not just a star striker , @entity44 ( right ) puts in the hard yards to get between @entity60 and the ball in the penalty area @entity2 's @entity62 comes in for some rough treatment from @entity4 's @entity207 on the sideline @entity2 coach @entity6 brought on @entity209 for his 143rd @entity11 appearance , sending him past @entity88 ’s competiton record , as @entity156 , who had also been at fault for @entity4 ’s second goal , beaten in the air by @entity39 , made way			1
@entity2 ’s best chance to salvage a point came with 15 minutes left when the ball dropped to @entity60 in space on the edge of the area			2
it was the same range he scored his most famous @entity11 goal at @entity225 in 2009			0
he even had the same colour shirt on but the shot was high and wide and the clock was now ticking down on @entity2 ’s unbeaten start to the season			0
there were still two more big chances with @entity178 shooting from inside the area only for @entity37 to throw himself in front of the goalbound effort and @entity2 substitute @entity237 to hit the post from distance			0
@entity37 celebrated his block as if it were a goal , and @entity4 had their victory			0
