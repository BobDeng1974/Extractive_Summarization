by @entity0 i had a caesarean section 27 years ago – and still have a small bulge over the top of the scar , which seems to hang over the waistband of my size eight trousers			1
it ’s not the @entity10 but it does bother me			1
i ’m 58 now , can you recommend any exercises that will help ? i suspect you ’re not alone in your problem			1
these days roughly a quarter of all births are by caesarean , making it one of the most common of all surgical scars			1
healing movements : @entity20 is a good way of targeting the stomach , if that is your problem area ( stock image ) women who have this operation find that afterwards fat deposits unevenly over the front abdominals – perhaps because of the way the tissues are cut and then heal – and this can be difficult to get rid of			1
it must be frustrating for you because , as a size eight , you ’re obviously slim elsewhere			1
it does n’t sound like you need to lose weight , so going on a diet to reduce your overall body fat percentage probably wo n’t help			1
in terms of exercise , you do n’t give any clues about what you ’re doing already , but any workout that targets the core muscles should be your first port of call			1
@entity20 is specifically designed to target this area , with the majority of the moves focused on engaging the core muscle group			1
fit in the @entity52 columnist @entity51 recommends ' any workout that targets the core muscles ' for those suffering from c - section fat deposits ( stock image ) although it ’s very hard to reduce fat in a specific area , by improving muscle tone and posture , you might find your tummy ’s appearance does get better			1
you could see if there ’s a studio or class you can get to locally , but working one - to - one with an instructor in your own home will probably yield faster results			1
it ’s not as expensive as you might think – take a look on @entity72			1
given your age and that you had your surgery some time ago , it could be that the bulge is mainly sagging skin due to a loss of elasticity			1
a while ago , the only option might have been a mini tummy tuck			1
it ’s an increasingly popular option but i ’m ambivalent about cosmetic surgery			1
it ’s a major operation with a host of risks and a lengthy recovery time , even though the surgeon might be able to use the same incision point as your caesarean , meaning no further scarring			2
today there are a wealth of non-invasive options that use ultrasound , radio frequency , heat and freezing among other things to tighten skin and spot reduce fat			2
they do work but again there are risks and you really do need to do your homework			2
if you take this route , make sure you visit a qualified and experienced therapist , and not just some hairdresser who has decided to buy a fat - zapper machine			2
go nuts : almonds and other nuts and seeds could help with oestrogen production your recent response to one reader ’s battle - of - the - bulge question , in which you suggested she increase her intake of foods that move excess oestrogen through the system , was really interesting			2
but are there any oestrogen - stimulating foods to avoid ? this is a great question , as there ’s some confusion around the idea that cruciferous vegetables – such as cabbage , cauliflower and sprouts – and citrus fruits , avocado , nuts , eggs , organic dairy products ( and tea and coffee ) have ‘ anti- oestrogen ’ properties			2
i spoke to the @entity144 - based nutritionist @entity143 for an expert opinion on this , and she had some different ideas			2
the key thing is to limit saturated fats , such as red meat or cheese			2
high levels of saturated fat in your diet can block the action of the essential fats such as omega 3 , which play a key role in hormone balance			2
these produce anti-inflammatory prostaglandins and can help relieve symptoms of oestrogen - dominant conditions such as heavy or painful periods , or endometriosis			0
so replacing saturated fats with foods rich in essential fats such as raw almonds , walnuts , pumpkin or flax seed and oily fish , could combat the effects of excess oestrogen			0
@entity143 also told me that foods containing plant compounds called isoflavones are considered to have hormone balancing properties – think lentils , chickpeas , beans and soya			0
eating organic where possible , will also reduce exposure to xenoestrogens – oestrogen - like chemicals which may be found in pesticides or plastics , for example			0
cruciferous vegetables contain indole - 3 - carbinol , which helps to encourage the elimination of excess oestrogen , though @entity143 says she generally does n’t advocate tea or coffee , despite the potential antioxidant content , as they can deplete vitamins and minerals which may affect hormone balance and impact blood sugar levels			0
this generates the release of stress hormones , which , when out of balance , can impact the balance of other hormones in the body			1
looking for some motivation to go the extra mile in your workout – why not take the dog with you ? we reported last month that @entity217 ( @entity218 ) is the fastest growing watersport in the world			0
one newly revealed fan is @entity222 ! actress @entity223 , who has been taking her @entity225 @entity224 out on the water with her			0
she posted this picture , right , on @entity228 last week , along with the caption : ‘ it was surprising , at first , that @entity224 was so eager to jump aboard			0
now i ca n’t enjoy paddling without him			0
’ fun with @entity224 : actress @entity223 had her dog @entity224 join her on the paddleboard for her water workout from the look on her face – and his – they ’re having a whale of a time			0
in @entity241 i see people running with their dogs every day			1
they live in such tiny apartments , they need all the exercise they can get – but it works both ways			0
research by the @entity250 has shown that more than a third of dogs in the @entity253 are overweight – and their owners are likely to be less fit too			0
so , if you are looking at @entity257 thinking perhaps he could lose a couple of pounds , he might be thinking the same about you … the latest craze in fitness - mad @entity241 ? @entity261 – that is , a specially designed treadmill workout that combines intervals of varying speed and incline with brief recovery periods			1
personally , i ’m not a fan of running – i get bored too quickly – but when i attended a class at my local @entity270 the time flew past , with the instructor constantly changing the pace and intensity			0
interval running used to be the domain of elite athletes , but as some studies suggest it helps burn more calories in a shorter time period , as well as improve cardiovascular function faster than continuous - intensity exercise , it ’s no wonder it ’s becoming more popular			0
to try it out for yourself , after a warm - up run hard for two minutes so you get very out of breath , followed by two to three minutes of easy jogging or fast walking			0
the secret is actually in the recovery , as this is what allows you to really go for it in the next hard interval – but it still takes some discipline to push yourself to your limit			0
this is where classes come in , as it helps to have somebody telling you how fast and high to set your treadmill			0
i was amazed what i could do when i took myself out of my running comfort zone for once .			0
