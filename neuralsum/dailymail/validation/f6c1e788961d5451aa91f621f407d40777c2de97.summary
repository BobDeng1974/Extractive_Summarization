' the ability to go up hills or mountains and snowboard down or just legitimately fly off them is the most amazing feeling , ' he said			2
' i have had an incredible amount of adventures and small world experiences , ' he continued			2
' i 'm 26 and doing my best to live the happiest , most adventurous life possible			2

the sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along the snow or ice champion snow kite boarder , @entity70 , knows a thing or two about gathering high speeds with the help of the kite this year , the competition was held on the frozen waters of the @entity29 , where a @entity7 photographer captured it all among the participants was 26 - year - old @entity35 , an extreme sports enthusiast , from @entity37 in the @entity81 for @entity53 , his introduction to the sport began in his home state , back in 2011 , when he asked to hitchhike a ride to a local mountain the daredevil athlete wound up meeting a surfer from @entity89 who introduced him to the weird and wonderful world of snow kite boarding @entity35 describes the feeling of being able to go up mountains and legitimately ' fly ' off of them as ' the most amazing feeling ' ' i was just looking for an adventure when this kid from @entity89 picked me up as he was headed to the same mountain			1
' we ended up riding together for the day			2
later in the afternoon , he asked if i wanted to try kiteboarding			0
' though @entity35 had only seen the sport on the internet , he thought it just might be something that he would love			0
' from that day on , i knew it was something i was going to pursue with a passion			0
' @entity35 's passion for the mountains has not only fueled his love for the extreme sport , but also has helped repair family ties			0
after taking a ski patrol course the following summer , @entity35 took his mother , a former drug addict and alcoholic , rock climbing			0
' this showed her that she could experience happiness without being high , ' he explained			0
' she got sober and i went to @entity121 to ski patrol			0
' ever since 2011 , @entity53 has been pursuing snowkiting with a passion , even going so far as to become qualified in ski patrol among some of the stranger sights captured by @entity7 photographer , @entity30 , was a snow kite boarder in full bear costume while @entity35 - and the other competitors - love the rush associated with snowkiting , they do admit that the sport can be dangerous @entity137 kites are n't designed for heights of more than about 300 feet , so competitors must remain be aware of how high they ' fly ' into the air at high altitudes , there is always a possibility that the kites may fail - but @entity35 still does n't regret any part of his snowkiting journey @entity70 , who hails from @entity146 , shows off her massive , lightweight kite , which sticks out noticeably among the expanse of white snow eight competitors , pictured here , move in impressive sync as they hold on to the brightly coloured contraptions supporting them after seeing his family life turn around , @entity35 's focus is now on his snowkiting career fueled by an overriding ambition to compete professionally			1
' the last snowkiting trip i went on has to be the most dangerous thing i 've ever done , ' he recalled			0
' at some points , i was over 300 feet off the ground and kites are n't really designed for that kind of height , so if one part of the system failed i could have died			1
' still , he does n't regret a moment			0
' it 's what i love			0
i 'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level , ' he added			1
