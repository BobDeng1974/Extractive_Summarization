by @entity0 surgery : @entity3 hospitals have reported a five-fold increase in labiaplasty in recent years the debate surrounding labiaplasty has always been a contentious one			1
is surgery to give you a ' designer vagina ' a tool for female empowerment or an extreme example of women becoming the victims of an increasingly x-rated world ? with @entity3 hospitals reporting a five-fold increase in patients opting to undergo labia surgery - and some girls as young as 11 expressing interest - a research charity has released an animated film to explain the subject			1
in the @entity28 's @entity27 , documentary filmmaker @entity26 focuses on three women who have undergone the surgery			2
each woman had a different reason for opting to have the procedure - which involves ' neatening - up ' the genital area through cutting and stitching - and each explains how she felt with the results			2
the first interviewee talks about how she used to feel like a ' freak ' because of her long labia , and that she repeatedly dreamed they were a ' long , long scarf ' wrapped tightly around her neck that everyone was staring and laughing at			2
the second divulges that her own large labia were not only unlike those of other women , but that they affected her sex life because of ' mobility issues ' and that ' they would get in the way '			2
the women talk about spending hours flicking through porn magazines trying to find women with similar labia , but never managing			2
one woman confesses that although her motivation for the surgery was ' aesthetic ' , not a day went by when she did n't think about her vagina ' in a bad way ' , and that she did n't look ' the way women were meant to look '			0
another says : ' the labia would rub and cause me a lot of pain - sometimes i even had little blisters			0
' @entity26 also interviews the women after the procedures , and each explains how the surgery has affected their lives both positively and negatively			0
speaking to @entity87 about her animated film , @entity26 said : ' the focus of the film is to present a balanced view of labiaplasty , while reflecting the anxieties and concerns the women interviewed share about their labia			1
' the film comments on some of the cultural factors that could be driving women 's anxieties about their genitals , such as advertising , pornography and consumerism			0
some of the interviewed women had physical problems with their genitals and so we find that women 's reasons for surgery is a complex issue			0
' am i normal ? a still from @entity26 's animated documentary which explores labiaplasty @entity118 surgery costs over Â£ 3,000 if done privately , but 2,000 labiaplasties were carried out by the @entity120 last year , a fivefold increase on the last five years			1
to be eligible for the surgery on the @entity120 , a woman must have physical reasons which include pain during intercourse , discomfort due to rubbing clothes , rare hormonal disorders causing the labia minora to enlarge and damage done after giving birth			0
it is also possible to get a labiaplasty on the @entity120 in the absence of physical medical problems			1
if the size or shape of your labia are causing you real psychological damage - such as depression or self - esteem problems - women can be assessed by a gp to determine the need for labiaplasty and then referred to a gynaecologist			1
speaking to the @entity150 , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity149 said she sees patients as young as 11 , and is surprised by what she believes is a new phenomenon			1
a second film available on the @entity156 website which addresses recent research into labia surgery			0
this film highlights the possible dangers that labia surgery could present , because it is unknown what lasting effects the surgery may have			0
