by @entity0 a @entity2 based taxidermist has given a new meaning to the phrase drop dead gorgeous with her range of animal corpse fascinators			1
the one of a kind accessories are designed by @entity9 and are created using stuffed , dead animals such as mice and birds			1
the 31 - year - old from @entity14 took up the hobby three years ago , creating pieces for herself and friends but has since seen the business gain popularity and now sells the accessories for around £ 60 a piece			1
@entity9 creates unique fascinators using dead stuffed animals far from being run of the mill , most pieces are specially commissioned by @entity27 's clients guaranteeing that they will not suffer the embarrassment of matching outfits at a wedding			1
despite the unusual method that goes into the making of the pieces @entity27 says that it is the unique materials that attracts her clientele , ' they ask me to make something for a wedding or events , or just for fun as i am very creative and i tend to use different techniques and materials ' says @entity27 who adds that , for her , taxidermy was an obvious fashion choice			2
she says that birds in particular capture her imagination when creating the unique head pieces			0
@entity27 's favourite animal to work with is a bird as she says the wings have amazing colours ' taxidermy just made sense to me as something you might wear on your head or just on your person			1
' i love birds and wanted to incorporate unused bits of the ones i found dead on the ground as roadkill			2
' i thought that as a fashion statement it was unique as each bird wing is shaped differently depending on the bird type , and i love the asymmetry and pointy yet smooth edges the feathers create			0
' i think birds are just stunning , especially when you are close enough to see the fine detail and colour			0
many people think a crow wing is just black , but there is so much more spectrum to the colour and all birds have this			0
' @entity27 has seen popularity rise in the art of taxidermy and has since started teaching her own classes in her classes @entity27 teaches students how to gut , stuff and pose mice into their ' cutest ' positions @entity27 says that she never has trouble selling any of her macabre pieces and has gone from selling exclusively online to working with individual commissions			1
' usually if i make a batch and put them online , they sell very very fast			0
however i have recently starting just taking commissions			0
' it is more personalised and i think people enjoy experiencing the creative process with me ie choosing colours , fabric , and sourcing particular birds			0
' @entity27 says she does receive abuse for her work but insists that she never kills an animal purposefully for her work since starting her businesses , the quirky designer has seen the interest in taxidermy grow and has started teaching a range of taxidermy classes across @entity2			1
in the sessions @entity27 teaches her students how to gut , clean , stuff and pose mice , birds and small mammals in a variety of positions			0
@entity27 first started selling her unusual accessories to friends who wanted something a bit different for special occasions @entity27 sells her head pieces for around £ 60 each both online and through privately commissioned pieces @entity27 's classes have proved extremely popular and she has since extended her tutoring to private classes where clients can specialise in guinea pigs , rabbits , hamsters as well as the usual birds			1
@entity27 says that despite the popularity of her work she does recieve some abuse for her controversial fashion statements			2
@entity27 says that when she makes a batch of accessories they sell out extremely quickly ' sometimes i do get negative reactions , i get people telling me they think it is absolutely appalling , cruel or disrespectful			2
' but i do n't kill anything purposefully for taxidermy , so i do n't have any issues with it			1
' there will always be people who think it is distasteful or who are against it - but each to their own			0
' for @entity27 it makes perfect sense to use taxidermy as a fashion accessory			0
