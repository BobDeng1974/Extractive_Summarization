a stray kitten that spent a year recuperating with an animal rescue group after getting plucked from the streets of a flood - ravaged section of @entity8 has finally been adopted - by a fellow @entity10 refugee			1
the little white cat , named @entity12 , was the last of nearly 300 stray and displaced pets that wound up in an @entity15 shelter after the storm			1
lucky : joy the cat ( pictured with an @entity15 worker ) has been adopted by @entity19 from @entity8 , @entity20 this week , she was getting used to her new home with @entity19 , whose home and family business on @entity20 's @entity25 were also partially destroyed			1
@entity19 said he reached out to the @entity15 after @entity1 wrote about the group 's attempt to find @entity12 a permanent home			1
' she looked like she just needed some love and affection and a happy place to be , ' said @entity19			2
' i said , ' you know what ? i 'm rebuilding my life			0
this cat needs help too '			0
' @entity12 was probably about six - months - old when she was found , skinny and skittish , on the streets of @entity8 's @entity41 section last november			1
after the emergency shelter closed , she lived at the @entity15 's offices in @entity44			1
the organization did n't initially put her up for adoption because she was initially terrified around people			0
by the storm 's anniversary last month , she was playful and eating treats out of people 's hands			1
meanwhile , @entity19 relocated from the @entity54 seashore to @entity8 after @entity10 's tidal surge pushed several feet of water into the @entity57 , which his family has owned for decades			1
his apartment , above the bar , lost its heating and electrical systems			0
the place still has n't reopened , and @entity19 said he does n't know if it ever will			2
' we 're dealing with insurance issues			0
we 're dealing with the future of the block , ' he said			0
' remember , you 're talking about putting an entertainment business back in an area where everyone lost their life savings ... who has money to go out on a friday night ? ' still , @entity19 's a survivor			2
and , so far , @entity12 has proven to be one , too			2
' she 's adorable , ' he said , adding that the transition has gone smoother than expected			2
' i expected not to see her for two weeks			0
but she 's been fine			0
