by @entity0 published : 20:58 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 26 march 2013 with a young leader trying to assert his authority , mounting international tension and a growing army trying to establish itself as a military force to be reckoned with , life in @entity2 at the end of the 19th century would probably not sound all that alien to the inhabitants of at least one half of the former empire today			1
but far from the acrimoniously divided pair of states we know now , @entity2 was still a vast single sovereignty			1
and instead of threatening global powers with aggressive threats of martial action - as in @entity2 's case today - the nation , known until 1897 as @entity23 , was desperately trying not to be bullied in a power struggle between @entity25 and @entity26			1
this fascinating set of pictures gives a rare glimpse into life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in @entity2 - a time of great change for the state			1
defences : @entity35 , pictured , is one of the @entity36 in the @entity37 of @entity38 which surrounded the city in the @entity23			0
the image is one of a series which give a fascinating insight into @entity45 life more than a century ago taking a breather : a western man sits with his straw boater on the grass on a visit to one the @entity51 of the @entity23 scattered across 18 locations in @entity2 resting place of the kings : a @entity45 man strolls in the sunshine at one of the @entity51 of the @entity23 traditional dress : a young child , left , and a woman , right , show what traditional @entity45 dress looked like at the turn of the @entity64 the pictures show iconic palaces and fortresses of the soon to be ousted @entity23 dynasty , including the @entity70 - first constructed in 1395 , later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries , and then reconstructed in 1867 - the main and largest palace of the @entity73 built by the dynasty			1
@entity2 are pictured walking among the final resting place of the kings , the @entity51 of @entity23 's answer to the @entity78 - and peddler merchants trying to sell their wares			1
of particular note , are early pictures of several of a series of eight gates which were part of a fortress wall which surrounded the city of @entity38 during the @entity23 rule , including the stunning @entity35 - which is undergoing resotration work following an arson in 2008 - pictured complete with its historic 24 - hour market			1
in one picture , the @entity45 class system is illustrated - at one stage during @entity23 rule , a third of the population were said to be slaves			2
grand : the @entity70 royal palace in @entity38 was first constructed in 1395 , later burned and abandoned for almost three centuries , and then reconstructed in 1867 , it was the main and largest palace of the @entity73 built by the @entity23 trading place : the historic 24 - hour @entity35 market is located next to this 14th century gate , one of eight surrounding @entity38 play time : @entity45 children climb on a statue outside one of @entity2 's grand palaces taken in 1904 in @entity112 , a woman of the upper class of old @entity2 is pictured riding in a ' kama '			1
the palanquin is carried by the two men in the background			0
a lady 's personal maidservant follows the palanquin on foot			0
the class system was banned in 1894 the pictures illustrate a great turning point in @entity45 history			2
at the tail end of the 19th century , @entity2 had been in the grip of the @entity23 for 500 years - formed following a largely bloodless coup by general @entity131 in 1392			1
the dynasty had survived intact a bloody invasion by the @entity26 in the late 16th century , which saw invading warriors take around 200,000 noses cut from @entity45 's faces back to their homeland as souvenirs following defeat , and numerous attempts at a coup by the @entity142			1
the @entity23 dynasty ruled @entity2 for just over five centuries			1
it was founded when the @entity145 was overthrown in what is now the city of @entity148			0
the dynasty was the last of @entity45 history and the longest - ruling @entity153 reign			2
during its long reign , the dynasty encouraged the inclusion of @entity153 ideals and doctrines in everyday society and imported and adapted much @entity25 culture			2
it oversaw the height of classical @entity45 science , literature and technological advances			0
cultural legacy : @entity167 wearing traditional costumes perform a ritual for the deceased @entity170 of the @entity23 at the royal shrine of @entity172 during an annual royal memorial service in @entity38 but the dynasty was weakened in the 16th and 17th centuries when both @entity26 and @entity25 invaded - leading to the country adopting an isolationist attitude to its politics			2
it thus became known as the @entity180			0
after a 200 year period of peace , its power waned however through the 18th and 19th centuries with international pressure and numerous rebellions taking their toll			2
the dynasty has left a substantial legacy to today 's @entity2 including much of @entity45 etiquette , culture and dialect			1
helping out : two @entity2 are pictured gathering water at a city well , helped out by a young @entity45 boy class system : in this picture , taken in 1904 in @entity112 , a woman of the upper class of old @entity2 , riding in a ' kama '			2

at that time , it was called @entity38 leisure time : a @entity45 fisherman takes a break from the day job and enjoys a pipe , left , while a newly married @entity45 couple pose for their first portrait but the longstanding @entity23 rule , which had also overseen the emergence of @entity224 as the national religion and great advances in science and technology , was unstable once again at the close of the 19th century , after more than two centuries of relative peace			0
@entity2 had long been a tributary nation to @entity25 and its @entity232 , but the two countries association was to end when @entity26 and @entity25 went to war primarily over @entity45 control and @entity26 was victorious			1
with the @entity25 influence over @entity2 defeated , the 26th @entity23 king , @entity238 , proclaimed the @entity239 and @entity238 became @entity240			2
the imperial government aimed to become a strong and independent nation by implementing domestic reforms ; strengthening military forces , developing commerce and industry , and surveying land ownership			0
organisations like the @entity249 also rallied to assert the rights of the @entity23 people , but clashed with the government which proclaimed absolute monarchy and power			0
celebration : the groom traditionally sat on horseback for @entity45 weddings , but this horse is part of a large procession workers : at one stage of the @entity23 , an estimated third of the population were classed as slaves no child care back then : one woman is pictured working with her baby on her back alongside an elderly couple @entity271 shades : two men in traditional dress attempt to hide from the glare of the @entity45 sun , left , while an elderly man with a stick smiles for the camera while @entity45 peddler merchants work in the background but the @entity281 was short lived - it lasted 13 years in all			0
@entity283 became increasingly influential in the country , much to the irritation of the @entity26 and the two nations went to war over the sovereignty in 1904			0
@entity2 effectively became a protectorate of @entity26 in 1905 after the @entity26 and @entity283 signed a treaty without the knowledge of @entity238 at the end of the war			1
@entity238 was forced to abdicate in 1907 and the @entity281 finally fell as the nation became an annexe of @entity26 in 1910			0
after the annexation , @entity26 set out to repress @entity45 traditions and culture , develop and implement policies primarily for the @entity26 benefit			0
getting around : two servants carry an upper class man on what looks more akin to a unicycle than a comfortable mode of transport musical interlude : a young woman stands in the background and watches a band of men as they play traditional @entity45 music lookout : @entity2 underwent a partially successful phase of modernisation when it became the @entity239 largely expanding its army happy : elderly @entity45 peddlars pictured smiling for the camera as they smoke pipes at a market stall @entity323 - style transport and communication networks were established across the nation in order to extract the resources and labour ; these networks were mostly destroyed later during the @entity329			1
the banking system was consolidated and the @entity45 currency abolished			0
the @entity26 removed the @entity23 hierarchy , destroyed much of the @entity70 palace and replaced it with the government office building			0
despite various @entity337 uprisings in the years that followed , the nation remained under @entity26 rule until the aftermath of @entity341			0
the division of @entity2 into @entity343 came following the @entity26 surrender to the @entity346 forces at the end of @entity341 in 1945			1
@entity26 had occupied @entity2 before the end of the war and it became divided into two areas of influence once the fighting stopped - @entity2 under @entity354 influence and @entity167 under @entity356 influence			1
with @entity358 tensions building , the @entity356 and @entity354 were unable to come to an agreement over a joint trusteeship over @entity2 and in 1948 the two @entity361 formally separated , with each following a separate ideology - communism in the @entity343 and capitalism in the @entity167			1
@entity167 ( @entity167 ) soldiers move in single file toward @entity2 's east - central front near @entity367 , east of the @entity368 , on june 28 , 1953 during the @entity329 but the @entity370 state came under attack from the @entity343 just two years later when the @entity372 tried to invade the @entity167 and reunite the two states under a communist ideology			1
the @entity329 saw some 1.2million people killed including more than 36,000 @entity356 soldiers , 500,000 @entity167 and 215,000 from the @entity372			2
civil war raged until july 1953 when , under the supervision of the @entity380 , the two parties signed the @entity382 agreement			0
since then a @entity383 has separated the two nations , and technically they are still at war because only an armistice was signed and not a peace treaty			0
while @entity2 has gone on to become a totalitarian state which is thought to be in the grip of poverty , @entity167 has gone from strength to strength and is now one of @entity395 's most affluent countries .			2

the pictures give a glimpse of what life was like in @entity2 at the end of the turn of the 20th century
the nation , then united , was in the midst of huge *upheaval* with a 500 - year - old dynasty about to lose power
the decades that followed set the scene for the division into @entity413 and the bloody @entity329
