watch : a message from @entity10 , @entity4 founder in march , the @entity120 company was forced to recall 17per cent of its yoga pants due to an unacceptable ' level of sheerness ' created during the manufacturing process			1
at the time , the company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they had n't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers			2

' in developing it we had to look at everything from where the yarn was coming from , how it was being knitted , the construction , the mills that we work with , ' she explains			2
shots of women practicing various yoga poses in the pants show that they do indeed seem to maintain their opacity			1
painstaking process : @entity181 , vp of global product quality , explains in the ad : ' in the testing of the product there 's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on			2
every single lot of the fabric is tested before it leaves the mill ' @entity181 , vp of global product quality , explains in the ad : ' in the testing of the product there 's probably 13 to 15 tests that go on			2
