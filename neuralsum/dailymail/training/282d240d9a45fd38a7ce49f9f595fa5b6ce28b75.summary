by @entity0 , royal correspondent published : 09:02 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 26 march 2013 last time he visited the @entity2 , prince @entity1 made a big impression for all the wrong reasons			1
but the 28 - year - old prince is preparing to tour there again in may			0
and this time , there will be no lost nights in @entity9			2
@entity1 will visit @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in a week - long trip which he hopes will highlight the work of his charities , particularly those supporting injured servicemen and women			1
close to heart : prince @entity1 's trip will focus on his many charities , particularly those involving the rehabilitation of soldiers injured in service he will also be on official business on behalf of the government , helping to promote @entity32 trade , commerce and tourism abroad			1
@entity1 is still living down his last trip to the @entity2 , back in august , when he enjoyed a ‘ lads ’ holiday ’ in @entity9 and was photographed naked playing a game of ‘ strip billiards ’ with a party of women in his £ 5,000 - a - night hotel suite			1
he has refused to apologise publicly for his antics , which caused huge embarrassment to the @entity45 , but has admitted that he let them down			0
but last year he also completed his first , hugely successful , official solo royal tour to the @entity48 and @entity49 , where he won admiration for his warmth and enthusiasm , dancing in the streets with locals and doing his best to race @entity55 , the fastest man on @entity56			0
according to sources , @entity1 , who recently returned from four months in @entity57 as an @entity59 attack helicopter pilot , will undertake this latest trip in his own ‘ indomitable style ’			2
it is sure to be a draw for royal fans as the @entity67 and @entity68 , who are expecting their first child in july , will not travel abroad this year , palace sources have confirmed			0
@entity1 's cause : the 28 - year - old @entity72 will also play in a polo tournament on behalf of @entity74 , the organisation he personally set up to help @entity77 orphans in @entity78 which he visited last month @entity1 ’s trip begins in @entity10 on may 9 with a visit to an exhibition on @entity82 to publicise the work of landmine clearance charity @entity84			1
he will also make a pilgrimage to the @entity87 and aides have not ruled out a meeting with president @entity90			0
the main focus of the trip , however , will be the 2013 @entity93 in @entity12 which will see more than 200 wounded servicemen , including a 35 - strong @entity32 team , compete in seven sports			0
@entity1 will then fly on to @entity14 to visit an area affected by last year ’s @entity98 and carry out several engagements in @entity13			1
the highlight of this part of the trip is an event to publicise the great campaign , led by the @entity105 , to promote @entity32			0
naughty prince : on his last trip to @entity2 , prince @entity1 visited @entity9 for a scandalous lads ' holiday which ended in tabloid headlines mischief managed : when in @entity9 , prince @entity1 , right , caused controversy when he was photographed naked with a group of women in his £ 5,000 a night hotel suite and no trip to @entity13 would be complete without the prince attending , and perhaps trying his hand at , a game of baseball			1
he will end his tour on may 15 by playing in the @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity15 , a huge fundraising event for his charity			0
@entity1 will travel on commercial flights to and from the @entity2 and will be accompanied by five staff , plus security			2
the cost of the trip will be met largely by his charities but in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business			0
fortunately for his security team there will be little chance for time off – and certainly no visits to @entity9 – as he needs to return to the @entity32 to resume his military duties			2
military man : the support for both @entity32 and @entity2 troops is important to @entity1 who recently returned from a four - month deployment to @entity57 as an @entity59 attack helicopter pilot			1

prince @entity1 to tour the @entity2 for the first time since @entity9 scandal
one week tour to support injured troops and promote the @entity1 's charities
trip in may includes visits to @entity13 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity14
