@entity1 's popular - and controversial - cabin crew bikini calendar has been scrapped , the airline 's chief executive has confirmed			1
the calendars , which feature 12 members of the low - cost airline 's female cabin crew posing provocatively in bikinis , have been published annually since 2008			1
as well as raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity , the calendars have raised plenty of eyebrows , with advertisements for the product banned in 2011			1
' i think it was a great idea by the cabin crew , ' he told @entity35			0
' it genuinely did raise huge amounts of money for charity and we will struggle to replace it with something as good or as successful			0
' a spokesperson for the airline said that next year 's charity efforts are still being worked out			0
' we are finalising our charity options for 2015 which will be unveiled soon , ' he said			0
charitable efforts : the calendars have been published annually since 2008 - these shots from the 2013 edition were shot in @entity52 , @entity53 objectifying staff ? despite backlash against the calendars , the airline has always defended them on the basis that the idea came from cabin crew themselves the inaugural calendar in 2008 featured cabin crew posing on aircraft and on the tarmac			1
one crew member wore a life jacket and sucked suggestively on the inflation tube , while another appeared scantily clad in the cockpit			0
in more recent years the photoshoots have taken place in @entity73 and @entity53			0
@entity1 landed in hot water with the @entity75 in 2011 , when racy shots from the photoshoot used to advertise that year 's calendar were deemed ' sexist ' and ' demeaning '			1

the ads were eventually banned by the @entity75			0
executive decision : @entity1 ceo @entity23 , who confirmed the news on @entity27 radio , has hinted that the move had been a reluctant decision last one : the 2014 was as steamy as ever , and featured the cabin crew posing in lingerie on the beach in @entity92 , @entity73 despite the backlash , the airline continued to publish the calendar , and just last year appeared to be committed to continuing the tradition			1
' there is nothing demeaning about our people volunteering to raise lots of money for very worthwhile charities such as the @entity106 @entity105 , ' spokesperson @entity97 told @entity107 at the time			2
' our charity calendars raise over â‚¬ 100,000 for charity each year so we intend and continue to support our cabin crew , who like it , and want us to continue it			2
