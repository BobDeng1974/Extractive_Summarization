@entity0 has insisted @entity1 would be a stronger , healthier club if @entity2 had won the keys to @entity4			1
the former boss of the @entity7 club was involved in two separate power bids by the @entity10 owner — the most recent the offer of a last - ditch loan two weeks ago			1
angered by the demise of the side he managed between 1986 and 1991 , @entity0 is unable to disguise his contempt for @entity17 , despite a late - night attempt by the @entity19 to sign him up for his own takeover group in 2012			1
former @entity1 manager @entity0 believes the best man lost in battle for control of @entity1 @entity0 ( @entity24 ) won a hat - trick of league titles during his spell as player - manager between 1986 - 1991 ‘ what is it ? two years since that p * * * * had it ? ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the guy who knocked on my door one night asking me if i would get involved in it with him			2
‘ it was late one night about 11 o’clock , my answer was no. ‘ i got a phonecall about an hour before that he was coming to see me			2
i had been asked to see him and i had refused			2
‘ we went for a cup of tea at a hotel around the corner			0
' you ’ve got me angry now … ’ @entity2 has failed with two power bids to take control of the former @entity50 champions a personal friend of @entity2 , @entity0 was keen to return to @entity4 with @entity52 in the event of the @entity55 - born businessman securing the assets in 2012			1
he was also on board when @entity58 - based @entity2 offered a £ 3million loan to the @entity1 board as an alternative to @entity62 , @entity63 ’s investment group			1
‘ i had a week with @entity2 in @entity64 three weeks ago , ’ @entity0 revealed			1
‘ but if it ’s not to be , it ’s not to be			0
‘ when we met we never went into detail because , the last time , we believed we had it			0
@entity2 believed he had it - only to be let down and deeply disappointed			1
we even came up to watch a @entity1 and @entity71 game because we believed we had it			1
‘ i think this time around he was always thinking the worst			0
‘ given the structure the way it is now , i would think that ’s it finished			0
‘ i do n’t know how @entity2 feels right now but i think his attitude to it has changed now the other folk are involved			1
’ @entity0 is incensed by the ongoing financial turmoil still surrounding the once great club @entity1 fans protest outside the stadium following the @entity86 quarter - final against @entity87 asked how he feels about the ongoing financial turmoil at the club , @entity0 claims anger barely covers it			1
‘ that ’s not the correct word			0
i ’m angry about it and saddened by it in equal amounts because a lot has been allowed to happen			0
‘ i do n’t want to get into being involved in a libel case			0
‘ all i would say is that if we had got it , the people there would have had the club for the right reasons			2
’ asked for his views on @entity107 owner @entity63 ’s tightening grip on the club following the appointment of henchmen @entity110 and @entity111 to the board , @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t want to end up in court			1
@entity1 players congratulate @entity115 on his winning goal in the @entity86 manager @entity117 has been forced to take care of the team under increasingly challenging circumstances ‘ i would n’t be critical of @entity63			1
he is a fantastic businessman who saw an opportunity at @entity107 and it ’s very hard to be critical , having worked there myself			1
‘ i think he has done the right thing there			0
‘ he has stuck with his manager and it looks like he is getting the rewards of that			2
that ’s what it needed			0
‘ it needs a strong owner and that ’s what he is			2
someone who has been supremely successful in anything he has touched			0
‘ i think in terms of @entity107 supporters , they should be counting their blessings rather than being critical			1
‘ now if he came to @entity1 and was to plough a shedload of money in there , everyone would be happy - but i do n’t see that happening			2
’ @entity0 would not comment on @entity107 owner @entity63 's bid to take control of the club @entity63 has appointed former @entity107 director @entity110 ( c ) on the board at @entity4 as a result of the @entity1 meltdown and the subsequent fall - out @entity0 – who enjoyed huge resources as manager - fears @entity50 football has fallen off a financial cliff and may not recover			1
‘ all i would say is that all the people who enjoyed their demise , if they had their time again , would they have voted the same way ? ‘ @entity71 getting gates of less than 20,000 ? i think it has damaged football , hopefully not beyond repair			0
‘ football goes in cycles			0
over a 10 - year period , they say if you lose a support , it ’s very hard to get that back			0
‘ i do n’t know if it will get back			0
‘ @entity1 will get back to the @entity177 , the @entity176 games will be enormous affairs again and the passion will remain the same			2
‘ but will it ever get back to where it was six or seven years ago ? i very much doubt it			0
