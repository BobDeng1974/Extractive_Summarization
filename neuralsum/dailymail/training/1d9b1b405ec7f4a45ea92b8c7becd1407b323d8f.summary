by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 11:44 est , 23 august 2012 with his fondness for a drink or two , a wicked way with the ladies and a relentlessly mischievous nature , prince @entity2 's playboy ways have earned him countless headlines over the years			2
just this week , his riotous five day trip to @entity10 culminated with nude photos splashed across the internet - and no doubt a severe drubbing from his grandmother after he returned , fully - clothed and sheepish to receive a dressing down from his press secretary at @entity20 this morning			0
now , in honour of the fun - loving prince 's safe return to the fold , thanks to spoof photographer @entity27 , @entity21 can reveal how similar scenes might have played out if @entity2 's conduct on his earlier foreign trips this year had matched that of his week in @entity32			1
up to his tricks again ? spoof clips of prince @entity2 misbehaving while on tour have been created by photographer @entity27 truth is stranger than fiction : the images @entity39 dreamed up turned out to be less outrageous than the real scenes played out in @entity10 over the past week , when @entity2 was pictured cavorting naked in his hotel suite earlier in 2012 prince @entity2 undertook an official tour on behalf of the @entity43 as part of her jubilee celebrations , which took in @entity47 and @entity48			1
by all accounts , the young royal made an excellent impression - charming dignitaries and locals alike - including large swathes of the female population who by all accounts lavished the eligible bachelor with attention			0
but what would have happened if @entity2 had succumbed to the temptation to let his hair down , @entity10 style , on those occasions ? meeting the locals : @entity27 imagines how prince @entity2 's official tours abroad could have gone if he 'd truly let his hair down as part of a new series starting tomorrow , @entity27 imagines the scenes ... with hilarious results			1
in one scene , filmed with impressive foresight way before the happenings in @entity10 , @entity2 strips off his trousers to reveal @entity75 flag boxer shorts before diving , still wearing the rest of his clothes , into a swimming pool			0
in another , he parties poolside with a gaggle of bikini - clad girls ( sounding familiar ? ) before they corner him in a hammock and pour cocktails into his open mouth while he blows smoke rings after smoking what looks like a marijuana cigarette			1
doubletake : @entity39 is famous for creating portraits of celebrities caught off guard in awkward situations using lookalikes in a clip of what @entity39 imagines could have been the sort of shenanigans that went on during his @entity47 tour , @entity2 eyes are on stalks as a carnival dancer shakes her nipple tassels at him as she advances on the flustered prince			0
for @entity27 , who usually imagines the most outrageous and unlikely scenes in which to portray her fake subjects , the irony can not be lost that for once , the scenes she has come up with have been trumped soundly by the antics of the real @entity2 himself just one day before the clips were due for release			2
let 's just hope the @entity43 realises they are fake before she takes her grandson to task again			0
holiday romance : @entity39 imagines the young prince being beguiled by the charms of the locals ( something that turned out to be not a million miles from the truth ) at ease ! ' @entity2 ' relaxes in a hammock in his military uniform to see more behind - the - scenes footage of @entity2 and a host of other stars : celebrity @entity129 is broadcast on bbc3 10pm on friday 24 august .			2
