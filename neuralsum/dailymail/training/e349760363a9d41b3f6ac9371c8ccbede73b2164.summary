missing toddler @entity2 may have been buried under rubble at a building site following a tragic accident , @entity1 police believe			1
the search for the @entity9 boy , whose disappearance 21 years ago became one of the highest profile missing child cases in recent memory , is to be relaunched as officers seek to dig up a mound near where he was last seen			1
authorities on the island of @entity21 are working alongside @entity23 police and have asked them for 3d ground scanning equipment to check for bones beneath the surface			0
but @entity29 's mother @entity28 , who insists her son is still alive , does not believe he will be found there			1
clinging to hope : @entity29 's mother @entity33 , 40 , believes police will not find her son under the rubble and insists he is still alive the 40 - year - old , from @entity37 , @entity9 , was shocked to hear detectives are planning to excavate the site next to a farmhouse which her father @entity41 was renovating at the time			1
@entity1 police decided to officially reopen the decades - old cold case after a @entity46 driver claimed he had been digging just 50 yards away from where the boy was last seen			0
@entity29 disappeared on the afternoon of july 24 , 1991 , after his young mother left him with her parents while she went to work at a hotel			1
@entity41 and @entity53 took him to a farmhouse belonging to their friend @entity55 , where the couple ate lunch as their grandson played outside			0
but when they realised @entity29 had fallen silent , they discovered he was nowhere to be seen and called for a police search team			2
still seeking answers : a young @entity28 on the island of @entity21 , where her son @entity29 went missing while in the care of her parents nightmare : @entity41 ( left ) and @entity53 ( right ) were looking after @entity29 while young mother @entity33 ( centre ) was at work according to the @entity74 , three main theories have emerged : firstly , that @entity29 wandered away and was caught under rubble as it was unloaded from a truck ; that he was killed in an accident and buried in a shallow grave where the building waste would later be dumped ; and lastly , that he was murdered and his body was hidden on the site			1
however , ms @entity28 recalls the rubble was already there when she visited the area with @entity29 and his father , her then boyfriend @entity86			1
she said : ' my dad was renovating the farmhouse			0
there was some building work going on but it was further down the lane from the farmhouse where @entity29 was			1
mystery : @entity29 , who was just 21 months old when he vanished in july 1991 ' the area where they are referring to is to the left of the property			2
that mound of rubble and waste was already there while @entity29 was still there			1
' so i find it very unlikely to believe that @entity29 is there unless he buried himself			1
but we have got to try and turn it into a positive way of thinking and if the @entity1 want to satisfy that @entity29 is not up there then fine			2
ms @entity28 , who was just 19 when her son vanished , spoke of her shock upon waking up to the news that investigators were pursuing the new lead			0
' it 's an awful thought for me and my family to have to deal with , ' she said			0
' but it is now showing after 20 - plus years the @entity1 police are actually interested in doing something with the case			0
i believe that has been prompted by @entity125 involvement and their genuine support for me and my family			0
' and if this is what the @entity1 police want to do then that 's fine - and if the @entity23 police can assist them then that would be excellent			0
' @entity29 's file was re-opened after @entity46 driver @entity133 came forward to reveal he had been digging on the site when the boy went missing			1
he told the mirror : ' yes , i was the man with the @entity46 that day			0
loads of earth was being taken to clear the ground for the new house down the road			0
' the 61 - year - old said he does not believe @entity29 was abducted			1
last year @entity125 sent detective chief inspector @entity143 to @entity21 , where he and a colleague were told of the theory that the child 's remains would be found on the building site			1
a @entity1 source told the mirror : ' this idea is a lot more plausible than @entity29 being abducted			2
a stranger would have needed to be watching the house and then would have snatched him in broad daylight before secreting him off the island by boat or plane			0
' never found : @entity29 , who slipped out of his grandparents ' sight at a farmhouse owned by their friend , would be 23 this year the source added that detectives on the island knew a dumper truck had been driving on the track near the house in the days and weeks following the disappearance			2
even still , the boy 's mother thinks he was taken and that a white car seen in the area that day could be a vital clue			0
ms @entity28 is holding on to the hope that no remains will be unearthed from beneath the rubble			0
she said : ' once it is proved that @entity29 is not dead , which is what i know and i believe , then maybe the @entity1 police will continue with their efforts to try and find @entity29			1
they can put their minds at rest and then widen the search			0
' i have now got to gather my strength and keep fighting			0
the one thing i do n't want to happen is for the @entity23 public to think " ok then @entity29 's dead and we no longer have to search for him "			2
' i believe @entity29 is not dead - he is still alive and he is well and he is living out there			1
' appeal for sightings : these computer - generated images , released in the last decade as hopes of ever finding @entity29 faded , showed how he might have looked at the age of 10 ( left ) and 18 ( right )			2
