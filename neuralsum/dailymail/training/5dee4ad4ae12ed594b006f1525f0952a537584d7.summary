@entity0 has one word for his achievements after three months in charge at @entity4 – great			1
the @entity5 , who asked to be judged in mid-october when he took over at @entity6 in july , was asked to assess his performance on friday and the response was typically blunt			1
‘ i am always great , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ that ’s a very easy question			0
but much more important is that the players have confidence in the manager and his staff			2
‘ when i respond i ’m arrogant because normally i am always moving in the right direction – i have showed that already			0
’ despite winning the last two games , @entity4 were holding on against @entity23 and @entity50 and @entity9 believes the players have still to fully embrace his philosophy			1
he added : ‘ i think they do understand the philosophy but they have to perform that philosophy			0
we have to see if it is going to a higher level			0
we need more balance in the team			2
‘ i said that after the match against @entity23 , and i am looking for balance in the team not only spectacular attacking football , but also when you lose the ball that you have a shape as a team and that you can defend more easily , and kill the game better			2
‘ that ’s also part of the philosophy and also because i am always choosing creative attacking football players			2
so we are looking for the balance and we shall see if the time i have had was long enough			0
’ @entity9 confirmed that there no fresh injuries from the international break but is not sure if any of his current casualties – @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 – would be fit to face @entity12 on monday			1
@entity4 were put through their paces on friday as they prepared for the clash at @entity97 and looked to be in decent shape			1
@entity15 , who has been out since august because of groin and pelvis problems looked sharp in the session , as did @entity16 who came on against @entity23 in the @entity103 ' last match after being sidelined through injury			1
manager @entity0 watches on during training while @entity28 goes through his stretches to keep fit during his ban @entity108 ( left ) and @entity109 ( centre ) were in international action for @entity112 and @entity31 respectively last week @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 midfielder @entity37 ( right ) are both set to start against the @entity12 on monday in the absence of @entity28 @entity37 put in a good performance in the match against @entity23 and will take up the no 10 position again against @entity12 @entity9 is hoping his side can continue their winning run against @entity12 but admits the @entity12 will be tough opposition and said : ' we start monday against @entity12 with a victory i hope			1
' you can lose in this sport also , only @entity127 have n’t lost			0
' normally every club can lose			0
but i think @entity12 are very difficult to beat especially at home			0
' they are a dangerous opponent that is difficult to beat			0
but there is no club in the premier league that is easy to beat , and that ’s the difference with other leagues			0
' we have to start with a victory after the international break because we have won the last three games			2
' @entity143 and @entity144 , striking similar poses , both played for @entity31 in midweek but came through the match without any ill - effects @entity109 , @entity29 and assistant coach @entity147 discuss tactics as they walk to the @entity149 @entity151 @entity150 ( left , centre ) looked relaxed in the training session and @entity93 was able to jog as he recovers from injury @entity28 , @entity15 and @entity156 walk to training as the team prepared for monday 's trip to the @entity160 to take on @entity12 @entity90 ( left ) lifts a weight as he continues his rehabilitation from injury , while @entity164 playmaker @entity38 grimaces @entity165 not out of the question - @entity167			1
