by @entity1 reporter @entity2 may have mastered futuristic technology as @entity4 but he 's less than happy about @entity6 's new app for celebrities , called mentions			1
the app , released last week , would force @entity2 to follow other celebrity accounts			0
' the first person on the list i was given was @entity14 ( rolling my eyes			2
) , ' the @entity17 actor wrote on his @entity18 , in a recent blog , actor @entity2 called @entity6 's new app for celebrities , called mentions , ' ill conceived ' @entity2 recently criticized @entity22 for allowing ' nobodies ' to get verified accounts the former co-starts have famously feuded over the years , and as @entity26 noted @entity14 called @entity2 ' very self - centered ' only a week ago on ' @entity27			1

if this app is for celebrities then why force them to follow another celebrity in order to set up this app ? i think that is a flaw ; i â€™m already following those who i want to follow - why insist i follow that short list of others ? ' @entity2 would prefer it if mentions allowed him to access his page 's photos , settings , and events , and that more features from the @entity53 app were available for @entity46			2
@entity2 declined to follow former co-star @entity14 , who has called the @entity4 actor ' very self - centered ' he summed up the experience as ' ill conceived			1
