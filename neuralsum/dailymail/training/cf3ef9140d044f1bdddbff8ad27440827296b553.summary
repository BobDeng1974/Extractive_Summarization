by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 19 september 2013 as well as the training scheme , health secretary @entity1 will today announce plans to turn around the country 's most failed hospitals the brightest doctors could be sent to @entity7 and trained - up to take over failing hospitals under proposals to be unveiled by the health secretary			1
@entity1 wants 50 of the best doctors - as well as some senior nurses and businessmen - to be sent on a fast - track course to turn them into top @entity17 managers			2
mr @entity1 is concerned that there is presently a glut of ‘ mediocre ’ managers in the health service with many of them being paid six - figure sums to run failing organisations			1
earlier this year it emerged that the hospital boss who presided over the worst scandal in the history of the @entity17 had been given the £ 100,000 a year job despite having no previous managerial experience			2
@entity32 - who presided over @entity33 when hundreds of patients died from neglect - was appointed in 2005 because there were no other suitable candidates			1
other health experts have warned that this lack of talent means hospitals have no choice but to appoint poor managers into highly paid roles			1
this has led to a ‘ revolving door ’ scenario with bosses moving between hospitals every two or three years earning ever higher salaries despite failing to improve care			2
mr @entity1 - along with other health professionals - believes that doctors and nurses are far better placed to run hospitals than managers with no medical experience			1
under the proposals to be announced today , a total of £ 10 million will be invested into the ten - month scheme that will start next @entity61			2
it is likely to involve eight weeks of leadership training at the prestigious @entity7 , in @entity64 , @entity65 , although this is still under negotiation			2
@entity33 oversaw a failure in care which lead to the deaths of many patients it will also include four weeks of classroom training in the @entity74 , six months at a top @entity17 hospital and a one - month placement in a major company such as @entity78 or @entity79			1
the recruits will not get any formal qualification although they will be guaranteed a senior position on the board of a hospital - most likely one that is currently failing			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ if we want this country to be a world - leader , we need a world - leading health service led by the very brightest and best , so i am ambitious about seeking out fresh talent wherever we can find it			2
‘ mediocre management and lack of clinical leadership were key contributors to the tragedy at @entity33			1
' we are determined to learn that lesson , and train strong leaders drive up standards across the @entity17 through this cutting - edge programme			0
’ the doctors and other staff will have to serve at least two years as top @entity17 managers before leaving to work in the private sector - where pay is far higher			0
professor @entity106 , president of the @entity107 said : ‘ there ’s currently a real lack of managers who have done any clinical training			1
‘ they are very process - driven and it ’s all about bed - waits , winter pressures and not whether the health of people has actually improved			0
‘ what the government is proposing is n’t new it ’s just an extension of what ’s already happening			0
doctors already occupy senior management roles			0
' as well as the 50 @entity17 doctors , other notable graduates of @entity7 include current @entity65 president @entity128 , modernist author @entity129 and @entity131 actor @entity130 but @entity132 said it was a mistake spending millions sending doctors to the @entity65 when so many hospitals were so short - staffed			0
@entity136 mp , @entity132 ’s shadow health minister said : ‘ patients will struggle to understand this decision			0
‘ when half of all hospital wards in @entity142 will be short - staffed tonight , ministers surely ca n’t think it ’s a priority to send @entity17 managers to train in the @entity65			0
‘ this is the wrong priority and further proof you ca n’t trust the @entity147 with the @entity17			0
’ later today the health secretary will explain how he plans to turn - around 11 failing @entity17 trusts with the worst death rates in the country			1
@entity153 performing @entity17 managers are to be drafted in to turn around failing hospitals in a move that @entity1 said would lead to ' real change '			1
the 11 hospitals put in special measures in the wake of the scandal over standards at @entity33 and subsequent @entity162 will be partnered with the best @entity17 trusts and managers in a scheme that echoes the ' super-heads ' programme to turn around failing schools			1
one example is @entity170 in @entity171 , which has been placed in special measures and is in ' desperate need ' of it improvements			0
that hospital has been partnered with @entity176 , which mr @entity1 said has one of the best it systems in the country			2
he told @entity180 's today programme : ' we are very aware that there are risks , but what 's the alternative ? ' i think in a situation like this we have a handful of really inspirational leaders and these people are anxious to help us turn around these failing hospitals , they want to play their part '			1
trusts including @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 and @entity199 have all been taken over by hit squads after an inspections earlier this summer unearthed poor care			0
but six are ‘ foundation trusts ’ - a coveted status brought in under @entity132 which was meant to reward the best - performing hospitals .			0
