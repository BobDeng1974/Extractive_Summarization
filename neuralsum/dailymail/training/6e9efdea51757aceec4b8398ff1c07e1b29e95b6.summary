by @entity1 reporter published : 22:10 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 9 september 2013 more than a thousand former members and officials of @entity4 gathered this weekend to create a @entity6 - based alternative to the @entity4			1
its goal is to counter what the new groups says is the ' moral free - fall ' of the nation , and ' raise a generation of faithful husbands , fathers , citizens and leaders , ' organizers told the national inaugural convention in @entity20 , @entity21			0
the move comes in response to the @entity4 ’s recent repeal of a restriction that denied membership to youth based on sexual orientation , which will take effect at the start of next year			1
new group : over 1,200 disgruntled former @entity4 officials descended on @entity20 , @entity21 this weekend , in order to launch a new , ' @entity6 - based ' alternative to the @entity4 , as it voted earlier this year to lift its ban on gay members @entity6 centered : @entity38 is the culmination of months of planning and prayer following the scouts ¿ decision this summer to permit openly homosexual members , turning its back on more than 100 years of being biblically straight 1,200 people from across the @entity46 met for a two - day conference to select the name , logo and uniforms of the new organization , now called @entity38			1
the group has captured widespread attention because of its other mission — to provide a robust alternative to the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
cofounder @entity56 says the organization will have a ' prominent faith component ' and become a ' masculine outdoor program to raise young men			1
' ' most of us are coming from a highly - structured environment that has 103 years of culture and language and program and symbols … and we are starting from scratch , ' he told @entity69			0
decisions : this weekend members decided on a name and a logo for the new activity group at the opening session , @entity75 , chairman of the board of @entity38 , teased the crowd saying he would not be surprised if there were ' spies ' from @entity80 , @entity81 — @entity4 ’s home base — in the audience			1
@entity38 ’s name , drawn from more than 300 options , was carefully vetted and is intended not to be political or controversial , organizers said			2
' @entity87 ' refers to a pathway and being outdoors , but also symbolizes the passage of life , where there are moral choices , and right and wrong paths , said mr. @entity75			0
' our whole life is about the trail , both in the outdoors and in the journey of life as believers , ' he said			0
' so @entity38 is a way of life that is centered on following @entity102 in the outdoors			2
' founder : @entity105 began @entity38 in response to the @entity4 's decision to allow gay youths to remain in the scout movement organizers also unveiled the new @entity38 logo : it features a circle with a sun , mountaintops with a path , and a male figure with a hand extended over his head , beckoning others to follow			1
mr @entity75 , who founded @entity120 in response to @entity4 ’s vote in may that reversed the organization 's long - standing ban on openly gay youth among its ranks , says the organization will become ' a program that we believe will be stronger , safer and more principled in every way			1
' he told @entity69 in july that , while the new organization would allow gay members , it would not permit them to ' flaunt ' their sexual orientation			0
' there is not going to be any kind of a witch hunt in our organization for people and what their sexual orientations are , ' he clarified			0
we ’re going to focus on sexual purity not sexual orientation			0
' @entity146 , an @entity147 activist , @entity148 , and founder of @entity150 , was saddened by the departure of so many families from the @entity4			2
he also questioned @entity38 ’s intentions of allowing gay members			2
changes : @entity4 announced earlier this year that it is lifting the ban on gay members and thus allowing anyone regardless of their sexual orientation to enjoy the benefits of the youth programme angry : the decision , which still denies adults from serving as @entity148 leaders , has upset conservative groups who believe that gays should not be allowed in the @entity4 at all ' you still can not discuss sexuality within the @entity4 , ' mr @entity146 told @entity69			1
' that has n't changed and that will not change , and so , it 's really a distinction without a difference that they 're trying to make here			0
' ' scouting is for all young men , ' mr @entity146 said			2
@entity38 will be inclusive of boys , regardless of religion , race , national origin or socioeconomic status , and accept boys who are experiencing same - sex attractions or gender confusion			0
however , it will not admit youth who are open or avowed about their homosexuality , and it will also not admit boys who are not ' biologically male ' or boys who wish to dress and act like girls			0
the new organization is modeled after the @entity192 , an 18 - year - old organization that is ' @entity102 - centered ' and is ' seen as an alternative to @entity194 , ' according to the group 's website			0
adult leaders of @entity38 will be @entity6 who sign a statement of faith and submit to background checks			1
both boys and adults will be required to adhere to a code of conduct			0
the goal is to ' become the premier organization that honors @entity209 and builds some great young men , ' @entity205 , one of the board members told the @entity212 .			1

1,200 gathered this weekend to choose the name and logo of the new organization
formed in response to gays being allowed in the @entity4
new @entity38 group aimed at young @entity6 men
gays will be allows in new group so long as sexuality is not ' flaunted '
