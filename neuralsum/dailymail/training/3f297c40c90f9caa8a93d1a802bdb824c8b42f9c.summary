by @entity0 taunted and tormented , a female orangutan is cruelly mocked by villagers who have captured her and turned her into an afternoon ’s entertainment			1
alone with no water or food , she is surrounded by a circle of jeering humans			1
when she tries to break free , to run back to the jungle in western @entity12 where she lives with other members of her endangered species , a cable around her waist holds her back			2
this orangutan was mocked by villagers who captured her and turned her into an afternoon 's entertainment alone and with no water or food , she was surrounded by a circle of jeering humans she was rescued by a @entity27 animal charity she has been rescued and will soon be released into a safe area the good news for this particular orangutan is that thanks to a @entity27 animal charity she has been rescued and will soon be released into a safe area			1
but her plight shows why environmentalists fear they have years of work ahead of them in educating remote villages about the need to protect , not capture or kill , these animals whose numbers are falling dramatically			2
about 100 years ago it was thought there were 315,000 orangutans in the wild but today there are less than 54,000 in @entity12 and only around 6,000 on the @entity47 island of @entity48			0
the population has declined because of the spread of palm oil plantations , the products of which include soaps and perfumes that are sold in @entity57 high street stores			0
the spread of humans , who chop down trees to make room for their villages , has also reduced their numbers			1

she was dragged back to the village and the degradation began			0
she could only sit as families left their huts and others rode in from other areas on their motorcycles to stare or laugh at the sad captive			0
the scene bordered on torture of a helpless animal			0
at one point , a pole was erected so she could clamber up – to the added amusement of the crowd			0
but one of the villagers thought it had all gone too far and decided the torment should stop			0
