@entity1 seamer @entity0 is not taking the threat of @entity3 lightly as his side look to keep building momentum for the @entity6 knockout phase			1
the tournament co-hosts have won their opening five matches and are guaranteed to finish top of @entity13 , regardless of their result against the @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity17			2
yet the @entity1 will want to end the pool with a flourish and enter their quarter - final in the best possible frame of mind			1
@entity0 , who has taken 13 wickets already this @entity6 , appeals successfully for an lbw decision on home soil , they have won all six of their previous one - day international meetings against @entity3 but it is the @entity31 side that triumphed 3 - 0 when the teams last met on the subcontinent in late 2013			1
@entity0 told @entity35 's official website : ' success is there for us when we are playing them in their own backyard but when we have travelled there we have struggled a little bit			0
' they are full of some world class players and we know that they will be a tough candidate come friday night			0
' @entity1 have won all five games so far , including beating co-hosts @entity48 , to secure top spot in @entity50 @entity0 has played a starring role in @entity1 's stellar start to the tournament with 13 wickets in five matches , including a spectacular five - for against @entity48			1
it is quite an achievement for the 25 - year - old , who had made just 16 odi appearances before the tournament got under way			2
' the success that we have been having has been pretty special and [ this @entity6 ] is something that i will look back on and be really proud of , ' he added			0
' i am sure that i speak for the majority of the group there as well			0
a @entity6 in my home country , it 's not hard to get motivated for that			0
' @entity0 and the @entity1 attack have been unstoppable , but he says they wo n't take @entity3 lightly another pillar of @entity1 's success has been the largely excellent starts they have made to their batting , thanks to opener @entity79 's masterclass in power hitting			1
the @entity1 captain has made 249 runs at an average of just under 50 in his five matches and his staggering strike rate of 193.02 has laid the foundations for his side			2
@entity3 spin bowling coach @entity89 has admitted they have options to try and stifle @entity79			2
@entity3 are already into the quarter finals after beating @entity93 on monday to get out of the @entity13 stage ' he has not had to start against spinners , ' @entity89 told @entity96			1
' it will be tough for us but we have plans for him as well			0
i 'm pretty sure it will help the spinners			0
' the @entity15 proved they were not among the also rans of the tournament by beating @entity93 to book their place in the quarter - finals and could finish as high as second in the pool if they win on friday and @entity110 record a shock win against @entity48			1
the @entity15 could still finish as high as second in the group if they pull off an unlikely victory over @entity1			0

@entity1 have won all five of their matches so far in home tournament
but @entity1 lost 3 - 0 when they played @entity3 away in 2013
@entity3 are into quarter finals after beating @entity93 this week
