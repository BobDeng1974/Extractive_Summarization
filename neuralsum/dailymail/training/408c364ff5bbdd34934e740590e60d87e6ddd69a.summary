@entity0 reveals the real story behind his clash with cranky @entity3 when @entity3 took aim at female journalists in @entity6 and sparked a union revolt against his tour			1
he eats a tin of black cherries every day ' to ward off arthritis ' and uses a vibrating piece of gym equipment to keep fit , ' one of his secrets of eternal youth '			1
the former @entity17 , 85 , remains a raconteur of the highest order but as for his cooking , kitchen cabinet host @entity20 says , he rates a six out of 10			1
' i would call him a very credible middle order batsmen in the prime minister ’s @entity24 in the kitchen , ' she said			1
the former @entity17 is described by host @entity20 as being ' enthusiastic ' as ever , telling several funny anecdotes during hours of filming at his luxury @entity33 home ' i asked @entity28 ( @entity0 's wife ) to rate him one to 10 in the kitchen and she said maybe a one			1
she was definitely playing it down , i give him at least a six , he is not a customary figure in the kitchen , once he turned his mind to it , he pulled it off brilliantly i think , any chef that can conclude a meal by offering you a session of putt putt on the roof of his house gets extra points			0
' age has not wearied him , the former @entity60 leader as cheeky as ever			0
' there ’s a couple of moments ( during the shoot ) he ’s just kind of enthusiastic , ' @entity20 revealed			1
' we were doing a tour of the house and we come across this piece of gym equipment , which essentially is a giant vibrator			0
' i noticed it in the games room and the next second he ’s on it and he says ‘ jump on ’ and the next thing i ’m riding this enormous vibrator in @entity0 ’s house , a very weird place to be			1
' this is kind of one of his secrets of eternal youth , he jumps on this thing and gets violently jiggled up and down			1
it ’s a legitimate piece of gym equipment , ’ she laughed			0
' i had no idea that being shaken violently is something that keeps you healthy but apparently it ’s good for your circulation			0
@entity0 and @entity92 married in 1995 ' he ’s just an enthusiast , the way that he and @entity28 interact , they ’re kind of like a couple of teenagers , the whole experience is hilarious and sort of touching and a little sort of " golly , i hope i ’m like that when i ’m 85 "			1
' he was also endlessly willing to talk and his recall is unbelievably good , he ’s 85 years old yet he ’s still as gregarious and still takes as much enjoyment in telling a yarn and his recall of dates and details is still quite spectacular			2
' @entity29 , as @entity20 describes the show , ' invades the home , four cameras , lighting and al ' that stuff ' where the crew can spend up to eight hours filming and interviewing a politician - usually a current mp but she was happy that @entity0 was ' a great privilege '			1
@entity0 the politician on the hustings in 1983			1
he would win that year 's election and serve as pm until 1991 he tells the show host that being genuine ultimately wins voters over			2
' i wanted to talk to him about his views on politics today , ' @entity20 said			1
' the thing about @entity126 is that he is the prime minister that got away with everything , he kind of broke the rule book on things you are n’t and are allowed to do as a political leader			1
the womanising , the drinking , the weeping , the doldrums that he fell into when he was having a difficult time in his family life			0
' his view and it is still very robust today , is that the secret to political success is to love people			2
' to have this sort of relationship with the @entity6 people that means that people are persuaded of your bona fides they ’ll overlook or forgive you for any boo - boos you make along the way			0
' @entity126 was @entity6 's third - longest serving @entity17 , from 1983 to 1991 before being toppled by treasurer @entity152 in a party room challenge			1
' i asked him about his advice to @entity157 , it ’s interesting advice , to not let go of your heritage and to listen to the people and to be genuine in everything that you do , ' she added			0
he did bristle at one line of questioning			0
' you have , and i say this to @entity126 during the interview , to be a political leader you do have to be a tiny bit crazy in the brain , you know ? ' @entity20 said			1
' they ’re not normal people			0
i do n’t say that to be insulting , i think he kind of thought i was being insulting			0
you have to have a different kind of mental make - up , somebody normal would n’t last two days in that sort of job			0
@entity0 pictured during a media conference at the @entity6 embassy in @entity184 host @entity20 was particularly taken by his recollections of meeting @entity187 president @entity186 @entity0 pictured with his first wife @entity188			1
they married in 1956 and had four children ' you have to have this incredible combination of attributes , you have to decisive enough and convinced enough of your plans and your vision to be able to get up out of bed every morning and face the world even when people are saying you ’re an idiot and you ’re running the place into rack and ruin			0
' she believes that @entity204 ’s death rather than diminish from the episode will , in fact , shine an even more important light on her time with @entity0 , as it provides an insight into what makes our former political leaders tick and how politics has changed			1
' @entity204 ’s political life was extraordinary – the thing that i think is inspirational is that he was a hungry searcher for wisdom all of his life , ' @entity20 said			2
' he drew from the classics , from the arts , from science and infused his sense of public duty and leadership with all that he absorbed from the world around him			0
' i think being a leader that finds inspiration from history and in reading is quite an important thing			0
if there is one thing that troubles me about modern politics is that its practitioners barely have the time to scratch themselves let alone to find ideas in the world around them			0
' @entity241 had a very different approach – he derived energy from the people around him , he ’s a great lover of the @entity6 people			0
' he found his inspiration and energy from being among people , whether the shopping centres or sporting events or getting out on the punt			0
he was hungry for human contact			0
' @entity0 ( right ) paid tribute to his @entity255 predecessor @entity204 ( centre ) today after his death , saying ' @entity6 was a better country because of the life and work of @entity204 '			2
the @entity60 leaders are pictured with @entity261 ( left ) who succeeded @entity204 as @entity17 in 1975 @entity0 today paid tribute to @entity204 ' that this is not a time of sadness , he was ready to go and his family was ready for him to go '			2
mr @entity0 also added that @entity6 is a better country because of the life and work of @entity204 and that he made the @entity60 relevant and led the party with great imagination			2
' he steams me a fish , which was really kind of delicious and made a sauce to go with it			2
having decided to cook lunch he threw himself whole - heartedly into it , ' kitchen cabinet host @entity20 said of @entity0 @entity20 continued , recalling that @entity0 ' lives to tell stories '			1
' we could really have made it a 90 minute episode just with back to back yarns – there is quite a long story about his personal clash with @entity3 which was so fabulous , which we will put up on - line because people shoud n’t miss it , ' she added			2
' half an hour is not that long when we ’ve got a fish to steam and he ’s got this hilarious story about his first ever interaction with @entity186 when he was first prime minister			1
' the insight he can give to conducting foreign affairs as a new prime minister into the art of being a successful prime minister for such a long period is just invaluable			1
' and she finds that the relationship with @entity152 still simmers			2
' there ’s such an unbelievable kind of slow motion tango going on between these two men ( @entity126 and @entity152 ) , ' she said			2
' so extraordinary , one of the most fascinating things of looking at politics is that these giants enmesh and disentangle from each other and then they ca n’t quite ever let go of each other			0
' every year or two there ’s a public conflagration between them , they share their mixed recollections of whose idea it was to float the dollar , whose idea it was to reform the economy who was more committed to making these changes and who did more to bring them about			0
' will we ever get to the end of the @entity126 wars ? i suspect not			0
' @entity29 airs tonight ( tuesday ) at 8pm on @entity325			1
