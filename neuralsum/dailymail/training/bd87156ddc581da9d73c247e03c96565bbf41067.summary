by @entity0 for @entity1 one 92 - year - old man proves it 's never too late to tell someone you love them			1
last year , @entity7 of @entity8 married @entity9 , the woman he spent a summer working with in 1950 and instantly fell in love with			1
the two never got together during that summer because @entity11 had a boyfriend , but @entity13 continued to think about what could have been			1
they reconnected 62 years later when @entity7 sent @entity11 a love letter out of the blue			1
now the husband and wife live together in @entity11 ' home on @entity21 , making up for lost time			2
young love : 92 - year - old @entity7 ( left ) and 82 - year - old @entity9 ( right ) met in 1950 but never ended up dating			1
the two reconnected more than 60 years later when @entity7 sent a coded love letter to his former crush			1
pictured above at their wedding last year correspondence : @entity7 and @entity11 worked one summer in 1950 and would write notes to each other in the office in code , on sheets of paper towels			1
@entity7 sent @entity11 a letter in february 2012 in the same code , saying ' i have never stopped loving you ' age gap : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) pictured around the time they met in 1950			1
@entity11 was 18 and @entity7 was 28 however , @entity11 was hesitant when she first received the love letter in february 2012			1
popping the question : the couple met again in person in may 2012 and within an hour @entity7 had asked @entity11 to marry him			1
she agreed and they were married a year later ( one of their two ceremonies pictures above ) it was written in code and on paper towels , but she soon remembered the way she used to pass notes with @entity7 that summer , when she worked at a geology lab sorting plankton			1
at the end of that first note , @entity7 wrote that he had ' never stopped loving ' @entity11 , according to the @entity62			2
unsure of what to think of the gesture after more than six decades apart , she showed the letter to her writing group who mostly agreed that it was romantic			0
so @entity11 started writing @entity69 as the two caught up on their lifetime apart			2
both had married and had children , but ended up single			0
@entity11 divorced her husband and father of her five children several decades ago			2
@entity7 divorced his first wife and his second wife died			2
he worked as a microbiologist as well as a dentist and photographer			0
before becoming a mystery novelist , @entity11 worked as a science journalist , boat captain and was the seventh woman to set foot on the @entity87			2
they also talked about their first summer together , with @entity7 revealing that he fell for @entity11 from the first moment he saw her			1
she admits that she always thought of him as an older brother , since she was 18 at the time and he was 28			0
by may 2012 , they both organized a trip to meet in person , with @entity11 flying out to @entity98			0
but before the trip , @entity11 expressed worry about whether he would be disappointed with her older body			0
' of course i remember the @entity104 , but is it the @entity106 [ her nickname ] that is with me			0
you are the one , ' @entity108 said			0
' now is the person i love and not the shadow of the past			0
but she sure set the stage and what a beautiful introduction			0
' happy ending : the couple now live together at @entity117 's home on @entity21 in @entity118 dedicated : the couple admit that their time together is limited , so they keep their romance alive with little gestures @entity7 met @entity11 at the train station , holding a single red rose and within an hour , asked @entity11 for her hand in marriage and she agreed			1
the next year , @entity7 had moved out to @entity21 and the two were married in both a @entity130 and church ceremony			1
this summer they took a paddle - wheeler down the @entity134 as a honeymoon			0
since they are both getting on in years , they make sure to keep their relationship alive with little gestures , like @entity69 writing ' @entity141 ' on his wife 's banana peel for breakfast			0
' we realize we have limited time , ' @entity11 told the @entity62			2
' it ’s unrealistic to think too far ahead			0
and so all the things that would have bothered me as a young woman do n’t bother me anymore			0

@entity9 , 82 , and @entity7 , 92 , met while working for a geology lab in the summer of 1950
@entity7 says he immediately fell in love with @entity11 , but the two never dated because she had a boyfriend at the time
more than 60 years later , the two reconnected when @entity7 sent a coded love letter
they were married last year after @entity7 moved *cross-country* to be with his long - lost love
