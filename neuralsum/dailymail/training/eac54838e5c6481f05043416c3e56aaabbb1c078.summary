by @entity0 , @entity1 the canyon - like scars which line @entity5 ' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water			1
but a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid – one much less hospitable to life – may actually have carved these features			1
on @entity5 , the most striking topography occurs around the equator			1
the planet ’s low latitudes are dominated by the @entity19 plateau , which hosts several towering volcanoes			0
the canyon - like scars which line @entity5 ' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water.but a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid – one much less hospitable to life – may actually have carved these features			1
in this image , a geothermal picture of the @entity5 surface shows the massive gorge system not far off sits the solar system ’s largest – @entity35			1
near the @entity38 fringe , however , things start to get deep			0
there the land dives into a winding maze of valleys and river - like ' outflow channels ' , the former including the 2,485 miles ( 4000km ) - long @entity45 – the ' @entity46 ' of @entity5 – which exceeds its terrestrial namesake in every dimension			1
these great gouges are widely thought to have been formed , at least in part , by flowing water			1
but according to recently published research , they could have had a very different genesis , linked to the volcanoes to the west			2
a paper by @entity58 of the @entity59 , published in the @entity60 , suggests that the @entity5 valleys and outflow channels were in fact formed mostly by lava flows , which erupted from the @entity19 plateau in the planet ’s distant past			1
the 2,485 mile ( 4000km ) - long @entity45 ( pictured ) – the ' @entity46 ' of @entity5 – exceeds its namesake in every dimension			1
these gouges are widely thought to have been formed by flowing water			1
but according to recently published research , they could have had a very different genesis , linked to the volcanoes to the west the slopes of a huge @entity5 volcano , once covered in ice , may have been home to one of the most recent habitable environments to be found on the red planet			1
geological landforms discovered on @entity84 , the @entity5 ’ third tallest volcano , suggest that lakes could have existed on the planet 210 million years ago			2
researchers believe the lakes may have been home to bacteria and other single - celled organisms which evolved at the same time as dinosaurs began appearing on @entity93			0
nearly twice as tall as @entity94 , @entity84 would have produced intense heat from eruptions that melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes			0
these are bodies of water that form within glaciers like bubbles in a half - frozen ice cube			2
the ice - covered lakes of @entity84 would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater , according to calculations by @entity110 , a graduate student at @entity111 in @entity112			0
and where there ’s water , there ’s the possibility of a habitable environment			2
‘ this is interesting because it ’s a way to get a lot of liquid water very recently on @entity5 , ’ ms @entity110 said			1
to draw this conclusion , professor @entity58 scrutinised thousands of images from @entity126 's @entity125 ( @entity125 ) spacecraft , which has been orbiting the planet since 2006			0
this allowed him to map the floors of the equatorial valleys and outflow channels at an extremely high resolution of up to 25cm per pixel			0
these images appear to show extensive lava flows draping the floors of many of the valleys and channels			0
around 90 per cent of the floors look to be covered either by lava or by lava - related landslides			0
the morphology of the lava flows professor @entity58 encountered suggest that the lava actually incised the valleys and channels in the first place			0
the @entity125 images seem to show that channels formed by the freshly erupted lava were later deepened and widened by the passage of liquid rock			1
this type of erosion , professor @entity58 argues , can explain the existence of the valleys and outflow channels without the need to invoke significant amounts of liquid water			2
the valleys and outflow channels are believed to be many billion years old			0
professor @entity58 believes the lava would have been emitted by now - vanished volcanoes somewhere on the @entity19 plateau , forerunners of the region ’s ( relatively juvenile ) modern volcanoes			0
the @entity46 of @entity5 – @entity45 is pictured here			1
here lava tunnels seem to have collapsed , forming ' pit chains ' – long curvilinear depressions in the crust professor @entity58 believes that every stage of this volcanic erosion process is visible in the @entity125 images			2
the first stage , he concludes , can be seen in the locations closest to today ’s @entity19 volcanoes , at the western end of @entity45			2
here lava tunnels seem to have collapsed , forming ' pit chains ' – long curvilinear depressions in the crust			0
further east , where the terrain deepens , the pit chains seem to have been further eroded , by the injection of yet more lava , into more extensive channels – first into ' fossae ' and later into larger ' chasmata '			0
the @entity125 images showed relatively little evidence for the past presence of liquid water in the valleys and outflow channels , which can be inferred by the presence of ' light toned deposits ' in the images			2
this , professor @entity58 believes , adds further weight to the theory that these features are igneous in origin			0
while a volcanic origin for @entity5 ' valleys and outflow channels had been proposed before ( in the wake of @entity126 's @entity211 mission in the 1970s , this was actually the prevailing theory ) , for the past 25 years , scientific opinion has drifted towards an explanation involving a mixture of tectonic uplift and sedimentary erosion caused by water			1
the study is unlikely to change the @entity219 's travel plans			0
professor @entity58 ’s research , while intriguing , is far from conclusive , according to @entity1 researcher @entity0 the distinction between sedimentary and igneous rocks reaches far beyond geology			1
if , as the majority of scientists still believe , the valleys and outflow channels once contained significant volumes of water , then they are naturally prime candidates for future missions on the hunt for life			2
for instance , the @entity219 ’s @entity235 rover , due to touch down in 2019 , is considering landing sites around @entity45			2
if professor @entity58 ’s conclusion is accurate , however , and these features are instead mostly volcanogenic , this implies that much less water was present during their formation			1
if this turns out to be true , their suitability as landing sites could be called into question			1
this would not spell doom for the chances of finding life on @entity5			1
if professor @entity58 is right , it simply means that less liquid water existed in this particular corner of the planet			0
it would say little about @entity5 ' total water inventory			1
in any case , this study is unlikely to change the @entity219 's travel plans			0
professor @entity58 ’s research , while intriguing , is far from conclusive			0
it is notoriously tough to tell between igneous and sedimentary rocks using orbital images , even at the resolution offered by the @entity125			0
a definitive answer , then , will have to wait			0
but let ’s hope not at the cost of another expensive mission which comes up dry			0
@entity0 is a researcher in @entity270 at @entity1 , this article was originally published in @entity272 .			1

study look at gorges in @entity5 ' @entity276 and @entity45
it found water on @entity5 would not have been enough to carve canyons
instead , study claims canyons were formed by passage of volcanic rock
this implies that much less water was present during their formation
if this turns out to be true , @entity1 researcher @entity0 claims the suitability of these areas to search for life could be called into question
