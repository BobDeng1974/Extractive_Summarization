an @entity1 woman who died in a car crash overnight thursday is the girlfriend of the man killed by police while holding a bb gun in a @entity6			1
@entity7 , 26 — who is seen on tape weeping as police threaten her during an interview — had been traveling in @entity11 with @entity12 , 30 , when their car struck a pole and rolled about 3 pm			1
@entity15 and @entity12 were thrown nearly 100 from their vehicle , which landed on its top on a front yard near @entity20 at @entity21			1
' witnesses on scene gave us accounts that the vehicle was traveling approximately 90 to 100 mph , lost control , hit an @entity30 pole and then flipped several times , ' sgt. @entity22 , of the @entity23 , told @entity32			1
an officer from the @entity49 department repeatedly demands to know where the slain @entity50 , 22 , got his ' gun ' from in an interview with his weeping girlfriend , @entity7			1
@entity15 , who is not told until the end of the interview that her loved one has died , is clearly distressed by the line of question from the disbelieving officer , @entity60 , who repeatedly suggests she is lying			2
@entity60 , who warns @entity15 she could be jailed for what she says in the interview , also suggests that she looks ' messed up ' and could be drunk or high on drugs in footage obtained by the @entity68			2
@entity15 breaks down in tears several times in the interview following the august 5 incident , which focuses on the moments before @entity50 was shot dead after picking up a bb gun in the @entity6 outlet			1
questioning : @entity49 police officer @entity60 , right , is seen in the footage harshly questioning @entity7 , the girlfriend of @entity50 , who was shot dead by police in august repeated : @entity60 asks @entity15 again and again whether she knew @entity50 had a gun before going into the @entity6 where he was shot			1
in fact he did n't have a gun , and picked up a replica from a shelf a 911 caller had told police the replica gun was actually a real assault rifle , which led officer @entity88 to gun him down			1
a grand jury later decided not to indict him for the killing			0
@entity7 swore repeatedly on her own life , and the graves of her dead relatives , that she was being honest , despite @entity60 telling her she was phrasing her answers like ' someone not telling the truth ' , and saying he expected her testimony to change later			2
shot dead : @entity50 , pictured right with his mother , @entity100 , was killed after a 911 caller said he had a gun in the store moments before : @entity50 can be seen above moments before he is killed by officer @entity88 officer @entity60 : ' you and @entity50 went into @entity6 , at some point as i understand it , @entity50 produced a gun			1
you were with him just moments before that , were n't you ? ' @entity7 : yes , sir @entity60 : ok , tell me where he got the gun from			0
@entity15 : sir i do n't know - i honestly do n't know			0
@entity60 : and the truth is you knew at some point he did carry a gun , is n't it ? @entity15 : no sir , i did n't know			2
i swear i did n't know			0
@entity60 : you see , i 'm having trouble with this			0
@entity15 : [ through tears ] please , give me a lie detector test ! footage from 94 - minute interview , released to the news site by the @entity1 attorney general , shows @entity60 grilling @entity15 at length on her version of events , at times banging his hand on the table for emphasis			2
he also pursues a theory that @entity50 had taken his own , real , gun into the store in order to shoot his ex-girlfriend , @entity140			0
at one point he asks her : ' did he ever mention " i 'm gon na shoot that bitch " , or something like that ? ' @entity15 replied that he did n't , and that as far as she was aware she was in @entity147 and not in the store			0
although the grand jury concluded that the shooting was justified , federal officials are looking into the case			0
earlier this month it was reported that officer @entity88 , who also killed a man in 2010 , will remain on leave until after that investigation			0
