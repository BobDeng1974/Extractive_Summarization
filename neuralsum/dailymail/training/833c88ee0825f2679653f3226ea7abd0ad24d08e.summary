weapon : a similar ring to the one used in the savage attack which left an imprint on ms @entity8 for several weeks she said : ' he was being loud and overly flirtatious with one of my friends from work and she told me that he was making her uncomfortable			1
' i decided i was sick of his flirting			0
he had already broken my trust and i struggled to believe that he had only been texting those other girls			0
i made my mind up to end it with him when i got home			0
' after 13 months together , ms @entity8 ended the relationship and then went to bed			2
but as she was drifting off to sleep @entity13 crept in her bedroom and the next thing she remembers was him sitting on top of her , squeezing her neck			2

that ’s when he let go and instead started kicking and punching me			0
' you often hear of people saying that someone looked possessed , but in his eyes he looked like something else was making him do it to me			0
it was as if he had to do it , like something was forcing him			0
violence : the couple are pictured together in happier times			0
they were together for 13 months until ms @entity8 called off the relationship but @entity13 attacked her as she slept after creeping into her bedroom ' it was such shock to think that this man i had been in love with - and i had been completely besotted with him at one time - could be capable of doing that to me			1
' i remember him hitting me with the ring and i felt it against my skull			0
before he hit me again he took it off			0

bruising on ms @entity8 's arm			2
she remembers him hitting her with a ring and feeling it against her skull she said : ' the police wanted to put me in a refuge but i point - blank refused			2

' some male friends came with me to pick up some things and i arranged for my kids ’ father to have them for a few days as we share custody			0
' just half an hour after she left for a friend ’s house , ms @entity8 received a call from her panicked neighbour and was told how @entity13 was hammering on her door and shouting for her to come out			1

bruising behind ms @entity8 's ear			2
@entity13 tried to apologise after the attack but she ordered him to leave ms @entity8 said : ' i do n’t know what he intended to do with the axe and the balaclava but i guess he was n’t there to apologise			1
i hate to think what he might have been capable of			0

' ms @entity8 said : ' i did n’t go to the court case because he wrote to me from jail asking me to go			2
