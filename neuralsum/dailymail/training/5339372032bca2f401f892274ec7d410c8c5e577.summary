@entity1 defender @entity0 remembers @entity1 being written off during his first season at @entity3 before bouncing back to claim the title			1
now the @entity6 defender insists @entity8 's men can do the same			1
the shock 1 - 0 defeat to @entity11 10 days ago means the @entity13 champions have dropped 10 @entity14 points this season			1
@entity1 defender @entity0 is refusing to press the panic button despite his side 's worrying form @entity1 slumped to a shock 1 - 0 loss to @entity11 ; the @entity13 champions have dropped 10 points this season they trail table - topping accies by six points as they languish in sixth place , albeit having played a game less			1
that miserable start to the campaign has left their new @entity29 boss in the firing line of frustrated fans			0
but @entity0 says @entity1 can learn a lesson from the team which fought back from a 3 - 0 half - time deficit against @entity35 three years ago as they looked set to drop 18 points behind rivals @entity37			1
the full - back told the @entity39 : ' the main thing is to have a good team spirit			2
in my first season , we won the league and we won the league and we were 15 points behind at one stage , but just after @entity49 we were one point ahead			1
these are worrying times for @entity8 's men at @entity3 as @entity1 sit on sixth place in the @entity53 table ' a big turning point was the game at @entity35			1
being 3 - 0 down at half - time , people felt that was it and we were going to be 18 points behind in the league so it may have been too much			1
' but getting the three goals in the second half and getting the draw gave us a boost of confidence that we could go on a good run and that 's what happened			2
' so you need to have a good team spirit and stay together			0
that team were good at doing that and i 'm sure this one can be as well			0
' every time we lose , especially the next day , the atmosphere is n't great and we are all a bit quiet and down			0
' overall , though , the boys are upbeat and are looking good in training			0
in parts of the game against @entity11 , we looked like a good team , but we just need to do that for the full 90 minutes , and if we can do that then we can go on a long unbeaten run			1
' it 's a bad start for us but with the players we have , we can put a good run together and i 'm sure we can climb back up the league			2
' we just need to keep calm , keep doing what we are doing in training and then do that when we play at the weekend			0
' @entity0 is hoping to make his @entity1 return soon after missing the last six weeks with a groin injury			1
the 22 - year - old has not played since limping off at half - time during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity99 on august 31			2
the former @entity101 man - whose current side face @entity102 in @entity104 on saturday - said : ' it 's always frustrating being injured			2
' you obviously want to be out there helping the boys but i 'm sure we will get it together and click soon			0
' some of the football we have been playing has been good but we just have n't managed to get the results we have wanted			0
' i felt good in pre-season and the way the team was playing suits me as a full - back , so i was enjoying it			0
everyone gets injuries so i ca n't get too down about it and just need to try to get fit and back in the team			0
