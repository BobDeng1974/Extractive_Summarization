@entity0 is unlikely to have popped out the ' pop - out @entity0 ' souvenir from the match - day programme to place on his mantelpiece			2
he will not want any reminder of the occasion , his first reunion with @entity7			1
rather like his 1,000th @entity10 game , a 6 - 0 defeat at @entity12 , this turned out to be a long sentimental preamble followed by 90 disastrous minutes			2
@entity10 manager @entity0 ( right ) greets his opposite number , @entity15 of @entity7 the 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity7 has left @entity10 on the verge of @entity20 elimination @entity22 's ( left ) strike from range deflected in off @entity24 ( centre ) on 38 minutes @entity26 ( second right ) scored @entity7 's second with a composed finish under pressure @entity22 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity7 team - mates after putting his side ahead at the emirates @entity26 celebrates scoring @entity7 's second in front of a stunned @entity37 crowd he seemed utterly dejected as he tried to analyse the performance			1
all the recent glimmers of encouragement were washed away and what seemed a genuine chance to reach the last eight of the @entity20 for the first time in five years turned into one of the worst @entity47 performances of the @entity0 era			2
even after 15 years of elite @entity47 football , @entity10 still gallop headlong into these two - legged ties with astonishing naivety			2
with priorities all wrong , too loose at the back , without urgency on the ball , unable to prevent an away goal , over-committed to attack and unable to recognise the signs and adjust when things are going so badly it 's time cut losses			1
perhaps after routinely drawing powerhouses like @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 at this stage , they thought it was too easy			0
it had been received as a good draw when the teams were paired , back in december ; one @entity10 had dared to hope for , and then this â€¦ boom , to quote the firecracker launched from the away end as the travelling fans celebrated @entity26 scoring @entity7 's second of the night			1
@entity26 , a former @entity78 striker , had been jeered when he first touched the ball , but the home crowd seemed to have lost interest in such tactics of intimidation by the time he lashed the ball past @entity85 , early in the second half			1
do n't expect to see any jubilant ' selfies ' from the home dressing room to go viral after this one			0
for @entity0 and his players , thoughts quarter - finals suddenly seem a long way off against @entity15 's team who rarely leak goals even last night when they were without their entire first - choice back - four			1
@entity15 's team were well - drilled and composed in their defensive duties			2
the revitalised team from the millionaire 's paradise on the @entity103 parked the @entity104			0
then they suckered @entity10 on the break as they admired the wheels			0
@entity108 pulled a goal back for @entity10 in stoppage team with strike from the edge of the area @entity114 , the @entity7 goalkeeper , leaps to his left but is unable to keep out @entity108 's shot but with one of the final kicks of the game , @entity117 made the score 3 - 1 to @entity7 @entity7 have never lost to @entity123 opposition in the knock - out rounds of this competition and it will take a heroic effort from @entity0 's team in the second leg to buck that trend			1
@entity12 have fought back from 3 - 1 down to win at this stage of the @entity20 , twice in the last three years , but that was with the second leg at home			1
and , that was @entity12 , a mature team with strength and character			0
after watching this game , it is hard to imagine @entity10 keeping a clean sheet in the @entity141 as they pour forward in search of goals			0
the win at @entity145 offered encouragement but last night the defensive problems were back in full force , while in possession they lacked any urgency until @entity151 came on and the strikers misfired badly			0
@entity0 's decision to replace @entity154 was celebrated by home fans who hailed him a two goal - hero in the @entity157 against @entity158 on his last outing at the @entity37			1
it is a painfully delicate balance inside the @entity10 family			0
on came @entity108 to join @entity162 in one of the holding midfield partnerships you thought you would never see			2
it was a night to forget for @entity10 's players , as they slumped to a @entity20 defeat against @entity7 @entity154 was unable to inspire @entity10 in an underwhelming performance from @entity0 's side @entity171 ( centre ) lifted a good chance over the bar in the early exchanges of @entity10 against @entity7 @entity0 was frantically gambling long before his team set foot in @entity178			1
no sooner had @entity108 pulled one back to offer a lifeline , than @entity10 fell to pieces again and gifted @entity7 the third			1
after months of planning since the draw in december , this was such a hastily scrambled mess			0
the original midfield pairing of @entity162 and @entity186 , so impressive and well balanced since it came together , was missing as @entity7 took the lead			1
a ripple of discontent washed around the @entity37 , an oh - no - not - again ripple			0
this place has yet to witness any of those truly great @entity47 nights which @entity192 enjoyed			0
perhaps until it does , it will always seem strangely cold and corporate			0
there were times last night when the away fans made more noise , with their colour - coordinated plastic ponchos , which had the pleasing effect of producing a large @entity7 flag			1
for @entity0 this was @entity20 match number 161			0
his status as one of the iconic modern coaches was underlined by the build - up to a game which was all about him			2
@entity7 's supporters wore colour - coordinated ponchos that displayed the @entity7 flag @entity10 defender and captain @entity24 was not his usual authoritative self for his team on wednesday @entity212 ( left ) of @entity10 tries to deliver a cross as @entity7 's @entity214 ( right ) tries to close down @entity154 was substituted after an hour after a hapless display from the striker as @entity10 lost to @entity7 but the nearest he has ever been to lifting this trophy came in @entity219 , nine years ago , when a team reduced to ten men , could not cling on to a lead and were beaten by @entity65			1
this morning , after such a sobering night , those giddy heights seem unlikely to be scaled again			0
will he ever win it ? the dream is fading .			0

@entity22 's deflected strike in the 38th minute put @entity7 ahead
@entity26 *doubled* the lead , clinically finishing a *counter* attack
@entity108 pulled a goal back in stoppage time
but @entity117 made it 3 - 1 in the final seconds of the game
