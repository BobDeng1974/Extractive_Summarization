the mammoth effort to transport four @entity2 elephants almost 400km has already kicked off ahead of their trip from @entity5 to @entity6 later this year			1
@entity7 and @entity8 along with their calves @entity9 and @entity11 will be packed into special crates and transported by road from @entity14 to @entity15			1
months ahead of their trip , staff at @entity14 have started the process of familiarising them with their temporary homes for a few hours en route to their destination			0
at the moment the zoo has two @entity2 elephants , @entity35 and @entity36 , are over the age for breeding			1
@entity35 is 60 years old and @entity36 is 57 years old			0
a 750sq m extension at @entity15 will include a new elephant barn and two extra paddocks in the purpose - built breeding habitat on top two other elephant barns , pools , mud wallows and shade structures			1
it has been designed so the two young male calves can move away when they are weened off their mothers , which reflects what would happen in the wild			0
female elephants , known as cows , usually stay with their young in herds , but male elephants - called bulls - usually live alone			2
they will take part in the zoo 's first ever breeding program and join two other @entity2 elephants they will be transported almost 400km by road in special crates when the kids fly the coop , @entity14 elephant manager @entity66 said the mothers would get ' a new lease on life '			1
' they ’re going to relax tremendously because right now they ’re looking over their shoulders all the time about what the young bulls are going to do , ' he said			0
' are they going to sneak up on them or are they going to play fight or whatever ? ' a lot of the time it ’s good fun but they always have to be on their guard because when a young bull decides he wants to have fun who knows when that could be because it could be in the middle of the night , so they ’re always a little bit on guard about that			0
' preparations for the @entity2 elephants ' transfer have already started with them being introduced to special crates			1
one of the mothers , @entity100 , took quite a liking to the the box			2
the elephants ' names are @entity100 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 the purpose - built breeding grounds will have a 750sq m extension built on it ' @entity108 we call her our go - go girl because she likes to go places , ' mr @entity66 said			1
' when we brought the new crate into the barn she was itching to get over to it and to see what it was all about and get into it so again she likes to go see new things			0
' the redevelopment of the elephant facility is due for completion late 2014			0
the plan is for the elephants from @entity14 to arrive late 2014 or earlier 2015			0
the improved facility in @entity6 is expected to be finished by late 2014			2

elephants @entity100 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 will move to @entity6
this means @entity15 can now start breeding @entity2 elephants
