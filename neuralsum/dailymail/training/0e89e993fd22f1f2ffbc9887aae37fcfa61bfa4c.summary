by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has revealed @entity4 duo @entity3 and @entity5 were influential in him making the similar switch to @entity7 this summer			1
the right - back followed his @entity10 compatriots to the @entity12 champions on a free after declining several contract offers in @entity14			0
and after seeing the success @entity3 and @entity5 have enjoyed , @entity2 says it was an easy decision to make once he was sure he wanted to leave the @entity17			1
advice : @entity2 says @entity3 and @entity5 ( below ) helped him leave @entity19 for @entity7 friendship : the trio have played with eachother for @entity23 , @entity19 , and now the @entity12 champions ' yes , i spoke to them [ @entity3 and @entity5 ] many times , @entity2 told mcfc.co.uk in his first interview with the club			1
' they knew i was free and wanted to move , and told me to come because they have a great team with a great mentality , who work hard and win trophies			1
@entity2 is believed to have been offered a Â£ 150,000 - a - week package to join @entity7 , where he will battle with @entity38 to be first choice			2
a more comfortable season as regular right - back could have been in store for the 31 - year - old with @entity44 at @entity19 , but he claims he needed to ' start from the bottom ' to challenge himself again			1
happy to be here : @entity2 is shown around the @entity47 ' starting from the bottom ' : @entity2 meets new manager @entity49 at a @entity51 training session ' i needed a change , i spent seven years at @entity19 and i had great times there but i wanted to start from the bottom again and work hard again ' when you come into a team like this it 's not hard to motivate yourself , i watched them celebrate last season and three years ago and i wanted to celebrate too			1
' @entity7 's pre-season has largely been peen played in the @entity64 this summer , where they featured in the @entity65			0
@entity2 has only just returned to training after his @entity68 exploits , and may miss out on the club 's last ' friendly ' , the @entity70 against former club @entity19 at @entity71 on sunday			2
no sentimentality : @entity2 says @entity19 are just another club for @entity7 to beat in the @entity12 he wo n't have to wait long to meet his former team - mates again though , with the two clubs due to meet at the @entity75 in the fourth game of the season			2
not one from sentimentality , @entity2 says he wo n't treat the game any differently			0
asked if the date was penciled in his diary , he replied : ' not at all			0
@entity19 are one of the other teams who we have to play and beat			0
my team is @entity7 and i will give the maximum			0

@entity2 says once he knew he wanted to leave , @entity3 and @entity5 *stepped* in
*convinced* him that the club has great mentality and will win trophies
hopes for *healthy* *competition* with right - back @entity38
says he needed a change from @entity19 , to ' start from the bottom ' again
asked if he had penciled in fixture with the @entity17 in his diary , says : ' not at all . @entity19 are one of the other teams who we have to play and beat . '
