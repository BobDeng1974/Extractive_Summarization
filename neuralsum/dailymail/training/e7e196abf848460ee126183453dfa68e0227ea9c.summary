denial : his conviction remained even though she recanted her statement on video the following year ( pictured ) after her grandmother , right , took her to authorities			0

@entity8 was taken in for questioning on october 29 1997			0
there was no definitive forensic evidence to prove @entity11 had been raped , but the little girl and her mother 's story - together with some suspect answers @entity8 provided during questioning - were enough for officers to charge the father of five			1
