the full - time whistle was still echoing inside a rapidly emptying @entity1 when a @entity3 classic boomed from the @entity4			2
according to denim - clad @entity5 , this is ‘ the season of love and understanding ’			1
but then old @entity7 never had the @entity9 annual general meeting in mind			2
confirmation last night that @entity12 had been placed on gardening leave for the remainder of his contract adds a whole new dimension to what was always going to be a fractious event			1
@entity12 's departure , nine days after he offered his resignation , leaves more questions than it answers the atmosphere is likely to be far from festive when the board sits in front of rank - and - file shareholders in the @entity28 main stand this morning			1
goodwill and charity are in scant supply among supporters angered by so much that has already happened and anxious about what comes next			2
there was a school of thought that @entity12 ’s presence at the meeting would be requested , almost to act as a lightning rod by deflecting some of the voltage away from the directors			1
that was ruled out when the end of his three - and - a - half - year tenure in charge — a spell unlike any other in the 142 years since @entity9 were founded — was signalled in a club statement			1
fittingly , given the current circumstances at @entity1 , the move both removed — and added — uncertainty			2
despite declarations of business as usual , the idea of @entity12 serving out his 12 - month notice period was always unrealistic			1
it simply could n’t work			0
@entity58 ( right ) has taken over from @entity12 but is unlikely to be a long term solution at @entity9 rangers have now stated that assistant manager @entity61 will be in charge until the end of the season			1
but then @entity61 is no more part of the emerging new regime at @entity1 than @entity12 was			1
the club ’s desperate financial position severely limits their current options			1
it would seem logical , however , to predict that the next permanent manager will have @entity73 ’s seal of approval			1
indeed , @entity73 will join @entity12 in casting a shadow over monday 's annual meeting despite not being present in person			1
@entity73 , like @entity12 , will be conspicuous in his absence at monday 's @entity78 his close ally , @entity79 , will be there after being upgraded from non-executive director to chief executive last friday			1
but it remains to be seen whether any gifts of clarity about the way ahead will arrive from the top table			0
@entity73 is the only man capable of playing @entity88 at @entity1 these days , albeit his sack of goodies comes plastered with sports direct branding			2
approval for a new share issue underwritten by the @entity95 owner would help plug the £ 8million funding gap faced next year			0
it would also create a further issue in terms of @entity73 ’s past understanding with the @entity101 over his shareholding and influence			0
yet if @entity9 argue that @entity73 is their single hope of solvency , then the governing body will be wedged between a rock and a hard place when it comes to renegotiating that agreement			0
whatever unfolds on monday , it will draw far more of a response from those filling the blue seats than saturday ’s pallid 2 - 0 victory over @entity116			0
this was n’t exactly a valedictory triumph to savour , but at least @entity12 can say he bowed out on a winning note			1
rangers beat @entity121 2 - 0 on saturday , and sit second in the @entity123 table after 17 games there were , however , no audible chants of support for him from those fans who bothered to turn up			2
or , indeed , much noise about anything else			0
the official attendance of 28,053 could barely be delivered with a straight face			0
that figure presumes that all season - ticket holders had attended			2
in truth , it looked safe to lop around 10,000 off the total			0
one group in the @entity141 stand did direct some ire towards the directors , but it failed to catch on in other parts of the stadium			0
it feels almost as if the club has been placed in suspended animation			2
the players have seemed to be part of that on too many occasions			0
for all that it becomes a mantra from within the dressing room , it is surely stretching credibility to think they can be unaffected by what goes on around them			0
the build - up to the @entity116 game must have been another strange affair after @entity12 handed in his notice 10 days ago			1
@entity167 ( left ) ensured @entity12 departed @entity9 on a winning note after three and a half years in charge ‘ it ’s been hard and difficult , but as a player , you can only influence what you do when you cross that white line , ’ said defender @entity170 , speaking on saturday evening			1
‘ so , for us , it ’s been training as normal and we ’ve been listening to the experienced boys like @entity179 [ @entity180 ] and @entity61 [ @entity181 ] , who make sure we ’ re all on the right track			1
‘ you just train hard and look forward to the next game because that ’s what it all boils down to			0
we need to keep focused to get results and climb up the table			0
’ a fine , angled finish from @entity167 had @entity9 ahead at the break against the @entity123 ’s bottom side			0
the winger ’s second - half cross was then turned into his own net by @entity196 to complete the scoring in a very forgettable affair .			0

@entity12 finally left the club nine days after offering his resignation
assistant @entity61 will take over as manager until end of season
fans have been left angry and *disengaged* by the club 's situation
