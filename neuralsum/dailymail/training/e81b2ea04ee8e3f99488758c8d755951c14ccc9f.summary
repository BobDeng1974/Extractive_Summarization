by @entity0 and @entity1 seeking to ratchet up pressure on @entity5 president @entity4 , president @entity2 said the @entity6 levied news sanctions on monday on @entity5 individuals and companies in retaliation for @entity12 's alleged provocations in @entity13			1
targets of the sanctions include @entity5 government officials and high - technology exports to @entity5 's defense industry			1
' the goal here is not to go after mr. @entity4 personally , ' @entity2 said			1
' the goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he 's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the @entity5 economy over the long haul			1
' these officials will have their @entity6 visas banned and their assets frozen			0
meanwhile , 17 companies linked to @entity4 will have their assets frozen			0
of those 17 companies , @entity39 will further sanction 13 by disallowing exports from the @entity6 to those companies			0
the statement did neither specified which government officials nor @entity5 companies would be sanctioned			2
the @entity55 will also begin denying export applications for any ' high - technology items that could contribute to @entity59 € ™ s military capabilities			0
' existing export licenses in that category will be revoked , according to the @entity36 's statement			0
@entity36 press secretary @entity63 said the @entity6 is prepared to ' impose still greater costs on @entity5 if the @entity5 leadership continues these provocations			1
' future sanctions could affect individuals and businesses working in @entity5 's financial services , energy , metals and mining , engineering and defense industries			1
in a statement to @entity77 , @entity5 's deputy minister for foreign relations @entity79 called the sanctions ' meaningless , shameful , and disgusting			1
' ' the goal here is not to go after mr. @entity4 personally , ' @entity2 said			1
' the goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he 's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the @entity5 economy over the long haul			1
' @entity2 announced the sanctions during a news conference in the @entity94 , his final stop on a four - country @entity97 swing			1
the president has been building a case for this round of penalties throughout his trip , both in his public comments and in private conversations with @entity106 leaders			0
the new sanctions are intended to build on earlier @entity6 and @entity106 visa bans and asset freezes imposed on @entity5 officials , including many in @entity4 's inner circle , after @entity12 annexed the @entity113 from @entity13 last month			1
@entity36 officials say they decided last week to impose additional penalties after determining that @entity5 had not lived up to its commitments under a fragile diplomatic accord aimed at easing the crisis in @entity13			2
but the @entity6 held off on implementing the sanctions in order to coordinate its actions with the @entity121 , which could also announce new penalties as early as monday			2
@entity2 announced the sanctions during a news conference in the @entity94 , his final stop on a four - country @entity97 swing			1
the failed diplomatic agreement reached in @entity126 just over a week ago called on the @entity127 to use its influence to get @entity130 insurgents to leave the government buildings they have occupied in eastern @entity13			0
but those forces have not only balked at leaving those buildings , but have also stepped up their provocations , including capturing @entity106 military observers who were paraded by the militants before the media sunday			0
despite the deteriorating situation , @entity2 said @entity5 still has the opportunity to resolve the @entity13 crisis through a diplomatic path			2
but he voiced pessimism about whether the new sanctions package would be enough to change @entity4 's calculus			2
' we do n't yet know whether it 's going to work , ' he said			0
@entity148 spokeswoman @entity147 told reporters during her daily briefing on monday that the @entity6 had not seen any signs from @entity5 that it would begin abiding by the @entity126 agreement			0
the @entity121 is @entity5 's biggest trading partner , giving it much greater economic leverage over @entity12 than the @entity6 has			1
however , the @entity121 treads more carefully in imposing sanctions since @entity5 is also one of its biggest oil and gas suppliers			0
@entity106 diplomats were set to meet in @entity161 on monday to discuss slapping asset freezes and travel bans on more officials associated with @entity5 's actions on @entity13			2
