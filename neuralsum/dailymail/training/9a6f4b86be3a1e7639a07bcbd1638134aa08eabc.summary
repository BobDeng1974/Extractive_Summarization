@entity0 was the only @entity1 to win on his 100th cap on friday , @entity3 becomes the 12th man to play 100 tests for @entity6 aiming to overtake @entity8 ’s record by maintaining the best batting form of his life			1
@entity3 would need to play for another four years if he is going to surpass the ‘ gaffer ’s ’ tally of 133 caps but , at 32 , he is young enough and fit enough to do so if he can play a leading , responsible role in @entity6 ’s brave new world			1
‘ i hope i can get there because i feel as though i ’m batting as well as i ’ ve ever done in an @entity6 shirt , ’ said @entity3 at @entity17			1
hopefully that ’s just the start and i think there is more to come			0
‘ if i stay fit i want to play for @entity6 as long as i can			1
it was all i wanted to do as a kid and i ’ve been very lucky to have been able to do it for so long			0
you do n’t want to give that shirt up			0
’ this landmark seemed a long way away when @entity3 was dropped at the start of the last new era after @entity6 had been bowled out for 51 in @entity48 early in 2009			1
‘ there were times when i doubted i would get this far , ’ admitted @entity3			2
turning point : @entity3 was dropped after @entity6 were humiliated by the @entity53 in @entity48 , 2009 unfinished business : @entity3 did not want to spend the rest of his career playing county cricket alone ‘ that @entity53 tour was the turning point			1
when you get dropped you ask questions of yourself			0
’ the answers he came up with saw him become a much more resilient member of the @entity6 side when he regained his place during the @entity65 later that year			2
‘ i started to score runs when the team really needed them and that ’s what i needed to do , ’ said @entity3 , now @entity6 ’s unofficial vice-captain			1
‘ maybe in my early days i took the easy option too often			0
i remember the guys walking out at @entity71 at the start of that 2009 summer while i was at @entity73 and i just had this feeling that i did n’t want to just play county cricket			0
i had unfinished business and when i got my next chance with @entity6 i did n’t want to let it go			2
’ in from the cold : @entity3 regained his place at the 2009 ashes and has not looked back since revenge ? : @entity3 is bowled out by @entity80 in the 1st @entity82 test match at @entity71 @entity3 credited the @entity83 at @entity84 and sacked @entity6 batting coach @entity85 as the biggest influences on his career outside his family			1
‘ i wish @entity89 could be here on friday with me , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ he was somebody who got me to where i am now and @entity85 is probably as close as i ’ve come to the relationship i had with @entity89			0
they saw the game very similarly and gave me a lot of honest feedback			0
it will certainly be nice to share a beer with @entity0 at some point			2
’ of the previous 11 @entity6 players to play 100 times only @entity0 was in the winning side on his landmark @entity103 , and even he never played in another after his 100th cap against @entity105			1
@entity3 hopes to buck the trend			0
‘ this week is exciting and it ’s about winning rather than my 100th test , ’ he said			0
‘ i will look back on four winning @entity65 series and winning in @entity110 when i finish but i still think there are more special things round the corner			0
’ buck the trend ? @entity0 was the only man to win on his landmark 100th cap			1

@entity3 will become the 12th man to reach 100 caps for @entity6
@entity8 ' @entity120 holds the record with 133 caps for @entity6
@entity3 was dropped after @entity6 were humiliated by the @entity53 in 2009
@entity0 was the only @entity1 to win on his 100th cap
