rapped : @entity2 's ' @entity1 ' advertising campaign has been banned for a second time after the advertising watchdog ruled it was misleading @entity2 has been rapped by the advertising watchdog for a second time after @entity7 complained that the discount retailer 's ' @entity1 ' price comparisons were flawed			1
in tv and press adverts for the campaign shoppers spoke about swapping from their usual supermarket to @entity2 , with one saying : ' we 've saved so much on our weekly shop			2
' after an investigation , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) agreed @entity2 offered savings , but it banned the adverts after ruling they exaggerated how many people had taken part in the challenge			1
the decision came after @entity7 complained that the comparison was misleading because it believed the eight - week comparison period was out of date and invalid for a price sensitive market			1
@entity34 's biggest grocery chain also said weekly shops were not compared on a like - for - like basis , the selection of items to include or exclude was arbitrary and explanatory information in the adverts was not prominent enough			0
it noted the adverts stated 84 out of 98 people saved , and that the challenge was based on four weeks ' shopping at a competitor and then four weeks shopping at @entity2 , but it understood that only four of the 98 individuals had undertaken the eight - week challenge and the remaining 94 had undertaken the challenge over two weeks			1
@entity2 said @entity1 differed from traditional comparative advertising as it looked at overall shopping costs at a single store over an extended time rather than the prices of individual products or a standardised basket			2
it said comparing individual products would therefore have been artificial because consumers did not buy the same items every week			0
it said the campaign fully compared the actual overall weekly shop of individuals over a lengthy period and was fair , transparent and verifiable			0
the @entity18 said it was acceptable for @entity2 to run a price comparison campaign based on consumers shopping normally with a competitor for four weeks and then with itself for the same time			1
but it believed consumers would assume that 98 people had participated in the eight - week challenge , when in fact only four people had			1
it also found inconsistencies in how items had been included or excluded , with some non-grocery or high - ticket items such as dishwasher salt , truffles and @entity75 pudding excluded from one shop and included in another			0
complaint : the decision came after @entity7 complained that comparisons were misleading because it believed the eight - week comparison period was out of date and invalid for a price sensitive market the @entity18 did its own calculations , taking into account items it believed should have been included and excluded , and allowing for inconsistencies and inaccuracies in @entity2 's interpretation of the data			1
the watchdog said they still showed savings in the original shops ranged from 22 per cent to 33 per cent			0
moreover savings for a shorter ' revalidation ' trial ranged between 25 per cent and 38 per cent			0
it concluded : ' we considered those amounts represented significant savings at the time of both the original shops and the revalidation shop , and therefore that the overall message of the @entity1 campaign , that consumers could save money by shopping at @entity2 , was not misleading to consumers			0
' nonetheless , because we considered the way in which the comparison was presented in the ads implied more people had participated in the eight - week challenge than was the case , we concluded the ads were in breach of the codes			1
' the adverts must not appear again in their current form , it ruled			0
' we told @entity119 to ensure that in future the basis for comparisons was made clear and did not mislead , and that their comparisons were verifiable , ' the @entity18 said			2
@entity2 's joint managing director of corporate buying , @entity124 , said : ' it is important to be clear that the @entity18 has endorsed the validity of the @entity1 campaign			2
' we recognise that the decision to uphold competitor representations was technical in its nature and , because of this , we will respect the finding and have addressed the issues that it raised			0
' earlier this year , the @entity18 banned a tv advert for @entity1 following a complaint from @entity137 , warning @entity2 to make the basis of its comparisons clear in future .			2

but advertising watchdog rules shopping at the discounter is still *cheaper*
ads ' ' implied ' 84 people had saved over an eight - week challenge , says @entity18
in *reality* just four people took part in the full challenge
