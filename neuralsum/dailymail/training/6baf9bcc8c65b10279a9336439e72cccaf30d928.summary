an impatient commuter probably regretted telling a man to ' f * * * himself ' on a busy train when he arrived at a job interview later that day to find his fellow passenger was the head of recruitment			1
@entity9 executive @entity8 claimed the job seeker pushed past him and launched a foul - mouthed tirade as they were both getting off a packed rush - hour train on monday morning			1
he said he stood to one side to let a woman off the train as it pulled into @entity18 in central @entity19 , but the job hunter thought he was deliberately standing in the way			0
hours later , the same man walked in for an interview with mr @entity8 at investment firm @entity24			1
@entity9 executive @entity8 found himself interviewing the same man who launched a foul - mouthed tirade at him earlier the same day ' i was on my way into work on the tube on monday morning during rush hour			1
i stood to one side to let a lady get by , and ended up blocking a man momentarily			0
' i think he thought i was just standing in his way			0
he pushed and i turned , i explained i was getting off too but he pushed past and then looked back and suggested i might like to f * * * myself â€¦ which might have been true but not before a few cups of coffee , ' he told @entity38			2
despite the heated exchange , the job seeker did not recognise his interviewer as soon as he arrived			2
so mr @entity8 asked him a few tube - related questions until the penny dropped			1
he then shared the awkward encounter on @entity45 and his original tweet has been favourited 14,000 times and re-tweeted more than 15,000 times			0
' @entity49 - the guy who pushed past me on the tube and then suggested i go @entity52 myself just arrived for his interview ... with me			0
he then said : ' i 'm not sure he realised until the very end ... very awkward ! mr @entity8 had stood to one side to let a woman off the train as it pulled into @entity18 in central @entity19 , but the job hunter thought he was deliberately standing in the way and shouted at him ' i think it crept up on him slowly as my questions became more and more tube related			1
' the job seeker ' laughed it off ' and carried on with the interview for the role of web developer at the firm			2
but he was not offered the job as mr @entity8 said he was not right for the role			1
' it would be easy to hold something like this over someone in an interview , but for me interviews are n't about that , ' said mr @entity8			1
' by the end of the interview we laughed it off and we 're both happy			0
' ' when you interview you are looking for a read of skills but also to know if that person is a real human being , it 's about that @entity90 the end of the interview we laughed it off and were both happy			0
' the candidate did n't get the job , though , and maybe now he 'll maintain a better attitude in the morning since he just might need some help from a fellow commuter one day			2
