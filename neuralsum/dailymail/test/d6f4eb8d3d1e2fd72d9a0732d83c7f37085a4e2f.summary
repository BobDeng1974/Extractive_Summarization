thunderbirds aired here between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002			0
there were 32 50 - minute episodes over two series , shown in 66 countries			2
the show spawned a merchandising frenzy , with more than 3,000 @entity4 products , from puppets and lunchboxes to t - shirts , so much so that december 1966 was dubbed @entity50			1
this is not , however the first attempt at a remake			0
@entity4 , a 2004 @entity55 film with real actors ( including @entity57 as arch - villain @entity58 ) , was an unmitigated disaster , losing almost £ 20 million at the box office			1
even @entity61 , the show ’s co-creator , called it ‘ the biggest load of c * * p ’ he had seen and rejected an offer of £ 400,000 for just going to the premiere			2
‘ remaking something as iconic as @entity4 means that your feelings of excitement are mixed with apprehension because you do n’t want to do anything to tarnish it , ’ says @entity68 , the show ’s executive producer			1
‘ we did n’t want to mess too much with @entity4 but needed to make it in a way that would excite 21st - century children			1
’ in a nod to 21st - century political correctness , there are also more women and several multicultural characters have been added as with the original , at the heart of @entity4 are the five gung - ho @entity89 brothers , all named after real astronauts on @entity94 ’s @entity93 space mission in the early 1960s : @entity97 ( @entity96 ) , @entity99 ( @entity98 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , @entity103 ( @entity102 ) and @entity104 ( @entity105 )			1

@entity61 and his wife @entity158 came up with @entity4 after a mining disaster in @entity160 in 1963			2
on the original show everyone had to multi-task ; for @entity158 that meant voicing @entity0 , @entity4 ’s @entity163 agent			1
@entity28 says she did n’t hesitate when she was offered the role			0
‘ as soon as @entity6 asked me , ’ she says , ‘ i knew it would be very exciting			2
‘ @entity0 often plays up to the frivolous elements of who she is — a girl who loves clothes , pink cars , little dogs — to blindside people and conceal what she really is up to at any given point that is usually breaking in somewhere she should n’t be , finding secrets in dangerous situations			2
’ her car is no longer a @entity179 ( no brands are used in children ’s television programmes now ) , but thankfully she still has @entity1			2
‘ the producers met me for coffee , ’ says @entity32			0
‘ i think they wanted to see what sort of shape i ’m in , but i was thrilled to be able to recreate this character			0

’ @entity1 returns with his original voice , that of 89 - year - old @entity32 , but has dropped his chauffeur uniform ( pictured ) and now sports a roll - neck sweater with swept - back , grey - streaked hair @entity1 has retained his distinctive cockney - trying - to - be - snooty accent			1
@entity32 says : ‘ @entity61 took me to lunch and said : “ i want you to listen to the wine waiter			0
” so the waiter came over and asked if we would like to see the wine list and he just had this great accent			0
i ’m not sure he knew we modelled the voice on him			0
’ there has been a concerted effort to increase the female and multicultural roles in the show to make it appeal to aspirational girls and boys of all races			2
