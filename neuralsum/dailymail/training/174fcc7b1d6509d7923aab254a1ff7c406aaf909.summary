a lemon - sized skull unearthed in @entity2 is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in @entity5			1
it belongs to a distant relative of @entity8 , called @entity9 , which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck - sized ancestors			1
the discovery could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved their fierce facial features			1
scroll down for interactive module a lemon - sized skull unearthed in @entity2 is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in @entity5			1
it belongs to a distant relative of @entity8 , called @entity9 , which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck - sized ancestors experts have struggled for decades to reconstruct the early evolutionary history of @entity24 – herbivorous , beaked dinosaurs - in @entity5 , because of a limited fossil record , but this latest discovery could shed new light			1
the dinosaur name means ‘ @entity32 face ’			2
it would have weighed just three pounds ( 1.4kg ) , and was the size of a small cat , measuring just two feet long ( 61cm ) , according to the study published in @entity37			0
it lived in the @entity39 - around 108 million years ago			1
its diminutive size contrasts with its later , and more famous relative , @entity8 , which weighed 4,000 times more			1
@entity43 ’ skull , which measures just 3.3 inches ( 8.4cm ) long , has a distinctive hooked beak - like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks ( illustrated ) record : @entity48 is the earliest known horned dinosaur species in @entity5			1
name : the animal 's latin name means @entity32 face			2
skull features : a distinctive hooked beak - like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks			0
age : the creature lived in the @entity39			0
the fossil is thought to be 108 million years old			2
weight : three lbs ( 1.4kg )			0
size : two ft long ( 61cm )			0
family : it 's a distant relative of @entity8			1
relevance : the fossil could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved			1
discovery : the fossil was unearthed in 1997 in @entity2			0
@entity71 ’ skull measures just over three inches ( 8cm ) long , and has a distinctive hooked beak - like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks			0
the dinosaur lacks the later species ’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘ no frills , ’ experts at the @entity77 in @entity78 said			0
the fossil was discovered by a team of paleontologists led by @entity87 in 1997 , and the dinosaur is now considered the oldest member of the horned dinosaur lineage in @entity5			2
@entity90 , the from @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , who led the study , told the @entity95 that the animal is closely related to similar species in @entity98			0
‘ @entity99 lived nearly 20 million years before the next oldest horned dinosaur named from @entity5			2
‘ even so , we were surprised that it was more closely related to @entity98 animals than those from @entity5			0
’ experts predict that by studying other horned fossil records , they will find that the ancestors of @entity43 may have come from @entity98			2
the dinosaur lacks the later species ’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘ no frills , ’ according to one expert			0
a 3d - printed version of the skill is pictured on a @entity8 ' skull , to give people an idea of how small the newly - discovered dinosaur was the fossil record suggests horned dinosaurs arose in @entity98 and spread to @entity5 near the @entity121 by about 108 million years ago - the age of @entity43			1
surprisingly , however , the study places @entity71 near the base of this tree , removed from horn - bearing triceratops and other relatives ( diagram pictured ) if this proves true , it would support theories of an ‘ intercontinental migratory event ’ between @entity98 and @entity5 , which palaeontologists think may have occurred in the @entity134 , between 113 million and 105 million years ago			0
experts have created @entity136 of the dinosaur and will add details to it as they learn more about the prehistoric creature			0
the skull itself will be featured in a new exhibit in the museum ’s @entity144 and will sit alongside its @entity146 , which holds the @entity147 for being the largest dinosaur skull ever found			2
the dinosaur ( illustrated ) , whose name means ‘ @entity32 face ’ would have weighed just three pounds ( 1.4kg ) , and was the size of a small cat , measuring just two feet long ( 61cm ) , according to the study the skull , unearthed in @entity2 is the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in @entity5			1
outcrops of @entity158 within the @entity159 of @entity2 and @entity160 are shown in orange @entity8 ( pictured ) first appeared in the late @entity163 period , about 68 million years ago and unlike its earlier relative , was the size of a truck			1
a scale model being crafted for the film @entity169 , is shown			0

108 million - year old skull of @entity43 *americanus* was found in @entity2
name means ' american eagle face ' and it would have weighed 3lbs ( 1.4kg )
@entity177 comes from the earliest horned dinosaur found on the continent
it 's an earlier , distant relative of @entity8 , but weighed 4,000 times less
find could help experts understand how horned dinosaurs evolved
