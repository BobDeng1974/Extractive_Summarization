a teenager has been suspended from school after teachers mistook her non-alcoholic shandy for a bottle of lager			2
@entity6 , 13 , was in a @entity8 lesson when she put the bottle of @entity11 ’s @entity10 on her desk while unpacking her school books			1
but teachers immediately confiscated the 500ml drink and within minutes she was sent home after being excluded for three days			1
controversy : @entity6 , 13 , who has been suspended from @entity17 for bringing in the drink she claims staff at @entity17 considered the soft drink to be alcohol - despite the product ’s website stating it is suitable for children			1
the alcohol content of the drink is less than 0.5 per cent - not enough to legally qualify as an intoxicating liquor and it is sold in the soft drinks aisle in shops			1
ms @entity31 , who has never been excluded before , said : ‘ i could n’t believe it			2
‘ you see kids at school drinking it all the time , even the @entity38 , there is nothing wrong with it			0
‘ the teachers told me i was n’t allowed to bring it into school because it is lager			2
i told them it was pop but they just would n’t listen			0
’ anger : @entity6 's mother , @entity45 ( right ) , has described her suspension as ' absurd ' and complained that she is now behind with her lessons @entity11 ’s @entity48 contains 12 per cent beer but is sold in the soft drink aisle in shops			1
no @entity52 is needed to buy it and it is officially classed as a soft drink by the @entity55			2
her mother @entity45 , 38 , said the incident on wednesday was ‘ absolutely ludicrous ’			0
‘ it is absurd , the staff were saying it was alcohol			0
‘ she has missed quite a few lessons now , it is ridiculous			0
she is special needs so she is dropping behind even more			0
safe : the shandy that ms @entity31 brought into school contains less than 0.5 per cent alcohol and is sold in the soft drinks sections of shops ‘ it find it absolutely ludicrous that she is missing out on education because of a bottle of pop. ‘ despite the fact we have explained , and proven , that it is not alcohol the school wo n’t listen at all			1
’ the stay - at - home mum - of - nine added : ‘ there is nothing wrong with taking that drink into school at all			0
‘ i tried to explain that it was my mistake and i bought it from the supermarket but that was not good enough			0
’ @entity88 , interim headteacher at @entity17 , defended the exclusion			1
he said : ‘ this school and all schools never exclude a student lightly or for trivial reasons			0
schools have a duty of care to ensure all students are kept safe			0
’ a @entity11 ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity98 with less than 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume are defined as soft drinks and as such have no restriction on their sale or consumption			1
‘ all products we manufacture under the shandy name are less than 0.5 per cent and this is stated on labelling			1

@entity6 , 13 , brought @entity11 's @entity10 to a *classroom*
the product 's website describes it as being suitable for children
it 's less than 0.5 per cent alcohol , not enough to be classed intoxicating
teachers at @entity17 excluded her for three days
