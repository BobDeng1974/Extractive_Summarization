by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 13 february 2013 @entity1 today unveiled plans to replace young offender institutions with ' secure colleges ' young offender institutions will be closed down and replaced with ‘ secure colleges ’ , under radical plans unveiled by @entity1 today			1
the justice secretary will invite private schools to bid to run the new centres , which have been inspired by the government ’s free schools policy			1
it raises the prospect of schools such as @entity16 helping to put tearaways back on the straight and narrow			2
mr @entity1 wants teenage criminals to spend their time in custody learning how to read and write and passing exams – not sitting in a cell brooding			1
up to £ 200,000 a year is spent housing a young burglar or mugger in a young offender institution ( @entity27 ) – more than five times the cost of a place at @entity16			1
mr @entity1 argues this is a waste of money when a staggering three - quarters of inmates reoffend upon release			1
he will say today : ‘ we can not go on just doing more of the same , pouring more money into a system which does n’t work in the hope of a different outcome			0
‘ that does n’t make any sense to the taxpayer , or to the young people who we should be trying to get back on the straight and narrow			2
‘ i want to see new models , perhaps something like secure colleges , providing education in a period of detention , rather than detention with education as an after - thought			0
‘ i want young people to get the education and skills they need to turn their backs on crime for good			2
’ the idea of axing @entity59 – which have housed notorious inmates such as @entity61 and @entity62 over the years – is likely to prove controversial			0
several @entity63 , which are often run by private firms , are coming to the end of their contracts with the @entity68			0
this allows them to be closed down and replaced with the ‘ secure colleges ’			0
private firms , charities and schools will be invited to consider running them , under a @entity73 published today			0
up to £ 200,000 a year is spent per year on a young offender - more than five times the cost of a place at @entity16 it follows the successful policy of allowing parents , charities and other organisations to open free schools			1
@entity16 recently joined the group behind a new state - funded @entity85 free school , near @entity87			0
the school ’s 500 pupils will include 225 boarders , costing parents £ 9,000 - 12,000 a year , while daytime education will be free			1
@entity93 , head of crime and justice at @entity96 , said : ‘ academies are currently transforming some of the toughest schools in the country			2
schools such as @entity16 , pictured , will be invited to consider running new secure colleges under a @entity73 published today ' so it seems like a good idea to apply the principles of those reforms – greater flexibility , a focus on improving pupil discipline and encouraging new providers into the state system – to the education of young offenders			1
’ but @entity113 , chief executive of the @entity114 , said : ‘ we should never send children to prison to get an education			0
' almost all the children who end up in custody could be dealt with in the community and that is the way to get them back into school , college or training			0
