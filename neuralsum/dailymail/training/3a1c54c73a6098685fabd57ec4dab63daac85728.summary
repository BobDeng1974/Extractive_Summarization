speaker of the house @entity64 parried a @entity16 - passed temporary budget bill that would n't defund the @entity18 law , and is now angling for a one - year pause in the law 's implementation instead as a halfway measure as much of the federal government grinds to a halt , president @entity37 is telling the @entity75 military he 'll push @entity21 to re-open the government as soon as possible			1
in his sole response early tuesday to @entity21 ' failure to avert the first shutdown in nearly two decades , @entity37 addressed his comments in a video to @entity75 troops , rather than the lawmakers he 's been scolding for weeks			1
there was no reference in the three - minute video message to @entity30 , whose insistence that @entity37 's health care law be scaled back has been at the center of a grueling back - and - forth between the @entity30 - controlled @entity5 and the @entity40 - led @entity16			2

addressing the troops : president @entity37 released a video directed towards the members of the military , explaining that they will still be working and earning their paychecks but their civilian counterparts will be furloughed but thousands of civilians who work for the @entity116 face furloughs , compounding the damage already inflicted on the military by automatic spending cuts			1

‘ you and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we 're seeing in @entity21			0
’ hundreds of thousands of government workers will be off the job tuesday after a short work period to wind down operations , but some essential services , including border patrols , air traffic controllers and @entity53 benefits , will continue			1
meanwhile , it was unclear how long the shutdown would last or how @entity21 would find a way to agree on restoring funding			0
as the shutdown approached hours earlier with @entity21 gridlocked , @entity37 called @entity30 and @entity40 congressional leaders , but there was no breakthrough in the budget impasse			1
@entity37 said a ‘ shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people , right away , ’ with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and veterans ' centers , national parks , most of the space agency and other government operations shuttered			1
putting pen to paper : this is the memo that implemented the shutdown at midnight on monday he blamed @entity12 , whom he accused of seeking to tie government funding to ideological demands , ‘ all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their party			2

senate majority leader @entity212 blamed @entity5 republicans monday for the brinksmanship that has pushed the @entity75 toward a federal government shutdown			1
