top police officers were accused yesterday of suffering ‘ collective amnesia ’ about their failure to investigate the hacking of @entity4 ’s phone			1
the @entity7 police force was severely criticised over the actions of senior detectives investigating the schoolgirl ’s murder			2
an independent watchdog found there was knowledge of the hacking ‘ at all levels ’ of the team investigating the case			2
@entity7 's deputy chief constable @entity19 ( left ) was today disciplined for failing to ' assess material sent to him ' about the hacking of @entity4 's phone , but a misconduct case was dropped tributes : @entity19 ( left ) stands with @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity27 's parents , who said because her voicemail messages disappeared they believed she was alive - in fact her her phone had been hacked its head , @entity19 , even received documents mentioning it but nothing was done for almost a decade , when the phone - hacking scandal exploded			1
the @entity37 told @entity38 that it had accessed @entity27 ’s mobile phone messages within weeks of her disappearance in march 2002			1
a former @entity7 police officer has been arrested in connection with the investigation into alleged payments to public officials			2
the 41 - year - old man was arrested at 6am this morning at his home in @entity49 on suspicion of misconduct in a public office , @entity46 said			1
the former officer , who is being interviewed at a @entity49 police station , was arrested by officers from @entity56 - @entity46 ’s investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials			1
the arrest is the 62nd under @entity56 , which is being supervised by the @entity61 and is running in conjunction with @entity63 , @entity46 ’s inquiry into phone - hacking			1
he is due to appear at @entity67 ’ @entity68 on may 8			0
but there was no investigation at the time			0
it was only after the @entity73 launched @entity63 nine years later that @entity27 ’s parents were told her phone had been hacked			2
the scandal exploded into the public consciousness with the inaccurate claim in the @entity80 newspaper that the @entity37 had also deliberately deleted messages on @entity27 ’s phone , giving her parents false hope that she may still have been alive			0
the backlash sparked the @entity86 and calls for a new system of press regulation			0
however , it was later established that the messages had almost certainly been deleted automatically by the phone company			0
questions have been repeatedly raised over why police did not act in 2002 , something which could have stemmed phone hacking in its infancy			2
their silence was seen by a tiny minority of journalists as a tacit admission that phone hacking was not illegal			2
yesterday , the @entity61 said current and former senior officers were unable to explain why nothing was done over the hacking 11 years ago			1
@entity106 , of the @entity61 , said ‘ phone hacking was a crime and this should have been acted upon ’			1
she suggested that if @entity38 had investigated the sunday newspaper ’s actions , it may have stopped phone hacking in its tracks			1
tragic : @entity27 was a schoolgirl from @entity112 , shown here ironing in video released by her her family , whose murder shocked @entity116 2002 – march 21 : @entity4 , pictured left , disappears near @entity112 railway station while walking home from school			2

police do not attempt to prosecute			0
2007 – january 26 : @entity37 royal editor @entity126 and private investigator @entity127 are jailed after admitting intercepting voicemail messages			0
2011 – january : @entity46 opens @entity63 into claims that the phones of hundreds of celebrities were hacked			1

july 4 : the @entity80 reports that the @entity37 hacked @entity27 ’s phone and – inaccurately – that messages were deleted , giving her parents ‘ false hope ’ that she was alive			0
july 10 : the @entity37 is shut down			0
december 12 : a @entity73 lawyer tells the @entity86 it is ‘ unlikely ’ that journalists erased messages from @entity27 ’s phone			2
2012 – may 9 : the @entity86 is told that the truth about how @entity27 ’s phone messages were deleted may never emerge , and it probably happened automatically			0
2013 – april 24 : a highly critical @entity61 report reveals that ‘ all levels ’ of @entity38 had knowledge of the 2002 phone hacking but did nothing			1
instead , the illicit practice continued until it was exposed in 2011 , sparking a national scandal , the closure of the @entity37 and the @entity86 into media standards			0
animal : @entity134 abducted and murdered the 13 - year - old after she walked past his home mrs @entity106 added : ‘ we have not been able to uncover any evidence , in documentation or witness statements , of why and by whom that decision was made			0
‘ former senior officers , in particular , appear to have been afflicted by a form of collective amnesia in relation to the events of 2002			1
‘ this is perhaps not surprising , given the events of 2011 and the public outcry that the hacking of @entity4 ’s phone produced			2
‘ however , it is scarcely credible that no one connected to the @entity4 investigation recognised the relevance and importance of the information @entity38 held in 2002			1
’ former nightclub doorman @entity134 was convicted of murdering @entity27 and sentenced to a whole life tariff in june 2011			0
several weeks later the phone - hacking scandal broke			0
in the ensuing furore , @entity38 set up an inquiry to look into claims officers were aware that the @entity37 intercepted her voicemail			1
it soon emerged that journalists had volunteered information about their illegal actions but police did not investigate			0
yesterday , the @entity61 said that in 2002 the force ’s focus was finding the missing girl but noted claims of an ‘ unhealthy relationship ’ with the media			1
officials said they could not find evidence to disprove mr @entity19 ’s claim that he did not know and did not make the ‘ relevant connections ’			2
probe : deputy chief constable @entity19 , left , and temporary detective superintendent @entity202 , right , have been given warnings by their force @entity63 : probe into phone hacking			1
set up in january 2011 it has 96 officers working on it and has cost £ 11.2million so far			1
@entity56 : probe into corrupt payments to officials			0
@entity211 has 70 police investigating and has cost £ 5million			1
@entity213 : probe into computer hacking			1
set up in june 2011 , @entity213 has cost £ 1.3million and has 19 officers on its staff			1
total arrests across all three : 109 the officer , now @entity7 ’s deputy chief constable , will receive ‘ words of advice ’ – the lowest possible sanction			0
he is understood to be preparing to retire next year on a pension of up to £ 80,000 a year , depending on the size of any lump sum he chooses to receive			0
mr @entity19 was succeeded as senior investigating officer on the murder inquiry by @entity202 , now a detective superintendent			1
she , too , will not face any discipline charge , but will also receive words of advice			0
@entity7 chief constable @entity234 said she had apologised personally to the @entity25 family for the failings of her force			0
she said : ‘ at the time @entity38 became aware of phone hacking , the focus of the investigation team was on finding @entity4 and then bringing her killer to justice			1
it was right that @entity27 was the primary focus of the investigation but the matter of phone hacking should have been revisited at a later stage			0

@entity61 finds @entity38 had known of crime in 2002 but did nothing
former senior officers ' appear to have been afflicted by collective amnesia '
@entity19 and @entity202 have misconduct cases dropped
but @entity38 still take ' management action ' against the serving officers
70 journalists arrested as part of the three @entity46 hacking inquiries
total cost of operations @entity211 , @entity63 and @entity213 is £ *17.5million* so far
