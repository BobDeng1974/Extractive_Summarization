by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:43 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 04:06 est , 27 june 2012 emergency treatment : health secretary @entity3 has drafted in a crisis team to deal with problems at @entity6 another 20 debt - laden @entity9 trusts could be put under special measures , it emerged today , after a crisis team took control of three @entity15 hospitals			1
a squad of doctors , accountants and administrators was parachuted into @entity20 on the orders of health secretary @entity3 after racking up debts of £ 1million a week			1
it was the first time in @entity9 history that a trust has been forced hand over its administration powers to the @entity28 after failing to meet prescribed standards			1
but today it emerged that the crisis could run far deeper than just one trust as it emerged there are 20 more that have been identified as ' clinically and financially unsustainable '			1
they have been set goals by the @entity28 to perform better but ultimately , if they do not achieve the results , they could also face being put in special measures			1
while all are in dire financial straights , many have also been told to clean up a string of performance issues which range from some of the longest waiting times in the country to alarmingly high death rates among patients			0
they include @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and @entity53 , whose hospital in @entity55 had historic debts of more than £ 40 million and became the first to be taken over in february by a private firm			1
@entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 are also under the spotlight			0
they were among seven trusts handed a £ 1.5 million bailout to ease their debts earlier this year			2
if any do find themselves in the place of beleaguered @entity72 , the cost to the government could run to many billions of pounds			2
it had gone £ 150million into the red over the past three years , largely because of crippling @entity83 deals agreed by the last @entity85 government			1
@entity86 @entity87 @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 @entity88 @entity89 @entity90 @entity49 and @entity50 @entity91 @entity51 and @entity52 @entity92 @entity93 @entity94 @entity95 and @entity96 @entity97 @entity98 and @entity99 @entity100 @entity101 @entity102 and @entity103 @entity104 @entity105 the financial chaos has already hit patient care at the hospitals – @entity109 ’s in @entity110 , @entity111 in @entity112 and the @entity113 in @entity114			0
while services have improved in recent months , patients still face some of the longest waits for operations in the country			0
one in six patients waited longer than the 18 - week government target – the worst figure for any @entity9 trust in @entity15			0
it also performs poorly on casualty unit waiting times , ranking 20th out of 23 trusts in the capital			0
some departments and wards face closure			2
the @entity6 took on a large debt when it was formed - mainly from the @entity83 that had been used for building at the princess royal and @entity111 hospitals			2
mr @entity3 has activated an ‘ unsustainable providers regime ’ , putting the trust under the control of a special administrator with powers to demand rapid changes			1
the health secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of £ 30 - £ 75million a year for the next five years			1
in his letter to the trust , he wrote : ‘ @entity20 faces deep and longstanding challenges , some of which are not of its own making			1
' nonetheless , there must be a point when these problems , however they have arisen , are tackled ' i appreciate that any decision to use these powers will be unsettling for staff , but i want to stress that the powers are being considered now so that patients in @entity15 have hospital services that have a sustainable future			0
this will benefit patients and bring more certainty to staff , the public and other local stakeholders			0
' i am determined to improve healthcare services for patients in @entity15 and will take whatever difficult steps are necessary to achieve this			0
' a @entity28 source said mr @entity3 was not prepared to run the risk of a repeat of the @entity176 scandal in which poor quality care and mismanagement led to the needless deaths of hundreds of patients			1
@entity181 , chairman of the @entity182 , told @entity184 's today programme that there was clearly a need for change in the face of such enormous losses			0
@entity190 , @entity110 : a squad of doctors , accountants and administrators was parachuted into @entity20 after running up debts of £ 1million a week he said there was an ' over-dependence on hospitals ' and that one focus of the restructuring may be improving ' care in the community '			1
the move means that , unlike loss - making companies in the private sector , the @entity6 will not have to pay back the money it has lost			0
mr @entity181 added : ' politicians are responsible but the secretary of state ca n't make all the decisions			0
there is a need for change			0
' an administrator could now be brought in and the @entity6 could go bust , leading to it being dissolved and some services closed			2
@entity217 , @entity112 : @entity20 's three hospitals will cost £ 2.5billion under the long - term construction and management scheme the @entity28 said in a statement : ' the hospitals in this @entity6 have faced multiple problems for many years , which the previous @entity224 made worse by a merger , and the approval of two huge @entity83 deals that have further destabilised the @entity6			1
the trust lost over £ 1 million a week last year , enough to pay for 1000 cataract operations per week , 200 hip replacements per week , or pay the salaries of 1200 nurses			2
' the unsustainable providers regime was created by @entity85 ’s @entity234 when he was health secretary			1
however , @entity85 never made use of them , preferring instead to sweep the problems facing some parts of the @entity9 under the carpet			2
@entity113 , @entity114 : one in six patients waited longer than the 18 - week @entity224 target - the worst figure for any @entity9 trust in @entity15 ' @entity20 is an exceptional case , showing most of the problems which are characteristic of “ challenged ” @entity245			1
there are about two dozen sucg trusts where the government inherited serious longstanding problems			0
' @entity3 ’s decision will send a strong signal to unsustainable @entity9 organisations that they can not continue to provide poor services or rely on bailouts from other parts of the @entity9			0
' all the hospitals deemed to be unsustainable have signed agreements with the @entity28 to turn their performance around , and it is possible that the government will consider putting some of them or others who can not deliver sustainable services into special measures if their leadership does not make progress fast enough			1
' @entity20 has previously owned up to multiple challenges including not being efficient enough , delivering low quality services , having poor contracting arrangements and having a weak board			2
like the many other hospitals yet to become part of the elite @entity272 , the @entity6 faces problems which – according to the @entity275 - " have lain unresolved for a number of years "			2
' @entity277 , chief executive of health think tank the @entity279 , warned on @entity184 's today programme that not only other @entity245 , but potentially even @entity272 at the very top , could go through the same thing			0
he said it was important to face up to the problems , and that administrators would be able to restructure .			0

@entity28 has identified the 20 as ' clinically and financially unsustainable '
@entity20 has gone £ 150million in the red over the past three years
many of the debts run up thanks to @entity83 deals agreed by @entity85 that will cost £ 2.5billion in the long term
departments and wards set to be closed in restructuring
trust is first to be put into special measures and faces being dissolved
