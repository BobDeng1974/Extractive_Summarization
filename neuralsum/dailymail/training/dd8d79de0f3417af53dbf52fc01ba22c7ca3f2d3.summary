by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 05:03 est , 11 july 2012 it was hardly billed as a round - the - world cruise on the @entity4			2
for one group of willing adventurers , their expedition instead involved sailing through the rough seas of the @entity12 amid tons of debris from the @entity15			1
@entity16 and his 11 companions have spent the last month documenting the rubbish making its way towards @entity20 to determine its effects on marine life and help track its transit since the disaster			1
while heavy items sank , at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys , oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500 - mile journey to @entity20			2
mr @entity16 , whose non-profit group the @entity54 has been working to reduce plastics polluting the oceans , and his team sailed 4,000 miles across the @entity12 before making it into @entity30 this week			1
' while we were doing this , we were very much aware of the tragedy , ' @entity16 told @entity62			2
' we are in the middle of nowhere and we are seeing one piece of trash every three and a half minutes			2
' all sorts at sea : the crew 's biggest find was this fishing boat , which was originally about 16ft long before it broke in half what a mess : a diver gets to grips with some of the @entity12 garbage			1
the team have been trying to analyse the effects of tsunami pollution on marine life doing his head in : some of the trash found during the month - long ' cruise ' across the @entity12 their biggest find was half a fishing boat , which @entity16 believes was originally about 16 feet long			1
around 50 or 60 fish were found living inside			2
' what 's now a wreck of a boat has become a floating reef system for this crowd , ' @entity16 wrote in his blog chronicling the journey			0
mr @entity16 , who has spent 12 years studying plastic trash in the world 's oceans , says the @entity12 is ' one giant garbage patch '			1
he will be relaying his data back to a marine research institute , which will analyse the garbage as part of its mapping of the tsunami debris			1
last month , the biggest item to wash up on @entity106 shores - a 70ft - long @entity29 dock - was found on a beach in @entity109			0
trash talk : the dock washed up on @entity111 in @entity109 last month after floating for nearly 15 months across the @entity12 from @entity29 devastation : the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck @entity29 in march last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris , including boats , cars and part of houses and factories into the @entity12 on fast tides : the latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris , shown here in a graphic interpretation of a @entity127 satellite image , from the @entity29 tsunami will hit @entity20 shores far sooner than expected the @entity130 said the @entity29 consulate in @entity132 , @entity109 , traced the seven - feet - tall concrete and steel floating dock washed up on the beach to a manufacturer in @entity29			1
the dock carried a metal placard naming the manufacturer as @entity139 , which builds docks and floating marine structures and is dated june 2008			1
the latest computer models estimate that thousands of tonnes of the debris , which now stretches 4,000 nautical miles across the @entity12 , will start washing up this october and continue to do so into late 2013			1
projections made earlier this year by the @entity144 ( @entity144 ) , in @entity145 , @entity30 , suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between march 2013 and march 2014			0
but predictions from the @entity29 government and the @entity149 ( @entity149 ) has now pushed that date forward to october this year , according to a report in @entity152			0
indeed , many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last november			0
@entity106 coastal states , already suffering from severe budget cuts in the wake of the financial crisis , are having their finances strained further by the need to fund the clean - up of their beaches , which could cost up to $ 200million			0
bizarre find : this @entity165 was found on a remote beach on the west coast of @entity168 last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year poignant : items from the disaster have also been recovered in @entity172 , like this sandal debris : toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the @entity12 earlier this year , a @entity29 teenager who lost his home in last year 's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote @entity172 beach 3,500 miles from @entity29			1
@entity185 , 16 , came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by @entity20 radar technician @entity187 on @entity189			0
mr @entity187 , who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing , now plans to travel with his wife @entity192 to return the ball			0
and in may , the @entity29 owner of a @entity165 motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the @entity198 of @entity168 last week was a miracle			0
the owner , @entity201 , a 29 - year - old resident of the town of @entity203 , in @entity204 , was tracked down by a @entity165 representative in @entity29 who saw the story , first reported by @entity207 , the broadcaster reported today			0
@entity208 , was combing the beach on @entity211 islands when he made the discovery			0
