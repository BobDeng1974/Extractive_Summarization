by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 23 october 2012 it is hailed as the future of mobile phones – but the superfast 4g service will cost at least £ 5 a month extra , despite evidence the network is cheaper to run			0
users will also have to fork out hundreds of pounds for a smartphone that can use the system , such as @entity11 ’s @entity10 or @entity13 ’s @entity12			1
@entity15 ’s first 4g network is being launched by @entity16 in @entity17 and nine other cities next week			2
superfast : users will have to spend hundreds of pounds on a smartphone such as the @entity10 ( left ) and @entity13 's @entity12 ( right ) if they want access to the @entity24 network the @entity24 system allows smartphones , tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than the current 3g network			1
but the technology is so powerful that it burns through smartphone battery life , meaning handsets need to be recharged more often			0
@entity16 customers who upgrade to @entity24 packages will pay anything from £ 36 to £ 56 a month based on the amount of data downloads they sign up for			1
this is some £ 5 a month more than they would have paid under their existing deals for a similar package			0
on top of that , customers must buy a new handset – which could cost anything from £ 110 to £ 270 extra , depending on their monthly subscription and subsidy available under their contract			0
the 4g technology makes it possible to squeeze more data into a smaller slice of the airwaves , which makes it cheaper to transmit vast amounts of information compared with @entity31			2

spokesman @entity69 said : ‘ there is a small premium that customers will pay for using a superfast network , one that is five times faster than @entity31			1
in all other markets around the world , consumers are paying a premium to access @entity24			1
‘ we think what is effectively a £ 5 premium is incredibly competitive			0
’ @entity16 effectively has a monopoly over the @entity52 until its rivals can launch services in the second half of next year			0
@entity16 justified the higher cost by saying it is investing huge sums in setting up the @entity86			1
