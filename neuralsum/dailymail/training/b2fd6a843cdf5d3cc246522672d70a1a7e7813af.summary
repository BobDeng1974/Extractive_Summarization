the bird flu - hit farm where 6,000 ducks have been culled waited almost a week to sound the alarm - after staff first thought the animals were spooked by @entity6			1
egg production dropped at the @entity9 breeding site in @entity10 , @entity11 , on november 8 , but a vet only sounded a formal bird flu alert with the government on november 14 , last friday			1
the firm said staff first thought the noise of fireworks might have stressed the birds into laying fewer eggs			0
then a vet suspected a bacterial infection , but antibiotics did n't work			0
delay : the @entity11 farm where 6,000 ducks were culled yesterday ( above ) in a bird flu outbreak only sounded a formal alarm six days after the first problems were spotted , operator @entity9 has confirmed hosed down : ducks are disinfected at the farm today			1
three days before the first signs of the virus , a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm			1
they are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away only three days before the first problem was seen , a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm			1
they are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away amid fears they may have to be destroyed			2
a drop in egg numbers is one of the six key warning signs for spotting bird flu listed by the @entity50 ( @entity50 )			1
but @entity9 , which breeds 7million ducks a year for ready meals sold in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 at 33 sites across @entity58 , said many factors could have been responsible a @entity9 spokesman told @entity61 : ‘ on november 8 - 9 the farm first noticed problems and notified a consultant [ private ] vet , who was in touch with the @entity66 ( @entity66 )			1
‘ there was no suspicion of bird flu originally , party because it was around bonfire weekend and there were fireworks			2
@entity75 operation : workers wore protective clothing as they disposed of 6,000 carcasses from the stricken farm a @entity9 spokesman defended the delay , telling @entity61 : ' it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away , like a person feeling ill and going to the gp ' ' these are one of the external factors which cause stress in animals and egg production to drop			1
‘ so it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away , much like a person feeling ill and going to the gp			0
’ the private vet first contacted the @entity66 on november 11 , but both parties agreed it was probably a bacterial infection and prescribed the ducks with antibiotics the same day			0
when ducks continued to die and the antibiotics did n’t work , the vet reported a suspected bird flu case on november 14 , the spokesman added			1
tests then confirmed the disease the next day and a public warning went out a day after that			0
in a statement , the firm added : ' there are well - established robust processes in place and they were closely followed			0
' there was no suspicion of bird flu initially as a fall in egg production can be a symptom of several different things			1
these include general stresses , such as disturbance due to such things as fireworks which were a feature of that weekend			0
' @entity50 confirmed yesterday the virus was the same @entity129 strain found in @entity130 and the @entity131			1
a leading health expert claimed there will ' probably be human cases ' of the strain - despite it never infecting a human before			2
@entity138 from the @entity139 warned the virus was ' unpredictable ' as all 6,000 white @entity142 ducks on the farm were gassed to death and dumped in metal containers			1
dr @entity138 ( left ) said although the risk of human infection was low , ' flu viruses are unpredictable ' red signs were placed around the small @entity11 village as environment secretary @entity152 told @entity153 : ' whilst we 're never complacent about such an important issue , we do have a very strong track record ' wednesday , november 5 shipment of 15,000 eggs leaves @entity9 farm in @entity10 , @entity11 , for incubators near @entity160 , @entity161			1
saturday / sunday november 8 - 9 egg laying begins dropping at @entity10 farm			0
at first staff suspect ducks have been ' spooked ' by loud noises on @entity167 weekend			0
tuesday , november 11 vet contacts @entity66 ( @entity66 ) ; both agree it is probably a bacterial infection and prescribe antibiotics			0
friday , november 14 with deaths continuing , vet sounds first bird flu alarm with @entity66			1
tests taken the same day			0
saturday , november 15 tests confirm the virus is bird flu of type @entity179			2
later tests rule out lethal @entity183 strain			0
sunday , november 16 public alert declared late at night after emergency meeting involving the chief vet			0
tuesday , november 18 6,000 ducks culled as @entity50 confirms virus is same @entity129 strain found in @entity130 and the @entity131			1
she said there could be ' a few sporadic cases ' , adding : ' we believe any time that humans are in close contact with poultry , there 's a possibility of transmission to humans '			2
although the possibility of seeing human cases was low , she said : ' i do n't see why we would n't			0
if it 's really circulating widely , there 's no reason we should n't see human cases			0
' it was the first time an expert had claimed the @entity129 strain could pass to humans			1
other top scientists , including @entity58 's chief vet and @entity214 , have stressed repeatedly that the risk of transfer to humans is negligible			1
yesterday a second site owned by @entity9 was drawn into bird flu fears for the first time			1
the firm 's @entity220 near @entity160 , @entity161 , incubating between 14,000 and 15,000 duck eggs which left the stricken farm on november 5 and are due to hatch in two weeks			2
@entity50 is now set to test the eggs and work out whether they need to be destroyed			2
a spokesman said : ' as part of our robust action in response to the confirmed case of avian flu , we are considering a range of measures including destroying a shipment of eggs sent to a separate farm for hatching earlier in november			2
' this is in line with our tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks			0
' @entity9 admitted the move but insisted : ' as the @entity139 , the minister , the @entity242 , @entity214 and others have made clear , there is absolutely no risk to humans and people should continue to eat all forms of poultry			1
' any eggs that are destroyed are done so to protect the integrity of the supply chain and ensure that the disease does not affect more birds			0
' dr @entity256 , head of avian viral immunology at @entity258 for animal health , said : ' it 's certainly possible that eggs from an infected flock could carry influenza on their surface			0
' final moments : ducks are packed into crates and taken to be culled today at a bird flu - hit @entity11 farm operation : the farm is run by @entity161 firm @entity9 , whose products from the 7million ducks it breeds in @entity58 every year include frozen duck meals for supermarket shelves such as the one above he added : ' in chickens you would know very fast because they die			1
with highly pathogenic bird flu , which this is , the can die within a couple of days , so you know very fast that you have a problem in the flock			2
' however , with some water fowl such as ducks , the symptoms of influenza can be much less severe , so farmers have to be on a very sharp lookout			0
' but he added : ' there 's all evidence to suggest this farm picked it up extremely quickly ... [ and ] i 'm quite sure the scientists from @entity50 have this question in hand			2
' a @entity50 spokesman said : ' the advice from the chief medical officer and @entity214 remains that the risk to public health is very low			0
the @entity242 have said there is no food safety risk for consumers			0

bird flu alarm was not sounded at @entity11 farm for almost a week
issues began just three days after 15,000 eggs were sent 50 miles away
operator @entity9 insisted egg loss can be a sign of many things
but it is also one of the six danger signs of bird flu listed by @entity50
6,000 ducks culled after @entity129 strain became @entity58 's first case in six years
@entity139 scientist claimed it could pass to humans for the first time
