she 's a household name , having hosted several tv shows , edited the @entity2 , and launched her own wellness website ' balance by @entity5 ' ... and now @entity5 has added another accolade to add to her merit - she 's releasing a cook book of favourite recipes that she has compiled over the years			1
this week @entity5 has released ' @entity10 with @entity11 ' in collaboration with the @entity2 , featuring over 40 recipes as well as some of her cherished food memories and personal photos			1
the 53 - year - old media personality shared her favourite recipes from the book with @entity20			1
scroll down for recipes cooking credit : media personality @entity5 has added ' cookbook author ' to her accolades despite having a health and wellbeing website , @entity5 has chosen not to buy into the ' diet / health cookbook ' trend and is bringing back wholesome cooking and real food recipes that make her happy - salt and carbs inclusive			1
' i 've always had a love affair with food , i love cooking food , shopping for it and while it 's always been a challenge since my modelling days to both enjoy food but still fit into the clothes i like , i think if you set yourself up for a too strict routine you ’ll fall off the wagon at some point , ' says @entity5			1
' there ’s enough health books out there , i 'm not about to do one , ' she said			1
' while it ’s good to have your diet cookbooks and no sugar , these recipes are about the things that make me happy			1
' and if @entity5 's confession that ' a gin and tonic and salty chips ' after a day on the golf course is one of the things that makes her happy , the cook book is sure to appeal			1
confessed carb lover : @entity5 bucks ' health trend ' in favour of wholesome food - salt and carbs included crisp comfort : the ' @entity72 ' as featured in ' @entity73 with @entity11 ' ingredients method 1			1
place the egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls			2
half fill a deep - fryer or large saucepan with oil and heat to @entity83 ( the oil is hot enough when a cube of bread dropped in the oil turns golden in 30 seconds )			2
dip each ravioli in egg , then toss in the breadcrumbs , to coat			2
working in batches of five , fry the ravioli for 1 – 2 minutes or until golden and crisp			2
remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel			2
meanwhile , heat the pasta sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until hot			2
season to taste and stir in chopped basil ; transfer to a heatproof serving bowl			2
arrange the ravioli on a platter , sprinkle with the extra parsley or basil and serve with the sauce for dipping			2
note : if you prefer not to use a cheese filling , any ravioli works just as well			2
time : 25 minutes serves : 4 - 6 this dish makes you look like a star without really trying			2
i like to quickly cook these after everyone has arrived , so the cheese is still warm and gooey			2
just ask your guests to pass the platter			0
while she is an advocate of juicing , @entity5 also believes overall diet trends just do n't work			1
' i ’ve tried just about everything but as a general rule of thumb i do n't think fad diets are sustainable , you need a balance			0
so while i do n’t like things too deep fried or have a sweet tooth , i will take salt and carbohydrates any day , that ’s my weakness			0
' not to say @entity5 is n't a advocate of good health though			1
in 2011 she was diagnosed with skin cancer ( only two years after her brother had lost the battle to liver cancer ) and spent weeks thereafter in hospital with a face full of stitches			0
this scare put her life in perspective and now other than a glass or two of wine in the evening , health is her number one priority			1
@entity5 is now an ambassador for the @entity150 , the founder of balance by @entity5 - a community website for women 40 + that focuses on sharing health and wellbeing information , and as mentioned , is an avid golfer who regularly spends time on the course			1
she also confesses that while known for religiously slip , slop , slapping , in an ironic twist of fate , her doctor recently told her she 's now lacking in vitamin d and calcium			0
sexy soufflé : @entity5 says her banana soufflé is the ultimate date night dessert and is sure to impress and in @entity5 's good humoured nature , she is taking it in her stride and using the news to her foodie advantage			1
' when she told me i was highly deficient in both vitamin d and calcium i said - " so basically i get to play out in the sun and eat cheese ? " and she said yes , and i laughed and told her i loved her ! ' in her new cook book , you can expect both ' naughty things ' ' and ' really good things '			1
@entity184 in a large saucepan of boiling well - salted water until just tender ; drain , cover to keep warm			0
@entity188 oil in the same saucepan over medium heat			0

@entity195 gently for 1 - 2 minutes or until softened but not browned			0
return the hot pasta to the saucepan with the butter and fetta			0
toss together and season to taste			0
note : remove the seeds from the chillies for a milder flavour			0
cooking time : 20 minutes serves : 4 trust me when i say , that once you ’ve had this , you ’ll be back for more			0
there ’s something really refreshing about the crunch of the raw zucchini and the zesty lemon			0
' you wo n’t find it heavy in the dessert section or deep fried , or too many ingredients or eight hours of preparation , ' she said			0
' there is an amazing chocolate panettone in there			0
i 'd only have that maybe once a year , so not often but i had to include it ! ' another favourite is the ' @entity228 ' which she says is not only delicious but a regular on her entertaining menu because it 's easy and means ' you ’re not strapped to the kitchen while everyone else is having fun			1
' day on the green : an avid golfer , @entity5 loves nothing more than a gin and hot chips after a day on the course and at 53 , life is only getting better for @entity5			1
she has a second cook book in the works focusing on her love of entertaining and she 's more invested than ever in inspiring and supporting women via her website balance by @entity5			1
' turning 50 i wanted to be the best version of myself and it really is just getting better			0
originally i was excited to turn 40 but i love what i ’m doing now			0
i ’m invested in this business - i want to help and connect with women and i also want to inspire people to get in the kitchen , ' says @entity5 ' afterall , there ’s no time like the present and i ’ve never felt more empowered			1
