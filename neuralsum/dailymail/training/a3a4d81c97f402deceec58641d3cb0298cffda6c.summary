by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 23 january 2013 bad teacher : re teacher @entity2 told students to ' p * * * off ' as an re teacher it was her job to enlighten pupils about christian values and the beliefs of other religions			1
instead , @entity2 encouraged her class to have lots of sex and ‘ sleep around ’ before marriage			1
in expletive - ridden lessons , she told pupils to ‘ stop bloody talking ’ , ‘ sit on your a * * * ’ and warned them : ‘ if you do n’t want to learn @entity19 , you can p * * * off ’			1
an investigation into her behaviour also found she posted offensive comments on her @entity25 page			0
following a parents evening she wrote : ‘ that was the most f * * * * * * horrendous evening of my life ’ , and branded parents ‘ retarded ’			1
yesterday @entity30 , 27 , was banned from the classroom for five years after @entity32 decided she was a disgrace to the profession			1
describing her conduct as unacceptable , the @entity35 declared it fell seriously short of that expected of a teacher and added that a disciplinary panel had struggled to identify any ‘ understanding , insight or remorse ’			2
@entity30 taught @entity19 at @entity44 near @entity45 , having joined the state - run secondary as a newly - qualified teacher in 2008			1
the @entity50 graduate initially showed promise , and was feted by pupils on a ‘ rate my teacher ’ website			1
however , she got into trouble after her @entity25 comments of september 2010 came to light , a report by a @entity58 panel found			0
these included : ‘ f * * * * * * retarded parents ’ followed by : ‘ that ’s because only eejits pick re ’			1
further complaints followed in january and march 2011 , the panel said			0
@entity30 made numerous references to ‘ sex from a personal perspective ’ and told one pupil ‘ not to get married because then you ca n’t sleep around ’ and that ‘ you should have sex all the time ’			1
in one lesson , she recounted a visit to @entity78 in which she saw a sex show involving a horse and a woman and revealed she had been for a naked massage			2

she also showed pupils the tattoos on her lower back and her thigh and played them ‘ inappropriate videos ’			2
inappropriate : @entity2 told her re students at @entity44 in @entity45 to sleep around and not get married one pupil claimed @entity30 did so when she ‘ could n’t be bothered teaching ’ and others said she was hindering their progress			1
one said : ‘ i do n’t feel i am taught anything			0
’ @entity30 was suspended by her headteacher in march 2011 and resigned four months later			0
recommending a ban , the panel said she had ‘ singularly failed to act as a role model to her pupils ’ and had a ‘ deep - seated attitude that can lead to harmful behaviour ’			2
mr @entity32 said the five - year ban would give her the ‘ opportunity to consider whether she wishes to teach again ’			0
@entity30 could not be contacted last night but her mother , @entity114 , said at her home in @entity116 , @entity117 : ‘ @entity118 is no longer a teacher			0
she has to earn a living as she has a little girl to care for now			0
‘ she will be devastated by this report which is very one - sided			0
there is no mention of what led up to these allegations and i think this has been a witch - hunt			0
i do n’t know if she will want me to say any more			0

@entity2 told pupils ' p * * * off ' and regularly brought up her sex life
she said not to get married ' because then you ca *n't* sleep around ’
