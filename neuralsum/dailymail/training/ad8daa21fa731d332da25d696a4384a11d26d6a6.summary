@entity1 's flagship immigration policy to force firms to take on @entity4 apprentices unravelled within hours today , as it emerged the jobs will be open to anyone from within the @entity7			1
to much fanfare @entity8 unveiled the plan to compel large firms who bring in skilled foreign workers to also ' train up someone who is a local worker '			2
despite efforts to woo business leaders to back @entity1 's reforms , industry groups lined up to slam the ' apprentice tax ' which they warned would create a raft of ' daft ' new red - tape at a time when firms were struggling to stay afloat			1
top team : labour leader @entity8 ( right ) chats with shadow chancellor @entity25 and shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity26 backstage , during the first day of @entity1 's annual party conference in @entity29 mr @entity8 said he wanted to reduce low - skill immigration and insisted the party was committed to introducing an immigration bill in its first year of office			0
he said @entity1 would force firms to train a @entity4 apprentice for every @entity37 overseas worker they bring to the @entity4 to help create a ' high wage economy ' and ease the cost of living ' crisis '			1
' any firm that wants to bring in a foreign worker from outside the @entity7 will also have to train up someone who is a localworker , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity44			1
but it emerged that under @entity7 law it is illegal to block other @entity48 from apply for jobs , including apprenticeships , in the @entity4			1
with youth unemployment running at 50 per cent in @entity54 and millions out of work across the continent , a two - year placement with high - skilled @entity4 employers would be an attractive prospect for many from overseas			1
@entity60 skills minister @entity59 said : ' i have been advised by @entity63 lawyers that legislating to require hiring @entity4 apprentices would be contrary to @entity7 law			1
' @entity60 education secretary @entity65 said : ' this policy was meant to be the centrepiece of @entity8 's conference - and it 's turned into a shambles			0
' if he ca n't get this right - how can he ever be trusted to run the country ? ' labour sources stressed that the vast majority of apprentices in @entity4 are @entity4 , with most taking up posts near to where they live			2
pledge : shadow business secretary @entity76 said firms should hire @entity4 apprenticeships as well as foreign workers under the @entity1 plan all firms with more than 50 employees will have to train an apprentice for every worker they hire from outside the @entity7			1
it is claimed it could create up to 125,000 apprenticeships over five years			2
@entity89 business secretary @entity76 said it was proof @entity1 have learnt from their mistakes on immigration			2
a new @entity94 poll shows only 19 per cent of voters think @entity1 has the right policies on asylum and immigration			0
mr @entity76 admitted that while in government @entity1 were sometimes worried that dealing with immigration involved issues of race			0
he said it was important that companies train @entity4 people in the skills firms need			1
mr @entity76 added : ‘ i think we acknowledge that we did n't get everything right in government in respect of immigration			0
‘ to start with we were too afraid of talking about it because sometimes people were worried that that involved issues of race			0
‘ but i do n't think it is racist to worry about how immigration impacts on our economy and the opportunities for our young people and what you 've seen today is the @entity1 showing that we 've listened , we 've learned from some of our mistakes and we 're determined to ensure that we 've got an economy that works for working families			0
’ but the policy has raised fears of a short - term skills back if firms are discouraged from taking on high - skilled foreign workers			2
@entity131 , director general of the @entity132 , said : ' this is an " apprentice tax " on employers and job creation			1
' it serves neither to control immigration , where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit , nor young people , who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means			0
' @entity143 , director general of the @entity144 , said : ' several of @entity1 's proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business			0
' compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every non @entity7 employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium sized businesses just as they are starting to grow			1
' pressure : @entity8 announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside @entity48 should be forced to take on an equal number of ¿ local ¿ apprentices mr @entity8 arrived in @entity29 with the party 's poll lead dwindling and internal critics warning he has failed to set out a clear strategy for the 2015 general election			0
a total of 38 per cent of voters say the @entity60 have the right policies on the economy , almost double the 20 per cent who back @entity1			0
mr @entity8 ’s party has also been rocked by the reopening of old wounds with the publication of disgraced @entity178 spin doctor @entity177 's insider account of vicious party in - fighting .			0

all companies with more than 50 staff would be hit by new rule
a @entity4 trainee must be taken on for every worker from outside the @entity7
fears it could create a skills shortage if companies stop hiring
business leaders slam ' apprentice tax ' which fails to understand industry
