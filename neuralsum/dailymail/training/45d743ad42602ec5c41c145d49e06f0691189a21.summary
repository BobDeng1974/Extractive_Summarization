by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 23 august 2012 astronomers have revealed a pair of galaxies just like our own			0
it is the first time an ' exact match ' of the @entity8 , our own galaxy , has been found in our local universe			1
the discovery was made using the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , a project that brings together data from six telescopes to build a 3d map of galaxies in our local universe			1
this image shows one of the two ¿ exact matches ¿ to the @entity8 system found in the survey			1
the larger galaxy , denoted @entity25 , which is similar to the @entity8 clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image			2
the research was presented today at the @entity31 @entity30 in @entity32 unveiled the rare sight			0
the team released an image showing one of the two ‘ exact matches ’ to the @entity8 system found in the survey			1
the larger galaxy , denoted @entity25 , which is similar to the @entity8 clearly has two large companions off to the bottom left of the image ( above )			2
in the image bluer colours indicate hotter , younger , stars like many of those that are found in our galaxy			0
the @entity8 is a fairly typical galaxy on its own , the team said , but when paired with its close neighbours - the @entity50 - it is very rare , and could have been one of a kind			2
astronomer dr @entity53 , jointly from the @entity55 node of the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) and the @entity58 in @entity59 , searched for groups of galaxies similar to ours in the most detailed map of the local @entity64 yet , the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			0
' we ’ve never found another galaxy system like the @entity8 before , which is not surprising considering how hard they are to spot , ' said dr @entity53			2
it ’s only recently become possible to do the type of analysis that lets us find similar groups			0
the @entity8 : scientists have now discovered two galaxies in our universe they say are ' exact matches ' ' everything had to come together at once : we needed telescopes good enough to detect not just galaxies but their faint companions , we needed to look at large sections of the sky , and most of all we needed to make sure no galaxies were missed in the survey ” sophisticated simulations of how galaxies form do n’t produce many examples similar to the @entity8 and its surrounds , predicting them to be quite a rare occurrence			1
astronomers have n’t been able to tell just how rare until now , with the discovery of not just one but two exact matches amongst the hundreds of thousands of galaxies surveyed			0
' we found about 3 % of galaxies similar to the @entity8 have companion galaxies like the @entity50 , which is very rare indeed			1
' in total we found 14 galaxy systems that are similar to ours , with two of those being an almost exact match , ' says dr @entity53			1
the @entity8 is locked in a complex cosmic dance with its close companions the large and @entity104 , which are clearly visible in the @entity106 night sky			0
many galaxies have smaller galaxies in orbit around them , but few have two that are as large as the @entity50			0
dr @entity53 ’s work also found that although companions like the @entity50 are rare , when they are found they ’re usually near a galaxy very like the @entity8 , meaning we ’re in just the right place at the right time to have such a great view in our night sky			1
' the galaxy we live in is perfectly typical , but the nearby @entity122 are a rare , and possibly short - lived , occurrence			0
' we should enjoy them whilst we can , they 'll only be around for a few billion more years , ' said dr @entity53			0
dr @entity53 and colleagues have been awarded further time on telescopes in @entity129 and @entity130 to study these @entity8 twin systems now that they ’ve been found .			1

unique find is first time galaxy systems identical to the @entity8 have been found in our local universe
team found 14 galaxy systems that are similar to ours , with two of those being an almost exact match
researchers now hope to find out more about how the galaxies *evolved*
