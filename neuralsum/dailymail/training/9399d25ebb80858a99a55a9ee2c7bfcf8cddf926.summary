by @entity0 hundreds of hip fractures could be prevented every year by adding magnesium to tap water , according to a newly published study			1
scientists at the @entity6 have found drinking water with a higher concentration of magnesium helps with hip fractures , a common injury suffered by the ageing population of @entity13			2
public health experts in @entity15 , where drinking water varies in quality widely , found that in areas where tap water contained magnesium both men and women suffered less hip fractures			1
previous successes in adding different naturally occurring materials include the addition of fluoride to drinking water , which led to better dental hygiene across the country however , the study did n't find a link between calcium in drinking water and the number of hip fractures suffered even though calcium is often associated with bone strength			1
the researchers have said water companies should add the mineral dolomite to public supplies , because it is rich in magnesium			1
the study , which took place in @entity15 , seems to point to a link between increased intake of magnesium and hip bone strength it is the first time the link between calcium / magnesium and hip fractures has been looked at this way			1
co-author of the study dr @entity55 said : ' the protective effect of magnesium was unsurprising but the correlation between calcium and magnesium in water and hip fracture was complex and somewhat unexpected			2
' therefore more research is needed to get a more reliable result of the relationship between drinking water and hip fractures and to get a better picture of the biological mechanism in the body			0
' hip fractures are a major public health problem across western countries			0
we already know many factors that could affect the development disease , such as smoking , height and weight , physical activity and diet , and the amount of vitamin d intake			0
@entity15 researchers created a register of all hip fractures in @entity15 and a map showing the coverage of the various water utility companies in @entity15			1
this made it possible to determine which water utility company is most likely to supply each area in @entity15			0
the researchers compiled data from three sources ; an earlier project on drinking water in @entity15 , the @entity98 with inhabitants in @entity15 from 1994 until 2000 , and the register of hip fractures in @entity15			2
these data sources were linked together to create a compilation of fractures in areas with the highest and lowest areas of calcium and magnesium			0
the researchers followed approximately 700,000 men and women over seven years and registered about 5,500 hip fractures among men and 13,600 hip fractures for women in this period .			0

@entity15 study has found link between bone strength and magnesium
study is the first time that a link has been drawn between the two factors
researchers *suggest* putting magnesium - rich dolomite in tap water
