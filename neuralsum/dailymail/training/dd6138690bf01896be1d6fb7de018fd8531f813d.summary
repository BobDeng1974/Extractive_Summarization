shocking : @entity3 mother @entity11 was jeered out of a movie theater because her autistic son @entity15 , pictured , was annoying patrons , one of whom called the young man ' retarded ' @entity30 said in the blog that their problems started when @entity15 , who often gets frightened at the beginning of movies , shrieked ' i want to go home , ' during the first preview and said it again once the film started			1
' we had n't even gotten past the previews			0
i know most of us , as families of children with disabilities , have all these plans in mind , but we could n't even get there , ' she later told the @entity49			0
that 's when the crowd turned on them			0
' are you going to make him be quiet ? ' one woman said , according to @entity30 's blog			1
when she was informed that @entity15 had autism , the woman hit back , ' i know he is , but why should the rest of us have to suffer ? ' her husband then allegedly chimed in with , ' if you do n't make him be quiet i 'm calling the manager			2
' moved : @entity64 , right , is holding a movie event especially for special needs kids after being moved by the blog @entity11 , left , wrote and things got worse from there , with ' ugly ' remarks coming from all directions			1
when the mother finally decided enough was enough and got up to leave , she claims the theater erupted into applause and patrons shouted ' do n't come back ' and ' he 's retarded ' as the family made their way to the door			2
but before she left , she felt compelled to speak to the jeering group , she said in her blog			0
' there is a lesson here			0
a lesson that is so much more important than anything you will learn from this movie , ' she said she told them			0
