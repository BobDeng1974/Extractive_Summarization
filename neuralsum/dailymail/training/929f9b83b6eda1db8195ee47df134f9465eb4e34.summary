by @entity0 thousands of miles of @entity2 farmland could be turned into ' bee motorways ' in a bid to boost the declining number of pollinating insects in the country			1
the scheme would see farmers and land owners volunteering their fields toward a 3,000 - mile corridor of plush grassland filled with wildflowers which encourage bees and other insects to migrate			1
others may receive a grant or bursary for allowing use of their estates			0
breeding ground : patches of grassland , such as the in @entity26 reserve , above , are perfect for pollintors to thrive in			0
the plan is to encourage migration across the country rather than having certain insects confined to separate patches of the country , as is the case with some species now			1
it is hoped that the ' bee lines ' would also help butterflies , moths and hover flies to spread their wings and breed across @entity2			1
the scheme , which has been strongly backed by the @entity43 , is the brainchild of wildlife charity @entity45			0
they have already begun recruiting landowners in @entity48 , where it is estimated that 60,000 acres are needed for pollinating beasts to thrive			0
the project comes at a time when the honey bee population of the @entity2 is in steep decline			1
it is believed that there are only half the number of nectar producing insects pollinating in the country now , compared to population figures of 25 years ago			2
and the decline in bees and other species is not just a worry for insect lovers			2
migration : if the plan is successful , it could see not only the honey bee , left , but also butterflies , right , and other pollinating species more widespread in @entity2 according to farming experts , around 90 per cent of food and crops in our country are thought to be depend on pollinators			1
currently in around 60 per cent of the insects who help plants reproduce are in decline			1
the causes of this drastic reduction has been put down to factors such as toxic pesticides , habitat loss , disease and intensive agriculture which has meant there is now less wild grassland in which the insects can breed			2
@entity93 , chief executive of @entity45 , who has already presented plans to the @entity95 , said losing our insects could mean losing a major part of our source			0
support : climate change secretary @entity101 , above , is said to be a fan of the bee motorway scheme having previously voiced concerns about the decline in pollinator numbers speaking to @entity107 , he said : ' if we lose a lot of our pollinator species , we lose a lot of the options for feeding ourselves			2
the mroe we lose the less likely we are to be able to feed ourselves in an efficient way			0
' climate change secretary @entity101 is said to be behind the initiative , while @entity116 , a leading @entity43 has also lent her backing			0
the environment spokeswoman in the @entity119 said : ' the government is putting together a comprehensive strategy for all pollinators , but until we have that , it is important that projects like this are supported			0

large *stretches* of grassland could help insects migrate
farmers will be asked to volunteer their land to the project
60 per cent of @entity2 *'s* pollinating species are on the decline
