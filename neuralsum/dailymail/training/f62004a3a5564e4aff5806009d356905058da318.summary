by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:40 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:52 est , 27 december 2013 @entity3 is one of the first stops for tourists visiting @entity7 , but in the not - so - distant future out - of - towners will need flash if they want to take pictures of the @entity11			1
once a series of seven super-slim luxury high - rises are built , the southern quarter of the park will be largely covered in shadows according to a new study conducted by the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
every december 21 , on the winter solstice , the park will hit its darkest point , with shadows extending 20 blocks into the park - reaching the @entity23			0
a blanket of darkness : when seven luxury high - rise buildings are completed , the southern quarter of @entity3 will be obscured by shadows a look into the future : a new report by the @entity31 shows how seven new skyscrapers will impact light in the park			1
the above rendering shows what shadows will be case on the equinox ' it will basically plunge the park into a solar eclipse in the middle of the day , ' @entity39 , chair of the @entity40 , told @entity45			2
@entity46 , the large field where @entity7 spend nice days soaking in the sun , will be obscured and useless for tanning every equinox			2
while @entity3 was created as a public place for rich and poor to enjoy , the buildings in question are being marketed at @entity54 oligarchs and @entity56 tycoons who want apartments with @entity3 views ( skyscraper museum director @entity59 calls these views the ' money shot ' )			1
worst case scenario : on the shortest day of the year , shadows in the park will be as long as 20 blocks - reaching the @entity66 and @entity67 seeing the shadow : on the equinox , the new skyscrapers will cast shadows to reach a dozen blocks into the park the under - construction @entity74 is one of the buildings in this so - called ' @entity77 ' and two of its penthouses sold for a reported $ 90million each			1
while outgoing mayor @entity82 has argued that it 's in the city 's interest to attract wealthy foreigners to live here , most of them buy up @entity7 apartments as second - homes , and therefore avoid having to pay the city 's income tax			0
another problem is that most of these buildings are being constructed ' as of right ' meaning they do n't need to undergo an environmental assessment or public review			0
the new @entity7 : the buildings in orange are the current developments planned for the ' billionaire 's belt ' south of the park shooting up : @entity103 is pictured in this foreground view of @entity3 with the new future buildings in orange and these buildings will be some of the tallest in the @entity108			1
the @entity109 will be 1,424 feet tall , which is higher than the top floor of 1 @entity111 and the proposed 1,350 foot 111 west 57th street building will be higher than the @entity114 's observation deck			0
these buildings are able to reach such heights because they 've bought up the air rights from their surrounding buildings			0
before and after : a view of 57th street now and what it will look like with the addition of the skyscrapers in development casting shadows : the graphic above shows how large a shadow the 1,000 - foot - tall building at 217 west 57th street will create only for the wealthiest : @entity74 is expected to be one of the tallest high - rise apartments in the world			2
two of their penthouses recently sold for $ 90million each advances in skyscraper engineering mean these buildings can be constructed super slim - about two townhouses wide in some cases - occupying plots of land originally suited for 40 - story buildings			0
in their report , the @entity18 proposes a re-appraisal of zoning codes to ensure that there 's more oversight and public involvement in making this new breed of skyscrapers			1
' it 's troubling that the sky 's the limit when it comes to one of our most precious public spaces , ' @entity18 president @entity151 told the @entity159			2
' we need to protect these spaces			0
' tunnel vision : 57th street itself will be significantly darkened with these new constructions pushing the boundaries : the buildings under development will be some of the tallest in the @entity108 - not to mention the @entity7 skyline the new breed of skyscraper : innovation in skyscraper engineering means these new buildings can be super-slim and occupy lots that are just two townhouses wide in some cases			0

a new report *released* by the @entity18 shows how the lower quarter of @entity3 will be obscured with the construction of seven new skyscrapers
