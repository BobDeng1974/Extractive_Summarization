i did the same as everybody else			2
i was a lad ; we partied a bit , but i did n’t hide anything			1
it ’s just that nobody bothered to look in the right place			2
‘ you have to remember that doing kids tv then , you were expected to be the son of @entity21 , and that was very difficult			1
‘ now you can be much more open , and have a proper life			2
but then , it was almost , “ oh , you ’ve got a girlfriend			2
what type of girl is she ? ” but my mates and i very quickly realised : do n’t go in to central @entity47 and have a wild time			1
‘ by the way , when i say partying , my weakness has always been booze			1
i never got much into drugs , because i was n’t very good at it			1
‘ we were simply getting leathered in @entity55 where we lived at the time			2
everybody knew us and nobody was bothered , and nobody would tell			2
so i got away with it			2

‘ but , like everyone else , i have opinions , and i do have a temper			0
‘ there ’s nothing that winds me up more on @entity92 than people who are stupid , and who say the most ridiculous things			0
and you have to be very diplomatic			0
‘ you have stopped me in the past and said , “ do n’t swear because all you ’re going to do is play their game , ” but what i do is follow them , and send them a direct message saying something that @entity2 would never say ! and then i unfollow them , watch their outrage and block them			0
‘ i have another secret @entity92 account			0
