@entity0 put in a gutsy performance but were ultimately seen off by @entity3 winners @entity4 in @entity5 on sunday night			1
@entity6 equalised @entity8 's first half opener but the @entity10 hitman restored the host 's lead minutes later with what proved to be the winner			1
@entity0 gave @entity4 plenty of problems in the second half but the world champions stood strong and they could have added a third with @entity8 hitting the post late on to deny him a hat - trick			1
here , @entity22 gives his verdict on the performance of the players			2
celebrate : @entity6 looks delighted with his goal but @entity0 's joy was shortlived in @entity5 @entity4 @entity28 : was thankful for @entity29 blocking @entity31 ’s early strike then untroubled by @entity33 ’s shot on stroke of half - time			1
not a prayer as the @entity38 man motored through to equalise			2
@entity39 : in for @entity42 at right - back , the @entity41 man justified his inclusion with a gem of a cross that allowed @entity8 to head high beyond @entity47			1
had the measure of @entity31 whenever the @entity49 broke forward			2
@entity50 : bayern colossus had harder task to shackle @entity53 than he probably imagined			2
left for dead as @entity33 raced onto @entity55 ’s pass to score			0
justified : @entity39 came in at right back and marshalled @entity33 well in the first half @entity29 : outstanding sliding block by the @entity59 man steered @entity31 ’s onto the bar			0
gladly strode into central midfield to release @entity62 or @entity63			1
@entity64 : @entity5 full - back had been savaged by @entity66 last week but this was a night for expression on the front foot			1
@entity8 ought to have converted his peach of a cross while @entity47 did well to hold his fierce strike			1
@entity73 : holding role beside @entity75 but frankly it was n’t much of a two - man job			1
was able to get further forward to help @entity78 as @entity4 attempted to dissect the @entity49 ’ defence			1
@entity62 : @entity81 ’s £ 25m man had @entity82 for company and the @entity84 ensured his opponent was n’t allowed to dictate the pace of the game at will			0
headed occasional scares off at the pass with wonderful recovery tackles			0
recovery : @entity62 dictated the play and would not let @entity0 take a grip in midfield @entity8 : preferred to @entity96 , the @entity10 man missed a pinch of a header inside eight minutes			1
made up for that 10 minutes later with a looping header to beat @entity47 then poached the winner			0
8 @entity101 : local hero was deployed off the front in the most fluid of formations			0
twice tested @entity47 from distance in the first half and miserly use of the ball contributed to the outcome			0
7 @entity112 : @entity114 winger was asked to go at @entity115 down the left			0
had reasonable success but found the @entity119 man reserves his best stuff for his country			0
6 contrast : @entity112 strugged to get past @entity115 but @entity8 was at his best @entity123 : hero of the @entity126 final started at the point of the four - man attack but it was clear @entity130 had given him licence to do as he pleased			1
nippy , incisive runs and instant control of whatever was fired at him made him a thorn in the @entity49 ’ sides			0
7 @entity139 @entity140 for @entity112 ( 84 ) @entity141 for @entity78 ( 90 )			0
late sub : @entity143 's @entity140 came off the bench for the final six minutes in @entity5 subs not used @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity96			1
booked : @entity29 , @entity8 @entity0 : @entity150 : justified his starting place over @entity152 with some superb saves in both halves			1
@entity115 : a trademark surging run so nearly earned @entity53 an equaliser at the start of the second half			2
@entity161 : in at left - back after @entity164 ’s injury and did fine in trying circumstances			2
close run thing : @entity161 marshalls @entity8 away from goal - he did n't score ... this time @entity168 : passed a pre-match fitness test , but could n’t maintain his record of three straight clean sheets			1
@entity172 : blocked a certain second goal from @entity112 but toiled to deal with @entity8			1
@entity174 : played in a deep lying midfield role sweeping up but needs time			2
getting to grips : @entity174 needs time and he was n't gifted that by the relentless @entity179 @entity180 : finished the night with a red after two late bookings			0
smashed superb shot offside upright early in game			0
@entity82 : lively and inventive , trying to bridge the gap between @entity53 and midfield			2
@entity31 : had @entity0 ’s first effort of the match with a shot deflected over the bar			1
struggle : @entity31 could n't make use of his creative talents and was often pushed back @entity6 : another outstanding night for the little winger , scoring a quite brilliant breakaway goal for the equaliser			1
@entity53 : so nearly drew the @entity49 level at the start of the second half			0
ran tirelessly before making way for @entity200			0
@entity139 @entity55 for @entity31 ( 58 )			0
@entity176 for @entity174 ( 58 )			0
making an impact : @entity176 saw an effort on goal blocked as he looked to impress from the bench subs not used @entity152 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity200 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212			2
booked : @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity82			0
referee : @entity216 ( @entity217 )			0

@entity6 scored a brilliant equaliser in this @entity221 *qualifier*
but @entity8 's two - goal haul won it for the @entity3 winners
there were plenty of good performances from @entity0 's ranks
but @entity4 stood strong in defence and *dominated* in midfield
