' he 's not a ragamuffin , ' said manager @entity42			2
' he 's polite and he 's well mannered but he 's a hungry boy and he just loves playing his football			0
' a @entity45 fan , @entity7 still tries to sneak across to @entity46 with his father @entity47 to ogle the skills of @entity49 and @entity50 , who play in his favoured position ' at the top of a diamond or in the hole '			1
the 19 - year - old accurately lobs the ball over former @entity2 keeper @entity58 to score against @entity19 what type of player is he ? @entity7 looks slight - standing at just 5ft 7in - but is built like a light - welterweight boxer and can pack a punch			1
