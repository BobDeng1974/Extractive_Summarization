by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:06 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 21 december 2012 former chief whip has lost confidence in the head of the @entity5 in the growing row over the investigation into his stand - off with @entity10 officers @entity11 is under growing pressure about why he failed to publicly challenge the police over the plebgate affair when doubts about the police 's account emerged three months ago			1
@entity10 identified inconsistencies between claims chief whip @entity20 called police ' f * * * * * * plebs ' in a row in september , but was reluctant to question @entity25 's account			1
the prime minister held talks with mr @entity20 this week amid a growing row about why @entity29 did not do more to challenge police claims against the former chief whip			1
today mr @entity11 admitted there is ' a lot of sympathy ' for his former chief whip			1
mr @entity20 resigned from government a month after ranting at police officers who told him he could not ride his bike through the gates of @entity10			1
he admits swearing but denies calling officers ' f * * * * * * plebs '			2
a member of the diplomatic protection group has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office after reportedly sending an email to his local mp , @entity50 deputy chief whip @entity49 , posing as a member of the public and accusing mr @entity20 of calling police plebs ’			1
the contents of the email was very similar to the police log , including claims that a crowd of tourists which appears to be contradicted by @entity61 footage of the incident senior @entity10 figures , including cabinet secretary sir @entity64 , reviewed @entity61 footage of the incident in september and found it contradicted some of the claims against mr @entity20			1
but the doubts were not forcefully made public , and mr @entity20 was forced to quit after losing the confidence of the @entity50 mps he was in charge of			1
' the prime minister clearly decided not to raise concerns with [ the metropolitan police commissioner ] @entity74 , ' a friend of mr @entity20 told the @entity76			1
' it is bloody astonishing			2
the approach was to leave this swinging in the wind rather than raise questions with the police			0
' it also emerged today that mr @entity20 has challenged the independence of the head of @entity25			1
mr @entity20 has let it be known he has ‘ no confidence ’ in met police commissioner @entity74 , who is still backing the disputed police log of the altercation			1
but today both @entity93 mayor @entity92 and @entity10 insisted they had full confidence in mr @entity74			1
the mayor of @entity93 's spokesman said : ' the mayor has absolute confidence in the commissioner			2
he has assured the mayor that he is determined to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible			0
the mayor has every confidence in that assurance			2
' and a @entity10 spokesman said : ' the prime minister has full confidence in the @entity99 and believes the police should be allowed to carry out the investigation , which is being overseen by the @entity109			1
' mr @entity11 said he held a meeting with the former minister in @entity10 on monday , ahead of the revelations in the @entity114 documentary the following night , which shed heavy doubts on the allegations made by the police			1
mr @entity11 , speaking as he left @entity119 on his @entity121 visit to the troops said of the feelings towards him among mps : ‘ i think there ’s a lot of sympathy for @entity20			1
‘ because the revelation about the email on its own has shocked a lot of people , and some people will have been influenced by that			0
it ’s quite a shocking development			0
’ during the meeting mr @entity20 was ‘ very calm and rational but feels obviously disturbed by what seems to have happened ’ , mr @entity11 said			1
‘ he and is very keen to get to the bottom of it			0
his mood was calm and reasonable given what are pretty extraordinary revelations			0
@entity11 , on a visit to @entity119 , held out the possibility of mr @entity20 returning to government @entity93 mayor @entity92 warned ' this has got to be sorted out ' because the public had to have confidence in the police			1
' it 's not just serious because it affected the career of a @entity50 cabinet minister , or whatever - it 's serious because everybody in @entity93 has a right to expect the police to be fair and scrupulous in their testimony about what may or may not have happened , he told @entity159			2
the @entity160 , which represents rank and file officers , also admitted mistakes in stoking the row which saw officers posing for cameras wearing ' @entity168 and proud ' t - shirts			1
it comes at the end of a week of extraordinary twists in the saga of what was and was not said during the brief row on september 19			2
yesterday it emerged that a second man , aged 23 , had been arrested and held overnight on suspicion of ' intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an indictable offence '			0
around 30 officers are working on the inquiry , which is being supervised by the @entity109 ( @entity109 )			0
met police commissioner @entity74 , pictured today , is under pressure over his handling of the investigation , with @entity93 mayor @entity92 warning everyone expects the police to be ' fair and scrupulous ' the prime minister said he stood by mr @entity20 because of doubts about the evidence against him			1
‘ we knew this email was unreliable so it did not influence my judgment as to whether @entity20 should stay in government , ’ he added			1
mr @entity11 said that when mr @entity49 confronted the individual who allegedly wrote the email , he " flatly denied " being a police officer			0
the @entity186 also gave his strongest hint yet that mr @entity20 could return to government			2
speaking on a pre-christmas visit to troops in @entity119 , he was asked in interviews if mr @entity20 could make a comeback			2
‘ one step at a time			0
let 's get to the truth about what happened , ' he said			0
‘ but i think it has been an extraordinary development , frankly , to find a police officer apparently posing as a member of the public , pretending to have been outside @entity10 at the time and then trying to blacken the name of a cabinet minister			2
’ the dispute centres on discrepancies between the police accounts of the incident and the @entity61 footage			0
both the official police log and the fabricated email claimed there were tourists standing at the gates who were shocked by mr @entity20 's language , but security cameras covering the @entity10 entrance show almost no one there at the time			2
the police log , leaked to the @entity231 , said : ' there were several members of public present as is the norm opposite the pedestrian gate and as we neared it , mr @entity229 said : " best you learn your f * * * * * * place ... you do n’t run this f * * * * * * government ... you ’re f * * * * * * * plebs			0
" ' the members of public looked visibly shocked and i was somewhat taken aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior government official			0
' @entity61 from @entity10 , as shown on @entity252 , suggests there was not a group of tourists at the gates at the time of the incident the badly - spelled email sent to mr @entity49 by a police officer posing as a member of the public claimed : ' we were waiting at the main gates of @entity10 , with several other tourists			0
' it added : ' imagine to our horror when we heard mr @entity20 shout very loudly at the police officers guarding " you _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @entity270 ! ! " and " @entity271 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ country " and just continued to shout obscenities at the poor police officers			2
my nephew , as was i , totally taken aback bu his , @entity278 @entity277 ' behaviour and the gutter language he used , especially it appeared directed at the police officers			0
' now i know that the other people / tourists standing with us were also shocked and some were even inadvertently filming the incident ( it would n't surprise me that in this age it 'll be on @entity286 or other social media website )			0
' as doubts grow about the evidence against mr @entity20 , the @entity160 started rowing back from his fierce criticism of the senior conservative			1
chairman @entity292 : ' i understand those who say the @entity160 stoked up some of the media attention in relation to @entity20			1
i think we can all say we could have done things better			0
' the federation has to look at how we can get some measure of control to ensure that there is perhaps a better way of doing business in the future			0
that 's something we are going to have to review in the new year			0
' but he insisted he was personally ' taken aback and shocked ' by mr @entity20 's reported comments , which came immediately after the murder of two woman police officers in @entity311			2
he told @entity312 : ' i am going to wait to see what happens in relation to the investigation			0
' if he has been done a calumny in relation to what happened , i will be one of the first in the queue to apologise			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
