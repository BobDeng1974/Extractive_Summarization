by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:20 pm on 22nd december 2011 the @entity2 have insisted today that there is no need for @entity6 women with @entity8 breast implants to have them removed			1
it comes a day after the @entity11 government announced they would foot the bill for tens of thousands of breast implant removals , amid fears they could raise the risk of cancer			1
the @entity11 - made implants , were filled with a silicone gel believed to have been made for mattresses gel rather than medical grade gel			1
@entity21 was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer two years after having breast surgery using a @entity11 - made silicone gel			1
( see box below ) yesterday the @entity11 government told 30,000 affected women to have the implants to have them taken out			1
but a similar number of @entity6 women who also have the controversial implants face hefty surgical bills for the same treatment			1
however , a @entity2 spokesman , played down health fears , saying : ' the @entity35 had discussions today with other health or regulatory experts from @entity11 , the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
' they all agreed that there was no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with @entity8 breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates			1
this is in line with @entity6 findings			1
' it follows advice from the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) that said women with an concerns should make an appointment with their implanting surgeon and have a full discussion			1
but the advice has led to accusations that @entity6 women , including breast cancer survivors , are being left in limbo			1
lawyers acting for hundreds of women who are suing @entity6 clinics over health concerns linked to the breast implants , said the medical regulator needed to take action			1
@entity79 , a partner at @entity81 solicitors , which is representing more than 250 women , said some of his clients had complained of inflammation , fatigue and fibromyalgia , a musculoskeletal pain disorder			2
mr @entity79 added : ' the recent reports have , of course , been very worrying to our clients , many of whom have already suffered terrible problems as a result of their implants			2
' i have written again to the @entity35 to urge them to react to the developments in @entity11 and , similarly to @entity11 , to set up a suitable protocol for women affected in this country			2
' i do not believe that @entity35 's reaction to date has been satisfactory ; it is unbelievable that the @entity35 have not ensured that they were involved with the consultations in @entity11 about a product that affects such a large amount of women in this country			2
' up to 50,000 women in this country have the @entity113 , or @entity114 , which were among the cheapest on the market and widely used in cosmetic clinics both here and abroad			2
@entity118 , director of @entity119 , said the breast implant industry should be more heavily regulated			0
appearing on @entity121 , she said : ' i think what we need to have as a good lesson from all of this , is this country needs a breast implant registry			0
' i 've been involved in setting up with the @entity2 , the national joint register , so you could monitor every hip and every knee that a patient has in this country			0
' ms @entity118 said patients should make an appointment to see their surgeon if they were worried about their implants			2
' i 'm not saying that they do n't need to worry but the advice in this country is that they do not need the implants removed , ' she added			2
' @entity143 , as i said , have done separate studies , and it 's really important that patients take note of what @entity143 said			0
' the industry has got a complaints mechanism if they want to complain to the organisation where they had the implant			0
' @entity154 , of the @entity155 , said : ' people with @entity8 implants do have a higher failure rate and there is a significant risk at some point they might rupture			2
' if this is a worry for patients , the sensible thing to do is to get them replaced earlier rather than later			0
' the @entity165 does take out damaged implants but wo n't pay for new ones to be put in , meaning patients could be left with a bill that runs into tens of thousands of pounds , as well as the trauma of additional surgery			1
fears about the safety of @entity114 surfaced 18 months ago when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands			0
an inquiry ordered by the @entity11 health watchdog reported ' serious irregularities ' in the implants			0
but when the gel 's manufacturer was asked for studies on the safety of the filler , it said it did not have any â€“ because it believed it was to be used in the manufacture of mattresses			0
it also emerged that many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body			1
tests failed to find any firm evidence the implants could trigger cancer			0
but earlier this month the death of a @entity11 woman who had breast augmentation in 2005 raised fresh concerns			0
@entity21 died from a rare form of cancer and the @entity204 said the gel could have been an ' aggravating factor '			0
threat : @entity210 quality ' implants contain industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical - grade fillers yesterday @entity11 government spokesman @entity216 said : ' it is a matter of urgency that all women who have had these @entity8 implants are identified and the implants removed			1
' ' the profession has no choice , ' said @entity224 , a leading plastic surgeon based in @entity225 , adding that the removal of the implants was a ' simple operation '			0
meanwhile , 27 @entity6 women are suing their clinics to pay for the operation and for compensation for scarring and emotional trauma			1
@entity234 , of @entity236 - based @entity235 , said those worst affected could be in line for tens of thousands of pounds			0
the firm is also trying to compile a national register containing details of all those who have the implants .			0

' low quality ' implants contain industrial silicone designed for computers and electronic devices
@entity6 lawyers say the government has left thousands of women in limbo
