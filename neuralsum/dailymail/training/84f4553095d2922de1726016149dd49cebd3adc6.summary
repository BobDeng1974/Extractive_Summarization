by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a weekend @entity4 story that questioned the government 's intelligence following last year 's terror attack in @entity8 , @entity2 has members of @entity10 crying foul			1
some believe the report 's conclusions were calculated to help @entity16 's future political fortunes			1
' i do n't know why they put it out , unless it was for political reasons , ' rep. @entity17 said during a ' @entity24 ' broadcast on monday			2
the @entity26 @entity25 said the @entity4 was ' laying the groundwork ' for a @entity29 presidential run			1
' of course , secretary @entity29 was in charge at the time , ' said @entity17 of the sept. 11 , 2012 terror attack on state department facilities			1
' i think they 're just ... trying to absolve her from the lack of security that was sent over there , the number of requests for security that was turned down			2
' the @entity4 reported that the attack on @entity1 diplomatic facilities in @entity8 was not solely the result of a pre-planned , carefully coordinated terrorist action , as @entity1 intelligence has determined in the 15 months since the military - style assault left @entity1 ambassador @entity48 and three others dead			1
instead , the report claims , an ad hoc group of @entity52 militants were largely motivated by a blasphemous video , made in the @entity1 , which circulated on @entity55 in the week preceding the attack			1
and president @entity63 , then - secretary of state @entity16 and then - @entity83 ambassador @entity82 all pushed that version of events during the short time between the @entity8 attack and the 2012 presidential election			1
but the @entity88 determined almost immediately that it was a premeditated terror attack			2
@entity29 's @entity90 sanitized the agency 's approved talking points before @entity93 went on television to denounce the video , removing references to a @entity2 terror group affiliated with @entity98			1
it was @entity29 who presided over the @entity90 at the time of the attack			2
her agency was also faulted , under her leadership , for failing to beef up security in @entity8 after several requests from @entity48			2
now poised to run for the presidency in 2016 , @entity29 aides see the @entity8 episode as a significant political obstacle			1
and @entity25 political operatives told @entity112 that the @entity4 story seemed constructed specifically to help her			1
one , a @entity25 - linked campaign adviser in the swing - state of @entity117 , said the report ' was meant to give @entity16 an escape hatch ' so she can ' cite the @entity4 every time someone claims she lied about the video			1
' ' we talk about plausible deniability all the time in political scandals , ' the operative said			2
' we '' , this smells like a recipe for political deniability			2
' in a ceremony marking the @entity1 return of the @entity8 victims ' bodies , both @entity63 and @entity29 referred to the anti-islam video , despite likely knowing the @entity88 's conclusion that an @entity98 - linked group had preplanned the attack another , an election lawyer in @entity140 who was central to president @entity142 's razor - thin victory over then - vice president @entity143 in 2000 , said that the @entity4 story would ' set the @entity8 investigation back months ' and ' give the @entity16 people something to point to , because @entity148 knows they ca n't point to the facts			1
' both asked @entity112 to withhold their names			0
' it 's election season , ' said one , ' so it 's time to start filtering what i say publicly again			0
' two @entity29 advisers failed to respond to requests for comment			0
@entity4 editorial page editor @entity160 wrote on monday that his paper was n't expressing a political preference with the story			1
' since i will have more to say about which candidate we will endorse in 2016 than any other editor at the @entity4 , let me be clear : we have not chosen mrs. @entity16			1
we have n’t chosen anyone , ' he wrote			0
@entity1 rep. @entity17 ( @entity171 ) said monday that the @entity4 was attempting to ' absolve ' @entity16 of her responsibility in the @entity8 mess in order to aid her future election hopes @entity4 reporter @entity176 , who wrote the contested story , defended his reporting on the sunday @entity180 program ' @entity181			1
' ' there 's just no chance this was an @entity98 attack , ' he said , ' if , by @entity98 , you mean the organization founded by @entity186			0
' @entity176 wrote on sunday that he determined ' @entity8 was not infiltrated by @entity98 , but nonetheless contained grave local threats to @entity1 interests			2
the attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned , but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs			0
' witnesses to the events of sept. 11 , 2012 told @entity196 on monday that the @entity4 report is 100 per cent wrong			1
@entity8 ' was a coordinated attack			2
it is completely false to say anything else			0
… it is completely a lie , ' one witness said			0
lawmakers , particularly @entity25 , agree			0
' what we do know is , it was not an accident , ' @entity205 @entity204 rep. @entity204 countered during the same broadcast			0
' these are terrorist groups , some of them linked to or self - effacing or self - claimed as @entity98 - linked			0
' @entity204 chairs that @entity214 , which has aggressively investigated the causes of the @entity8 attack and allegations that the @entity63 administration engaged in a @entity220 cover - up			1
but ' there is a group that was involved [ in @entity8 ] that claims an affiliation with @entity98 , ' @entity204 insisted			0
emotions : president @entity63 shed a tear in may as he answered tough questions about @entity8 during a rare public press conference that organization , the @entity2 - based @entity229 , has claimed partial responsibility for the mortar , rocket - propelled grenade and automatic - weapons barrages			1
@entity204 also said he knew of no evidence suggesting that the controversial @entity237 video gave rise to the attack			0
writing on sunday about the events of sept. 11 , 2012 , @entity176 reported that ' a @entity2 journalist working for the @entity4 was blocked from entering by the sentries outside , and he learned of the [ anti-islam ] film from the fighters who stopped him			1
' ' other @entity2 witnesses , too , said they received lectures from the attackers about the evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet , ' @entity176 reported			0
renewed emphasis on the now - infamous video put members of congressional intelligence committees on their heels , and forced them to defend their conclusion that @entity98 and its affiliated groups planned the attack and carried it out with ruthless precision			2
the resulting debate has been reduced to the thorny but semantic question of whether or not @entity229 is part of the @entity98 network			0
blasphemy : a 13 - minute trailer for a low - budget film portrayed the @entity270 prophet @entity269 as a gluttonous , vicious womanizer whose parents were unknown to him was it an anti-american attack or the product of religious righteousness ? the @entity4 story has reignited a debate that @entity10 thought it settled months ago ' the assertion [ in the @entity283 ] that @entity229 does not have links to @entity98 was wrong ' and contradicted by ' the intelligence , to a large volume , ' @entity280 chair @entity279 , a @entity281 @entity25 , said on ' @entity287			1
' @entity279 drew careful distinctions between the @entity290 - based ' @entity98 core , ' led by @entity291 , and its affiliates – including @entity229 – that have sprung up throughout the @entity294 world			0
' did they have differences of opinion with @entity98 core ? yes			0
do they have affiliations with @entity98 core ? definitely , ' @entity279 allowed			0
fellow @entity303 rep. @entity303 , a @entity304 who has chaired the intelligence committee in the past , declared on @entity196 that ' @entity229 is considered part of the @entity98 network , supporters of @entity98 , and they have a training camp right out near @entity8			2
so i ’ve known all along it was @entity229 , and i consider that to be an @entity98 affiliate			0
' wrong ? @entity82 , then the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity83 , appeared on five different sunday talk shows following the @entity8 attack , claiming throughout that it resulted from the video 's publication on @entity55 madame president ? former secretary of state and former first lady @entity16 is expected to run for president , and @entity25 operatives suspect the @entity4 story was a conscious effort to give her ' plausible deniability ' about the attack which happened on her watch @entity279 insisted that his committee has ' gone through some 4,000 different classified cables leading up to the event , talked to people on the ground during the event , done the postmortem on the event through the committee investigation			1
' that effort , he suggested , should trump what a news organization with more limited resources can conclude with any certainty			0
@entity205 @entity344 rep. @entity343 , who sits on @entity279 ' committee , said @entity1 intelligence included intercepted phone calls and other conversations that contradict the @entity4			1
' they did n't have the same access to people who were not aware that they were being listened to , ' said @entity343			0
' they were heavily reliant , obviously , on people that they interviewed who had a reason to provide the story that they did			0

@entity4 report claimed the @entity63 administration 's early story about @entity8 , blaming the attack on an anti-islam video , has some merit
congressmen on both sides of the aisle criticized the reporting as *inconsistent* with intelligence from @entity2 that the times did n't have
the @entity8 terror attack on @entity90 *outposts* killed a @entity1 ambassador and three other americans
then - secretary of state @entity16 pushed the story about the video and denied earlier requests for beefed - up security
now @entity25 operatives suspect that the @entity4 story was written to give her ' political deniability ' as she prepares to run for president in 2016
one @entity25 congressman said the @entity4 was ' trying to absolve her from the lack of security that was sent over there '
