footage has emerged of police in @entity2 aggressively questioning the girlfriend of a man who they had just shot dead for holding a bb gun in a @entity8 store			1
an officer from the @entity11 department repeatedly demands to know where the slain @entity12 , 22 , got his ' gun ' from in an interview with his weeping girlfriend , @entity16			1
@entity17 , who is not told until the end of the interview that her loved one has died , is clearly distressed by the line of question from the disbelieving officer , @entity23 , who repeatedly suggests she is lying			1
in fact he did n't have a gun , and picked up a replica from a shelf @entity23 , who warns @entity17 she could be jailed for what she says in the interview , also suggests that she looks ' messed up ' and could be drunk or high on drugs in footage obtained by the @entity40			1
@entity17 breaks down in tears several times in the interview following the august 5 incident , which focuses on the moments before @entity12 was shot dead after picking up a bb gun in the @entity8 outlet			1
a 911 caller had told police the replica gun was actually a real assault rifle , which led officer @entity52 to gun him down			2
a grand jury later decided not to indict him for the killing			0
@entity16 swore repeatedly on her own life , and the graves of her dead relatives , that she was being honest , despite @entity23 telling her she was phrasing her answers like ' someone not telling the truth ' , and saying he expected her testimony to change later			2
shot dead : @entity12 , pictured right with his mother , @entity64 , was killed after a 911 caller said he had a gun in the store moments before : @entity12 can be seen above moments before he is killed by officer @entity52 officer @entity23 : ' you and @entity12 went into @entity8 , at some point as i understand it , @entity12 produced a gun			1
you were with him just moments before that , were n't you ? ' @entity16 : yes , sir @entity23 : ok , tell me where he got the gun from			2
@entity17 : sir i do n't know - i honestly do n't know			2
@entity23 : and the truth is you knew at some point he did carry a gun , is n't it ? @entity17 : no sir , i did n't know			1
i swear i did n't know			0
@entity23 : you see , i 'm having trouble with this			0
@entity17 : [ through tears ] please , give me a lie detector test ! footage from 94 - minute interview , released to the news site by the @entity2 attorney general , shows @entity23 grilling @entity17 at length on her version of events , at times banging his hand on the table for emphasis			1
he also pursues a theory that @entity12 had taken his own , real , gun into the store in order to shoot his ex-girlfriend , @entity104			0
at one point he asks her : ' did he ever mention " i 'm gon na shoot that bitch " , or something like that ? ' @entity17 replied that he did n't , and that as far as she was aware she was in @entity111 and not in the store			0
although the grand jury concluded that the shooting was justified , federal officials are looking into the case			0
earlier this month it was reported that officer @entity52 , who also killed a man in 2010 , will remain on leave until after that investigation			0
