by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 18:24 est , 20 february 2013 unconscious and bleeding : @entity1 was found having sustained fatal head injuries yards from his home in @entity4 the family of a cancer surgeon who died after being punched by a 16 - year - old yob spoke last night of their shock that his killer will never face justice			1
an open verdict was recorded yesterday at an inquest into the death of @entity1 , 68 , who was found sprawled outside his £ 750,000 home with fatal head injuries			2
but @entity4 coroner @entity17 said the evidence of the teenager who claimed he punched the regular churchgoer in self - defence after being shouted at was ‘ evasive ’			2
mr @entity17 added that there was ‘ no substantial proof as to the means by which mr @entity1 met his death ’ , but it was ‘ totally out of character for mr @entity1 to show anger , let alone strike out at someone ’			1
the teenager had been charged with manslaughter but the @entity32 dropped the case last year			2
without any witnesses , lawyers said there was little prospect of a conviction			0
the @entity39 can reveal that evidence from the boy ’s headmaster , which was presented to the coroner but not made public , revealed that the boy ‘ did n’t like being challenged by authority ’			0
now aged 17 , and a student mechanic , he had only been at the school for around four months but was suspended at the time of the attack			0
yesterday mr @entity1 ’s brother @entity51 , 57 , himself a retired surgeon from @entity53 , @entity54 , said they had been left ‘ disappointed ’ by the justice system and would lodge complaints with the police and @entity32 for their handling of the case			1
‘ we were appalled , shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic circumstances of @entity1 ’s death , ’ he said			2
‘ my brother has been let down by the justice system and that boy has effectively got away scot - free			0
we are disappointed nobody will face justice			0
quiet village : the £ 750,000 house of dr @entity1 , near where he was found lying on the ground ‘ the coroner has basically said he did n’t know how @entity1 died , but we do know that if he had n’t encountered that boy on that night @entity1 would still be here today			1
the @entity32 said that because they had no witnesses to corroborate what the boy had said – my brother was dead , he was the silent witness – they had no chance of getting a conviction , but that effectively denied us justice			0
mr @entity1 , who never married , was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at @entity85 in @entity86 up until his death			1
‘ i do not object to anyone having a defence , but it is wrong that that defence has never been challenged or put to a jury			0
the @entity32 had the uncorroborated testimony of a thug against the conduct of a professional man who worked all his life caring for others			0
‘ @entity1 was a pillar of society and a devout @entity101 who lived a blameless life			1
there is no evidence that my brother ever attacked anyone			0
it is totally inconsistent with his reputation			0
' a jury should have been given the chance to decide what was the truth in court			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s sister , solicitor @entity114 , 63 , of @entity115 , added : ‘ we feel very let down			1
’ @entity118 coroner ’s court heard that the incident involving @entity1 and the teenager happened last march in the prosperous @entity4 village of @entity122 , near @entity123 , where the surgeon had been picking up litter from the grass verge next to his thatched home			1
the boy , who was riding a bmx bike and was with two friends , said he punched mr @entity131 after the surgeon began shouting at him for having no lights on his bike			2
mr @entity1 was found on the ground next to his car and died in hospital six days later			1
the boy , who can not be named for legal reasons , was arrested but the @entity32 dropped the charge of manslaughter after a pathologist ’s report supported his claim that he hit the cancer specialist in self - defence			2
@entity147 dr @entity146 told the inquest he believed the cause of death was a single blunt force head injury consistent with a heavy fall to the back of the head			0
mr @entity1 , who never married , was semi-retired but had been working as a locum at @entity85 in @entity86 up until his death			1
grieving neighbours : a touching note left with flowers by @entity1 and mrs @entity160 , who lived two doors down from dr @entity1 's house for over 50 years			1

@entity1 was found unconscious yards from his house in @entity4
had been *collecting* *rubbish* to clean up the village when he was punched
@entity171 *admitted* hitting mr @entity1 , but was cleared of manslaughter
@entity174 said there was no ' substantial ' proof as to how he died
mr @entity1 was a ' pillar of society ' say his grieving *siblings*
