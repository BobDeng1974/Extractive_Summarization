the @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 do n't exist - but they could be place names in future atlases as glaciers continue to melt			1
a @entity7 - based urban planner has created maps of cities around the world showing the alarming results of what the world would look like submerged in water			1
though the doomsday scenario in which all of the world 's glaciers melt could be thousands of years in the future , it would make many loved cities - including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 - unrecognizable			1
coastal cities around the world have been affected by global climate change , melting polar ice and warming ocean waters that have had concerning results on rising sea levels			1
more worrying , the @entity31 estimated that if all of the world 's glaciers melted , sea level would rise by more than 260 feet			1
he then puts everything into @entity55			0
the base cartography for the projects only takes him a few hours @entity36 said the most fun - and most time - consuming - part of the project is the minute detail he puts into labeling the maps with humorous and relevant place names , including @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity23 ( pictured ) depending on the city , @entity36 decides how much to rise the sea level			1
when creating his first underwater map , he put @entity7 under 240 feet of water @entity36 has created maps for eight @entity43 cities thus far and is working on several places in the @entity72 , including @entity2 and @entity73			1
no names have been added to his @entity72 maps , yet , but his @entity2 map shows what the city would look like under 130 feet of water - or if half the world 's glaciers melted @entity36 , who has a background in geography and urban planning , has created a series of maps of major @entity43 and @entity44 cities submerged in water in hopes of giving people a new look into global warming			1
though the extreme sea - level rise is n't expected in the near future , @entity36 has given names to landforms and bodies of water that could emerge if the flooding were to happen , according to @entity98			1
@entity36 uses open - source data to create his maps and puts his information together using a mapping program called @entity53			0
he then puts everything into @entity55			0
the base cartography for the projects only takes him a few hours			0
depending on the city , @entity36 decides how much to rise the sea level			2
some cities are completely submerged with a 260 - foot sea - level rise , but to make maps more interesting he lowers the amount of water			1
in his first sea - level rise map , he put @entity7 under 240 feet of water			1
but when doing @entity22 , he only did a 100ft sea - level rise			1
most cities become unique sets of small islands , inlets and landforms			0
landmarks including @entity7 's @entity121 and the @entity122 in @entity22 are washed away as the water level gets higher			2
@entity36 details the maps down to specific roads in some cities			0
the names he gives bays , islands and bodies of water often give humorous insight into cities and the places @entity36 has created , though he said this is what takes the most time			2
@entity137 turns into @entity138 as water spills over the streets and landmarks of the city			0
all that is left is a series of islands @entity36 has named @entity146 @entity36 hopes that after seeing cities , including @entity1 ( pictured ) with an extreme amount of sea - level rise , his maps capture people 's attention about global warming in a new way most cities become unique sets of small islands , inlets and landforms			1
landmarks like @entity7 's @entity121 and the @entity122 in @entity22 are washed away as the water level gets higher like @entity23 , much of @entity161 ( pictured ) is expected to be almost fully taken over by water if the world 's glaciers melt			1
the @entity165 and @entity166 both are submerged in @entity36 's map in his map of @entity22 , for example , the @entity168 and @entity169 , which have been completely submerged in water , have been renamed the @entity168 and @entity172			2
he has created maps for more inland areas , as well , including @entity175 , @entity176 , which he puts under 260 feet of water			2
the map shows @entity178 - where an annual two - weekend - long music festival is held in the spring - entirely underwater			0
@entity36 hopes that after seeing cities with an extreme amount of sea - level rise , his maps capture people 's attention about global warming in a new way			1
his interest in the maps came after reading @entity190 , by @entity191 , he told @entity98			0
' the novel is sort of a future anthropology of @entity176 's @entity195 , and in it she looks into the future and sees @entity199 flooded by sea - level rise			1
since then , i would often think about what the world around us would look like once all the ice caps melted , ' he said			0
@entity36 has created maps for eight @entity43 cities thus far and is working on several places in the @entity72 , including @entity2 and @entity73			1
no names have been added to his @entity72 maps , yet , but his @entity2 map shows what the city would look like under 130 feet of water - or if half the world 's glaciers melted			1
@entity36 eventually hopes to put together a world atlas			2
the result of @entity220 's icecaps melting would be ' catastrophic to human civilisation and @entity220 's biosphere ' , according to @entity223 , an amateur graphic designer from @entity224			0
more than 75 per cent of the world ’s population lives below 300ft above the sea level , including the vast majority of all large urban areas			2
@entity36 has created maps for more inland areas , as well , including @entity175 , @entity176 , which he puts under 260 feet of water the map of @entity175 shows @entity234 and @entity178 - where an annual two - weekend - long music festival is held in the spring - entirely underwater @entity21 morphs into a series of islands , with the area 's mountainous and high - elevation areas towering above the places flooded with water as the warming gradually progresses , scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events			1
hurricanes , typhoons and massive floods will occur more frequently and on a much more devastating scale			0
the world ’s deserts will expand , engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of @entity254 , including @entity255 , the @entity256 and entire southeast of @entity258			0
‘ although this scenario is extremely unlikely to happen within our lifetimes , the truth is , that climate is going to change sharply , ’ claims mr @entity223			0
‘ unless we limit our co2 emissions to bare minimum , @entity220 will be more than 4 ° c warmer in the year 2100 as it is now			0
‘ such a rise in temperature would be destructive to environment and human civilisation as well			0
’ scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet , but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this			0
over the past century , reports suggest the @entity220 's temperature has increased by around half a degree @entity283 and , according to the @entity43 @entity284 ( @entity284 ) , this has already caused sea levels to rise by around 7 inches ( 18cm )			2
the largest concentrations of ice on @entity220 are found in @entity288 and @entity289 but it is also found on exposed areas , on mountain tops and in other regions			0
the @entity289 ice sheet , for example , is so large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in @entity220 ’s history			0
when @entity36 first submerged @entity302 , he used 260 feet of water , but soon realized the map would be more interesting if there was less water			2
when he only rose the sea level by 130 feet , he formed @entity308			0

@entity7 - based @entity36 created maps showing what cities look like submerged in hundreds of feet of water
@entity31 estimates that if all of the world 's glaciers melted , sea level would rise by more than 260 feet
some coastal cities have already been affected by global climate change and warming ocean waters
but the extreme sea - level rise is not predicted to happen for at least *1,000* years
@entity36 gave names to islands , inlets and landmarks that cities would become when flooded with water
the place names often have humorous ties to what they used to be , such as @entity63 and @entity336
he 's created maps for @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity72 cities and hopes to make a world atlas
