solar wind and other particles from the sun could give us an early warning of space rocks heading for @entity7 , researchers have found			1
they say changes in the solar wind , plasma and other types of particle could give away the location of rocks currently missed			1
they say it could help spot smaller rocks like the 2013 @entity19 meteor impact in @entity20 , which injured 500 people and caused significant property damage			1
the solar wind is a stream of energized , charged particles , primarily electrons and protons , flowing outward from the @entity35 , through the solar system at speeds as high as 900 km / s and at a temperature of 1 million degrees ( @entity39 )			1
it is made of plasma , and the temperature of the corona is so high that the @entity35 's gravity can not hold on to it			1
the findings were presented at the 47th annual meeting of the @entity47 in @entity48			2
huge near - earth objects ( @entity50 ) that circle the sun are often trailed by smaller space rocks and ultrafine dust , and the @entity7 's gravitational pull can bring the smaller objects directly towards the planet			2
even if they are heading straight for @entity7 , ' you will never see it in a telescope , ' study co-author @entity58 , a space physicist at @entity60 , @entity57 told @entity65			0
when meteoroids randomly collide with the medium - size rocky bodies in the dust cloud around an asteroid , fine dust is created			0
photons ping the surface of the fine dust particles , knocking off electrons and leaving the dust positively charged , @entity71 said			0
as a result , the stream of particles spewing from the sun , called solar wind , interacts with the charged dust and creates a spike in the magnetic field			1
several spacecraft in the solar system have onboard magnetometers that can detect these magnetic signatures of collision			2
by using data from multiple spacecraft on the size and scale of the magnetic field perturbations , along with previously derived data on the speed and characteristics of known interstellar bodies , the team can calculate the size and shape of a trailing debris cloud			0
a meteor that blazed across southern @entity29 in february was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century			2
more than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion , estimated to be as strong as 20 @entity109 atomic bombs , as it landed near the city of @entity19			1
the fireball measuring 18 meters across , screamed into @entity7 's atmosphere at 41,600 mph			0
much of the meteor landed in a local lake called @entity115			2
other than the latest find , scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from @entity119 since the february 15 incident			0
however , only five of them turned out being real meteorites			0
the team has already found that @entity125 , which circles the sun roughly every 368 days , may have tens of thousands of small but deadly objects in its orbit that may pose a threat to @entity7			0
in contrast , @entity130 , which circles the sun every 455 days , does n't carry much rocky debris in its wake , @entity71 said			0
astronomers have identified just 1 percent of these space rocks lurking in the solar system ; the objects are usually less than tens of meters wide			1

changes in the solar wind and plasma could give away locations
could help spot rocks like the 2013 @entity19 meteor impact in @entity20
