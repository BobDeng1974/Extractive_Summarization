@entity1 's relegation from the @entity2 was confirmed at the @entity3 as the winless @entity4 suffered their 20th straight defeat of the season at the hands of the in - form @entity8			1
@entity11 's victory over @entity12 this weekend coupled with this heavy defeat for the @entity4 sees @entity1 's run in the top flight come to an end and the game 's flagship competition without a presence in the capital in 2015			1
the rampant @entity8 made it 10 wins in succession as they had far too much power and pace for @entity2 's basement dwellers , running in 13 tries			1
relegated : @entity4 were sent down from the @entity2 after a 72 - 12 defeat at in - form @entity8 , their 20th straight loss of the season rampant : @entity30 ( left ) celebrates the third of @entity8 's 13 tries with @entity33 as the @entity4 were demolished at the @entity3 winger @entity33 claimed four tries with second row forward @entity36 and prop @entity30 both scoring hat - tricks , with the other tries coming from @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 while @entity42 landed 10 goals			1
@entity1 's points came from tries by @entity46 and @entity47 , with @entity48 kicking both conversions			1
@entity8 gave a debut to teenager @entity51 in the centre while @entity40 made his comeback from a torn bicep injury on the substitutes ' bench			0
@entity1 knocked on straight from the kick - off and that set the tone for the opening exchanges as winger @entity41 and prop @entity30 were denied tries by some last gasp @entity4 defence in the opening minutes			1
but it did not take long for the @entity8 to open their account when in the seventh minute some crisp handling finished with @entity42 sending @entity33 over for the opening try			0
hat - trick hero : @entity33 scores his third try of the game as @entity8 sent out a message to their challengers and the @entity74 winger was on the mark again five minutes later when he took @entity77 's pass to score and give the @entity8 an early 8 - 0 advantage			2
but on their first foray into @entity8 territory the @entity4 posted points as they kept the ball alive superbly and stand - off @entity83 crossed for the try which @entity48 converted			1
a scuffle between @entity86 and @entity87 sparked a punch up which raised the temperature a little but the @entity8 soon got back to business with four tries in a blistering nine - minute spell			0
firstly @entity33 's kick on the last tackle bounced nicely for @entity30 to scoop up the loose ball and touch down and fine inter-passing between @entity36 and @entity96 ended with @entity36 touching down four minutes later			0
easy : @entity8 's @entity36 completed his hat - trick by running in his team 's seventh try straight from the restart a superb break by @entity103 allowed the supporting @entity36 to claim a quick - fire double and then @entity33 completed his hat - trick when he benefited from quick hands from @entity106 and @entity86 straight from a scrum			2
bridge kicked four first - half goals to give the @entity8 a commanding 32 - 6 half time lead			0
it took the @entity8 just five minutes after the restart to add to their tally as @entity36 claimed his hat trick as he touched down @entity116 's kick and @entity42 converted			0
@entity1 claimed their second try of the game on 51 minutes when @entity47 crashed over from close range and @entity122 's conversion went over off the upright			0
but normal service was soon resumed as @entity40 on his return to action took @entity103 's pass to score and stretch their lead to 42 - 12			0
in the final 20 minutes the @entity8 added a further five tries as the @entity4 tired with @entity33 scoring his fourth , @entity30 claiming two more to complete his hat trick and @entity41 and @entity39 also touching down .			2

@entity2 left without presence in the capital after heavy defeat seals @entity4 ' relegation
