by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:22 est , 23 september 2013 a 500 - year - old piece of the battle flag which flew on the field where @entity4 was slain is going up for auction			1
the red and gold cloth fragment was , auctioneers believe , a standard of the future @entity12 during the pivotal and bloody fight between the houses of @entity15 and @entity16 which took place at @entity18 in 1485			1
@entity19 say the remnant , measuring six - and - a - half inches by five - and - a - half inches , should make between £ 3,000 and £ 5,000 when they auction it this weekend			0
a piece of history : the battered fragment from the flag has survived more than five centuries @entity12 , left , defeated @entity4 , right , at the @entity18 in 1485 to become @entity4 @entity12 the firm 's @entity27 said the fragment was part of a far larger flag carried by sir @entity31 who was standard bearer to @entity12 during the fight			1
' it 's difficult to say exactly what the standard would have looked like but it probably measured at least two foot by four foot and was a large flag that was held aloft for army colleagues to see on a hill - it would have been very much a focal point for a military advancement , ' he said			2
' it is an incredible find from one of the most important battles ever fought on @entity46 soil			1
' @entity12 's forces killed @entity4 at the @entity18 , ending the @entity48 and marking the beginning of the @entity12 dynasty which ruled @entity51 until 1603			1
the @entity53 - based auctioneer said the flag fragment had been one of three decaying parts originally hung above the tomb of sir @entity31 , who was standard bearer to the then @entity12 during the battle			1
sir @entity31 , a @entity60 , was buried in @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , after he died in 1490			1
the remnant was then passed to a local family who passed it down through generations before deciding to sell it			2
the red and gold remnant of the battle standard dates back to the @entity18 in 1485 mr @entity27 said the material 's provenance was ' very good ' as it had been in the keeping of the same family in @entity77 since at least 1847 , when it had been mounted in a frame for safe - keeping			1
he said : ' our vendors are obviously aware of its social value today since the imagination of what happened at the @entity18 will keep historians debating for years to come			0
' i am just delighted such a fundamental accessory to that 1485 battle has been unearthed only months after finding @entity4 in a @entity91 car park			2
' as an auctioneer , i thrive on the social relevance such bygone artefacts had on society			0
if only this fragment could talk it could tell us so much			0
' the bloody @entity18 ended with the death of @entity4 and a decisive @entity100 victory the auctioneer told @entity102 he hoped the flag would be bought by someone in the @entity46 , preferably a museum or a collector who would put it on permanent loan in a @entity46 museum			2
international interest in @entity4 has boomed after human remains uncovered in an old friary beneath a @entity91 car park in 2012 were earlier this year confirmed by experts as being those of the late monarch - the last of the @entity16 line , who reigned from 1483 until his death in battle			2
mr @entity27 said that the current interest in the @entity16 king around the world meant that the fragment may fetch ' considerably more ' than its estimate when it is auctioned on saturday			0
the @entity18 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 and marked the end of the @entity48 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity16 and @entity15			0
standard bearer sir @entity31 was buried in @entity62 church in @entity63 with the flag the battle flag hung over the tomb of @entity12 's standard bearer sir @entity31 in an @entity63 church one of the most important clashes in @entity51 history , it saw the death of @entity4 , ushered in the @entity12 dynasty and gave @entity143 one of his best known quotations - ' a horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse '			1
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity16 king @entity4 and his challenger @entity12 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity51 from his base in @entity158 , @entity12 arrived on the coast of @entity160 on august 1 , 1485			2
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity4 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity12 's army south of @entity164 in @entity165			1
after @entity4 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity12 and became the first @entity51 monarch of the @entity12 dynasty , which lasted until 1603			1
the remains of @entity4 , who died in 1485 at the @entity18 , were discovered by archaeologists under a car park in @entity91 last september			0
since then where his remains should lie has been the subject of a fierce battle between @entity177 , the @entity178 , and a group of the king 's distant relatives			0
earlier this month the cathedral announced plans for a £ 1.3m tomb for the king , but the society branded the design ' too modern and stylised ' and said it would withdraw £ 40,000 of funding			0
unlikely grave : the warrior king 's remains were found during a dig under a car park in @entity91 last year the society 's @entity194 , who initiated the search for his remains , said the design was too contemporary and did not reflect the fact ' that there is a warrior king beneath the ground '			0
the cathedral has hit back , saying it will not change the design to secure the funding from the historical group and that it would not be ' held hostage '			0
meanwhile the @entity207 , a group of distant relatives of the long - dead king , has weighed into the argument , calling for his remains to be buried in @entity16 , where @entity4 had strong links			0
the alliance last month won a judicial review of the licence that said his remains should go to @entity91			0
' too modern and stylised ' : the @entity178 opposes @entity177 's plans for a new tomb flowers lie on the spot in @entity177 where it is planned @entity4 's remains will be entombed			2
