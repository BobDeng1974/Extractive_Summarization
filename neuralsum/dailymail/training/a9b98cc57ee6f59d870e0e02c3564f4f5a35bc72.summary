complained : @entity6 , 71 , bought the outfit ( pictured ) to wear at @entity5 when she went with her husband @entity13 in june 2012			1
but when she took it to the dry cleaners to be cleaned it came back dark grey she accused him of leaving her outfit looking like a ‘ dishcloth ’ with dark patches along the lapels and the satin tie of the jacket , a court heard			1
mr @entity15 made attempts to clean the suit again but mrs @entity6 , 68 , said the results left it ‘ slate grey ’			1
she demanded the full cost of the suit			2
mr @entity15 eventually offered her £ 400 , even though he claimed that experts who examined the garment said the ‘ slight dark grime ’ had not been caused by cleaning but possibly by humidity while being stored			2
mrs @entity6 sued and this week a judge found mr @entity15 liable			1
he awarded mrs @entity6 £ 600 compensation and £ 140 costs			1
