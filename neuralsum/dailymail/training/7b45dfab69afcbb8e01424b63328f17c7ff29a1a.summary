@entity0 will install the stations along the @entity2 from @entity3 to @entity4 , across the entire @entity5 , along the @entity6 from @entity3 to @entity7 and the @entity8 and @entity9 to @entity10 via @entity11 motorways are to become ‘ electric superhighways ’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery - powered cars			1
‘ @entity24 stations ’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year , enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time			1
billionaire entrepreneur @entity0 is fitting the devices , which can charge the @entity27 electric cars his company makes in 20 minutes , giving a range of 130 miles			1
this is far faster than most current electric cars , which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles			0
it means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across @entity36 without concerns about running out of power , known as ‘ range anxiety ’			1
the first network will stretch from @entity4 to @entity3 along the @entity2 , cover the entire @entity5 and follow the @entity6 from @entity3 to @entity7 and the @entity8 and @entity9 to @entity10 via @entity11			1
@entity27 declined to say which service stations would be used , but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the @entity44 services at the junction of the @entity5 and the @entity46 in @entity47			1
the network will also expand across much of @entity49 to enable owners to take the @entity51 and drive on the continent			1
@entity27 hopes motorists will be able to take its cars from northern @entity55 to southern @entity56 by the end of 2014			1
drivers will be able to get a range of 240 miles for 40 minutes charging or 300 miles for 75 minutes charging with a @entity61 car , which costs £ 70,000			0
drivers will be able to get a range of 240 miles for 40 minutes charging with a @entity61 car , which costs £ 70,000 ( pictured ) electric cars are becoming more popular in @entity36 , but sales have been held back by a lack of charging points motorists do not have to wait with the car while it is charging			2
@entity27 drivers will have unlimited access to the network for either a one - off fee or included in the top price of the cars			1
mr @entity0 was announced as the government ’s ‘ electric car tsar ’ in november			1
despite efforts by the government ’s @entity81 , which has £ 900million of taxpayers ’ cash to play with , electric cars have so far failed to spark much interest in the @entity36 motoring market			0
only 1,547 pure electric cars were registered in @entity36 from january to april this year , just 0.18 per cent of total car sales			2
a major drawback has been problems for motorists who are trying to find a public charging point on the street or at a supermarket and making sure they have the right cable for it			0
@entity97 , president of the @entity98 , said that @entity27 could be a ‘ game changer ’ for the top end of the market			2
he said : ‘ the car looks good and is desirable			0
if it can be partially charged in 20 minutes and has a 300 - mile range , then it should satisfy 98 per cent of drivers			0
’ @entity105 and @entity106 are also expected to develop high - speed charging networks , but cars using them are not expected to have such a long range			0
@entity0 is known as the real - life @entity110 after he was said to have inspired @entity113 ’s portrayal of the genius inventor in the superhero films			2
mr @entity0 made his fortune with the online payment system @entity118 , which he sold to @entity119 in 2002 for £ 1billion , using the proceeds to launch @entity121 , which has a £ 2billion contract with @entity123 to deliver cargo to the @entity125			0
in 2003 he set up luxury electric car company @entity27 , and last year unveiled a futuristic plan for a ‘ @entity128 ’ , a new type of transport that would send passengers in capsules along a tube at the speed of sound			1
@entity135 - born mr @entity0 has five sons by his first wife @entity137 , whom he divorced in 2010			2
he later married @entity36 actress @entity138 , star of the recent @entity140 ’s films			0
the couple divorced in 2012 but have since reunited			0
miss @entity138 , educated at top girls ’ school haberdashers ’ @entity142 ’s , once said : ‘ i fell in love with @entity146 because of our mutual love of physics			0
i ’m interested in philosophy , and talking to @entity146 i realised my questions could be answered with physics			0
