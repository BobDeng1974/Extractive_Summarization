by @entity1 medical correspondent risk : the obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in @entity5 , with the toll set to increase in the next decade the obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in @entity5 , with the toll set to increase in the next decade			1
the biggest study of its kind shows that being fat is a major risk factor for the most common cancers , triggering more than one in ten cases			2
the chances of developing some forms of the disease are up to 60 per cent higher , with the risk often rising in tandem with weight gain			1
researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall - bladder , kidney , liver , and colon cancers in the @entity5			1
if @entity5 continue to pile on the pounds , it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026			1
study leader dr @entity31 , from the @entity32 , said people had made the connection with obesity being a cause of heart disease and diabetes			2
but he said there was a worrying lack of awareness about the link with cancer , even though two out of three adults are overweight or obese			0
‘ the number of people who are overweight or obese is rapidly increasing both in the @entity5 and worldwide , ’ he said			2
‘ it is well recognised that this is likely to cause more diabetes and cardiovascular disease			0
our results show that if these trends continue , we can also expect to see substantially more cancers as a result			0
’ the study used data from @entity58 records involving more than five million @entity5 aged 16 and older who were cancer - free and had been followed for an average of seven - and - a - half years			1
the risk of developing 22 of the most common cancers was estimated according to body mass index ( @entity63 ) , a measurement relating weight to height			2
@entity63 increases the risk of developing ten of the most common cancers , says the study published in @entity70 medical journal			0
over 12,000 cases of these ten cancers each year are attributable to being overweight or obese , say researchers at the @entity32 and the @entity74			1
' the higher the @entity63 , the higher the risk ' : researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall - bladder , kidney , liver , and colon cancers in the @entity5 they calculate that if average @entity63 in the population continues to increase at the same rate – about half a stone on average over the next 12 years – there could be more than 3,790 extra cancers in 2026 as a result			1
almost 167,000 people developed one of the 22 cancers studied over the follow - up period and @entity63 was associated with 17 of the 22 examined			0
in need of treatment : if @entity5 continue to pile on the pounds , it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026 ( file picture ) a healthy or normal weight is a @entity63 score of 18.5 to 24.99 ; above that is a sliding scale to life - threatening fatness			1
carrying an extra two stones in weight over and above the ‘ healthy ’ range was clearly linked with higher risk of some cancers , and the risk went up with further weight gain			1
‘ the higher the @entity63 , the higher the risk , ’ said dr @entity31			0
the rise in cancer of the womb was 62 per cent higher , gall - bladder 31 per cent , kidney 25 per cent , cervix 10 per cent , thyroid and leukaemia 9 per cent higher			2
@entity63 also increased the risk of other cancers including liver ( 19 per cent ) , colon ( 10 per cent ) , ovarian ( 9 per cent ) , and breast cancers ( 5 per cent )			0
even within normal or ‘ healthy ’ weight ranges , higher @entity63 was associated with increased risk of some cancers			2
however , those with high @entity128 may be at a slightly reduced risk of prostate cancer and pre-menopausal breast cancer			0
dr @entity31 said : ‘ this variation tells us that @entity63 must affect cancer risk through a number of different processes , depending on the cancer type			0
‘ but the take home message is that putting on weight substantially increases your risk of many of these cancers			0
’ dr @entity144 , chairman of the @entity145 , said : ‘ we are still not getting the message across about the link between excess weight and cancer			1
trying to keep a healthy weight is important , but you can reduce your cancer risk even if you ’re obese by becoming more physically active			0

@entity5 *'s* obesity epidemic is blamed for 12,000 cancer cases every year
the chance of developing some forms of the disease is up to 60 **%** higher
excess weight could account for 41 **%** of womb cancers , experts predict
@entity164 could lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026
