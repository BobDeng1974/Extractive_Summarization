there are few more frustrating sights than a player who dazzles for his club reduced to a shadow of himself for his country on the greatest stage of all			2
it is an affliction that players and fans dread : @entity11 burnout			0
@entity13 has suffered from it , @entity12 has been plagued by it and even @entity16 has succumbed to it			0
it is no coincidence that @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 crashed and burned at @entity23 when their star men were exhausted and half - fit from their efforts over a long season			1
there are bound to be players on their knees in @entity30 this summer too			0
but who will be the stars who fail to live up to the hype they have created for themselves ? scroll down to see the distances run by @entity37 players heading to the @entity11 ... fresh : @entity39 ( centre ) was full of running against @entity41 running machine : @entity43 ( centre ) has covered more miles than any other @entity21 player this season making up ground : @entity48 's ( right ) performances this season have put him on the brink of the @entity21 starting xi @entity53 has analysed performance data - courtesy of @entity55 - from all 90 outfield @entity37 players heading to the @entity11 to work out who has expended the most energy for their clubs this season and therefore could be at risk of fatigue ahead of the summer showpiece			1
the man who has run the extra mile for his club this season may raise a few eyebrows , but not outside @entity70			0
@entity71 covered an enormous 266.8 miles of turf up and down the country during @entity75 ’s remarkable and successful survival bid			2
good news for @entity77 , but potentially bad news for the millions of @entity80 fans hoping their captain and defensive midfielder can inspire a @entity11 shock against @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
the next two players to have run the furthest for their clubs are two englishmen , @entity43 and @entity48 , who have covered 255.7 miles and 236.7 miles respectively			1
both played in the warm - up win over @entity92 at @entity93 last friday night , where @entity21 looked leggy and lacklustre			2
@entity39 , meanwhile , provided a breath of fresh air for @entity21 against @entity41 , invigorating @entity97 ’s attack with speed , strength and stamina before suffering an unfortunate injury which could ruin his @entity11			2
burnt out : @entity12 ( left ) struggled at the @entity102 as @entity13 four years earlier down and out : @entity16 ( centre ) struggled for @entity22 at the 2002 @entity11 data courtesy of @entity55			0
lead your team to glory in @entity55 @entity108			0
but is it any surprise that the @entity112 midfielder was so full of beans after running just 43.2 miles for @entity112 during an injury - interrupted season ? @entity43 played that night at @entity93 on the right wing – the position where @entity39 started in @entity117			1
while the @entity119 star has had a wonderful season , he also has plenty more miles in his legs than his @entity124 counterpart			1
a whopping 212.5 miles more in fact			2
when @entity97 selects his starting line - up for the opening clash against @entity128 he might also want to ponder the fact that six of the @entity21 squad feature in the top 20 players to have run the furthest in the @entity37 this season			1
as well as @entity43 and @entity48 , left - back @entity134 ( 211.3 miles ) is 11th on the list , captain @entity137 ( 210.4 ) is two places below him , striker @entity139 ( 203.6 ) is 16th and @entity140 ( 197.2 ) , another left - back , is 18th			1
meanwhile , the likes of @entity143 ( 128.9 ) , @entity144 ( 118.5 ) , @entity145 ( 109.0 ) and , surprisingly , @entity146 ( 147.7 ) have burned relatively small amounts of energy , which could mean they hold valuable reserves for the withering heat and humidity of @entity152			0
leading the way : @entity71 has run more miles than any other @entity37 player at the @entity156 powerhouse : @entity158 ( front ) was integral to @entity161 's @entity37 triumph @entity163 maestro : @entity164 will be looking to @entity165 ( left ) to pull the strings in @entity30 overcooked ? @entity137 and @entity140 ( right ) have put in the yards this season some of the biggest stars of the @entity37 also have plenty of miles in their legs			1
@entity22 striker @entity171 has covered 221.1 miles for @entity112 , while @entity158 – despite the perception of him as a languid midfielder – has run 215.6 miles , and bother are in the top eight in the list			1
@entity176 and @entity164 playmaker @entity165 is not too far behind on 206.8 miles			2
but several household names should still have plenty to give in @entity30 , such as @entity179 - providing he overcomes an injury scare for @entity85 – whose limited appearances for @entity182 mean he covered just 120 miles on the pitch last season			0
@entity84 striker @entity185 ( 115.1 ) and @entity186 forward @entity187 ( 102.5 ) should benefit from @entity189 ’s rotation of his front players at @entity176 , while @entity112 front man @entity191 ( 84.7 ) is another @entity192 forward who could have a spring in his step			0
but who should be the freshest out of every player at the @entity11 ? according to these statistics that honour falls to @entity199 striker @entity198 , who ran just 11.2 miles for @entity199 last season			1
@entity37 players heading to @entity30 and how far they have run			0

@entity43 ran more miles than any other @entity21 player
@entity119 star second on overall list with @entity48 third
