by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 20:00 est , 19 november 2012 @entity4 mayor @entity3 , arriving at the @entity2 conference today , warned against a tax raid on homeowners @entity7 yesterday ruled out creating new council tax bands on £ 1million homes as @entity3 denounced the idea as ‘ absurd ’			1
@entity11 and @entity12 have held talks about imposing new taxes on houses worth more than £ 1million			1
but @entity16 yesterday made clear that @entity17 will not countenance new council tax bands on high value properties or the @entity20 demand for a new tax on mansions			1
instead , the prime minister ’s official spokesman indicated that the chancellor could introduce a stamp duty increase for expensive properties in his @entity28 next month			2
making clear that new wealth taxes will be introduced , she said : ‘ as a point of principle we ’ve made it clear that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden			2
‘ we do n’t think that people who ’ve worked hard and saved up to buy a home should be hit with a mansion tax			1
‘ and we ’ve no plans to introduce new council tax bands either – we ’ve ruled out a re-evaluation in this parliament			1
’ but asked if @entity16 was ruling out a rise in stamp duty , she said : ‘ this is all a matter for the @entity28			2
’ the push by ministers to introduce new taxes on the wealthiest puts them at odds with the @entity4 mayor			2
mr @entity3 told the @entity2 conference in @entity4 : ‘ high rates of personal taxation are likely to make us less competitive			1
' we should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash - poor people who happen to inhabit expensive houses in @entity4			0
’ he urged politicians to be positive about businesses and stop talking about austerity and spending cuts as this puts ‘ a big downer on growth and enterprise ’			0
the mayor also encouraged foreign billionaires to sue each other in @entity4 and their wives to launch divorce proceedings here too , even though ministers have repeatedly called for an end to ‘ libel tourism ’			1
leaders : prime minister @entity17 ( right ) is blocking proposals to impose new council tax bands on high - value properties , which @entity11 ( left ) is open to he said @entity4 lawyers ‘ will be grateful for your business ’			1
he also encouraged couples to come to @entity89 to divorce , to boost @entity4 's legal services			1
' i would never encourage anyone to sue , but if one oligarch feels defamed by another oligarch , it is @entity4 's lawyers who apply the necessary balm to the ego , ' he said			0
' i have no shame in saying to the injured spouses of the world 's billionaires if you want to take him to the cleaners ... take him to the cleaners in @entity4			0
because @entity4 cleaners will be grateful for your business			0
' senior figures have told the @entity110 an increase in the rate of stamp duty on properties selling for seven figures or a rise in capital gains tax are much more likely			1
the @entity118 and the @entity20 admit that new wealth taxes for the best off are coming to justify another £ 10billion of cuts in welfare that are necessary to keep deficit - reduction plans on track			0
mansion tax : @entity12 ( pictured ) has held secret talks with @entity11 to draw up plans for a new tax raid on properties worth more than £ 1million mr @entity11 ’s aides yesterday played down reports that he has already agreed with mr @entity12 to push for new council tax bands , pointing out that he has publicly described them as unworkable			1
but two other sources revealed that the chancellor has told the @entity20 he is not opposed to new bands in principle			0
an ally admitted he regards the plans as ‘ impractical ’ rather than ‘ unacceptable ’			0
and government officials confirmed that some sort of new property tax – be it stamp duty or council tax – is ‘ on the table ’ as part of discussions by the @entity147 of the most senior ministers ahead of the autumn statement			1
mr @entity150 said : ‘ there needs to be a sense of fairness , and these best - off people in society have got to contribute more			0
there are arguments around taxation , about property taxation			2
‘ it ’ll all be resolved in the next few weeks			0
but certainly , the principle is right that the top of society , the best - off , have got to pay more			0
this is all under discussion			0
’ he added that property taxes were ‘ the obvious place to go ’ to tax wealth			1
‘ it is n’t simply that it ’s fairer – it ’s that property ca n’t run off to @entity172 and @entity173 ; if you ’re trying to deal with abuse of the tax system , this is the best way of doing it			1
’ ' there needs to be a sense of fairness , and these best - off people in society have got to contribute more			0
there are arguments around taxation , about property taxation ' @entity150 , business secretary treasury sources are at pains to claim that the chancellor is just as keen as the @entity20 to tax the wealthiest , not just as a quid pro quo for more welfare cuts			1
‘ we have always said the people with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden , ’ one said			0
‘ we ’re committed to that			0
it ’s not just some deal			0
’ the highest rate of council tax is currently @entity200 , levied on properties worth £ 320,000 or more in 1991 , but that means the super-rich in multi-million - pound mansions pay no more than many whose properties have simply grown in value to around £ 1million now			2
but sources close to mr @entity17 have indicated he does not support any change to council tax			2
‘ the prime minister is no great fan of property taxes and his view has n’t changed , ’ one said .			2
