defence minister @entity0 has failed to name the leader of terrorist organisation the @entity3 on the same day the @entity4 announced they would be sending more than 300 @entity6 troops to @entity7			1
@entity6 soldiers are embarking on a two - year mission in @entity7 , but will be spending it ' behind the wire ' not engaging in combat , mr @entity0 said			1
but during an embarrassing interview on the @entity15 's 7.30 program , the mr @entity0 declined to reveal the brutal regime 's leader			2
' can you name the leader of @entity28 ? ' sales asked			0
mr @entity0 replied : ' i 'm not going to go into operational matters			2
' but sales would not let him off the hook , saying : ' i do n't think that 's operational , i think it 's a matter of public record			2
' @entity22 is leader of notorious terrorist organisation @entity3 , which is wrestling to take power in @entity38 and @entity7 sales continued , saying given the @entity41 government had a $ 10 million bounty on his head , she was ' surprised ' he could n't name the terrorist leader			1
mr @entity0 argued @entity48 did not just have one leader because it was made of many groups and there was not just one individual involved			0
earlier that day , the prime minister announced @entity6 troops would return to @entity7 with the aim to provide @entity7 security forces with the skills and training to defend their country , to degrade and ultimately defeat the forces of @entity3 or @entity62			1
mr @entity0 said @entity6 troops would not accompany the @entity7 forces they train into battle			1
' no , they stay , to use the expression , inside the wire			0
they wo n't be going outside the @entity69 base			0
all the training will take place there , ' he told @entity15 television			0
mr @entity0 was appearing on 7.30 following the @entity4 's announcement 330 troops would be leaving for @entity7 this is a stark contrast with deployments over the past decade when troops conducted sweeping patrols across southern @entity7 , occasionally contacting insurgent forces			1
prime minister @entity82 announced on tuesday his cabinet had given the go - ahead for deployment of @entity69 , 330 @entity6 and 100 new @entity87 troops to train @entity7 soldiers for the next two years			1
mr @entity82 said @entity7 was a dangerous place and the mission was not risk - free			2
the joint force deployment this week coincides with the centenary of @entity93			0
mr @entity0 said the mission would be reviewed continually but there would be a formal review after 12 months			0
he said there had been an improvement with @entity7 forces ousting @entity99 from the city of @entity101			0
' so we are confident that there will be more gains over the next year to two and that 's what we 've made a commitment to , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 said 5,000 @entity7 troops had already been trained by four international training missions .			1

defence minister @entity19 was unable to name leader of @entity3
