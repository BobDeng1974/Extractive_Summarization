@entity1 @entity0 returns to public after an operation for skin cancer older men are at the fastest growing risk of the most deadly form of skin cancer , claim doctors			1
cases of melanoma have increased by 12 per cent every year in men aged 60 and over during the last two decades , according to official figures			0
older women have the next highest rate of increase , prompting experts to warn that awareness campaigns have been too focused on targeting the young on social media			0
malignant melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer , affecting more than 13,000 @entity22 annually and killing 2,000 patients a year			1
experts blame the explosion in package holidays by sun - seekers starting in the 1960s , as well as young people spending more time than ever before in pursuit of a tan that often leads to cancer - causing sunburn			1
health awareness campaigns using social media have targeted young people – melanoma is the most common cancer in women in their 20s			2
this means that older people may be missing vital information on the signs and symptoms of the disease , as it is not produced in formats that they would normally see			0
a study shows skin cancer rates in @entity50 are rising faster in older men than any other age group , according to a study being presented next week at the @entity54 on @entity55 in @entity56			1

cases of melanoma have increased by 12 per cent in men aged 60 and older women have the next highest rate of increase ( file photos ) the study also found thicker , more advanced tumours in older men are increasing at a greater rate – around 12 per cent a year compared with just six per cent in younger men			1

melanoma is more common in men on the back , where it is difficult to spot early changes in a mole			0
experts believe the rapidly rising rate in older people is partly because it is difficult to distinguish skin cancer from other harmless ailments , such as warts , that commonly develop in later life			1
older men also have the fastest rise in melanomas diagnosed on the trunk and upper limbs , at around a nine per cent increase per year			2
the findings are mirrored by an earlier study into skin cancer in the @entity108 population			0
it showed rates of melanoma trebling in men between 1979 and 2003 – with the greatest increases in those aged 60 and over			0

‘ this shows we need to address both our prevention messages , and our early detection messages , at older people as a matter of priority			0
