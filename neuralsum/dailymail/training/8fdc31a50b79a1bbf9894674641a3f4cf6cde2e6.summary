by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ deprived of talisman @entity3 , there is an apprehension consuming @entity5 as they approach the momentous @entity8 semi-final against @entity9 on tuesday evening			1
utterly dependent on the flair and inspiration of @entity3 so far in the competition , the onus will now be on the misfiring @entity14 and @entity15 to offer the creative spark to carry the host nation to a date with destiny at the @entity20 on sunday evening			0
however , as the @entity22 step out in @entity23 , it will be a peculiar feeling as @entity25 ’s side emerge without @entity3 for the first time in over two years and 38 international games at the @entity28			2
indeed , not since a 3 - 1 victory over @entity30 in may 2012 have @entity5 entered the field without @entity3 at their disposal			0
hero : @entity3 has carried the hopes of a nation on his shoulders during the @entity8 in his homeland perfect timing : @entity3 ( right ) scores for @entity5 against @entity40 in the opening game of this @entity8 rest on his shoulders : @entity3 offers @entity42 a hug before the last - 16 clash against @entity45 zero : the stricken forward lies in agony after breaking a bone in his back against @entity50 @entity5 have been defeated just four times over the course of the 38 - game period – the equivalent of an entire @entity56 season – and the tension that has paralysed the host nation since @entity59 crashed into the back of @entity3 on friday evening appears to have tangible foundation			1
* @entity3 has started @entity5 ’s last 38 matches , a run stretching back to may 2012			1
* @entity5 have played just six of the their last 60 matches ( including friendlies ) without @entity3 since 2010 @entity8			1
* last game @entity5 played without @entity3 was a 3 - 1 victory over @entity30 , may 26 , 2012			0
* they have won five of those six matches without him , none of which were competitive			0
* @entity74 matches @entity5 played without @entity3 since @entity75 …			1
2 - 0 v @entity76 ( 2010 ) 3 - 0 win v @entity78 ( 2010 ) 2 - 0 win v @entity80 ( 2011 ) 2 - 0 win v @entity82 ( 2011 ) 3 - 1 win v @entity30 ( may 2012 ) 1 - 0 loss v @entity84 ( feb 2011 ) @entity3 is the flame - haired poster boy of this @entity8 and the @entity22 , who have struggled to inspire even with the @entity87 superstar , will have to tap into their reserves of determination to ride a tidal wave of emotion and reach the final			2
the dependency on @entity3 has been well - documented , the @entity22 scoring four goals , committing opponents and making things happen almost single - handedly for his team			0
this reliance is nothing new , though , for @entity5 have gradually become increasingly dependent on @entity3 since they restructured their team around him following the disappointing quarter - final exit at the @entity75			2
in the 60 matches that @entity5 have played since the defeat by the @entity107 in @entity108 four years ago , @entity3 has played 54 , as he has emerged as the golden boy of the country under the guidance of @entity25			1
the 22 - year - old has represented his nation in every competitive game over the last four years , missing only six friendly games in that time			0
spot on : @entity3 scores during the shootout after @entity5 and @entity45 drew their last - 16 clash in @entity23 been there before : @entity3 scores a penalty against @entity121 in @entity122 during the @entity123 golden boy : the totemic forward celebrates another goal against @entity127 at @entity128 lots of heart : the 22 - year - old star had lit up the @entity8 , despite the intense pressure , before his injury as it transpires , @entity5 have fared relatively well in his absence , winning five of those six friendlies and losing one against @entity84			1
admittedly , though , the competition in those games was not the most arduous , as @entity5 defeated relatively accommodating opposition in the shape of @entity76 , @entity80 , @entity78 , @entity82 and @entity30 without the services of @entity3 , which rather skews the 83 per cent success rate without him in the side			0
suffice to say that tuesday evening against @entity9 will offer a rather more stern appraisal of this @entity5 team ’s credentials without their brilliant forward			2
watch the birdie : locals pose with a cut - out of @entity3 at @entity152 in @entity153 on song : @entity5 fans at @entity157 samba school in @entity153 watch @entity3 singing their national anthem standing vigil : a @entity5 fan outside @entity161 where @entity3 's injury was treated last friday			0

@entity5 take on @entity9 in @entity8 2014 semi-final on tuesday
hosts ' talisman @entity3 is ruled out with a broken *vertebra*
@entity87 forward is @entity5 's inspiration , as *statistics* prove
@entity3 has started last 38 matches for @entity5
@entity25 must rejig his team to make up for missing @entity3
