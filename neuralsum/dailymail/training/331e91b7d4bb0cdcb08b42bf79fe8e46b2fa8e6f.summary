the result - and the impressive performance - was a real statement from @entity78 ’s men , who are fancied to put last season ’s play - off final heartache behind them and return to the @entity81 via the automatic route			0
@entity7 have recorded some eye - catching results at home this season and are very much promotion candidates themselves but despite plenty of endeavour were unable to match their visitors			1

@entity78 , whose @entity13 side thrashed @entity97 5 - 0 to assume top spot a fortnight ago , brought in @entity1 for @entity60			1
the visitors started confidently , stroking the ball around and pressurising @entity7 ’s back line into some early errors			2
@entity59 ’s deflected shot from the edge of the box on five minutes was pushed onto the post by @entity107 as @entity4 showed their table - topping quality			2

@entity55 made a crucial slide challenge to deny @entity43 as he prepared to pull the trigger and @entity45 shrugged off the attentions of @entity126 to fire towards the bottom corner			0
@entity52 , who was unsighted , did brilliantly to turn it away one - handed			0

it needed a moment of magic to illuminate a dreary afternoon in @entity142 and @entity1 obliged			2
with @entity34 hopelessly out of position , the teenager got the better of @entity42 and bent the ball into the far corner			0
@entity1 , a south @entity147 lad who was signed by @entity10 two years ago , is regarded as a bright prospect and has represented @entity149 up to under 20 level			0

@entity18 shoots and scores to equalise for @entity7 in the 67th minute of the match substitute @entity18 gave @entity7 hope of a point against the @entity5 leaders on saturday it was a deserved lead for @entity4 and they could easily have doubled it when @entity57 ’s free - kick was flicked towards goal by @entity37 under pressure from @entity63 and @entity107 tipped it over			1
@entity90 introduced seven - goal top scorer @entity44 at half - time to try and provide some forward thrust and @entity45 tested @entity52 after @entity34 had beaten @entity1 down the right			1
a couple of minutes later , @entity42 made space on the edge of the box but curled a shot wide			0
at the opposite end , @entity63 was left kicking himself after finding himself clean through only to take the long way round @entity107 rather than aiming for the far corner			0
the keeper gratefully grabbed the ball from him			0
@entity7 gradually took a stranglehold on proceedings , with @entity18 also introduced and the man on loan from @entity183 drew them level after a lovely one - touch move on 67 minutes			1
@entity18 smashed the ball home after @entity44 played him through , the two substitutes combining to good effect			1
@entity4 manager @entity78 applauds the fans after securing the 2 - 1 win over @entity7 moments later , @entity44 could have given @entity7 the lead but he fired just off target from 20 yards and suddenly the hosts looked the most likely winner			1
however , @entity4 still had plenty going forward when they got the chance and @entity61 ’s strong run led to @entity134 being denied by @entity107 at point - blank range			1
but they did n’t have to wait much longer for their moment			0
@entity2 , who had replaced @entity58 , drove inside from the left and leathered the ball into the top corner from 25 yards			2
