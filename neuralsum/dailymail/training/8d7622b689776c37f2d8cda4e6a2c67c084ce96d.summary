a @entity1 mother has been left to bring up her daughter alone after her @entity4 husband was kicked out of the country – because he had cancer			1
distraught @entity7 , 56 , nursed her husband @entity9 , also 56 , when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia			1
but the @entity12 ruled he had become a burden on the taxpayer – despite having private health cover – after the @entity16 billed him £ 98,000 for the emergency cancer treatment he had received			1
family : @entity7 ( left ) , 56 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , nursed her partner @entity9 ( centre ) , also 56 , when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia			1
they have 10 - year - old daughter @entity24 ( right ) mrs @entity7 , a former @entity25 chief petty officer , watched helplessly as against medical advice he was escorted on to a plane and deported			1
the couple , from @entity19 in @entity20 , who have a ten - year - old daughter , @entity24 , married in 2001 but mr @entity9 chose not to apply for residency status			1
it meant the chemical engineer was allowed to stay in @entity1 for only six months at a time , but his work for an international company meant he often travelled abroad on business so the limit was not an issue			1
but his cancer diagnosis and hospital treatment meant he was at risk of over-staying his visitor status			2
mr @entity9 surrendered his passport in 2012 and applied for @entity1 residency			1
however , the @entity12 rejected it and ordered he leave @entity1 immediately			2
a later application from his new home in @entity50 was also rejected when the @entity12 ruled he was at risk of drawing on public funds			1
decision : the @entity12 ( whose offices in @entity56 are pictured ) ruled he had become a burden on the taxpayer and the @entity16 billed him £ 98,000 for the cancer treatment he had received partners of @entity1 citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the @entity67			1
they must prove that they and their other half are both over 18 , that their relationship is ' genuine and subsisting ' , that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under @entity1 law , and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the @entity1			0
@entity67 also requires proof that would - be @entity1 citizens have met their partner in person , that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under @entity1 law , and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down			2
finally the applicant must show that they meet @entity67 's list of ' suitability requirements ' , along with its @entity86 language requirement , and its financial requirement			0
this states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a @entity1 citizen must have an income of at least £ 18,600			0
if the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country , the minimum income goes up to £ 22,400			0
each additional child requires an additional income of £ 2,400			0
the @entity12 says the rules are intended to ensure people coming to @entity1 to join their spouse or partner do not become a burden on the taxpayer			1
in the case of @entity9 , his application was rejected after they ruled he would indeed be a burden			2
but mrs @entity7 claims when her husband was taken into hospital she revealed he had private health cover but was told that because his life was at risk his treatment would be on the @entity16			1
she said : ‘ i pointed out that @entity9 was n’t @entity1 but they were wonderful , telling me not to worry – as my husband , he was entitled to treatment			1
’ a judge upheld the family ’s appeal in january , but the @entity12 is contesting the decision and mr @entity9 continues to live in @entity4			1
the case is to be heard tomorrow			0
@entity24 has seen her father only once in the past year			2
mr @entity9 is currently in remission but has not had access to his medical team since he has been away			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i was stunned when the @entity12 rejected @entity9 ’s application			1
we ’d tried so hard to be positive , and after @entity9 had been so sick it was almost too much to bear			0
‘ to then receive the @entity16 bill made me feel like someone had thumped me in the stomach			0
’ the @entity16 has now dropped its demand for payment			0
mrs @entity7 added : ‘ i just do n’t know where to go now or what more we can do			1
‘ we ’ve provided every document they ’ve ever asked for and abided by all the rules			0
‘ with all the major issues the government has to tackle , i ca n’t believe they are working so hard to keep a decent , taxpaying family apart			0
it ca n’t benefit anyone			0
‘ the only person i ’ve managed to speak to at the @entity12 asked why we do n’t just go and live in @entity4			0
but this is our home			0
‘ i ’ve paid hundreds of thousands of pounds in taxes over the years and never received a penny in benefits			0
i understand that my husband is not entitled to any support – we ’ve never asked for any			0
’ across the pond : an application from mr @entity9 's new home in @entity50 was rejected when the @entity12 ruled he was at risk of drawing on public funds			1
a file image of @entity165 is pictured mr @entity9 said : ‘ the @entity12 is well aware that we are financially stable for the long term			1
‘ i can only pray that i will get to see my family soon			0
i miss them desperately and hate the pain this is causing my wife and little girl			0
‘ we are not scroungers			0
we can support ourselves and have done so all of our lives			0
but we are being treated as criminals			0
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we are appealing the decision because we believe it did not apply the immigration rules correctly			2
‘ our family rules have been designed to make sure that those coming to the @entity1 to join their spouse or partner will not become a burden on the taxpayer and will be well enough supported to integrate effectively			2
’ @entity190 @entity189 , 29 , told last year how he was facing having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away after being told he was not earning enough to keep them in the @entity1			2
mr @entity189 brought his son @entity194 , eight and five - year - old daughter @entity195 to live in @entity196 with him following the sudden death of their mother in their native @entity200			1
but despite mr @entity189 holding a @entity1 passport and having another son born in the @entity1 , under new immigration rules , @entity194 and @entity195 can not stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £ 22,500 a year			1
@entity208 , 23 , of @entity209 , served in the armed forces in @entity211 - but he earns just short of the £ 18,600 he needs to earn for his @entity213 wife to live in @entity1			2
this is despite him working 60 hours a week as a restaurant chef			0
@entity1 officials do not believe his wife - whom he met through a military friend - will leave if she comes to stay .			2
