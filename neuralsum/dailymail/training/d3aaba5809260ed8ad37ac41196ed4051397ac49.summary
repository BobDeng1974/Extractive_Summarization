by @entity0 you should never embarrass your mates to get in with a girl			1
it 's one of the golden rules of the brotherhood			2
the un-written rule , the sacrosanct tenet of the fraternity but i sort - of broke the rule this week but i 've got to say it was worth it when i got on over on @entity14 ( my father 's nickname for @entity0 , heir to the @entity19 's biscuit empire )			1
we were at a rather swanky pool party at the @entity23 hotel in @entity24 , @entity25 16th street			1
so fancy : @entity0 was joined by @entity14 and @entity26 at a swanky pool party at the @entity28 lots of @entity31 socialites sitting round the pool looking uber cool			1
everyone was subtly checking each other out and i was sat on a sun - lounger with the lovely @entity26 and @entity14 perched perilously close to the edge			0
i moved my hand over to @entity14 's shoulder barely concealing the fact i was already cracking up with laughter			0
@entity42 a bit of pressure – but he still had n't worked out my cunning plan			2
@entity0 could n't help but give @entity14 a dunking as he perched temptingly close to the pool 's edge cracking up : @entity0 had uncontrollable belly laughs as @entity14 landed head first in the pool drying off : @entity0 said that @entity14 saw the funny side of his prank ( eventually ) then push came to shove and my blond chum flipped off his lounger and straight into the pool in the most dramatic fashion possible			1
i could see quite a few of the other guests stifling a laugh but i was in fits			0
ms @entity26 was also amused			0
luckily @entity14 is one of the easiest going blokes in the world and he saw the funny side – and it gave him the opportunity to show off his new buff physique as he took off his soaking wet clothes			2
( clearly his new work out regime with the @entity74 fitness app and my @entity76 tablets is working			0
) @entity0 described the rave as a ' friendly riot ' mates : @entity0 made a few new friends at the party in @entity82 friends again : @entity14 appeared to have forgiven @entity0 for his pool prank later in the week we got a taste of what i imagine an @entity89 rave was like			1
clearly i 'm far too young to have experienced this myself , i was born in 1989 , the year after the second summer of love so all i know of that era of youth culture is from grey - haired former ravers who bang on about those halcyon days when everyone discovered love for others via the magic of house music and smiley t - shirts			0
but after experiencing a packed open - air dance event at the @entity104 in @entity82 i kind of got what everyone was on about			1
i can only liken it to being in a friendly riot			0
a couple of thousand @entity31 packed into a small space , with some serious eccentric types dotted around			1
no attitude or bad vibes just a lot of love in the room , man			0
all the best , @entity0 .			2

@entity0 attended a swanky pool party in @entity31 this week
while he was there he could n't help but dunk @entity0 in the pool
luckily all was forgiven and the pair headed for a rave in @entity82
