films could be downloaded to smartphones in just one second with new ultra-high speed mobile phone broadband technology , @entity0 has claimed			2
the fifth - generation technology will transmit data several hundred times faster than the 4g networks being rolled out across the country , says the communications giant			0
homes could have the wireless 5g system by 2020 using a vast network of masts , which may prove controversial but would mean an end to broadband cables to connect to the internet			0
@entity0 's @entity18 smartphone : the @entity20 giant has developed ' ultra-high speed ' fifth - generation technology that could allow users to download an entire film in a second @entity0 has been able to get speeds of 1 gigabit per second - far in excess of current 4g networks , which can makage 12 megabits per seconds			1
according to @entity0 , ' subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3d movies and games , real - time streaming of ultra high - definition ( @entity38 ) content , and remote medical services			1
' while @entity44 networks speed up standard downloads to about 13 minutes , subscribers of the new service would be able to download massive data files ‘ practically without limitation ’ , enabling almost instantaneous access to games and 3d movies or the ability to stream ultra high - definition programmes in real - time			1
the @entity20 company claims its technology uses high - frequency wavebands previously deemed unsuitable for mobile networks			2
@entity56 to it is the creation of what bosses say is the world ’s first transceiver capable of providing @entity62 to a wide area via a phone mast			0
@entity0 announced the breakthrough after tests in which data was transmitted at speeds of more than one gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres			1
however , analysts warned that faster downloads may mean bigger bills and raised health fears that new high powered broadcasts will fuel so - called ‘ electronic smog ’			0
@entity0 announced the development after conducting a test where data was transmitted at speeds of more than one gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres			2
customers using 4g services - currently provided in the @entity82 by @entity84 - access average speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second ( @entity85 )			0
' the new technology sits at the core of @entity62 mobile communications system and will provide data transmission up to several hundred times faster than current 4g networks , ' @entity0 said in a blog post			2
@entity0 has already trialled the technology over 2km distances , and found download speeds of 1 gigabit a second were possible , far higher than current 4g networks the company believes the equipment could provide a solution to recent surges in wireless internet usage			1
it added : ' @entity0 ’s new technology will allow users to transmit massive data files including high - quality digital movies practically without limitation			1
' as a result , subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3d movies and games , real - time streaming of ultra high - definition ( @entity38 ) content , and remote medical services			1
' in the blog post , @entity0 claims its technology uses high - frequency wavebands which were previously deemed unsuitable for mobile networks			1
it said : ' the implementation of a high - speed @entity62 cellular network requires a broad band of frequencies , much like an increased water flow requires a wider pipe			0
' while it was a recognised option , it has been long believed that the millimetre - wave bands had limitations in transmitting data over long distances due to its unfavourable propagation characteristics			0
' however , @entity0 ’s new adaptive array transceiver technology has proved itself as a successful solution			0
' it transmits data in the millimetre - wave band at a frequency of 28 ghz at a speed of up to 1.056 gbps to a distance of up to two kilometers			0

@entity0 claims system could allow live high definition 3d video to be *watched* in real timed
allows 1 gigabit of data to be transferred in a second - and could be available by 2020
