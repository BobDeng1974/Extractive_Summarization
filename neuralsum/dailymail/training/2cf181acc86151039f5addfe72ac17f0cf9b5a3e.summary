it has had more than £ 9 billion spent on its regeneration , and boasts a modern transport hub , @entity5 ’s biggest shopping mall and the vast @entity6			1
but today @entity7 in @entity8 is awarded a less welcome accolade as the country ’s worst crime hotspot – a magnet for muggers , pickpockets and thieves			1
analysis of official police figures by @entity18 reveals that the postcode covering the huge @entity21 mall is plagued by almost 200 offences every month			1
revealing : crime rates have been compared for every postcode in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 over the course of more than a year @entity29 has recorded 3,440 crimes in the area over the past 18 months , including 500 shoplifting offences , almost 300 violent crimes and hundreds of pick - pocketings and muggings			1
just last week five thugs were jailed over a gang fight inside the @entity38 in which a young man , @entity39 , was stabbed to death in front of horrified shoppers			0
in a further blow to the mall ’s @entity46 owners @entity44 , its other @entity8 shopping centre in @entity50 ’s @entity49 emerges as the site with the second - highest number of crimes – 2,524			1
airports where weapons are often seized from foreign visitors , railway stations haunted by beggars and football hooligans , and high streets where drinkers gather also see large numbers of arrests			0
but this newspaper ’s pioneering research has also uncovered some unlikely crime hotspots			1
they include a hospital in @entity27 where hundreds of violent attacks have been recorded , and a seaside resort on the @entity72 that has suffered more burglaries than anywhere else			0
music festivals such as @entity76 also trigger huge spikes in the usually sleepy countryside			0
it is the first time that crime rates have been compared for every postcode in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , each covering just a few hundred yards , over the course of more than a year			1
the data was taken from details uploaded by every police force in the country to a website maintained by the @entity89			1
@entity90 , the former policing minister who has championed crime maps , said last night : ‘ the power of crime mapping is putting information in the hands of people			2
' the information is no longer controlled by the authorities			0
it also means they are able to hold the authorities , including the police , to account			0
i think it ’s a brilliant example of opening up government and using data as a way of empowering citizens			2
’ @entity109 first developed the idea of plotting police records on maps that residents could search online to see how safe their neighbourhoods were , following successful projects in @entity116			2
the website crashed from high demand when it was launched nationwide in 2009			0
but it initially showed only offences across wide districts in a single month , and even when the @entity123 unveiled more precise data in 2011 there was criticism that some streets were wrongly being labelled crime hotspots			1
a quiet street in @entity129 was branded the country ’s worst place for anti-social behaviour – but only because dozens of hoax 999 calls had been included in statistics			1
householders feared the maps could damage property prices and even put up their insurance premiums			0
since then forces and @entity89 statisticians have improved the site so it narrowed down the location of incidents , listed a greater number of crime types and even revealed if the perpetrator has been caught			2
public places including railway stations and parks were added			0
the website , which costs £ 28,000 a month to maintain , was visited an estimated 548 million times in its first two years			2
it also allows anyone to upload the specific details of every offence to a spreadsheet , where they can be separated by type of offence and where the changing level of disorder can be plotted over time			0
the @entity89 website , police.uk , allows anyone to export details of crimes to a spreadsheet			0
these records include the type of offence , the force which recorded it , the month in which it took place and – crucially – its location			1
police plot the crime to one of more than 750,000 points on a map , which they anonymise slightly so that individual houses are not identified , in order to protect victims			2
this mapping information was translated into individual postcode data by @entity18 , so that every area ’s crime rates and trends could be compared and studied over time			1
police pinpoint the exact location of every crime they investigate , but to preserve the privacy of individual victims the setting is widened slightly when it is published online			2
the @entity18 has studied the details of all the offences recorded between january 2012 and june 2013 by the 44 forces in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , plus the @entity198			2
they show that 8,950,327 crimes took place in 548,171 individual postcodes , with more than half of areas suffering fewer than ten offences over the past year and a half			2
@entity206 – the public area that links @entity7 ’s bus and rail stations , the @entity44 shopping centre and the entrance to the @entity6 – emerged as the place with the highest number of crimes to its name : 3,440 , or 6.7 a day			1
this postcode , @entity217 , saw a record 291 offences in january this year			1
twelve months earlier there had been just 73 , while criminality also increased last summer as millions of spectators arrived to witness the @entity222			0
a spokesman for @entity29 said : ‘ in addition to the @entity225 which attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors , 12 concerts and anniversary athletic events have recently taken place , with an extra 660,000 people attending			0
‘ because of the high footfall , these areas attract criminal opportunists and therefore experience proportionately higher levels of crime			2
the @entity236 tackles this by deploying its resources to the areas where they are most needed			0
’ the @entity236 added that robbery had fallen by 5 per cent over the past 12 months in @entity242 , the borough where @entity7 is situated , and that anti-social behaviour orders were being used to tackle ‘ prolific shoplifters ’ as crime across the capital fell to its lowest level for a decade			1
senior @entity242 councillor @entity249 said : ‘ we have a zero - tolerance approach to crime and anti-social behaviour in @entity7 and across @entity242			1
‘ safety remains our residents ’ no 1 concern and we are investing more in making @entity242 safer			0
‘ crime and anti-social behaviour is unacceptable and we will never apologise for being tough on those who make the lives of the hard - working majority a misery			0
’ the council funds police community support officers and has set up a ‘ dispersal zone ’ so gangs of youths can be kept away from the centre of @entity7			1
a spokesman for @entity44 insisted the postcode covered a wider area than its shopping centre alone , and added : ‘ as a proportion of high customer numbers visiting our centres , the incident levels at @entity44 are very low			0
‘ the safety of our customers , retailers and residents is a key priority			0
@entity44 has on - site police teams and works closely with the @entity236 , local authorities and retailers to ensure its centres are a safe and enjoyable place for our customers			0
’ @entity290 ’s crime maps show slightly different pictures when larger districts are compared			1
the postcode area – covering dozens of buildings – registering the highest number of crimes is still @entity217 1 , but it is followed by ne1 5 in central @entity297 and @entity298 1 in @entity299			0
the wider postcode district – covering areas where about 20,000 people live – with the highest number of crimes turns out to be @entity304 in @entity305 in @entity306 , followed by @entity307 on the south bank of the @entity309 and @entity310 in @entity311 , @entity312			0
in the most recent month for which figures are available – june this year – @entity315 in @entity316 was the postcode with the highest number of crimes ( 300 ) as the download music festival came to town , followed by @entity322 in @entity323 , with 220 – site of the @entity76 music festival			1
@entity326 was @entity206 in @entity7 ( 202 offences ) and fourth was @entity328 in @entity312 , where the @entity329 played two gigs ( 167 crimes )			1
we said a street in @entity334 near a large police station , @entity336 , records high levels of drug crime – in fact the offences were recorded at @entity342 station when offenders were arrested and found to have drugs on them			1
we also said an airport in @entity346 had high levels of violence but the offences in fact related to nearby @entity351 .			0

it is a magnet for muggers , pickpockets and thieves
