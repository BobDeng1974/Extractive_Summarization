a sick little girl is being kept alive thanks to her best friend – a dog who carries her oxygen tank on her back			1
@entity8 ’s faithful canine companion mr @entity7 has been specially trained to shepherd the three - year - old , who breathes though a tube most of the time			1
he follows her closely as she plays in her family 's ten - acre land in @entity14 , @entity15 , uses the slide or even rides her bike			2
but it is very difficult for her and mr @entity7 is on hand for when she needs the oxygen			2
it also means she can move around without having to carry the heavy canister herself			0
often the pair move about in tandom as she plays while breathing through the tube and he runs alongside her			0
' my best dog ' : the toddler cuddles mr @entity7 at her home in @entity14 , @entity15 the tubes can be reinserted into the tank if they come out			1
but it is not that easy for a toddler to do and her parents prefer them to be removed only when they are close to hand			0
her rare condition was only discovered in 2005 and has just 800 documented sufferers worldwide , it causes diseased pieces of the lungs to filter oxygen through extra layers of cells making it hard or almost impossible to breathe			2
for @entity8 , and her parents @entity58 and @entity60 , it meant that even a walk in the park was very difficult because equipment was too heavy for the youngster to be able to carry herself			2
as parents they wanted to do something to help their daughter navigate life despite having a tube trailing her at all times			0
the couple found out about ' service dogs ' from a tv programme and realised an animal trained to help the blind could be trained to help @entity8			1
they found help in the shape of golden doodle - a retriever crossed with a poodle - dog mr @entity7 and even moved 2,000 miles from their native @entity83 so @entity8 and mr @entity7 could be together			1
the family realised there was a long waiting list for service dogs and did n't want to take one away from someone else who might need it more on the list			0
now - thanks to trainer @entity8 and mr @entity7 love nothing more than playing and running around together with the dog literally acting as @entity8 's life saver			1
@entity8 loves mr @entity7 so much she said : ‘ he 's my best dog			1
’ by her side : mr @entity7 beside @entity96 at @entity97 always around : mr @entity7 follows @entity8 down a slide as she momentarily breathes without her oxygen tubes family : mr @entity7 and @entity8 with her parents @entity58 and @entity102 and her baby sister mrs @entity8 , 39 , a nurse , said @entity8 and mr @entity7 were growing up together and learning all the time			1
she said : ‘ @entity8 never complains about her condition , at the moment we she does have a habit of trying to pull out her tubes though , we have to tell her that 's not a good idea			1
‘ she loves mr @entity7 and he loves her too			0
we 're trying to make life easier for her and she 's just now starting to realise she 's different , but as the bond between her and @entity7 gets stronger , we think things will get better			0
‘ as a pair they do work well together , mr @entity7 has the oxygen tank on his back and then @entity8 has his leash			1
’ loving : @entity8 , who suffers from a rare condition called neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy , has learned to rely on mr @entity7 , who - in turn - has become a doting and attentive dog trip : @entity8 and mr @entity7 on a family holiday to @entity132 where they were dwarfed by a giant @entity135 toy , right having fun : @entity8 , who was diagnosed with the condition at age eight months , lies on the floor with mr @entity7 mrs @entity8 said @entity8 was born premature and when they first brought her home she was given oxygen as a precaution			1
canine companion : @entity8 and mr @entity7 are rarely apart she said : ‘ she was on oxygen just to make sure she would make it through , but by eight months doctors became worried she still needed it			1
‘ it was then that they told us she had @entity25 , it 's so rare that it was only discovered in 2005 and there have been only 800 cases worldwide			0
‘ there is some good news because the damaged tissue in @entity8 's lungs is not growing so as her lungs grow and the healthy tissue increases we 've been told that eventually she may be able to do without the oxygen during the day			1
‘ @entity8 knows she is different , she calls the oxygen her ' o ' and she tells us if needs more because she can feel if she is getting low			1
‘ mr @entity7 is still a young dog and obviously @entity8 is still too young to give him too many commands but the pair of them are growing up together			2
’ mrs @entity8 is now working with the @entity170 foundation charity to raise $ 30,000 to help families both in the @entity172 and the @entity173 with research into the new disease			2
@entity58 said : ‘ we 're trying to provide some independence for her , and then , after we saw this programme on tv , we thought , ' what about a service animal ? '			0
‘ he 's still learning , he 's very much a puppy in some ways , playful and gangly			0
but when he wears the vest , he 's all business and does really well , even in public			0
’ ‘ we have to train him to follow @entity188 's directions , he follows our instructions , but getting him to listen to a three - year - old is harder			0
but he 's getting used to her			0
’ happy : mr @entity7 gives @entity188 hope despite the incredible hardship she must endure every order the family gives , @entity8 has been taught to echo , and the dog is starting to accept her as his charge , the pair even managed to negotiate the crowds on a recent family holiday to @entity201			2
the family is currently raising funds for research into @entity25			0

@entity8 can run and play with dog as he follows her while carrying oxygen
she can survive *briefly* if tubes come loose from tank on golden doodle
@entity217 moved 2,000 miles so she could be with specially - trained animal
