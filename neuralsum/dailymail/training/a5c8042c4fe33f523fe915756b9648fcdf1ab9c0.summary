as she fights for her life in @entity18 , the outlook so far has been grim since her disease is 99 - percent fatal and most victims die within a week , according to the @entity21			0
but @entity9 's mom , @entity22 , recently stated that she is confident her daughter will be one of the few survivors			2
raised hopes : hopes have been raised for 12 - year - old @entity9 who is fighting for her life after contracting a rare and extremely deadly brain - eating amoeba two weeks ago ‘ it has been a very emotional couple days			1
@entity9 has reached for my hand , she has squeezed my hand , and she has moved her head , ’ her mother optimistically wrote on @entity35 last night			2
‘ to a mom that has been through what i have the past two weeks			0
this has been the answer to my prayers			0
i feel so blessed to have my baby @entity9 still her and all the support we are getting from all our family and friends , also from total strangers ! ‘ please keep praying for my baby and i will keep the updates coming			1
thanks again everyone for the out pour of love an support for @entity9 and our whole family ! ’ @entity54 is indeed awake now as doctors are lowering her level of sedation , @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity8 reports			1
good signs : only two people in the world have survived amoebic meningitis and her mother is confident that @entity9 will be the third @entity9 is the second person to have come down with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in three years after swimming in the sandy - bottom lake at @entity68 near @entity59 , @entity8			1
only two people in the world are known to have survived the extremely rare @entity71 infection since the @entity21 began tracking it in 1962			1
@entity9 's family has been praying for her to be the third survivor			1
her mother @entity74 has had t - shirts made for family and friends with a large , bold number ' 3 ' beneath the word 's ' @entity79			2
' ' this is @entity82			0
number three stands for the third person who will survive this amoeba disease			1
my daughter @entity9 , ' she told @entity89			2
' we are just going to take baby steps , but other than that , she 's doing remarkable			0
she 's a little miracle			0
' the condition is caused when the @entity71 parasite enters a patient 's brain , usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant , warm water up the nose while swimming			1
@entity8 @entity101 spokesman @entity100 told @entity102 the water must be forcefully , almost violently , pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water , being dunked or using a water slide			1
@entity71 are be found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes			1
but , they only become active when water heats up			0
the cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from the heat			0
@entity9 's mother says her condition at @entity18 is improving and the family remains hopeful she will recover - despite the astronomically slim odds closed : the owners of @entity68 near @entity59 , @entity8 , have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific			1
it is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim 's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses			1
the amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive			0
it grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm , stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees			0
the water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans			0
health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the @entity15 in the last 50 years			0
only one person has survived in the @entity15			0
one other survivor was found in @entity154 health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by : the @entity21 says there have been 128 cases of the disease in the @entity15 in the last five decades - making the disease extremely rare , when compared to the number of lakes and muddy swimming holes @entity15 dip into for refuge from the summer heat each year			2
the amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees , @entity100 said			0
however , this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at @entity68			2
in august 2010 , 7 - year - old @entity172 died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake			2
because two cases have been seen from the same body was water , state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole			2
' though the odds of contracting @entity71 are extremely low , they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim , ' owners @entity181 and @entity182 said in a statement			2
the park , which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by @entity59			1
@entity9 's mother @entity195 said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease			1
' you 're a mom , you 're a dad			0
you can still take your child swimming			0
we do n't want to scare people			0
we just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out			0
so they can go and still be a kid , ' she said			0
she encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the @entity71 parasite			1
still , @entity100 , of the health department , says that swimmers really should n't be too concerned about the the @entity15 has recorded just 128 cases of naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years another tragedy : @entity172 , 7 , died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the @entity68 - where little @entity9 is believed to have been infected			1

@entity9 , 12 , contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after swimming at @entity68 near @entity59 , @entity8
