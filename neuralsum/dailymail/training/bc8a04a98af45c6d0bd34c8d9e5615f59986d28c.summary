she had two other son 's die young , including a three - year - old that died at sea he was among 10 other boys aged under 15 who served in the merchant navy during the @entity4			1
meanwhile @entity6 gained the @entity54 medal , which he was posthumously awarded for his service on a different vessel			1
the schooner , a ship with two or more masts , was built in 1878 by @entity60 in @entity61			2
figures show 14,287 @entity64 merchant navy sailors died during @entity4			2
the deadly @entity15 uc - 72 submarine downed 38 ships during the war using a deadly combination of torpedoes and mines			1
both sets of medals , along with bronze plaques given to their relatives after they died , will go under the hammer at @entity76 in @entity77 in july			1
medal expert @entity78 , who is handling the sale , said : ' only a handful of boys @entity18 's age would have served in the merchant navy			0
' there has been some confusion over his age , because his descendants who gave us the lot believed him to be 15			0
' but records in the @entity91 show him to be 14			0
family portrait : @entity1 ( left ) with older brother @entity93 ( right )			1
the 13 - year - old was a cook on the ship @entity1 was awarded the @entity37 , which was a campaign medal of the @entity98 , for service in @entity4 it was given to officers and men of @entity64 and @entity103 forces who had served between 5 august 1914 and 11 november 1918			1
it was later given to those involved in the min clearing the years afterwards			0
one side of the silver disk features @entity110 bareheaded effigy , facing left , while the other side shows @entity112 , on horseback with a shirt sword			0
there were 6,500,000 of these medals issued			0
the 13 yeah old was also given a @entity38 , which was as awarded by the @entity116 of the @entity64 to members of the @entity118			1
the bronze medal also features @entity110 , but the reverse show a a merchant ship sailing through stormy seas , an enemy submarine sinking and a sailing vessel in the background			2
@entity18 's father @entity6 was awarded the @entity54 medal for services on a different vessel during he war			1
' however , when we dug further we saw that the 1911 census put his birth year as 1904 , which would make him 13 years and nine months old - one of the youngest sailors in the war			1
' the fact he died with his father makes it such a poignant story , because in all my years of historical study we have never encountered a similar instance			1
' @entity18 and @entity6 were sailing with ship 's mate @entity144 , dubliner @entity145 , and @entity147 who was born in @entity148			2
despite the risks of attack from enemy submarines @entity6 's wife @entity149 and his daughter would sometimes accompany them on their trips up and down the channel			2
the medal collection is expected to fetch £ 600 - £ 800 at auction but could reach a higher price			1
mr @entity78 added : ' we 've put a relatively low estimate on it i would say , but with something like this the sky 's the limit			0
' there are loads of medal collectors out there , and a lot with a story like this will inevitably attract a lot of attention			0
' we 've got them from descendants of the family , who for whatever reason feel no connection to the pieces			0
' it 's surprising how common it is for families to sell off heirlooms you think would have priceless sentimental value			0
' the @entity1 family experienced a huge amount of tragedy in the early 1900 's			2
@entity18 's older brother , who shared his name , died in his infancy and another brother died at sea when he was just three years old			2
@entity44 and @entity1 are both commemorated on the @entity197 at @entity198 , @entity199			2
their names are also recorded on the war memorial in their home town of @entity205 , @entity9			0
remembrance : @entity1 and @entity44 are remembered on a war memorial in @entity205 , @entity9 @entity1 and @entity44 are remembered on a war memorial			2
@entity18 is one of the youngest victims of the conflict for king and country : many young boys replied to lord @entity216 's call for volunteers while a 13 - year - old boy at war was an unusual sight , @entity4 brought out the patriotic side of the nation			2
this led tens - of - thousands of men to answer lord @entity216 ’s call for volunteers , and to sign up at their local recruitment office			0
the swell in national pride encouraged thousands of underage boys who were willing to lie about their age and identity to try and get a piece of the action			0
you had to be 19 to legally sign up to go to war , if you were 18 you could enlist but not go abroad			0
but , come the start of @entity4 , recruitment officers took the role that it a young man wanted to enlist and was physically able to do so , then there was no reason to stop him			0
it is impossible to know for certain how many boy soldiers there were during @entity4 , but it is thought that as many as 250,000 underage boys enlisted and went abroad			0
some young boys not only lied about their age , but their name as well			0
this ensured that worried parents could not track their sons down and report them to their commanding officer			0
even gravestones in war grave cemeteries show the ‘ official ’ ages , or the ones that the boys claimed to be			0
it is thought that by the end of the war , many of the young boys who were so desperate to fight for @entity212 and country had been injured or killed			0
