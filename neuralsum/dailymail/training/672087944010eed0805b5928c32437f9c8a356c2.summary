' i realise there 's plenty of controversy around alkalised water , but i would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water , as it works out cheaper in the long run , and is environmentally friendly			0
' @entity53 @entity52 president @entity51 hit back at the outspoken chef telling @entity55 that @entity0 needed to stick to what he does best			1
some slogans on the @entity58 that @entity0 is a passionate advocate for @entity0 and his family do n't drink tap water ' all evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities , the @entity64 , and by the @entity65 points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay , ' dr @entity51 said			1
' celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the @entity4			1
' ' people like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking			2
