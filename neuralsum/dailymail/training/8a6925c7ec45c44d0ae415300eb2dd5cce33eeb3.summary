traditionally for cats , it 's always been about getting the cream - so the old saying goes			1
but it appears the bar has been raised a tad higher - with champagne , wads of cash and even handguns now the desired possession of choice			2
as this bizarre gallery shows , the world 's richest cats are so well - off that they spend their time rolling around in piles of $ 100 notes , complete with a serving of @entity20 on the side			1
are you fur real ? this ' cashcat ' strikes a pose for the camera while surrounded by hundreds - and two guns @entity28 : a bow - tie wearing ginger cat sits in front of $ 100 notes - and a bottle of cognac @entity35 : this serious - looking puss stares threateningly as he guards his wads of £ 20 notes land of wad : this fluffy feline curls up for an afternoon nap amid a scattered piles of $ 20 notes not a pawper : this cat poses among $ 100 notes , three passports , a large knife - and a refreshing drink the images feature on a website called cashcats.biz , a site set up to celebrate the ' top one purrcent ' of rich moggies			1
featuring pets from the @entity61 to the @entity62 , this gallery of cats has become such an online sensation that only five per cent of submissions are ever used			1
creator @entity65 , 35 , said : ' one of the most fun aspects of the project is how varied the submissions are from a geographic perspective - every continent except @entity71 is represented			1
' i ca n't even count all of the countries and types of currencies featured			0
' the website invites wealthy pet owners to post photos of their smug - looking cats surrounded by the trappings of their wealth			1
the ' cashcats ' started out posing among wads of cash , but champagne , @entity20 and other luxurious good soon started appearing in the background			1
now mr @entity65 is inundated with images showing the cats set up among loaded guns and illegal drugs			1
ring of purr - fection : this sleeping feline is unfazed by her protective layer of crisp - looking bank notes feline rich : this adorable black cat snuggles up inside a blanket of $ 1 notes @entity100 : this ' cashcat ' lies among $ 20 notes - and an obligatory handgun cat that got the cream : this moggy is so chuffed with its collection of bank notes , it even stuck his toungue out at the photographer he said : ' i 've received a lot of submissions with cats surrounded by huge piles of drugs , because some folks who have $ 10,000 in cash lying around also have those things handy			1
' i do n't publish pictures like that for several reasons , mainly to ensure we do n't set a bad example or create an unsafe environment for cats			2
' we do occasionally publish pictures of cats who own guns , and evidently a lot of cats own guns around the world , which is surprising			2
' the site is really just mirroring our culture - particularly rap culture - and how we think about power and status			0
for some people power is a passport and a bottle of @entity145 , for others it 's a glock			2
' the digital marketer says he was inspired to start the site by his fiancé 's cat @entity153 , who has starred on the site several times			0
keeping it capital : this smug - looking duo pose among piles of £ 20 , £ 10 and £ 5 notes working from home : this pair of adorable kittens show off their loot in a fan of £ 20 notes i should buy another boat : another ' cashcat ' looks pensive as he deliberates his stash of $ 100 notes busy earnin ' : this moggy yawns as he nestles beneath a sea of £ 20 and £ 10 notes despite modest beginnings , @entity179 now has accounts on @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 , thanks to submissions flowing in from around the globe			1
mr @entity65 said : ' it 's very diverse			1
i definitely get a lot of submissions from people who work in " cash only industries " , if you will			2
' only about five per cent of several thousand submitted photos end up making the site			0
consider the site like an exclusive vip room for high net worth felines			0
' to make it even harder - cats will not model for you , hold still , or bend to your will			0
any photo shoot must be on their terms			0
' extra cover : this cute - looking kitten puts on a second coat of crisp £ 10 notes pawsing for thought : this black and white beauty stops to reflect as it works it way through its wad of £ 20 notes @entity216 lifestyle : this wealthy duo spread themselves out among a pile of £ 100 notes and a bottle of bubbly money in the kitty : two cute ginger and white cats peek out from their money - laden cubby hole despite the owners ' desire to flash the cash , mr @entity65 is clear that the cats are the real stars of the website			1
' we all know that cats are slowly taking over the internet , partly because we do n't really understand them , ' he said			0
' cats are the only species who have managed to domesticate us , and they love how we have n't really figured that out yet			0
' the site helps us to see cats how they see themselves - their facial expressions , which can convey power , status , mystery and an air of confidence that we ca n't exactly place			0
that ' one purrrcent ' look			0
' richer than mew : this feline sprawls across a bundle of $ 100 notes puss in loots : these two cats star each other out as they pose with their weapons and money living it up : this cat has so much cash in front of him , he can barely stand to look at it he also said the feedback on the site has been overwhelmingly positive			1
he said : ' people send thank you notes on @entity184 saying it helped them get through a tough time , which is completely unexpected but awesome to hear			0
' on social media , there is also a lot of self - identification , and i think that 's why people share it on their own personal channels so much			0
' it 's a way of saying " this is me when i get paid next week " or " i need to get my cat on this site , my cat needs to ball as hard as these cats "			2
' @entity288 in it : this grey cat writhes happily in a scattered pile of $ 100 bills tucked away : a grey cat sits regally on rolls of @entity61 dollars - while his paw rests on a handgun international mogul : another ' cashcat ' spreads itself over a fan of @entity62 bank notes			0
