by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 can remember the hours he spent searching for his name on the internet when he was on the verge of a £ 50million move to @entity6 during @entity7			1
‘ i used to go to my room and read the papers and go on the internet ... i was driving myself mad thinking about whether i should go to @entity6 or not , ’ he has recalled of that time			0
the uncertainty scrambled his brain and @entity1 ’s weak back - pass in the opening group game against @entity16 helped gift @entity18 ’s side victory			2
distraction ? @entity21 has not yet signed a new deal at @entity6 and could be on his way to the @entity24 affect : @entity1 remembers how being linked with @entity6 affected him during @entity7 despite @entity28 wanting no talk of transfers surrounding his @entity32 players now they have started their @entity35 training camp , the futures of seven of the 23 - man squad are not yet settled … goalkeeper @entity36 ( @entity37 ) club interested : tottenhamestimated value : £ 4m defender @entity40 ( @entity42 ) clubs interested : @entity43 , @entity45 value : £ 27m @entity47 @entity46 ( @entity42 ) clubs interested : @entity48 , @entity50 value : £ 25m @entity51 ( @entity52 ) clubs interested : @entity53 , @entity55 value : £ 10m @entity21 ( @entity6 ) clubs interested : @entity56 , @entity58 value : free @entity60 @entity59 ( @entity42 ) club joining : liverpoolestimated value : £ 4m @entity63 ( @entity64 interested : tottenhamestimated value : £ 15m on sunday , as @entity32 ’s @entity35 squad arrived in @entity68 for the second phase of their preparations , this familiar issue was dominating the agenda again			1
at least four @entity32 players — vice-captain @entity21 , @entity46 , @entity40 and @entity59 — are involved in decisions over their club futures			1
which brings us to head coach @entity28 and his claim that ‘ when we ’re together , it ’s @entity32 and purely @entity32 and we ’re not going to combine the two things ’			1
already the lines are blurred			0
the clubs should be showing the national team more respect ahead of the @entity35			0
@entity32 is all that should count			0
@entity28 has banned agents from the team hotels , but he is well aware that the players ’ mobile phones will be buzzing when they retire to their rooms			2
there is already some wriggle room , though , and @entity28 will let players have medicals during their seven - day stay in @entity68			1
@entity21 ’s £ 150,000 - a - week contract with @entity6 expires on june 30 and a move to @entity24 is under consideration			1
he has an offer from @entity6 for another season and manager @entity98 wants the midfielder to start his coaching badges			0
at 35 , @entity21 is equipped to handle the situation better than most , but it is still a distraction as he prepares to captain @entity32 against @entity105 in the @entity106 here in @entity68 on wednesday			1
focus : @entity32 boss @entity28 will have to keep his players ' minds on the job in hand despite transfer rumours uncertain : @entity42 pair @entity46 and @entity40 are being linked with big - money moves then there is the @entity116			1
@entity59 ’s move to @entity48 for a knockdown £ 4m is almost complete			2
he was given permission by @entity28 to travel to @entity119 on saturday for a medical and the transfer is expected to be completed today			0
@entity46 played on with a groin strain in the final two matches of @entity42 ’s season because he was so desperate to say goodbye to the supporters			0
his heart is set on a move to @entity48 ( @entity46 was an @entity128 fan growing up ) to play @entity130 football			0
there is much to discuss but he has been made aware @entity132 intends to play him in a role behind @entity134 and @entity135 next season			0
@entity137 bound ? @entity36 has been linked with a move to @entity139 linked : @entity63 is another player being mooted to join @entity140 at @entity141 @entity40 , the junior member of the @entity32 squad , is expected to leave @entity143 ’s for @entity43 after the @entity35			1
what counts for @entity32 is getting all four to focus on international football			0
that , as @entity1 illustrated at @entity7 , is easier said than done .			2

@entity32 captain @entity1 remembers possible £ 50m move to @entity6 distracted him during @entity7
at least four players - @entity21 , @entity46 , @entity40 and @entity59 - face questions over their futures
@entity28 will want players to be completely focused on @entity35
@entity36 , @entity51 and @entity63 also uncertain of future
