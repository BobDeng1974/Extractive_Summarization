@entity0 have barely been in @entity1 a day but the early indications are they are ready to give @entity3 the chance to reinvent himself as an international opener			1
@entity3 , @entity0 ’s rock at @entity7 for four years before his early return home from the 2013 - 14 ashes series in @entity11 with a stress - related condition , was picked for this three - @entity15 tour of the @entity16 after fighting his way back into contention			1
all the talk before the team ’s departure may have been about @entity22 but the real focus of this tour is likely to fall on another @entity26 - born batsman in @entity3			0
@entity3 during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play the 33 - year - old has been impressive in not only addressing the personal demons which led to his departure from @entity32 but also scoring the weight of runs needed to demand a recall			2
@entity36 knows the value an in - form @entity3 would bring to his side ’s chances of recording a series win in the @entity16 that is vital not only for his own future as @entity15 captain but that of coach @entity43 , whose job security is at perilous levels			2
@entity36 admits @entity0 will not be totally sure if @entity3 can handle the mental demands of international cricket until he is pitched into the heat of battle again.but he is likely to be given the chance to re-establish himself in the team , this time as @entity36 ’s opening partner , during the two warm - up matches against a @entity54 this week			1
test captain @entity36 feels the batsman is ready for international cricket return @entity3 ( left ) and @entity36 train together during a batting session at @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity1 & @entity60 the first of those two - day encounters starts here tomorrow and if @entity3 can show the same form he displayed during the @entity65 tour of @entity66 earlier this year then he looks certain to see off the challenge of @entity70 opener @entity68 and make his 50th @entity15 appearance in @entity72 a week tomorrow			1
‘ i am confident he can handle it , ’ @entity36 said			0
‘ you do n’t know 100 per cent until he ’s put out in the environment			0
there are a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you ’re put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and make no mistake , it ’s a high - intensity environment			0
‘ but what we do know is he ’s a quality player			0
’ the @entity87 batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call - up @entity3 looks for a single during a training session at @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity1 & @entity60			2

@entity3 will be given chance to reinvent himself as an opener
@entity36 feels @entity3 is ready to return to the @entity0 squad
