@entity0 opened a communal door at his block of flats in @entity3 , @entity4 when he heard a man banging			1
but the 56 - year - old 's life was forever changed in that fateful moment when he opened the door as a second men squirted his face and upper body with acid			1
the retired chauffeur - who had worked for pop supremo @entity25 - rushed back inside his home screaming in pain looking in his mirror to see his face ' melting '			2
mr @entity0 has now bravely allowed pictures of his injuries , taken whilst he was in hospital , to be released in the hope it will lead to arrests			1
describing the horror attack , he said : ' i thought to myself , naively , why is this man squirting juice in my face ? ' i put my hand up to protect myself , the guy carried on spraying it down my back , neck and shoulder			1
' i took some of it in the mouth and swallowed it , it turned my face and some of my teeth black			2
' within seconds , the pain was unbelievable			0
i put my hands up to my face , turned and ran back into the flat			1
' i looked into the mirror in the bathroom and it looked like my face was melting			2
' mr @entity0 was rushed from his home to a specialist burns unit at @entity59 in @entity60			1
he has undergone a series of skin grafts since the attack but doctors have warned him that he will be scarred for life			2
he remains mystified as to why he was attacked but believes it was a case of mistaken identity , simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time			2
he said one of his two attackers shouted ' 55 ' as he opened the door , but that was not the number of his ground - floor flat			2
crime scene : mr @entity0 has moved out of his home , above , because of the emotional impact of the attack mr @entity0 has undergone weeks of painful skin grafts following the attack last month to repair the damage done			1
he believes it was only the quick thinking of paramedics that saved him			0
' i managed to get to the phone and call 999			0
i was just screaming down the phone for them to come quick			0
it felt like it took 10 hours for them to come , but it was more like 10 minutes			0
' if it was n't for the paramedics ' quick thinking it could have been a lot worse - they rushed me into the shower and washed me down for ages - i 'd really like to thank them			0
' ' after the skin grafts , my legs looked like raw steaks , but the doctors are happy with the way the grafts have taken and have to moisturise my skin daily			0
police have released e-fits of the two men they want to speak to in connection with the chemical attack the horrific incident was particularly tough on mr @entity0 , who had to sell his photography business after suffering a stroke and brain haemorrhage in 2006 and had to learn to walk and talk again			1
he is hoping that his attackers will see the impact of what they have done and give themselves up to police			1
he said : ' until a few weeks ago my face was still black			2
i just want to know what gives them the right to do this to an innocent person , to destroy my life and my son 's and daughter 's ; we 've all been through hell			0
' unbelievable pain ' : the father of two has had to have skin grafts following the injuries he suffered in the attack ' i still feel terrible - my confidence is on the floor , i still get flashbacks of a guy throwing the acid on me then running around the corner			2
' i just want them caught and brought to justice			0
if they can do it to me they can do it to someone else			0
' @entity160 @entity159 from @entity161 said : ' the photographs clearly show how @entity0 suffered appalling injuries in this incident			1
' he has asked us to release them to show what these people are capable of causing and how they have to be taken off the streets and brought to justice			0
' it is believed that this was a case of mistaken identity and extensive investigations have shown that there is no evidence that anyone in the area was the intended victim in this crime			1
' we have now widened our enquires in to the @entity182 area but we are still hoping that people in @entity3 may remember seeing the two men in the e-fits			0
' we also hope that someone might remember seeing the two men up to half an hour before the incident occurred			0
we believe that they seemed to be lost and were wandering around looking at property numbers before arriving at the flats			0
' we know they had a blue @entity193 or hatchback - style vehicle that was seen in the area but we have no information about the index number or anything else that would help us find it			0
' anyone who recognises the men in either e-fit or who has other information about the attack is asked to call @entity161 at @entity206 on 101 or ring @entity207 anonymously on 0800 555 111			1
