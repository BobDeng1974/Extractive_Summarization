@entity9 , a nature reserve warden for @entity11 , had taken his dog @entity12 for some exercise near his home in @entity16 , @entity17			1
to his amazement , the 52 - year - old saw a sea of white seeds in the distance as he took his flat - coated retriever for a morning stroll			1
this was the scene in a field in @entity16 , @entity17 , today , as photographed by dog walker @entity9 mr @entity29 could barely see the green grass in the field as thousands of the weed 's seeds covered the ground			1
he said : ' i was walking my dog by the river and , when i looked across , i could n't believe the sea of white in the field			1
' it was a brilliant and breathtaking sight			2
you could hardly see any grass			2
' after walking around the huge five hectare field , mr @entity9 stopped in the area that caught his eye to take photographs			1
he added : ' the field is huge and i walked for a while to find the area that had the most dandelions so i could capture the best moment			1
' there were around 500 dandelions per square metre and it was covering it all - it was an amazing sight			1
' ' there were around 500 dandelions per square metre and it was covering it all - it was an amazing sight , ' said mr @entity9 mr @entity9 said that the lack of wind and rain in the area has resulted in an abundance of dandelion seeds			1
he continued : ' there has n't been a lot of wind and rain in @entity16 in recent weeks so the dandelion seeds have n't blown away like they normally would			1
' the dandelion seeds are normally dispersed after being carried on the wind like tiny parachutes			1
dry and sunny for @entity73 ... but first , a few showers more wet weather is on the way but the @entity73 weekend looks set to be dry and sunny , forecasters say			2
after some heavy showers on friday most of the country will enjoy decent weather with temperatures reaching up to @entity82 ( @entity83 ) in the south - on par with @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
temperatures will be slightly cooler in the north and could dip to as low as @entity90 in some places			2
but @entity93 forecaster @entity92 said this should clear away by the weekend , adding : ' it will be nice pretty much everywhere			2
' she added : ' we 've got some cold , windy and wet weather to come over the next couple of days because of a low pressure system moving eastwards across the country			0
' thursday and friday temperatures will not be terribly high , only reaching between 11 and @entity103 , and a bit colder in some places			0
' but after that , saturday and sunday look pretty decent days for the @entity73 at the moment			0
' it will be dry in most places with some sunshine as well			0
' on saturday , temperatures will reach @entity112 ( @entity113 ) while we 'll see temperatures of @entity82 ( @entity83 ) on sunday in the south			0
it might still feel a little cool in the shade but should feel pretty warm in the sun. ' ms @entity92 said it wo n't top the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) - the warmest day of the year so far - we had on may 7 in @entity124 in @entity125 but will bring us back to average temperatures for this time of year			0
by monday , the nice weather will tail off in some parts with spells of rain , particularly in @entity131 and western @entity132			0
and forecasters warned anyone planning a trip in the mountains should expect potentially hazardous conditions			0
' @entity132 will be the worst - hit place so if anyone is walking in the mountains , they should be careful to prepare themselves as there is likely to be snow and high winds			0
' it will feel particularly cold , ' ms @entity145 added			0
dandelion seeds are carried on the wind like tiny parachutes on a breezy day , a dandelion seed can be blown miles from its parent plant			1
the parachute part of the seed drops off when it strikes an obstacle , which is why so many grow in crevices next to walls			0
