' you can see this in the debates around immigration , particularly …			0
patriotism is a great thing , but nationalism , especially of the narrow , partisan sort , always has real danger lurking underneath it … ' one of the attractions of what i would call a @entity141 model of leadership is that in an era where the political leaders [ are ] to be hesitant about big positions , you 've got somebody who is taking big positions			0
' now , i would not agree with those positions			0
but the attraction of that as a model , which is why a lot of these people like [ @entity153 ] le @entity154 and [ @entity156 ] @entity155 and people praise him , is that there appears to be certainty about the solution			0
it 's not a solution i would agree with			0
