@entity1 's leadership has come into question after a recent poll put the @entity4 ahead of @entity5 @entity1 ’s leadership was under fresh scrutiny last night after another poll showed the @entity4 ahead of @entity5			1
@entity8 , the former health secretary , was even being touted by some mps as an emergency replacement for mr @entity1 to avoid ‘ catastrophe ’ at the next election			1
the latest poll , carried out by former conservative treasurer @entity15 , deepened @entity5 turmoil by giving @entity18 ’s party a two point lead			1
last week the two parties were level pegging , but yesterday ’s survey found the @entity4 on 32 per cent and @entity5 on 30 per cent			1
the @entity23 were down at just 7 per cent			0
@entity24 was still riding high on 17 per cent – the same as last week			0
it indicates mr @entity18 ’s conference speech and the @entity4 ’ promise to scrap the @entity29 did not persuade many voters to return to the fold			1
worryingly for mr @entity1 , the poll indicates a collapse in the number of people who voted @entity23 in 2010 switching to @entity5			1
@entity5 had a 15 point lead over the @entity4 among @entity23 switchers in last week ’ s poll , but now the lead is just 4 per cent , indicating that mr @entity18 is managing to steal many former @entity23 away from mr @entity1			1
the @entity15 survey comes four days after another polling organisation , @entity41 , found the @entity42 had a 1 point lead			0
one former @entity5 frontbencher said last night that it looked increasingly likely that the party could lose seats at the next election			1
‘ @entity48 are tearing their hair out , ’ he said			0
‘ they are utterly despondent ; they think @entity1 ’s conference speech was terrible			1
‘ if it carries on like this , we face catastrophe next may			0
‘ increasing numbers of people from across the @entity56 want to see him go – not just people who did n’t support him four years ago , but increasingly people who did support him as well			0
’ polling shows more than half of @entity5 supporters prefer one of the other party leaders to @entity1 on five key issues including immigration , @entity68 , law and order and defence			1
@entity8 , the former health secretary , is being touted by some mps as an emergency replacement for mr @entity1 things have got so bad that some @entity5 backbenchers are calling on home secretary @entity76 to step up to the challenge and replace mr @entity1 as leader – although he has indicated he does not want the job			1
last night another mp said that mr @entity8 is increasingly being spoken of as someone who could restore the party ’s fortunes in the seven month run - up to the election			1
@entity5 ’s health spokesman received the best reaction at the party conference in @entity89 last month – a far cry from the response to mr @entity1 ’s poorly - received speech			1
‘ the only person who could do it reckon is @entity8 , ’ said the mp			2
‘ some of the other contenders like @entity96 and @entity97 are younger and they are more likely to wait until the election and then strike			0
‘ but @entity8 has the experience and the wherewithal to become leader before the election , should things fall that way			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity1 is the problem – just those two words			2
the party is disillusioned and the way things are going we will be doing well if we end up in coalition with the @entity113			0
’ a former minister said he would also like to see mr @entity8 take over – but said it was unlikely there would be a change before the election			2
a former @entity5 frontbencher believes @entity1 should stand down as he ' is n't the right person ' to lead the party into an election ‘ @entity1 is n’t the right person , but @entity5 is loyal to its leaders , ’ he said			1
‘ we should be a lot further ahead in the polls – and i think we would be if we had a different leader			2
‘ @entity8 would be better but perhaps he needs a bit more time			0
at the moment we ’ve got the leader we ’ve got			0
’ another mp said : ‘ our election result could be even worse than 2010 – it ’s not inconceivable			0
no one who is undecided is going to look at @entity18 ’s speech and @entity1 ’s speech and vote @entity5			1
‘ the @entity4 look and sound hungrier than us , their message clearer , their leader is more compelling			2
the best thing for @entity1 to do would be to stand down			1
’ but @entity140 , @entity5 mp for @entity141 , said he did not support a change in leader , saying the idea that it would change the party ’s fortunes was ‘ simplistic and naïve ’			2
he said : ‘ in order to win , there needs to be bigger dose of @entity151 realism			0
’ @entity41 president @entity152 said yesterday that mr @entity1 has ‘ more reasons than @entity18 to be apprehensive ’ about the coming months			0
he wrote in a blog post that @entity5 ’s core vote strategy may fail because its base is ‘ fragile and urgently needs strengthening ’			0
‘ there has been talk of him pursuing a core - vote strategy : seeking to hold on to a 35 per cent vote share at next year ’s election and hoping that this will be enough to make him prime minister , ’ said mr @entity152			0
‘ implicit in media discussions of the core - vote strategy is the assumption that these are all firm party loyalists , and that @entity1 ’s task is simply to mobilise them			2
the trouble is , they are n’t			0

latest poll puts @entity4 ahead of @entity5 - *spreading* disillusion among party
*ex-labour* frontbencher says many thought @entity1 's speech was ' terrible '
added that party would be *massively* ahead in polls with a different leader
