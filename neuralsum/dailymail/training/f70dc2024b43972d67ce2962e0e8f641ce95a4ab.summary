by @entity0 for @entity1 with its clear azure sea and lush palm trees , the town of @entity6 on @entity7 in @entity8 should be a gorgeous slice of tropical paradise			1
but as these incredible photos reveal , that could n't be further from the truth			0
once a thriving holiday destination , @entity6 was left virtually empty when , 20 years ago , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , three volcanoes on the edge of town , erupted - smothering the town in layers of volcanic ash and scalding lava			1
but despite the risk of further eruptions and the grim landscape , described by photographer @entity28 as ' @entity29 ' , some families , too poor to move , have been left to scratch a living in the rubble , while their children play in the scarred , otherworldly landscape left behind			2
bleak : a little boy sits on a hillock covered in grey ash and stunted grass just outside the ruined town of @entity6 in @entity8 's @entity7 dangerous : soft clouds of falling ash are a daily hazard for families living in the area , many of whom go on to develop respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer abandoned : for 10 - year - old @entity51 , the abandoned town is the perfect playground while , right , many of the apartment blocks are now derelict and visited only by animals beautiful : with its azure waters and golden beaches , @entity6 ought to be a tropical paradise but as this photo reveals , its three volcanoes have covered it in ash ' over 30,000 people left the town itself and a further 50,000 ran from the surrounding area , ' explains @entity28			1
' only four people lost their lives in the eruption , although one other was killed by a lighting strike on the southern flank of @entity16			1
' those who remain spend their days hunting for eggs laid two metres below the top layer of ash by the megapode bird or eking out a living by sweeping up ash or guarding the derelict remains of the town 's hotels			2
many lost their homes during the 1994 eruption and have moved into other , less damaged , properties although like everyone else who lives near the volcanoes , they run the risk of developing respiratory diseases and lung cancer as a result of the ash cloud			1
one man who knows only too well what the volcano can do is former deputy mayor , mr @entity97			0
his wife was one of those killed during the explosion and his son has moved to another town , so now he lives alone in his tiny house in the shadows of @entity15			2
devastating : former deputy mayor of @entity6 , mr @entity108 , lives alone in front of @entity15 , which he has done ever since his wife was killed in the 1994 eruption scratching a living : although @entity51 loves living in the volcanic wasteland , his father has to eke out a living as a security guard protecting abandoned hotels from looters dangerous job : megapode birds lay their eggs two metres below the surface of the volcanic sands and the locals make money by digging them up and selling them dirty job : getting to the megapode eggs requires hours of digging but once collected , the eggs can sell for up to 60p ( $ 1 ) each at market risky : like others working close to the three volcanoes , egg collectors risk a close encounter with scalding ash and also respiratory diseases and lung cancer tradition : locals who remain in the area have clung on to their traditions , among them the @entity142 which is performed wearing huge @entity144 masks dowry : to marry , locals pay a dowry in the form of shell money - 400 of these huge hoops are usually required , which involves collecting thousands of shells strange world : most of the people living in the area have homes in villages outside @entity6 and away from the volcanoes and the ash cloud , like this father and son fire dance : the @entity165 fire dance is performed by tribespeople living around the volcanoes and includes dancing over live coals to mimic the look of an eruption ' he has stopped buying cars because they stop working after two years thanks to the ash , ' adds @entity28			1
others still living in the ruins include 10 - year - old @entity51 , whose father works as a security guard for one of the ruined hotels			0
' he enjoys the place , ' says @entity28			0
' it 's like a giant playground for a child because there 's no cars to worry about and plenty of sand and dust to roll about in			0
' other children play on the wrecks of @entity194 era @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 tanks , which lie encased in ash among the rubble and date from the @entity196 occupation that began in january 1942			0
not long before that , the town had been rocked by yet another eruption that killed more than 500 people , although later planners chose to ignore the ominous rumblings from the volcanoes , even building an airport at the base of @entity16			1
' the airport was directly in the path of ash and lava from the nearby vents , ' explains @entity28 of the airfield , which now lies buried under tonnes of molten lava			0
' nobody knows why they built it at the foot of the volcano - it was a very strange thing to do , given the previous eruptions			0
' hidden : although the @entity226 were relatively untouched by the eruption , the catacombs , and the @entity196 landing craft within , have been abandoned barren : following the explosion in 1994 , ash and lava rained down on the town and surrounding area leaving a pock marked blasted wasteland behind bad idea : this pool of molten lava and volcanic ash is all that remains of @entity6 's airport which was built at the foot of @entity15 and was completely destroyed in 1994 explosive : since the 1994 eruption , the volcanoes have continued to emit huge clouds of ash which can be seen all over @entity7 barren : this area was once known as @entity250 but thanks to the 1994 eruption , all the fruit trees have been burned and nothing now grows also destroyed in the 1994 eruption were the townsfolk 's fruit trees , with one plantation - formerly known as @entity250 - now a wasteland of charred branches and solidified ash			1
nevertheless , some of the traditions do remain , among them the @entity165 dancers from the local @entity263 tribe , who wear giant masks that are never seen during the day and jump into the fire , kicking the ashes as they go			0
the @entity263 also retain their custom of charging a bride price payable in ' shell money ' , which is made from hundreds of delicately polished pieces of mother of pearl , and are the only remaining @entity8 to perform the ' @entity275 dance ' which they do wearing enormous @entity144 masks			0
but while the locals do their best to cling on to their traditions , few are still around to enjoy them and with another eruption expected in 2050 , that small number could soon be reduced to none			2
filthy job : the best paying job in @entity6 is that of street cleaner with regular sweeping required to keep the ash spewing from the volcanoes from smothering the town smothered : so thick is the ashy layer on homes , fields and businesses , it has caused 80 per cent of the buildings in the area to collapse under its weight buried : thanks to the 1942 @entity196 occupation , @entity6 is home to scores of old tanks , in this case an @entity198 one , which now lie buried beneath heaps of ash blighted : the only remaining hotel in @entity6 specialises in volcano views ( left ) while even the opposite side of the bay from @entity6 is blighted by the ash cloud ( right ) deadly : @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 last erupted in 1994 but have continued to emit ash clouds ever since and are scheduled to erupt again in 2050			1

the town of @entity6 in @entity8 sits beneath three *active* volcanoes : @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17
volcanoes last erupted in 1994 , smothering the town with lava and ash , and continue to emit ash clouds today
although the *majority* of *inhabitants* fled in 1994 , a *handful* still remain and scratch a living from egg collecting
because of the ash cloud , they are at risk of developing respiratory diseases and even lung cancer
previous eruption was in 1937 and killed 500 people and the next is expected to come in 2050
