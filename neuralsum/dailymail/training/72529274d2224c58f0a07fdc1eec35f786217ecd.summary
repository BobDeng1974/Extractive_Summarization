by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 20 june 2013 it sounds like a spell from @entity3 - but the @entity4 is in fact taking retro photography to a new level			1
the tiny replica of a slide projector beams a wheel of nine @entity12 images onto a nearby wall , using wheels of 35mm slide film made online			1
the device was created by a @entity18 firm which successfully raised more than £ 55,000 during a @entity20 campaign last december			1
and now the pocket - sized , battery - powered projectors are available to buy			1
it is powered by batteries , which last up to eight hours , and costs £ 22 go to @entity30 and click get started			0
sign in using your @entity12 account details and choose nine photos			0
once signed in your @entity12 account will be connected to your @entity4 account			2
pay £ 5.75 ( $ 8.99 ) and the company will print your wheel of photos and post them to you			0
put the wheel into the projector , press the red button to switch on the leds and point the projector at any vertical surface			2
the makers claim that it works best in the dark but can be used during daylight			0
the batteries will last for eight hours			0
the @entity4 project was inspired after product designer @entity52 came across an old projector in a @entity54			1
mr @entity52 , from @entity18 - based digital design agency , @entity55 , said : ' on taking it apart , i saw that the mechanics could be miniaturised and thought @entity12 would bring the warmth to how we take photos now			1
' @entity4 is a tiny @entity12 projector that uses wheels of 35mm slide film that can be made online			1
each wheel holds nine photos and because slide film does n't have pixels the tiny images wo n't appear pixelated or blurry when projected to a large wall			1
the images will shine up to 2.5 - feet wide			0
to get the images onto the strip of film , they are are ' melted ' on to a single frame of @entity78 film , which is then processed in a similar way to how analogue films are developed , except in full colour			0
the projector is a fully working system that uses pictures printed onto @entity78 film instead of traditional slides			1
this means when the tiny images are beamed up to 2.5 - feet wide on a wall they do n't become pixelated inside the projector is a single led light which projects the image when focused			2
it is powered by batteries which can be replaced this is similar to how @entity97 film makers convert digital movies to 35mm film to project in cinemas			1
' whether they 're of your best friends , that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats , just pop them into @entity107 , focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow , ' claimed the @entity20 campaign			2
@entity52 added : ' i was enthralled by the warmth of the images it projected			0
there 's no digital image that can match it			2
' we started off by @entity119 early prototypes of @entity4			2
this image shows how the @entity4 measures up to a normal film projector			1
the mechanisms inside are exactly the same but @entity55 scaled them down to make the @entity4 more portable sure , it was rough and stuck together with tape but it had enough charm to make us fall in love with the idea			2
we wanted to see how far we could take it			0
' through an iterative process we optimised the focal length of the lenses and added a focusing mechanism			0
' we looked for the most powerful leds we could find , made the batteries replaceable and figured out the perfect ratio of images per wheel			0
the @entity12 images are first chosen via the @entity143 website , which send the order to @entity55			0
the company ' melts ' the photos onto 35mm film , pictured , and fits the film to a slide carousel wheel that costs £ 5.75 ( $ 8.99 ) we modified the outside edges to give @entity4 a five degree chamfer , to make it a bit nicer to hold			1
oh and of course , we gave it cute little feet			0
@entity52 built the projectors with a @entity158 product development consultancy called @entity159			0
the @entity4 projector costs £ 22 ( $ 34.99 ) and the wheels are £ 5.74 ( $ 8.99 ) each			1
the films are developed and sent out from @entity163 and shipping for outside the @entity165 is a minimum of £ 3 ( $ 5 )			0
the pictures are printed on @entity78 film , with each frame being a mini slide carousel each carousel is then cut and placed in a special tiny holder which is placed in the projector			1

the @entity4 's design is based on slide carousel projectors
9 digital photos can be printed onto 35mm film and beamed onto any surface
the projector reached its *funding* target on the website @entity20 in less than *24* hours last december and is finally available to buy
