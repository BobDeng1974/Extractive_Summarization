@entity1 forward @entity0 produced an outrageous piece of skill to break the deadlock in the @entity1 's clash with @entity6 , only to see the linesman 's flag rule his effort out			1
the flag had already gone up before the @entity11 had even begun his pivot , but fans were still wowed as @entity0 defied logic to find then net from the tightest of angles			0
the 27 - year - old was enduring a frustrating night after being very isolated up front , especially after the dismissal of @entity20 , but he showed his class , even if it was all meaningless			2
@entity0 races through and rounds the ' keeper as the linesman 's flag is raised for offside as the ball reaches the byline , he turns and uses the outside of his boot to spin the ball back towards goal @entity0 looks on as his audacious effort spins back towards the line , now aware he has been flagged offside the ball heads away from goal before spinning back due to the slice @entity0 put on his effort it just creeps over the line to complete the skill , but the offside flag meant it counted for nothing @entity0 , who moved to @entity1 in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements at @entity45 , showed the @entity46 what he could do in september , with an astounding back - heeled goal against @entity49 in a thrilling 5 - 4 victory			1
with eight goals already , @entity0 has enjoyed a new lease of life after falling out of favour in the @entity11 capital			0
and fans will be hoping that with such a repertoire of skills , @entity0 can help the fallen giant get back to challenging at the summit of @entity62 football .			0

@entity0 *flicked* the ball as he reached the byline after racing through
the *incredible* goal was in vain , as he *'d* already been flagged offside
@entity1 held out for a 0 - 0 draw despite having @entity20 sent - off
as a *result* , @entity1 missed the *opportunity* to move into the @entity75 top three
