@entity0 , the controversial retailer known for its sexually suggestive advertising strategy , is looking to alter its risqué image by debuting a ' pro-women ' ad campaign featuring its female staffers			1
the first print ad , which shows images of various female @entity0 employees , who are identified by their first names and their start date at the company in small print below their pictures , has the words ' @entity13 ' emblazoned across the page and appeared in the latest issue of @entity17			1
' women have always been in charge at @entity0 , ' the ad reads			2
‘ in fact , women make up 55per cent of our global workforce ( sorry , guys ) and an even higher percentage of our leadership and executive roles			0
this structure is incredibly ( and unfortunately ) rare in the corporate world			0
' major rebranding : controversial retailer @entity0 debuted a new ' pro-women ' ad campaign featuring this image of three female employees from the company new message : the brand also shared images from the campaign on its @entity41 account for @entity42 the images featured in the ad were also posted on the company 's @entity41 account last month in celebration of @entity42 with more than 16,000 people liking the photo collage			1
@entity0 confirmed to @entity50 that the ad only has thus far only appeared in @entity17 , and the outlet noted that it was an interesting choice for the company to make because the magazine ' is n’t exactly known as female friendly '			1
' we have had a great relationship with @entity17 for years and plan on continuing to work closely with them on future campaigns and partnerships , ' @entity0 's senior vice president of marketing @entity57 told @entity50 smiling faces : according to the ad , 55per cent of @entity0 's staffers are women work appropriate : these female employees were photographed wearing modest button - down shirts , which is a far cry from the brand 's more sexually explicit ads but @entity50 went on to add that it was ' likely not a coincidence ' that the ad ran in first issue helmed by @entity17 's new female editor - in - chief @entity76			1
before the @entity81 - based company 's founder and former ceo @entity82 was ousted in december following a string of sexual harassment lawsuits , the retailer had a history of using boundary - pushing , sexually provocative ads featuring fresh - faced girls to sell its clothing			1
now that @entity82 has since been replaced by @entity91 , the images have been significantly toned down as the brand rethinks its previous marketing strategy			2
new attitude : the company , which has a history of using sexually proactive ads like this one , is rethinking its marketing strategy under the helm of the @entity0 's new ceo @entity91 @entity0 has also started airbrushing out pubic hair and nipples from lingerie models in attempt to make the brand ' less pornographic '			2
but controversy continues to follow the company			0
the brand came under fire again after a leaked email written on march 18 by casting agent @entity110 said the company would be hiring real models not ' @entity113 ' or ' @entity114 ' , which is an acronym meaning ' that ho over there '			0
both @entity0 and @entity110 publicly apologized for the email , and the brand posted an image of ' curvier models ' to its @entity121 page as a means of proving the sentiment in the email did not reflect the company ’s general ethos , writing : ' this is @entity0 , always has been and always will be			0
we love all of our models , all shapes and sizes			0
