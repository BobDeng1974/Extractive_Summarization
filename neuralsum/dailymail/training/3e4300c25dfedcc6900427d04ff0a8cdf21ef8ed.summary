got it wrong : the @entity1 was criticised over inaccurate forecasts ahead of the @entity3 in the winter of 2010 , pictured , but now claim it is better at predicting cold snaps this ‘ high top ’ system includes weather patterns called sudden stratospheric warmings – @entity19 – which block warm air flowing across the @entity21 to @entity22 and cause temperatures to plunge			1
it was found in a study by @entity1 climate experts to perform better than the model used at the time and would have predicted the weather chaos with more certainty			1
when the new system was used the following winter , it was able to predict freezing temperatures two months in advance , it said			2
forecasters insist they did warn about low temperatures in 2009 - 10 when the coldest winter for a century saw @entity39 blanketed in snow and the mercury plunge to minus @entity42 ( @entity43 )			2
they installed the new model in late 2010 , and tested it retrospectively for predicting weather from the previous october to february in a study published in @entity47			0
co-author @entity48 said by october 2010 the high top version of their computing system – named @entity54 – was ‘ indicating an increased chance of a cold start to winter ’			0
better model : forecasters have developed a computer program that can track changes high in the atmosphere , thought to be key to extreme cold spells he said : ‘ that year december was the second coldest in 350 years			1
it also highlighted the possibility that conditions in late winter were likely to be less harsh , which was indeed the case			0
‘ in 2011 , @entity54 predicted that a mild , westerly winter was likely			0
this turned out to be the case – only the first two weeks of february 2012 were cold			1
’ ninety - day forecasts for the public were ditched in 2009 after a predicted ‘ barbecue summer ’ turned out to be a washout			0
the public can see a 30 - day forecast and seasonal forecasts are only given to government and businesses			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity79 said : ‘ the public have said they do n’t find three - monthly outlooks useful because they are not the kind of thing you can plan a day trip out on			2
’ the @entity87 yesterday said the hottest temperature ever recorded – @entity89 ( @entity90 ) at @entity91 in @entity92 90 years ago – was incorrect			0
the record is now held by @entity94 in @entity95 at @entity96 ( 134 ° f ) on july 10 , 1913 .			0
