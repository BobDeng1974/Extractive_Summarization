by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 12:28 est , 11 december 2012 a quarter of parents now regard heating up baked beans or putting a frozen pizza in the oven as ‘ cooking ’ , according to a new study			2
the researchers concluded that @entity10 people are in danger of losing their cooking skills as more of us rely on ready meals			2
another finding was that traditional @entity10 dishes such as @entity17 and steak and kidney pie are in danger of dying out			1
culinary masterpiece : a quarter of @entity10 's parents would regard this as a cooking triumph , the study says the survey of 2,000 adults found that fewer @entity10 people than ever are cooking properly every night of the week , with just 19 per cent of us doing it , compared to nearly 40 per cent 20 years ago			1
researchers found that one in five @entity10 parents also believe heating a ready meal in the microwave constitutes cooking , and nine per cent of mothers and fathers have tried to pass off microwave meals as their own work			1
and 27 per cent - or 3.6 million - say shoving a pizza or chicken nuggets and chips in the oven counts as ‘ cooking ’			0
the poll , commissioned by the cookery book publisher @entity49 , also found that as our lives become increasingly hectic , we spend less time in the kitchen than we did 20 years ago			0
just a third of us can claim we spend more than 40 minutes cooking a meal - compared to 50 per cent of the previous generation			1
as we spend less time cooking , so we are forgetting how to cook traditional favourites			1
the survey showed that only ten per cent of us have made a @entity17 in the last five years , and just one in five of us have made a steak and kidney pie from scratch in that time			1
do you know how to make one ? only ten per cent of us have made a @entity17 in the last five years the descent of @entity65 ’ culinary skills contrasts sharply with the rise in popularity of cookery programmes and celebrity chefs			1
more and more of us are relying on frozen food and ready meals - which we munch while watching cookery programmes on television			0
but we 're not learning from them : the average @entity75 learns five recipes from a cookbook in comparison to just two from a food show			0
the speedy choice : more of us are turning to ready meals as our lives become busier the research showed that just a quarter of us are likely to try a recipe we ’ve seen on television as we find them too complicated and too fast to follow			0
@entity87 , a 46 - year - old admin worker and mother - of - three from @entity89 , said : ' we ’ve certainly had more pre-prepared meals since having kids			0
' when my husband and i get back from work the last thing we want to do is spend an hour in the kitchen cooking - on a busy day it 's so much quicker and easier to heat up a ready - made lasagne in the microwave than make it from scratch			0
' new family tradition : more families are eating ready meals heated in the microwave @entity106 , of @entity107 , which produces the @entity109 range of cookbooks , said : ' brits have less time to cook but still want to eat and provide good food			2
' despite millions of us tuning in to cookery shows , a cookbook still seems the easiest way for people to improve their culinary skills as they can go at their own pace , choose recipes to suit their tastes and enjoy the experience of cooking			0

only a third of @entity10 parents spend more than 40 minutes preparing food
just 19 per cent of us cook properly every night , while old favourites like @entity17 are dying out
