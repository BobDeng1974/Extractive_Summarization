@entity0 will target a marquee signing this summer so his @entity3 side are taken seriously next season			1
@entity0 has transformed @entity3 into relegation candidates to a club pushing for a top - half finish since taking charge in january			1
he will be active in the transfer market come the end of the season in an attempt to take the club to the next level and is keen to bring in a big name to declare the club ’s intentions			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 is keen on bringing in a star name to boost the club 's profile @entity3 boss @entity0 slapped a ' 40 to 60 million pounds ' price - tag on @entity3 winger @entity20 ‘ that is a solution to not just give us a better media standing than we have , but to also give everybody else here the recognition in terms of their value that we could attract a player of that type , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ that is something i have thought about			2
’ @entity0 is prepared to let star winger @entity20 leave for ‘ between 40 and 60 million pounds ’ and would use the money to build a formidable squad			1
but even if that does not happen , @entity0 , whose side host relegation strugglers @entity36 on saturday , is adamant that he will be backed by chairman @entity38			2
the former @entity40 boss was able to make five permanent signings in january and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens			2
@entity0 added : ’ to be honest , the chairman is as much banging on my door as i am his			2
the most important thing is we get good value			0
’ while @entity3 may seek to break the £ 7million club transfer record set with the september 2014 arrival of @entity50 from @entity51 , @entity0 is loath to do so lightly			1
@entity3 broke their club transfer record in september 2014 when they splashed out £ 7m on @entity50 ' it is n't just about the money and is n't just about the figure that you pay , ' said @entity0			1
' it really is about are they better than what you have			0
' therefore what is their value ? and that is what you have to gauge			0
' i have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in			2
i think in that window just passed we bought really well , but really we have n't seen them			0
' i have n't had to lean on @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity78 ( @entity77 ) too much really			0
' and i really did think , particularly in @entity79 , that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close			0
' in a way the team have taken that equation away			0
' @entity0 has guided @entity3 out of the relegation mire since his january arrival , with the @entity3 fifth in the @entity90 standings on 2015 's fixtures alone			1
victory over @entity36 in saturday 's @entity95 clash would rubber - stamp @entity3 's top - flight safety , and @entity0 admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind			1
' there could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what i am going to do between now and the end of the year , ' he said			0
' i will try and keep our professionalism together , but also look at @entity78 and @entity76 and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment			0
' we still have some big games though , so i have to look at that and ca n't be experimenting in some			0
' it is about making sure whatever team goes out there is every bit as good as the team that has played in the last few weeks			0
' @entity0 has not had to ' lean on ' @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - yong since their arrival			1

@entity0 believes high - profile signing will send out *statement* of intent
the @entity3 manager is keen on bringing the club to next level
@entity0 has *warned* *potential* *suitors* off of star winger @entity20
