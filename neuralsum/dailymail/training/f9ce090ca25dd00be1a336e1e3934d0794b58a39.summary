by @entity0 should @entity1 drop @entity2 ? after that performance on sunday , it is time for @entity1 to stop considering @entity2 their first - choice centre - back			1
they need to look to the future , assuming everybody is fit			0
he was at fault for @entity12 ’s late equaliser when he should have headed the ball away and it must be better to play the younger players now			0
once you know you are leaving a club , it is normal for your level to drop			0
i ’ve played with people who knew they were leaving a club and it was clear that they had one eye on the future			0
turn your back ? it 's time @entity1 stopped considering @entity2 as their first - choice centre - back you see that in @entity2 ’s performances — is he giving his all or worried about getting injured ? he is certainly making too many mistakes and @entity34 and @entity35 deserve a chance to prove themselves			1
i ’m not convinced they or @entity39 are a long - term solution for @entity1 but they must be given the opportunity			1
sir @entity43 @entity43 said @entity34 could be a @entity1 great but we need to find out now whether that is true			1
potential : @entity34 or @entity35 ( above ) may be best suited to replacing @entity2 in the long - term no @entity47 goal a great sign i ca n’t remember a better all - round performance from @entity50 in recent years			1
early goals give teams confidence and @entity50 pressed and harried @entity54 brilliantly			2
they did n’t give @entity57 ’s side a second on the ball			0
but what will be most pleasing for @entity61 was that his side won without @entity47 scoring			1
things can get even better : with @entity65 and @entity66 getting in on the act , @entity50 can improve further in fact , it was the first time since march 2013 that they have won in the @entity72 when @entity47 played , but did n’t score			1
with @entity65 and @entity66 taking some of that burden off the @entity74 , @entity50 can only get better			2
turn up : saturday was the first time @entity50 won where @entity47 played but did n't score since march 2013 time to banish muddy pitches i think i speak on behalf of every parent by saying it is time to introduce more artificial pitches in this country			1
for the past few weeks , kids playing football and rugby have had their games cancelled because grass pitches can not handle the rain			0
i remember going to @entity89 v @entity88 a few years back and criticising the artificial pitch , but the technology has come on in leaps and bounds			0
the @entity94 and @entity95 pitches on offer are excellent and we need more			0
it ’s what they have in @entity101 and @entity102 and we need the same facilities if we want to develop our young players			0
time for change : @entity89 's artificial pitch was criticised in 2007 , but it 's time to bring them into the game more hazard v @entity110 picking a @entity111 this season is going to be very hard			1
@entity113 was the star in the opening few games , then @entity47 stole all the headlines and now @entity116 looks unstoppable			1
his hat - trick performance against @entity118 was sensational — he is thriving in a more central role this season			0
@entity120 is amazed that the @entity121 has n’t won any monthly awards			2
maybe he will end the season with a bigger accolade than that			0
@entity47 has his nose in front right now but we ’ve not reached the business end of the season yet			2
it ’s all to play for			0
triple threat : @entity116 scored his first hat - trick for @entity132 to send the club top of the @entity72 candidate : @entity113 was the star in the opening months of the season and was tipped for the award quit the mind games , @entity139 @entity140 looked like a ghost on his @entity143 interview on saturday night			1
@entity120 is winning the mind games with the @entity146 manager			1
@entity140 is rising to every @entity120 comment , sniping back at the @entity132 manager ’s claims that the @entity151 side are a ‘ little horse ’			1
everyone knows that @entity120 is talking nonsense , claiming that his side are n’t in the title race , but @entity140 does n’t need to respond to that — let everyone else pick him up on it			1
do n't let him catch you out : city boss @entity140 needs to stop rising to @entity120 's comments @entity120 must find it hilarious			1
the @entity163 ’s reaction reminds me of the way @entity166 got wound up by sir @entity43 when the @entity167 was at @entity50			2
there is only one winner			0
@entity140 should be more concerned with his own team right now and the fact they have n’t scored in the past two games			2
of course they miss @entity175 , but the absence of @entity177 is just as telling			0
playing against @entity178 is one thing , facing @entity178 and @entity177 is another and @entity140 will be desperate to see the return of the @entity181			2
the mastermind : @entity120 is winning the mind games with the @entity146 boss hands down all over : @entity186 's touch map shows his influence for @entity188 against @entity189 @entity190 one @entity188 of a signing @entity193 selling @entity186 to @entity188 was the transfer that surprised me most in january			1
he is a good forward who works hard and scores goals			0
his two goals in two games for @entity200 ’s men will have not gone unnoticed at the @entity201			0
@entity188 were looking a bit shaky , but the win at @entity189 should give them confidence again			0
@entity186 and @entity205 will score goals and @entity200 playing three at the back means they can , crucially , still play three in midfield			0
@entity210 is having a fantastic season but is not at his best in a midfield two and @entity200 knows that			0
@entity214 safe with @entity215 i 've rarely seen a young manager look as cool , calm and collected as @entity218			1
you saw from the way that @entity221 ran into his arms during the 3 - 0 win over @entity224 that @entity214 ’s players want to play for him			2
@entity227 and @entity61 have shown that @entity214 is a great learning ground for young managers and @entity215 has the chance to be just as successful			1
learning : @entity218 was the hero in south @entity231 on saturday after @entity214 's 3 - 0 win over bitter rivals @entity224 the only place @entity215 ’s inexperience showed was when i spoke to him after the game on our @entity238 show			1
he said he replaced @entity240 with @entity241 because @entity240 was injured			0
next time , just let everyone carry on thinking it was a tactical masterstroke ! @entity0 's @entity72 @entity244 14 - @entity116 became the 14th player to score a hat - trick for @entity132 in the @entity72 after : @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			1
36 - @entity193 's debutant @entity260 was on the pitch just 36 seconds before scoring			2
but that is only the second fastest goal by a substitute this season ; @entity267 ’s @entity266 scored 27 seconds after coming on against @entity188			0
clinical : @entity269 scored with their only two shots on target at @entity272 , both through @entity273 2 - @entity269 scored with their only two shots on target in the 2 - 0 victory against @entity277			0
their opponents also managed only one shot on target in the whole match			0
1995 - @entity214 's 3 - 0 drubbing of rivals @entity224 on saturday was their biggest derby win in the league since march 1995 , when they won 4 - 1 in the third tier			1
4 - @entity287 netted his fourth @entity72 goal direct from a free - kick — since @entity290 were promoted in 2012 only @entity47 , with five , has scored more			1
finishing touch : @entity292 has been in clinical form this season , scoring 60 per cent of his shots on target 60 per cent - six of @entity292 ’s 10 shots on target have found the back of the net in the @entity72 this season			1
4 - @entity301 left , @entity302 have won all four league games in which @entity292 has scored			2
3 - only three teams have scored four goals quicker than @entity50 ’s 20 - minute mauling of @entity54			2
in 1998 @entity307 hit four past @entity308 in 15 minutes , in 2003 @entity54 struck four in 19 minutes against @entity146 and that was matched by @entity1 against @entity12 in 2006 .			0

it 's time @entity1 stopped considering @entity2 as their first - choice centre - back
saturday was the first time @entity50 have won in the @entity72 when @entity47 played without scoring since march 2013
@entity116 , @entity47 or @entity113 ? this term 's @entity111 is a tough choice
@entity140 is losing the mind games against @entity120
@entity214 is a great learning ground for managers , and @entity218 has showed potential already
