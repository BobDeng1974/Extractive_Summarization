@entity0 said she felt ' cursed ' at @entity1 after losing in straight - sets to a resurgent @entity3 in the @entity5 second round on thursday			1
the eighth - seeded @entity6 enjoyed making the semi-finals in 2011 but has since suffered diminishing returns in every trip to the year 's first grand slam			1
she could certainly count herself unlucky to run into fellow former world number one @entity3 so early at @entity1 , the @entity17 floating like a mine in the draw , with no seeding and nothing to lose after an injury - blighted 2014			1
@entity0 speaks to the press after losing to @entity3 in straight sets on thursday @entity0 afterwards spoke of a curse she feels is over her after four bad years at the @entity5 ' obviously she feels great here , ' @entity0 told reporters of two - time champion @entity3 , who was a class above in the 6 - 4 6 - 2 win at @entity26			1
' i think it 's a curse i 've gotten here			1
i 've made semis , then quarters ( 2012 ) , then fourth round ( 2013 ) , then third round ( 2014 ) , this year second round			1
' it 's kind of gone that way the last few years			2
hopefully i 'm going to break that next year and start going the other way			1
' i love this tournament and i 'm so sad to be out already			2
obviously it was a tough draw for both of us			0
but , you know , she came out on top and played better			0
' @entity3 pumps her fist after winning a point against @entity0 in @entity1 on thursday @entity3 danced off court in celebration ( left ) after winning her second round match against @entity0 @entity0 had worked hard to break back into the top 10 last year , reaching the final at the @entity48 and raising hopes she might be able to compete with the likes of @entity51 and @entity52 after a couple of years in the wilderness			1
instead , @entity55 gave her a crushing reality check and produced a familiar complaint that she had let herself be dominated by a hard - hitting opponent			2
' in general , i think i did okay			0
but at the same time i felt like i let her dictate a little bit too much , ' she said			0
' she played cross-court , i played cross-court back			0
i should have opened it up a little bit earlier and just tried to make her play my game			0
' a loss is a loss			0
it does n't feel fun to be here right now			0
' i would rather completely suck and play terrible and win than play wonderfully and lose			0
' ' but it definitely feels much harder to lose this early as well			2

@entity0 lost 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 to @entity3 in @entity1
the result means she *crashed* out of the @entity5 in round two
@entity0 says she feels like she is cursed at the tournament after poor *performances* in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 as well
she hopes to break the curse next year to go further in the competition
