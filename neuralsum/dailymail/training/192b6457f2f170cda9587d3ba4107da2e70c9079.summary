in a remarkable interview a @entity1 defector has revealed details about assassination attempts on the country ’s former leader and plots to overthrow him that help explain the dangerous paranoia that engulfs his son 's regime			1
what makes the revelations so extraordinary is that they ’ve come from a highly credible source – a former intelligence officer now living in @entity18			0
plots to kill @entity22 ’s father , @entity21 , who ruled @entity1 from 1994 to december 2011 , have involved a lone gunman , a 20 - tonne truck and even missile strikes , he said			1
another attempt came a bit closer to succeeding			0
mr @entity43 said that @entity21 ’s motorcade was rammed by a 20 - tonne lorry , but the driver was fooled by @entity21 ’s tactic of deploying decoy cars and he struck the wrong limousine			1
mr @entity35 also revealed details about two attempted coups			1
both were plotted by members of the @entity54 that had been trained at @entity57 ’s @entity56 military academy and established strong links with @entity59 , according to @entity60			0
both involved officers taking full advantage of military equipment at their disposal			2
one group of officers wanted to blow up the @entity59 consulate in the city of @entity69 in the hope that the attack would prompt military action against @entity1 by @entity59			2
father and son : @entity21 and @entity22 watch from a podium as soldiers march in a parade celebrating the 65th anniversary of the ruling @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity1 , in 2010 another was even more audacious - multiple missile strikes on @entity80			1
both plots were uncovered before they had a chance of being put into action			0
the @entity1 regime is so secretive that it ’s extremely difficult to verify mr @entity35 ’s revelations			1
however , two incidents do back - up his claims			0
in 1994 officers that had studied in @entity59 were arrested in what was known as the ‘ @entity94 ’ and in 1997 a firefight erupted at the headquarters of the @entity54 ’s @entity97 when soldiers stormed it to make arrests			0
the latter incident has never been fully explained			0
mr @entity35 , who defected in 2005 , went on to describe in his briefing to journalists the extraordinary paranoia of @entity22			1
he said that even family members are patted down before meeting the dictator , who is constantly surrounded by multiple tiers of security , including bodyguards and regular police			1
he also described how the country ’s notorious gulags were run by a sinister organisation called @entity114			0
once you check in to a gulag , he said , ‘ you do not check out ’			0
even dead bodies remain there , he added			0
it has been reported that @entity22 is planning one of his ' purges ' to rid @entity1 of one of the country 's most powerful figures , after the country 's records reveal that they , not the son of @entity21 , might be the rightful heir to the communist state			1
watchful : @entity22 pictured during an inspection of @entity133 units in 2013 two hundred figures in @entity80 are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of @entity1 , because of their loyalty to his uncle , @entity138 , who was executed late last year			1
but @entity140 , currently joint chairman of the powerful @entity141 and political director of the @entity143 has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership			0
new evidence from the 1930s show that it might have been the father of @entity22 's uncle who led the attack against the @entity151 , and that this attack was later claimed by @entity21 's grandfather so they could be the ruling family			1
the attack was a turning point for @entity1 , and helped them to claim a part of the @entity160 back from @entity151 occupation			0
the grandfather of @entity22 , @entity163 , is documented in @entity1 's official history as the leader of the 1937 attack on the @entity151 base defending the town of @entity169 , which helped him gain a foothold of legitimacy in the claim of leadership of the country			2
these reports that @entity1 is looking to change it 's history again are not the first incidence of such an occurrence			2
@entity1 regularly changes its own country 's history , with children in the @entity1 being taught that the @entity181 was started in 1950 by an invasion by the @entity18 , and that @entity21 was born in a cabin on the slopes of @entity185 , when historians claim that the late leader was actually born in a refugee camp in the @entity189 .			2

@entity1 defector ' mr k ' revealed details of assassination plots
he described how a 20 - tonne truck rammed @entity21 's motorcade
another plot involved a lone gunman attacking @entity21 with a machine gun
mr @entity35 said army officers planned a missile strike against @entity80
@entity22 's security is so tight that even family members are patted down
