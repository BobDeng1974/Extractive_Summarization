@entity0 announced monday he wo n't be running for president in 2016 , while both @entity2 and @entity3 continued to inch closer to throwing their hats into the ring			1
@entity0 , a nine - term @entity7 congressman and the @entity9 's last vice presidential nominee on @entity2 's ticket , thanked those who encouraged him to seek the presidency , but said he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the @entity16			1
' after giving it a lot of thought , i ’ve decided not to run for president , ' @entity0 said in a press release			2
' our work at the @entity16 over the next few years will be crucial to moving @entity25 forward , and my job as chairman deserves undivided attention			1
he 's out : @entity0 , the @entity9 's last vice presidential nominee , announced he wo n't be running for president in 2016 the @entity7 congressman stated he wanted to focus all of his attention on his new role as chairman of the @entity16 ' it ’s clear our country needs a change in direction			1
and our party has a responsibility to offer a real alternative			0
so i ’m going to do what i can to lay out conservative solutions and to help our nominee lead us to victory			0
@entity0 was among those @entity2 , his running mate in 2012 , personally telephoned over the weekend to gauge their support for a third campaign			1
@entity2 's possible 2016 campaign was barely on the horizon at this time last week and would be the first return engagement of a losing major party nominee in decades			2
' it is no secret that i have always thought @entity2 would make a great president , ' he told @entity56			2
' as for his plans for 2016 , i do n't know what he is ultimately going to do and the last thing i want to do is get ahead of his own decision making process			0
' asked by @entity61 monday if he would back another @entity2 bid for the @entity63 , @entity0 , 44 , demurred , saying , ' it 's premature for any of that			1
' the former @entity67 governor shocked former staff , supporters and donors on friday when he told a private gathering in @entity72 that he is again seriously exploring a campaign , a change for @entity2 after several months of insisting his career in politics had comes to its end			1
the next day , he and his wife , @entity79 , began reaching out to others as members of their inner circle started to revive a political operation that had begun to move on			1
' we had a great conversation			0
he made it clear to me he is seriously considering the race , ' said @entity90 , a top @entity2 staffer in @entity91 during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns			2
' when you get a phone call like that at close to 9 on a saturday night , it means something			0
' calls from @entity2 also went to several boldface names in @entity9 politics , including @entity0 ; former house speaker @entity101 ; @entity91 sen. @entity102 and the state 's former governor , @entity105 ; former @entity107 gov. @entity106 , who ran for president in 2012 ; @entity109 , chief executive at @entity110 ; @entity112 rep. @entity111 ; two former senators , @entity114 of @entity67 and @entity115 of @entity116 ; and @entity117 , @entity2 's senior @entity119 strategist in both of his previous campaigns			1
third time 's the charm ? @entity2 is reaching out to former staff and supporters as he considers a third run for president			2
@entity2 and his wife , @entity79 , phoned former backers in the early voting states over the weekend @entity130 : asked if he would back another @entity2 bid for the @entity63 , his former running mate @entity0 said it was too early to tell said former @entity91 volunteer @entity134 , who backed @entity2 's first two bids , ' all we 're really waiting for is somebody to pull the trigger and say , " we 're in			1
" ' former aides suggested monday that @entity2 could easily become a force in the coming contest , pointing to the more than $ 1billion he raised and 60 million votes he garnered in the last election			2
yet he would face far greater challenges in the next presidential contest than he did in the last , particularly in the early primaries against a crowded field expected to feature more than a dozen @entity9 with legitimate @entity63 resumes , including several sitting governors and @entity25 senators			2
none threatens @entity2 's prospects more than former @entity152 governor @entity151 , an early establishment favorite who has already begun to draw from the same pool of @entity9 donors who fueled @entity2 's last campaign			1
@entity151 has yet to formally launch a campaign , but has been among the most aggressive would - be candidates in recent weeks , having launched a fundraising operation and attended a series of private meetings with donors across the country			0
@entity2 could also face another establishment favorite , @entity166 governor @entity3 , who is sending new signals that an announcement about his presidential plans could be imminent			1
the @entity172 's top fundraiser , @entity174 - based @entity173 , is preparing to join @entity3 's team			2
he told the @entity61 monday , ' i wo n't be the national finance chairman at the end of the week			0
' crowded field : @entity2 could face former @entity152 governor @entity151 ( left ) and @entity166 governor @entity3 ( right ) , who is sending new signals that an announcement about his plans could be imminent he declined to comment further because @entity3 has yet to announce his 2016 intentions			1
@entity173 was a leading fundraiser for @entity151 's brother , former president @entity184			0
@entity3 's team is expected to start making moves to raise money for a prospective presidential campaign by the end of the month , according to a person who has been in touch with @entity3 's team , but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly			1
that could include the potential formation of a political action committee to begin raising cash that can be used to support a prospective campaign , the person said			0
@entity3 's chief political adviser , @entity203 , declined to comment			0
meanwhile , a handful of other prospective presidential contenders were preparing monday to appear later this week at the @entity172 's winter meeting in @entity207			0

the summit will take place close to @entity2 's southern @entity216 home			0
a spokesman did not immediately respond when asked if @entity2 or his representatives would attend the meeting			0
in @entity91 on monday , former three - term @entity72 governor @entity220 capped a two - day trip to the early voting state sounding very much like a politician ready to jump into the race			1
he told the @entity61 in an interview he 's again considering a @entity63 campaign because the nation ca n't risk electing another @entity229 president			0
' that 's one of the reasons i think the outcome of this election is so important , and i 'm so much more inclined to get involved , ' @entity220 said .			0
