model @entity0 has hit out against the fashion industry ’s ' ridiculous ' treatment of sizing – and claims that she will no longer try and conform to society ’s stereotypes			1
the 27 - year - old , who is a size 10 , made headlines in november when she was chosen as the newest face of @entity14 ’s @entity13 underwear and was described in an interview with @entity16 as the first ' plus size ' model to have ever worked with the brand – a label which caused outrage among critics who claimed @entity0 was ' too thin ' to fit the larger stereotype			1
but now , the model has hit back at her critics , claiming that the fashion industry places too much emphasis on ' ridiculous ' labels for women according to their size			1
plus size , straight size , in - betweenies			1
it all sounds so ridiculous , ' she said in a new interview with @entity16			1
' i want all women to know , regardless of size , shape , color , whatever , that they are powerful beings			2
you own your beauty ; your body is what you make of it			0
you can , and should , celebrate it , regardless of whatever size society tells you it 's supposed to be			2
' she added : ' when i stopped the weird diets and essentially rejected what everyone was telling me to do with my body and my life , my whole world changed			0
i began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me			0
' i became a whole person again , which made it easier to figure out what i wanted from life and take on the challenges involved in getting there			0
i am more than a measurement and i want people to know that			0
' @entity81 confidence : ' i began to respect myself in a different way and to demand that same respect from the people around me , ' she added controversy : @entity0 's description as ' plus size ' in an interview with @entity16 in november set @entity89 ablaze with criticism that she was n't large enough to be categorized as such @entity0 called the attention surrounding her @entity14 campaign ' surreal ' and ' strange '			1
' when you 're caught up in the middle of a media blitz , it can be terrifying and stressful , ' she said			0
she added that while she felt as though the attention would never end , the quick turnover of today 's news cycle means that ' you basically blink and your moment is over '			2
however , the upside of being thrust into the spotlight was having the opportunity to inspire other women			0
positive image : ' i want all women to know , regardless of size , shape , color , whatever , that they are powerful beings , ' she said she received emails and comments from women sharing their own stories about body image , which gave her ' a greater feeling of responsibility ' with regard to her career choices			2
@entity0 also revealed that she is an artist and is currently working on a series of collages and drawings			1
' i 'm always in my studio working on something when i 'm not traveling , ' she said			0
as for her subject matter , she added : ' the powerful female body is the fundamental base of all the art i make , but size does n't really play a role			2
' media blitz : @entity0 called the attention surrounding her @entity14 campaign ' surreal ' and ' strange ' earlier this month , @entity0 told @entity137 that she does n't think she is large enough to be considered ' plus - size ' and admitted that she previously lied about her size and stuffed her clothes in order to secure modeling jobs aimed at bigger women			1
she said that she has always felt like an ' in - betweener ' in the fashion industry , with her figure too large for traditional modeling jobs , but too small for plus - size work			1
' you get used to calling yourself a plus - size model when you ’re not , ' she said			1
' it has been hard			0
i can never figure out where i fit in , and i 'm always making someone mad			2
i 'm not skinny - skinny , but i 'm not fat and fabulous either			0
i 'm a size 10			0
