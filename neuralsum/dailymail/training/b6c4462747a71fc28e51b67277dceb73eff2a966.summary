@entity0 broke down in tears after making a successful return to the @entity3 with a dominant win over @entity5 at @entity6			1
it was far from a vintage performance from the 39 - year - old but he did at least begin to lay to rest the ghosts of his horror leg break against @entity12 more than a year ago			1
@entity0 was awarded every round by two of the judges as he consistently beat @entity5 to the punch on the @entity18 's middleweight debut			1
' i went through a lot of suffering [ after the broken leg ] and in the beginning , i did n't think i 'd be back			0
' @entity0 is renowned for his antics in the @entity3 but was uncharacteristically subdued in the opening round as @entity5 opted to start the mind games by briefly lying on the canvas and constantly chattering away to his opponent			1
he threw an early kick but both men were content to circle the other in the opening stages			0
@entity0 landed a one - two as @entity5 swung and missed with his right leg			1
after 90 seconds with barely a shot thrown , @entity0 launched forward with his hands but missed , allowing @entity5 to respond with a leg kick before he too switched up top			1
the former champion finished the round strongly however , landing with two jabs before launching a knee at a backed - up @entity5			2
the second session also started slowly but @entity0 showed no sign of nerves as he flicked out his previously injured leg			2
@entity5 also focused on landing his kicks but took a swift right - left combination to the face			2
an attempted takedown was thwarted by the @entity93 and he again caught the judges ' eyes in the closing seconds			2
although not at his best , @entity0 was landing on @entity5 and the @entity18 's face began to mark up around his left eye in the third stanza which would late require stages			1
he continued to goad @entity101 but the @entity3 legend refused to be drawn in , instead focusing on landing leg kicks on @entity5			0
@entity5 lay down in the first round , taunting @entity0 but the former champion refused to engage in the mind games @entity5 continued to taunt @entity0 , beckoning him to come forward but the @entity93 remained disciplined @entity0 had consistent success with his kicking and did not seem troubled by the leg he injured in 2013 when @entity5 had success , it was with his kicking as he attempted to break down @entity101 on his return @entity5 later claimed he thought he had won every round but punches like this were a rare sight in the fight @entity0 embarked on a victory lap of the @entity3 after the final bell of his middleweight clash with @entity5 @entity5 was badly marked up around his left eye after he was outlanded by @entity101 over the five rounds the @entity122 did at least start the penultimate round brightly but his successes were few and far between			1
@entity0 looked light on his feet as he circled away before landing a right hand			0
but again there was little to keep the @entity130 crowd enthused and there were a smattering of discontented voices among the cheers for @entity0			0
when @entity5 did come forward , @entity0 responded , landing a double jab and leg kick to fend off his attacker			1
needing a finish in the final five minutes , @entity5 engaged briefly but was unable to land cleanly as @entity0 eased through to the bell			1
after a parade lap around the @entity3 , he leapt out to embrace light - heavyweight champion @entity141 before the verdict was announced			0
after crumbling to the canvas in a mixture of joy and relief , he was helped back to his feet by @entity5			2
' i 'll go back to my family , to my home , talk to my kids , and i do n't know [ about fighting again ] , ' @entity0 added			0
' when i called my family and my son says , " congratulations but no more fights "			0
' i love my job but i need to talk to my family because it 's more important			0
' @entity5 , meanwhile , claimed : ' i felt i was ahead most of the time			0
i felt i won every round			0
i was the one coming forward			0
' @entity0 and @entity5 grapple at close quarters but spent most of the fight keeping their distance from one another @entity0 lands right kick to @entity5 's ribs as he continued his assault on the @entity122 's body @entity0 embraces his team following his successful return to the @entity3 after his year on the sidelines @entity0 walks to the @entity3 for the first time in over a year at the @entity130 in @entity170			1

@entity0 dominated @entity5 over five rounds at @entity6
@entity0 was making his return after a year on the sidelines through injury
the @entity93 superstar won by scores of 50 - *45* ( twice ) and 49 - 46
@entity0 lay on the canvas and cried after the result was announced
