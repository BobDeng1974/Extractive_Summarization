her parents turned to social media to start the campaign			0
@entity35 , friend of the family , said : ' after talking to her mother we found that this was her greatest wish , so we started a campaign on @entity41 and on @entity2 forums			2
special birthday : @entity11 with bags of cards and gifts sent to her by people from around the world after an appeal from her parents to make her dream come true delighted : the six - year - old wanted to be just like @entity2 on her sixth birthday who received lots of letters inviting him to @entity5 loving : @entity11 with her sister opening a card on her sixth birthday excited : @entity11 never thought her dream to receive lots of birthday cards would come true ' her big dream is to get a very large number of birthday cards			1
