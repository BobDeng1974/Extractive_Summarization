@entity1 head coach @entity0 has left the door open for record - signing @entity3 after he axed the Â£ 10million man			1
the striker was left out of the squad for the 1 - 0 win at @entity8 on saturday and has so far struggled for form and fitness			1
he has netted once since his record - breaking @entity1 move from @entity11 in the summer , in the 3 - 2 @entity12 win over @entity13 in september			1
@entity3 was left out of last weekend 's @entity1 squad by @entity1 boss @entity0 the @entity15 international picked up an ankle injury in the process but has since recovered and @entity19 is happy to speak to @entity3 if the forward so wishes			1
@entity0 said : ' the way that we do it is i say to any player ' if you want to come in on monday , come in on monday '			2
' but when the team 's named and the subs are named they have to accept that , respect the rest of the players and then come back in later if they want to have a chat			0
' i might have a chat with him if he feels he needs to have a chat , but if he does n't then i wo n't be calling him in			0
' @entity36 has made just two starts in the @entity38 since his record move from @entity11 @entity36 has made just two starts in the @entity38 this season and has made little impact at @entity43			1
@entity0 said his omission was purely for tactical reasons as he picked @entity46 and @entity47 on the bench at the @entity49			2
' i have n't had a chat with him			0
we pick the team carefully even if it 's the same team			0
it 's still chosen with a lot of thought and care - that applies to the subs as well , ' he told the @entity59			0
the @entity1 players celebrate @entity62 's own goal against @entity63 on saturday ' what we knew was that @entity8 had a physical presence			2
generally , i have two centre - forwards on the bench			0
' i decided that i needed physical options there rather than somebody like @entity3 - whose strengths are running in behind			1
that 's why i went for @entity46 and @entity73 ( @entity47 )			0

@entity0 *leaves* door open for @entity3 following squad axe
@entity3 was missing from squad for 1 - 0 win against @entity8
@entity81 has made just two @entity38 starts
