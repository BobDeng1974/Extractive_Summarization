by @entity1 reporter published : 20:03 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 30 may 2013 a city 's takeaways could be banned from serving hot food during school hours under plans to tackle childhood obesity			1
chip shops , kebab houses and fast - food chains such as @entity12 ’s near schools would not be allowed to serve hot food to any customers – including adults – before 5pm in a shake - up of planning regulations put forward by @entity18 council			1
@entity19 , the council ’s assistant mayor , said : ‘ takeaways create jobs and provide a service , but these ideas are to make sure they are opening in the right places and not having a negative impact			1
@entity27 : @entity28 hopes to ban takeaways from serving hot food before 5pm in a bid to tackle childhood obesity ‘ we do n’t think they should be serving hot food before 5pm near schools , as children should be encouraged to eat healthily			1
' public health and helping to reduce obesity levels are a top priority , and while planners can not control the food that is sold we would like every new premise to offer well promoted healthy alternatives so people can have an informed choice about the food they eat			2
' residents are encouraged to come forward with any comments or suggestions so they can be taken into consideration before a decision is made on the future of planning in our city			2
' no treats : even adults wo n't be able to buy fast food like chips under the proposed regulations put forward by @entity18 last year , @entity18 officials announced they wanted a ban on mobile takeaway and ice cream vans near schools , but the new policy , which would apply only to new takeaways , extends this to permanent fast - food premises			1
but @entity70 , manager of @entity71 in @entity18 , said : ‘ this is ridiculous			0
nothing is more healthy than fresh fish			0
' and chips cooked the right way are nutritious			0
it should be down to kids ’ parents what they eat			0
’ local residents were sceptical about whether the idea would work			0
nursery nurse @entity83 , 23 , said : ' i do n’t think it will work			0
obesity starts at home , and it depends much more on what the parents are feeding them the rest of the time			0
' the ban would hit grown - up workers too - maybe that ’s a good thing as some of them need it			2
' the plans are not the first time a council has tried to tackle obesity by cracking down on takeaways – in 2011 , @entity102 council considered bringing in a £ 1,000 ‘ fat tax ’ on hot food traders , but the plan was scrapped .			1
