that was a massive statement by @entity1 in @entity2 , very encouraging indeed , but they need to start preparing immediately for a massive backlash from the @entity5 next week			1
@entity1 can bring their a game and their a team into next week ’s game but so can @entity5			1
@entity5 looked flat and a little uninspired for parts on saturday			1
it ’s not easy playing your first game in six months with everyone expecting you to win by a cricket score - but they will be in top gear from the off next week			0
proud : @entity1 's players fought valiantly but were defeated by @entity5 in @entity2 @entity1 need to keep their feet firmly on the ground because it will be a ‘ different ’ @entity5 in @entity23			1
and to counter that @entity24 will need a ‘ different ’ @entity1 team to match them			1
the facts are @entity1 did not score a try and lost the game and they must improve by some margin to come away with a win			2
the good news is that because of the schedule @entity1 are in the unusual position of having a lot of cards to play in the second test			2
traditionally @entity5 can splutter a little in their opening test of a home series before getting their act together and routing the opposition			2
they always gather momentum and sharpen up their game			0
stepping up : @entity44 was one of several fringe players who impressed against @entity5 this time though @entity1 have some big - time players to reintroduce to the team and add momentum			1
despite some fine performances by the stand - ins - @entity44 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 - @entity1 must go with their @entity56 , as close to the team that finished the @entity58 as possible			2
the one thing @entity1 must not be thinking , even subconsciously this week , is that they are in a good place			1
they need to stay sharp and on edge			0
the reality is that they are 1 - 0 down and will be facing a @entity5 team who will improve by at least 50 per cent			2
but @entity1 can reach another level as well			0
the performances from the guys who stepped in yesterday add considerably to @entity1 ’s strength in depth but now is the time for @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 to return , and @entity78 as well if he has recovered			0
@entity1 have an opportunity to achieve something very special down in the ‘ glasshouse ’ but the gun needs to be fully loaded , @entity1 need to fire all their shots			0
physical : @entity1 went toe to toe with @entity5 on their own back yard in @entity2 it could be a fantastic spectacle and if @entity1 can win , if they can return home later this month with one @entity91 win , it will be a huge boost to their @entity93 prospects			1
as for yesterday i ’m not sure who the official man of the match was but @entity1 skipper @entity98 was magnificent			0
it ’s not often you see @entity101 so anonymous in a game			0
i ca n’t recall any turnovers from the @entity5 skipper or forcing penalties , which is normally his forte			0
@entity101 might have been just suffering from @entity5 ’s general malaise but @entity1 ’s directness and physicality at the breakdown helped negate him on saturday			1
part of me still wants to see @entity98 at blindside in a big match - he could be phenomenal there - but it wo n’t happen on this tour			0
it can only happen if @entity1 have a world - class seven to slot in			0
they do - but @entity118 was playing for the @entity119 against the @entity120 on saturday ! close : @entity1 skipper @entity98 looks dejected after his team 's narrow defeat decisions : @entity1 coach @entity24 will have some selection choices to make in @entity23			1

@entity1 laid down a huge marker against @entity5 despite being beaten
the @entity5 looked *sluggish* and uninspired in parts
@entity24 's side must prepare for a better @entity5 performance next week
