@entity0 is entering @entity1 of his international career			1
having recently retired from the shortest form , he plans to wind down in the other two and then , a little surprisingly , finish up with a couple of seasons in county cricket			1
when mapping out his future beyond @entity9 ’s two tests this month , @entity0 , 36 , talks with boyish enthusiasm for the @entity12 domestic game			1
so far he has had just a couple of bite - sized chunks , seven seasons apart			2
but he sells the chill of @entity18 ’s @entity17 , his temporary home for a fortnight last month , like it ’s the sunshine of the @entity21			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity23 play an impromptu game with locals in @entity26 phew ! @entity0 admits relief that @entity23 will not be facing @entity9 in the @entity29 series out ! @entity23 was omitted following question marks over his attitude during the @entity33 defeat put simply , to recruit @entity0 is to recruit a great of the game			1
his @entity29 average going into the first test against @entity38 at @entity39 on thursday is a jaw - dropping 58.07			1
not since @entity40 ( 60.97 ) was stymied in his prime by @entity43 ’s sporting isolation 44 years ago has a player ended with such a high return			2
in addition to his test acumen , he is one of only four players to have scored more than 12,000 runs in one - day internationals			1
not bad for a guy who keeps wicket			1
‘ my end in one - day cricket will be the @entity55 , if i get there fit and in form , ’ he says			1
‘ then we ’ll sit down and see whether i am needed for @entity29			2
‘ who knows whether a county will have me for a season or two ? i would like to wind down slowly as it can be a bit of a shock to the system if you stop completely			2
a couple of seasons ( in @entity38 ) would be fantastic			1
i really enjoyed my time in 2007 with @entity68 , and @entity18 have been great			2
i like the feel of county dressing rooms			2
there is a huge amount of ability in them and a huge amount of hunger			0
‘ @entity18 have been exceptional in that sense			0
for a side that ’s won the @entity81 three times in six years , they seem to have a fantastic attitude , both towards each other and wanting to achieve more			2
i always say that learning is a two - way street , but once i ’ve finished my international career it will be about trying to do a proper job for the county i ’m in			2
big hitter : @entity0 has a test average of 58.07 and has hit more than 12,000 runs in @entity92 ‘ cricket brings out who you are as a person			1
it requires mental strength but also strength of character			0
but it ’s only a game			0
there ’s a lot more to life that you can experience and it will enhance what you do out there in the middle			0
i have been pretty lucky that way , so anything i can do to share my experiences would be welcome			0
’ @entity0 is clear on what has been his driving force			1
‘ it ’s about ensuring that i ’m the best i can be			0
your aim is to reach a standard of excellence you are happy with and leave the game a bit better for you having played it			0
‘ all the time you are striving to meet your goals — trying to get as many test hundreds as you can , trying to get into the 10,000 - run club ( which he achieved in the 2012 @entity121 at @entity122 )			2
these are things that i did not think possible at one time in my career			0
as i got accustomed to international cricket those became goals i set for myself			2
’ spray it again : @entity9 players celebrate their 3 - 2 victory over @entity38 in their recent one - day tour great loss : @entity0 was ' bitterly disappointed at losing coach @entity133 ( r ) to @entity38 @entity0 thinks highly of @entity134 , the @entity12 who spent four months as @entity9 head coach up to the @entity136 win in april before he was headhunted by the @entity137 to become the new assistant to @entity139			1
‘ from @entity133 ’s time in 2007 , as assistant to @entity142 , he proved to be a fantastic human being and a really great , rounded coach , ’ affirms @entity0			1
‘ caring about players , and being able to express that , elicits a far better response than chunks of strategy and analysis			0
one loss in 18 games and a @entity55 win ! ‘ it was bitterly disappointing for the side to lose him			0
we would have liked it to continue for a lot longer			0
’ quite a catch : wicket keeper revealed he would like to end his career playing county cricket in @entity38 @entity0 ’s recent stint with @entity18 was an exercise in tightening technique			1
combating the moving ball in @entity38 will be paramount to @entity9 ’s chances on what is traditionally one of the toughest tours for @entity172 cricketers			1
having struggled against @entity173 on his debut , @entity0 responded by taking 159 off @entity176 ’s attack , his highest score in @entity38 to date			1
‘ playing in @entity38 is a challenge but not insurmountable , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ the key is for guys like me to get the runs on the board to put pressure on the opposition			0
one thing you accept with experience is that getting out in the first couple of overs is all right			0
getting to 20 or 30 and making a silly mistake is not			0
’ @entity38 are clearly in transition : only a handful of players remain from the test side that shared the short series in @entity9 two years ago			1
most notably , @entity23 ( ostracised ) and @entity196 ( retired ) have gone			1
@entity0 , though , is mystified that any international team would seek change in a bid for uniformity			1
it takes all sorts : accomodating different individuals like @entity204 is crucial , says @entity0 ‘ accommodating difference and valuing individuality are the most important things in a dressing room , ’ he says			1
‘ for us , it ’s been like that with @entity204 ( @entity212 )			1
he is very different in the way he looks and as a person			0
there are certain people you might not have dinner with , but that does n’t take away from the fact they will be valuable players in a national cause , going out trying to win matches			0
‘ i do n’t know the reasons for @entity23 ’s exclusion but he ’s an amazing player			1
i ’ve watched him , admired him and he is undoubtedly an out - and - out match - winner			0
‘ of course , as an opposition player i ’m not disappointed he ’s not around			0
we know what damage he could have done to us			0
to not have him walk in — that presence he has — is a bit of a relief			0
