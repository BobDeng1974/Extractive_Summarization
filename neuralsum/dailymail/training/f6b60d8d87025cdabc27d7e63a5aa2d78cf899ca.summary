by @entity0 a travel company boss has captured what could be the ultimate selfie after photographing himself at the top of @entity7 's iconic @entity6 statue			1
very few people are able to climb the landmark in @entity10 , but @entity11 was able to convince the @entity7 tourist board to let him scale the monument			1
it took the 31 - year - old almost half an hour to reach the summit of 124ft - high statue , climbing narrow steps where a single misplaced move would have resulted in serious injury , or worse			1
he then managed to take a photograph of himself in one of the greatest ever selfies			2
mr @entity11 , who co-founded group travel firm www.theflashpack.co.uk , said : ' i think it must be the first selfie from the top of @entity6			1
' the climb took 25 minutes			0
they had been repairing it after a lightning storm and we managed to convince the @entity7 tourist board to allow us to climb to the top			1
world at his feet : very few people are able to climb the landmark in @entity10 , but mr @entity11 was able to convince the @entity7 tourist board to let him scale the monument ' it was extremely hot , eerily quiet and claustrophobic			1
it was really quite scary			0
' the last bit sees you climbing a tiny , very tight staircase and if you fall , you fall a long way			0
' when i popped my head out of the top it took my breath away			2
the view really was incredible			0
it is the most fun selfie i 've taken and one of my favourite photos			0
' everyone says it is crazy and it makes them feel sick just looking at it			0
' i have had lots of messages from @entity7 who say it is something they have always wanted to do			2
' very few people have ever been able to do it			0
' iconic : the @entity6 statue is one of @entity7 's most famous landmarks , and will no doubt be visted by hundreds of football fans as they flock to the country for this month 's @entity86 iconic : @entity6 standing atop the 2,300ft - high @entity88 mountain , overlooking the city of @entity10 , @entity7 , the statue of @entity6 , or @entity6 in @entity91 , is one of the @entity95 country 's most iconic landmarks			1
the statue , depicting @entity97 and used as a symbol of @entity7 christianity , was the largest @entity100 statue in the world when it was completed in 1931 , a record which stood until 2010 when it was beaten by the @entity104 statue in @entity105			2
the statue itself is 98ft tall , and it stands atop a 26ft pedestal			0
its arms reach 92 ft wide and the statue , made out of reinforced concrete and soapstone , weighs 635 tonnes			0
work began on the statue in 1922 , after it was first proposed by catholic priest @entity116 in the mid- 1850s , who requested money from @entity119 , @entity119 to build a large religious monument on @entity88			2
however , the regent , ruling on behalf of her father @entity121 , was not keen on the idea and it was dismissed outright in 1889 when @entity7 became a republic with laws mandating the separation of church and state			2
in 1920 a second scheme for a statue on the mountain was put forward by the @entity132 of @entity10 , funded by donations from @entity7 @entity134 , and other designs considered included @entity137 cross , a statue of @entity97 with a globe in his hands , and a pedestal symbolizing the world			1
local engineer @entity143 designed the winning statue , which was then sculpted by @entity105 - @entity146 artist @entity145 , with the face created by @entity149 sculptor @entity148			2
construction took nine years , from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of $ 250,000 , worth around $ 3,300,000 in today 's money			0
in october 2006 , on the statue 's 75th anniversary , archbishop of rio cardinal @entity153 consecrated a chapel named after the patron saint of @entity7 - @entity159 , or ' @entity160 ' - under the statue			1
this allows @entity134 to hold baptisms and weddings at the site			0
the monument has been struck by lightning many times , including during an electrical storm in february 2008 where it suffered damage on the fingers , head and eyebrows			1
the @entity10 state government commenced a restoration project on the statue to replace part of the soapstone layers and repair its lightning rods			1
however , in january this year it was damaged again in a storm and a finger on the right hand was dislodged			0
due to strong winds and erosion , as well as lightning , maintenance work is regularly carried out on the statue , and as the original stone used is increasingly rare replacement stones are darker in colour			0
the statue is one of the best - known symbols of @entity7 and has featured in a number of films , music videos and television shows , including @entity200 's @entity201 , the disaster film 2012 , in which it crumbles after an earthquake , animated films @entity10 and @entity206 , and television series @entity207 .			1
