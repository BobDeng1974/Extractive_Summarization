by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:45 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:48 est , 30 december 2013 almost half of women say they feel guilty about their carbohydrate consumption , a new study revealed with @entity11 over and @entity10 looming , many of us are turning our thoughts to diets and @entity10 ’s resolutions			1
and this year it seems carbohydrates will be on the hit list			0
new research suggests nearly 50 per cent of women feel guilty about eating them			1
the study of 3,000 people revealed many believe removing carbohydrates from their diet is an effective way to shed the pounds			1
however , @entity26 , professor in health psychology at the @entity28 , and designer of the new survey , claims this is dangerous as carbohydrates are an ‘ essential ’ part of people ’s diets			1
she said : ‘ if they realise that carbohydrates have an essential part in their diets , not only for energy but also for building long - term sustainable healthy habits , then carbohydrates can resume their place as a central part of how they eat			1
’ professor @entity26 added that rather than cutting out all carbohydrates , people should try to steer clear of sugary ‘ bad carbs ’			1
she says the problem with avoiding carbohydrates altogether is that it means people feel hungry and that this leads to snacking on fatty , sugary foods			1
this , she explains , can lead to an unhealthy , vicious cycle			0
the new survey , which was conducted from the weight - loss supplement @entity50 , also revealed that women are twice as likely as men to feel guilty about their carbohydrate consumption - despite the fact they are less likely to be overweight			1
one in ten women say they constantly feel bad about their carb consumption while a quarter say they try to avoid eating them during the week so they can eat more at the weekends			1
it also found that most people are unsure how much carbohydrate they ought to eat each day			2
a quarter of women say they avoid carbs during the week so they can overindulge at the weekends the government currently recommends that about half of a person ’s daily calorie intake should be in the form of carbohydrates but most people surveyed significantly underestimated the amount of food that would amount to			1
in reality , this would add up to about one bowl of cereal , two slices of bread , a portion of pasta and three oatcakes			0
while professor @entity26 is clear in her opinion that carbohydrates should remain a key part of people ’s diets , nutritionist @entity87 disagrees			1
many women believe cutting carbohydrates from their diet is a quick and effective way to lose weight but some experts fear this is dangerous as they are ' essential ' she claims it is illogical to say people should avoid carbohydrates that are high in sugar , because all carbohydrates break down into sugar			1
she told @entity107 : ‘ this shows nutritional ignorance			0
telling people to cut down on sugar but to eat more carbohydrate is like telling people to use the car less but to consume more petrol			2
‘ all carbs break down into sugars			0
whether polysaccharides ( many sugars ) , disaccharides ( two sugars ) or mono saccharides ( single sugars ) - all carbs break down into sugar			0
’ she added : ‘ carbs are not essential			2
essential in nutrition means that the substance must be consumed - the body does n't make it			0
‘ there are essential fats			0
there are essentials proteins ( certain amino acids )			0
there are no essential carbs			2
’ she added : ‘ women are right to be wary of carbs - they make us fat			2
’ she explained that women only need about 500 calories a day for energy and that these needs can be met from fat or carbohydrates			2
the other 1,500 calories a woman requires are for functions such as cell repair and fighting infection and carbohydrates can not meet these needs			0
as a result , she says people who eat more than 500 calories of carbs every day are likely to be overweight			1
while there is debate about the importance of carbohydrates in people ’s diets , there can be no argument about obesity statistics			2
in @entity165 last year , 58 per cent of women and 65 per cent of men were overweight			0
in 1993 , 58 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women were overweight or obese			0
@entity168 , an independent dietician , said that carbs are the body ’s main source of energy – and the brain ’s only source			0
echoing professor @entity26 ’s concern , she said : ‘ it is completely wrong to demonise carbohydrates			1
those who do have the wrong end of the stick			0

many people think cutting out carbs is an effective way to lose weight
one in ten women feel constantly guilty about their carb consumption
a quarter avoid them during the week so they can indulge at the weekend
@entity26 , a health psychology professor , thinks avoiding them is dangerous as they are an ' essential ' part of people *'s* diets
but nutritionist @entity87 disagrees and says carbohydrates are not essential and that people who eat too many risk being overweight
