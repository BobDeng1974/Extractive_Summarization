an art student at @entity1 has taken a positive stand on self love and is sharing her secrets to accepting her flaws through a series of stunning self - portraits - and motivational speaking			1
three years ago on @entity10 , @entity9 was standing in front of her mirror , vowing to change herself - but also to love herself more , after enduring years of cruel comments from her peers , and an ever - present feeling of self - doubt			1
now , at only 18 , @entity9 is sharing details of how she learned to accept herself for who she is – and how , through her love of art , she learned to find beauty within her own appearance			1
picture perfect : 18 - year - old @entity1 painting student @entity9 recently gave a speech at the university on learning to love one 's self unconditionally the artist : @entity9 specializes in self - portraits , which she began painting in high school earlier this month , @entity9 gave a moving motivational speech titled ' @entity32 ' , during which the @entity34 native @entity9 recounted her journey to self - acceptance and eagerly shared the lessons she has learned			1
the path to this realization came after @entity9 made that @entity42 's resolution in 2012			2
she joined the track team at her high school and lost 50 pounds , eventually being able to stand in front of that mirror again and call herself beautiful			0
she also began painting self - portraits as a means of embracing her own appearance and finding beauty within every flaw			1
' @entity53 did i know that love was so conditional , ' @entity9 explained in her speech , reports @entity56			1
' it was like accepting the terms and conditions that you check when you 're making a new @entity61 or something			0
' but then over the summer of junior year , @entity9 gained the weight back			2
' every pound that i gained , i lost a pound of love , ' she said			0
' so you can do the math of how much love i lost for myself			0
i would look at myself in the mirror and say , " oh my gosh			0
" ' lessons learned : @entity9 's journey began after making a @entity42 's resolution to lose weight and love herself more back in 2012 talented : before coming to @entity1 , the @entity34 native had been accepted to a highly - selective art program at the @entity79 for the arts however , her paintings tell a different story			1
' when it comes to painting a self - portrait , i could turn those things that i did n't really love into something that was beautiful not only to me , but to others , ' @entity9 told @entity89			1
beauty is something that we have learned over time , ' @entity9 told @entity89			0
' now i 'm actually understanding that it 's not other people accepting me that leads to happiness			0
' focusing more on her artistic flair than her physical appearance , @entity9 became more confident , more outspoken , and vowed to take more risks			2
she was accepted to a highly - selective art program at the @entity102 and even had the confidence to confess to a man that she thought he was ' the most beautiful man on this damn earth			0
' but for @entity9 , the real moment of self - acceptance came one night when she was getting ready to go out , and noticed that her jeans were not fitting quite right			2
' little did i know that love was so conditional ' : @entity9 lost 50 pounds after deciding she wanted to change her appearance , but later gained the weight back , which caused her to change her outlook taking the stage : @entity9 recently decided to share her journey to self - acceptance with her peers ' my love - handles was poking out a little bit , so i looked in the mirror and said " oh , that does n’t look too good , but somebody ’s going to love them someday , " ' she explained			1
@entity9 says that she realized then that she could not count on others for validation on loving herself , because , as she told the @entity1 crowd : ' you are the only thing that you are promised your entire life			2
' ' we learn that if something is flawed , it 's supposed to become something else , ' she added to @entity89			0
' and i am learning that i , @entity83 , my body , everything , it does not need to be like something else			0
