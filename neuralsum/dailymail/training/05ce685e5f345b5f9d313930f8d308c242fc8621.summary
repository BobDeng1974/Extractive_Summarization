tornadoes in the @entity2 are increasingly hitting in swarms rather than as isolated twisters , new figures reveal			1
the average number of twisters per year - around 500 - has not changed for decades			1
but now as many as 115 can strike in just one day , leaving more weeks tornado - free			2
and the pattern does not seem to be reverting			0
the study released by @entity2 government meteorologists on thursday charted the nation 's tornado database from 1954 to 2013 , excluding twisters with wind speeds below 112mph			1
it found that since 1970s , at least five days a year will see 20 or more tornadoes - more than double the average beforehand			1
in recent years , there were on average three days with more than 30 tornadoes , compared with just one day a year four decades ago			1
and on the list of the 10 single days with the most tornadoes since 1954 , eight have occurred since 1999 , including five since 2011			2
that year alone had days with 115 , 73 , 53 and 52 twisters			1
' we need more resources â€¦ even if we do n't use them very often , ' @entity35 , an atmospheric scientist at the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) told @entity39			2
may is the month with the most tornado activity , followed by june and april			0
although some weather experts have blamed climate change for the shift in patterns , the report does not stipulate a cause			2
' knowing that the climate now has changed from that of the 1970s makes for a circumstantial argument in favor of a changing climate playing at least some role in the tornado changes , ' said meteorologist @entity54 of @entity36 's @entity55			0
' there are indications that heavy rainfall events are occurring with greater frequency globally , and given a warmer climate , this makes sense , ' added @entity55 meteorologist @entity63			0
urgent : experts warn emergency services must step up the level of resources to deal with natural disasters but ' any trend in tornado events is much more difficult to discern , ' @entity63 added			1
' the links in the chain connecting them are n't complete yet , ' @entity35 told @entity39			0
records for both the most and fewest tornadoes over a 12 - month period have come in the past five years , with 1,050 from june 2010 to may 2011 and 236 tornadoes from may 2012 to april 2013			0
tornadoes , rapidly spinning columns of air usually spawned by rotating thunderstorms , can be among the most violent weather events			0
they have been reported on every continent except @entity84 but most often hit a @entity2 region covering the @entity86 and parts of the @entity88 and @entity89			1
tornadoes can cause extensive loss of life and property damage like the may 2011 twister in @entity95 , @entity96 , that killed about 160 people and wrecked thousands of homes .			0

average number of twisters is the same but more are hitting at once
study by @entity2 government found three days a year see 30 or more
five days a year see over 20 - more than double the average before 1970
experts warn emergency services must step up resources to handle *crises*
