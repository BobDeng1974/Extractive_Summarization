on @entity1 's first day of primary school , the six - year - old cancer survivor refused to take off her hat			1
after five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery , the kindergarten student from @entity5 on the north coast of @entity7 , was most concerned about her missing long hair			1
' she used to have beautiful , long curly hair that she used to love â€“ she 's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for @entity1 , ' her mother @entity14 , 33 , told @entity15			0
@entity1 ( left ) was diagnosed with stage one cancer when she was five			2
she and her sister @entity18 ( right ) would wear tights and tea - towels on their heads to help @entity1 cope with losing her beloved hair on her first day of school , the six - year - old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for ' looking like a boy ' ' when she first started school , she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy			1
they 'd call her ugly			0
' one of her daughter 's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea - towel on her head			0
' one day @entity39 just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said " this is my beautiful long hair " and @entity18 , being her little sister , just copied , ' she said			2
the sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads , even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit			2
when she was five year 's old , a urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in @entity1 's left kidney			0
she was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ			0
the kindergarten student had her left kidney removed after she was found to have a @entity59 tumour @entity1 , pictured with her parents @entity14 and @entity61 ( left ) , also underwent five months of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair according to @entity65 from the cancer charity @entity67 , @entity1 is one of 10,000 children across @entity69 who are currently newly diagnosed , under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment			1
mr @entity65 told @entity15 that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment , just as things are starting to look up , one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying			2
' we 've heard about everything from pointing and staring and : ' mummy , why does she looks so different ? ' to exclusion and isolation , ' mr @entity65 said			0
' exclusion is one of the more common ones , kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it 's contagious			0
@entity67 has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer ' we hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called ' baldie ' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it '			1
@entity67 is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment , while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer			1
the charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers , to expel the myths around cancer			2
@entity65 , a spokesperson for the cancer charity , said that by the end of the show , the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat the show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer , including that it is contagious , encouraging them to support and include kids with their show , which has been view by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running , involves a bald cancer - patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat			1
' by the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat , ' mr @entity65 explains			0
' once our puppet show had come to one school , we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she did n't wear it from then on			0
once we teach the students about it , that child becomes a sort of hero for all they 've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend			0
' after mrs @entity1 asked @entity67 to come to her daughter 's school to perform their puppet show , she said there was an instant change in attitude			1
now , whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was , @entity1 - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she 's looking forward to having long hair again .			1
