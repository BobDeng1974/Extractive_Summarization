by @entity1 reporter published : 14:16 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 05:57 est , 12 march 2014 @entity4 's screams for help could n't save her on the night she was murdered outside her apartment in 1964			1
fifty years later , those screams still echo , a symbol of urban breakdown and city dwellers ' seeming callousness toward their neighbors			0
the case ' caught the spirit of the time , ' said @entity17 , a police historian			0
' it seemed to symbolize that society no longer cared about other people			0
' @entity21 murder : @entity4 , 28 , was stabbed to death march 13 , 1964 , in a random attack , which captivated @entity25 after the @entity26 reported that 38 people witnessed the murder and did not help her @entity31 's random stabbing by @entity32 on march 13 , 1964 , became a sensation when the @entity26 reported that ' 38 respectable , law - abiding citizens ' in @entity35 watched the attack unfold over more than half an hour and did n't call police during the assault			1
' while more recent reporting — some of it by the @entity26 itself — found that the number of people who actually saw the murder was greatly exaggerated and that some neighbors did try to help , the @entity31 case left its mark on public policy and psychology			1
monster : @entity32 was convicted of murdering @entity31 and sentenced to death , a punishment later reduced to life n prison it has been credited with spurring adoption of the 911 system in 1968 as well as ' @entity61 ' laws that give legal protection to people who help those in trouble			1
the case also gave rise to research into the ' bystander effect ' — the phenomenon in which a group of onlookers fails to help someone in distress — and is often featured in psychology textbooks			0
at least five books about @entity31 's killing have come out recently or will be published this year , a testament to the enduring fascination with the case			2
' many people were murdered that year , over 600 , but she haunts us because she could have been helped and nobody did , ' said @entity83 , a journalist and author of the e-book ' @entity86 , inside the case that rocked our faith in each other			0
' according to police reports and trial testimony , @entity31 was a 28 - year - old bar manager living in the seemingly safe , well - kept neighborhood of @entity94 when she was attacked while returning home from work after 3am			1
@entity97 later told police he had been driving around looking for a woman to kill			2
he spotted @entity31 , chased her and stabbed her in the back			2
@entity31 screamed , and a neighbor yelled from his window , ' leave that girl alone ! ' @entity97 retreated to his car but returned minutes later and found @entity31 in a hallway at the back of her building , where she had collapsed			1
he stabbed her several more times and raped her as she lay dying			1
crime scene revisited : a pedestrian uses the stairway leading past the entrance to 82 - 70 austin street in @entity35 , where @entity31 was viciously attacked a half - century ago gruesome details : @entity31 was initially stabbed in the back and collapsed at the back of her building , where her attacker later found her , stabbed her again multiple times and raped her as she lay dying the story was not widely reported until @entity121 , then metro editor of the @entity26 , had lunch with police commissioner @entity123 , who told him about the 38 witnesses			1
@entity121 assigned a reporter to write a story about the neighbors ' apathy			0
' i did n't want to get involved , ' one neighbor was quoted as saying			0
the story seemed to show that @entity25 was an urban hell where no one would lift a finger to help a neighbor			2
' it fit some people 's anti-new @entity25 perspective , ' said @entity139 , a retired professor of psychology at @entity141			2
some later accounts of @entity31 's murder challenged the @entity26 ' version			1
@entity145 , author of ' @entity4 : the murder , the @entity147 , the crime that changed @entity149 , ' argues that only a few neighbors saw enough of the attack to understand much of what was going on , and some of them tried to help			2
the @entity26 revisited the case in 2004 on the 40th anniversary			0
a former prosecutor told the paper then that while far fewer than 38 saw the murder , many others heard the screams			0
@entity162 's grin : escaped killer @entity32 , laughingly tells newsmen he regrets only being caught after his capture in a suburban @entity166 apartment house @entity167 argues in her book ' @entity4 : a @entity169 and its private consequences ' that the reporting from 1964 was fundamentally correct : ' many people heard the screams and had very good reasonable cause to believe that a crime was taking place			1
' ' the most chilling part is that once she reached the back of the building , she was lying down there for several minutes calling for help , ' @entity167 added			0
' she was saying , " it 's @entity182 ! i 'm stabbed ! help me ! " ' @entity97 was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , a punishment later reduced to life in prison			1
he escaped during a transfer to a hospital in @entity191 in 1968 , took five people hostage and raped a woman in front of her husband before surrendering to police			1
now 79 , @entity97 is one of the longest - serving inmates in the @entity200 prison system			2
in reaction to the case , @entity202 professor @entity201 began studying bystander behavior as a graduate student in 1978			0
working under the social psychologist @entity207 , @entity201 conducted experiments that involved pretending to commit crimes to observe bystanders ' reaction			0
pretreated : @entity97 escaped during a transfer to a hospital in @entity191 in 1968 , took five people hostage and raped a woman in front of her husband before surrendering to police ' the field emerged entirely because of her , and now it 's a very large field , ' @entity201 said			1
@entity31 emerges in the new books as a compelling figure in her own right , a high - spirited young woman known as the class cut - up in high school			2
the oldest in an @entity226 - @entity149 family of five children , @entity31 grew up in @entity228 and stayed in @entity25 when the rest of her family moved to @entity231 , @entity232 , in the mid- 1950s			1
at the time of her death , she had been living with a partner , @entity235 , for about a year			0
' she was a daughter and a sister and a lover and a colleague , ' said @entity239 , a filmmaker who is working with @entity31 's younger brother on a documentary about @entity31 called ' @entity242			0
' '' she was n't just a victim			0

@entity31 , 28 , was stabbed multiple times by @entity32 and raped as she lay *bleeding* to death march 13 , 1964 , in @entity35 , @entity25
@entity26 reported at the time that 38 people witnessed the attack but did n't move a finger to help the victim
