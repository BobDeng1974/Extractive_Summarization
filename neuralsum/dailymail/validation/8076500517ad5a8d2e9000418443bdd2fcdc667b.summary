after little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for @entity2 , @entity0 removed the captain ’s armband from his left bicep and handed it to @entity6			1
he did so out of respect			0
he did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second - half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club			0
but four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when @entity6 might have felt it appropriate to hand it back			0
@entity0 scored a second - half winner for @entity2 as they continued their impressive recent form @entity0 runs off to celebrate his winner that moved @entity2 within two points of the @entity23 's top four a delighted @entity0 let out a roar for the @entity2 fans in the @entity26 @entity0 's shot was deflected over the top of @entity31 goalkeeper @entity30 's head and into the back of the net @entity0 was mobbed by his team - mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in @entity37 @entity31 : @entity30 6 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 6 ( @entity43 80 ) , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 7 , @entity46 7.5 , @entity47 7 ( @entity48 89 ) , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 73 )			1

ref : @entity75 ( @entity76 ) ratings by @entity78 @entity0 , whose heat map is shown above , produced another commanding performance in @entity2 's @entity81 it was then , 68 minutes into this contest , that @entity0 did something that has long been synonymous with @entity6 : he came to @entity2 ’s rescue			1
if it lacked finesse , and owed more to good fortune , a winning goal that narrowed the gap to @entity91 in the fierce battle for @entity94 places owed everything to @entity0 ’s desire and determination			1
it was an ugly goal , @entity39 ’s attempted clearance spinning off @entity0 ’s shin and flying beyond the reach of @entity30			1
but it was @entity0 who made the run in pursuit of @entity64 ’s flick - on and @entity0 , after a stuttering first half , who had given @entity2 impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break			1
the goal was @entity0 's third in the last three @entity23 games after his strikes against @entity116 and @entity117 @entity2 recorded their fifth successive @entity23 victory ahead of their huge clash against @entity91 on sunday @entity0 clattered into @entity45 with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but @entity75 opted not to even book him			1
if @entity6 had an impact , it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed @entity0 to get forward			2
and the fact the goal came so soon after @entity6 ’s first appearance in eight games reflected well , once again , on @entity130			1
@entity130 deserves enormous credit for the run of results @entity2 are enjoying			1
it is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at @entity137 in december and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal , an achievement that equals the club record set by @entity143 in 1972			0
@entity130 has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side			1
it has been tactically astute leadership			0
but @entity130 also needed players to step out of @entity6 ’s shadow and prove they can survive without him			2
nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in @entity0 now reflecting on three goals in @entity2 ’s last three games			1
the pressure was on here with sunday ’s game against @entity91 at @entity161 and a trip to @entity163 to follow			1
and against a @entity31 side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of @entity169 , @entity2 struggled in that opening 45 minutes			2
@entity170 might have been the managerial apprentice but @entity130 would have recognised how well @entity31 ’s players had mastered their boss ’s instructions			2
they were excellent , using the pace and power of @entity46 to good effect			0
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity56 makes a full - stretch save to deny @entity31 's @entity47 a goal in the first half @entity2 's @entity181 goalkeeper @entity56 had to make a number of important stops in the first half as @entity31 piled on the pressure @entity31 midfielder @entity49 evades a challenge from @entity2 midfielder @entity0 @entity2 , by contrast , were disappointing , with @entity0 among those losing possession far too cheaply			1
@entity6 brought much - needed composure to @entity2 ’s midfield			2
given how well @entity2 had been playing , the decision to omit @entity6 from the line - up was understandable			2
he had been injured , after all			0
and @entity2 started with their usual intensity , the pressing game that is designed to dominate their opponents and stop them playing			2
but @entity31 were managing to attack effectively on the counter , with @entity46 accelerating past @entity198 only for @entity61 to make an important interception			0
in the end @entity200 had a real chance to score but his header was weak and cleared by the outstanding @entity57			0
@entity2 's @entity63 takes on @entity31 left back @entity41 at the @entity26 @entity0 hands the captain 's armband to @entity6 after he came off the bench for @entity2 in the second half @entity0 looks set to be in charge of the armband for the long term when @entity6 leaves @entity161 at the end of the season @entity6 made a return from injury as he came on in the second half of the @entity23 clash in south @entity37 @entity170 rues missed chances @entity2 have kept six straight away clean sheets in the top - flight for the third time in their history , and the first since 1972			1
the other run came in 1966			0
@entity57 would make another headed clearance to deny @entity46 , who had escaped the clutches of the @entity2 back four to meet a cross from @entity38 with a better header			2
@entity31 were dominating possession and @entity46 was proving a proper threat			0
a neat one - two with @entity49 and he was through on goal with only @entity56 to beat , but much to @entity169 ’s dismay his shot was scuffed and @entity2 ’s goalkeeper made the save			1
an effort from @entity65 aside — it was gathered neatly by @entity30 — @entity2 offered little in response			0
@entity2 striker @entity64 tries to wriggle away from a challenge from @entity31 's @entity238 @entity31 's @entity42 drifts away from @entity2 's @entity65 , who loses his footing @entity2 defender @entity57 clears the ball under pressure from @entity31 centre back @entity40 @entity31 were offering plenty , @entity56 making a hugely impressive diving save to deny @entity47 before @entity59 diverted a powerful strike from @entity45 to safety with a courageous header			0
but after the interval @entity2 were better — there was more urgency , more composure , with @entity0 very much at the centre of things , even if the arrival of @entity6 from the bench was important			1
that gave @entity0 freedom to bomb on and in the 68th minute he chased a fine ball forward from @entity57 that was diverted into the @entity31 box by @entity64			1
@entity47 attempts a shot from distance for @entity31 as @entity61 and @entity58 attempt to close him down @entity39 and @entity0 gave chase , with @entity39 winning the race but not the contest			0
it was tough on @entity31 and @entity170			0
@entity130 would have admired his former student for the way he prepared his team			0
until @entity0 ’s goal , they looked the more likely winners			2
but @entity2 , rather like @entity0 at that crucial moment , have what teams need come the business end of the season : momentum			1
so much so that they almost scored again moments before the final whistle , @entity64 sending his shot against a post .			0

@entity0 scores the only goal of the game in the 68th minute at the @entity26
@entity2 move two points behind fourth - placed @entity91 with their fifth successive win
@entity130 ' side have not conceded in their last six away @entity23 matches
@entity2 face @entity94 rivals @entity91 at @entity161 on sunday
