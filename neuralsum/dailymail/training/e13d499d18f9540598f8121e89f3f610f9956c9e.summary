by @entity0 published : 14:51 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 1 october 2013 four would - be cowboys have brought the wild - west to @entity2 with their brazen robberies on horseback			1
the underage buckaroos , said to be between 13 and 16 years old , were caught on security cameras mugging two terrified women of their purses and shopping in the town of @entity10 , north east @entity11 the two elderly victims , who have just come out of the supermarket with their shopping bags , are seen cowering on the pavement and trying to run backwards as a horse trots around the corner with an accomplice running on foot behind			1
approach : the robbers turn up on their horses and come across an elderly woman standing in the doorway reaction : another women follows out of the door and they spot the teenagers trotting towards them as the women panic they drop their shopping and , while one manages to escape , the horse - back rider traps the other using his horse to herd her to the wall			1
@entity36 , the woman gives up her goods , shoving the bags into the outstretched arms of the bandit and runs for her life			0
the side - kick gathers up the loot , leaving much of it behind on the floor , then the scramble is on to saddle - up and get - away with the booty			2
but first attempts to make a ‘ giddy - up ’ escape are comical , as the accomplice is a bit of a handicap			2
he clumsily clambers onto the horse , slipping off several times and nearly dismounts the rider off the bronco			0
raising an arm as if they 've won the @entity60 , the horsemen make their get - away at a slow canter			0
run ! one of the women manages to escape by scrambling across the pavement to the other side of the road panic : one of the women drops their bags on the pavement and one of the thieves reaches down to pick it up tussle : the remaining woman tries to save her shopping but the robber has a stronger grasp minutes earlier , the security cameras had captured the start of the incident , showing the would - be posse of four buffalo bills on two mules plodding menacingly towards the two female shoppers			1
@entity86 , a housewife , who lives nearby saw the hold - up and said : ' i thought it was a joke at first with the boys on their horses just approaching the women for a laugh			1
but when i heard the women scream for help i realised it was serious			0
' according to locals , this is not the first time that the brazen bandits have attacked passers - by			1
going : the robbers begin their getaway , but have left some of the stolen shopping lying on the pavement gone : the robbers gallop down the road with the stolen handbags ' this has been happening for a while and they still have n’t been caught , ' said one local , who did n’t want to be named			0
' i hardly go out anymore because i ’m so afraid , ' said housewife , @entity115			0
' when i do go out , i ca n’t see a horse without feeling scared			0
' police say they are still looking to roundup the culprits			0
@entity10 ’s military police officer , @entity119 said : ' you can be sure that once we identify who they are they will be put in jail			2
some of the town 's residents have , however , found the episodes somewhat funny and are now calling the shopping ‘ rustlers ’ junior @entity132 bandits .			1
