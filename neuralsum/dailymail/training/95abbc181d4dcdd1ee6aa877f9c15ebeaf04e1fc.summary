former @entity1 owner sir @entity0 was satisfied but far from triumphant after further legal victory in the so - called ' big tax case '			1
a judge largely dismissed @entity6 ' appeal against a first - tier tribunal ( @entity8 ) majority verdict which decreed in november 2012 that a £ 46.2million tax demand on @entity0 's company , most of which referred to @entity1 , be ' reduced substantially '			1
the victory was qualified as @entity15 referred an unknown number of termination payments and five ' guaranteed bonus ' payments back to the original tribunal but @entity21 ( @entity21 ) scored another win			0
reaction : former @entity1 owner sir @entity0 said there ' were no winners ' in tax case the judge agreed with the argument put forward at the upper - tier tribunal ( @entity29 ) , that several other payments , including to @entity0 himself , were not special cases and fell under the @entity8 's contention that they were loans and not earnings			1
but , like the earlier ruling , the latest decision has no bearing on the @entity1 of today , the club having been relaunched in june 2012 following the destructive reign of @entity40			1
@entity21 stated that the investigation into the near - decade use of @entity43 , which stopped before they were outlawed in 2010 , had effectively put off respected potential buyers as the firm called for an ongoing police probe into @entity49 's takeover to be stepped up			0
@entity0 , apparently under pressure from his bankers to recoup a club overdraft of about £ 18million amid huge debts in his own business empire , sold @entity1 to @entity49 in may 2011 in what turned out to be the most disastrous transaction in the history of @entity59 football			1
@entity49 mortgaged future season - ticket sales to pay off the bank debt and accrued new tax debts which forced the club into administration and ultimately liquidation , after @entity6 rejected an £ 8.5million rescue deal			1
in a statement a spokesman for @entity21 said the firm was pleased with a judgement that leaves ' negligible tax liability ' , although @entity6 is considering a fresh challenge			0
victory : a judge largely dismissed @entity6 ' appeal over ' big tax case ' the spokesman added : ' the decision substantially reduces @entity6 's claim in the liquidation of the old @entity81			1
' while we have been successful in both the @entity8 and @entity29 , there are , as we have stated previously , no victors			2
' this has been an exceptionally long , difficult and expensive process involving not just the @entity8 and @entity29 but also several approaches to resolve the matter with senior @entity6 officials on a commercially sensible basis for all parties which were rejected			0
' @entity21 has , at all times , recognised that the tax tribunal proceedings stemmed from arrangements put in place during its ownership			0
they were introduced before legislative changes removed the tax efficiency of such arrangements from the end of 2010			0
' however , it is obvious that the much publicised existence of these proceedings overshadowed @entity81 for many years and tarnished the external perception of its value			0
' there can be little doubt that despite favourable legal opinion , potential acquirers were therefore dissuaded from pursuing their interest during a period in which we were marketing the sale of @entity21 's shareholding			0
' the case has also stimulated extensive press and social media comment , discussion and speculation , a significant quantity of which has been ill informed			0
exempt : the court ruling had no bearing on current @entity1 set - up ' during proceedings , it would have been entirely inappropriate for us to highlight fundamental misunderstandings or contribute to this public debate			1
' notwithstanding all of this , it is abundantly clear that @entity81 would not have gone into administration or liquidation had the purchaser fulfilled its contractual obligations and responsibilities			2
' similar to the resolution of the @entity29 appeal , we hope that the relevant authorities conclude their investigations and commence proceedings at the earliest opportunity			0
' as well as making a huge impact on the ownership of @entity1 , the @entity43 issue also raised the prospect of the club being stripped of titles over their use of ' side letters ' detailing extra-contractual payments to players that were not registered with the football authorities			1
@entity153 @entity1 were ultimately handed a meaningless £ 250,000 fine by a @entity156 - appointed commission for failing to declare payments but this issue was ruled irrelevant by the tribunal			1
lord @entity15 's ruling read : ' the appeal is dismissed except in so far as it relates to the termination payments			2
' i shall remit the case to the @entity8 ( i ) with a direction to allow the taxpayers ' appeals against the assessments relating to the payments to the sub-trusts of sir @entity0 , his sons , mr @entity173 and mr @entity174 ; ( ii ) to proceed as accords in relation to the termination payments , the payments in respect of guaranteed bonuses , and any related questions of grossing up			1
' a statement from @entity6 read : ' we are naturally disappointed with today 's decision and are considering an appeal			2
we win around 80 per cent of cases taken to litigation by taxpayers			0
' the company , @entity81 , did not go into liquidation because of this tax case			2
it 's a matter of public record that @entity1 was placed in administration by its principal shareholder and director because it was unable to pay its creditors , including @entity6			2
' @entity6 voted against the @entity197 issued by the administration			0
liquidation allows a full investigation into the conduct of the owners and financial officers which would not be possible in a cva			2
' at the time of liquidation , published court papers show that the undisputed tax that was owed by the company was approximately £ 21million			1
' this is an entirely separate issue from the amount in dispute due to the former owner 's use of the @entity43 scheme			0

@entity0 said there were ' no victors ' after court ruling
@entity1 went into liquidation in 2012 ' owing ' £ 21million '
latest decision has no bearing on the current @entity1 regime
