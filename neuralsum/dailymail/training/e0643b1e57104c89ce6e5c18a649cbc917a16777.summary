@entity0 hailed @entity2 ’s fighting qualities after they overcame a huge fright to make a winning @entity5 return			1
@entity6 held his nerve to fire in a last - gasp penalty , which secured a 2 - 1 win against @entity10 , but that was only after @entity2 had conceded a 90th minute equaliser to substitute @entity13 following another defensive mix - up			1
@entity15 had earlier opened the scoring but while he was delighted to get @entity17 off to a winning start , @entity0 admitted there was significant room for improvement in the quality of @entity2 ’s performance			1
@entity0 praised @entity2 's fighting spirit after they beat @entity25 2 - 1 at @entity26 but the @entity2 manager did say his side would have to improve tactically in the @entity5 ‘ if you can win your home games and pick up points away from home , it gives you a chance , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are not at the standard we were last season			2
we have a lot of players who have come in and are still adapting			2
we are a work in progress			2
‘ i thought we showed great determination			2
at times we had quality and then in the final third we could n’t make that final pass			2
tonight was about perseverance , an attribute you need to have			2
it is a competition that is about winning and winning games			2
sometimes you will play well and not get a result			0
‘ it was very important to be back in the competition			0
it was always going to be a tricky tie			0
technically they were very good			0
we had to show patience , change the shape from 4 - 3 - 3 to a diamond			1
@entity15 gets a great goal			1
i am disappointed with the equaliser we conceded @entity15 scored his first goal for the club after signing from @entity63 this summer it was @entity2 's first @entity5 match since they lost to @entity66 at @entity26 in 2009 ‘ but maybe in the first six months we would have drawn but we showed the experience and character in the group , the young kid ( @entity67 ) in the box pushing hard to get something and he gets his reward in the penalty that @entity72 scores			1
’ @entity15 came to life after he scored his goal , almost grabbing another with a thumping drive , and @entity0 believes the goal will do wonders for his confidence following his high profile switch from @entity63			1
‘ @entity15 is used to scoring , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he had two games when he had n’t scored			1
i just feel with him , he needs to be in the box more			0
i said to him at half - time “ make sure when the ball is in wide areas , make sure you are penalty spot and in ” ‘ he is 6ft 3ins and great in the air			1
he shows great touch and the finish was a wonderful touch			0
on top of that i thought he worked very hard			0
he is still trying to get fit but he showed us his quality			0
’ ludogorets thought they had secured an unlikley point after @entity13 scored a late equaliser after conceding an equalise in the 90th minute , @entity6 than converted a penalty to win it @entity0 , whose side now travel to @entity105 – thumped 5 - 1 by reigning champions @entity106 – on matchday two , admitted that @entity2 have to learn to concentrate until the very end if they are to achieve his target of progressing to the knockout stages			1
‘ no question , ’ he said			0
‘ i think certainly tactically there are questions asked			1
this is a tournament where mistakes get punished			0
the home games are very important for us			0
away from home you have got to be compact and impose your style on the game			0
‘ @entity26 cranks itself up in terms of the noise level on nights like this			0
