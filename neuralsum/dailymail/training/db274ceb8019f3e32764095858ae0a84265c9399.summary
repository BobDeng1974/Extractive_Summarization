the @entity0 picks up gongs for @entity2 and @entity3 for her smash hit @entity6 misses out on two more as @entity7 goes to @entity8 for get lucky and @entity9 wins best pop vocal album for @entity11 @entity13 's effortless ascension to pop royalty was cemented as she took home @entity2 and @entity3 for her smash hit the @entity6 at the @entity17 on sunday night			1
looking stunned and in awe of the whole event , the 17 - year - old star took to the stage to collect her @entity2 award saying : ' this is the one thing i did n't expect tonight			1
' but she pulled herself together to thank her fellow nominees and category losers , @entity9 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 for being inspirational vocal artist in what was unsurprisingly a typical awkward speech from a teenager			1
and she seemingly came out of nowhere in the past few months to take over the music world			2
in face she has broken records by becoming the first @entity57 solo artist to have a number one song in the @entity59 dressed in a floor - length , jet black frock with crimson lips , bold brows and tousled hair , the trend setting star looked gorgeously vampish as she took to the stage			2
' this is the one thing that i did not expect the most about tonight , ' she said			0
' thank you so much			0
i think mostly to @entity9 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
i have been so inspired by all of your vocal work at some point in my life so thank you and thank you all so much			2
it was a similarly short and sweet yet slightly awkward speech as she collected her second award of the night for @entity3 alongside producer @entity78			1
woman in black : the 17 - year - old said the award win was totally unexpected , saying : ' this is the one thing i did n't expect tonight ' nerves : the teenager was understandably nervous as she accepted her first award but powered through her brief acceptance speech @entity78 , revealing @entity13 - whose real name is @entity13 - had asked him to speak first , said : ' this is intense – we made this song originally to give away for free so to be here and in a room with all of these legends is an honour so thank you for that			0
' thanks to my wife and kids , i love you so much and to my manager i like you a lot			0
and @entity13 , i think you ’re amazing i always have			0
' @entity13 thanked @entity78 and her fans for supporting her , saying : ' thank you everyone who has let this song explode because it 's been mental			0
' endearingly awkward : it was a similarly short and sweet yet slightly awkward speech as she collected her second award of the night for @entity3 @entity109 : @entity13 praised her producer @entity78 for supporting her and helping to developing her songwriting skills what a transformation : @entity78 admitted they had planned to release the single @entity13 for free in the hope of getting some airplay for it after her brief speech , the overcome star left the stage			1
@entity13 beat @entity120 and @entity121 , @entity30 , @entity9 and @entity122 and @entity123 to take the gong			1
the gothic songstress just missed out on two more awards as @entity7 went to @entity8 's get lucky featuring @entity127 and @entity128 while @entity9 won best pop vocal album for @entity11			1
superstar : @entity13 has gone from unknown to @entity41 winner in a very short space of time the @entity0 , who skipped the red carpet , took to the stage earlier in the night in a low - key shirt and trousers and big hair to deliver her award - winning hit @entity6			1
in her signature goth style the songstress wore white face make - up , bold brows , deep crimson lippy and some freaky fingers - dip - dyed black nails			0
queen of cool : @entity13 performed her hit @entity6 at the @entity41 on sunday in @entity151 freaky fingers : the singer was sporting some unusual nail art with the ends of her fingers looking like they 'd been dipped in tar goth girl : with her dramatic white face make - up , deep purple lippy and scary dipped black nails , @entity13 looked gorgeously gothic the fashion trend setter 's unusual nail art made it look as if she 'd sunk her hands into a pot of black tar and lent an vampish edge to her ensemble			1
she blew the crowd away with her captivating rendition of the catchy track			0
. no fuss : the teen wore a simple white blouse and black trousers @entity176 : @entity13 had the audience captivated through her performance shining light : despite being just 17 the star has been firmly in the spotlight this year film noir : with her long black hair the singer looked suitably dramatic on stage with so many nominations at such a young age , @entity13 recently admitted her life has changed			0
she told @entity190 magazine : ' it 's a really weird thing to write a song like @entity6 and then go through something like this , which changes your entire world and way of living and changes what you do every day			2
' when speaking about today 's modern music , the singer also said : ' nothing is in one genre , nothing is easily defined			0
famous fans : @entity13 was joined by @entity207 for a photograph as the duo got to know each other at the @entity41 bffs : @entity13 and @entity212 have become close pals since the 17 - year - old singer found fame ' my first love is electronic music and then going to top 40 pop and hip - hop and weird pre-jazz records and taking from each of those and figuring out what was missing , what i wanted to hear in it			2
' i think that 's what people my age do ' , she said			0
the self - described feminist had been posting outlandish fashion ideas for her @entity41 gown on @entity235 - poking fun of the red carpet hullabaloo			0
excited : @entity212 was thrilled for her young pals as they caught up at the @entity41 on sunday following @entity13 's wins getting advice ? @entity13 looked slightly starstruck as she shared a giggle with @entity207 cheer up ! @entity13 poses with her two awards backstage best new artist : @entity120 & @entity243 : get @entity244 , @entity8 ft. @entity127 and @entity245 : cut @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 & @entity246 : royals , @entity251 : @entity253 , @entity255 ft. @entity254 : @entity256 , @entity257 : royals , @entity258 : stepping out , @entity260 : to be loved , @entity261 : @entity262 , @entity263 : @entity264 : re-becoming the greatness we never were n't , @entity267 , @entity268 : @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 ( @entity272 ) @entity273 : @entity274 [ @entity275 ] , @entity276 : if he did it before ... same @entity279 [ @entity275 ] , @entity280 follow her arrow : @entity283 also won two gongs @entity285 : @entity286 [ @entity275 ] , @entity287 , @entity288 : @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 : @entity293 , @entity292 : @entity294 and @entity295 , @entity296 of @entity297 : @entity298 , @entity299 : @entity300 , @entity300 , @entity301 : @entity302 : provocative in @entity303 , @entity304 : song for @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 : @entity309 : @entity310 , @entity311 ( compilation producer ) best musical theater album : @entity313 , @entity314 : @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 : my favorite @entity318 of you , @entity321 : @entity322 , @entity324 ft. @entity323 : @entity325 , @entity326 : @entity327 , @entity328 : @entity329 , @entity120 & @entity330 : @entity329 , @entity120 & @entity331 : @entity332 , @entity120 & @entity333 : something , @entity334 with @entity335 : please @entity336 , @entity337 big winners : @entity339 pose with their four awards @entity341 : @entity342 , @entity343 : @entity344 , @entity345 : @entity346 , @entity347 : @entity348 , @entity349 with @entity350 : live kisses , @entity352 : from @entity353 , the @entity354 : @entity355 , @entity356 : @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity283 & @entity359 : radioactive , imagine @entity360 : @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity268 : @entity363 : @entity364 , @entity365 : @entity366 , @entity367			1
