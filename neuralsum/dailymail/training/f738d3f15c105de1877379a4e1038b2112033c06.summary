by @entity0 even the angriest class warrior would be hard - pushed to call it luxurious			1
with the ambiance of a mid-range provincial hotel circa 1975 , it has a homely simplicity , but it is no palace on wheels			1
formica panels , @entity9 - style g - plan furniture , plastic baths and strip lights ( no chandeliers here ) would hardly lend themselves to an @entity16 - style whodunnit — unless , perhaps , one was filming murder on the @entity19			1
royal basics : prince @entity22 's sitting room aboard the @entity23 has all the ambiance of a mid-range provincial hotel circa 1975 @entity26 : a single bed offers simple unfussy accommodation for royal travellers it is also the slowest inter-city rail service in @entity32			1
but there is no other train on the planet that comes close in terms of charm , punctuality and eccentricity — let alone history			1
that is why rail buffs and trainspotters will not be the only ones dismayed by the news the @entity23 could be heading for the buffers			1
and none will be sadder than the @entity48 and her family			1
this week , sir @entity50 , the keeper of the @entity51 — the financial director of the royal household — appeared before the @entity54 on the @entity55 to discuss the state of the royal finances			1
while public finances may have ballooned , the @entity58 has managed to halve its costs over the past 20 years			1
wash and go : the @entity48 has a bath in her carriage while @entity63 prefers a shower but its admirable policy of ‘ make do and mend ’ can not go on indefinitely			1
at @entity71 , the 60 - year - old boilers are pushing up the fuel bills , the wiring has n’t been touched since @entity73 was on the throne , bits of masonry are falling off and buckets have to be strategically placed under holes in the roof			1
with all this alarming news to absorb , the @entity54 barely noticed sir @entity50 ’s additional disclosure that the @entity23 is in similar need of repair			1
in a few years , a ‘ major decision ’ will be required regarding the @entity84 rolling stock			1
and it will be an expensive one			1
‘ the figures ’ , this astute former international financier added , ‘ are quite staggering ’			1
there is no question that @entity71 and @entity91 must be properly restored			2
they are two of the most famous buildings in the world , national landmarks which belong to the nation , not the @entity48			2
but there will be less sympathy for the @entity23			1
and sir @entity50 ’s reference to the ‘ staggering ’ cost of a new one suggests that he already knows it ’s a non-starter			2
in which case , the @entity23 seems destined to follow the dear old royal yacht , @entity104 , in to retirement			1
and while that may please modernisers and republicans , royalists like me will regard it as a crying shame			2
the vast majority of royal rail journeys involve scheduled services			2
but the @entity23 has its uses			1
critics always focus on the headline figure of the train — £ 1 million a year to run , or £ 20,000 , say , for a trip to @entity121 — without acknowledging the advantages of a royal mobile home			2
it ’s extremely secure , it can accommodate all the paraphernalia of a royal tour and , unlike the alternatives , it is virtually foolproof			2
if a whole county is waiting to see the @entity48 , then a whole county will be let down if her helicopter is grounded by fog or her car gets stuck in traffic			2
thanks to the @entity23 , everyone knows that she will be in @entity137 or @entity138 or @entity139 to the nearest ten seconds ( though @entity23 drivers try to stick to a five - second margin of error )			1
as for the @entity144 themselves , it really is the proverbial home - from - home — familiar staff , a favourite armchair , the same old tea cups			2
with its distinctive royal claret coaches , the train attracts an enormous amount of attention wherever it goes an abiding memory of my only tour inside — during the 2002 @entity157 — are the boxes of @entity160 tissues on the royal tables			2
when not in use , it all sits in a large railway shed at @entity165 , near @entity166 , where a skeleton crew keep the nine claret - coloured carriages and their contents in mint condition			2
not that they are called carriages			2
they are ‘ saloons ’			2
@entity48 , the @entity63 and the @entity174 each have their own saloon while additional wagons , looking much like regular sleepers and @entity179 carriages , feed and accommodate the staff			2
there is no permanent royal locomotive , although the operator , @entity184 , will only hitch one of its classier models to the royal rolling stock			1
and since 2007 , the @entity23 is powered by eco-friendly bio-fuel			1
royal passengers sleep in single beds which run lengthways behind a partition in the centre of the carriage ( for optimum stability and a good night ’s sleep )			0
all the other bunks lie across the carriage , as in a conventional sleeper			0
the @entity48 has a bath in her carriage while the @entity63 prefers a shower — and keeps a blown - up image of his first senior citizen ’s railcard alongside a chunk of @entity208 ’s original broad gauge			0
affairs of state : @entity48 works at her desk on the @entity23 in may , 2002 the @entity48 's bedroom on an earlier , and perhaps slightly more luxurious , incarnation the @entity23 taken in 1946			1
the current train has been in service since 1977 @entity22 keeps a handmade pot - pourri holder , presented long ago by a girl in @entity218 , next to his bed and a picture of @entity104 above it			1
the similarities with @entity104 are everywhere — from the plain furniture and antiquated telephones to the absence of double beds ( if the @entity228 is on board , she has her own saloon — complete with pink bathroom )			0
as @entity232 points out in his fascinating book , @entity234 , when @entity235 became @entity236 , he stipulated it should ‘ be as much like the royal yacht as possible ’			0
the current @entity23 dates back to the @entity239			1
then , it consisted of 14 carriages for the use of all the senior members of the family			0
sometimes two trains would be in action			0
on one day in 1986 , no less than three could be seen in different parts of the country			0
by the @entity250 , cost - cutting had reduced the number of wagons to nine and royal use was restricted to the @entity48 , the @entity63 and the @entity174			0
none of them has ever been as demanding as the earliest royal passengers			0
queen @entity257 was the first monarch to board a train when she made the journey from @entity260 to @entity261 in 1842			0
@entity208 himself was on the footplate			0
to general relief , her majesty much enjoyed the experience and was soon making her mark on @entity32 ’s rail network			0
all change : the @entity48 and her corgis disembark in 1968 having decreed she would neither eat nor go to the lavatory on board , lavish ‘ refreshment ’ buildings were built along the route north to @entity121			0
@entity257 commissioned the wagons which became the first @entity23			1
while @entity278 invented the first train lavatory , @entity277 went one better and was the first person in the world to install a bath on a train			0
it was 1915 , the nation was at war and he wanted to tour @entity32 without descending on the nearest country house each night and causing mayhem			0
in time , @entity288 became a convert to the 55in bath , though she imposed a speed limit of 5mph when sitting in it			0
a full - size bath was installed in 1941 as @entity73 and @entity48 began extended wartime tours of the country by rail			0
by the end of the war , it was calculated they had travelled 63,000 miles			0
but distance is only half of the story			0
now , as then , royal passengers spend a lot of their time at a standstill			0
in order to avoid any inconvenience to regular rail services , the train will meander along branch lines and wait until the main services have ceased before taking to the major routes			1
when it is reasonably near its destination for the following morning , it then parks in a secure siding until dawn			0
the driver — drawn from a pool of 50 — will then begin a stately progress to the final destination			0
drivers pride themselves on a jolt - free ride , just as the on - board chef takes great delight in preparing the scrambled eggs and bacon exactly the way the @entity48 likes them			0
most of us will never even see inside this thing , let alone travel in it			0
but , as with @entity104 , that does not stop us taking great pride in a classic piece of romantic , understated @entity32 elegance			0
but for how much longer ? it will certainly be a sad day when there is no longer a claret - coloured saloon carrying the head of state across the nation which invented the train in the first place .			0

the current @entity23 dates back to the @entity239
but a ' major decision ' is soon *due* regarding @entity84 rolling stock
