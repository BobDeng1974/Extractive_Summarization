@entity0 has said he will feel no pressure to win when he makes his return to snooker , believing he already is triumphant just to be back playing following an intensive course of chemotherapy for lung cancer			1
the 2008 and 2012 @entity8 runner - up admits he is ' not quite out of the woods ' , but remains optimistic over his condition , so much so that he has entered the @entity12 event in @entity13 , which runs from october 3 - 5			1
it would be his first tournament since his diagnosis in may , but the 35 - year - old , who had already beaten testicular cancer last year and suffers from @entity20 's disease , is unfazed whether his comeback is a success			1
fighting back : @entity0 is heading back to the snooker table after receiving treatment for lung cancer ' this has opened my eyes a little bit because winning is not the most important thing to me now , ' he said in an interview with @entity33			1
' i feel it has taken the pressure off my shoulders having faced what i have faced and beaten what i have beaten			2
i have really got nothing to be afraid of any more			0
' of course i want to win tournaments , but really what difference does it make ? i was not thinking about tournaments i had won in hospital			0
' i would have had it taken away from me to have my health back			0
up for a fight : @entity0 is a two - time @entity8 runner - up at the @entity49 ' while i can hang on to that feeling i think there are some big things to come for me in sport			1
' @entity0 revealed he has not yet had the all - clear but is positive he will do soon			2
' i have had positive results , ' he added			2
' i am not quite out of the woods yet but i am nearly there , i have one last procedure on september 11 and then hopefully it will be job done			0
' i am nearly out the other side			0
it will be emotional for me to turn up at the masters and the @entity62 and that is what i have to look forward to			0
