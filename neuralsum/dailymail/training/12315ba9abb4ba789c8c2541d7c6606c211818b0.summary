by @entity0 it is one of the capital ’s most beautiful parks , enjoyed by thousands who visit each day to stroll through 200 acres of landscaped gardens			1
but @entity11 in @entity12 has been ‘ desecrated and despoiled ’ by travellers who left 50 tons of rubbish and filth after illegally camping there for just three days			1
the once perfectly manicured lawns have been churned up by cars , the turf of a cricket pitch destroyed and a picturesque bluebell wood transformed into a hazardous swamp of refuse – all at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of thousands of pounds			2
a local school sports day was cancelled , along with a weekend charity run , because of health and safety fears			2
police said the travellers had come to @entity12 after attending @entity48 in the @entity49 , @entity51 ’s largest gathering of the travelling community , where piles of rubbish were also left strewn in their wake			1
they are expecting more to arrive and migrate from park to park around southern @entity57			2
intimidating : one of the travellers yesterday itinerant : the community has now moved on to nearby @entity61 , pictured , and set up camp there around 70 men , women and children in 17 caravans turned up at @entity67 - listed @entity11 , the former @entity68 stately home of 19th century financier @entity69 , on sunday evening			1
then , with wilful abandon , they proceeded to destroy the much - loved grounds and terrorise park - users			2
@entity73 , which estimates the clean - up bill will exceed £ 18,000 , applied to the courts for an eviction notice			1
meanwhile , police received reports of travellers – armed with guns – trying to run over walkers in their cars and threatening to kill their dogs			1
so worrying did the situation become that , as a last resort , the park was closed on wednesday evening			2
but within a few hours the group moved to a nearby park , where they have set up camp again			1
@entity90 has now been tentatively re-opened			2
dumped : police said the travellers had come to @entity12 after attending @entity48 in the @entity49			1
they are expecting more to arrive and migrate from park to park around southern @entity57 desecrated : the once perfectly manicured lawns have been churned up by cars , the turf of a cricket pitch destroyed and a picturesque bluebell wood transformed into a hazardous swamp of refuse yesterday the travellers threatened to attack anyone caught getting too close or taking photos of their new camp – @entity61 in @entity106 , a popular children ’s play area in an affluent residential area			1
one man said to the @entity111 : ‘ if you do n’t * * * * off , i ’m going to put my * * * * * * * foot through your camera			2
i do not mind going to prison for what i will do to you			2
’ the heavily tattooed , muscular man added : ‘ you do not have a right to be here			0
i will get all my friends here , then you ’ll be sorry			0
’ the police soon arrived and asked the @entity122 and local residents to leave for their own safety			0
disrespect : around 70 men , women and children in 17 caravans turned up at @entity67 - listed @entity11 , the former @entity68 stately home of 19th century financier @entity69 , on sunday evening threatening : with abandon , they proceeded to destroy the much - loved grounds and terrorise park - users guns : police received reports of armed travellers in cars trying to run over walkers and threatening to kill dogs the legal process to remove travellers from illicit sites is a lengthy and costly one , with cash - strapped councils having to apply to the courts for eviction notices			1
@entity147 leader @entity146 said he was outraged by the actions of the travellers and wished there was a swifter way to move them			1
he said : ‘ our parks are being desecrated and despoiled			0
the beautiful green spaces around here are why people live in this glorious part of @entity12			1
it greatly angers me and it comes at such an enormous cost to the taxpayer			0
‘ this is not about there being any prejudice to the traveller way of life – in @entity106 we have a designated park where they can stay			0
it is about the mess left behind , the fly - tipping , the anti-social behaviour and intimidation of park users			0
‘ parks are there for everyone to enjoy , they are not campsites to be trashed			0
i wish we had more powers to deal with this quickly , but our hands are tied by the courts			0
’ abandoned : a school sports day was cancelled , along with a charity run , because of health and safety fears big job : a clean up crew can be seen in the background behind a sofa which lies dumped on the green space ' our parks are being desecrated and despoiled ' : an eviction notice taped to a tree in @entity11			1
@entity147 leader @entity146 , right in @entity61 , said he was outraged by the actions of the travellers police at the scene : yesterday the travellers threatened to attack anyone caught getting too close or taking photos of their new camp - @entity61 in @entity106 , a popular children 's play area in an affluent residential area @entity203 confirmed they had received several complaints of anti-social behaviour , including one of a man in a car with a gun			1
one regular dog walker said that in addition to the piles of rubbish , there was also human excrement			0
‘ one of my dogs came back from sniffing around the rubbish covered in it , ’ she said			0
‘ i walked past their “ camp ” yesterday with a few fellow dog walkers and a car with two young guys in it came speeding across the field at 30 - plus miles per hour			1
‘ i told them to slow down and just got abuse back			0
they nearly hit one of the little dogs			0
’ @entity232 : @entity11 as it usually looks a man who runs a dog walking business said : ‘ they left such a mess – piles of wood with nails in and tins of toxic paint			1
this is dangerous for dogs and other animals that live in the park , such as rabbits and squirrels			0
‘ what upsets me is not that they camped here illegally , but that they trashed the park so much			0
no one has a right to do that			0
it ’s heartbreaking to see			0
’ a police spokesman said that following the report of a man in a car with a gun , specialist armed officers had been sent to the park			0
the spokesman added : ‘ there continues to be an increased police presence in the park to provide reassurance to local people			1
