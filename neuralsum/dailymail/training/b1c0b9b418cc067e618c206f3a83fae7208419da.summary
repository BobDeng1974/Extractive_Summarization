by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 21:38 est , 7 october 2013 a millionaire property developer who lost a planning battle over two £ 15,000 lion - topped gate posts has broken his collarbone as he attempted to remove them			1
officials ruled that @entity7 , 73 , must remove the 12ft high @entity9 stone pillars outside his seven - bedroom home in the upmarket @entity13 area of @entity14 - saying they were ' out of keeping ' with the local area			1
despite vowing to fight the ' unelected officials ' who said they must be removed , mr @entity7 lost his battle and was forced to take them down			1
high price : mr @entity7 fell while trying to remove two £ 15,000 posts , topped with gold lions - pictured			1
doctors have said he will be off work for six weeks row : mr @entity7 , standing in front of the now empty plinths outside his @entity14 home , was ordered to remove the posts by council officers who said they were ' out of keeping ' with the area - the upmarket @entity13 but as he dismantled the elaborate entrance a stone dislodged , causing him to fall and break his collarbone			1
today , the property magnate said : ' i wish i had never built the pillars in the first place			2
' but i am keeping them right here in my garden where they look beautiful			2
' i managed to dislodge one of the stones with the jack hammer and i just went down with it			0
' i still do n’t know why anybody would complain about the pillars in the first place			0
' there is nothing offensive about them			0
i ca n’t see why this sort of thing is so difficult for people and the council			2
it seems like everything is a trial with them			0
former glory : the posts , installed by mr @entity7 in @entity60 last year , were 12ft tall and made from @entity9 stone ' the doctors said i will be out for six weeks , but i ca n’t wait to get back to work			1
i do n’t think i ’ll ever retire			0
' mr @entity7 moved into the expansive @entity64 , which was built in the 1840s , around 15 years ago			1
he erected the pillars outside his ten - acre plot just before @entity60			0
however , a few months after installing the pillars he received a letter from the council stating they were ' out of keeping ' with the listed 1860s house and had ' no substantial public benefit '			1
but mr @entity7 disputed the council ’s claim and said the posts were an asset , which enhanced the road			1
at the time , mr @entity7 said : ' an @entity81 's home is supposed to be his castle			2
adamant : mr @entity7 said the posts were an added asset to his listed 1860s , seven - bedroom property and none of his neighbours objected to them ' well , i live in a castle but it does n't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell me to take my pillars down			1
' i see the posts as an asset , which enhances the folly			0
i have n't met one person who does n't like them			0
' mr @entity7 instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice , a process he predicted would cost him £ 3,000			2
he added : ' i did n't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars			0
' i found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so i applied for retrospective planning and they would n't have it			0
copycat : the @entity111 to @entity113 racecourse featuring a pair of stone lions that inspired mr @entity7 's elaborate entrance , which he now has a month to remove ' they wo n't even let me speak to a conservation officer			1
the council is so draconian , trees have more rights than people here			0
' it is not like it is a block of flats i 've just built , they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul - de - sac			2
what harm will they do ? not one person has complained to me			0
' i 've lived at the home for 15 years and we 've spent thousands restoring it			0
' the councillors are a waste of time , they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say			0
the planners and politicians in @entity14 are too busy fighting each other to help the people			1
' after a lengthy appeal process mr @entity7 was finally given a month to remove the controversial pillars .			1
