polluted : young boys play in the water of @entity26 , where sailing will take place at the @entity29 trash : discarded rubbish litters the banks of @entity1 's @entity26			1
officials face a race against time to now have it cleaned up for the @entity0 next year rubbish : tyres , office seats and televisions are amongst just some of the junk that is washed up in the bay garbage : between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day , including household waste and raw sewage @entity26 , one of the iconic locations of @entity29 , is still blighted by sewage , industrial pollution and illegal dumping			1
