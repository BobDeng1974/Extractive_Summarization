' they 're not the hardened criminals that society abhors they 're just kids – they 're just generally first offenders 18 - 23 years old , so if the impression people get is that it 's not admirable way of advertising your service – that does n't have much weight			0
' ' they deserve to be presented with the best legal representation possible at an affordable price , do n't you think ? ' despite this , the firm has been slammed by critics who claim they are encouraging the use of drugs mr @entity49 added that a company with the purpose of working alongside criminals , was unlikely to find a way to effectively advertise their services in an uncontroversial manner			1
' we 're criminal lawyers – were not exactly the most loved profession in the world			0
we represent people who have been charged with criminal offences , ' he said			0
' any criminal lawyer who advertises is not going to have too many fans just by the very nature of the advertisement and the job we do			0

their @entity6 page is filled with memes and links to news articles that relate to criminal convictions , including an image of a cross-eyed puppy which reads : ' i was at the airport ; i sniffed a suitcase , that 's the last thing i remember '			0
