by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 09:46 est , 7 may 2013 @entity1 has announced it will launch an update to the latest version of its @entity4 operating system - @entity4 8 - because of complaints about how difficult the software is to use			1
the mover , seen by many as a u-turn , is part of a software package that has been given the codename , ' @entity14 '			2
however , the update wo n't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year			0
the homescreen on @entity18 is made up of interactive tiles that you use your mouse or finger to swipe across			0
this layout was designed for touchscreen devices , yet pc and mouse users have criticised it for being too difficult to use			0
many have called for a return to the desktop view as seen in previous versions of the @entity4 operating system @entity4 8 has interactive tiles and swiping menus that were designed to work best on touchscreen devices			1
@entity26 and mouse users have heavily criticised this because it is difficult to get used another common complaint has centered on the lack of a ' start ' button in the @entity18 menu			0
other critics want the system to boot up in desktop mode by default , instead of showing the mosaic of interactive tiles that you need to swipe through , and were designed to be used on touchscreen devices			0
@entity18 was released last october and was a major overhaul in terms of design , compared to previous versions			0
many users have criticised it for being too difficult to use , and the @entity14 update is expected to respond to these complaints			1
@entity57 , @entity4 ' marketing and financial chief , told the @entity61 ' key aspects ' of the software would be changed			1
' the learning curve is definitely real , ' she admitted			0
@entity1 has n't said whether it will charge existing @entity18 users to get the update , or when it will be available , although it is expected around october			1
more details about @entity14 will be released before @entity1 's developer conference in @entity68 in late june			1
some of @entity14 's features are also expected to be previewed at this conference			1
@entity1 hoped @entity18 would play a more prominent role in the growing mobile market while still maintaining its dominance in @entity26 research firm , @entity74 said @entity18 contributed to a 14 percent decline in worldwide pc sales during the first three months of the year - the biggest year - over - year drop ever			2
meanwhile , sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming			0
the biggest beneficiaries have been @entity83 , with its @entity84 and @entity85 , and @entity86 , which sells the most mobile devices running @entity90 's @entity89 software			0
@entity1 launched its first 10.6 inch tablet , called the @entity92 , last october			2
it was the first tablet to launch running a mobile version of the @entity18 operating system			0
rumours suggest that with the ' @entity14 ' update , @entity1 may be looking at releasing smaller versions of this device later this year @entity90 is also benefiting from @entity89 's popularity through increased traffic to its services			1
by contrast , leading pc makers such as @entity104 and @entity105 , which primarily sell @entity4 - powered machines , have seen a drop in sales and suffered slumps in stock values			2
despite this , @entity1 insists it 's pleased with @entity18 's performance			1
the company claims more than 100 million @entity18 licenses have been sold so far , up from about 60 million licenses in january			0
according to @entity57 , the licensing volume ' is in the same general ballpark , ' as @entity4 7 - @entity1 's previous operating system			1
sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming , while pc sales are slumping			0
according to marketing firm @entity74 , sales of the @entity85 passed 141m last year @entity57 said @entity14 is being released because @entity1 realised changes need to be made to make @entity4 8 easier to use			1
she added that @entity14 will also improve @entity4 8 's ability to work on smaller tablets with 7 - and 8 - inch display screens			1
although she declined to say whether @entity1 intends to make smaller version of its own surface tablets			1
@entity1 founder @entity132 has also predicted that the company 's fortunes will be buoyed by @entity85 users switching to @entity18 tablets			1
during an interview with @entity138 , @entity132 said : ' users of @entity85 and @entity89 tablets might not have noticed , but a lot of them are ' frustrated ' because they ' ca n't type , they ca n't create documents , they do n't have [ @entity1 ] office there			2
' since april 2012 , @entity85 sales have passed 141m			0
according to market intelligence firm @entity74 , total tablet sales have reached 253m , and less than 2m of those are for @entity1 's surface tablet			1
analysts say one reason @entity18 got off to a slow start is because there were n't enough devices designed to take advantage of the system 's touch - screen features			0
@entity157 , managing director of specialist it consultancy , @entity158 , added : ' @entity18 was a failure of timing , not of design			0
@entity132 , the founder of the @entity1 , believes that many @entity85 users are ' frustrated '			2
he claims that because they ca n't type on their tablets , they will ultimately switch to devices running @entity167 and @entity18 , such as the company 's surface tablet which launched last october ' @entity1 has set itself up in 2013 as a source of creativity and innovation , the problem is that the new vibe does n’t yet gel with what users know and expect from the brand			1
' on this occasion @entity1 pushed the envelope too much , but the time for these innovations will come			2
' it ’s important that @entity1 keeps doing what it ’s doing to provide a challenge to @entity83 ’s creative dominance			2
' given how different that @entity18 is from its predecessors , @entity57 said @entity1 always knew it might have to make some adjustments less than a year after the software came out			2
' it had to be a very big change to take advantage of the mobile opportunity , ' she said			0
' as we look at @entity18 , it 's important to remember a lot of its full potential wo n't be realised until there are more touch devices on the market , ' @entity57 said .			0

@entity14 will make @entity4 8 easier to use after critics *slammed* it for being too *complicated*
marketing boss admits ' key aspects ' will be changed
the blue update is expected to preview at @entity1 's developer conference in @entity68 in june
release date and cost are yet to be announced
