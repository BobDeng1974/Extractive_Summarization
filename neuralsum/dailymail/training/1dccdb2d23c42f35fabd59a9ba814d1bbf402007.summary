@entity0 personally approved the decision to axe two of @entity4 ’s senior advisers from the @entity6 candidates list , the @entity7 can reveal			0
senior sources say the prime minister ‘ signed off ’ a recommendation from party chairman @entity11 to suspend the taxpayer - funded aides as prospective mps			1
the move was ostensibly to punish them for their refusal to take part in campaigning in the @entity24 and @entity25 by - election , since they believed canvassing was a breach of @entity23 rules			1
he added : ‘ i ca n’t see that this is a proper way for a party to behave			0
’ the steely home secretary , who is expected to run for the leadership if the @entity44 lose the general election and mr @entity0 quits , is understood to be backing her aides			1

another of the home secretary ’s advisers , @entity60 , was forced to quit over the summer in a row over extremism in schools			1

’ @entity36 ( pictured ) , the home secretary 's most senior aide , was blocked from running in a safe @entity6 seat at the general election mr @entity0 ’s most senior civil servant , cabinet secretary sir @entity84 , was dragged further into the row yesterday as @entity86 demanded to know what advice his office had given on campaigning by ministerial aides			1
the official code of conduct for special advisers says that as public servants , they should not conduct canvassing in by - election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so			1
previous advice from the mr @entity0 ’s political private secretary , @entity100 , was that they could use their spare time to stuff envelopes or do ‘ back - room ’ work during a campaign			2
