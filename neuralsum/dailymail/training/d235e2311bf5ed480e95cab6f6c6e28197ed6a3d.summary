researchers found people who handled receipts printed on thermal paper continuously for two hours , without gloves , had an increase in urine bisphenol a ( @entity17 ) concentrations			1
meanwhile , those who wore gloves to hold the paper experienced no significant rise			1
risk : cash machine receipts may be exposing people to bisphenol a ( @entity17 ) , warns a new study			0
people who handled receipts printed on thermal paper for two hours without gloves had an increase in @entity17 concentrations human exposure to @entity17 has been previously linked with health concerns , including an adverse impact on reproductive function in adults and brain development in children			1
@entity17 is used in clear , hard plastic such as babies ' bottles , the lining of canned food , but it is also used in thermal receipt paper , which is handled daily by many people at locations , such as supermarkets , bank machines and petrol stations			1
the coating , which is heat sensitive , can be transferred to skin with handling , according to the study published in the health journal @entity55			0
doctor @entity56 , of @entity57 in the @entity58 , and her colleagues examined the effect of handling thermal receipts on urine bpa levels			0
hidden : @entity17 is also used in clear , hard plastic , such as babies ' bottles ( left ) , and the lining of canned food ( right ) they recruited 24 volunteers who provided urine samples before and after handling - with or without gloves - receipts printed on thermal paper for a continuous two hours			1
@entity17 was detected in 83 per cent of urine samples at the beginning of the study and in 100 per cent of samples after handling receipts without gloves			2
the researchers observed an increase in urinary bpa concentrations after continuously handling receipts for two hours without gloves , but no significant increase when the participants used gloves			2
handling : thermal receipt paper is handled daily at numerous locations , such as supermarkets ( file picture ) the clinical implications of the height of the peak level and of chronic exposure are unknown , according to the researchers			0
however , they may be particularly relevant to people exposed via their jobs , such as cashiers who handle receipts 40 or more hours per week			0
dr @entity56 added : ' a larger study is needed to confirm our findings and evaluate the clinical implications			0

bank receipts may expose people to bisphenol a ( @entity17 ) , says a new study
handling receipts printed on thermal paper increased bpa concentrations
but those who wore gloves to hold paper experienced no significant rise
@entity17 exposure previously linked to *fertility* and *infants* ' brain development
chemical is also found in hard plastic , like babies ' bottles , and tinned food
