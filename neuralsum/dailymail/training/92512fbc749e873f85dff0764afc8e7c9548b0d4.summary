rio governor @entity182 reportedly favours the proposal but it needs to clear several more legislative hurdles			0
mr @entity182 characterized the city 's fight against criminality as ' a war			0
' rio state 's top security official , @entity189 , has responded to the spike in crime by beefing up the number of officers who will be on duty during the june 12 to july 13 @entity14 by around 20 per cent			1
the spike in crime comes despite a six - year - old ' pacification ' programme which has brought police to ' favela ' shantytowns			1
the campaign initially saw crime fall , and @entity4 residents began taking walks after dark again			1
but the resurgence in crime is driving many back into a siege mentality and fueling fears of problems when an estimated 600,000 foreigners travel to @entity11 for the @entity14			0

repeated industrial action by the very men and women who are supposed to be keeping @entity4 's streets safe has not helped			2
however , it is only the civil police who will not be working today			1
@entity11 's highly armed military police , who patrol the streets , and its federal police , in charge of borders and airports promise they are not planning any strike until after the @entity14			0

comes as warnings issued to football fans visiting the country next month
rio public transport is particularly dangerous , with a surge in robberies
be aware of your surroundings and what area you are in . the @entity435 notes on its *website* that ' public transportation hubs , hotel *sectors* , and tourist areas are the locations with the highest crime rates . '
avoid wearing *flashy* *jewellery* - or any at all .
take special care when using a *smartphone* in public . avoid using it on public transport . if you need to make or take a call , step off the street and into a store .
violent protests have rocked @entity4 , @entity75 and other cities in the past year . be aware of any planned protests and avoid them .
if you are mugged - do n't react , just hand over your belongings . criminals often kill targets that resist muggings .
report crimes to the nearest police *precinct* .
