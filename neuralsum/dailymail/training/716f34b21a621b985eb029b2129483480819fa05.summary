a 13,000 - year - old bone fragment with an engraving of a mammoth or mastodon has been found in @entity4			1
scientists believe the etching is the oldest , and only known , example of @entity9 art to depict a proboscidean - or an animal with a trunk - in the @entity12			2
the bone was found in @entity14 by amateur fossil hunter @entity15 , who later discovered the engraving while cleaning it			1
researchers claim it is evidence that people living in the @entity12 during the last @entity9 created artistic images of the animals they hunted			0
evidence : scientists believe this etching is the oldest , and only known , example of @entity9 art to depict an animal with a trunk in the @entity12			0
it on a bone recently found on a @entity4 beach the engraving is at least 13,000 years old - this is the date of the last appearance of these animals in eastern @entity34 , and more recent @entity36 people would not have seen a mammoth or mastodon to draw			1
researcher @entity39 , of the @entity40 , said : ' this is an incredibly exciting discovery			0
' there are hundreds of depictions of proboscideans on cave walls and carved into bones in @entity47 , but none from @entity34 - until now			0
' the engraving is three - inches long from the top of the head to the tip of the tail , and 1.75inches tall from the top of the head to the bottom of the right foreleg			1
the fossil bone is a fragment from a long bone of a large mammal - most likely either a mammoth or mastodon , or less likely a giant sloth			1
a precise identification was not possible because of the bone 's fragmented condition and lack of diagnostic features			1
lead researcher @entity69 , of the @entity70 , said : ' the results of this investigation are an excellent example of the value of interdisciplinary research and cooperation among scientists			0
' there was considerable scepticism expressed about the authenticity of the incising on the bone until it was examined exhaustively by archaeologists , paleontologists , forensic anthropologists , materials science engineers and artists			2
' the bone was found in @entity14 by amateur fossil hunter @entity15 , who later discovered the engraving while cleaning it one of the main goals for the scientists was to investigate the timing of the engraving - was it ancient or was it recently engraved to mimic an example of prehistoric art ? it was originally found near a location , known as the @entity101 site , where human bones were discovered side - by - side with the bones of extinct @entity9 animals in an excavation from 1913 to 1916			1
the team examined the elemental composition of the engraved bone and others from the @entity101 site			2
they also used optical and electron microscopy , which showed no discontinuity in colouration between the carved grooves and the surrounding material			0
this indicated that both surfaces aged simultaneously and that the edges of the carving were worn and showed no signs of being carved recently or that the grooves were made with metal tools			0
the team 's research also further validates the findings of geologist @entity127 at the @entity128 in the early twentieth century			0
his claims that people were in @entity34 and hunted animals at @entity14 during the last @entity9 have been disputed over the past 95 years			2
a cast of the carved fossil bone is now part of an exhibit of @entity136 and @entity137 at the @entity138 in @entity139			1
the team 's research is published in the @entity141 .			0

bone fragment with engraving is believed to be at least 13,000 years old
it was found by an amateur fossil hunter on a @entity4 beach
