on may 13 2012 , during a routine fixture between @entity5 and @entity6 on the final day of the @entity8 season , @entity1 ’s journey into @entity3 football began			1
up in the stands , @entity10 ’s former chairman @entity9 was on a scouting mission to watch @entity13 , who was on loan at @entity5 , with manager @entity15			0
there was a touchline aura about @entity1 that convinced @entity9 to make further enquiries about this @entity20 coach			1
in it he had borrowed ideas from @entity33 ’s high - tempo pressing game			2
@entity9 wanted his aspirational @entity10 , just promoted to the @entity34 , to adopt the same tactics			0
@entity1 , who is close friends with former @entity33 defender @entity37 , was sold on the idea			1
in time there may yet be a role for the @entity33 great at @entity42			1
@entity9 ’s departure — the pair have not spoken since the executive chairman left abruptly in january — created an excuse for @entity1 and his star players to agitate for moves elsewhere			1
happy man : @entity22 chairman @entity51 believes @entity1 will bring back attacking football in april , @entity53 , the bellicose agent of @entity54 , touted @entity1 around @entity55 to @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
the @entity10 manager travelled to the @entity60 for the @entity62 quarter - final first leg against @entity63 , ostensibly on a scouting mission			0
everybody knew why he was really there			0
had @entity67 failed to win @entity68 , the @entity70 owners of @entity73 football ’s emerging superpower would have replaced him at the end of the season with @entity1			1
it was a mighty close call			2
he earned £ 2m a year at @entity78 ’s and will earn substantially more now he has a five - year contract as @entity22 ’s latest manager			1
last week , when @entity22 realised that their principal target @entity82 would be staying at @entity83 regardless of the result in the @entity62 final , frantic phone calls began			1
the scales were delicately balanced between @entity87 and his four successive titles with @entity89 and the credentials of up - and - coming @entity1			1
@entity22 executives called pretty much anyone who had ever come into contact with @entity1 as part of their due diligence			1
virtually all of them said the job had come too soon in the 42 - year - old ’s managerial career			2
but @entity22 chairman @entity51 pressed ahead			1
back then : @entity1 brings down @entity102 in the 2002 @entity104 finals @entity1 undoubtedly has special talents , particularly his relationship with young players			1
the expectation is that @entity22 ’s £ 30million record signing @entity110 , injured for most of last season , will respond to his compatriot ’s ideas			1
the @entity20 ’s training sessions are meticulously planned and he is usually stationed in the centre of the pitch making demands of his players — in perfect @entity3			0
though @entity1 is credited with the recruitment and development of @entity10 ’s young stars , most of that was taken care of by @entity9 and the club ’s head of recruitment , @entity125			1
the arrival of @entity129 from @entity130 last summer for £ 7m came after one of the most sophisticated analytical checks in club history			2
@entity129 is now worth three times that fee			0
the golden rule at @entity22 is to make sure you never humiliate the chairman @entity51			1
embarrass him by losing 6 - 0 at @entity140 or 5 - 0 at home to @entity142 ( below ) or three times in a season to @entity145 and your job will be on the line			0
one of @entity1 ’s priorities is to shore up a defence that leaked 51 goals in the @entity34 last season — 23 of them at @entity42			1
he must convince poor @entity152 , probably the best keeper in the division last season , to stick it out for another season			0
there is an issue in every area of @entity22 ’s defence and @entity1 must decide whether to let @entity162 leave for @entity163 or keep him another year			1
fellow @entity20 @entity110 , who barely played a game under @entity165 and @entity166 because of an injury , must come good next season			1
the indications are that @entity110 wants to prove himself			2
up front @entity1 must get @entity170 , a notoriously difficult character , onside			2
that will not be @entity174 wants to bring in @entity175 , but the @entity176 forward still prefers a move to @entity142 to play @entity62 football			0
that was n't the problem ! @entity170 and @entity181 were excellent going forward last year major blow : @entity10 could now lose the likes of @entity184 , @entity175 and @entity185 in the manager ’s office at @entity10 ’s @entity192 training ground , industrial - sized boxes of mate , the caffeine - rich tea that is a staple in @entity20 , would be delivered to @entity1 and his staff , who drinks gallons of it			2
@entity1 would often invite one of his favourite players , such as left back @entity198 , to shoot the breeze			2
@entity198 , a young , impressionable player , gets on brilliantly with the man who has left @entity78 ’s			0
@entity175 and @entity129 are in the same category			0
but it has emerged that at @entity10 , there were two distinct categories of player , with the favoured few appearing to be given preferential treatment by the manager			0
there was evidence of this at @entity5 too , where one of his former players shone a light on the way @entity1 handled players at a club he left in november 2012			2
time to go : @entity22 fans were glad to see the back of @entity166 as manager ‘ he wanted to control everything , ’ claimed former @entity5 midfielder @entity222			2
‘ the first season was fine			0
he ’d been a player and he understood , but then things changed			0
‘ he seemed to see conspiracy where there was none , and some good people had to leave by the back door			0
he wanted everyone to dance to his tune , for people to be entirely committed to him			0
the atmosphere ended up not being so good			0
but in purely sporting terms there was no problem			0
he got great results and we played well			0
’ those who have worked with him claim @entity1 , who played at the 2002 @entity104 , is high maintenance			1
he sulks if results go against him and was spending less time on the training field towards the end of last season			0
by then , this ambitious man had decided to leave @entity10			0
it ’s @entity22 , as ever , who have gambled on him .			2

many said the job had come too soon for @entity1 , but @entity51 pressed ahead
@entity110 , the £ 30million record signing , may respond to his compatriot *'s* idea
but those who worked with @entity1 claim he is high maintenance , and @entity22 have made a gamble
close friend @entity37 could join @entity1 at @entity42
