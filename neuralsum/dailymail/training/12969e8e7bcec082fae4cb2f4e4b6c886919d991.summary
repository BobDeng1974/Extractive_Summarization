like the smaller version of the new @entity30 6 , the ' @entity11 ' has a 4.7 - inch screen			1
the £ 10,700 phone also has 13 - megapixel camera , for those selfies in the back of your @entity36 , a 64gb hard - drive and a battery with a talktime life of up to 15 hours 30 minutes			1
the £ 224,000 @entity40 , which will be officially unveiled at the @entity42 next month but in case customers feel that 's a slightly inflated price for a mobile handset , it also comes with its own concierge service			0
so if you 're sitting in the back of your @entity13 ( chauffeur driven of course ) and suddenly realise you need a holiday to the @entity53 - no need to squint at the screen			2
a quick call to your personal butler and all will be arranged for you			0
the new @entity58 6 and @entity59 cost a relative snip at £ 539 and £ 619 the luxury phone , launched at the global headquarters of @entity13 in @entity63 today , is the perfect @entity65 gift for the man who has it all ( other than , perhaps , a grip on reality )			0
@entity70 , from the luxury car firm , said : ' the partnership between @entity13 and @entity11 allows customers to experience the @entity13 brand while out of the driving seat			2

' @entity92 , boss of @entity11 , added : ' the new @entity11 for @entity13 handset combines @entity95 handcraftsmanship , contemporary elegance , outstanding performance and cutting - edge technology			1
' but for those who do n't rate handcraftmanship top of the list of necessities for their mobile phone , there 's always your local @entity105 .			0
