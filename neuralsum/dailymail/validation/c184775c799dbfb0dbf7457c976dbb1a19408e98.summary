a husband and wife were today found guilty of stashing some £ 50million worth of stolen @entity3 art treasures in their garage for almost 40 years			1
@entity5 , 74 , and @entity6 , 73 , were given a suspended prison sentence of two years by a court in the @entity11 @entity10 town of @entity12			1
both had insisted that they were all ' presents ' from the legendary @entity15 artist , but the court found they were ' fraudulently obtained ' and ordered them to be returned to his family			1
@entity5 ( right ) and his wife @entity6 wait for the verdict of their trial			2
the court today found the couple were found guilty of stashing the ' fraudulently obtained ' artwork the couple address the media following the verdict , in which they were ordered to return the @entity3 treasures and given a suspended prison sentence of two years it was in november 2010 that 271 lithographs , cubist paintings , notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in @entity36 , in the @entity37			1
but six of @entity3 's descendants accused them of the crime , and will now take charge of the works			2
during the trial , all 271 works , created between 1900 and 1932 , were beamed onto a giant screen inside the court			2
@entity5 claimed he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife , @entity49 , when he was an odd job man at their home in @entity52 in @entity53 , near @entity54			1
@entity5 , a qualified electrician , installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973 , and said he accepted them as ' thank you ' gifts			2
referring to @entity3 , mr @entity5 said he ' often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee			1
me and the master talked about all things great and small			0
' one evening , i was leaving my work , when @entity67 handed me a little package saying : ' this is for you '			0
but @entity3 , the artist 's son , said that his father was noted for his generosity , but that he always dedicated , dated and signed his gifts , as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day			0
two of the newly discovered @entity3 drawings , one in a notebook ( above left ) , and the other called ' @entity79 ' ( @entity80 ) @entity81 , @entity3 's barrister , said : ' they do n't remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970 , 71 or 72			1
if you are given @entity86 , you remember it			0
' you have to imagine that @entity3 kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away			1
that 's does n't make sense			0
' the only document with the name @entity5 on is a signed brochure for a @entity3 exhibition , said mr @entity81			1
' when you give a present , you choose something precise that fits the person , ' said mr @entity81			0
' @entity3 here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production , ' he said			2
the couple listen to judge @entity107 give the verdict at a court in @entity12 , southeast @entity11 @entity3 's son @entity111 ( left ) and daughter @entity110 sit in the courtroom today awaiting the verdict another @entity3 drawing , this time of a horse , from @entity5 's collection that he kept in his garage ' but also two notebooks of drawings , work tools that he would never have given away			1
the issue is not whether @entity3 was generous or not			0
@entity3 was n't someone who was careless about his works – he did n't give work away just for the sake of it			0
' @entity127 - @entity126 , lawyer for the couple , said the works came from the artist 's ' @entity131 ' studio on @entity134 's @entity133			0
he said that mr @entity5 would never have stolen from the @entity3 's villa , describing it as a ' fortress ' watched over night and day by security guards			1
the trial comes after @entity140 , the artist 's granddaughter , said she was selling of the famous villa , along with a selection of his work , for up to £ 190m			0
ms @entity140 wrote a memoir ' @entity3 : my @entity146 ' in 2001 , in which she accused him of destroying her childhood			0
@entity3 's works are the most stolen of any artist in history			2
he has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully , missing or disputed			0
a painting of a hand by @entity3 that was among 271 undocumented , never - before - seen works estimated to be worth at least £ 50million a painting ' still life glass sand ' and a drawing ' @entity161 ( sitting nude ) ' which feature among the 271 hitherto unseen works by @entity3 produced by the artist 's odd job man			1

in 2010 , a @entity11 couple revealed they possessed 271 @entity3 artworks
@entity5 and @entity170 claimed he had given them the collection
in a @entity11 court today the couple were *convicted* of *concealing* stolen art
the court found they had *concealed* art that was ' fraudulently obtained '
they received two - years suspended sentence and ordered to return items
