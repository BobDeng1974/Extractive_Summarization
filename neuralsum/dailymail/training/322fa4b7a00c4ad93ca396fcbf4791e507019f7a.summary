@entity0 today quoted a little - noticed december 2013 federal court ruling as evidence of a ' catch and release ' immigration policy that the @entity6 administration uses to encourage a flood of illegal migrants to the @entity9 from the south			1
one congressman told @entity12 on tuesday that federal judge @entity13 called out the @entity6 administration for aiding and abetting felonies			1
and a former lawmaker wrote that the decision shows how the @entity17 is rolling out the welcome mat for human traffickers			0
as many as 80,000 children , many traveling with human traffickers but without their parents , are expected to cross the southern @entity9 border illegally in 2014			1
he wrote in the case of a 10 - year - old @entity27 girl smuggled in the the @entity9 that the @entity28 is essentially ' delivering the minors to the custody of the parent illegally living in the @entity9 ' – even when @entity33 agents arrest the ' coyotes ' who sneak them in			1
' these actions are both dangerous and unconscionable , ' @entity13 wrote			0
' the @entity28 has simply chosen not to enforce the @entity9 ' border security laws			1
' traveling alone : 14 - year - old @entity38 from @entity39 , @entity40 , came to the @entity9 - @entity42 border by himself , reacting to false claims that young immigrant children can be reunited with family members in the @entity9 buses carrying children have been pouring into a border patrol facility in @entity50 , @entity51 , with authorities rushing to staff and supply makeshift holding facilities for all the minors who turn up in border sweeps last week photos leaked from a temporary detention facility in @entity59 showed hundreds of children crammed into holding rooms , without their parents , as @entity63 agents processed them			1
after they 're fingerprinted and given case numbers , most are turned over to other government agencies or released outright to parents who have no legal basis for being in the @entity9 and ' since most border violators are not caught , the actual numbers arriving presumably are far larger , ' former @entity70 @entity0 congressman @entity69 wrote tuesday in a @entity74 essay			1
critics say the @entity6 administration is turning an already porous border into a sieve on purpose			1
' this is a crisis of the federal government ’s creation , ' @entity51 gov. @entity80 said in a statement , ' and the fact that the border remains unsecure – now apparently intentionally - while this operation continues full - steam ahead is deplorable			2
' ' @entity94 ’s order is a must - read for everyone trying to understand the roots of today ’s " humanitarian crisis " of children being smuggled into the @entity9 , ' he added			2
' when more people learn the truth , they will hold president @entity6 accountable [ for ] ... creating human tragedy and suffering			0
' @entity51 rep. @entity99 , a @entity0 whose state is housing hundreds of illegal immigrant children in a makeshift holding facility in the town of @entity50 , told @entity12 that @entity13 ' issued an astute , neutral and accurate decision on the gross incompetence and potential illegal activities engaged in by the federal government			1
' ' when i first learned that the federal government was opening the @entity59 border and allowing thousands of illegal aliens into the country , and then transporting them across state lines only to abandon them destitute , homeless and dependent , i believed then this constituted a felony – alien smuggling and human trafficking , ' @entity99 explained in an email			1
' @entity94 agrees ... finding that the @entity28 has in fact been a criminal participant in human trafficking			1
' rep. @entity124 , a @entity125 @entity0 , told @entity12 that ' the @entity6 administration has acknowledged the surging number of children crossing the border illegally , ' but ' by failing to enforce current immigration laws , its policies have only exacerbated the crisis			1
' ' president @entity6 ’s non-enforcement doctrine has perpetuated illegal border crossing – without fear of reprisal – and encourages risking children ’s lives to illegally cross the border , ' said @entity124			1
overflowing : the shelter at @entity140 in @entity59 can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids , forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to @entity50 for processing many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger @entity13 's scathing ruling documented a guilty plea from human trafficker @entity153 , who was paid to bring the 10 - year - old girl to @entity155 but never got past a checkpoint in @entity157 , @entity59			1
she was already a felon convicted of food stamp fraud in 2011			0
the girl 's mother , @entity159 , lives illegally in @entity155			0
she paid @entity153 to fetch her daughter and smuggler her across the border			0
' @entity159 admitted that she started this conspiracy by hiring alien smugglers to transfer her child from @entity27 to @entity155 , ' @entity13 wrote			2
' she agreed to pay $ 8500 ( and actually paid $ 6,000 in advance ) for these human traffickers to smuggle her daughter )			0
' the criminal conspiracy instigated by @entity159 was temporarily interrupted when @entity153 was arrested , ' but ' [ d ] espite this setback , the goal of the conspiracy was successfully completed thanks to the @entity173			0
' @entity175 , he notes , was never the subject of any criminal proceedings			0
@entity28 ' did not arrest her			0
it did not prosecute her			0
it did not even initiate deportation proceedings for her , ' @entity13 wrote			0
it is ' completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the @entity9			2
' those criminal missions include drug - smuggling plots : @entity42 and @entity188 narcotics cartels control much of the human trafficking , using both the coyotes and their immigrant cargo as drug mules during crossings			1
' the irony , says @entity69 , ' is that the @entity17 claims the children are fleeing the dangers of organized crime in @entity198 – the very organized crime being trusted and paid to transport them to the @entity9 president @entity6 , he claims , ' denounces the situation as a " humanitarian crisis " as though he were not a perpetrator in creating it			2
' status unknown : @entity205 , left , and her son @entity206 of @entity27 , were arrested in @entity59 but later released and transported to a bus station in @entity51 ' when more people learn the truth , they will hold president @entity6 accountable , ' insists rep. @entity99 , whose home state of @entity51 has become overrun by children crossing the @entity9 - @entity42 border @entity6 himself likely sparked the mass migration from @entity198 and @entity42 , according to former @entity218 judge @entity217			1
@entity217 said monday night on the @entity219 that ' the president of the @entity9 personally and directly caused this with a telephone and a pen , ' referring to @entity6 's favorite aphorism for ' executive actions ' that he has taken without the say - so of @entity226			2
the president flexed his pen in 2012 with a high - profile order that relaxed deportations for potentially millions of illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity9 as children before june 2007			2
but news reports indicate that human traffickers are purposely misinterpreting @entity6 's action , telling families in @entity198 that the rule applies to them			2
@entity238 , a mother who crossed the border illegally with her six - year - old daughter , told @entity241 in south @entity59 that the message being disseminated in @entity243 is , ' go to @entity198 with your child , you wo n't be turned away			2
' spark : president @entity6 announced in june 2012 that he was relaxing deportation for people who came to the @entity9 illegally as children before 2007 -- but human traffickers are telling @entity253 children that the new rule will apply to them ' word has gotten out , ' @entity256 local vice president @entity255 told the @entity258 , ' that we ’re giving people permission and walking them out the door ' after they 're processed			1
' so they ’re coming across in droves			0
' the @entity17 has carefully disputed the idea that @entity6 's 2012 amnesty proposal , which he extended on june 5 , is to blame			0
' we have heard sort of rumors and reports , or suggestions , that the increase may be in response to the perception that children would be allowed to stay or that immigration reform would in some way benefit these children , ' @entity266 director @entity265 told reporters during a conference call on monday			0
' it seems to be quite clear that what is driving this is what ’s happening in their home countries			0
' but immigrants sneaking into @entity198 seem pre-armed with expectations about how the @entity6 administration will welcome them			2
if you make it , they take you to a shelter and take care of you and let you have permission to stay , ' 13 - year - old @entity290 told the @entity74 after he was apprehended by @entity296 and @entity33			0
' when you appeal your case , if you say you want to study , they support you			0
' @entity299 , the newly minted @entity28 secretary , announced the two - year extension of @entity6 's mini-amnesty program on thursday			1
' despite the acrimony and partisanship that now exists in @entity305 , almost all of us agree that a child who crossed our border illegally with a parent , or in search of a parent or a better life , was not making an adult choice to break our laws , ' @entity299 said , ' and should be treated differently than adult law - breakers			0

federal judge @entity13 called out the @entity6 administration in december for ' aiding and abetting felonies '
the @entity28 , he wrote in a scathing decision , ' has simply chosen not to enforce the @entity9 ' border security laws '
@entity0 are playing a game of ' we - told - you - so , ' seizing on @entity13 's ruling to claim that the @entity6 administration is encouraging a flood of illegal immigration , especially among children
one congressman says the @entity6 administration is intentionally participating in ' a felony – alien smuggling and human trafficking '
as many as 80,000 illegal immigrant children , many traveling alone , are expected to be apprehended crossing the @entity9 border this year
