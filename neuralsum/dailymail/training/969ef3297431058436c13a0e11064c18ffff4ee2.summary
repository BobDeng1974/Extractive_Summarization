so @entity1 ’s time in @entity3 football is over and i am glad he is heading to @entity5			1
i have said in these pages before that i do n’t like to see players who are on big contracts sitting on the bench and hopefully a move to the @entity12 will revive his confidence			0
when @entity1 joined us at @entity17 in 2007 , he was in the top four strikers in world football			1
big , strong and quick , he used to leave defenders trailing and his goal return was magnificent			0
he would stand up to defenders and was never someone who could be bullied out of a game			0
he could give as good as he got			0
the @entity28 who joined @entity26 in january 2011 , though , was not the same forward who arrived from @entity56 and we had seen the deterioration in him over his final 18 months at @entity59			1
lethal : @entity1 scored 81 goals in 142 games during his three and a half years at @entity17 strike : @entity1 holds off @entity63 to score in a 2 - 0 win over @entity65 at @entity59 in 2009 dry : the @entity33 only managed 45 goals for @entity26 after a £ 50m move to @entity69 slowing down : @entity1 ' pace was one of his biggest assets during his time at @entity17 he suffered some knee and hamstring injuries and when explosive players like him are hindered by such problems , it is difficult to recapture the spark			1
so much of @entity1 ’s game was based on his pace and he found himself unable to race away from defenders as he used to			0
people wondered why he could n’t do for @entity26 what he had initially done for @entity17 but we were never surprised			2
if anything , we were pleased with the £ 50million transfer fee we received for him , even if we did n’t reinvest it properly			2
appearances : 142 goals : 81 goals per game ratio : 1.8 matches cost per goal ( signed for £ 24m ) : £ 296,000 appearances : 172 goals : 45 goals per game ratio : 3.8 matches cost per goal ( signed for £ 50m ) : £ 1.1m @entity1 might not have scaled the heights that were expected of him in @entity100 but he still leaves with a collection of some of the game ’s biggest medals			1
it will be interesting to see if a switch to @entity107 revives his goalscoring talent .			0

@entity1 will move to @entity5 on two - year loan deal
