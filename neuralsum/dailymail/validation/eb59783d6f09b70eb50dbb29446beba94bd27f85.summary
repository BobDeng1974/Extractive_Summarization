@entity0 will describe the ' greatest challenge to our collective security for decades ' today @entity5 faces the ‘ greatest challenge ’ to national security in decades , the foreign secretary will warn today			1
@entity0 will say evolving threats from a subversive @entity9 and the spread of @entity12 extremism must be stopped before they harm the @entity5			1
in a speech at the @entity15 , the former defence secretary will say no - one can ‘ confidently and accurately ’ predict the source of the next major threat the @entity5 faces			1
but intelligence agencies must be able to secretly identify , monitor and act against the range of threats in order to thwart terror plots and uncover clandestine weapons systems under development by the enemy			2
in a damning assessment of the dangers facing @entity5 , mr @entity0 will say : ‘ … the sheer number and range of cases , old and new , amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe			1
’ he will say the country is now faced with a @entity9 leader ‘ bent ’ on subverting the international rules - based system which keeps the peace between nations			2
‘ president @entity46 ’s actions … fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in @entity49 ’ , he will say			1
@entity5 is being forced to cope with a greater range of threats , from state - sponsored aggression , to international terrorist organisations , to ‘ lone wolf ’ self - radicalised terrorists with the intent on damaging @entity5 national security			1
the emergence of groups such as @entity60 in @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 serves to underline the ‘ pace ’ with which the threats to @entity5 ’s safety and security are ‘ evolving ’ , he will claim			2
mr @entity0 will throw his weight behind plans for new laws to force internet companies to store email , web and social media records so they can be accessed by the security and intelligence agencies			1
the former defence secretary will describe @entity46 's actions as having ' undermined ' the security of sovereign nations he will say : ‘ we must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment – and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe			1
’ the security services warn that the law is failing to keep up with changing technology so their ability to track terrorists online is constantly diminishing			0
he will add : ‘ as the range of threats gets bigger , so the pace of technological change with which the agencies must keep up is getting faster , making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding			0
’ he will also speak of ' warped ' view human rights activists have taken on the case of jihadi @entity109 the clandestine nature of some of the threats launched against us ‘ require that we maintain a highly effective , secret capability to identify , monitor , and act against these threats before they can do us harm ’ , he will say			0
these include ‘ the weapons systems that are developed in secrecy to threaten our national security ...			0
and the great lengths that individual terrorists or terrorist organisations go to in order to try and keep their plots from being uncovered ’			0
the head of the @entity129 , @entity128 , has warned that ‘ if parts of the radar go dark ’ and terrorists are beyond the reach of his agency , @entity5 would be more vulnerable to attack			2
@entity137 plans for new laws to require firms to store data on internet communications , so they can be accessed as part of an investigation , were blocked by the @entity144 who brand them a ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’			0
but @entity149 has pledged to revive them if this @entity151 are re-elected			0
intelligence gathered by the @entity5 security services has already been instrumental in helping the @entity5 counter the threat from extremists and identifying targets for building effective sanctions against @entity9 , mr @entity0 will say			1
he will also use the speech to criticise the ‘ warped ’ human rights organisation @entity160 , which sparked outrage after one of its research directors described @entity109 as a ‘ beautiful young ’ man , and praise the ‘ dedication ’ and ‘ brilliance ’ of intelligence officers			0
he is expected to say : ‘ the responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them			0
‘ but a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them			0
