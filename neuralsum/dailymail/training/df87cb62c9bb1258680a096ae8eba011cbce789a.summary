by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold his name only seems to float into the wider consciousness every four years and , right on cue , @entity2 's @entity1 is making the headlines once again			1
the veteran 35 - year - old has been named as the only out - and - out striker in @entity10 's squad for the @entity11 , giving him the opportunity to make a nice bit of history out in @entity15			1
he needs two more goals to overtake @entity15 legend @entity17 and become the record all - time goalscorer in @entity11 tournaments			1
here we go again : 35 - year - old @entity1 has been selected as @entity2 's only out - and - out striker for the @entity11 finals in @entity15 chosen one : coach @entity10 ( left ) picked his final 23 names for the finals in @entity15 on monday and included @entity1 for his seventh major tournament goalkeepers : @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 96 ) defenders : @entity36 ( @entity30 ) , @entity37 ( @entity32 ) , @entity38 ( @entity32 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 04 ) , @entity41 ( @entity32 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( @entity30 ) midfielders : @entity46 ( @entity40 04 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity49 ( @entity30 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity30 ) , @entity55 ( @entity30 ) , @entity56 ( @entity43 ) , @entity57 ( @entity43 ) , @entity58 ( @entity32 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 ) , @entity61 ( @entity30 ) forward : @entity1 ( @entity63 ) and @entity17 magnanimously said he would be happy for @entity1 if he stole the honour in his own backyard			1
' i am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken , ' @entity17 said			0
' it would be nice to keep it for a while longer but i am cheering for someone to break the record			0
it will be good for the sport			0
' @entity17 's record is 15 goals in 19 appearances at the @entity11 finals			1
@entity1 's stands at 14 in the same number of matches			0
if @entity2 reach the latter stages , @entity1 will be 36 and , despite his incredible longevity , it 's a safe bet to say he wo n't get another chance to claim the record			2
he is also currently tied with @entity88 on 68 as the @entity91 team 's all - time leading scorer and so could claim a double if he finds the net			1
record to beat : @entity1 has a chance to overhaul @entity17 's record of 15 goals in @entity11 tournaments top of the charts : @entity1 also needs one more goal to overtake @entity88 's all - time record of 68 goals for the @entity2 national team 1 @entity17 ( @entity15 ) - 15 goals in 19 games2 @entity88 ( @entity2 ) - 14 in 13 = @entity1 ( @entity2 ) - 14 in 194 @entity104 ( @entity105 ) - 13 in 65 @entity106 ( @entity15 ) - 12 in 146 @entity107 ( @entity108 ) - 11 in 5 = @entity109 ( @entity2 ) 11 in 17 given the wealth of attacking midfield talent at his disposal , @entity10 decided it was n't necessary to take @entity115 's @entity114 alongside @entity1 as he named his chosen 23 on monday			1
@entity1 scored eight goals in 29 appearances for @entity63 last season , half the haul of his previous campaign			0
@entity114 managed 11 goals and nine assists for @entity115 in the @entity123 but the 21 - year - old will undoubtedly get his chance in the future			0
@entity1 's international record is beyond question , however , spanning 13 years , seven major tournaments , three managers and a good few strike partners			0
it was @entity133 who handed him his debut back in march 2001 , rewarded by @entity1 's first goal as @entity137 were beaten 2 - 1 in a @entity11 qualifier			2
many will remember the hat - trick he scored in @entity2 's 8 - 0 demolition of @entity142 under the @entity143 at the 2002 finals , followed up by strikes in the other group matches against the @entity147 and @entity148			2
heads you win : klose nods home one of his five headed goals for @entity2 at the 2002 @entity11 finals , against the @entity147 in @entity154 flying : @entity1 scored five goals in all at the 2002 finals , including a hat - trick against @entity142 head over heels : @entity1 celebrates his @entity11 goal against @entity148 back in 2002 in customary fashion 1 @entity88 68 goals in 62 games = @entity1 68 in 1313 @entity109 47 in 108 = @entity133 47 in 905 @entity57 46 in 1136 @entity162 45 in 957 @entity163 43 in 728 @entity164 42 in 989 @entity165 37 in 7010 @entity166 33 in 61 all the goals were headers and his front - flip celebration became something of a trademark as @entity2 finished runners - up to @entity15 out in the @entity173			1
on his way back from a knee injury , @entity1 was n't fully fit at @entity176 and @entity2 bombed out in the group stages			0
decent form in the friendlies leading up to the 2006 @entity11 gave @entity1 , who at that time played for @entity181 , a chance to make amends for 2002 on home territory			0
he duly scored twice in the opener against @entity186 , two more against @entity187 and a crucial late equaliser against @entity189 in the quarter - finals - enough to carry home the @entity192 - but @entity2 suffered heartbreak in the classic semi-final with @entity195			0
@entity1 's good form after making a Â£ 12m move to @entity30 made him a cert for @entity10 's @entity200 squad and he boosted his tournament goals tally by scoring against @entity202 in the last eight and @entity204 in the last four			2
heading for victory : @entity1 heads the winner as @entity2 beat @entity207 1 - 0 in @entity32 during the 2006 @entity11 finding the target : @entity1 tries his hand at archery as the @entity91 squad relax during the 2006 finals punchline : celebrating his second goal in the 2006 group stage win over @entity187 in the @entity216 monday june 16 , @entity217 ( 5pm gmt ) @entity218 june 21 , @entity219 ( 8pm gmt ) @entity220 june 26 , @entity221 ( 5pm gmt ) @entity222 but for the second time in his career , there would be disappointment in a major final as @entity227 beat them 1 - 0			1
seven goals in qualifying helped @entity2 to the 2010 @entity11 finals in @entity232 and @entity1 again saved his best for the knockout stages , scoring the first in the 4 - 1 win over @entity237 and a double in the 4 - 0 rout of @entity189			1
@entity1 moved from @entity30 to @entity63 midway through the @entity241 qualifying campaign , but it did n't halt his regular goalscoring form as nine goals earned @entity2 their spot in @entity207 and @entity245			2
a goal against @entity247 in the quarter - finals was all @entity1 had to show from the tournament itself as @entity2 again came up short in the semi-finals			0
but with plenty still in the tank , @entity1 again spearheaded @entity2 's attack through another qualification campaign and , entering his seventh finals tournament , earned himself the chance to write himself permanently into the record books as he pens the final chapter of a long and successful career chock full of goals			1
breakthrough : @entity263 looks on in horror as @entity1 slides @entity2 into the lead against @entity237 at the 2010 finals in the net : @entity1 scores one of his two goals in the 4 - 0 quarter - final win over @entity189 in 2010			0

@entity63 player , 35 , selected as @entity2 's only out - and - out striker by @entity10
veteran needs two goals in @entity15 to overtake @entity17 's @entity11 scoring record
legendary @entity15 said he would be *pleased* to see record broken
@entity1 requires one more to become @entity2 's all - time leading scorer
