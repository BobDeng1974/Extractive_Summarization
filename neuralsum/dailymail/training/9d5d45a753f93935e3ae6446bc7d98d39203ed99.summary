by @entity0 published : 16:38 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 12:53 est , 10 october 2013 lap of luxury : @entity0 is 30 - years - old and still living at home my name is called and i make my way to the dining room			1
as i 've requested , there are sweet potatoes to accompany the chicken - breast meat only			2
even better , there 's apple crumble - just this side of tart with a hint of cinnamon , and a choice of custard or creme fraiche			1
no , i 'm not in a country house hotel			0
i 'm at home with my doting parents , and home - made meals like this come as part of my all - inclusive package			1
when i tell people i 'm a 30 - year - old woman who still lives at home , they pity me			1
they tut - tut about rising house prices and i nod in agreement , explaining that my meagre earnings as a freelance makes leaving home any time soon a financial impossibility			1
i am part of a generation who ca n't get well - paid jobs , ca n't afford houses and as a result ca n't even leave home			1
but it 's a little more complicated than that			2
the truth is that living in the comfortable luxury of my family home , a warm , cheerfully decorated , four - bedroom , semi-detached house in @entity50 - a property way beyond my means as a single woman - means that i have no impetus to leave			1
why should i ? where could i live this well , with three meals a day , a laundry service , full use of the garden and all utilities - all completely free ? where is the incentive to strike out on my own ? i know my friends feel the same			1
no wonder a survey by @entity68 revealed that there are nearly three million 20 to 34 - year - olds living with their parents			1
we are known as the boomerangers - the generation who have come back to live off the wealth created by our baby boomer parents , now in their 60s			1
i admit i do get the odd stab of shame when i think that my parents had left home by my age			2
like most people of their generation , it was unthinkable that they would still be living with their parents in their 30s			1
traditionally , you lived at home until you married , at which point you set up home with your spouse			0
when most people married in their early 20s , that made perfect sense			2
in @entity100 , it 's normal to remain in your childhood homes into your adult years , and sometimes even after marriage			1
it 's now happening in @entity104			2
@entity105 : @entity0 returned home because , as a freelancer , it did n't make financial sense for her to live independently while sociologists warn of the creation of a stunted generation unprepared for the responsibilities of adult life , i do n't see it that way			1
why should i leave a home i 'm happy in just to conform to social norms , when my parents are still happy for me to live here ? in fact , my younger sisters , who are in their 20s , still live at home , too			1
furthermore , i know the dire nature of the alternative			0
in a foolish bid for independence , i moved out of home for a year in my mid- 20s , renting a room in a shared house in @entity132 with five other young people			2
the kitchen sink was permanently over-flowing with dirty crockery ( yes , some of it was mine ) and the house was freezing because we could n't afford to heat it			2
after a year , i 'd had quite enough of having to queue for my morning shower as if i was at a campsite			2
from the cheap furniture to the bland decor , living in rented accommodation was absolute misery			2
then there were my housemates			0
while two are still friends , if i never see the others again it will be a blessing			0
when my contract was up , i happily moved back home			0
months later i was still furious with myself for spending Â£ 600 a month to live in a dirty house with people i could n't stand			1
of course , there are times when my parents , sisters and i fall out , but because we love each other , things blow over quickly			1
' in fact , like me , most of my friends are still living with their parents			1
not only does it make financial sense , but we recognise we 'd be stupid to suffer in discomfort and penury just to prove a point			1
' occasionally , other people will make snide comments about my ' poor parents ' and muse on how desperate they must be for me to flee the nest , but this could n't be further from the truth			1
my parents have worked hard to build a comfortable family home and are only too pleased that i still want to live in it			1
when i moved out in my 20s , @entity185 was indignant ; she took it as a personal insult that i wanted to leave her lovely home and castigated me for frittering away my hard - earned money on paying a greedy landlord 's mortgage			1
now i 'm back home , some other people assume my living situation would make me a social pariah among my peers			1
in fact , like me , most of my friends are still living with their parents			2
not only does it make financial sense , but we recognise we 'd be stupid to suffer in discomfort and penury just to prove a point			1
other friends say they would still be at home given the chance			0
even the ones who wear their domestic independence like a badge of honour run home to mummy and daddy at the first sign of a cold or after a break - up			0
the truth is nothing will ever be as comforting as a home - cooked meal followed by a tv marathon on your parents ' sofa , no matter how old you are			2
the fridge is always well - stocked and we never run out of milk or toilet roll - which ca n't be said about the homes of friends who live by themselves			1
but not everyone agrees that my set - up is a lifestyle nirvana			0
i 've been accused of holding myself back and missing out on the freedom of being young and single			0
and while i admit that living at home means you ca n't invite a long line of boyfriends back to stay or host wild parties , i can live with that			1
if i want to sit up drinking all night , i can do it at the home of one of my friends who rents			0
enduring love : @entity0 pictured with her doting family best of all , after a weekend of partying , i can always return to a warm , clean house			2
it really is the best of both worlds			0
meanwhile , i 'm not expected to contribute to the running of the house , financially or otherwise			0
while my dad , who owns a shop , works six days a week to pay the bills , my stay - at - home mum spends her days cleaning , washing and tidying up my mess			0
yes , i may have to sleep in a single bed , but i never have to wash the sheets myself			0
that said , i 'd be lying if i said i was n't conscious that i 'm not pulling my weight			0
for my part , i live by my parents ' rules , work hard and try to make them proud			1
i 'm also an enthusiastic cook and make a family meal at least once a week			0
it 's not much , but it 's heartfelt on my part and appreciated by them			0
it 's not always plain sailing , though			0
on occasion , my parents have rebelled			0
more than once @entity185 has thrown in the tea towel , and the pair of them have demanded that my sisters and i do more to help out			0
in fact , a note outlining our household responsibilities - including putting dirty crockery straight in the dishwasher and keeping our rooms tidy - is stuck on the fridge door as testament to one such row			0
but actually , nothing really changes			0
after years of living together , we 're stuck in our ways , regardless of the rights or wrongs			2
cosseted from the harsh realities of the world ? almost certainly			0
living in a state of suspended adolescence ? all of these things may be true			0
and i 'd ponder them deeply , honestly i would			0
but right now @entity185 is calling me down for dinner .			0

@entity0 is 30 - years - old , but she and her sisters still live with her parents
she 's a freelance *writer* so it does n't make financial sense to live elsewhere
but @entity0 does n't mind - she 's living in the lap of luxury !
and she 's not alone : almost 3 million 20 - 34 - year - olds live with their parents
