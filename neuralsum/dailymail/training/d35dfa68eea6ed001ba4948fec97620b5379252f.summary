currently i am feeling well and would describe my current situation as stable			0
wide attention : the teenager gave a speech at 10 @entity49 last year before his illness worsened ‘ different people will put my recent physical improvement down to different reasons ; i do n’t want to over dramatise things too much , but i do just want to mention that everyone ’s positive thoughts and support has been hugely appreciated , so thank you for that			2
‘ the tumours in my body are still rife and dangerous , but i feel so lucky to just still be here , and in fact i feel completely privileged to be in this position where i can help make such a difference to other people ’s lives			0
‘ the main thing i ’ve always felt passionately about is helping others ... i ’ve always been a firm believer that people are “ good ” , and to see people come together for the cause recently in the way they have is incredibly touching and heartwarming			0
‘ thank you from me , and also thank you from every young cancer patient in the future who will benefit invaluably from the money raised ! ’ he added : ‘ i always describe my cancer as a huge kick up the backside that taught me a lot of good : the importance of helping others , of making every second count , of making sure life is for @entity88 , amongst other things			2
’ @entity1 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was 15			1
after he realised he did not have long to live , he set himself a ‘ bucket list ’ of 46 challenges to tick off in his final days , including a charity skydive , quizzes , a football match and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd			0
@entity1 managed to tick off 33 goals , the first of which was raising £ 10,000 for the @entity31			1

‘ @entity1 is making the biggest possible difference to @entity31 and the young people who need our help			1
’ in a post on thursday @entity1 revealed how he had bounced back after suffering a collapsed lung , adding with characteristic fearlessness : ‘ in all honesty i was probably not too far from nearly leaving you all			2
’ he said : ‘ one doctor while seeing me even said how my medical notes and how i was actually doing did n’t quite seem to match up			0
fundraiser : @entity1 organised a @entity136 for the world 's longest continuous group drum roll ‘ the progress since has continued to be good but steady			1
