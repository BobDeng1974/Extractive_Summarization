at the time , the @entity50 described the case as a postscript to the ' pump - and - dump ' scandals of the previous decade related to several shell companies that cost unsuspecting investors millions of dollars in losses			1

' i drove a white @entity69 in high school , snorted half of @entity72 , and got any guy i ever wanted because my father would take them flying in his @entity76 , ' she said of the heady 90s			0
but for @entity11 , her mother and two sisters it all came crashing down when the truth behind @entity15 's scheme began unraveling			2
stinging rebuke : @entity11 wrote that @entity6 's film glorifies the same bad behavior that nearly brought @entity87 economy to its knees a few years ago landed on his feet : real - life @entity16 @entity15 , pictured right with his wife , served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay $ 110.4million , but reinvented himself ans an author and motivational speaker when her father surrendered to prison in the fall of 2004 after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges , his 18 - year - old daughter drove him			1

@entity118 described it as a confusing experience , going from her father 's private jet to waiting table for meager tips			0
' i couch surfed for two years , sometimes dressing out of my car and stealing pieces of salami out of my boyfriends ' refrigerators in the middle of the night , ‘ she wrote , ‘ because i was so hungry and so ashamed that i could n't feed myself			2
' @entity11 , now in her late 20s , concluded her letter with a lengthy rant against @entity6 and @entity17 - ' @entity133 ’ - calling them ' dangerous ' and rebuking them for making a film that turns financial schemes rooted in greed into entrainment			2
punishment : @entity11 's father , a securities lawyer not portrayed in the movie , went to prison in 2004 for securities fraud in connection to @entity15 's scam sexist : @entity11 also railed again what she called blatant misogyny on display in the film ‘ we want to get lost in what ? these phony financiers ' fun sexcapades and coke binges ? come on , we know the truth , ’ she said			1
‘ this kind of behavior brought @entity87 to its knees			0

in her ire - filled letter addressed to the creators of the film and @entity15 himself , @entity11 drove the point home , saying that a man like @entity15 does not deserve to be a protagonist in a movie			1
as a parting salvo , @entity14 ’s daughter concluded her letter by urging ' every human in @entity87 ' not to support @entity6 's film			2
