by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 23:30 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 11 november 2013 a 2,000lb satellite fell through the @entity5 's atmosphere today at around 7pm est. according to the @entity7 , the @entity6 burned up when going through the @entity5 's atmosphere			1
remaining debris could have fallen anywhere along a path through @entity11 and the @entity12 to @entity13			2
' the most probable impact ground swath largely runs over ocean and polar regions , as well as uninhabited areas of @entity19 , ' the space agency noted on its website earlier today			0
incoming : @entity21 's 2,000 - pound @entity6 , or @entity6 , plummeted down to @entity5 at 7pm - and no one knew for sure where it landed @entity6 was last observed passing 121km ( 75 miles ) above @entity13 at 10:42pm gmt. as the whizzing @entity25 - descended scientists monitored its movements to determine the landing site and ensure public safety			1
not everyone was as sure as scientists were that it would land in the oceans that cover 70 per cent of the @entity5 's surface			1
on saturday , @entity34 gaming company @entity33 gave @entity35 six to four odds it would crash - land in @entity39 or @entity38			0
the 1.2 - ton , $ 466million science satellite built by @entity42 and @entity43 engineers was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity5 's gravity , and now it is doomed by its force			1
scientists assembled the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet 's crust and mantle , among other projects			0
full name : gravity field and steady - state @entity58 launched : 17 march 2009 launcher : rockot ( with @entity64 upper stage ) by @entity65 launch site : @entity67 , @entity68 nominal life : 20 months cost : $ 466million orbit : about 161.5 miles altitude , polar , @entity72 - synchronous mass : 2,000lbs dimensions : 17.4 feet long , about 3.3 foot body diameter propulsion tank : 88.2lbs of xenon gas mission : measuring @entity5 's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution the arrowhead - shaped @entity6 ran out of xenon fuel on october 21 and has been steadily losing altitude since , tugged by @entity5 's gravity			1
the satellite was intended to orbit at 160 miles , but on saturday morning it hovered at just 105 miles			0
with its aerodynamic design featuring wings and tail fins , @entity6 has been called the ‘ @entity91 of space			2
’ @entity93 , senior science and technology editor for @entity94 , told @entity95 that earthlings would only have to be ‘ a little bit worried ’ about the plunging pile of scorched space debris			0
‘ whenever you have one ton of hardware coming down , no one knows where , that 's not a good thing , ’ he said			0
with two - thirds of @entity5 covered by water and vast areas of sparsely populated land , the risk to human life and property was considered extremely low , the @entity7 said			2
rocket science : @entity6 is seen on show at the @entity117 @entity116 space facility before press day , on july 18 , 2007 space mission : @entity6 was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity5 's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution @entity93 explained that it was estimated that about 45 pieces of satellite debris , each weighing no more than 200lbs , would breach the atmosphere and land within a footprint of 190 square miles			1
‘ so a satellite would practically have to be aiming at your house to strike it , ’ @entity93 wrote in his friday @entity94 column			0
@entity135 : @entity93 , senior science and technology editor for @entity94 , said that earthlings should be ' a little bit worried ' about the plunging pile of scorched space debris due to constant changes in @entity5 's upper atmosphere , scientists had trouble determining where and when @entity6 would re-enter			1
satellites that are too bulky to bring down safely to @entity5 after they had served their purpose are sometimes boosted into one of the graveyard orbits more than 22,000 miles up , where they can hang around for centuries			0
for @entity6 , however , it was not a viable option because the satellite only has a small , weak ion engine on board			2
the last big satellite to fall back through the atmosphere was @entity68 's failed @entity160 @entity159 probe			2
the 14 - ton spacecraft re-entered in january 2012			0
in 2011 , @entity163 's 6.5 - ton @entity162 and @entity42 's 2.4 - ton x-ray rosat telescope re-entered			0
@entity166 , head of the @entity7 's space debris office in @entity42 , told the site spaceflight now that statistically speaking , it is 250,000 times more likely to win the jackpot in the @entity42 lottery than to get hit by a @entity6 fragment			1
about 100 tons of space debris falls to @entity5 every year , and so far there have been no reports of injuries of fatalities caused by extra-terrestrial scrap metal			1
in living color : in this handout image supplied by the @entity7 , a rendering of the variations in @entity5 's gravitational pull is shown as seen by the @entity21 's @entity6 satellite however , under @entity189 ’s @entity188 created in september of 1972 , should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry , the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable , @entity35 reported			1
the treaty , which has been ratified by 88 countries as of january 2013 , guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation			0
in the case of @entity6 , the satellite was launched from @entity68 , so that country would be on the hook for any damage .			2

the satellite broke through @entity5 's atmosphere at around 7pm *tonight*
most of the space - craft burnt up , but surviving debris is somewhere on the @entity5 's surface
gravity field and steady - state @entity58 , or @entity6 , was launched in 2009 to map variations in @entity5 's gravity
@entity6 ran out of xenon fuel october 21 and has been losing altitude since
scientists do not know the exact *location* but it was last seen flying over @entity13
