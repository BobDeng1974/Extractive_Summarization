by @entity0 @entity1 has sought clarity over the role of a chief football operations officer at @entity5 – amid concerns his plea for a new chief scout is falling on deaf ears			1
@entity10 revealed last month that @entity12 chief executive @entity11 had met former @entity5 midfielder @entity13 about the possibility of returning to the club in the @entity17 position created in his 120 - day review			1
@entity1 has stated he would have no issue with the move – provided he was guaranteed final say over player recruitment			1
but he remains in the dark as to whether someone like @entity13 would effectively be the club ’s eyes and ears on potential transfers at home and abroad			1
in the dark : @entity12 boss @entity1 has been told nothing of the potential appointment of @entity13 were that not to be the case , @entity1 believes the lack of a chief scout will seriously hinder the club ’s prospects of building for the future			1
‘ i spoke with @entity11 half an hour ago and nothing has been said about @entity13 or any director of football so i do n’t know anything about it , ’ he said			1
‘ i would expect to know something but it ’s gone quiet			2
‘ my priority is to win the league but in terms of the infrastructure , we desperately need a chief scout			1
‘ finance plays a big part in why we ca n’t plan longer term			2
‘ you lose 20 players valued at £ 40million and you replace them with free transfers			2
it is not rocket science and not a criticism of the boys you are bringing in			0
it is a fact of life			0
familiar territory : former @entity64 international @entity13 played for @entity12 between 2001 and 2004 ‘ we have to replace quality and get quality back in to get back to that level we want to be at			1
you are not going to do that in a year			0
‘ we had a team to win the @entity72 and a team last year and we have a team this year			0
we just have to keep strengthening			0
‘ the one thing you do have with a chief scout and a scouting department is you have the potential to do a @entity80 ( with @entity81 )			1
‘ go and get a boy at 18 , 19 and say : “ @entity83 , it looks like we are not going to play you for 18 months , but we are going to develop you			0
” that is the ideal world			0
striking @entity81 : @entity86 cashed in on the sale of teenager @entity81 to @entity80 ‘ we are light years away from that yet			0
we need to get back to having a base where we have people at games , going to @entity92 to watch under - 18 and under - 21 tournaments			0
‘ whether that is the chief football officer ’s gig or the chief scout ’s gig is up for debate			1
but if we want to get back to a top standard in @entity100 and hopefully get back into @entity92 football , we have to have people assessing players			2
’ summer signings @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 have provided ammunition for critics who believe @entity1 ’s line of vision is too narrow			1
experienced : @entity1 has moved to bring in veteran strikers @entity105 ( centre ) and @entity106 ( right ) while content with those acquisitions , he feels the lack of a proper scouting network means recruiting potential hidden gems from untapped markets is currently impossible			1
‘ @entity119 , @entity105 ( @entity120 ) and myself watch @entity123 and @entity124 football , absolutely everything			2
but we ca n’t go and watch players unless they are in @entity100 because of the situation the club is in			2
‘ that is the beauty of having a scouting department			0
at this moment in time you are actually just watching games off videos			0
you are getting players sent to you from agents , which is great and we follow it up , but it is not ideal			0
