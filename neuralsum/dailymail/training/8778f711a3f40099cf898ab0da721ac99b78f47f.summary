by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:55 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:05 est , 26 february 2014 @entity5 @entity4 threatened to resign if the @entity7 government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders @entity5 's first minister dramatically threatened to quit today din protest at the collapse of the @entity14 bomb trial			1
@entity4 said he had been left in the dark about a catalogue of appalling blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers @entity22 walk free from court			1
he condemned the ' despicable ' way the @entity7 government had behaved and demanded an urgent judicial inquiry into how letters were sent to scores of suspects telling them they were not wanted by police			1
@entity22 , 62 , was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the july 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four @entity32 soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people			1
another horse , @entity36 , survived and became a national hero			2
but convicted @entity38 terrorist @entity22 was told yesterday that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘ get - out - of - jail - free card ’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police			1
the letter was sent in july 2007 , when @entity44 was prime minister , assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since may 29 , 1983			1
the case has created a major stand - off between @entity50 and @entity51 , with the @entity53 government refusing to take the matter any further			1
issuing his threat to resign , mr @entity4 said : ‘ i am not prepared to be the first minister of a government that has found itself having salient facts relevant to matters that are devolved hidden from them			1
‘ that is not acceptable to me			0
i want to have a full judicial inquiry into who knew what , when they knew it and exactly what they did know at the time			0
‘ i also want to ensure that the letters that have been sent out are rescinded			0
first minister @entity4 ' the despicable way that the government has treated the institutions in @entity5 shows that they do n't uphold the institutions in @entity5			1
' in the @entity76 , @entity75 condemned the ' dreadful mistake ' of the letter being sent to mr @entity22			1
but signalled that the decision to release @entity22 would not be overturned			1
the prime minister told @entity81 : ' we should be absolutely clear - the man should never have received the letter that he received , @entity22			1
' it was a dreadful mistake and a mistake that we now need to have a rapid factual review to make sure that this can not happen again			1
' but , whatever happens , we have to stick to the principle that we are a country and a government under the rule of law			1
' convicted @entity38 member : @entity22 , 62 , of @entity95 , walked free from court after being given a letter by the @entity44 government telling him he was not wanted by policy			1
prime minister @entity75 condemned the letter as a ' dreadful mistake ' explosion : a detachment of the @entity104 's @entity32 lay dead , victims of a concealed car bomb detonated in @entity51 's @entity14 defence minister @entity107 , a former barrister , said she could understand why mr @entity4 was ' very angry ' but there was no chance of a judicial review			1
she told @entity111 's @entity112 : ' he ca n't get a judicial review , with the best will in the world			2
' you ca n't judicially review the decision			0
you can appeal it , the prosecution can appeal it			0
@entity121 has made it clear the @entity123 has taken the view that these are not the right circumstances to appeal it			0
' so , with great respect to @entity4 , who is quite right to be very angry , absolutely right to be angry , but we are in a very , very unpleasant , bad situation and , unfortunately , i can not see any way back from where we are now			2
' defence minister @entity107 later attorney general @entity121 repeatedly rejected emotional pleas to reopen the case			0
he told mps : ‘ @entity136 was arrested on 19 may 2013 at @entity137 where he was en route to @entity139			2
‘ on his arrest he produced a letter stating that he was free to enter the jurisdiction without fear of arrest			0
despite that letter he was charged by the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) with four counts of murder			0
‘ before he was charged my consent was sought , as the law requires , for him to face a charge of causing an explosion			2
‘ i believed then that it was right to do so and i remain of the same view today			0
’ he insisted the scheme under which the letter was issued did not amount to an amnesty , adding : ‘ can i firstly make the point that it 's clear from the judgment and the supporting material that the administrative scheme was not and never could be an amnesty ? ’ however mps lined up to condemn what is seen as a ‘ monumental ’ blunder			2
two of the four victims : the families of @entity32 soldiers @entity171 ( left ) and @entity172 ( right ) said they ' never ceased in their desire to see that justice be done ' deaths : @entity177 ( left ) and @entity178 ( right ) , the other two soldiers killed in the bombing in 1982 @entity180 , @entity181 chairman of the @entity5 select committee , said called for the name of person who authorised the scheme to be made public and suggested it may have come from mr @entity44 himself			1
he said : ‘ surely that must have been the prime minister of the time ? ’ mr @entity180 also questioned the role of the @entity190 ( @entity190 ) , which gave assurances to mr @entity22 that he was not being pursued by any police force in the @entity7			1
nearly 200 suspected @entity38 terrorists on the run have received similar letters , effectively granting them an amnesty under a deal by mr @entity44 and @entity199 leader @entity198			0
families of the victims of the @entity14 bombing said they felt ‘ devastatingly let down ’ by ‘ catastrophic failures ’ and called for a review of the ‘ comfort letters ’ issued to @entity38 suspects			2
in a statement , the relatives of corporal @entity172 , 36 , lieutenant @entity208 , 23 , trooper @entity177 and lance corporal @entity178 , both 19 , who were slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the @entity211 and @entity212 rode to the @entity214 ceremony , said : ‘ it is with great sadness and bitter disappointment that we have received the full and detailed judgment and that a trial will now not take place			2
‘ this news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down , even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the @entity190			1
‘ the end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to be done			0
’ @entity232 , 52 , the widow of @entity233 , added : ‘ it ’s the cruellest injustice			0
for 32 years we have waited for justice			0
‘ we all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock			0
it ’s absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case			0
this case has made a mockery of the criminal justice system			0
’ lieutenant @entity244 23 - year - old had been married for just 27 days when he died at the scene			0
the blast tragically happened as his mother was waiting in nearby @entity32 for the mounted troop to arrive			0
lt @entity171 had not long returned from a tour in @entity5 where his replacement was shot and killed by a sniper squadron quartermaster corporal @entity253 36 - year - old was the standard bearer of the @entity211 , and died in hospital three days after being injured in the blast trooper @entity257 19 - year - old had also been married for less than a month , and died at the scene lance corporal @entity260 19 - year - old was married with two children , aged three and 22 months			0
he died the day after the blast - a week before his 20th birthday for more than 30 years , @entity22 has had the @entity38 bombing in @entity14 hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice .			2

@entity4 claims he has been left in the dark by @entity7 government
@entity22 , 62 , had been told he was not wanted by police in 2007
this was despite there being an outstanding warrant against him
@entity22 's lawyer *successfully* argued defendant should not go on trial
familes furious over blunder , saying they feel ' devastatingly let down '
@entity75 condemns ' dreadful mistake ' but will abide by the law
shocking attack in 1982 in @entity51 park left four soldiers dead
