@entity0 will take a one - shot lead into the final round of the @entity3 at @entity4 as he goes in search of a first @entity6 win in over four years			1
the @entity7 came into the day one shot behind overnight leader @entity9 but shot a 67 , which was 10 shots better than his playing partner , to move to 15 under			1
@entity14 was the third member of the final group and a 68 was good enough to move him to 14 under , two shots clear of @entity17 and @entity19 @entity18			2
@entity0 , pictured last week , will be hoping to win the last @entity6 event of the calendar year @entity0 claimed his last win in april 2010 in @entity23 and looked well on course to take a larger advantage into the final day at @entity26 as he led by three going up the last			1
but a closing bogey coupled with a birdie for @entity29 saw the gap narrowed to a single shot at the top of the leaderboard			1
@entity0 registered three birdies in his opening five holes but dropped one at the sixth before a further birdie on eight saw him reach the turn in 33			1
the 41 - year - old then picked up shots on 10 and 13 to seemingly put him in total control before the two - shot swing on the last			2
birdies on four , five , 11 and 13 had @entity29 in the hunt but bogeys on 16 and 17 saw him slip back before his closing birdie			0
overnight leader @entity9 , pictured on friday , was overtaken by fellow @entity48 a run of four birdies from the fourth to the seventh and an eagle on the par - five 13th lit up @entity17 's round while @entity18 overcame a double bogey on the 10th with five birdies in his 68			1
@entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 were all on 11 under with veteran @entity62 a further shot back			0
@entity9 slipped nine shots off the lead but was level par for his round through 15 on saturday			1
however a double - bogey , triple - bogey , bogey finish saw his round implode as he fell off the pace			0
@entity0 finished in a tie for second at the @entity75 last week and he feels a better understanding of his game is contributing to his form			1
' four under par was a good score , ' he told a press conference following his round			0
' ( it was ) a little sour to finish with a bogey on the last hole but that 's the way it works			2
' he added : ' i 've always tried to do things with the golf ball that maybe i ca n't actually do and i 'm just really comfortable in a place where i kind of know my own game			0
' i 'm not a bomber but i can keep it in front of me and i can hit some good solid iron shots in there			0
' it 's a little bit just being comfortable and relaxing and having fun			2
' rain made conditions difficult for all players on saturday and @entity0 was pleased with how he handled the conditions			1
' once it started raining it got very difficult , ' he said			0
' the greens got a little bit slower just from the rain so you had to make an adjustment there			0
' if you were in the rough you could catch some squirters where the ball could fly			0
' it was just tough			0
