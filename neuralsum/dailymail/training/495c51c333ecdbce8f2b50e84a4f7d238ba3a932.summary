tragedy : @entity1 passed away in early december after contracting the flu now that the @entity7 has declared a national flu epidemic that has already claimed the lives of at least 15 children and nearly 1,000 others , the parents of a @entity5 teen who died from the virus last month are speaking out			1
@entity1 , 17 , died on december 9 after being struck down with this years mutated @entity13 strain , despite having no underlying health conditions			1
the healthy teenager had not visited a doctor for three years and passed away in her mother 's arms after she had to help daughter out of a bath , so weak was she from the debilitating virus			1
' i helped her get in the bathtub , but when i saw her eyes , i said , ' i think this is a mistake -- we 've got to get you out of here , ' said her mother , @entity29 , in @entity30 , @entity5 , to @entity31 on wednesday			1
' she could n't help me get her out			0
so i lifted her up , and she passed away in my arms			2
' frantically calling for her husband @entity33 to come and help her , @entity1 tried to administer mouth - to - mouth before @entity36 's arrived and flew her by air ambulance to hospital			1
sadly she never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead			0
' she was such an incredible kid , ' said @entity40			0
' she had her whole life planned out			0
she was living life to the fullest			0
if you 're going to have the perfect kid , she was it			0
' scroll down for @entity46 no health issues : according to @entity1 's parents , she had no underlying health problems before she got the flu family : @entity33 , @entity29 and @entity1 at home in @entity5 with their family dog in happier times one week earlier , @entity1 had taken her daughter to a clinic when she became sickly and was told that yes , it was the flu , but that she needed fluids and bed rest			1
however , she became so ill that her liver ' gave out ' according to the autopsy - which confirmed she had type a flu			2
@entity29 has said that although her daughter 's health care was excellent , she wants people suffering symptoms to have tests to see if they have underlying health issue			1
@entity29 also revealed that @entity29 had not had the flu vaccine , however it is unknown if that would have had any bearing because the @entity7 have admitted that this year 's batch is useless against up to 50 percent of flu virus 's this season			1
up to its most recent report issued for the last week of december , the @entity7 said that the flu has hit epidemic levels across the country as activity of the virus became widespread in 36 states			1
officials said that 837 flu deaths were registered in its 122 @entity87 and that those deaths accounted for the 6.8 percent of the 12,358 people who died that week - meeting an epidemic threshold			1
the flu epidemic was raging across the country with 36 states seeing high levels of the outbreak victims : @entity99 , 3 , and @entity100 , 6 , all passed away within 72 hours of contracting the flu the crisis is only going to worsen , with january and february the worst months for flu nationwide			1
the problem worrying the authorities is the particular strain of flu			2
this year 's dominant strain is the @entity13 , which was not targeted by vaccinations this year			2
it affects children and those over 65 particularly , such as @entity99 , who died three days after developing symptoms at home in @entity115 , @entity116			2
@entity99 had no underlying health conditions and was buried on @entity118			1
another child who died just days after developing symptoms was @entity100 , 6 , who passed away in his father 's arms on december 20			1
he had fallen ill just two days before , but was suffering from asthma			2
the @entity7 declared a national flu epidemic on tuesday as this year 's , virulent mutated strain , the @entity127 virus , swept from coast to coast			1
the @entity129 and southeast of the country were being hardest hit with cases			0
the @entity7 said the flu vaccine currently on the market does n't prevent that strain 's spread			1
between october 1 and december 20 , @entity7 figures show that 15 children have died from the virus and four in the week before @entity140			1
epidemic : the number of states reporting high instances of flu across the country now stands at 22 six children in @entity148 have died this year from the flu , according to the state 's @entity150 and so far @entity152 has seen 442 children with flu this month			1
on monday , @entity155 in @entity156 announced that an increased number of patients were coming to the hospital and visitors would be limited			0
other @entity156 hospitals including @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 in @entity165 and @entity166 , also put precautions in place , according to @entity169			2
@entity170 has seen nearly ten times the number of flu cases this year compared to the same time period last year			2
the @entity173 of @entity174 says there were 632 reported flu cases through december 20			2
for the same time period last year , there were just 70 flu cases			2
health officials say the uptick reflects earlier influenza activity being reported throughout the country			0
those particularly at risk are those over 65 and younger than four			0
across the nation , 2,500 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis			0
according to the @entity7 , data from 122 @entity189 cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline and is at the epidemic threshold of 6.8 per cent			1
about 90 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent @entity13 sub-type , the @entity7 reported			1
another state hit hard has been @entity5 , where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year 's flu strain is particularly strong			1
the flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the @entity5 @entity150 have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in december while battling the illness			1
the @entity7 admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain , @entity13			2
that strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations , especially in the elderly			0
' though we can not predict what will happen the rest of this flu season , it 's possible we may have a season that 's more severe than most , ' said @entity7 director , dr @entity222			1
@entity7 officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated			1
flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year			2
last winter , flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall , which experts consider relatively good			0
among infectious diseases , flu is considered one of the nation 's leading killers			0
on average , about 24,000 @entity189 die each flu season , according to the @entity7			1
nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter 's flu season			0
current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus , depending on the product			0
the ingredients are selected very early in the year , based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter			0
the ingredients always include a @entity127 flu virus			0
the most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug			0
the three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003 - 2004 , 2007 - 2008 , and 2012 - 2013 — were @entity13 seasons			1
in march , after the @entity13 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway , health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of @entity13			0
' this is not something that 's been around before , ' @entity222 said			0
but health officials were n't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the @entity189 this winter until recently , they said			0
lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of @entity13			0
specifically , about 48 percent of the @entity13 samples seen so far were well matched to what 's in the vaccine , but 52 percent were not , the @entity7 said			2
an official with one vaccine manufacturer — @entity277 — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine			0
he also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain			0
' we 're at the very beginning of flu season , and it 's quite possible different strains will predominate , ' said dr. @entity291 , director of scientific affairs for @entity277 's vaccines business .			0
