@entity0 praised @entity2 's array of attacking talent but suggested that @entity4 was only concentrating on short - term results			1
the former @entity7 and @entity8 striker , who spent three years at @entity2 , claimed the club should invest in more youthful attacking options			2
' it 's an exceptional attacking unit			0
the only negative thing you would say is that all of the strikers are of a certain age , ' @entity0 told @entity17			1
' club captain @entity30 is 29 years old , new signing @entity31 is 28 while @entity22 is now 31			1
@entity0 was insistent , though , that @entity34 's side will be well catered for in the immediate future			2
he said : ' @entity36 is very exciting and the here and now for the next few years is very exciting			0
' ( @entity22 ) @entity38 is getting a little bit older so he has two or three years at the top still			0
you would say in the next two or three years @entity4 would be wanting to win something			0
' club captain @entity30 is now 29 years old , making him the club 's second youngest first - team striker @entity31 joined the club this summer but is already 28 and with a history of injury problems @entity18 not out of the question - @entity19			1
