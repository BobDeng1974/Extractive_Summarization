liabilities : the wreckage of @entity8 after it crashed at the @entity23 in @entity5			2
more than 70 passengers have reached a settlement in their lawsuits against the airline disaster : an aerial view of the destroyed aircraft , which was consumed by fire after crash landing the court filing published yesterday did not include the settlement 's financial terms , details which plaintiffs ' attorney @entity37 said are confidential			1
' this is the first positive step for these passengers to be able to get closure on a tragic , catastrophic crash and hopefully try to get their lives back together , ' mr @entity37 said			1
' we 're pleased we 've been able to get this first phase resolved			2
' dozens more cases involving other passengers are still pending in federal court in @entity49			1
@entity15 spokesman @entity50 said the aerospace firm does not comment on pending litigation			1
calls to attorneys for @entity56 and @entity17 were not immediately returned , the @entity53 reported			2
on july 6 2013 three @entity58 teenagers were killed and nearly 200 others hurt when the @entity15 from @entity60 slammed into a seawall at the end of a runway during final approach to to @entity23			0
the impact ripped off the back of the plane , tossed out three flight attendants and their seats , and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop			0
victims : @entity75 , left , and @entity76 , right , pose for photos with other classmates in the classroom in @entity80 in eastern @entity58 's @entity82 province			0
both died in the @entity56 jet crash in 2013 grief : an unidentified relative of one of the crash victims cries at the @entity56 ' counter as she and other family members check in for a flight to @entity5 at @entity92 in @entity93 @entity95 safety investigators blamed the pilots , saying they bungled the landing approach by inadvertently deactivating the plane 's key control for airspeed , among other errors			0
but the @entity102 also said the complexity of the @entity15 's auto - throttle and auto flight director — two of the plane 's key systems for controlling flight — contributed to the accident			0
the @entity102 also faulted materials provided to airlines by @entity113 - based @entity15 , saying they fail to make clear the conditions in which the auto - throttle does n't automatically maintain speed			0
investigators said captain @entity118 , a seasoned @entity119 pilot transitioning to the bigger @entity15 , cut the autopilot on final approach into @entity5 , where the instrument landing system was out of service			0
doing so put the auto - throttle on hold , meaning it would no longer automatically control airspeed , explained investigator - in - chief @entity128			0
when the jet dipped below the correct glide path , captain @entity118 reacted by pulling the nose up - but the auto - throttle , still on hold , failed to deliver an expected burst of engine power that would have enabled the airliner to make the runway			0
mr @entity37 said the passengers who settled had injuries that were less serious and have stabilized			1
at least 14 of the people with whom settlements were reached are minors , requiring the court to approve the agreements , according to tuesday 's filing .			1
