by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:05 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 16:25 est , 9 may 2013 seven decades ago , tens of thousands of men stood at @entity3 fearful they might never again see the shores of @entity5			1
a remote inlet in the northwest @entity8 of @entity9 , it was the starting point for the @entity11 on their treacherous journeys to the @entity13 during the @entity14			1
described by @entity16 as the ' worst journey in the world ' , the heroes were risking their lives running a gauntlet of @entity22 warplanes and u-boats to keep the @entity24 fighting on the @entity25			1
yesterday , 39 of the dwindling band of veterans returned to the loch 's shores to receive medals rewarding their bravery from the government			1
poignant : @entity34 convoy veterans gathered at @entity3 for a memorial service where they laid wreaths the proud former sailors were handed the @entity38 after some 70 years of frustration			1
the presentation was a victory for a campaign by the @entity43 to get official recognition for the seaman who served their country in horrendous conditions			1
they gathered at sun - drenched @entity3 for a service to remember their fallen colleagues , 3,000 of whom perished in the freezing waters between 1941 and 1945			1
thousands more have died before they could be officially honoured for their part in the convoys			1
today , only a few hundred veterans are alive			1
only last sunday @entity60 , a veteran who fought for decades to for an @entity34 medal , died aged 85			1
he received his at a ceremony at @entity63 in march but passed away days before he could wear it in public for the first time in a moving ceremony at @entity68 , a personal message of thanks from the @entity71 was read out to the seaman who were just teenagers when they embarked on their missions			1
poppy wreaths were laid at a memorial as @entity78 jets performed a flypast in long - awaited acknowledgment of their courage			1
proud : @entity82 , 89 , served on four @entity11 in 1944 the @entity11 were described by @entity16 as the ' worst journey in the world ' @entity85 , 87 , who sailed on two convoy missions on the destroyers @entity88 and @entity89 , said : ' we got the medal for the ones who are n't here			1
' now we have got the medals i 'm very pleased			1
not just for me but for all my mates as well			1
it brings back good memories			1
' we all went through hell			1
it was freezing cold , sleeping where you could when you have your duties to concentrate on , never knowing when it was our turn for a torpedo			1
' but surrounded by your mates on a ship , we all just carried on			1
' i got a little bit disillusioned while i was waiting for the medal , but today made up for it all			2
' @entity111 , 87 , a member of the @entity112 , served on board the aircraft carriers @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 and made various trips in support of a number of @entity34 convoys			2
he said : ' somebody one day said to me , " you are so brave going to @entity124 "			2
i told them thank you , but there was more too it than that , we had to get back again			2
' the enemies we had were not only @entity22			2
there was the sea , the weather			2
' @entity134 , 88 , was returning to @entity3 for the first time since the end of the @entity14			2
he joined the corvettee @entity138 and completed six convoys - experiencing the horror of seeing allied vessels torpedoed			2
he said : ' it is the end of the past and the beginning of the future today			2
it is recognition of something at last			2
' these are my friends , and there is a lot more that have been gone			0
i have come here for the little celebration of ourselves			0
' @entity155 , 90 , from @entity156 , @entity157 , was a merchant seaman on @entity158 on one of the first convoys in 1941			0
he wrote of his journey in a book entitled @entity163 in @entity164 as his ship was icebound in the @entity124 port for six months			1
it was there he bought a mandolin which he took to yesterday 's ceremony			0
he said : ' it is very strange being back here			0
it 's hard to describe the memories that come back			0
' but i am just amazed we are regarded so highly and people want to remember what we did			0
we just went out there and did what we had to do			0
tragic : @entity60 died just days before he was due to wear his medal in public for the first time ' when we got to the ice sea it was frozen over			0
so the icebreakers dragged us towards @entity164 but we were frozen in			0
' we were in a very grim place , but one of the sailors found a shop which sold musical instruments			0
so we made a band			0
i learnt to play the @entity124 mandolin while i was there and we played some songs			0
' i just found the instrument in my loft , it has been stored in there for about 70 years			0
' thousands of vessels massed in @entity3 before embarking on the treacherous 1,600 - mile journey past the enemy - held shores of @entity202 , through the @entity203 to the frozen wastes of @entity205 and @entity164			1
the convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks , planes , fuel and food to help the @entity124 slow @entity22 's advances on the eastern front			0
more than 66,000 @entity215 sailors and merchant seamen took part			0
in total , 87 merchant ships and 18 @entity5 warships were sunk			0
but the @entity221 meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the @entity13			0
when the war ended those on the convoys were awarded the @entity227 - even though that was a separate campaign 800 miles away			0
but last year prime minister @entity228 ordered the @entity38 medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded			0
he admitted he was ' righting a wrong '			0
campaigners used yesterday 's occasion to launch a Â£ 2.5million fundraising drive to build a museum and new community centre on the site of @entity238 , the @entity11 base from 1941 - 1945 .			0
