by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 13 february 2013 @entity2 leader @entity1 may be handed a giant tax bill after a @entity5 businessman paid around £ 25,000 so he could have an operation in an exclusive private @entity5 hospital			1
the controversial politician allowed prominent @entity10 - @entity5 businessman @entity9 to pick up the tab for a prostate procedure in @entity13 last november			1
mr @entity1 says the procedure had not ' cost the taxpayer a penny ' and was paid for by a man he described as a ' very very good friend '			1
the member of the @entity10 parliament for @entity22 / @entity21 , which is on the border with @entity24 , said the operation had freed him from five years of ' constant pain '			2
tax liability : @entity2 president @entity1 had a £ 25,000 operation in @entity5 paid for by a friend but may be left with a large tax bill as a result @entity9 , who was former chief of life insurance giant @entity32 , is a close friend and agreed to cover the cost as mr @entity1 had ' financial problems ' linked to a second property			1
pals : the help from businessman @entity9 ( pictured ) aided mr @entity1 after five years of constant pain , he said today questions have been raised about whether he will be able to use an @entity10 gift tax exemption , which allows people to write off certain medical costs if it is given as a present			1
but crucially the gift has to be from someone based in @entity24 and as mr @entity9 is often based in @entity5 , the exemption may not apply			1
' mr @entity1 is consulting with his tax advisers as to whether any taxation arises from this medical procedure ' , a @entity2 spokesman said , adding : ' if he owes tax then of course he will pay it '			1
' he did not get this just because he was a member of parliament , it was a close personal friend who paid for it			0
' it could not be done in @entity24 at that time '			0
the @entity2 president said last week there was a ' fixation ' within the media ' on the state of [ his ] health '			2
he told @entity66 's @entity65 show : ' i have had a longstanding and very very painful complaint			0
and as you know i go back and forth to the @entity70 once or twice a year			0
one of my friends introduced me to … his doctor			0
and he recommended that i should have a process of a particular kind			0
' i have been in constant pain for the last five years and at that time , the treatment of this kind was not available in the @entity77			0
' @entity65 explained that such an operation cost in the region of $ 30,000 and it was difficult to explain how mr @entity1 might have that money			0
he said : ' well , i did n't pay for it … a very very good friend of mine , a man called @entity9 , very kindly paid for it … i could n't have afforded it			1
my wife and my family are eternally grateful to him			0
' mr @entity1 also insisted that having private medical treatment was in line with his party 's policies , which is anti-private healthcare			2
he said : ' @entity2 's position , and it remains my position , is for a universal healthcare , a public health service of the very highest standard available to all citizens			2

@entity10 politician received financial help from his friend @entity9 last november
some gifts of medical care can be written off under @entity10 tax laws
but as mr @entity9 is often based in @entity109 may have to find large sum
' if he owes tax then of course he will pay it , ' @entity2 tells @entity114
