the date on which @entity3 's @entity2 lander will attempt to land on comet @entity4 has been revealed as 12 november			1
if all goes to plan , @entity3 will release the @entity2 lander at 0935 bst that day at a distance of 14 miles ( 22.5km ) from the centre of the comet			1
the landing will occur about seven hours later , although confirmation will not arrive back on @entity12 until 1700 bst			1
an inset showing a close up of the landing site is also shown a backup called @entity26 is available if the primary site @entity17 is not used			1
this would see a separation occur later at @entity30 at just 7.8 miles ( 12.5 km ) from the centre of the comet			0
this landing would take just four hours , with confirmation reaching @entity12 at 1830 bst			1
the @entity3 probe will launch its @entity2 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity38			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 12 november			1
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			2
@entity2 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			1
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			2
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity3			2
@entity74 will make a final confirmation on the landing site to be used on 14 october after a formal @entity77			1
the agency has been quick to select a landing site and prepare for the touch down since @entity81 arrived in orbit around the comet on 6 august 2014			1
this is because they want to attempt the landing before the comet gets closer to the sun and becomes more active			0
when this happens it is thought it will release more water vapour , which may be hazardous to the lander ’s health			0
the landing itself even without this hazardous water vapour will be incredibly tense , as such an endeavour has never been successfully completed before			0
the closest comparison is the attempting landing on an asteroid of a probe called @entity103 attached to @entity105 ’s @entity103 spacecraft on 12 november 2005			1
however , in that instance the lander was released at too great a height - and it floated off into space instead of drifting towards the asteroid			0
mission operators for the @entity3 mission will be hoping such a fate does not befall the @entity2 lander			1
nonetheless , @entity3 will still be continuing to study the comet into the future regardless of the outcome of the landing attempt			1
it will use its 11 scientific instruments to study the comet as it orbits the sun. close - up of @entity2 ’s primary landing site @entity17 , which is located on the ‘ head ’ of @entity125 – @entity126			1
@entity17 offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites , and is also scientifically interesting , with signs of activity nearby at @entity135 , the majority of slopes are less than 30º relative to the local vertical , reducing the chances of @entity2 toppling over during touchdown			1
@entity135 also appears to have relatively few boulders , and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge @entity2 and continue science operations when its battery runs out the high - risk manoeuvre , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			1
scientists at mission control in @entity151 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity12 's water and perhaps even life			1
but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity81 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			0
@entity162 is currently travelling through space some 273 million miles ( 440 million km ) from @entity12			0
the relatively smooth landing region , identified for the moment simply by the letter ' j ' , is located on the smaller of the duck - shaped comet 's two lobes			1
a further back up site has been chosen on the larger of @entity38 's lobes , and is currently being marked by @entity74 with the letter ' c '			0
' as we have seen from recent close - up images , the comet is a beautiful but dramatic world - it is scientifically exciting , but its shape makes it operationally challenging , ' @entity174 , @entity175 , said earlier this month			0
' none of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 per cent level , but @entity135 is clearly the best solution			2
' at @entity17 , the majority of slopes have an angle less than 30º , reducing the chances of @entity2 toppling over during touchdown			0
@entity135 also appears to have relatively few boulders , and receives sufficient daily sunlight to recharge @entity2 and continue science operations on the surface beyond the initial battery - powered phase			1
@entity26 was chosen as a backup because of more sunlight hours and fewer boulders			2
but even the flat surface chosen contains potentially dangerous boulders and cracks			0
this reconstructed - colour image , taken earlier this month , indicates how dark the comet appears			0
on average the comet 's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light , making it as dark as coal this 3d image of @entity2 ’s primary landing site on the ‘ head ’ of @entity125 – @entity126 can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with red – green / blue filters @entity26 was chosen as the backup site for @entity3 ’s lander @entity2 during the @entity220 meeting held on 13 to 14 september 2014			1
this image was taken by @entity3 at a distance of about 43 miles ( 70km ) if all goes to plan , @entity2 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			1
according to @entity74 , this is a ' one - shot opportunity ' and real - time radio control will be impossible due to the incredible distance of the comet from @entity12			2
the entire landing process is expected to take seven hours , and if successful , will represent a historic moment in space exploration			0
' we will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site , giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition , structure and evolution of a comet , ' says @entity246 , a lead lander scientist			0
' @entity17 in particular offers us the chance to analyse pristine material , characterise the properties of the nucleus , and study the processes that drive its activity			0
' several different surface regions are shown in this map , which is oriented with the comet 's ' body ' in the foreground and the ' head ' in the background			2
the map was used to help researchers pick a suitable place to drop a lander in november the original five candidate landing sites for @entity81 ’s lander @entity2 , and with the backup , @entity26 , indicated the race to find the landing site could only begin once @entity81 arrived at the comet on 6 august , when the comet was seen close - up for the first time			1
since then , the spacecraft has moved to within 18 miles ( 30km ) of the comet , allowing more detailed scientific measurements of the candidate sites			2
' there 's no time to lose , but now that we 're closer to the comet , continued science and mapping operations will help us improve the analysis of the primary and backup landing sites , ' says @entity3 flight director @entity285			1
' of course , we can not predict the activity of the comet between now and landing , and on landing day itself			0
' a sudden increase in activity could affect the position of @entity3 in its orbit at the moment of deployment and in turn the exact location where @entity2 will land , and that 's what makes this a risky operation			2
' during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			2
zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity3 is at the moment the @entity3 probe will launch its @entity2 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity38			1
if all goes to plan , @entity2 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace @entity81 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week			2
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity162 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			1
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity3			2
' no one has ever attempted to land on a comet before , so it is a real challenge , ' says @entity345 , @entity346 mission manager			0
' the complicated ' double ' structure of the comet has had a considerable impact on the overall risks related to landing , but they are risks worth taking to have the chance of making the first ever soft landing on a comet			0
' comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed			0
by studying the gas , dust and structure of the nucleus and organic materials associated with the comet , via both remote and in situ observations , the @entity3 mission should become the key to unlocking the history and evolution of our solar system			0

instead of imaging a bright , ice - covered comet , the probe ’s instruments have detected that @entity38 is in fact darker than charcoal			0

@entity3 's @entity2 lander will attempt to touch down on the surface of comet @entity4 on 12 november
it will be exactly nine years to the day that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by @entity105 's @entity103 spacecraft failed in 2005
the region , named @entity135 , is around *2.4* miles ( *4km* ) at its widest point
if all goes to plan confirmation of the landing will be returned at 1700 bst
a *secondary* landing area known as @entity26 is also available , with a *decision* on which to be used to be made on 14 october
the sites were chosen as they are relatively flat and gain more sunlight
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the comet 's surface in four to seven hours depending on which landing site is used
it will then use harpoons to keep itself attached to the surface
spider - like probe could answer questions on the origin of life on @entity12
