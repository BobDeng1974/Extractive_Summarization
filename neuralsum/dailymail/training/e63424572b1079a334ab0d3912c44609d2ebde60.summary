by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 16 december 2012 updated : 11:20 est , 16 december 2012 luxury perfume brands fear the @entity3 's new laws against allergens could severely curb or ban natural ingredients used in vintage best - sellers and put some perfume makers out of business			1
but @entity10 ' proposed legislation — a draft will be unveiled early next year — is also causing a stir for another reason			2
it sheds light on the best - kept secret in the £ 20billion trade : many big brands have been tweaking their formulas for years			1
' it is a taboo in the industry			0
people are scared to say anything about it , ' said @entity25 , head of luxury goods at market research company @entity27			2
brands like @entity29 , left , and @entity30 , right , will be most affected by the new regulations as their fragrances use many natural ingredients and were created before scientists started looking into potential health hazards the brands most affected will be those which have been in the perfume industry for more than half a century , such as @entity29 , @entity38 and @entity30			1
all those fragrances use many natural ingredients and were created before scientists started looking into perfumes ' potential health hazards			0
@entity38 's @entity44 , one of the world 's best - selling perfumes and named after its creator 's fifth trial , was created in 1921			1
@entity38 declined to comment on whether it has ever changed the formula of its world - famous perfume , as did @entity30 , @entity29 and luxury brand @entity53 , which all make high - end perfumes using natural ingredients			1
most luxury perfume names do not want to disclose the fact that they have had to make tweaks to their scents for fear they could lose customers or damage their carefully nurtured luxury brand			2
perfume lovers , though , are hard to fool			2
' consumers know their perfume better than any expert , ' said @entity71 , who heads the perfume school in @entity73 set up in 1946 by @entity75 fragrance maker @entity74			1
@entity38 's @entity44 , one of the world 's best - selling perfumes and named after its creator 's fifth trial , was created in 1921 ' we say nothing to consumers , but they notice when their fragrance has been changed and they may decide to opt for another product			1
brands need to be careful when they reformulate their perfumes as they can lose consumers			2
' until now , changes to perfume formulas have come as a result of increasingly severe restrictions imposed by the industry 's self - regulatory body , the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			1
' most perfumes which are 20 years old or more will have already been reformulated several times because science has evolved and we want to ensure the safety of consumers , ' said @entity94 president @entity101			2
if new , even stricter rules are adopted , hundreds of perfumes would have to be reformulated with synthetic allergen - free contents			0
that , many in the industry fear , could threaten their business			0
' if this law goes ahead i am finished , as my perfumes are all filled with these ingredients , ' said @entity113 , who owns high - end perfume company editions de @entity115			1
the impact on luxury perfume brands as a whole would , he said , be ' like an atomic explosion and we would not have the means to rebuild ourselves			1
' most fine perfumes are composed of a mix of natural ingredients and synthetic molecules			0
changing a scent can cost several hundred thousand euros depending on the complexity of the original formula , and perfume makers say that replacing natural with synthetic ingredients is rarely an improvement			2
many traditional essences that perfume creators consider core to their craft have been blacklisted in recent decades			2
birch tar oil was removed from @entity30 's @entity139 several decades ago because it was thought to be a cancer risk			1
@entity147 oil and rose oil , which contain a component called eugenol , and lavender , which contains linalool , may only be used in limited quantities in case of allergies			0
and oakmoss , one of the most commonly used raw materials because of its rich , earthy aroma and ability to ' fix ' a perfume to make it last longer , has been increasingly restricted because of worries about skin sensitivity			2
changing a scent can cost several hundred thousand euros depending on the complexity of the original formula that means perfumes like @entity139 , @entity38 's no. 5 , @entity29 's @entity163 and @entity164 , @entity166 's @entity165 and @entity168 's @entity167 are only a shadow of their original , olfactory selves , according to industry experts			1
' @entity163 was a real [ masterpiece ] in its original form , ' retired perfume - maker @entity174 , who created @entity29 's @entity176 and @entity166 's @entity177 , said of the 1966 scent			1
' it used to be very green and fresh			0
today , it has been replaced by something softer and duller			0
' he contends the scent has been stripped of furocoumarins , a kind of organic chemical compound produced by plants like bergamot that can cause dark spots on the skin when exposed to the sun. mr @entity174 said he still wore @entity163 because it reminded him of his father , @entity192 , who as deputy head of @entity29 perfumes in the 1960s and 1970s supervised the creation of the perfume			1
' @entity163 was a real [ masterpiece ] in its original form , ' retired perfume - maker @entity174 said if the industry largely got away with quietly tweaking its fragrances up till now , however , experts say that will be impossible if @entity203 backs the proposals aimed at wiping allergenic substances from the perfume - makers ' palettes altogether			1
@entity208 , a 68 - year - old @entity73 interior decorator , gave up @entity139 in the 1980s after developing an allergy to it			1
' my neck became all red but i continued wearing @entity139 for a long time			0
it was part of my identity , i could n't just give it up , ' she said			0
' it reminded me of those carefree days of @entity73 in the 1960s			1
' @entity208 is one of an estimated five million to 15 million people , or one to three per cent of the @entity3 population who are allergic or potentially allergic to natural ingredients contained in fine perfumes , according to a report published in july by the @entity224 on @entity225 ( @entity226 )			0
@entity227 , president of the @entity229 ( @entity230 ) , is furious about the recommendation			0
' i simply find that there is a huge contradiction , ' @entity232 said			0
' we encourage the use of many essential oils such as lavender in aromatherapy for massages , but we want to ban it in perfumes			0
shops continue to sell alcohol and cigarettes which do much more harm			0
' part of the problem is the secrecy surrounding perfumes			0
most perfume brands are reluctant to label their products			1
in 2005 , the @entity3 passed a law in 2005 forcing perfume brands to label any of 26 potentially allergenic ingredients			1
the brands now list those ingredients — but in @entity258			2
now the @entity226 is proposing to extend that list to more than 100 potential allergens			0
@entity203 is not the only region to look more closely at the impact of fragrance			0
earlier this year @entity265 lawmaker @entity264 from @entity266 to ban state employees who have contact with members of the public from wearing strong fragrances			0
the bill did not pass , but there are some hospitals in the @entity275 where they have introduced bans on using perfumes .			0

legacy brands like @entity29 , @entity38 and @entity30 will be most affected
many perfume brands have been tweaking their formulas for years
@entity285 will be ' like an atomic explosion ' according to @entity73 company owner
