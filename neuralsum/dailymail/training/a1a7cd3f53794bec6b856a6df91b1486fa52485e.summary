it is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern @entity2 , but @entity4 in fact has an older and more northern brother			0
archaeologists have been carrying out research into a huge late fist century ad defence system , which stretches 120 miles across @entity9			1
a total of 14 forts and several fortlets , which formed part of a defensive network built in the ad 70s , have so far been investigated over the past decade by the team , led by dr @entity18 and dr @entity19 , both of the @entity21			1
archaeologists have been carrying out research into a huge defence system , which is believed to have been built in the ad 70s and stretches 120 miles across @entity9 the structure is not believed to be a continuous wall or ditch , but instead consist of 20 forts , a dozen fortlets and up to 30 watchtowers in total , the @entity25 has reported			1
the network , which is thought to have run from @entity34 or @entity35 , south of @entity36 , on the @entity38 coast to the @entity39 or @entity40 , was built some 50 years before @entity4 , and is an extra 20 years older than @entity41			2
the team , who have carried out surveys of seven of the largest forts over the last five years , are hunting for the missing fortlets and towers			2
the forts are believed to have been manned by more troops than previously thought and it is also believed many were cavalry units			1
the @entity25 has reported the defensive line was built by the @entity55 in an attempt to keep hold of the land they had invaded in around 69 or 70 ad from hostile northern @entity62 tribes			1
it also thought however that the fortress protected the friendly lowland tribes from cattle - raiders , fostering good relations which led to large civilian settlements being set up near the forts			1
according to the @entity25 , these settlements could have been made up of merchants , craftsmen and possibly girlfriends of the troops			0
@entity4 ( pictured ) is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern @entity2 , but archaeologists have been carrying out research into its older brother @entity4 remained in use until the early fifth century although the @entity55 in @entity9 had good relations with many of the locals , they did have tensions with the northern @entity62 tribes , which is thought to have eventually erupted into major conflict in ad 83 or 84			1
it is thought the two sides clashed at the battle of ' @entity90 ' , with up to 30,000 men fighting on either side			0
the precise location of the battle is still unknown , however it is possible the research along the @entity9 fortress , abandoned by the @entity55 in about ad 87 , could lead to its discovery			1
@entity4 , which stretches across northern @entity99 , was built in 122 ad on the orders of the roman emperor @entity101 to mark his empire 's northern frontier			1
it took eight years to build the 73 mile - long wall from the @entity39 to @entity106 on the @entity107			0
it is believed to have provided a barrier between @entity110 and @entity9 and is thought to have been where the army could determine who was allowed access to the empire			1
it remained in use until the early fifth century when , with the empire collapsing and the city of @entity120 itself under threat , the @entity55 left @entity124 shores			2
it is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern @entity2 and is a @entity127			0
when emperor @entity101 built @entity4 nearly 2,000 years ago , it extended 73 miles coast to coast across northern @entity99 from the @entity39 to @entity106 on the @entity107			2
standing 16ft high and up to 12ft wide , it was an extraordinary feat of engineering which was completed in eight years			0
it was built in ad 122 after @entity101 ordered his soldiers to build a barrier between @entity110 and @entity9			1
according to the @entity134 , a chief function of the wall was probably frontier control , where the army enforced the regulations which determined access to the empire			0
it is believed people could only enter the empire at certain points and would have been forced to travel unarmed and under military escort to markets or other specified places			0
it is also believed to have helped to prevent raiding			0
it was believed to have been the first of two fortifications built across @entity154			2
the @entity41 , however , is the lesser known of the two because its physical remains are less evident			0
as well as being a strong military fortification , it is believed the wall featured a number of gates which would have served as customs posts			0
it is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern @entity2 and is a @entity127 .			0

archaeologists reveal @entity55 defence system in @entity9
structure is believed to be made up of forts , fortlets and watchtowers
thought to have been built in ad 70s after @entity55 invaded @entity9
deterred hostile northern @entity62 tribes from invading land
