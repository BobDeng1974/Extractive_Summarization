by @entity0 last updated at 2:18 pm on 12th january 2012 @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity4 games sold 19 million units and became one of the biggest hits on @entity8 - but their supposed health benefits have always been disputed			1
now a study of elderly volunteers has found that @entity4 seems to speed up brain function - when compared to a control group who played @entity15 five days a week for a month			1
@entity3 's @entity4 games sold 19 million units on the basis of health claims - new research hints that they do speed up your brain , but not all of its functions the thirty two volunteers were recruited via advertisements in local newspapers in @entity26			1
they were split into two groups , one of which played @entity15 for 15 minutes a day , five days a week for four weeks			2
the other group played @entity4 for the same period			1
measures of cognitive functions were taken before and after the training			0
there was a slight increase in speed and certain cognitive functions in the group that had played brain age - although there was no increase in important brain functions such as attention span			1
it 's also uncertain , say the researchers , whether the games have any long - term effect - and they admit they need to repeat the results with a larger group			0
' this result indicated that there is a possibility which the elderly could improve executive functions and processing speed in short term training , ' says the paper , published in the journal @entity58			2
' the results need replication in large samples			0
long - term effects and relevance for every - day functioning remain uncertain as yet			0
' the disclaimer for the article says that dr @entity67 - the neuroscientist who created the games - was involved in the research , but that none of the other scientists at @entity72 had competing interests			0
the publication in a reputable scientific journal also hints that the research is credible , .			0

games speed up brain function after a month
no effect on attention span or other brain functions
two groups played either @entity4 or @entity15 for equal periods
short study hints brain speed can be improved *quickly*
