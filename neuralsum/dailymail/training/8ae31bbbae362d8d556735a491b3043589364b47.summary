@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
@entity11 got me the sack i 'm so pleased for @entity11 , getting a dream move to his hometown club @entity15			1
what a remarkable story going from the lower leagues to playing in a @entity19 and the @entity20 aged 32			2
dream come true : @entity22 striker @entity11 is set to join hometown club @entity15 from @entity24 i remember all - too well how deadly he can be as a striker			1
he put a nail in my coffin as manager of @entity29 back in 2009 when he grabbed a winner playing for @entity31 at the @entity32 on a tuesday night			1
@entity11 had already scored once and , with the score tied at 2 - 2 and the game going into the final five minutes , i thought we were set for a point			1
but suddenly , out of nowhere , he smashed in a half - volley from around the penalty spot and won them the game			2
soon after that , i watched him play for rovers at @entity43 and he integrated into midfield and linked up play in a similar style to what is required by @entity48 at @entity15			1
he played wide , he played deep , and he played on the shoulder			2
over the years i 've seen him play at all levels and he is more than just an old - fashioned , six foot two , @entity52 - style centre forward			2
with @entity15 in the @entity20 they will need a lot more players to cope with the games , the injuries , suspensions and general fatigue , especially in the season following a @entity19			1
it will be a big test for @entity48 and at only £ 4million i think he has got a bargain			2
all smiles : @entity11 celebrates scoring for @entity31 - a goal which saw @entity66 sacked as @entity29 manager back in 2009 @entity68 needs to ditch rooney forget the reputation			1
the decision on @entity72 has to be made on current form			1
people are wondering how to fit @entity75 into the @entity22 team			1
there 's no question , he needs to be playing ahead of @entity72			1
he should be one of the first names on the team sheet playing behind @entity82 , just as he 's done so well for @entity15			1
the boy is not a winger			2
his game has changed and for @entity15 he has been quite outstanding playing in that no 10 role with his speed , quality in the final third , willingness to track back and help defensively			1
forget reputation : @entity72 needs to be ditched for @entity75 based on current form he can retain possession and keep the ball moving with one and two touch play and , for me , we should start with him against the @entity97 who lack pace and speed at the back			1
@entity72 has been a magnificent player but , like @entity101 , he started at such a young age and it looks to me as though his best days are now behind him			1
the pace has gone and the fuel - injection system he had in his engine is now a steady four - door family saloon			2
start @entity75 and anything can happen			1
@entity109 , brutal @entity110 to get £ 50m for @entity110 - a centre half who is a liability , trying back - heels and flicks , running out of position , charging around everywhere - is nuts			1
last year , i watched a @entity118 versus @entity120 match and with @entity118 winning 4 - 0 there was a 50 - 50 on the half - way line between @entity110 and a young 19 - year - old called @entity123 who had just come on as a substitute			1
it was a 50 - 50 with the ball five yards away and both running at full speed			0
good riddance : @entity66 is glad to see @entity110 departing @entity118 after witnessing the @entity131 's challenge on young @entity120 player @entity123 last year it was the last minute of this @entity134 derby			1
the game was already over			0
what did @entity110 do ? he lifted his elbow and smashed the young whippersnapper straight across his forehead and sparked him out , in a similar fashion to the way @entity143 took down @entity144 on saturday , on the @entity146 canvas			1
incredibly the referee let him get away with it while @entity123 was unconscious on the floor			1
that day i was doing commentary for @entity152 and the @entity154 mist descended one again			0
i so badly wished i would have had the chance just to play one more time with him in the opposition team			0
going commando my bags are packed with old kit and boots , my toothbrush and one set of training kit , for a week 's visit to @entity166 in west africa where i will be taking a coaches training programme for the charity ' @entity170			1
' i 'm taking no clothes apart from the ones i 'm travelling in			0
instead my bag is filled with colouring pens , colouring books , balloons , old football kit and old trainers for when i visit the orphanages in one of the poorest countries in the world			0
there is not even any room for my underpants			0
in this mad world of football management it helps me appreciate just how lucky we all are when you meet these people with big smiles on their faces , enjoying life			0
in the mornings , at half - past seven , the children walk miles to school			0
there are no big four - by - fours or cars running the kids about			0
talent : @entity203 player @entity202 signed a four - year contract with @entity118 in january at half - one in the afternoon , in the boiling sun , they calmly walk back and then from three o'clock onwards , on every spare patch of land , you see kids , children and youths playing football everywhere			1
and i mean , everywhere			0
it 's no wonder @entity166 won the 2011 @entity216 and that @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 have set up academies to attract the best young players			1
when i was over there before , i once met a 15 - year - old lad who was built like @entity224 , could run like @entity225 and was a machine in central midfield			0
it is no wonder in january the player , @entity202 , now 18 , signed a four - year professional contract with @entity118			1
these boys are so fit , so strong			0
they are hungry and technically , after playing on orangey - grey shale for so many years , they are top drawer			0
they play football seven days a week , they have no laptops , @entity239 , and very few @entity240 can not wait to see those lovely smiles once again			0
my week ... last monday i went to see @entity242 win promotion in the @entity245 play - off final against @entity246			0
i was fortunate enough to get tickets sat right behind the dugouts as a guest of the @entity250			0
instead of taking advantage of the hospitality , i was there five yards behind the dugout eating a hot dog as long as my arm filled with onions and tomato sauce			0
i 'm not sure the prawn sandwich brigade and the substitutes sat on the bench appreciated the waft as i sat there munching away			0
at the end of the game both the ecstasy and the agony were just 10 yards away on either side			0
to my left it was the wives and families of the @entity242 players taking photos , hugging , singing and dancing			0
they new there would be new deals offered , bonuses triggered and bigger contracts			0
but just 10 yards to my right , the @entity280 family and friends sat there dejected , proud of their partners and sons but overwhelmed , several with tears streaming down their cheeks			0
the players were probably wondering whether they were going to have new deals for next season			2
the great rise : @entity242 have been promoted for the sixth time in nine years down in front of me @entity293 was hugged by everybody as he proudly squeezed every player and member of staff with smiles from ear - to - ear			2
i looked across to the @entity280 bench and it was handshakes and pats on the back all round			0
their manager @entity305 has done a fantastic job on a small budget and he is definitely a manager to look out for			0
he stood there quietly and calmly , taking the defeat diplomatically and in the right spirit			0
i imagine he was probably trying to work out already which players he would be letting go on free transfers to freshen up his squad , ready for the challenge he faces next season			1
this is the reality of lower - level football where most players now get one - year deals and it is make or break			0
@entity242 's players are now probably off on two - week holidays , with plenty of sunshine , knowing their future is firmly secured			2
the @entity280 players will be ringing their agents hoping to get a club			2
it 's a mad world in football .			2

@entity11 set to sign for hometown club @entity15
striker has risen through the leagues and is now an @entity22 *international*
@entity11 got @entity66 the sack as @entity29 boss by scoring for @entity31 against the @entity341 in 2009
@entity22 striker @entity72 should be dropped for @entity75
@entity0 pleased @entity110 is set to leave @entity118 after witnessing @entity131 's nasty challenge on young @entity120 player @entity123 last season
