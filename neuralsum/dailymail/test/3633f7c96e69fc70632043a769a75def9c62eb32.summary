punched , elbowed , apparently bitten			0
just another night for an @entity1 striker			1
yet this was not @entity3 circa 2010 to 2014			2
this was @entity5 involved in bust - up after bust - up as he shed blood and sweat against great rivals @entity10 at the @entity11			1
when @entity1 allowed @entity3 to sign for @entity13 on july 1 , 2014 , @entity12 may have fretted about losing his street fighter			1
not for long , however			0
just nine days later , he bought @entity5 from @entity16 , and the @entity17 international looked every bit as aggressive on tuesday night			1
blood pours from @entity5 's face during the @entity23 quarter - final first leg in @entity10 @entity24 and @entity1 striker @entity5 continually clashed on tuesday night during the tie @entity5 proved he is a warrior with his performance against @entity10 , just as @entity3 was @entity3 gives @entity27 , who is now his @entity13 team - mate , a stern look during a @entity23 tie nobody elbowed their way to the top quite like @entity3 – from the streets of @entity35 , to @entity36 , to @entity37 – and the same went for @entity5 in the @entity23 quarter - final first leg			1
the 28 - year - old came to blows with defenders @entity24 and @entity42 – drawing blood after an elbow to the face from the former , while receiving a punch , and possibly a bite , from the latter			1
@entity50 pundit @entity49 said @entity5 ' made a meal of things ' yet the evidence was there for all to see , pouring down his face			2
round two awaits at the @entity57 next week			0
yet @entity5 was as culpable as he was the victim			2
he committed seven fouls , compared to 11 in total by @entity10 , and it was more than any player has managed in a @entity23 game against the winners of @entity64 before			2
the long - ball tactic by @entity1 was not working , nor did @entity5 have enough pace to beat a defence boasting @entity68			1
he had zero shots on or off target , completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes , and lacked the pace and darting runs @entity3 delivers			2
yet this was about playing rough , rather than scoring goals , and he played the role of warrior to perfection			0
so much so that @entity12 – albeit riskily – substituted his partner , @entity78 , after 77 minutes instead of the man on thin ice			1
@entity5 clashed with @entity42 during the quarter - final first leg and played rough all night @entity5 's heat map , who had zero shots on or off target , and completed just 18 passes over 90 minutes @entity5 , despite failing to conjure a chance on tuesday night , is a natural striker			1
his cv includes @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity16 , and he was imposing at every club			0
fifty - six goals in 132 appearances in @entity17 's @entity93			0
fifty - three in 110 in @entity95 's @entity94			0
all that added to @entity12 feeling @entity5 was next in line at a forward - thinking club that have a history of great strikers which stretches back decades			1
no sooner had @entity102 left in 2007 for @entity103 , for example , than @entity102 was replaced			0
@entity105 turned up , alongside @entity106 , and @entity102 was old news			0
@entity105 was deemed irreplaceable , until those in @entity10 were introduced to @entity109 the same year @entity110 left			0
then , when @entity109 left for @entity112 in 2013 , it was @entity3 's turn , and so on			2
@entity105 signed for @entity1 in 2006 and scored 74 goals in 175 appearances in @entity116 in five years @entity109 kept up an impressive 0.76 goals - to - game ratio during his time with @entity1 from 2011 @entity121 proved a great striker for @entity1 as the club produce top forwards continually no sooner had @entity102 left in 2007 for @entity103 than @entity102 was replaced at @entity125 @entity5 's tattoo on his lower back was on show , and it read : ' what does n't kill you makes you stronger			1
' trouble for the striker is his ink – written in @entity134 – is backwards and has grammatical mistakes so makes no sense ! the @entity36 club do n't fret losing a striker			2
they regroup , consider it a temporary inconvenience , and buy a replacement			0
they have been doing so ever since @entity121 in 1999 , and @entity144 the year before , and even further still			0
it 's the @entity1 way			2
it is not unlike what has happened with goalkeepers at the club			0
@entity150 left in 2011 and was replaced by @entity151 , only for the previously - anonymous @entity152 to take over this year			0
much like their record with strikers , it looks inspired , as the 22 - year - old who cost € 16million ( £ 11.5m ) thwarted @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 almost single - handedly			0
and so when @entity12 lost @entity3 to @entity13 , he signed @entity78 and @entity5			1
and if the latter 's showing against @entity10 is anything to go by , then the @entity1 manager bought just about the closest thing he could find to replace the @entity167 's joint - top goalscorer			1
@entity5 and @entity24 exchange words during a heated battle between the @entity10 rivals on tuesday night @entity5 shows off his battle wounds during the match between the two great @entity10 rivals			1

@entity1 0 - 0 @entity10 : read @entity176 's report from @entity36
@entity5 was battered and bruised during the quarter - final tie
the @entity1 striker came to blows with @entity24 and @entity42
@entity1 have a history of buying great strikers after *selling* their forwards
@entity12 has bought the closest thing to @entity3 he could find
@entity5 *differs* from @entity3 in style of play but proved as aggressive
he and @entity78 can become *suitable* replacements at @entity1
