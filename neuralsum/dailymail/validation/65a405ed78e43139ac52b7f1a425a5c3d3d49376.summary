just a few months ago , @entity0 was on the verge of being allowed to leave @entity2 , having made little more than a fringe impact on the club 's first team			1
a loan at @entity8 side @entity7 saw him play five games in the second tier this november and december , before @entity11 recalled him following an injury to club captain @entity13			2
@entity0 was expected to be cover for @entity15 , and his first three games saw him play a total of 13 minutes , coming off the bench late in the game on all three occasions			0
@entity0 has become a key member of the @entity2 first team after almost being allowed to leave statistically the @entity23 is the leading defensive player in the @entity24 since his return to @entity2 @entity0 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the @entity29 but an injury to @entity15 has handed the 23 - year - old @entity23 his chance , and @entity0 has emerged as a real talent , and a crucial part of @entity2 's recent good form			1
in fact , based on statistics alone , @entity0 is unquestionably the best defensive player in the @entity24 since he returned to the club			0
since his first start , in @entity2 's 2 - 1 win over @entity40 on december 28 , the holding midfielder has shown terrific reading of the game and positional sense , making more successful interceptions than any other @entity24 player			2
@entity0 has also brought a degree of steel to the famously lightweight @entity2 midfield , topping the charts for duels won			1
@entity11 admitted he had expected to release @entity0 at the end of the season @entity0 has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he 's injured @entity0 almost went on loan to @entity58 at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on in fact , the @entity23 midfielder has dominated the @entity24 in personal battles , his 97 duels won an astonishing 21 more than any other player			1
when it comes to tackling the @entity29 ' academy product is only second in the list , four behind @entity70 full back @entity71 , but he is still comfortably ahead of the next best midfielder , @entity73 @entity72			0
as a result , @entity2 have lost just twice in the league since the turn of the year , and have climbed to third in the @entity24 table , leaving some fans to ask whether @entity0 is the player the @entity29 have been missing since the departure of @entity81			2
certainly he is not yet the finished article , as shown in an unconvincing display against @entity84 in the @entity85			0
the @entity23 midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot @entity15 in the pecking order @entity2 have been linked with @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 but might feel @entity0 is enough @entity0 played five games on loan at @entity7 this season but has returned to be a first team regular but @entity11 , so long linked with a string of defensive midfielders - the most recent lists including @entity89 , @entity88 ad @entity95 - seems to think that @entity0 has a future at the club , offering him a new long - term contract last month			1
whether he holds onto his place when @entity13 returns , or can hold off competition from those potential summer signings , remains to be seen			0
but what is certain is that @entity2 have , statistically at least , found themselves the @entity24 's leading defensive player on current form .			0

since coming back from loan , @entity0 tops defensive statistics
injuries to @entity15 and @entity13 forced @entity0 to return
defensive midfielder has most interceptions , duels won and tackles
@entity11 had been *prepared* to let @entity0 leave on a free
wenger has been urged to *buy* new holding midfielder for several years
but @entity29 boss has now given @entity0 a new contract instead
