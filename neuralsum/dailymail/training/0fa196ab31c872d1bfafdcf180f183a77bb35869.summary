shivering for 10 minutes can burn as many calories as an hour 's exercise , new research suggests shivering with cold may be as effective as exercise at helping us stay slim , new research suggests			0
both produce hormones that stimulate the creation of calorie - burning ‘ brown fat ’ , a study has shown			1
once thought only to be present in babies , scientists now know adults also possess ‘ good ’ brown fat - and those with more of it are slimmer			0
while ‘ bad ’ white fat stores energy , brown fat burns it up			1
around 50 grams of brown fat can burn up to 300 calories per day , the same amount of energy stored by 50 grams of white fat			1
the new research involved exposing volunteers to increasing levels of cold until , with temperatures down to around @entity29 , they began to shiver			0
‘ we identified two hormones that are stimulated by cold - irisin and fgf21 - released from shivering muscle and brown fat respectively , ’ said study leader dr @entity30 , from @entity32 ’s @entity31			2
‘ these hormones fired up the energy - burning rate of human brown fat cells in the laboratory , and the treated fat cells began to emit heat , a hallmark of brown fat function			1
’ around 10 to 15 minutes of shivering produced as big a rise in irisin as an hour of moderate exercise , the scientists found			0
in the laboratory , irisin and @entity50 together transformed white fat cells into brown fat cells over a period of six days			1
‘ excitement in the brown fat field has risen significantly over the last few years because its energy - burning nature makes it a potential therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes , ’ said dr @entity30			2
‘ white fat transformation into brown fat could protect animals against diabetes , obesity and fatty liver			2
glucose levels are lower in humans with more brown fat			0
’ the findings are reported in the latest edition of the journal @entity73			0
shivering and exercising both produce hormones that stimulate the creation of calorie - burning brown fat as part of the study , the cold - exposure volunteers were also asked to pedal an exercise cycle for an hour			1
the moderate level activity generated the same amount of irisin from muscles as shivering for 10 to 15 minutes			0
‘ from a clinical point of view , irisin and @entity50 represent a cold - stimulated hormone system , which was previously unknown , and may be harnessed in future obesity therapeutics through brown fat activation , ’ said dr @entity30 .			2

both stimulate the creation of calorie - burning ' brown fat '
' @entity94 ' white fat stores energy - while ' good ' brown fat burns it up
50 grams of brown fat can burn up to 300 calories per day , the same amount of energy stored by 50 grams of white fat
when we are cold we produce the hormones irisin and @entity50 - these fire up the energy - burning rate of brown fat cells
