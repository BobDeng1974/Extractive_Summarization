by @entity0 published : 14:09 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 14:14 est , 17 november 2013 support : major general @entity2 said the @entity3 still has a ' duty of care ' towards @entity5 and his family @entity8 's top commando has vowed to stand by the sergeant convicted of executing a severely - wounded @entity11 prisoner , declaring : ' once a marine , always a marine			1
' major general @entity2 risked a clash with military top brass by issuing the message of support on the day the 39 - year - old - identified only as @entity5 - was found guilty of murder			1
his comments to the 8,300 - strong @entity20 are at odds with those from general sir @entity23 , the head of the @entity3 , who said there should be ' no leniency ' for @entity5 because of his ' heinous crime '			1
maj gen @entity2 , who led @entity27 in @entity28 at the time when the unknown captive was shot dead , said : ' we will hold true to our duty of care and responsibility for this member of the corps family , and his family , as he serves out his sentence			1
' our mantra of " once a marine , always a marine " is not conditional			0
' his stance was revealed as a poll revealed that more people believed the commando should be treated with clemency than thought he should receive a mandatory life sentence for the murder			0
some 47 per cent of those quizzed by @entity50 agreed that @entity5 should be given a shorter sentence because ' the law should make an exception for a soldier serving on the frontline '			2
however , 35 per cent think he should receive the full life term			0
maj gen @entity2 is under pressure from his officers to submit statements of mitigation to the court martial when @entity5 is sentenced next month dec. some commanders in the marines want him to be treated like soldiers convicted of killing civilians in @entity67 during the @entity68 , who were not dismissed from the military			1
this would allow the sergeant , who serves with @entity73 , to receive his salary and his family to retain other perks			0
a @entity20 officer said : ' if @entity5 's family are evicted from their home and forced on to benefits , it will make them victims and cause an outcry			2
' charged : @entity83 was found guilty of murder after footage capturing the death of a @entity11 insurgent was unearthed his unit commanding officer , lieutenant colonel @entity88 , is expected to submit an ' operational effectiveness impact statement ' to the court setting out @entity5 's chances of returning to duty after completing his sentence			1
a defence source said : ' these are usually the key to dissuading military judges from issuing sentences demanding dismissal from service , so it is very important whether the chain of command of @entity20 says he has a future in uniform			0
' @entity5 killed the insurgent in september 2011 near the end of a ' tour from hell ' , during which 23 servicemen from @entity27 were killed and the @entity11 hung the blown off limbs of maimed @entity8 troops in trees as ' trophies '			1
he shot the unknown man in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol , then taunted him : ' @entity121 , you c * * *			2
' his badly injured victim had been found with an @entity125 assault rifle and grenade after an @entity128 helicopter blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a @entity8 base			0
harrowing film and audio recordings of the ' field execution ' in a cornfield , captured on a helmet - mounted camera worn by a comrade , were played to a court martial			0
@entity5 denied murder , claiming he thought the insurgent was already dead			2
his co-accused , known as @entity143 and @entity144 , were cleared of the charge			0
short sentence : major general @entity147 who led the elite commandos in the @entity149 , has called for leniency when @entity5 is sentenced the commando , a 15 - year veteran who had done six tours of @entity67 , @entity154 and @entity28 , was found guilty after a two - and - a - half week trial			1
he is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the @entity158			0
several retired commanders , including major general @entity147 , who led the elite commandos in the @entity149 , have called for leniency when @entity5 is sentenced			1
supporters believe the seven - strong board of military personnel who decide his fate must take into account the unimaginable horror , stress and provocation he endured in the weeks leading up to the killing .			0

major general @entity2 gave his support the day @entity5 was convicted
risked a clash with the head of @entity3 who wants ' no leniency '
