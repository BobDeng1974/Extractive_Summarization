president @entity0 brushed aside sharp @entity2 criticism on monday , suggesting that all nations spy on each other as the @entity5 and @entity6 expressed outrage over alleged @entity9 eavesdropping on @entity11 diplomats			1
@entity9 analyst - turned - leaker @entity12 , believed to still be at @entity16 's international airport , applied for political asylum to remain in @entity18			1
@entity18 president @entity21 , in a statement he acknowledged sounded odd , told reporters in @entity16 that @entity12 would have to stop leaking @entity9 secrets if he wanted asylum in @entity18 - and he added that @entity12 seemed unwilling to stop publishing leaks of classified material			1
at the same time , @entity21 said that he had no plans to turn over @entity12 to the @entity9			1
a statement purportedly by @entity12 and posted monday on the @entity30 website criticized @entity0 for ' using citizenship as a weapon			2
' the statement could not be independently authenticated as being from @entity12 himself			2
@entity30 is the anti-secrecy group that has adopted @entity12 and his cause			2
but he also suggested such activity by governments would hardly be unusual			0
' we should stipulate that every intelligence service - not just ours , but every @entity2 intelligence service , every @entity55 intelligence service , wherever there 's an intelligence service - here 's one thing that they 're going to be doing : they 're going to be trying to understand the world better , and what 's going on in world capitals around the world , ' he said			2
' if that were n't the case , then there 'd be no use for an intelligence service			0
' the latest issue concerns allegations of @entity9 spying on @entity2 officials in the @entity6 news weekly @entity74			1
@entity5 president @entity75 on monday demanded that the @entity9 immediately stop any such eavesdropping and suggested the widening controversy could jeopardize next week 's opening of trans - atlantic trade talks between the @entity9 and @entity2			1
' we can not accept this kind of behavior from partners and allies , ' @entity75 said on @entity5 television			0
@entity86 : @entity5 president @entity75 expressed his outrage monday over alleged @entity9 spying on @entity2 limbo : @entity45 whistleblower @entity12 is trapped in @entity16 's @entity90 while awaiting asylum @entity6 government spokesman @entity92 told reporters in @entity94 , ' eavesdropping on friends is unacceptable			1
' he declared , ' we 're not in the @entity97 anymore			0
' even before the latest disclosures , talks at the upcoming free - trade sessions were expected to be fragile , with disagreements surfacing over which items should be covered or excluded from an agreement			0
the @entity9 has said there should be no exceptions			2
but @entity5 has called for exempting certain cultural products , and other @entity2 do not appear eager to give up longtime agricultural subsidies			2
@entity0 said the @entity2 ' are some of the closest allies that we have in the world			2
' but he added , ' i guarantee you that in @entity2 capitals , there are people who are interested in , if not what i had for breakfast , at least what my talking points might be should i end up meeting with their leaders			1
that 's how intelligence services operate			0
' nonetheless , @entity0 said he 'd told his advisers to ' evaluate everything that 's being claimed ' and promised to share the results with allies			0
meanwhile , the @entity128 news agency said a @entity18 consular official has confirmed that @entity12 had asked for asylum in @entity18			1
@entity128 cited @entity131 , the duty officer at the @entity133 's consular office in @entity16 's @entity90 , as saying that @entity12 's representative , @entity134 , handed over his request on sunday			2
@entity12 , in legal limbo , is believed to have been in the airport 's transit zone since his arrival from @entity140 on june 23			0
the @entity9 has annulled his passport , and @entity142 , where he has hoped to get asylum , has been giving off mixed signals about offering him shelter			1
psst : pres. @entity0 wants @entity12 returned to @entity9 soil , a request @entity149 president @entity21 will deny - provided @entity12 stops leaking info mr. worldwide : @entity12 has become a household name around the world for leaking top secret @entity45 documents pertaining to the agency 's surveillance activities ' if he wants to go somewhere and there are those who would take him , he is welcome to do so , ' @entity21 said			1
' if he wants to stay here , there is one condition : he must stop his activities aimed at inflicting damage on our @entity9 partners , no matter how strange it may sound coming from my lips			0
' @entity0 said ' there have been high - level discussions with the @entity18 ' about @entity12 's situation			1
' we do n't have an extradition treaty with @entity18			0
on the other hand , you know , mr. @entity12 , we understand , has traveled there without a valid passport , without legal papers			0
and you know we are hopeful that the @entity18 government makes decisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions that law enforcement has			0
so i can confirm that			0
' @entity21 did n't mention any @entity12 effort to seek asylum in @entity18 , and spokesman @entity193 declined to say what the @entity18 response might be			1
@entity21 insisted that @entity12 was n't a @entity18 agent and that @entity18 security agencies had n't contacted him			1
three @entity9 officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to publicly discuss the @entity12 case , said @entity47 's efforts were focused primarily on persuading @entity18 to deport @entity12 either directly to the @entity9 or to a third country , possibly in eastern @entity2 , that would then hand him over to @entity9 authorities			1
in a sign of the distrust the latest report had revealed , the @entity6 government said it had launched a review of its secure government communications network and the @entity11 's executive , the @entity207 , ordered ' a comprehensive ad hoc security sweep			0
' no thanks : @entity142 president @entity217 appears to want no part in granting @entity12 asylum in his country trapped : @entity45 leaker @entity12 is stuck in @entity16 's @entity221 , terminal e , sleeping a hotel for transit passengers at the transit zone inside @entity9 secretary of state @entity226 said monday he did n't know the details of the allegations , but he still played them down , maintaining that many nations undertake various activities to protect their national interests			1
@entity226 failed to quell the outrage from allies , including @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity235			0
a spokesman for @entity237 , the president of the @entity238 , said , ' the @entity11 has demanded and expects full and urgent clarification by the @entity9 regarding the allegations			2
' according to @entity74 's report , which it said was partly based on information leaked by @entity12 , @entity45 planted bugs in the @entity11 's diplomatic offices in @entity47 and infiltrated the building 's computer network			0
similar measures were taken at the @entity11 's mission to the @entity249 in @entity48 , the magazine said			0
it also reported that @entity45 used secure facilities at @entity253 headquarters in @entity49 to dial into telephone maintenance systems that would have allowed it to intercept senior officials ' calls and internet traffic at a key @entity11 office nearby			0
as for @entity12 , @entity261 national security spokeswoman @entity260 said the @entity261 wo n't comment on specific asylum requests but reiterated its message to all countries that he ' needs to be expelled back to the @entity9 based on the fact that he does n't have travel documents and the charges pending against him			1
' regarding possible effects on @entity9 interactions with @entity18 , she said it remains the case ' that we do n't want this issue to negatively impact the bilateral relationship			1

@entity2 nations are outraged over allegations the @entity9 conducted surveillance in their borders
@entity18 @entity21 has told @entity12 to keep quiet , will consider asylum bid
@entity142 does not appear to be interested in harboring @entity12
