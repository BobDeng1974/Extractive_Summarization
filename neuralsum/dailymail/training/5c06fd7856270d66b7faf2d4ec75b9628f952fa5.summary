the malicious attempt by rapper @entity1 to humiliate his ex-friend @entity2 as semi-literate is reminiscent of how @entity5 ’s early reading difficulties were once exposed on television			1
@entity5 stalked off the set after being asked to read a passage about himself from a book handed to him – deliberately upside down			1
how right he was to do so			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 call out @entity2 feud : @entity2 ( left ) was asked to read a passage from @entity14 by rapper @entity1 ( right ) now mr @entity1 – in a parody of the current celebrity ice - bucket challenge – has offered to donate $ 75,000 to charity if @entity2 is able to read a long passage from a @entity14 book in public			1
that followed an apparent struggle by the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world to articulate a few printed words for an advertisement			2
even rappers should know better			0
a feud has been brewing since @entity2 ended his part - buddy , part - professional relationship with @entity1 , who he had helped into the boxing promotion business			1
but this latest barb is the lowest of low blows			0
the way it used to be : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 used to be friends before their falling out whatever anyone thinks of @entity2 – and there are times when his flash arrogance and vulgar displays of his wealth can grate on the best of us – he does not deserve a shot even cheaper than this particular rapper ’s half - dollar name			1
@entity2 ’s contribution to boxing and the financial advancement of sportsmen generally will be remembered long after mr @entity1 ’s charmless recordings have been consigned to the studio waste - bin , @entity2 has reacted by posting photographic images of the two cheques he has received for his most recent fights – against @entity58 and @entity59 – totalling more than $ 72million			1
also , as he prepares to bank tens of millions more by defending his world titles and unbeaten record in next month ’s @entity63 re-match with @entity59 , he says : ‘ @entity64 has blessed me with an unbelievable talent , fast feet , fast hands , unbelievable defence and a very , very sharp mind			0
hip - hop artists , they come and go			0
under pressure : @entity2 was given a torrid time by @entity59 when they first met last may let 's do it again : @entity2 and @entity59 will meet again in their rematch in @entity63 next month but may i suggest a way for the greatest of this time to deliver a rebuke as simple , dignified and damningly effective as when @entity80 walked off camera			2
@entity2 should challenge @entity1 to sing @entity83 ’s @entity82 on television			1
my informants in the music industry tell me the sound would be akin to that of a rottweiler being strangled			0
@entity90 has proved to himself how rewarding dedication to boxing can be			1
by all accounts @entity94 ’s successor to prince @entity95 submitted to a rigorous training regime prior to winning his first world title			2
the close , hard - fought and thoroughly deserved victory over tough welterweight champion @entity100 in @entity101 has opened up enriching possibilities for @entity90			1
before he cashes in big - time against @entity103 – perhaps at @entity104 next spring – and maybe @entity105 in @entity106 , let him not forget all the hard work which has made all this possible			0
on top of the world : @entity90 ( right ) outpointed @entity100 to win the @entity111 welterweight title in @entity112 dedication : @entity90 has waited a long time for his chance to win a world title and he seized it with both hands brook himself is talking about the sacrifices he has made recently			1
the accolades which are following his gallant victory against the odds should serve as constant reminders that prize - fighting is too short a career for any of it to be wasted on nights out on the town			0
the @entity130 gave this likeable young man a hero ’s homecoming from @entity134 and @entity94 is where he plans to make a voluntary defence of his title in december			0
the opponent that celebratory night will not be as formidable as @entity100 last week – let alone @entity103 or @entity105 next year – but there is too much at stake now for @entity90 to make the easy mistake of treating anyone lightly			2
the long - awaited statue of @entity144 is fast approaching completion			2
the figure of @entity147 ’ @entity148 poised in the split second after landing the booming left with which he floored @entity5 on his way to winning the @entity152 stands nine - feet tall in the studio of sculptor @entity154			2
it is now beginning the five - month bronzing procedure prior to an unveiling in @entity144 ’s home city of @entity159 next april a campaign for the real former world heavyweight champion to be thus immortalised followed the erection in @entity159 of a statue of celluloid boxer @entity164			1
@entity166 reverend @entity165 said : ‘ tell them @entity168 was fictitious			0
’ video : watch the @entity144 statue being sculpted ahead of its unveiling next year mirror : a statue of @entity144 , showing him throwing a left hook against @entity5 , is almost complete project : sculptor @entity154 expects the @entity144 statue to be ready in april and it will stand in @entity159 several years of fund - raising and political manoeuvring later , that anomaly is about to be corrected			1
the process was tragically interrupted when the original sculptor died suddenly			0
@entity154 , the runner - up in that selection process , took over , admitting that he feels ‘ the artistic pressure to create the best piece i can put out there			0
’ so powerful and commanding is the result that one of @entity144 ’s daughters was moved to weep when invited to see that statue			2
no doubt there will be more tears for the @entity193 when he takes his eternal place on the site of the old @entity197 arena which he christened with his 1967 victory over @entity200 .			0

rapper @entity1 attempted to humiliate former friend @entity2
he asked him to read a passage from a @entity14 book in public
@entity1 was alleging that @entity2 is semi-literate
his actions were reminiscent of @entity5 's early reading difficulties
those were exposed on television and were equally shameful
@entity90 's world title win proved how rewarding dedication can be
@entity90 beat @entity100 to win the @entity111 welterweight title in @entity112
@entity144 's statue is set to be ready by next april
