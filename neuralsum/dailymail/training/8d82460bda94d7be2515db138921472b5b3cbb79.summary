@entity1 tv host @entity0 said more in hope than expectation on the eve of @entity5 2014 that its biggest stars had to deliver			1
he was well aware the most - hyped players in @entity8 four years ago - @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - managed just two goals between them , and the entire @entity1 had flopped as a result			1
but , to the delight of @entity19 and millions of armchair fans , this time has already been different – and how			0
@entity21 : ronaldo biggest stage : @entity9 celebrating his goal that crucially put @entity25 2 - 0 up against @entity26 at the @entity27 on sunday clincher : @entity29 netting the header that gave @entity31 a 2 - 1 victory over @entity33 on saturday local hero : @entity35 celebrates with @entity5 team - mate @entity36 after scoring the penalty that gave his side a 2 - 1 lead in the @entity1 opener against @entity41 on thursday time to shine : now it is @entity10 's turn to deliver as @entity44 prepare to face @entity45 the greatest players in the world have set the stage alight in the first few days with brilliant goals from @entity35 , @entity50 , @entity29 , @entity9 , @entity14 , @entity51 , and a midfield masterclass from @entity53 as @entity31 broke passing records against @entity33			1
if anything is going to get the current best player on the planet @entity10 in the mood as he makes his long - awaited first appearance in @entity5 against @entity45 on monday evening , it ’ll be the sight of his peers getting so much acclaim and adulation in a stunning start to the tournament			1
for all the talk of @entity9 ’s attempts to emulate @entity69 this summer , @entity10 has the ego to believe he should leave @entity5 this summer as the greatest player of all - time by leading @entity44 to their first @entity1 – something even @entity73 could n’t manage			1
he ’s had to overcome a torn thigh muscle and tendonitis in his knee in the build - up to the @entity1 , in less than four weeks after helping @entity78 win the @entity79			2
but surely nothing will stop the £ 80million world footballer of the year trying to put on a special show in @entity44 ’s opening game in @entity84 against @entity45 in @entity85			1
@entity10 was actually applauded into the media room as he finally arrived an hour late on sunday to talk about the @entity45 clash			2
he tried to be modest but it did n’t really work			0
finisher : @entity50 scored two as @entity91 beat @entity92 in their opening game on sunday the @entity94 : @entity14 netted a brace as @entity96 beat @entity97 5 - 1 sprinter : @entity51 was also amongst the goals in their demolition of the world champions ‘ i 'm 100 % , ’ he assured them			1
‘ i 'd like to be at 110 %			0
if i 'm not feeling well , i 'm the first to tell the coach i ca n't play			0
if i feel anything during the match , i 'm the first to tell the coach			0
‘ i can make a difference , but i ca n't carry the whole team			0
i just want to help			0
on monday we have a match against a favourite to win the @entity1 , @entity45			2
' look at my statistics and my cv – i have nothing to prove			0
my career has been great so far and i just want that to continue			0
’ until now the game ’s biggest names have n’t let the @entity1 down			2
it started on opening night when @entity5 ’s @entity35 rescued the hosts after they trailed to @entity41 , equalising with a shot that fizzed in - off the post and then scoring a match - winning penalty			1
struggle : @entity10 and @entity9 had a difficult time of it at the last @entity1 , with the @entity129 forward managing just a single goal against @entity131 and the @entity132 failing to score strife : @entity11 had a terrible time of it in @entity8 , failing to score in four appearances , whilst @entity12 saw more red cards for @entity5 than he managed goals if that was impressive , what @entity51 and @entity14 did to holders @entity97 on friday was nothing short of sensational			1
they scored twice each – van @entity14 ’s looped header will be talked about for years to come – as @entity96 won 5 - 1			1
over the weekend , it was more of the same			0
@entity29 headed @entity31 ’s winning goal against @entity33 – why is it always him ? at 35 , @entity53 was man - of - the - match as @entity31 recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent , the highest ever in a modern @entity1 game			1
@entity50 scored twice for @entity91 , and then @entity9 lit up the @entity27 after a sluggish start with a tradsemark solo slalom to score against @entity26 in @entity25 ’s 2 - 1 victory			1
pass master : @entity53 recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against @entity33 all smiles : @entity10 was in high spirits during a press conference ahead of the crucial opening game expectation : but he knows there will be real pressure on him to deliver the goods it will be extremely difficult to top – but it ’s @entity10 up next and anything is possible			2
he 's the most expensive footballer in the world at £ 80million			0
he 's the current world footballer of the year , ahead of @entity9			2
but taking the @entity1 by storm would top it all and he knows it , regardless of the state of his body .			0

@entity9 , @entity29 and @entity35 have all delivered so far at the @entity1
the @entity132 superstar scored a stunning goal in their 2 - 1 victory over @entity26
@entity29 scored @entity31 's winner in their 2 - 1 victory over @entity33 in @entity178
@entity35 netted two vital goals as @entity5 beat @entity41 3 - 1 on the opening day
@entity10 is now set to enter the fray as @entity44 take on @entity45 on monday
many stars such as @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14 struggled to perform at the @entity186 in @entity8
