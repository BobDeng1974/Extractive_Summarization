by @entity0 for @entity1 a globe - trotting couple took their three children out of school for a once in a lifetime gap year travelling the world			0
expats @entity9 and @entity11 from @entity12 took @entity13 , 16 , @entity14 , 14 , @entity15 , 10 - and their campervan - on a £ 50,000 adventure last year			1
they 've just finished their year - long trip after covering more than 50,000 miles through some of the most exotic and beautiful landscapes in the world			1
@entity9 and @entity11 with children @entity13 , 16 , @entity14 , 14 , and @entity15 , 10 - and their campervan along the way they rode camels in the desert , washed elephants in @entity28 , had a mud bath in @entity30 and visited a host of historic sites			1
but while @entity11 and @entity9 wanted their children to see their world , they did n't let their education suffer			1
the couple got permission from the @entity40 authorities to take the kids out of school as they made sure they kept up with school work on the road			1
@entity9 , 44 , said : ' it was a great chance for our children to see a bit of the world and learn about different cultures			1
' we knew that if we did n't do it now , our oldest son @entity13 would have had too much going on at school and we 'd never get to do it all together			2
' the family owned a bakery in their home town but moved to the rural region of @entity59 in @entity40 in 2007 so their three children could learn to speak another language			1
the @entity11 boys in the @entity64 desert during their year - long trip of a lifetime the couple made sure the kids kept up with school work on the road they went to @entity30 and @entity71 in the campervan before ditching it back in @entity30 and getting flights to @entity28 , @entity75 , @entity76 and other parts of the @entity78			1
they then flew back to @entity30 to get the van before travelling through @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			1
they spent months at a time in each location , making friends and immersing themselves in the culture			0
the last part of their trip saw them travel back to @entity94 where they met up with family in perth.the epic journey cost just shy of £ 15,000 - excluding the cost of the campervan			2
their daily costs rose slightly during their trips to @entity103 , @entity28 and the @entity78 as they had to leave their mobile home behind			2
however , they brought the overall budget back in line by reducing how much they spent while living in @entity83			2
@entity15 , 10 , pictured with a camel in the @entity64 ( l ) and father @entity11 on top of mountain in @entity85 ( r ) ' our budget was £ 8 per person per day for food , accommodation costs , travel and everything else , ' said @entity9			1
' although the campervan helped keep this down			0
' taking the kids out of school could have had a huge impact on their education if it were n't for the fact that @entity11 and @entity9 made sure they would n't fall behind during their year out			1
in order to do this they bought books which covered the curriculum their children would have covered during the same year at school			0
head teachers should only authorise leave of absence in exceptional circumstances			1
if a head teacher grants a leave request , it will be for the head teacher to determine the length of time that the child can be away from school			0
leave is unlikely , however , to be granted for the purposes of a family holiday as a norm			0
source : school attendance , @entity155 advice for maintained schools , academies , independent schools and local authorities they also had to write to education chiefs in @entity40 to get permission to take them out of school for 12 months			1
once they got the go ahead , the only challenge left was getting them to do the work on the move			0
@entity9 said she and @entity11 had the ' fanciful ' idea of getting their kids out of bed at 7am every morning and working from 8 to 10am but that notion did n't last long			1
she said : ' that lasted a week			0
in all honesty , even a little less than that			0
it might have worked for some families but it was a disaster for ours			0
' we forgot the plain old fact that teenagers have a changing body - clock and mornings are , basically , tough			0
' we nagged for a while , being new to it all , but by the time we hit @entity30 , our first country , we began to relax			0
' @entity9 said the boys were given the task of breaking up what they had to learn and working out when they 'd cover each section			2
amazingly , they stuck to their plan and kept up their schoolwork throughout the trip			0
@entity9 said : ' the less we pushed the more they did			2
the nagging lingered for a couple of months but we could see that , as it died away , the motivation rate increased			0
' the former solicitor now teaches @entity203 while @entity11 , 47 , is an agricultural engineer who now works on a goat farm			2
the couple are childhood sweethearts who have just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary			0
@entity13 , 16 , plays the guitar during a jam sessions with locals in the @entity64 @entity9 , who used to own a bakery with @entity11 , embraces an elephant in @entity28 @entity15 and @entity213 washing the elephant @entity28 , where they visited halfway through the trip after graduating , they went on a round - the - world trip that was supposed to last for 18 months			1
however , the adventure was cut short when they were involved in a horrific crash in @entity103 when the car they were travelling in was hit by a lorry behind them			0
the collision caused their car to career off the road and into a tree			0
@entity11 escaped serious injury but @entity9 broke almost every bone in her body , suffered a punctured lung and spent almost three months in hospital			1
the experience changed the couple 's outlook on life , making them more determined to do the things they want to when they want to			0
@entity9 said : ' since the accident we 've done a lot of things on the spur of the moment			2
' the @entity11 children are now getting ready to start back at school in @entity40 after their year of sightseeing			1
@entity9 said : ' the kids are excited to see their friends back at school and tell them what they 've been up to			1
they 're also going to do a presentation in the village hall for the locals			0
' they family ditched the caravan after @entity84 for more exotic trips to the @entity78 and @entity263			2

@entity9 and @entity11 from @entity12 took @entity13 , 16 , @entity14 , 14 , and @entity15 , 10 on trip
@entity267 owned a bakery in @entity269 but moved to @entity59 , @entity40 , in 2007
@entity40 education chiefs gave them permission to take the kids away
