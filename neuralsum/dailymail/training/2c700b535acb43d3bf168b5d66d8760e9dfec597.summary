on the day @entity0 signed @entity1 they were playing at @entity2			1
@entity3 was asked about @entity1 ’s reputation for attracting trouble at his former @entity7 club			1
despite his sky blue surroundings he did not hold back			0
‘ i spent three - and - a - half hours just talking him through @entity0 , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a massive club and it ’s a different club			0
it ’s a family club with strong family values and ethics over many years			0
behaviour is very important here			0
’ at @entity2 , it is fair to say there was a sharp intake of breath			0
@entity3 may not have intended a slight but it was certainly taken that way			1
city executives felt he had implied that @entity0 possessed morals that were not present elsewhere			1
@entity1 would be safer with them than he was at @entity2			2
it was not that @entity2 did not care about @entity1 ’s behaviour			2
there was no issue around ethics , or values			0
the problem was the player , not the club			0
@entity3 could talk @entity1 through the @entity0 way for three - and - a - half months , let alone three - and - a - half weeks , and it would make no difference			1
if @entity1 wants to let off a firework , he lets off a firework			2
if @entity1 wants to throw darts , he throws darts			2
and if @entity1 wants to post a message against racism , he inadvertently insults the @entity58			1
and that was n’t @entity3 ’ only miscalculation that evening			2
‘ he ’s a very bright boy , he ’s very clever , ’ he said of @entity1			2
really ? is he ? he posted the phrase ‘ jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew ’ as a message of inclusivity			0
he might not be the intellectual titan of @entity3 ’ imagination			0
@entity1 has struggled on the pitch for @entity0 and is becoming more of a problem off it , too the @entity0 striker was criticised for swapping his shirt with @entity75 during half - time of the loss to @entity77 @entity78 apologies for racist tweet indeed , the only reason @entity1 ’s post does not appear to have attracted the same widespread disgust as @entity84 ’s anti-semitic quenelle gesture is because he is presumed to be almost childlike in his perspectives			1
whereas @entity84 ’s message was insidious and knowing , @entity1 gormlessly failed to spot an ideological timebomb in what he thought was a positive statement			1
his post was brightly coloured and the cartoon man shared his name			0
on realising his mistake he deleted and apologised			0
still , the damage is done , the @entity96 machine is in motion and @entity0 will have to deal with the fall - out , whether @entity1 gets a ban , or merely a fine and another round of negative publicity			1
his problems are their problems now			0
@entity1 invites trouble and , through him , so do @entity0			1
@entity3 can not say he was n’t warned			0
@entity1 is sent off against @entity104 , one of four red cards he received when he was a @entity2 player , and the @entity108 striker walks around @entity109 with the @entity111 team in 2012 the striker holds up a fire safety poster after fireworks were famously set off in his bathroom			1

@entity3 thought @entity1 would behave better at @entity0
he is now discovering that @entity1 is the problem , not his clubs
the striker wanted to tweet *anti-racist* message but ended up inadvertently offending @entity58 people after posting a picture of @entity125
he *quickly* realised and deleted it but the damage was done
@entity0 will have to deal with fall - out - a ban , a fine or just *bad* publicity
