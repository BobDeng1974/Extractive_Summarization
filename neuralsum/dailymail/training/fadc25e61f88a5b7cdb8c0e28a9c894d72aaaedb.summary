from crawling under homes in search of the deadly brown snake to saving pets from giant pythons – it ’s just another typical day for @entity6			1
it all started at the age of five when he showed his mum his catch of the day			2
not only was it the first snake he had ever caught , it was one of the world ’s most venomous - the copperhead			1
but that close encounter with disaster did n't deter the boy from the @entity21 from turning his backyard hobby into a career as a qualified snake catcher			1
' there are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that 's dangerous but its all relative to risk management			2
‘ but i 've been doing it for a long time and i ca n't put my finger on what attracted me to them but i have always loved chasing snakes since i was little			2
' and i love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when i catch them			1
' mr @entity6 , who owns the @entity54 24/7 , has been catching snakes since the age of five @entity6 's colleague @entity57 recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job			1

‘ there have been some interesting calls lately			0
on thursday , i got called to a home after their @entity77 alerted its owner that there was a medium sized carpet python in the kennel			2
‘ when i arrived , they had taped up the door to trap it but it is n’t the first time i have come across snakes in kennels and it certainly wo n’t be the last			2
‘ just recently , someone texted me a picture of an @entity93 corn snake – i thought it was a joke but it was actually sitting on an old couple ’s front porch so i had to get down there right away			2
' but by the time i arrived , it was n't there anymore			0
luckily they ’re not venomous but they ’re classed as a pest and pose a huge threat to our wildlife , which we must find urgently before she lays any eggs			0
’ he was called to a home in the @entity21 to save a pet cat from this python which was waiting to pounce mr @entity6 has been quite busy during the summer season , with number phone calls and texts daily snake catcher @entity6 came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the @entity21 despite many years of experience , mr @entity6 said he has never had any training			1
‘ a lot of people ask me how i ’ve learnt to catch snakes but i ca n’t remember a day where i ’m not catching them – i ’ve been doing it for a long time and i guess it was just self - taught			1
‘ growing up , @entity129 played a passion that i had			0
i remember watching his shows and thinking “ that ’s what i do too ! ” and it stirred me on from there			0
’ while mr @entity6 makes his job sound too easy , he said he has had some of the scariest moments			1
‘ just recently , i did something really stupid – i crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake			2
despite many years of experience , mr @entity6 said he has never had any training and was self - taught the family @entity77 alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel			1
the owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until mr @entity6 arrived to remove it ‘ crawling on my tummy , trying to locate it which in hind sight – i should n’t have done – but when i looked up , it was right above my head , looking at me like “ what are you doing ? ” so i slowly backed out			1
‘ the owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it ’s what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable			0
‘ it was stupid and dumb – i managed to catch it safely but it was n’t the end of it			0
the owner ’s @entity77 was coming at me so i had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy			2
' after mr @entity6 catches the reptiles , he releases them back into the wild			1
' we try to release them in the same geographical area and i do n't like to take them too far away from where they were found			0
but it has to be a far distance away so they do n't come back , ' he said			0
' but if it 's a venomous snake , a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas			0
' when it doubt about spotting a snake , mr @entity6 suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance the avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and has n't stopped since mr @entity6 said the most venomous snakes @entity210 should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes , which are the second most venomous snakes in the world			1

' send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it ’s venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them , ' he said			0
' if the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms , it 's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us			0
‘ be smart about it because 90 percent of the time , people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away			0
‘ all snakes want to do is get away but if it does n’t feel it can escape , it ’ll strike – so be sensible when you spot them			0
