more than a thousand miles away from the nearest nation , at the bottom of the @entity1 , lies a ghostly graveyard of ships and aircraft sunk in the height of the @entity7			1
more than 40 @entity9 ships and 250 aircraft have their final resting place at the bottom of the @entity13 , 1,118miles from @entity14 , making it the largest of its kind			1
the vessels and airplanes went down during a two - day attack by the @entity21 forces known as @entity22 , on february 16 - 17 , 1944 , destroying cruisers , auxiliaries and merchant ships which severely injured @entity9 's presence in the @entity1			1
seventy - one years later the underwater grave is a popular site for divers as fish invade the decayed war wreckage			2
@entity49 , 49 , from @entity50 , visited the site in may last year as turtles swam among the debris			0
he said : ' dives were typically about one hour , sometimes a little longer on the shallower wrecks			0
we would typically do three days per day and i clocked up over 30 dives during my trip			0
' whilst i had gone to @entity13 fully prepared to photograph wrecks , what surprised me was the diversity of subject matter on each wreck site			2
as well as the wreck itself and the fascinating contents of the holds , they are festooned in coral , which makes for some fantastic photo opportunities			0
' without a doubt this stunning destination , with almost 70 charted wrecks , is truly the world 's wreck capital - particularly in view of the sheer number of wrecks , their preservation and stunning condition			0
