neighbor @entity35 held @entity4 ( pictured here in august 2014 ) hostage in her home , at times firing his gun at her and pistol whipping her head and face			1
she later required 50 stitches and 60 staples @entity4 said that the warning signs were there but @entity5 police had kept assuring her that it would be ok , and that they could n't help her because @entity8 did not have a criminal record			1
@entity46 , @entity4 ' attorney , found in his research that in 1990 @entity8 was convicted in @entity48 of possession of a firearm during a crime			1
' [ they ] should have done their homework and found out about his record			0
that changes the whole game here , ' he said			0

that 's what frustrates me , ' he said			0
@entity4 said that the warning signs were there but @entity5 police had kept assuring her that things would be ok			1
a complaint to her landlord led to @entity8 's being asked to move and that brought things to a head @entity46 ( right ) , @entity4 ' attorney , argued : ' this never would have happened had the police done their duty ' after he discovered @entity8 had a previous firearm conviction ' i 've reviewed the documents extensively , personally , that pertained to the case			1
and i feel our officers acted very responsibly , very professionally , ' he said			0
he cited one report in which an officer ' told @entity105 she could get a protective order against @entity8 if she felt her or her son 's safety was at risk '			2
@entity69 said that options were presented that she chose not to pursue , but admits that ' looking back , we could be critical of everyone 's actions			0
@entity4 has said that she did n't pursue the protective order because @entity8 lived in the adjoining townhouse sharing a dividing wall , so she was not sure it would have helped			2
for nearly a year @entity4 endured harassment from her neighbor , much of which was religious in nature			2
@entity4 is @entity123 and @entity8 , a @entity124 , would write @entity126 passages in chalk on her porch			2
he once climbed a ladder and put a @entity124 fish symbol on her bedroom window , and also scratched the symbol into her car			0
in a report filed after the harrowing incident at @entity4 ' home that led to @entity8 's suicide , officers noted that the messages were not threatening , just ' odd '			1

the report said that @entity4 claimed to have called them six times regarding @entity8 , through police refute that having documented three calls			2
@entity4 maintains that every time she contacted police they would speak to @entity8 and assure her that everything would be ok			1
' they would come over and they would come into my house and they would sit down and we would talk and i would just kind of explain i did n't feel safe			0
and they would go next door and talk with him			0
and then they would come back and reassure me and let me know everything would be ok , ' she said			0
things came to a head when @entity4 complained to their landlord who told @entity8 to move out			1
the day of his eviction was the day he broke into her house to murder her - april 1 , 2014			0
speaking on wednesday , @entity46 said : ' this never would have happened had the police done their duty			0
' acknowledging that police are not usually liable for criminal conduct , he said that this case is different because of the ' special relationship ' of trust that had developed between @entity4 and officers			2
@entity69 acknowledges that what happened was a tragedy and his heart goes out to all the victims			0
@entity69 said that this a case of ' an evil person [ that ] chose to do an evil crime ' and was not the result of inaction by his police department			1
