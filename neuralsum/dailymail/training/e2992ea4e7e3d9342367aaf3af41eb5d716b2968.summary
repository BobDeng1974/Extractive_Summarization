by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 28 february 2013 for @entity4 , like for many observant @entity3 women , manicures have long posed a religious problem			1
with prayers five times a day , and a pre-prayer ritual that requires washing the hands and arms , traditional fingernail polish has been mostly off limits because it prevents water from making contact with the nails			1
a new ' breathable ' nail polish by a @entity17 company , @entity16 , is changing that			1
the company and some @entity3 say the polish is the first of its kind because it lets air and moisture pass through to the nail			1
a craze has built up around it with @entity3 women in recent months after an @entity30 scholar in the @entity31 tested its permeability and published an article saying that , in his view , it complies with @entity3 law			2
manicures for all ! a craze has built up around @entity38 nail polish after an @entity30 scholar in the @entity31 tested its permeability and published an article saying that , in his view , it complies with @entity3 law ' it 's huge , ' said @entity44 , a 35 - year - old who had n't polished her nails in many years but immediately went out and bought the product in five colors , including a bright pink , a burgundy and a mauve			1
i feel more feminine — and i just love it			2
' the news of @entity16 's breathable polish has in recent months spread quickly from woman to woman and over the @entity57			1
it also has given @entity59 a boost in sales of the product , called @entity38 , for oxygen and moisture			2
the nail polish now stands as one of the final life achievements of @entity16 , a @entity17 chemist and entrepreneur who developed it to create what he billed as a healthier alternative to traditional nail enamels , which block the passage of moisture and oxygen to the nail			1
he died suddenly on saturday at the age of 57 after suffering internal hemorrhaging , and is being laid to rest on wednesday in his hometown of @entity80			1
inspired idea : @entity16 , late founder of the @entity17 cosmetics company @entity16 , who died on saturday , invented ' breathable ' nail polish @entity59 has been the recipient of several business leadership awards for taking an enterprise that he started in 1983 , when @entity17 was still under communist rule , and turning it into an international success			1
a @entity17 award he received last year praised him for ' proving that @entity17 is a country where innovative technologies go hand - in - hand with beauty			2
' today his company has shops in almost 50 countries , including one at @entity98 in @entity99 and boutiques in malls from @entity102 to @entity103 to @entity104			2
though the @entity3 holy book , the @entity106 , does not specifically address the issue of nail polish , some @entity30 scholars have said that water must touch the surface of the nail for the washing ritual to be done correctly			1
some @entity3 women might put nail polish on after finishing the last prayer of the day before going out , and then take it off again before dawn prayers			1
they can also wear it during their periods , when they are excused from the prayers , but some find it embarrassing to do so because it could signal they are menstruating			2
some simply do n't want to take the trouble of getting a manicure that wo n't last long			2
' it was a big headache for me to put it on only for five days , so i did n't wear it for a long time , ' said @entity44 , who was born in @entity129 but now lives in @entity130 , @entity131 , where she is a teacher of preschool and kindergarten level children			2
' this was a huge breakthrough for me			2
we are supposed to cover up , but nowhere does it say " do n't be fashionable			0
" ' nobody was more surprised by the splash it made with @entity3 than @entity59 himself			0
' i do n't think there is a single @entity3 living here , ' @entity59 said in an interview with the @entity0 nine days before his death at his factory in @entity80 , near the border with @entity149			0
' we did n't even think about this			0
' @entity59 began about four years ago to develop the formula for the breathable enamel , which uses a polymer similar to that in the newest generation of contact lenses			0
word - of - mouth success : the news of @entity16 's breathable polish has in recent months spread quickly from woman to woman and over the internet @entity59 said the chemical formula is ' tricky ' and ' quite expensive ' to produce , and that the profit margin on @entity38 is not high			1
however , he said he was determined to develop a breathable polish knowing that consumers are ever more focused on health and expecting them to welcome a varnish that would let the nail breathe			1
low profit margin : @entity59 said the chemical formula is ' tricky ' and ' quite expensive ' to produce he said the enthusiastic @entity3 reaction to the product began after an @entity30 scholar , @entity174 , published an article on his blog in november declaring it permissible			0
the result was a ' serious increase in the sale ' of @entity38			0
@entity59 said the company was unable to immediately meet all requests for orders , but that the phenomenon was so fresh that he did n't yet have any figures on sales			0
' but it looks very promising , ' @entity59 said			0
' we were very surprised and very happy with that			0
' @entity174 , director of education and outreach with the @entity191 of @entity192 in @entity131 , said he decided to study the matter because @entity3 women had already been discussing the product in online forums			0
there was uncertainty over whether it would be ritually compliant , and they were n't getting any answers			0
' so i decided to go ahead and write an article on this because i know how important it is for @entity3 women around the world , ' @entity174 said			0
the research involved putting the @entity38 polish and a standard polish on coffee filters , letting them both dry , and then putting water drops on top of each and seeing if the moisture seeped through			1
in the case of the traditional nail polish it did not , but it went through the @entity38 polish and even wet a second filter below			1
@entity174 said he has gotten an enthusiastic reception to his opinion from women — not only because they are reveling in the chance to accessorize with colorful varnishes			0
' usually when men give a religious ruling or verdict , they tell women that something is not allowed , ' @entity174 , 31 , said			0
' they felt so good that someone was finally telling them " you are allowed to do this			0
" ' new possibilities : @entity3 women are reveling in the chance to accessorize with colorful varnishes there are still some outstanding questions , however , about how breathable the nail polish will be if multiple coats are used — say a clear bottom coat , two layers of color plus a top coat , as is common			1
before his death , @entity59 was working to answer this question and gather other data on the product			0
the company 's other managers are deep in mourning over losing @entity59 but plan to continue that effort			0
@entity59 had insisted on having more data before he felt he could responsibly promote the varnish as being compliant with @entity30 law			0
@entity30 has multiple schools of thought and no universally agreed - upon figure — such as the pope of the @entity263 — to issue final rulings on religious legal interpretation			1
so it 's not clear if all @entity30 scholars would agree on @entity38 's permissibility , or on whether wearing nail polish at all is compatible with @entity3 notions of modesty .			1

the nail polish now stands as one of the final life achievements of @entity16 , who died suddenly on saturday at the age of 57
