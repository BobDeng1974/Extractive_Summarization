by @entity0 published : 04:59 est , 2 august 2013 @entity2 : 06:04 est , 2 august 2013 despite a rise in credit card fraud , the most commonly - used pin is still 1234 , with 1111 and 0000 coming in second and third			1
research has revealed that one in ten codes is so obvious it would take criminals just one attempt to guess it correctly , while more than a quarter of the codes are used so often they can be guessed in fewer than 20 attempts			1
the study from @entity15 analysed 3.4 million four - digit codes and found that many people use birth years as @entity19 , making it even easier for hackers to guess a code simply by finding out a person 's age from online accounts			1
a study by @entity15 has uncovered the most commonly - used pins used worldwide			1
the research also reveals it would take a hacker just 20 attempts to be able to guess more than a quarter of secure @entity19 and 10 per cent of codes could be guessed first time 1			1
6969 research from security experts @entity32 has found that 17 per cent of people in @entity36 have been victims of credit card fraud , at a cost of £ 1,076 per person			1
last year the total cost of credit card fraud in the @entity43 from criminals hacking and cloning cards was £ 42.1 million and the total amount of fraud committed through all credit card - related crimes was £ 388 million			1
there are 10,000 possible combinations for four - digit pin codes using 0 to 9			0
@entity15 used data from previously released password tables and security breaches			0
by combining the password databases , researchers filtered the results to show just four - digit numbers and were able to analyse 3.4 million four - digit passwords			0
they discovered that all of the possible 10,000 combinations - from 0000 to 9999 - were found in the data list			0
the most popular password was 1234 , but the amount of times this number occurred ' staggered ' the researchers - almost 11 per cent of the 3.4 million passwords were 1234			2
this pin was also more popular than the 4,200 codes at the bottom of the list combined			0
the next most popular 4 - digit pin was 1111 , used more than 6 per cent of times			2
in third place was 0000 at two per cent			2
data genetics compiled a list of the top 20 passwords and found that 26.83 per cent of all the passwords in the list could be guessed by attempting these 20 combinations			1
the researchers also noted that many of the high - frequency pins could be interpreted as years because many began with 19			2
this chart shows the ratio of 19 + to non- 19 + codes			0
every single 19 + combination appeared in the top fifth of the list the researchers said : ' statistically , with 10,000 possible combinations , if passwords were uniformly randomly distributed , we would expect these twenty passwords to account for just 0.2per cent of the total , not the 26.83 per cent encountered			2
' the more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables and the study found that 10 per cent of @entity19 could be guessed correctly first time			1
more than 20 per cent could be guessed by using just five attempts and statistically , one third of all codes could be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations			1
the data found that the least - used code was 8068 with just 25 appearances in 3.4 million - far fewer than random distribution would predict			0
the majority of @entity19 in the @entity15 list began with the number one , which may be due to the popularity of using birth years			1
zero and two were also popular			0
the higher the number , the lower its frequency the researchers also noted that many of the high - frequency pins could be interpreted as years because many began with 19 , for example , 1984 , 1967 and so on			2
this could be a birth year or anniversary and if a hacker can guess someone 's age , or even obtain it through birth records or online accounts , for example , they could make an educated guess at the pin			0
in fact , every single 19 + combination appeared in the top fifth of the list			0
the majority of @entity19 in the @entity15 list began with the number one , which may be due to the popularity of using birth years			1
the numbers zero and two were also popular			0
the research found that the higher the number from 0 - 9 , the lower its frequency at the start of the code			0
a recent study found that a pet 's name is the most common online password			0
as many as one in six people uses their pet 's name as a password			0
one is six @entity43 admitted accessing someone else 's account by guessing the password , with partners the most common target , followed by exs			2
one in ten people has also guessed a work colleague 's password , the study by @entity164 found .			1

study reveals the most commonly used and easiest to hack pins
it claims that 10 per cent of @entity19 can be guessed in just one attempt
research finds 17 per cent of people in @entity36 have suffered identity fraud
credit card fraud cost the @entity43 more than £ *388million* last year
