researchers have uncovered a massive shift in the @entity3 's plates they say created the ' perfect storm ' for life on @entity3 to explode - and reveals @entity6 was once attached to @entity7			1
the cambrian explosion is one of the most significant events in @entity3 's 4.5 - billion - year history , and the surge of evolution led to the sudden appearance of almost all modern animal groups			1
fossils from the cambrian explosion document the rapid evolution of life on @entity3 , but its cause has been a mystery			1
a new analysis from @entity23 at @entity24 suggests a deep oceanic gateway , shown in blue , developed between the @entity28 and @entity29 oceans immediately before the @entity31 sea level rise and explosion of life in the fossil record , isolating @entity35 from the supercontinent @entity26			0

the sudden burst of new life is also called ' darwin 's dilemma ' because it appears to contradict @entity47 's hypothesis of gradual evolution by natural selection			2
the paper by @entity51 of @entity23 at @entity23 's @entity52 , published in the november issue of @entity54 , a journal of the @entity56 , suggests a major tectonic event triggered the rise in sea level and other environmental changes that accompanied the apparent burst of life			0
' at the boundary between the @entity65 and @entity31 periods , something big happened tectonically that triggered the spreading of shallow ocean water across the continents , which is clearly tied in time and space to the sudden explosion of multicellular , hard - shelled life on the planet , ' said @entity51 , a research professor at the @entity24 and a professor in the @entity75			0
beyond the sea level rise itself , the ancient geologic and geographic changes probably led to a buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere and a change in ocean chemistry , allowing more complex life - forms to evolve , he said			0

the new paper is the first to integrate geological evidence from five present - day continents — @entity6 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity7 — in addressing paleogeography at that critical time			1
@entity51 proposes that present - day @entity6 was still attached to the southern continents until sometime into the cambrian period			2

@entity51 proposes that present - day @entity6 was still attached to the southern continents until sometime into the cambrian period			2
current reconstructions of the globe 's geography during the early @entity31 show the ancient continent of @entity35 — the ancestral core of @entity6 — as already having separated from the supercontinent @entity26			2
in contrast , @entity51 suggests the development of a deep oceanic gateway between the @entity28 and @entity29 ( ancestral @entity122 ) oceans isolated @entity35 in the early @entity31 , a geographic makeover that immediately preceded the global sea level rise and apparent explosion of life			0
' the reason people did n't make this connection before was because they had n't looked at all the rock records on the different present - day continents , ' he said			0
the rock record in @entity7 , for example , comes from the very remote @entity135			0
' people have wondered for a long time what rifted off there , and i think it was probably @entity6 , opening up this deep seaway , ' @entity51 said			0

' it appears ancient @entity6 was initially attached to @entity7 and part of @entity103 , not to @entity156 and @entity104 , as has been widely believed , ' he said			1

' although the new analysis adds to evidence suggesting a massive tectonic shift caused the seas to rise more than half a billion years ago , @entity51 said more research is needed to determine whether this new chain of paleogeographic events can truly explain the sudden rise of multicellular life in the fossil record			0
' i 'm not claiming this is the ultimate explanation of the @entity31 explosion , ' @entity51 said			0
' but it may help to explain what was happening at that time			0

cambrian explosion is one of the most significant events in @entity3 's history
surge of evolution led to the sudden appearance of modern animal groups
new theory claims @entity6 was initially attached to @entity7 and part of @entity103 , not to @entity156 and @entity104 , as widely believed
