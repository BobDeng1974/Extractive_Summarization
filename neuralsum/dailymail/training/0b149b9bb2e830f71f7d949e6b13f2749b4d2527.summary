from the moment @entity0 was first whirled around the floor by charming dancer @entity3 in the first series , @entity5 was a hit with the @entity8 public			2
as the newsreader stepped out in a succession of gorgeous , glittery gowns , wowing the judges with her fancy footwork , and opera singer @entity15 foxtrotted through the series with super-confident @entity17 , viewers fell in love with the graceful dancers , elegant routines and beautiful outfits			1
tasteful and wholesome , it was — at last — the perfect prime - time saturday night show and exactly what viewers wanted from the @entity27 : a family - friendly programme that appealed to all generations			1
fast forward ten years and the show appears radically altered			1
on saturday , former boyband star @entity35 performed a rumba with @entity34 , who was dressed in a racy , skin - tight costume that was so raunchy that it sparked a wave of criticism			1
yet this was n’t an isolated incident			0
this year ’s show bears little resemblance to the first series			2
gone are the older professional dancers , gone are the reserved , romantic routines , gone are the elegant gowns			1
today ’s dancers are more likely to be seen thrusting around on their partner ’s thigh in a cut - away , bottom and breast - baring leotard			0
such is the contrast that images from 2004 look not just outdated , but as if they belong in an entirely different era			2
it is hard to imagine in the current series the ankle - length , long - sleeved purple dress worn by @entity15			0
nor can one imagine the explicit , overtly - sexual dances of last weekend having a place in the show of ten years ago			1
peachy poise : @entity77 looks radiant in a ball gown during the 2004 series of @entity5 darling dancing : @entity80 pulls a provocative pose alongside dancing partner @entity82 this year @entity83 keeps it classy in a white dress in 2004 , while @entity86 shows off her legs in 2012 on saturday , professional dancer @entity89 danced the paso doble with pop star @entity91 with such hip - swirling passion that he split his trousers , @entity88 led a knicker - flashing routine with @entity96 star @entity95 , while the encounter between @entity34 and @entity35 seemed far more suitable for after the watershed			1
or on a rather different kind of tv channel			0
as one viewer wrote on a fan forum : ‘ @entity34 is looking more and more like an adult film star each week			1
@entity104 too frantic for a rumba , no “ dancing ” from @entity35 whatsoever and a really awkward semi-smutty atmosphere			1
’ the slide into sleaze has been so evident that even dancer @entity110 claims to have noticed , saying over the summer that the glamour of @entity5 was starting to curdle			0
‘ we dancers are used to wearing tiny costumes			0
but on the show they are getting shorter , ’ said ms @entity110			1
‘ i understand some people may feel uncomfortable , especially the celebrities			0
’ not that @entity110 seems at all uncomfortable herself in skimpy costumes			0
her outfits on the show are modest compared to her calendar , now an annual release from several of the female dancers			1
@entity110 ’s 2015 calendar shows her naked , with her peachy buttocks exposed insouciantly , while her colleague @entity126 poses in underwear throughout hers — the black , strappy sort , often teamed with thigh - high boots that call to mind @entity131 as a prostitute in @entity134			0
@entity34 strikes various erotically charged poses wearing extremely little			1
it is n’t just the dancers who are showing off acres of flesh on this series of @entity5			0
pop stars @entity42 , 23 , and @entity91 , 25 , have worn costumes that are little more than spangled bikinis			0
@entity42 has at least worn a dress — though one so short that the knickers had to be sewn in			0
in previous years , when the @entity27 chose more mature contestants , such outfits simply were n’t considered			2
tv presenters @entity83 , 53 , @entity149 , 52 , and @entity151 ’s @entity150 , 51 , looked undeniably glamorous without pouring themselves into scraps of glittery material			0
as recently as 2010 , @entity154 , 46 , and @entity155 , 64 , were the grand dames in gloriously glittering dresses			0
lower the tone : @entity159 oozes elegance in a blue number for the 2005 show , while @entity163 struts her stuff in a skimpier number in 2013 but after @entity168 , 31 , the @entity167 star turned pop starlet who writhed in a cage in a see - through dress in 2011 , @entity5 must have decided no series was complete without at least one half - dressed pop starlet			1
but the push for provocative attire is n’t coming from the contestants			0
@entity178 actress @entity177 , 30 , found the brevity of the costumes an embarrassment last year			0
she said at the time : ‘ i kind of turn up on friday and see how much material is in the dress and nine times out of ten i get some added			0
’ for a young actress to plead for an extra bit of fringing to spare her blushes says a lot about the show ’s wardrobe policy			2
though even those who do n’t complain can struggle with the lack of clothing , as actress @entity196 , 26 , discovered in 2011 when a wardrobe malfunction left her crying bitterly after falling out of her dress			2
the @entity27 denies that the costume policy has changed , however			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it is as it has always been			0
it has not become any raunchier			2
we have the same lady in charge of wardrobe and there have not been any orders to sex it up			0
@entity212 poses in a peach number along with dance partner @entity17 for the 2005 show @entity154 takes to the floor in a short sparkly number during the 2010 show alongside @entity218 ' the costumes are an important part of the glamour of the show			2
’ perhaps the @entity27 ’s lack of concern over the sauciness of the show can be explained by a look at the ratings figures			2
strictly started regularly beating @entity229 in 2011 , helped by @entity168 , @entity196 falling out of her dress and eventual winner @entity230 from @entity232 going shirtless			2
but while @entity5 ’s ratings remain ahead of the @entity237 talent contest , its viewing figures have fallen gradually since 2010 — since , in fact , the outfits and dances got racier			1
fitting with the raunchier image , the show ’s professional dancers have also been replaced by younger , thinner blondes			1
in have come a phalanx of @entity248 hotties — @entity249 @entity34 , @entity250 @entity110 and @entity251 @entity126 , whose svelte bodies and blonde hair means they are virtually indistinguishable			1
@entity34 wore a succession of bikinis with beads when dancing with rugby player @entity257 last year , and is continuing to ram home her sexpot image			1
but then , while such provocative attire and sexy routines might have been out of place ten years ago , this series ’ racy rumbas , outrageous outfits and blonde professional dancers have turned what was a family favourite @entity268			1
if you think they 're racy on tv , clock their calendars ! exposed : @entity110 ( left ) leaves little to the imagination in her calendar , while @entity34 strips down provocative : @entity126 poses in lacy underwear in an advert for her latests calendar			1

in 2004 show *epitomised* elegance with ball gowns and reserved routines
but since 2011 outfits have become shorter as dances become raunchier
@entity35 and @entity34 *'s* latest routine attracted criticism
