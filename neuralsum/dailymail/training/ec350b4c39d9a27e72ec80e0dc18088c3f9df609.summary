' ms @entity77 , who worked as a flight attendant for seven years , says she is accustomed to the less than desirable behaviour displayed by some passengers			1
' i did this stuff but not to this extent			0

the @entity32 photos , which are submitted anonymously by passengers and flight attendants , are posted to @entity42 and @entity43 bare feet are a common occurrence on tray tables , walls and stretched into other passengers ' personal space this man obviously thought he was still in his own lounge room , rather than an airline lounge it 's not even clear what this passenger was thinking as she slept with what looked to be a see through jacket recent photos in the past month shows a suit jacket over the back of a man 's seat , a potty in the aisle , people sleeping in inappropriate areas and dirty nappies stuffed in the seat pockets			1
images to have been previously uploaded include people resting their feet near other passengers ' heads , clipping their finger and toenails , eating smelly food and leaving a wake of destruction behind them			2
' probably one of my favourites is one with the feet coming through the middle of a seat , ' ms @entity77 said			2
the inspiration for @entity37 came when the former flight attendant started receiving photos from people who read her blog , @entity154 of a @entity155			1
' that focuses on me obviously ranting about poor passenger behaviour and telling stories i experience , ' she said			2
' then i thought i 'd branch off on social media using photos			0
now i have the photos to back up what i 've been talking about on my blog			0
' they prove i 'm not exaggerating - this is how ridiculous people are on air planes			0
' this woman may have run out of time for a pedicure , but the next best thing was a @entity174 job in her plane seat everyone knows plane seats are n't the most comfortable thing to sleep in , so this passenger decided the galley floor was the best place to catch up recent photos in the past month on @entity37 include this shot of a passenger 's legs resting high in the air surely this is n't comfortable ? one passenger was photographed folding their legs up on the tray table this man treated the plane like his office when he draped his suit jacket over the back of his chair the @entity42 page has drawn attention from passengers right around the world and currently has more than 250,000 likes			1
