by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 08:04 est , 23 january 2014 a mother ’s concern about a mark on her son ’s forehead led to her being diagnosed with skin cancer			1
@entity8 , 43 , took her son @entity9 to the family gp after she became worried about a spot on his hairline			1
after @entity9 ’s growth was found to be benign , dermatologists inspected a mark on mrs @entity8 ’s neck which had been irritating her for three months			1
shock : @entity8 initially took her son @entity9 to the family gp about a spot on his hairline			1
this was found to be harmless but she was diagnosed with skin cancer at the same time tests confirmed she was suffering from a rodent ulcer , otherwise known as basal cell carcinoma , a type of skin cancer			1
mrs @entity8 , who works in accounting , said : ' the dermatologist had finished explaining that @entity9 ’s spot was harmless and then asked whether there was any history of skin cancer in my family			1
' i said , " no , but there is this strange mark on my neck "			2
' the lump had been on my neck for six months and had been itching and bleeding for about three months			1
but it was n’t incredibly painful and i had n’t thought a great deal about it			2
' the dermatologist took one look at it and asked me to go back and see my gp urgently			0
the gp took a sample of the tissue and discovered it was cancer			2
' @entity9 was with me in the examination room when he told me what he ’d found , and my first thought was how he would react to the news			1
chance : after @entity9 's growth was found to be benign , dermatologists inspected a mark on mrs @entity8 's neck which had been irritating her for three months more than with 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas are diagnosed each year			1
cases of this form of cancer , which is treatable by surgery , have risen by 80 per cent in a decade			2
it is the most common form of skin cancer but the least dangerous - but must still be taken seriously			1
basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads and can easily be treated and cured when discovered early			1
but the surgery can be potentially disfiguring , especially the cancer has grown for a while			0
' he was just 13 at the time and cancer is such a strong word			0
it was almost as if my life was flashing before my eyes			0
' the cancerous lump was removed a week after it was discovered			0
mrs @entity8 , of @entity79 , said : ' taking @entity9 to the doctor ’s surgery turned out to be a very good idea			1
if it had been left for any longer , it could have spread			0
' cancer ’s not something you want to leave to get any worse , and if it had gone unexamined for very much longer , my health could have been at serious risk			0
' she believes the cancer could have been caused by a heat - conducting silver chain which she wore around her neck			2
she said : ' i had used sunbed in the past but never excessively - perhaps on the odd occasion for a couple of weeks before heading out to a holiday in the sun. on holiday i always tried to be careful using sunscreen because i hated to burn			0
' i used to wear a thick silver chain which heated up quite considerably when i was using a hair - drier , or even when i was over the oven cooking			0
' i suspect the heat damaged my skin cells on that part of my neck over time , leading to the development of cancer			2
' tests confirmed she was suffering from basal cell carcinoma , a type of skin cancer			1
image on the left shows the scar left on @entity8 's neck after the skin cancer was removed since discovering the skin cancer in the summer of 2007 , mrs @entity8 has battled breast cancer which required a full mastectomy on her left side in the spring of 2011 , and bouts of chemotherapy and radiotherapy between 2012 and 2013			1
she is currently in remission and is being supported in her recovery by her partner @entity130 , 43 , and @entity9			2
the skin cancer , which doctors have told her was unrelated to the development of breast cancer , has not reoccured			1
she said the skin cancer shock , and her following struggle with breast cancer , has prompted a change of habits and a refreshed outlook on life			1
she said : ' i do n’t tend to go on holiday to places where it ’s hot and , if i do , i do n’t go on the sunbed beforehand and make sure i do n’t go in the sun to the degree i did			0
i ’m a lot more cautious than i ever was before			0

she believes the cancer could have been caused by a heat - conducting silver chain which she wore around her neck ' i got rid of the chain that became hot - it ’s in the jewellery box now , never to be worn again , and when i do wear a lighter gold chain now , i keep it tucked in to my shirt			2
' i ’ve spoken about my experiences with cancer , and how i ’ve handled them , with other people			0
a friend of mine has the brca gene and she is soon going for a double mastectomy - it ’s a relief for her to be able to talk to me , because i ’ve been through it			0
“ the most frequent questions are - ‘ what happens next ? if i need a breast reconstruction , what will i look like after the surgery ? ’ i ’m happy to show people my reconstruction , which is encouraging for them			0
“ people ask me how i ’ve managed to stay so strong			0
experiencing cancer puts things in perspective - if you ’re diagnosed you ca n’t get worked up about little things , like breaking a nail			2
' it feels nice to be able to share that perspective with people			0
