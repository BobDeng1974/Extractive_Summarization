@entity1 's coach @entity0 had predicted a tight , closely - matched contest			1
he proved a sound and decent judge			2
with matching 4 - 5 - 1 formations , @entity4 and their @entity6 league opponents embarked on a game of @entity10 chess			1
at home next week , the @entity12 team will surely find another gear			1
but there was little here to alter the accuracy of van do @entity20 ’s assessment			2
despite some strong play – particularly in the first half – @entity4 could n’t get the goal their chances merited			1
yet a scoreless first leg is no disaster			2
critically , they did n’t concede despite substitute @entity28 coming within inches of scoring three minutes from time			2
debut : @entity30 makes his first appearance for @entity4 in the @entity33 tie @entity4 : @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ; flood , @entity39 , @entity40 ( low 88 ) ; @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity30 76 ) subs : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			1
@entity1 : @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , van der @entity58 ( @entity28 82 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 66 ) , @entity61			0
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66			0
referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) @entity1 left the @entity70 the more content team			0
yet both coaches were united in their view afterwards			0
this contest will go all the way			0
home advantage pushed @entity4 to some neat attacking football			1
on nights like this , in front of a 16,523 crowd , @entity78 is a good place to be			0
@entity1 were a step up from @entity86 , the @entity84 dismissed on an 8 - 0 aggregate			2
yet in a strong opening half hour the @entity4 did enough here to merit a narrow advantage for the second game			1
it had seemed @entity40 might make the difference			0
in the early stages he had right - back @entity96 in a state of alarm with his pace , the full back eventually earning a second - half booking for one foul too many			2
@entity1 ’s languid passing game was geared towards counter-attacking containment			0
but @entity4 were n’t having it			1
they harried and probed , pressed and pushed , and @entity40 did n’t look like a player willing to be constrained by anybody			0
he almost broke the stalemate in nine minutes , showing great endeavour to simply collect the ball and go past @entity111 , gaining a yard before striking a left foot shot parried outwards by keeper @entity50			0
the ball almost fell perfectly for @entity115 , seeking his 15th goal in 21 appearances , but was thumped out of play for a corner			0
qualifier : players emerge from the tunnel for the opening round @entity124 match @entity40 ’s direct play posed the visitors more problems in 24 minutes when he collected a pass from @entity41 and took a superb first touch , holding the ball long enough for the @entity131 to advance into the area			0
@entity41 tried to dink the return pass over @entity134 , but the keeper made himself big and saved			0
@entity4 were growing into this game , too			1
perhaps their one frustration was the need to play @entity42 at left - back			2
ostensibly a winger , his attacking instincts were bound to out eventually and – not the tallest of players – he got up to head a @entity144 cross towards goal in 26 minutes			0
yet @entity4 could take heart from the fact his opposite number @entity34 had nothing to do until four minutes from half - time			1
even then it was @entity37 who almost turned @entity96 ’s overlapping cross into his own goal			0
@entity34 got down to stop it and the @entity4 defence froze as @entity1 ’s no9 @entity59 reacted first to strike the ball from the most acute angle			1
it ran across the face of the goal and @entity4 cleared their lines			1
for the first time in ages you could hear the @entity6 contingent of 600 fans			0
pot shot : @entity4 's @entity115 ( right ) closes down @entity53 when @entity4 ’s notoriously quiet home support – out in fine numbers – are making all the racket it ’s a sign a game is going well			1
yet the problem remained at half - time of how to take an advantage to @entity177 next week , however narrow			2
all whilst resisting a damaging away goal on the counter			0
@entity1 provoked another roar from their support in 62 minutes , @entity55 ’s rasping low drive forcing @entity34 to dive full length to his right and turn away			0
in @entity40 and @entity42 , @entity4 had the game ’s most dangerous attackers on the left side			1
in the centre , @entity43 was having a less effective night			0
@entity190 made the big call of removing his hat - trick hero from the last round and throwing on @entity30 for the last 20 minutes			1
but the former @entity195 striker had little to feed off - and @entity1 subs @entity60 and @entity197 almost combined to turn the ball past @entity34 with moments to go			2
for @entity4 that would have been harsh			1
at half - time , this tie is finely poised			1
close quarters : @entity4 's @entity40 ( right ) closes down @entity203			1

neither side could find a breakthrough in first - leg @entity33 tie
