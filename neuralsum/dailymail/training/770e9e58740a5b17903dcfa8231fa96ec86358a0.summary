@entity0 was a joy to watch but his @entity3 @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 does it make any sense for @entity9 to stay at @entity10 ? it might just be dawning on him now , that while saturday ’s victory was a special day , it ’s almost literally nothing compared to this coming saturday night in @entity14			1
that ’s the stage on which @entity9 belongs			0
he ’s destined for bigger things than an @entity19 winners ’ medal , and a bigger stage than @entity10 can offer him			2
@entity21 , all mine : @entity9 gets his hands on the @entity19 after @entity10 beat @entity24 3 - 2 at @entity25 match winner : @entity9 celebrates his extra-time goal which proved decisive for @entity10 he turns 24 in december , which is the age @entity30 is right now and his @entity32 team - mate will be his inspiration			1
@entity30 ’s ability made him the star at @entity36 but living with and flourishing alongside the elite at @entity38 this season has confirmed @entity30 ’s world class talent			2
he used to be a sizeable carp in a tiny pond at @entity36 ; @entity30 is now a killer whale in the @entity38 ocean			0
it ’s time for @entity9 to move on too , and if @entity47 get serious with their interest , it ’s a no - brainer			0
and not just because he should be playing for a stellar club who take the @entity51 seriously			2
he ’s served his time at @entity10			0
he suffered a career - threatening injury but came back to be the best player in the team			1
and the truth is @entity10 fans do n’t deserve him			2
high - flyer : @entity30 will line up for @entity38 in the @entity51 final with @entity60 on saturday jumping for joy : @entity30 has looked right at home since joining @entity38 as the world 's most expensive footballer @entity9 had to live with vile abuse from a few @entity66 , and criticism from a lot of them , when his form was n’t good			1
the abuse was so bad @entity71 considered leaving him out of games at the @entity73 , something the @entity10 manager reflected openly on as @entity9 hit top form earlier this season			1
@entity9 needed encouragement and patience from supporters at a time when he was coming back from that leg break			0
instead he was booed , told he was n’t good enough for the team , did n’t deserve a new contract and there was even a death threat aimed at him from one @entity10 fan			0
most of those fans will admit they were wrong , or at least applaud the player for turning his form around			0
but when a player receives a bad leg break coupled with abuse from his own fans , he wo n’t forget in a hurry			0
@entity97 wizard : @entity9 has enjoyed an exceptional season , finding top form for club and country , and crowned it with saturday 's @entity19 triumph rewarded : @entity71 will sign a new contract with @entity10 after delivering their first trophy in nine years @entity9 owes the @entity10 fans absolutely nothing			1
and while some may think he owes @entity71 for all the support the @entity110 boss gave him during the bad times , they should think again			0
@entity9 should , but will never be considered the star of this @entity10 line up			2
go back to @entity10 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity115 ’ @entity116 at @entity117 earlier this season			1
despite his brilliant form @entity9 was shifted out wide in that game to accommodate @entity120			1
the £ 42.5m @entity122 midfielder will always be given star billing , otherwise @entity71 risks fuelling the critics ’ belief that he ca n’t handle signing expensive players			0
out of sorts : @entity9 misfired and @entity10 lost when @entity71 shifted him out side to accommodate @entity120 at @entity117 i thought @entity9 was world class against @entity24 in the cup final , but i could n’t help feeling that when @entity134 were trumpeting their @entity51 final coverage from @entity14 this coming saturday , the @entity10 midfielder belonged on that stage , rather than doing what @entity137 did for @entity139 last season			1
if there are @entity10 fans reading this asking , “ why would he want to leave the @entity73 ? ” , they can only squirm when they realise they sound just like the @entity36 fans who asked the same question of @entity30 this time last year			1
let ’s face facts here : if @entity9 was @entity149 he ’d be going to the @entity150 this summer			0
there is nothing he can do about that			0
but he can do something about which club he plays for , so why would he stay at @entity10 if he can go and achieve true greatness elsewhere ? and all those @entity10 fans who were laying into him as he was making his way back form injury , have no right to grudge him what he truly deserves .			1

@entity9 is destined for bigger club than @entity10
@entity32 star should be playing with *compatriot* @entity30 in @entity51 final
@entity10 fans booed him when he returned from career - threatening injury
@entity71 moved him at @entity117 to accommodate @entity120
@entity9 has proved them all wrong with stellar form this season
