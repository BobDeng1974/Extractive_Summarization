by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 18 october 2013 there were fears that an eagerly anticipated comet thought to be 15 times brighter than the moon had broken up , leaving skywatchers who had hoped to spot it from @entity7 disappointed			1
but a new @entity9 photo has confirmed that the fragile icy ball appears to be intact and is on track to visit our inner solar system from november to january			1
it is hoped that @entity15 , which is making a precarious path around the sun , will put on a spectacular show for people who live in the @entity20			2
a colour composite image of @entity15 confirms the eagerly - anticipated icy ball 's nucleus is still intact			1
it was taken by @entity25 's @entity9 on october 9 when the comet was inside @entity28 ' orbit and about 177 million miles from @entity7			1
the comet 's coma appears a greenish - blue colour due to gas			0
the tail forms as dust particles are pushed away from the nucleus by the pressure of sunlight the eagerly anticipated comet could be 15 times brighter than the moon , with a massive tail , making it visible even in broad daylight			1
a new image of the sun - bound @entity43 shows that it is still in one piece , despite fears from experts that its icy nucleus might disintegrate as the sun warms it			1
some astronomers had predicted that @entity15 could break apart before november 28 when it is predicted to travel just 730,000 miles from the surface of the sun. in july , experts had claimed that @entity15 was fizzling out and astronomer @entity55 , of the @entity56 in @entity57 , said : ' the future of comet @entity15 does not look bright , but @entity25 's @entity9 has taken the image that will make sky watchers hopeful for a sighting of a lifetime , as @entity15 has been decribed as the ' comet of the century '			1
in july , the @entity15 was pictured on the opposite side of the @entity65 at around 378 million miles away from @entity7 , travelling at over 50,000 miles per hour while the image , taken on october 9 , can not pick out the comet 's solid nucleus , astronomers said the telescope would most likely have discovered evidence of fragments if the comet had disintegrated			1
experts from the @entity75 in @entity76 , which operates the telescope , also said the ' head ' surrounding the nucleus is ' symmetric and smooth '			0
' this would probably not be the case if clusters of smaller fragments were flying along			0
what 's more , a polar jet of dust first seen in @entity9 images taken in april is no longer visible and may have turned off , ' they wrote in a statement			2
the most recent image from the @entity9 was taken within the orbit of @entity28 , around 177 million miles from @entity7 , they said			1
the comet will pass closest to the sun on november 28 and is predicted to make its closest approach to @entity7 on december 26 at a distance of 39.9 million miles			1
there is still a chance the comet will not survive its journey close to the sun , but if it does , @entity101 could learn a lot about the comet 's composition by observing which gases boil off it as it nears the sun. it could reach temperatures of about 4,900 degrees @entity111 ( 2,700 degrees @entity112 ) which is hot enough to melt lead and runs the risk of being pulled apart by the sun 's gravity			2
@entity15 is roughly heading towards the centre of our @entity118			0
it will pass within one million miles of the @entity65 's surface on 28th november			0
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity15 was over 584 million miles from the @entity65 some scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to weather the sun 's heat			1
other researchers are also hopeful that we will be able to see the comet from @entity7 if it has standard density and spin charcteristics			0
according to @entity134 , sky watchers have organised a global @entity15 observation campaign so that a number of @entity7 - based telescopes can keep an eye on the comet 's progress			1
images of @entity15 obtained using the @entity142 at @entity143 on february 4 , march 4 , april 3 , and may 4 , 2013 ( left to right , respectively ) if comet @entity15 survives the encounter , it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet passes back through the inner solar system			0
the comet , named @entity15 after the @entity150 that made its discovery , was found in september 2012 by two amateur @entity153 astronomers			2
scientists believe the comet hails from the @entity156 , a cluster of icy rocks that circle the sun about 50,000 times farther away than @entity7 's orbit			2
spotted in space : two astronomers from @entity153 discovered the icy ball , pictured here dimly lit against background stars @entity15 is roughly heading towards the centre of our @entity118			2
it will pass within one million miles of the @entity65 ’s surface on 28th november			0
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity15 was over 584 million miles from the @entity171 its average speed throughout july was 55,405mph			0
it will continue to accelerate steadily until november when it will whip around our @entity65 at an astonishing 425,000mph			0
early data analysis suggests @entity15 ’s size to be around three miles in diameter			0
if @entity15 does n’t fizzle out , you can expect to see the comet without specilaist equipment anywhere between the middle of november until the middle of january 2014 .			0

there were fears that @entity15 , which promised to be visible from @entity7 in broad daylight later this year , had fizzled out
but an image from the @entity9 has confirmed the nucleus of the comet is intact and the icy body is on course
astronomers are optimistic the comet will survive its *transit* 730,000 miles from the sun , as its nucleus is estimated to measure up to 1.2 miles across
