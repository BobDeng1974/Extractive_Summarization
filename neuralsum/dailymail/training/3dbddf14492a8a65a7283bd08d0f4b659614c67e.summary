bum - bags , jelly shoes and thick glasses			0
there have been some surprising style revivals over the past few years and yet one trend remains baffling and that 's the penchant for socks and sandals			1
for years they have been judged the lowest of the low when it comes to style mistakes and were recently voted the number one summer style faux pas in a poll by @entity14			0
however , thanks to certain sandal - and - sock - sporting celebrities ( we mean you , @entity20 , and you @entity21 ) , the trend is slowly trickling into the mainstream @entity21 was spotted on the streets of @entity24 in a pair of sturdy sandals and grey socks this week @entity21 was spotted this week wearing a pair of sensible suede sandals paired with rather woolly grey socks as he spent quality time with his daughter @entity33			1
and even celebrities without the dad status to defend their sock and sandal combo are happily jumping aboard the trend			1
@entity20 is a repeat offender , seen rocking the trend on more than one occassion			0
@entity42 and @entity43 arrived at @entity44 , @entity45 in march this year in matching sandal and sock combos			0
repeat offender : @entity20 has been seen stepping out in the controversial trend on more than one occassion @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 have all championed the style			1
and where celebrities lead , the rest of us follow - at least if new sales figures from a major department store are to be believed			2
high street retailer @entity61 , has seen a 68 per cent increase in sales of socks and sandals - though quite how they know they are being worn together is unclear - while purchases of bright short - sleeved shirts have soared by 72 per cent , completing the sad - dad ensemble			1
two of a kind : @entity70 took the trend one step further when they wore matching sandals and socks at @entity45 's @entity44 in march grungy : the famously trendy @entity75 stepped out in the trend at this year 's @entity77 ( left ) , and @entity78 does a sloppy take on the look ( right ) this trend could simply be explained by the issue of comfort says personal stylist , @entity84 of @entity61			1
' we did n’t see it coming , but perhaps we should have done as let ’s be honest there are fewer things more comfy than a solid well - made sandal and a soft pair of socks to stop them rubbing on bare skin			2
' as for the shirts , who can resist a smile when someone walks past in a garishly bright short - sleeved top			0
it brightens up the day and reminds people of holidays and beach - side fun , even if they are stuck at home '			0
@entity84 added that female celebrities have helped to transform the fashion faux - pas into a true style staple			0
' teaming socks and sandals together provides comfort and style but the girls have taken this trend to the next level			1
' @entity115 socks with metallic sandals and printed socks with neutral sandals reflect the autumn winter 14 catwalk style as seen in runway shows such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 '			2
@entity123 ' ready to wear autumn / winter 2014 collection featured the infamous sandal and sock combo			0

celebs like @entity21 and the @entity136 sisters have championed the trend
@entity61 has seen a 68 per cent increase on socks and sandals sales
