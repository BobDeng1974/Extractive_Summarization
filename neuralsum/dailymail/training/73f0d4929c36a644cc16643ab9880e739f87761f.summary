still those pesky @entity0 can not be beaten			0
@entity2 did almost everything right but came off second - best yet again against an under - strength home side in what became a thrilling finish at the @entity6			2
this was a golden chance wasted for @entity2 who , thanks to a sublime 141 from @entity10 , had @entity12 down and almost out only to endure a miserable last 10 overs with the bat and then just fail to defend a still decent 303 for eight			1
at the centre of @entity12 ’s third successive win in this tri-series was @entity18 , surely the most improved player in world cricket and now the match - winner in his first game as captain against @entity2			1
@entity18 's century formed the backbone of @entity12 's innings as they overcame @entity2 @entity18 celebrates reaching three figures for @entity12 in the game against @entity2 in @entity29 when @entity18 , leading @entity12 in the absence of the suspended @entity32 , was joined by @entity2 ’s old bete noire in @entity34 , his side still needed 88 from 76 balls and the game was in the balance			1
yet the pair took their side to the brink and , even after @entity42 snared @entity34 and induced a late wobble , @entity12 sneaked home with a ball in hand to leave @entity2 needing to beat @entity47 again in @entity48 next friday to make sure of their place in the final of this @entity53 tournament			1
‘ i have n’t seen @entity12 produce death bowling like that for a very long time , ’ said @entity2 captain @entity54			1
‘ they made things very difficult for us			2
we were dominant for the first 40 overs and looked set for a commanding total , probably 340 , but we did n’t manage to get there			0
’ @entity54 himself was out first ball , but he insisted that the bizarre case of a failed blackmail plot in the build - up did not distract him			0
‘ it has n’t been distracting at all , ’ he said			0
‘ i spoke to the @entity70 and i was very happy for them to deal with it			0
they just told me to focus on my cricket 100 per cent and i ’ve done that			0
it was n’t easy when i came in			0
the ball was reverse swinging			0
’ @entity12 's victory was secured in the final over of the tri-series match @entity10 hit a century against @entity12 to move past @entity85 's previous record of 5,092 runs this , though , was a magnificent effort from @entity10			1
it was all very well hitting 187 in a warm - up match , but this was the real deal , a big hundred against @entity12 and easily the best and the quickest of his four one - day international centuries ahead of the @entity95			1
in the process @entity10 passed 5,000 one - day runs and overtook @entity85 as @entity2 ’s leading runscorer in the format but the fact that 10 players worldwide have scored more than 10,000 tells you all you need to know about @entity2 ’s under - achievement			1
here , @entity10 even outscored the designated hitter in @entity105 — at least until @entity105 smacked three sixes in successive balls from @entity108 — in a stand of 113 in fewer than 18 overs that bodes well for the @entity95 battles ahead			2
‘ @entity112 has been awesome , ’ said @entity54			0
‘ since we touched down he ’s really shown his experience and class			0
he ’s led from the front in training and it ’s really paid off			0
it ’s a privilege to have someone like him in the squad			0
’ @entity120 - born @entity10 is only the second @entity121 to surpass 5,000 odi runs for his country it should have provided the launch pad for an impregnable total but judged by the very highest standards @entity2 will be disappointed that they could not score at least 30 more			1
when they were poised at 175 for two after 30 overs — and even when they stood at 244 for two after 40 — @entity2 looked set for 350 but they had a miserable final 10 overs when the platform was built for their hitters			2
@entity133 proved the perfect foil for @entity10 in a stand of 121 from 19 overs but a middle order packed with dynamism stalled and spluttered			2
yes , @entity12 ’s bowling at the death , mainly from @entity141 , proved mightily effective but @entity2 should have managed more than 59 off the last 10 overs for the loss of six wickets , three falling off the last three balls			1
@entity133 assisted @entity10 's innings with 69 coming from 100 deliveries but @entity2 could not defend their total @entity149 should ask himself how he could score only seven off 16 balls while @entity151 was not much better with 25 from 24 balls			1
it felt as if @entity2 had fallen short but when @entity154 found early reverse swing and took two wickets in three balls they were favourites for an important victory			2
but while @entity18 , a run machine in the test series against @entity47 , was still there @entity2 could not rest easy and even when @entity12 lost their finisher @entity162 they were still able to pace their chase almost perfectly			1
@entity18 finished unbeaten on 102 , with @entity141 scurrying the winning run off his first ball , and @entity2 were left wondering what might have been			1
‘ it ’s frustrating but it ’s still early in the trip and we ’re making strides , ’ said @entity54			0
‘ today was a learning curve for us			0
’ @entity12 ’s psychological hold continues ahead of their @entity95 opener against @entity2 in @entity174 on february 14			2

@entity2 had posted 303 in their innings and @entity10 made 141
@entity10 overtook @entity85 to become leading one - day run scorer
but @entity12 captain @entity18 's century guided @entity12 to victory
