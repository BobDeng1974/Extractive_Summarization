by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 for those who expected @entity4 to blow into @entity6 football like a whirlwind , the man they call the @entity2 made a surprisingly quiet start to life as @entity11 ’s new manager			1
there was no rousing speech to his players at the club ’s @entity15 yesterday , no laying down of the law , just polite introductions at lunchtime and a watching brief over his first training session on wednesday night			2
new beginning : new @entity11 manager @entity4 meets @entity23 and @entity24 time to work : the trio have a big job on their hands if they are going to make @entity11 competitive again fifty - eight days after he was officially confirmed as manager in may , @entity31 finally touched down in @entity33 at 11.50am aboard a private jet charged with putting @entity11 back on their perch , to use sir @entity37 ’s terminology			1
that the 62 - year - old turned up for work just three days after returning from the @entity40 in @entity41 with @entity42 says everything about his determination to drag @entity11 from the mire of the @entity47 era			1
some might question his choice of attire — a blue suit and sky blue and white striped tie — given the contrasting fortunes at neighbours @entity55 , but this is not a manager who cares about conforming			2
half an hour after he was driven from the airport in a club car , @entity31 arrived at @entity15 for the first time to be met by no 2 @entity23 and club executive vice-chairman @entity24			1
he was shown to his office and then given a tour of the complex by @entity23 , who has been running things in @entity31 ’s absence along with @entity68 coaches @entity66 and @entity69			1
walk this way : @entity23 gave @entity31 a guided tour of @entity11 's @entity15 training complex write caption here they will update @entity31 on every member of his squad before @entity11 leave for their pre-season tour of @entity78 at lunchtime on friday			1
@entity31 joined the players at 1pm in the @entity15 dining room where chicken and duck were on the menu			2
the manager introduced himself to each one individually and spoke with them for a couple of minutes before sitting at a separate table with his @entity68 backroom team and @entity23			1
the squad had already trained in the morning and been told to report for a second workout at 5.30pm — their fourth double session in 10 days since returning for pre-season work			1
incoming : @entity94 and @entity96 midfielder @entity95 has been linked with a transfer to @entity11 good omen : @entity31 has had a successful summer with @entity42 at the @entity100 @entity31 had been expected to speak to them and outline his vision for the club , but instead he stood back and observed while @entity69 and @entity66 took the session			1
it is understood that @entity31 will wait until more of the club ’s @entity40 contingent , including @entity109 internationals @entity108 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , join up with the squad on friday before addressing the players			1
they have been given thursday off to spend with their families while @entity31 faces his first official news conference at @entity119 at 3pm			1
despite the softly - softly start , one thing is clear — @entity31 ’s word will be law			2
‘ he ’s got his own management style which has thrown up a few difficulties along the way wherever he ’s been because of the way that he is , the way he puts himself in front of players , ’ said fellow @entity68 and former @entity11 first - team coach @entity123 on wednesday			1
‘ players accept it or players sometimes do n’t			2
if they do n’t accept it then , yeah , you probably have a problem			0
’ @entity31 ’s arrival in @entity33 coincided with an announcement that @entity11 have tied up a long - term sponsorship deal with a @entity140 noodle company			1
even for a coach whose vast experience takes in @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , the next chapter of his distinguished career promises to be something else altogether			0
a fortnight before the @entity40 , @entity31 took the stage in his native @entity42 , addressing an audience of business experts to outline his leadership vision			1
@entity31 on arrogance : the national coach sees opportunities because he believes in vision and structure			0
when i say that , i mean my vision and my structure			0
yes , that is arrogant			0
i bet you hear that people find me arrogant			0
it does not bother me			0
i am not arrogant but i do believe in my vision , so the people who work in my organisation have something to hold on to			2
that is what i believe @entity171 on preparation : i see chances because i believe in preparation			0
that is half the job			0
my mum used to say that and she only went to primary school			0
you do n’t think i would be standing here without preparing ? training			0
you recruit people and do you train them to create the best product ? @entity184 on backroom staff : i ca n’t do it on my own because i do n’t know everything , do i ? i know you start laughing because i am portrayed that i do know everything			0
i listen to the specialists			0
when i became national coach , the whole world thought i was going to pick the players to get us to the @entity40			1
no ! first the staff ! we have to surround players with @entity195 on being the boss : vision is not just about the game			2
my vision also stands for my vision on each person , on society , on the way i speak			0
my tone of voice — if i leave gaps between my sentences there is always a reason			0
it always comes back to my football team			0
@entity31 on the @entity213 model : when i saw the @entity42 squad for the first time , i showed them @entity143 , who play with the triangle midfield with the point directing to the defence — one controlling midfielder			2
but i also showed the players the @entity213 team			2
otherwise they would say : ‘ yes boss , but how can we adapt when we only meet up eight times a season ? ’ the boys knew from day one what the vision of @entity31 stood for			0
reward : @entity230 has been given an extended break after his @entity40 heroics for @entity42			1
