by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 8 july 2013 he 's only two weeks old , but fluffy @entity3 the kitten may already have used up his nine lives after clinging on to the bottom of a lorry for almost 170 miles			1
the stowaway was found underneath a container hgv when it parked up at a factory that makes made - to - measure blinds by the factory owner @entity11			1
now he ’s set for a happy home life with her once he ’s had some @entity14 at a local animal rescue centre			1
adorable : @entity3 the kitten was found under a lorry after travelling 170 miles dark eyes : the kitten was named @entity3 after the origin of his journey , @entity24 staff there are convinced his mother may have put him in a metal box on the lorry ’s chassis out of harm ’s way while she went off hunting around the docks in @entity24 , @entity34			1
but while her back was turned the 40 foot long lorry was loaded with a container and driven off to its destination in @entity39			1
the delivery arrived at @entity41 in @entity42 last wednesday , but it was only when the driver switched off the engine that staff heard the little cries of the terrified creature			2
@entity11 , 48 , said : ' we could hear him , but we could n’t see where he was			2
we tried to coax him out with some food , but we were wasting our time as he was too young to have been weaned			2
' one of the lads managed to reach up inside the metal box and got hold of him and pulled him out			2
' he was shaking and covered in oil			0
he looked like a rat			0
saved : factory owner @entity11 found little @entity3 under the @entity57 feeding time : he is being cared for by @entity59 in @entity60 but is likely to be going home with @entity11 ' we got some formula milk and fed him with a syringe that we had in the first aid box			1
then we rang round some local rescue centres to see who could look after him			0
@entity11 took him to the @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity60 and staff there quickly gave him a name			0
owner @entity73 said : “ it was a straightforward choice really , he was @entity3 who ’d stowed away from the docks … @entity77 ! ' @entity3 is also @entity78 for lucky , so that was quite apt too ! ' there ’s a lot of feral cats around the port and it seems that @entity3 ’s mum must have popped him in the box under the lorry to keep him safe and dry while she went off hunting			1
obviously when she came back he ’d gone			0
curious : as he was located on the outside of the container @entity3 is thought to be a @entity93 cat unfortunate : @entity11 said that she thinks people need to have their animals neutered to avoid the problem of strays ' if he ’d been inside the container we would have had to put him in quarantine , but because he was on the lorry , well almost , everyone is satisfied he ’s an @entity104 ! ' he ’s settled in well and he ’s feeding well and putting on weight so he ’ll be able to leave in a few weeks			1
after what he ’s been through he ’s a little miracle			0
' he ’s got plenty of company here , there ’s so many strays around at the moment			0
people need to have their animals neutered to avoid this problem , they can get financial help if they are struggling			0
' @entity3 was cute that despite her head telling her she should n’t have another cat animal loving @entity11 has decided she will give him a home alongside her other moggy nine - year - old @entity122			1
' i kept think i should n’t , but he was so cute and he went through so much to find me , ' she said			0
' obviously it was meant to be , you ca n’t fight fate			0

the two - week - old kitten survived a 170 - mile journey under a lorry
he travelled from @entity24 , @entity34 to a factory in @entity39
factory owner @entity135 named him @entity3 after his place of origin
