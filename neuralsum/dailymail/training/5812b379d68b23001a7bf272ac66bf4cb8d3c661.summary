after a miserable @entity12 campaign , which saw them bow out in the group phase , the hosts failed to bounce back as stunning volley from @entity16 early in the second half decided the match			0
even without @entity1 the likes of @entity20 and @entity21 - who was the provider of their most encouraging moments - lined up for @entity0 in the @entity25 , but could n't muster a response			2
@entity21 , on loan at @entity28 from @entity29 , whipped in a number of dangerous crosses and fired wide from inside the area as his side took the ascendancy without converting			0
elated : @entity6 players celebrate their upset win over @entity0 in their @entity8 qualifier shock : @entity6 forward @entity16 ( centre ) celebrates giving his nation the lead over @entity0 in @entity43 on the turn : @entity16 scored a cracking volley that came in from behind his body to win the match star - studded : @entity20 ( right ) was among a host of big names in action for @entity0 , including @entity21 and @entity52 , despite the absence of their superstar @entity1 devastated : @entity0 players react to the upset defeat in @entity43 @entity0 0 - 1 @entity6 @entity59 0 - 7 @entity58 @entity60 1 - 3 @entity61 @entity63 0 - 1 @entity62 @entity65 2 - 1 @entity64 @entity67 1 - 2 @entity66 @entity69 2 - 1 @entity68 @entity71 1 - 2 @entity70 the home fans were silenced by a moment of magic seven minutes into the second half when @entity76 's cross from the right came in behind @entity16 , who impressively rifled a right - footed volley on the turn into the bottom corner from 15 yards			1
@entity81 hit the post , @entity21 headed over from close range and @entity20 had a shot fumbled by @entity85 , who also tipped over a shot from @entity87 , as @entity0 chased the game and @entity6 held on			0
perhaps an even greater shock was averted when @entity61 went 1 - 0 down to the @entity60 when @entity90 found the back of the net just before half - time in their @entity94 meeting			1
@entity96 striker @entity95 came to the rescue though , first to equalise and then secure the lead before @entity99 put the result beyond doubt late on			0
