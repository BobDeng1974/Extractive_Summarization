from iphones to the latest @entity2 , most people find it difficult to accurately recall what the ' most recognizable ' brand 's logo looks like when tested , according to a new study			1
the reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them , researchers from the @entity10 , @entity8 found			1
when asked to draw the @entity2 logo , only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly in terms of shape , bite size and leaf shape and orientation			1
however , less than half of participants were able to identify it from a set of 12 similar @entity2 logos with altered features , according to the study which was published last month			1
less than half of participants were able to identify the logo correctly from a set of 12 similar @entity2 logos with altered features ( to find out which is the correct logo , scroll down to the bottom of this article ) during the first stage of the selection quiz , the participant is asked how confident they are from a rating of one to five ; one being the most confident and five the least confident			1
most people who participated felt the @entity2 logo was highly memorable before attempting to recall the details of the logo , according to researchers			1
the second part is actually spotting the logo out of a set of 12 apples which are separated into three columns of four			0
when asked to draw the @entity2 logo , only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly ( pictured above ) in terms of shape , bite size and leaf shape and orientation while it might initially be thought of as an easy task , when faced with all of the varying logos , it becomes increasingly difficult			1
considering the fact that people are exposed to the @entity2 logo on products from mobile phones , computers and laptops , it could be expected that good memory would hold strong when correctly recognizing the logo			1
the reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them , researchers from the @entity10 , @entity8 found			1
while people are often exposed to the logo , they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available ( above left , an @entity90 and right , the new @entity2 watch that was displayed on monday ) however , ' memory is often tuned towards remembering gist - based schematic information ' researchers said , which means details can be quickly forgotten			2
' the ubiquitous @entity2 logo is a simple design and is often referred to as one of the most recognizable logos in the world , ' wrote researchers			2
the @entity2 logo , which has had seven different versions over the years , has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977 ( above the first @entity2 logo by co-founder @entity106 in 1976 depicting sir @entity107 ) ' participants showed surprisingly poor memory for the details of the logo as measured through recall [ drawings ] and forced - choice recognition			1
' the findings provided support for theories of attentional saturation , in attentional amnesia and reconstructive memory , as well as how availability can lead to overconfidence when it comes to memory			0
the results in the study also did not differ between @entity2 and pc users			0
the @entity2 logo , which has had seven different versions over the years , has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977 , which has remained the same ever since , according to @entity129			2
while people are often exposed to the logo , they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available , said researchers			0
similarly , when it comes to other logos such as the @entity141 letters , many people have difficulty remembering the correct colors			0
researchers said this is because attention and memory are not always tuned to recalling what we consider memorable			0
' increased exposure increases familiarity and confidence , but does not reliably affect memory , ' they wrote			2
' despite frequent exposure to a simple and visually pleasing logo , attention and memory are not always tuned to remembering what we may think is memorable			0
' did you spot the correct logo ? the @entity2 logo is pictured at the bottom of the third column			2
the @entity2 logo , which has had seven different versions in total over the years , has always kept the same silhouette of an apple since it was first developed by designer @entity167 in 1977			0
the first and original logo was a woodcut by co-founder @entity106 in 1976 featuring sir @entity107 , but was later changed to the apple silhouette , which has remained the same to present day			0
the @entity2 silhouette over the years : above from top left @entity2 's logo from 1977 - 1998 ; top center 1998 ; top right 1998 - 2000 ; bottom left 2001 - 2007 ; bottom center 2007 - 2013 ; bottom right 2013 - currently			0

findings showed when asked to draw logo , only one in 85 participants could recreate it correctly
when asked to identify logo from a *group* of 12 similar @entity2 logos with altered features , less than half guessed accurately
researchers from @entity10 , @entity8 said even though people are often exposed to @entity2 logo it does not ' reliably affect memory '
