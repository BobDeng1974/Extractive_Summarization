@entity0 died after suffering a massive allergic reaction that may have been triggered by the glue in her hair extensions after a night out dancing a woman died from a massive allergic reaction that could have been caused by the glue in her hair extensions , a pathologist said yesterday			1
@entity0 , 34 , who had used hair extensions for 14 years , collapsed after clubbing until the early hours			1
@entity11 pathologist @entity10 told the inquest into her death that the latex glue used to apply her extensions – or the solvent for removing old ones – may have been to blame			1
he added : ‘ i ’ve seen cases where people using solvent to apply extensions has actually caused anaphylactic shock			2
‘ there are about ten to 20 deaths a year in this country , many more in @entity27			1
i have seen four in the last three months			2
’ dr @entity10 told the hearing at @entity29 in @entity30 : ‘ the hair extensions in @entity0 ’s hair were of a latex type			1
this may or may not be related [ to her death ]			2
if it is the hair extension , normally a reaction would occur within half an hour of applying them			1
’ but he added that traces of glue or solvent could have seeped into her bloodstream hours later after she started perspiring on the dancefloor			2
he ruled out reactions to food and alcohol and said there were no drugs in her system			2
on may 15 last year , @entity49 - born miss @entity0 had been dancing at a club where her boyfriend , @entity51 , was the dj. mr @entity51 said miss @entity0 , one of nine children , was fine until she stepped through the doorway of their home in @entity57 , south - east @entity30 , at 6.30am , then suddenly collapsed and stopped breathing			1
he called an ambulance and tried to resuscitate her as 999 operators gave him first aid instructions over the phone			0
but she never properly regained consciousness and died later in hospital			0
a post-mortem failed to find any abnormalities with her organs or substances which could have caused her death			2
her younger brother @entity70 , who attended the inquest with his wife @entity72 , said : ' this is the most frustrating thing of all			2
we still do n’t know what happened			0
' the inquest heard ms @entity0 had been drinking @entity79 brandy and @entity80 hours before she died , but only had a moderate amount of alcohol in her body which could not have caused her death			1
dr @entity10 did not find any kind of drugs or substances in her body			0
@entity29 : coroner @entity87 recorded a verdict of death by natural causes as he said it was not possible to identify a clear link with a particular allergen that caused ms @entity0 's body to go into shock @entity49 - born ms @entity0 , who had eaten takeaway jerk pork and @entity98 before going out , did not have any history of food allergies			1
dr @entity10 said an allergic reaction to food would normally occur within half an hour of consumption so he did not think it could have been anything she ate			1
he then examined a hair piece ms @entity0 wore to see if there could have been an allergic reaction to the latex glue used to attach it to her natural hair			1
but the pathologist said he would expect an allergic reaction to occur shortly after the glue was applied and @entity0 had been wearing extensions , which she got done in salons , since the age of 20			1
link ? the hair used in hair extensions may have caused the death of @entity0 after lengthy discussions with experts the pathologist said he was certain the cause of death was anaphylactic shock as the level of tryptase , which occurs naturally in the body during an allergic reaction , was 178 micrograms per litre of blood - up to 25 times higher than the normal amount of between two and 14 micrograms per litre			1
however , he said he could not pinpoint exactly what was the trigger was			0
dr @entity10 added : ' the diagnosis is correct , but i am not sure what triggered it			0
' if she had recovered we could have carried out tests , but the situation we have , tragically , we can not take it any further			0
coroner @entity87 recorded a verdict of death by natural causes as he said it was not possible to identify conclusively a link with a particular allergen that caused her to go into shock			2
he said : ' she had an allergic reaction to something as the level of tryptase in her body was 178 micrograms , but we are not able to identify what the specific agent was that that caused this reaction			1
' speaking afterwards , mr @entity51 , ms @entity0 's partner of two years with whom she had been trying to have a baby , described her as a ' wonderful person ' who helped him turn his life around			1
mr @entity51 said : ' she changed me a lot			0
it ’s so shocking this could have happened			0
i still have to keep looking at pictures of her on my phone			0
' ms @entity0 ’s brother , @entity70 , 32 , added : ' she was such a nice person			1
she was fun - loving			0
' she just enjoyed her life , enjoyed doing what made her happy			0
' i was younger than her by two years , but we were like twins			0
she even taught me how to read and write			0
' the last time i spoke to her was the friday before this happened			0
i remember her every day			0
