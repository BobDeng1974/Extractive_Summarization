more than 13million families are each losing £ 200 a year because they are on rip - off variable rate energy tariffs , it is revealed today			1
the total extra cost of these deals to families is an astonishing £ 2.7billion a year			1
some 60 per cent of customers with the @entity8 firms – @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 – are on standard variable tariffs , for which tiny price cuts have been announced in recent weeks			1
some 60 per cent of customers with the @entity8 firms – @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 – are on standard variable tariffs but industry experts say that , even after the cuts , these tariffs are £ 200 to £ 250 a year more expensive than fixed rate deals available from the @entity8 and smaller rivals			1
and the households on these tariffs tend to be those who have been with their supplier for many years – meaning they are being penalised for their loyalty			1
the details are revealed as an inquiry by the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) is this week expected to reveal a culture of exploitation by the @entity8 firms , which are accused of failing to pass on huge falls in the wholesale cost of gas and electricity in the past year			1
the £ 2.7billion rip - off has been estimated by the @entity36 , which is today launching a ' power to @entity39 ' campaign to encourage people to escape these expensive tariffs			1
more than 13million families are each losing £ 200 a year because they are on rip - off variable rate energy tariffs the campaign is being backed by @entity44 , of financial advice website @entity45 , who said people need to wake up to the ' ugly truth ' about the standard tariffs			1
' we need to shout loud about the benefits of switching tariff , ' he said			0
' too many people think energy firms are all the same			2
that 's far from true , there are huge differences on both price and customer service			0
the easiest way to switch is to use one of 13 price comparison websites accredited by the industry regulator @entity63			2
it is possible to agree to switch in as little as five clicks on these sites			0
you will need your ' annual summary ' , a document sent by energy firms to all customers , which includes key facts about your tariff , such as energy use over the previous 12 months in kilowatt - hours			1
the switching website will ask for your current supplier and tariff , annual usage , preferred payment method and postcode			2
it will then show two lists of tariffs that are cheaper , highlighting the potential annual saving			2
the first list will be for suppliers where the comparison website can begin the switch immediately			0
the second list will be for the entire industry , including firms you will need to contact directly			0
more information on how to switch is available at @entity94 or by calling the @entity95 on 0300 123 1234			0
' the worry is that news of recent price cuts , even though they were paltry , will have given many false confidence that they 're on a decent deal			0
' examine the figures and the ugly truth is very different			0
' even after price cuts , someone on a @entity8 supplier standard tariff with typical use will pay £ 1,158 a year , whereas switch to the cheapest tariff and they 'd pay just over £ 900 a year			1
' trade association @entity111 , which represents the suppliers , said : ' new , cheaper tariffs are being launched every week , meaning that customers could save hundreds of pounds on their annual bill			2
' the savings are even greater for households who have n't switched in a long time			0
' energy expert @entity121 , from comparison website @entity119 , said : ' if more of us switched from expensive standard tariffs to cheaper deals , suppliers would work harder to attract and retain customers with lower prices and better customer service			1
' the @entity28 investigation is expected to focus on the poor treatment of long - standing customers and to argue that the profits of the leading firms are far higher than they admit			1
the companies claim their profits margins are around 5 per cent of what customers pay			2
but the @entity28 is predicted to use a different measure , which could reveal ' eye - watering ' profits			0
later this week , @entity140 , which owns @entity9 , is set to report profits of nearly £ 1.6billion for 2014			0
energy secretary @entity142 said : ' the power is in people 's hands to get a better deal and save			0
millions of people can switch supplier and save hundreds of pounds today			0
