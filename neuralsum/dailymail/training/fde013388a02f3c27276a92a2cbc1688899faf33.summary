it looks like something you ’d expect to see launch from @entity4			2
but this @entity6 - style aircraft could be the future of long - haul flights			2
the hypersonic @entity9 belongs to the @entity11 military and uses a revolutionary ‘ scramjet ’ engine to reach 4,500mph within seconds			1
a trip across the @entity26 from @entity16 to @entity17 would take the plane just one hour , travelling at five times the speed of sound			1
today the cutting - edge craft will be dropped from a @entity31 bomber over the @entity32 in its latest test			1
it will be flown from @entity35 in the @entity36 in @entity37 , attached to the bomber ’s wing			2
scramjets are ' airbreathing ' aircraft because rather than carrying both fuel and the oxygen needed to provide acceleration , they carry only hydrogen fuel and ' pull ' the oxygen needed to burn it from the atmosphere			2
@entity48 is forced into the front of the engine and as hydrogen is injected into the airstream , the gases are compressed causing the temperature to rise and ignition to occur			1
this generates huge amounts of thrust and enables the jet to travel at speeds far in excess of the 1,350mph top speed of @entity63			1
the jet will then be dropped from almost 50,000ft near the @entity66 promontory			0
a rocket booster will ignite and speed it up to about @entity71 and , if all goes well , the aircraft ’s engine will take over from there , pushing the speed to more than @entity19 and lifting the craft to 70,000ft			1
the mission will last 300 seconds – the longest the craft has ever flown to date			1
after the historic test , the plane will crash into the sea , and there are no plans to recover it			0
hypersonic flight – which relates to speeds of more than five times the speed of sound – is seen as the next step for aircraft			1
‘ attaining sustained hypersonic flight is like going from propeller - driven aircraft to jet aircraft , ’ @entity87 , deputy for technology in the high speed systems division at the @entity90 in @entity91 told the @entity92			1
‘ since the @entity98 , we have examined how to make aircraft better and faster			0
hypersonic flight is one of those areas that is a potential frontier for aeronautics			0
i believe we ’re standing in the door waiting to go into that arena			0
’ the project is being funded by @entity108 and the @entity109 , which hope it can be used for military stealth aircraft and new weapons			0
the @entity9 programme is estimated to cost £ 89million , according to @entity113 , a website for military policy research			0
it has had a mixed history , with previous tests being aborted after the engine stalled			1
currently the fastest passenger plane in the world is the @entity122 , which has a top speed of 700mph or @entity124 , although it takes only seven passengers			1
in its wake is the @entity129 at 685mph and the @entity130 , which is capable of 675mph			0
the experimental craft was tested strapped to the wing of a b - 52 bomber			2
once released , it 's radical scramjet engines was fired , hopefully accelerating the craft up to @entity19 , over 2,000 metres per second the @entity9 on the wing of a @entity31			1
a previous test was the longest supersonic combustion ramjet - powered hypersonic flight to date			0
@entity141 is a measure of the ratio of the velocity of an object , in this case a plane , to the velocity of sound , which equals @entity141 1 , or 761.2 miles per hour			2
any plane that flies past the speed of sound creates a sonic boom , which often results in a major noise disturbance over close - by areas			1
before its 2003 retirement , @entity63 was long the shuttle of choice for executives eager to spend as little time as possible in the air and unafraid to shell out thousands for a 3.5 - hour transatlantic flight			0
an attempt to launch a hypersonic flight in august last year failed when the soaring heat caused the craft ’s surface to peel and the experiment ended prematurely			2
the @entity109 ’s research arm calls hypersonic flight ‘ the new stealth ’ for its promise of evading and outrunning enemy fire			0
the effort to develop hypersonic engines is necessary because they can propel vehicles at a velocity that can not be achieved from traditional turbine - powered jet engines			0
experts believe hypersonic missiles are the best way to hit a target in an hour or less			0
the only vehicle that the military currently has in its inventory with that kind of capability is the massive , nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missile			0
the scramjet engine is designed to ride on its own shockwave , and should see the test craft accelerate to about @entity19 .			1

scramjet engine can accelerate craft to over @entity19
could *dramatically* slash journey times by travelling at five times the speed of sound
