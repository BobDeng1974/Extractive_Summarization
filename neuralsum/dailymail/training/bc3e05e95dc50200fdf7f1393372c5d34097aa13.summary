embattled @entity1 boss @entity0 insists he will only walk away from @entity2 if the mounting professional crisis tips over into his family life			1
it is widely understood that only an inability to fund the seven - figure pay - off guaranteed in his contract has stayed the hands of at least some @entity1 powerbrokers eager to dispense with the manager ’s service			1

however , asked how he would react if the pressure of the situation began to affect his family , @entity0 said : ‘ completely different			1
that ’s completely different , there ’s nothing more important than my family			2
’ pressed on whether he would have a decision to make if his children , in particular , were to be affected , he conceded : ‘ one hundred per cent			0
but there is no sign of that , no. ‘ i think the older ones - i ca n’t speak for them , i can only speak to them - are sensible enough to see the bigger picture and i ’m hoping the younger ones are too young to see it			2
‘ i ’m very , very hopeful that i do n’t take it ( the pressure ) home			0
i ’m saying that , you would have to ask people at my home , but i do n’t think i take it home			0
and i think it is very , very important that i do n’t take it home			0
’ part - time @entity21 came from two goals down to beat @entity1 3 - 2 in the semi-final of the @entity59 @entity21 players celebrate wildly after equalising against @entity1 during their shock win @entity0 admitted that he had n’t spoken to anyone on the @entity1 board - including the @entity66 brothers believed to be pushing for his dismissal - since the @entity59 semi-final upset in @entity69			1
yet he insisted : ‘ i ’ve got absolutely no reason to doubt that i have their support			1
and until i hear otherwise then i could n’t comment on it			0
i ’ve got absolutely no doubt at this moment of time that i have their support because i have n’t heard otherwise			2
‘ i imagine that question has been asked following some of the comments in some of the newspapers this morning			0
‘ i have n’t read them all but nobody has told me otherwise that i do n’t have the support of the board			2
i do n’t feel the need to seek reassurance			0
‘ have i lost the confidence of the fans ? no. but you always get a reaction from poorer results			0
