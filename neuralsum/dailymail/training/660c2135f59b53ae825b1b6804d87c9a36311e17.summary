by @entity0 films like @entity2 have imagined what a fight between dinosaurs might have looked like			0
but now scientists have a better idea than ever as they have digitally reconstructed a model of a dinosaur chase using photos of footprints			1
@entity13 experts examined the prints of a predatory theropod and herbivorous sauropod , which were excavated 70 years ago , to prove that they could reconstruct and possibly @entity18 objects that no longer exist			1
this image is a photogrammetric reconstruction of the trackway of dinosaur prints			0
photo - textured ( top ) and height mapped ( bottom ) views of a section of the trackway were created from old photographs the tracks were left by two dinosaurs running through the mud of an ancient river bed more than 100 million years ago in what is now @entity41 , @entity42			1
they are some of the most famous in the world , but amazingly after part of the @entity47 trackway was removed by experts decades ago , the precious prints were sawn up into three blocks and were moved to different locations to be studied and on the way one of them was lost			0
in a bid to reconstruct the unique site , a team of specialists led by @entity57 of the @entity58 , @entity59 , pieced together 17 photographs taken by @entity62 palaeontologist @entity61 , who first discovered and excavated the site in 1940			1
the @entity47 tracks contain footprints made by a carnivorous predator called a theropod and a large herbivorous sauropod			1
dr @entity57 told @entity69 that the dinosaurs that made the print might be an @entity72 and the sauropod was likely similar to @entity74 or @entity74			2
‘ in some places the theropod tracks are in the sauropod tracks , ’ dr @entity57 told the @entity75			2
‘ [ this means ] the theropod came after			0
so @entity61 interpreted this as a theropod chasing a sauropod			1
’ the dinosaur prints are some of the most famous in the world , but one part of the trackway was lost			0
in a bid to reconstruct the unique site , a team of specialists pieced together 17 photographs ( 16 are pictured ) taken by @entity62 palaeontologist @entity61 , who first discovered and excavated the site in 1940 to digitally reconstruct the site as it was before the excavation began , the scientists scanned 17 photos using a technique called photogrammetry before combining them to develop a model of the trackway			1
they then compared the model to maps drawn by mr @entity61 , before the site was divided into blocks and carried off , the study published in the @entity104 journal explained			2
despite the variation between the photos and the hand drawn maps , scientists were able to reconstruct and view the entire 147ft ( 45metre ) long ‘ chase scene ’ in @entity18 for the first time since excavation			1
while the method is not new , the team has proved that it can be adapted for palaeontologists trying to piece together the past			0
dr @entity57 hopes that the study will help other experts digitally recreate paleontological , geological or archaeological specimens that have been lost or deteriorated over time , but for which old photographic documentation exists			0
he said : ‘ in recent years technology has advanced to the point where highly accurate 3d models can be produced easily and at very little cost just from digital photos and this has been revolutionising many different fields			1
‘ that we can apply that technology to specimens , or even entire sites , that no longer exist but were recorded photographically is extremely exciting			0
’ the @entity47 tracks contain footprints made by a carnivorous predator called a theropod and a large herbivorous sauropod			1
in some places the theropod - which was perhaps a @entity72 ( pictured ) - tracks are in the sauropod tracks , which suggests there was a chase the tracks were left by two dinosaurs running through the mud of an ancient river bed in what is now @entity41 , @entity42 , more than 100million years ago the two remaining pieces of the removed trackway are housed in the @entity152 and the @entity153			1
dr @entity57 began his research to document the prints in 2008 and as well as filling in the gap from the lost piece of excavated trackway , he wanted to record unexcavated tracks too			0
' when we first set out to map the @entity47 track , creating an accurate 3d model of the site required use of a large , heavy laser scanner that cost tens of thousands of pounds and was prone to failure especially in the extreme heat in @entity42			1
‘ however , in recent years the technology of photogrammetry has significantly improved to the point where we were , for the first time , able to use this free software to get results just as - if not more - accurate than from use of a laser scanner			2
palaeontologists can now apply the scanning technology to specimens , or even entire sites , that no longer exist but were recorded photographically , such as the footprints of the sauropod , which was likely similar to @entity74 or @entity74 ( pictured ) ‘ not only does this work with modern digital photographs but because the technology has become so advanced , and desktop computers so powerful , we were also able to use the historic photographs taken by @entity188			2
’ he said the technique will significantly increase the protection of sites and artefacts of paleontological importance			0
‘ it is only natural that specimens will be lost or deteriorate over time , particularly those such as fossil trackways that must remain in the field			0
‘ but this technology has opened up an avenue for recreating these important sites and artefacts at little cost			0
all you now need are multiple photographs taken from different angles to be able to create accurate 3d models			2

scientists have digitally reconstructed a model of the chase *based* on old photos that were taken at the moment the site was first discovered
footprints were made by a predatory theropod chasing a large herbivorous sauropod 100million years again in an area that is now in @entity42
scientists used a technique called photogrammetry to create a 3d model of the site from 17 photographs
