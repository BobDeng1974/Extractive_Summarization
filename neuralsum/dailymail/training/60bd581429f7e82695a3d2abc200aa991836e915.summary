by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was unable to complete @entity4 's first training session in @entity5 after feeling tightness in his groin during the @entity4 ' work - out at the @entity10 military base			1
the @entity12 skipper took part in some sprints and low intensity drills under the shadow of @entity18 mountain before deciding to end his session prematurely			0
@entity2 , who played the first half of @entity4 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity22 on saturday , admitted to a groin issue after the game with the @entity26 side			1
problem : @entity2 could n't complete @entity4 's first training session in @entity5 because of a tight groin warming up : @entity2 ( left ) controls the ball during a training exercise with @entity31 ( right ) on the run : @entity2 tests out his groin during a sprint with a member of @entity4 's coaching staff he said : ' i had a tight groin in midweek so it was always the plan for me to play just 45 minutes			2
' @entity2 's injury is not believed to be serious but it will still be a concern for @entity41 with @entity4 's opening @entity44 game against @entity45 now only five days away			1
the 34 - year - old , who will captain his country in @entity5 , is certain to start in the heart of @entity4 's midfield against @entity51 's side if fit			2
@entity54 star @entity53 also left training early but there has been no suggestion that the midfielder is suffering with an injury ahead of this weekend 's @entity61 showdown			0
@entity62 caused some concern when he took a breather on the turf , although he only required a plaster for a blister			0
@entity41 was buoyed by the return of @entity69 , who took part in a series of running drills with head physio @entity73 less than a week after injuring his knee in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity76 in @entity77			0

@entity2 felt tightness in his groin before @entity4 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity22
the midfielder began training on *monday* but did not finish @entity41 's session in @entity81
it is not thought that @entity2 's injury will rule him out of the @entity4 ' @entity44 opener with @entity45 in @entity103
the 34 - year - old will captain his country in @entity5
