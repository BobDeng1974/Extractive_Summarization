by @entity0 @entity1 is under pressure to deliver the ‘ speech of his life ’ tomorrow as new opinion polls reveal that his independence campaign is faltering			1
the first minister is in @entity9 for the @entity11 ’s final conference before september ’s referendum , where supporters will be bitterly disappointed that movement towards a @entity16 vote has stalled			1
a @entity18 poll has handed the @entity19 campaign a comfortable ten - point lead , with backing for independence down two points since last month to just 37 per cent			1
pressure : first minister @entity1 , pictured at the @entity11 conference today , has seen mounting criticism of his plans for independence , amid fears of a run on the banks support for a no vote held steady on 47 per cent , with the findings suggesting that growing numbers of women are opposed to leaving the @entity36			1
a separate study for @entity38 , which is the @entity11 ’s favourite pollster as it consistently shows strong backing for separation , puts the @entity16 vote on 40 per cent – down one point since a poll published at the weekend			1
the no vote slipped by one point to 45 per cent			2
@entity38 also found that even if @entity46 accept @entity47 claims that their family would be better off – which most studies show is improbable – only slightly over half of adults would vote @entity16			1
ahead of mr @entity1 ’s keynote speech tomorrow , his deputy @entity53 used the conference platform today to make a desperate appeal to labour voters to back the break - up of @entity36			1
around 800,000 traditional @entity60 voters in the central belt are thought to be key to the referendum result , and @entity63 claimed that a @entity16 vote could ‘ rejuvenate ’ her party ’s main rivals			1
her audacious appeal comes as @entity46 ’s leading elections expert , professor @entity68 of @entity69 , said the latest polling results give pro-independence campaign leaders a reason to ‘ pause for thought ’			1
‘ the no side ’s recent apparent nervousness should be steadied a little , ’ he said			0
a new poll by @entity18 gives the no campaign a 10 - point lead banks face being forced to abandon an independent @entity46 or risk losing nearly £ 300billion from @entity84 customers , figures show			1
two - fifths of clients from other parts of the @entity36 would pull their money out of @entity46 institutions if there is a @entity16 vote and no deal is struck to share the pound , according to a poll			1
currency exchange firm @entity95 , which commissioned the @entity97 survey , estimated @entity46 banks would lose £ 280billion if they did not move @entity99 after independence			1
such a loss of business would be devastating , cutting their balance sheets by more than a third			0
it is the latest economic blow to @entity1 's separation bid , which has seen finan - cial bodies queue up to raise concerns			2
business secretary @entity108 has already warned that @entity109 would abandon its @entity111 hq and move to @entity112 after separation , a move that would result in the loss of 3,200 jobs north of the @entity117			0
of 1,622 non-scots quizzed for @entity95 , 42 per cent said they would be ' more likely ' to move to an @entity84 bank , with 5 per cent saying they would be ' less likely ' and 40 per cent saying it would make no difference			0
twice as many thought they would be worse off if @entity46 voted for independence than predicted a boost - 16 per cent compared to eight , while 56 per cent thought it would make no difference			1
‘ in themselves the changes are statistically insignificant			0
however , this [ @entity18 poll ] is the second poll in a row to show that the winter ’s increase in @entity16 support may have come to a halt now that spring finally seems to be with us			2
‘ that is not the impression the @entity16 side would like to see created			2
they would prefer to see their support increase month on month – a movement with apparent sufficient momentum to take them past the winning post by september			0
they must fear that while the winter ’s gains may have been consolidated , their further progress is now stalled			0
’ professor @entity68 added : ‘ the @entity11 gather in @entity9 this weekend for their spring conference			2
activists will be hoping that mr @entity1 gives the speech of his life			0
it is certainly not an opportunity he can afford to waste			0
’ @entity18 sampled 1,002 people aged 16 and over in @entity46 from april 4 - to - 7			1
results have been compared with a previous @entity18 poll between march 6 and 7			0
the findings show that support for separation among women has fallen by 4 points since the last survey , dropping from 32.5 per cent to just 28.5 per cent			0
@entity38 sampled 1,024 people aged 16 and over from april 4 - to - 9 , and results were compared with a previous @entity38 poll in march			0
better together leader @entity169 said : ‘ it 's no surprise that @entity46 are rejecting @entity1 's negative and divisive campaign when he wo n't tell us what would replace the pound or how our essential public services , like schools and hospitals , would be funded			1
‘ there can be no complacency from those of us who want @entity46 to remain in the @entity36			2
we will do everything we can to convince those who have yet to make up their mind that we are stronger and better together as part of the @entity36			0
’ but @entity187 chief executive @entity186 said : ‘ these are extremely encouraging findings , which show that the referendum is wide open			2
‘ on these new ( @entity38 ) figures , yes just needs a three - point swing to move ahead - and we are very confident of achieving success in september			1
’ miss @entity53 will say today : ‘ to every @entity60 voter in the country , i say this : the @entity16 campaign is not asking you to leave your party			1
instead it offers you the chance to get your party back			0
‘ an independent @entity46 will not mean the end of @entity60 , but might mean a rejuvenated @entity60 – a @entity202 free to make its own decisions , a @entity202 that no longer needs to dance a @entity205 tune			2
‘ for everyone out there with @entity60 in your heart , the message is clear – do n’t vote no to stop the @entity11 , vote @entity16 to reclaim the @entity202			1
’ @entity53 , deputy first minister , issued a plea to @entity60 voters to back independence at the @entity214 in @entity9 miss @entity53 also announced an extra £ 1million for foodbanks in @entity46 as she courts the left - wing vote			1
despite the slump in support for separation , @entity11 activists will be delighted with the party political polling results in the @entity18 study			2
the @entity223 are on 44.9 per cent in the constituency vote for the next @entity226 election , with @entity60 trailing on 32.1 per cent – down nearly two points since march			0
the @entity228 are up 0.5 percentage points to 13.5 per cent , with the @entity230 on 5.7 per cent			0
@entity11 business convener @entity231 said : ‘ the fall in @entity60 support will undoubtedly set alarm bells ringing there , and raise further questions about @entity238 's leadership			0
’ but @entity239 , @entity60 's constitutional spokesman , said : ’ this is both desperate and dishonest from @entity53 who will clearly say anything to persuade people to vote to break up the @entity36			0
‘ @entity53 has been campaigning against @entity60 all her political life , in good times , and in bad times , and when we were lifting children and pensioners out of poverty , she still argued for nationalism			0
‘ the @entity60 works in partnership with people all over the @entity36 and beyond who share our values of fairness and equality and we reject @entity53 's narrow politics of division and grievance			0
‘ perhaps @entity53 would be better concentrating her campaigning efforts on the one in three @entity11 voters who do n't believe in separation			2

rallying cry from @entity11 leader as @entity16 vote slides in the polls again
latest survey gives the @entity19 campaign 10 - point lead

warning customers could force banks to quit independent @entity187
