by dr @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 21 september 2013 last week @entity1 ’s recalled its own - brand salads over fears that watercress had been contaminated with a rather nasty form of food poisoning – six people needed hospital treatment			2
last year , we investigated the dangers of bugs in bagged salad and found that the food poisoning bacteria @entity13 could be present in as many as one in 20 supermarket - bought salad leaves			1
levels were enough to cause illness			2
most people are careful when it comes to meat , fish and eggs but just throw salad from the bag to a bowl			2
poisoned plants : one in 20 bagged salads bought in the supermarket could contain @entity13 strain @entity30 i know salad bags say ‘ wash first ’ , but how dangerous is it not to ? @entity13 is a harmless resident of our gut – what is often termed ‘ friendly bacteria ’			1
the strain that caused this current and other outbreaks is called @entity30 and it is highly toxic to humans			1
when this strain enters the gut , it causes severe gastroenteritis			1
six per cent of people go on to develop a life - threatening kidney failure called haemolytic uraemic syndrome			2
infections such as @entity30 are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods			1
for salad to be affected , it must have been contaminated directly by waste			2
@entity56 lettuces are often grown in soil - free environments , but even this is no protection			2
the risk is from water used for irrigation , for example			0
if there is @entity13 lurking in salad , will a simple rinse under the tap be enough to get rid of it ? the @entity69 advises that all salad should be washed thoroughly by immersing in cold water , and also must not be contaminated by raw meat			1
storage of vegetables is key : if salad bags are in the fridge and the temperature is less than four degrees , bacteria will not multiply as rapidly			0
care to clean : ensure that all bought salad leaves are washed thoroughly before you eat them what about other foods you eat raw ? without scaremongering , there are plenty of different types of food poisoning from raw food , but hygienic practices and food standards protect us most of the time			0
@entity93 is possible from meat and salmonella is usually picked up from eating contaminated raw meat , eggs or dairy produce			0
the reason that these outbreaks make headlines is that thankfully they are not common			0
there are only about 200 cases a year of listeria in the @entity106			0
i ’ve had an @entity13 urine infection before			1
is that anything to do with food ? no it ’s not			0
@entity13 is the most common cause of bacterial urine infections in women in the @entity106 , accounting for more than 70 per cent of cases			1
this is from self - contamination , as in women everything is rather close together anatomically			0
to be completely blunt , this is why little girls should always be told ‘ wipe from front to back ’			0
fortunately , this strain is not related to @entity30 and is simple to treat are we becoming more prone to food poisoning as our lives become more sterile ? there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case			1
with the mass processing of food , the supply chain is still susceptible to contamination , as supposedly happened with this watercress , and we ca n’t be blase about that			0
when you look at figures over the past few years for food poisoning , rates of certain illnesses such as salmonella have steadily reduced , while @entity30 has increased			1
this is more to do with farming processes and contamination than our own immunity to these diseases .			0

one in 20 supermarket salads could contain @entity13 strain @entity30
the strain of @entity13 found can cause severe gastroenteritis
