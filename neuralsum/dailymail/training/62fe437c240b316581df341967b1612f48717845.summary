without his trademark : the court has ordered that @entity12 , seen here in a court sketch from monday , could not wear his hook for security reasons but is allowed to wear a prosthetic that allows him to write and take notes denied : @entity12 asked to give his opening statement himself but the judge ruled that he could not ‘ for @entity12 , his cause was war and it was all - consuming , ’ said prosecutor @entity21 on the first day of testimony			1
‘ his goals were clear , simple and vicious			0
all able - bodied @entity43 had a duty to wage war against non-muslims – a duty to kill			0
this duty was violent , global and mandatory			0
’ dressed in a light blue smock and alternating between scribbling notes and peering intently through his spectacles at evidence on a computer screen in front of him , @entity12 was a far cry in court from the fiery preacher who for years spouted hatred for the @entity60 and @entity24 in particular			1
his signature hook hands had been removed for security reasons , replaced by a pen - holding prosthetic on his right arm that allowed him to take notes			0

known figure : @entity12 , who was arrested under the name @entity76 , was arrested in the @entity77 and served a different sentence there before being extradited to the @entity24 ( pictured in 2003 ) he listened quietly as the prosecution painted a damning picture of a man who did far more than simply praise terrorism			1

he even compared him to @entity143 and @entity144 – both men , said mr @entity136 , who once been regarded as terrorists or rebels but who were now considered ‘ icons ’			0
@entity12 only espoused ‘ outrageous ’ views as imam at the mosque because he wanted to reach the entire @entity43 community and not be regarded as a ‘ sell - out ’ , the court heard			2
