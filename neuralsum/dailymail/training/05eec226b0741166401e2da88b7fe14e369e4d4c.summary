drivers could be banned from getting behind the wheel after just a single pint under tough new rules proposed by @entity4			2
the @entity5 on @entity6 called for a tightening on drink drive rules as part of a raft of measures to combat problem drinking			1
members also called for cigarette - style health warnings on wine bottles , a minimum price per unit of alcohol and a strengthening of the rules around advertising alchoholic products			1
' 1.2 million people a year are admitted to hospital due to alcohol ; liver disease in those under 30 has more than doubled over the past 20 years ; and the cost of alcohol to the economy totals Â£ 21 billion			2
' the group has called on political parties to commit to 10 recommendations which they say will help to minimise alcohol - related harm in the @entity30			1
chief among them is a reduction in the drink - drive limit from 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood to 50mg per 100ml , the @entity49 reported			1
so defined , the law would criminalise driving after a single pint of strong lager or a large glass of wine			0
younger drivers under the age of 21 would be targeted first			1
' the scale of alcohol misuse in the @entity30 speak for itself ' : @entity31 , @entity33 mp and chairman of the @entity5 on @entity6 ms @entity31 told @entity49 health editor @entity67 : ' we have one of the highest alcohol driving limits in the world			1
' we have seen drink - driving accidents increase over the past two years and we want to start by targeting younger drivers who are more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than older drivers			1
' the group also wants to see health warnings and more detailed nutritional labelling on alcohol products			1
the recommendation document states : ' health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products			2
likewise , detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks			0
' yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content			0
' in order to inform consumers about balanced risk , every alcohol label should include an evidence - based health warning as well as describing the product 's nutritional calorific and alcohol content			2
' lord @entity100 , vice-chairman of the group , said : ' after smoking , alcohol is the second biggest preventable killer			0
' not only does it cost lives but burdens the @entity107 and the criminal and justice systems and others with ever increasing costs			0
' all the political parties know that but they run for cover when they are confronted by the drinks industry and its immensely powerful lobby			0
' these proposals give them another chance to consider whether they really have the guts to take a different line for the country 's wellbeing in the future			0
' @entity126 , chief executive of @entity127 , added : ' we need urgent action to tackle this and the significant harmful effects alcohol misuse causes to individuals			2
' i hope all parties will read the manifesto and show a commitment to the vital measures which it highlights			0
' under current law , the @entity30 has one of the highest drink - drive limits in @entity142			1
most countries set the limit at either 0.5mg per ml of blood , the level proposed for under - 21s by the latest report			0
but in a significant chunk of the continent , the limit is just 0.2mg - equivalent to a very small tipple indeed .			0

@entity4 call drink - drive limit to be slashed first for younger drivers under 21
they also call for health warnings and curbs to alcohol advertising
