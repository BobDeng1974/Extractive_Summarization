by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 25 july 2013 scientists have discovered that @entity3 meteorites found on @entity4 could be four billion years younger than previously thought , meaning that @entity3 could still be geologically active			1
a team of researchers has shown that a meteorite from the @entity3 collection at the @entity9 in @entity10 started as a 200 million - year - old lava flow on @entity3			2
in a paper published today in the journal nature , a new technique using isotopic and micro-structural analysis is described to determine the age of rocks			1
following recent analysis , scientists claim that martian rocks found on earth left @entity3 20 million years ago			1
previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old scientists from the @entity25 , the @entity9 , the @entity26 and the @entity27 , claim that the rocks left @entity3 20 million years ago			1
previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old			1
‘ there has been a long debate about the actual age of precious @entity3 rocks that have been found on @entity4 , ’ said @entity29 , from the @entity30 and environmental sciences at the @entity25			2
‘ some scientists suggested they were formed as part of the ancient @entity3 crust and are therefore around 4,000 million years old - almost as old as the solar system itself			1
and others believed they were much younger			0
’ nearly 100 meteorites found on @entity4 are thought to be from @entity3			1
this pictures shows @entity44 and @entity45 , ancient inactive shield volcanoes in the @entity48 region of @entity3 the meteorites found on @entity4 have been ejected from @entity3 , probably after being dislodged by a large meteorite impact , and have eventually been hoovered up by @entity4			2
this process can cause extensive damage to the samples , including deformation and melting of the crystals that make up the rock			0
‘ the real challenge has been interpreting whether the measured age of the rock is the time at which it was formed or the time at which it was ejected from the @entity65 ’ , said @entity58			0
the team used a number of high resolution techniques to analyse the @entity3 crystals , examining samples much smaller than a human hair			0
the researchers combined isotopic analysis with micro-structural analysis , which means they looked at both the structure of the crystals and the chemistry to determine the growth history of the crystals			1
@entity29 , from the @entity30 and environmental sciences at the @entity25 , said the study is exciting not only because it provides a much better understanding of the geological activity on @entity3 , but the new technique can be used to analyse meteorites from the @entity86 and other asteroids @entity58 said : ‘ this is a really exciting study , not only because it gives us a much better understanding of the geological activity on @entity3 , but also because we can apply this new technique to meteorites from the @entity86 and other asteroids , which means we can start to analyse hundreds of rocks from the solar system			1
’ nearly 100 meteorites found on @entity4 are thought to be from @entity3			2
they are kept in collections all over the world and are hugely valuable scientifically as they provide researchers with unique insights into the history of the red planet			0
the scientists analysed a shergottite meteorite found in north @entity106 , which is kept at the @entity9			0
video : this research team directed energy beams at tiny crystals found in a @entity3 meteorite snow on ancient @entity3 is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there , according to @entity118 scientists			0
researchers at @entity120 have shown that some @entity3 valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation - moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes			0
scientists studied four different locations on @entity3 that they suspected had water - carved valleys , caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges			0
the new findings , published in @entity136 , are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient @entity3 and could shed new light on the planet 's early climate and atmosphere .			0

scientists combined isotopic and micro-structural analysis to *map* the structure of @entity3 meteorites
their findings suggest that the rocks left @entity3 20 million years ago
this is 4,000 million years earlier than previously thought and suggests that @entity3 may still be geologically active
