@entity0 is set to secure a £ 1.5 million pot of taxpayers ' cash by forming a new @entity5 - wide political party			1
the funding follows the formation of the @entity8 in @entity5 , a pan-european political party which is dominated by @entity0			1
@entity10 @entity0 mep @entity9 said if the @entity13 party did not take the money it would go to ‘ integrationist organisations ’ promoting ever - close union			1
@entity0 leader @entity17 has formed a new @entity18 in @entity5 to secure taxpayer funding but the decision has sparked a fresh row within the party – with some @entity23 fiercely opposed to taking the @entity25 funds			1
@entity9 @entity26 said there had been no consultation with members , adding : ‘ i think the feeling among the activists is that they wo n't be in favour of it			0
’ according to @entity36 's @entity35 , the new party could be approved by the @entity37 later this week , with the funding - which could be used on research , administration and advertising , but not for the @entity43 general election campaign - following in april next year			1
the new party , currently made up mostly of @entity23 , is entitled to £ 1m of @entity45 funding next year , @entity35 reported			1
an accompanying foundation , called the @entity47 in @entity5 , will support @entity48 and is entitled to a grant of £ 580,000			2
mr @entity9 told the programme the money could otherwise be available to ‘ the @entity53 or other foundations which promote further integration ’			2
he said : ‘ we are going to be criticised by those who say ' you should turn your back on this money , you should take a principled stand and refuse it '			0
‘ but it does n't make any difference to the taxpayer			0
‘ if we do n't take the money , it will not go back to the member state of the taxpayer			0
it will simply go to those other foundations committed to further @entity5 integration			2
’ socialist mep @entity69 ( left ) is the president of the @entity37 , while @entity70 ( right ) is president of the commission he added : ‘ we think that if there are resources available , we want to get them			2
‘ so the question for any @entity0 supporter who has a reasonable issue here is - would you rather this money , which is @entity43 taxpayers ' money , would you rather this money was given to one of the @entity53 or other foundations which promote further @entity5 integration , or would you rather some of the money goes to us to oppose @entity5 integration ? ‘ we are doing it precisely so we can liberate some of that money that would otherwise go to integrationist organisations			1
’ but mr @entity26 said @entity0 had rejected the idea of creating a new party , which is a different organisation from the @entity92 political grouping formed by @entity17 and his allies in the @entity37			1
mr @entity26 told @entity35 : ‘ i 'm not interested in being part of a @entity5 political party			1
the members of @entity0 were n't asked			2
there 's been no consultation			0
’ @entity9 @entity9 said the money would go to ‘ integrationist organisations ’ if @entity0 did not take it the idea was rejected in 2011 following an ‘ expensive ’ referendum , ’ he said			1
‘ i ca n't think of any arguments that would make me want to join			0
i think the feeling among the activists is that they wo n't be in favour of it			0
’ @entity109 , who ran against mr @entity17 for the party 's leadership in 2010 and led the internal referendum campaign opposed to forming a @entity113 , said : ‘ in 2011 @entity0 held a big internal debate on the issue			1
‘ the party membership voted two to one against @entity0 's affiliation to a @entity113			1
’ that was the clear and unambiguous democratic verdict of the party membership after a big debate extending over several months			0
‘ i am much saddened that the leadership should now have decided to ignore and overrule the clearly expressed view of the party membership			0
’ it is understood that that party 's ruling @entity126 backed the decision , giving individual @entity0 @entity23 the choice of whether to sign up			1
all but two of the party 's 24 meps are expected to be on board , with just mr @entity26 and @entity136 opposed to the move , a @entity0 source in @entity25 said			1
the news comes after a chaotic few days for @entity0 , which saw @entity140 quit as a candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments			2
in recordings of phone calls obtained by the @entity148 , the would - be mp was said to have mocked gay party members as ‘ poofters ’ , joked about shooting people from @entity152 in a ‘ peasant hunt ’ and referred to someone as a ‘ chinky bird ’			0
they were revealed just days after he was reinstated as the party 's general election candidate in @entity158			0
he initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong pain killers			0
but in a statement , he said : ‘ i have this evening offered my resignation as @entity165 ( prospective parliamentary candidate ) for @entity158			0
‘ i want the best for @entity158 and i want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people			0
‘ therefore i have chosen to resign so that @entity0 can win this seat next may			2

funding follows formation of the @entity18 in @entity5
the pan-european political party in @entity37 is dominated by @entity0
