when @entity3 was born with a giant strawberry birthmark , her mother and father wanted to show she was just like everyone else			1
but their act of devotion has gone beyond even the most caring parents ' wildest dreams			2
@entity11 and @entity12 each adorned their legs with mammoth tattoos , mimicking perfectly the blemishes which run up the right side of their 18 - month - old daughter 's body			1
devotion : @entity3 ( centre ) was born with a harmless but disfiguring strawberry birthmark - so to show she is just like everyone else , her parents have each had tattoos of the same blotches ( left and right ) supportive : father @entity12 and his wife @entity11 constantly tell @entity3 ( left ) that she is beautiful the proud couple , from @entity32 , @entity33 , were in tears when they first saw @entity3 after she was born in 2013			1
although her strawberry birthmark is completely harmless , they were afraid the skin blotches - which affect one in ten children - could harm @entity3 's self - confidence when she grew up			1
when her daughter was barely a year old , mrs @entity3 was horrified to discover pensioners pointing at her and whispering next to a shop till			1
so for @entity44 she paid for the two - and - a - half - hour , £ 80 procedure on her husband 's leg - with plasterer mr @entity12 repaying the favour ahead of her 40th birthday this week			1
@entity50 : mrs @entity3 already had a tattoo on her right leg , but has added to what she had before mrs @entity3 said : ‘ most people might think it ’s very extreme but to us it was the natural thing to do to ensure our daughter never felt different or alone in the world			1
’ recounting the moment she first saw her daughter 's birthmark , the proud mother said ‘ she struggled to breathe when she was first born and was rushed to the special care unit			1
when i went to see her she was just lying in a little incubator and that ’s when i saw it			2
' it broke my heart			2
i just sobbed and sobbed knowing my baby was going to permanently marked for the rest of her life			0
‘ like any mum i did n’t want her to be different			0
i wanted her to be exactly the same as every other healthy child			2
and as much as the birthmark is n’t dangerous , i knew it could have a huge impact on the rest of her life			2
‘ although in our eyes she was perfect , i knew other people would cruelly point and stare at her			0
for the first few months of her life , whenever we went out , i made sure her legs were covered up			0
i could n’t cope with stranger ’s curious glances or whispering comments			0
’ ‘ i did n’t want sympathy or pity or people feeling sorry for @entity3			1
@entity12 and i decided straight away that we wanted @entity3 to feel special , that her birthmark was something to feel proud of and not embarrassed by			1
' from the moment she was born , we told @entity3 she was beautiful and constantly covered her in kisses			1
' but when she noticed an elderly couple ' whispering and staring ' at her daughter , mrs @entity3 was ' distraught ' and decided she had to take action			1
' it was the first time i had taken her out without covering her up and it confirmed all my worries and fears , ' she said			0
' people are cruel without even realising			0
and i knew if adults could be that insensitive , then kids at school would also be unintentionally mean			0
‘ we had talked about having duplicate tattoos done for a little while but that day my mind was made up			0
we knew we had to do something to ensure @entity3 grew up knowing she was very much loved			1
’ @entity50 : honey - @entity3 's birthmark , pictured , is harmless but caused strangers to whisper at a shop checkout she added : ‘ it was incredibly painful , especially as i had a flower to cover some old star tattoos , but it was worth every second of the pain			1
‘ when the swelling went down , i showed @entity3 , and she gently touched it and smiled as she said “ match ” , pointing to her own leg			1
‘ if i ’d have needed any reassurance that i ’d made the right decision that was it			0
‘ she now constantly touches mine and @entity12 ’s tattoos then her own birthmark and giggles - i could n’t be happier			1
‘ some people will says it odd and think what we ’ve done is quite extreme , but in our eyes all we have done is ensure @entity3 never feels different			2
@entity143 and @entity144 now have the same permanent markings as she does			0
’ condition : known medically as haemangiomas , strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin			0
they affect one in ten babies but most of the time they are completely harmless the couple already had tattoos on their legs , but none as extreme as the imitation birthmarks			2
known medically as haemangiomas , strawberry birthmarks are an abnormal cluster of blood vessels just under the skin which can vary hugely in size			0
they get their name from their appearance , which can mimic the pattern and colouring of the summer fruit			0
most are harmless and do not need to be treated , with some types fading over time while others stay on the skin permanently			2
occasionally birthmarks need to be treated if they develop into ulcers or block the airways , but other people have them removed for cosmetic reasons			0
many can be removed with medicines , while others require laser treatment or even plastic surgery , according to the @entity184 .			0
