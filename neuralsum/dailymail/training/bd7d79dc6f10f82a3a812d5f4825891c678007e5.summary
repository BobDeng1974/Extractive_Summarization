@entity0 by @entity1 during may 1940 , the @entity4 blitzkrieg swept through @entity5 in a matter of days			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 too were crushed with lightning speed			0
@entity12 stood alone against @entity14 ’s domination of @entity15			1
the traditional view of what happened next has long been that we were saved only by the superiority of the @entity21 ’s @entity20 and @entity22 to the @entity24 ’s @entity23 , and the gallantry of the men who flew them			2
if we had lost the @entity28 , all that stood between us and a fascist future was the @entity31 , a @entity32 of oldsters armed with broomsticks			1
@entity35 : the @entity31 ( inspiration for tv show @entity32 ) were a formidable force @entity1 ’s engrossing , forensic review of the evidence challenges that idea and exposes some myths along the way			1
not only was @entity12 well armed and prepared , but the @entity43 were n’t very eager to invade us anyway			1
at the time @entity5 fell and the @entity46 scrambled its way home from @entity49 , there was no @entity43 plan to invade @entity12			1
@entity14 , a huge admirer of the @entity52 and the way it was run , expected us to seek peace terms			1
and there were plenty this side of the channel who wanted to , especially some @entity62 members of the coalition government , led by foreign secretary lord @entity64			0
of course , @entity67 was fiercely opposed to any settlement , and his stance held sway with the support of @entity72 and @entity74 members of the government			0
' we shall fight them on the beaches ' : @entity67 inspects the guard of honour of the @entity31 faced with @entity12 ’s defiance , @entity14 himself disagreed with some of his military staff , who were eager to continue the momentum across @entity15 and finish the job			1
he had no interest in naval warfare and believed that , isolated from imports by a @entity89 cordon , @entity12 would be worn down until she made terms			1
25,000 @entity92 were made homeless in the first two weeks of the @entity93 there were good military reasons for his caution , too			0
mostly there was the @entity99 , the mightiest sea force in the world with ten times as many ships as the @entity43 had and the right ones too , 13 battleships to their two , 169 destroyers to their ten			0
even if @entity43 succeeded in attaining air superiority , it would be risky to take hundreds of troop - carrying craft across the notoriously choppy @entity109 while under fire from our ships			2
to put the difficulty into context , going the other way , four years later , the @entity113 took two years planning and rehearsing d - day , had massive air and sea superiority and even then only just made it			2
@entity67 himself was sceptical about the threat of invasion			0
and contrary to myth , @entity12 was well prepared			1
well - armed and well - prepared : @entity31 patrol on a country road near @entity126 @entity52 factories were turning out fighter planes faster than the @entity43 , with nearly 500 being produced in july alone			1
and we had a massive army			0
by mid-july we had 1,300,000 regular troops , plus 600,000 @entity31 — later renamed the @entity31 by @entity67			1
while it ’s true the latter included at least one man as old as @entity32 ’s @entity136 , the average age was actually 35			1
rather than being a bunch of well - meaning duffers led by pompous twits , most were former servicemen with sound military knowledge			2
and although they initially had no weapons and trained with broomsticks , they were soon well equipped with 615,000 rifles from the @entity148 putting up a fight : @entity1 's admirable book sets the record about the @entity31 straight all in all , they could have put up a decent fight			1
it ’s also a mistake to forget the stunningly efficient way that countless pillboxes and other defences were thrown up around the country			2
unfortunately , this fed paranoid rumours that the invasion was imminent			0
one rumour — repeated in @entity32 — claimed that a force of @entity43 dressed as nuns was spreading across the country , although they could be detected by their hairy forearms			1
it was also feared @entity43 paratroopers might land dressed in @entity52 uniforms taken from men who had been captured at @entity49			0
@entity172 advised that the simplest way to rumble them was to make them take off their helmets — as ‘ the very marked square - head of the @entity178 can easily be recognised ’			2
in mid-july , smarting under @entity180 insults , @entity14 finally gave the go - ahead for the invasion , codenamed @entity0			1
as it was considered an impos - sible undertaking beyond mid-september because of worsening weather , he gave his underlings a month to prepare			0
it was a logistical nightmare			0
the @entity43 possessed no landing craft , troop carriers that could be driven right up onto a beach			0
they rapidly began amassing a collection of barges and other commercial boats from all over @entity15 , 1,910 in total , plus 419 tugs to tow them			2
as the tugs could n’t pull them right to the shore , the men would have to jump out in deep water and wade to land under fire			0
post-invasion plans included taking all able - bodied @entity12 aged 17 - 45 to @entity43 as slave labour , and @entity203 ’s column to @entity204			1
but it was all pie in the sky			0
the @entity21 began making raids on the assembling invasion force , damaging 12 per cent of it , a demonstration of what might happen to an actual attempt			0
the @entity99 attacked @entity43 ships in port , while back home the security forces proved remarkably adept at rounding up @entity43 spies			0
formidable and dangerous foe : footage of home guard soldiers training during the early months of the war after a bombastic speech on september 4 that an invasion was imminent , @entity14 again began to have cold feet			1
the finalenail in the coffin was september 15 , @entity227 , when the @entity21 downed 60 @entity43 fighters , for a loss of 26			0
clearly @entity43 did not command the skies			0
two days later , the @entity231 announced that @entity0 was postponed and the fleet began dispersing because of @entity21 bombing attacks			0
it proved the end of @entity236 , as @entity14 ’s attention turned @entity238 and @entity239 , the attack on @entity240 the following year			1
far from being a sitting duck , @entity12 — even at its loneliest and most exposed — had proved too dangerous and formidable a foe for the @entity244 to tackle head - on			1
in our self - deprecating way , we rather forget how ruthless and proficient our preparations against invasion actually were and tend to treat this particular chapter of our national story almost as a joke			2
@entity1 ’s admirable book sets the record straight .			0

during may 1940 @entity12 stood alone against @entity14 ’s domination of @entity15
many believe all that stood between us and a fascist future was the @entity31 , a @entity32 of oldsters armed with broomsticks
in fact @entity12 was too formidable a foe for the @entity244 to tackle head - on
far from being a joke , the @entity31 was well armed and well prepared
