by @entity0 last updated at 4:36 pm on 12th october 2011 @entity2 prime minister @entity1 will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to mps ahead of a crucial confidence vote			1
@entity1 , 75 , is currently involved in four trials - including one for having sex with an underage prostitute - and will attempt to rally @entity4 and reassure them he is still capable of running the country , which is teetering on the edge of a financial meltdown			1
in - party squabbling between members of his ruling right - wing coalition meant that many failed to turn up for a crucial vote on the state of the country 's public accounts earlier this week - a vote that @entity1 lost			2
no way out ? @entity2 prime minister @entity1 will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to mps ahead of a crucial confidence vote @entity1 will speak to parliament in @entity27 at 11am on thursday morning - just 24 hours after @entity2 's president @entity28 called for '' credible answers ' from the country 's government			1
the confidence vote will take place on friday and , if he loses , @entity1 - whose reputation has come under scrutiny following revelations of his sordid ' bunga bunga ' sex parties - will have no option but to resign			1
this would mean a general election ahead of the scheduled 2013 ballot			0
following the defeat in the @entity2 lower house earlier this week there were chants from opposition benches of ' resign , resign ' and even some of his own allies were questioning whether he could still remain in power after such a public humiliation which dominated tv and newspaper headlines			0
put up or shut up : the confidence vote will take place on friday and , if he loses , @entity1 will have no option but to resign a front page editorial in @entity59 newspaper headlined ' @entity60 ' said that the defeat for @entity1 in the vote was a ' devastating and defining politically ' for him and his centre right coalition			1
however , @entity1 remained upbeat with sources saying he was confident of carrying the confidence vote - one of several he has faced in his political career - and that he would be stressing in his speech how it was ' irresponsible ' of the opposition to try and topple the government when the country is facing an economic crisis			1
@entity73 , leader of @entity1 's @entity74 in parliament , said : ' the prime minister will address the @entity77 on thursday and will then ask for their confidence on friday			0
' the vote is the only way of measuring the relationship between government and parliament			0
' the opposition are making a mistake if they think the loss earlier this week was a sign of no confidence in the government - there is a difference between a vote of confidence and a no confidence vote			1
' political commentators say the chances of @entity1 losing the vote are slim as he and party whips will ensure the 30 or so @entity4 missing from the vote earlier this week are in attendance			2
nightclub dancer @entity100 ( left ) and escort girl @entity100 have been named in connection with sex parties allegedly held by @entity1 opposition leader @entity103 , of the @entity104 , said : ' this is the 53rd vote of confidence that has been called and it is now becoming a joke - the only clear position is his resignation			2
' @entity2 - the third largest economy in the @entity112 - has a debt of more than Â£ 1trillion or 120 per cent of its gdp			0
despite introducing a belt tightening 53billion euro austerity package earlier this summer there are fears the country is heading the same way as neighbour @entity122			0
financial ratings agencies and commentators say the lack of strong leadership from @entity1 and the internal squabbling indicate that he is not strong enough to carry through policies and reforms to save the country 's economy			0
besides the underage sex case which resumes next month , he is also on trial for corruption and abuse of office and one commentator said he was spending more time ' talking to his lawyers then governing and should be talking more to @entity140 the head of the @entity142			0

the 75 - year - old will speak to @entity4 tomorrow ahead of confidence vote on friday
if he loses , @entity1 will almost certainly have to quit
