magic from @entity1 at times i ’ve felt like a bit of an apologist for @entity1			1
at @entity6 on sunday , he showed his class			0
all game his touch was like velvet and he showed fantastic technical quality with two devastating finishes			0
i ’ve heard some @entity14 fans and ex-pros saying he ’s got no pace or he ca n’t do this or that			0
when he gets in the right place at the right time , he can cut open any team			1
he has a fantastic football brain and his decision - making is so quick that he does n’t need to be fast			2
if you can read the game that well and take up intelligent positions then pace is not necessary			0
nothing moves faster than the ball			0
@entity1 scored twice as @entity14 beat @entity33 at @entity6 - he showed his class throughout @entity1 has a fantastic footballing brain his decision - making is so quick that he does n’t need to be fast @entity1 has made 91 passes in his last two games , more than any other @entity14 midfielder sunday ’s performance was a nod to all those who have written him off			1
he was good against @entity42 but he was sensational at @entity6			0
the acid test for any player is how well you perform in big games and they do n’t get any bigger than @entity33 against @entity14			1
it was a game for cool heads and that ’s what @entity1 had			1
it ’s a shame the same ca n’t be said for @entity53			0
watching on , he will have been at boiling point			0
he must have been wondering why he was on the bench when players not in his class were struggling to make an impact on the pitch			0
but even though i have some sympathy , that ’s still no excuse			0
@entity53 will have been fired up after coming off the bench but there is no excuse for what he did it 's perfect for @entity70 @entity71 was delighted after @entity72 came back to win at @entity73			1
when he left @entity76 for @entity72 , even he could n’t have seen things going this well			1
he is at a club where he ’s loved and since the switch @entity72 ’s results have been far superior to @entity76 ’s			2
six wins and a draw means @entity72 have overtaken @entity76 , so all credit to him			1
@entity86 must be in dreamland what a week for @entity88			2
he gets called up for @entity90 duty and responds with a first @entity92 hat - trick			1
the boy is on fire			0
last month i picked him out as my player of the season			2
a few people might have laughed at me for that , but i ’m sure they ’re not laughing any more			0
only one player could take it off @entity88 now , and that ’s @entity103 , but with three more goals , @entity88 ’s done nothing to make me change my mind			1
@entity88 scored his first @entity92 hat - trick against @entity108 and is still my player of the season @entity110 booming @entity110 has always been a big rugby area , but it ’s got a great football tradition as well and @entity113 added his own chapter of history at @entity116 on sunday			1
@entity117 controlled the game in the @entity120 final and deserved their success			1
@entity113 is an excellent coach and an ambitious manager and that result should set them up to go on and win @entity125			2
with excellent fans and committed backers , it ’s time for @entity117 to dream big			1
@entity113 's @entity117 deserve their success and should go on and win @entity125 this season @entity129 close in when i saw the score at the @entity132 go to 2 - 2 , i started to look at the league table			1
would this bring @entity117 back into the title race ? would it give @entity137 a sniff ? were @entity14 even in with a chance ? then @entity141 scores a late goal and @entity129 keep their lead at the top			1
when we look back at the end of the season , that could well be the result that wins @entity129 the title			2
after going out of the @entity149 and drawing at home to @entity151 , a draw at @entity153 would have piled the pressure on			0
defensively they were poor and @entity156 and @entity157 found @entity153 ’s pace hard to deal with			0
now they have breathing space			0
they have tough games to come , including @entity14 and @entity33 at home and @entity137 away , but results like this will help get them over the line			2
@entity129 's win against @entity153 on sunday could prove to be the result that wins them the title what more @entity172 do ? the last time @entity174 had 42 points at this stage of a @entity92 season was in 2007 - 08			1
that year they finished 10th with 49 points in total it may not have been a pretty watch at @entity183 on saturday , but it was a significant win for @entity174 and @entity184			1
victory over @entity186 took the club to 42 points , which is more than they won in the whole of last season			2
and i do n’t care what anybody says , @entity184 has done a good job at @entity174			1
he saved them from relegation last year , rebuilt over the summer and some of their attacking football in the first half of the season was fantastic to watch			0
but for whatever reason , his face does n’t seem to fit and i suspect he will move on in the summer			0
if that happens , i ’m sure there will be plenty of suitors for @entity184			2
he is a talented manager and something of a relegation specialist , so do n’t be surprised if he waits until a struggling club comes calling			0
@entity184 has done a good job at @entity174 despite what people say - some of their football is fantastic meeting the maestro it was a privilege to be at the @entity218 last week to see @entity219 put in a magical performance in the @entity149			1
i used to worry that we might have seen the best of the little magician			0
his delivery to set up @entity227 ’s opener in @entity228 on sunday night was spot on and he was sensational against @entity117 last week			2
the only problem was he would n’t stop bugging me and @entity231 for a photo ... @entity219 ( centre ) poses for a photograph with @entity235 and @entity236 at the @entity218			0

@entity1 was excellent against @entity33 and can cut open any team
@entity71 deserves credit for the job he is doing at @entity72
@entity88 is still my player of the season after his first top *flight* hat - trick
@entity117 deserve success and should dream big after @entity116 win
@entity174 have more points than last season - what more can @entity184 do ?
