it was always going to be unwise naming a restaurant that glorifies unhealthy food the @entity3			1
and on saturday the inevitable happened when a customer suffered a cardiac arrest in the chain 's @entity7 branch			1
an onlooker captured video of paramedics wheeling the unidentified man , thought to be in his 40s , out of the fast - food diner			1
he was midway through eating a 6,000 - calorie @entity15 when he began experiencing chest pains			1
he denied the incident was an elaborate publicity stunt			0
mr @entity36 told @entity41 : ' the gentleman could barely talk			0
he was sweating , suffering			0
' i actually felt horrible for him because the tourists were taking photos of him as if it were some type of stunt			0
' even with our own morbid sense of humour , we would never pull a stunt like that			0
' the @entity3 sells calorie - laden fare with names such as @entity55			1
controversial : the restaurant , which promises free food to the obese , is located on @entity59 's @entity58 meals can exceed 8,000 calories			1
the recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men			0
the @entity24 contains three slabs of meat , 12 rashes of bacon , cheese , red onion , sliced tomato and the @entity3 's own ' unique special sauce '			1
and that 's before taking into account the accompanying ' @entity76 ' , cooked in pure lard , and a giant soft drink			1
accentuating the medical theme , waitresses dressed as nurses deliver the artery - clogging food			2
a sign at the entrance to an @entity86 restaurant reads : ' go away			2
if you come in this place , it â€™s going to kill you			0
' but the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers			0
scantily - clad : a waitress leaves little to the imagination			2
@entity3 meals can exceed 8,000 calories in an exploitative advertising campaign , the restaurant announced that it would pick up the bill for any patron who weighed more than 25 - stone			1
mr @entity36 hired a 46 - stone man , @entity104 , to star in a tongue - in - cheek commercial promoting the special offer			1
in the ad , mr @entity36 says with a smile : ' i personally guarantee a stable upward progression of body weight while you 're enjoying great tasting foods			0
' along with a cold beer and cigarette , it 's a diet you can stick to for life			2
' the advertisement then states the side affects from eating @entity3 food ' may include sudden weight gain , repeated increase of wardrobe size , back pain , male breast growth , loss of sexual partners , lung cancer , tooth decay and liver sclerosis stroke			2
' in some cases mild death may occur			0
