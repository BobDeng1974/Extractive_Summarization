by @entity0 , political editor published : 18:52 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 18:53 est , 10 september 2012 shake - up : @entity2 plans to replace gcses with a more rigorous , o - level style of exam @entity2 will this week press ahead with reforms designed to fix the ‘ broken ’ exam system as he vows to replace gcses with a more rigorous , o - level style of exam			1
the education secretary is expected to unveil plans to introduce a new qualification before the next election in 2015 , arguing that @entity10 ‘ have n’t worked ’			2
there has been a bitter row within the coalition over mr @entity2 ’s proposals , with @entity20 vowing to oppose any return to a ‘ two - tier ’ system that would see less gifted children sitting different exams			1
the @entity25 has conceded that the ‘ overwhelming majority ’ of students should sit the new qualifications - but insists they must properly recognise the best students			1
in a little - noticed move , the new conservative education minister @entity31 has been handed responsibility for exam reform following last week ’s government reshuffle , rather than mr @entity2 ’s new @entity20 number two , @entity37			1
the proposals will be put out for consultation before the new examination is introduced in 2014			0
‘ i think one of the things that ’s important to stress is that the o - level is an examination which in the past used to be sat by a minority , which is why when people have discussed its potential return they ’ve automatically assumed it would be a minority exam , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ but in fact , in other jurisdictions , in countries like @entity56 , there are examinations which are set which are very reminiscent of the old o - level , but a majority ... 80 per cent of students can pass them			1
‘ i think what we need to do is to have an examination that has all the rigour of the old o - level but which is sat by a majority of students , so that we can ensure that everyone is treated fairly			1
‘ it ’s the aim is that it should be sat by the overwhelming majority			0
it ’s not the case at the moment that every child sits a gcse			0
but we want to make sure that this is an examination that can be sat by all children and cover the full range of abilities			0
’ the @entity25 has conceded that the ' overwhelming majority ' of students should sit the new qualifications - but insists they must properly recognise the best students the education secretary says the government will consult experts , teachers and parents on what the new examination , and its grades , should be called			1
‘ the aim is to ensure that we have an examination that recognises the genuinely academically gifted by making sure that top grade , an a or whatever it might be called , is clearly a sign of someone who is a high flier , but at the same time , this examination , we hope , will ensure that all children - we hope the majority will take it at 16 , some may take it at the age of 17 or 18 - that all children can have their fluency in @entity111 , mathematics and other subjects like history and physics recognised			2
‘ i think it ’s important that there ’s an appropriate discrimination between the top grades and then a lower pass grade , but the precise details of how that should be done is something that we need to agree collectively			0
’ the latest figures show that hundreds of state schools are already turning away from the traditional gcse and offering pupils a tougher international exam based on o - levels			2
the number teaching the international @entity10 ( @entity130 ) has soared by 300 per cent since mr @entity2 allowed them to start doing so			0
two - thirds of public schools already enter students for the @entity135 , regarded as more challenging and similar to o - levels			2
unlike gcses , the exams are also favoured because they do not focus on coursework			0
@entity140 banned state schools from adopting @entity130 in key subjects amid fears they would undermine the domestic version , with schools which sought to get around the ban facing official warnings			0
but in june 2010 , mr @entity2 reversed the ban , insisting schools which believed the international exams would better stretch pupils should be allowed to offer them .			0

@entity20 have vowed to oppose any return to a ' two - tier ' system
