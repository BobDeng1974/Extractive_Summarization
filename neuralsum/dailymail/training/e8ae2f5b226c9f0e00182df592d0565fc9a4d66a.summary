double standards : @entity1 attacked free schools but called one in his @entity5 constituency ' inspiring ' labour frontbenchers were branded hypocrites last night after denouncing the government ’s free schools while backing them in their own constituencies			1
at least 21 @entity10 are supporting free schools in their local areas – including four members of the @entity14 and another six @entity16 frontbenchers			1
teaching unions have opposed free schools , which are set up by teachers and parents , because they are not subject to many local authority controls			1
and @entity16 @entity10 have largely fallen into line behind the union position			0
earlier this month at the @entity25 , @entity24 attacked education secretary @entity27 ’s free school ‘ experiment ’ , saying : ‘ we have been absolutely clear that we are not going to have new free schools under a @entity16 government			1
’ and education spokesman @entity1 , who will address the @entity16 conference tomorrow , has confirmed he would prevent any more being set up if his party wins the 2015 election			2
referring to free schools in june , he dismissed them with the remark : ‘ we do n’t like them			2
’ but mr @entity1 sang a different tune when he hailed the @entity39 in his own @entity5 constituency as ‘ inspiring ’			0
similarly , @entity16 ’s health spokesman @entity41 attended the ‘ founders ’ ceremony ’ for the @entity44 free school in his @entity46 constituency near @entity47 – despite calling such schools ‘ freaky ’			2
the party ’s justice spokesman @entity50 has also enthusiastically supported a free school in @entity53 , south @entity54			0
and @entity16 ’s deputy leader @entity55 proudly advertised the ‘ new facilities ’ of such a school in her @entity54 constituency on her website			0
mixed messages : shadow health secretary @entity41 went to the founders ' ceremony of a school near his constituency in @entity46 @entity24 ’s opposition to free schools did not stop his personal aide @entity67 , the mp for @entity68 , praising the @entity69 in her seat as ‘ welcome ’			1
she said it will make ‘ an important contribution to the continuing improvement of standards ’			0
as well as this , @entity75 , one of the party ’s education spokesmen , said she was ‘ pleased that parents and children are now able to take up places at @entity82 ’ – a free school in her @entity85 and @entity86 constituency			0
@entity16 ’s most influential backbencher @entity87 , who runs the @entity88 – the @entity90 spending watchdog – has previously attacked free schools as ‘ vanity projects ’			1
but mrs @entity87 led a campaign for a free school in @entity95 , east @entity54 , demanding £ 25million of funding to give the children in her constituency ‘ the best possible education ’			0
@entity100 , chairman of the @entity101 , joined mr @entity27 at the opening of the @entity104 free school in @entity105			0
and frontbencher @entity106 has welcomed not one but two new free schools in @entity108 – the @entity107 and the @entity109			2
a source close to mr @entity27 , who championed the free schools programme , said : ‘ this sort of shameless hypocrisy is exactly why people hate politicians			1
' @entity24 and @entity1 should drop their official opposition to free schools and tell their union paymasters that raising school standards is now their priority			1

*senior* labour figures have *repeatedly* attacked free schools
but more than 20 of the party *'s* *mps* have also supported free schools in their area
critics attack ' shameless hypocrisy ' of figures including @entity1 , @entity41 and @entity100
