a romantic proposal is enough to leave anyone feeling breathless - especially if , like these couples , you 're entirely submerged in water			1
these beautiful images feature spouses - to - be embracing in a crystal clear pool , posing in evening gowns and black tie to announce they 're tying the knot in an inventive alternative to the traditional engagement picture			1
they are the work of @entity15 underwater photographer @entity14 from @entity16 , who said : ' the year 2015 is bringing in so many new trends that are innovative , fun , and unique			1
one of those new trends that i am starting with my clients is an underwater engagement shoot			0
' @entity14 , who also creates ethereal underwater portraits of pregnant women , will help bring the couples ' engagement visions to life			1
he said : ' whether my clients are into high - end fashion with @entity43 ’s , the exciting world of @entity45 or even a @entity47 lifestyle , we are creating art on a whole new level to celebrate their uniqueness and engagement			2
' in one mesmerising photo , a woman in a white dress looks like she 's floating through the sky as she holds a bunch of red balloons as sunlight penetrates the water and breaks through a mass of fluffy white clouds			2
many duos have worn their smartest outifts - the men in suits , the women in brightly coloured long gowns , that billow in the water - to be photographed sharing a tender kiss , their hair streaming out behind them			1
@entity14 said : ' every couple that comes to me looking for something different and unique always has a story			2
i love bringing each person ’s character into the photo shoot and letting them show me what makes them unique as a couple			0
most couples wear their finest clothes , like this bride - to - be in flowing red gown and strappy gold heels and her fiance who wears a tuxedo @entity92 allows each couple to express their characters through their photographs with each of his images seeing a unique and personal theme ' by putting them into the water , there are so many fun things we can do with the near weightless environment that would not be possible in a standard engagement shoot			1
' this is shown to best advantage in the snaps of couples floating in the water , swimming towards each other , or one man holding his apparently feather - light fiancée on his knee			1
the photographer , from @entity117 , has always had a passion for water and says : ' i ’ve practically lived in the ocean my whole life			0
i am an adrenaline junkie who loves to travel			0
' @entity14 's images vary from the very romantic to the comical depending on the couple 's style , this pair chose a morning routine as their theme @entity14 said he can create a far greater variety of fun images in this near weightless environment than with a standard engagement shoot although most couples choose to buy outfits specifically for the shoot @entity14 says some have worn designer pieces from @entity139 and @entity140 @entity14 says he was taught the tricks of the trade by a world - renowned fashion photographer			1
' i have traveled all over the world photographing the beauty in people , places , and animals everywhere i could , ' he said			0
despite the underwater setting @entity14 says that his photo shoots see some couples dressed to the nines to perfect their engagement pictures			2
' most couples do not wear their best clothes but actually buy clothing for the shoot			0
i do have some couples that have shot in very high end fashion such as @entity139 or @entity140			2
' as long as the clothes are dry - cleaned they do not get ruined			0
' a beaming woman in a cobalt blue dress seems to fly down to her fiance , lying at the bottom of the pool filled with crystal clear water the photographer has dealt with several different themes , including this @entity47 couple who added @entity174 elements to their shoot other couples have been even more inventive incorporating their favourite films , such as @entity45 into the final image @entity14 recommended that women only wear minimal make - up to be photographed underwater such as waterproof mascara and lipstick @entity14 has captured some classically romantic images underwater , here both couples appear to be sharing a passionate embrace as they dance @entity14 has photographed dozens of couples but he said he still sees a unique side to every image as each individual pair brings their own character to the shoot			1
' this is all about the couple celebrating each other in their own style			0
some bring costumes underwater , others bring their @entity200 , ' he said			0
' the shoots are a lot of fun			0
most couples end up feeling like kids again being able to play in the water with their clothes on ! ' @entity14 has photographed dozens of couples but says very pair bring their own unique side and interests to their engagement shoot @entity14 said that he aims to bring ' love and fun ' to his photo shoots , with the shots of fully clothed couples posing entirely submerged @entity14 says he has seen a real rise in demand for his unique underwater photography , in which couples have fun posing together			1
