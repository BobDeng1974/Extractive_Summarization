by @entity0 it is set to be one of the best summers in history for sun watchers			0
tonight will see the first of three ' supermoons ' , where the sun appears far bigger and brighter than normal			2
july 12th , august 10th , and sept. 9th will all be supermoons , @entity9 said , with august 's being ' extra super '			1
on saturday a perigee moon coincides with a full moon creating a super moon when it will pass by the earth at its closest point the supermoon is not the technical term for the @entity26			1
astronomers call this phenomenon a ' perigee moon , ' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to @entity33 each year			1
@entity34 marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around @entity33 , while apogee marks the farthest point from @entity33			0
full moons vary in size because of the oval shape of the @entity43 's orbit			1
the @entity43 follows an elliptical path around @entity33 with one side ( ' perigee ' ) about 50,000 km closer than the other ( ' apogee ' )			1
full moons that occur on the perigee side of the @entity43 's orbit seem extra big and bright			1
this coincidence happens three times in 2014			0
on july 12th and sept 9th the @entity43 becomes full on the same day as perigee			1
on august 10th it becomes full during the same hour as perigee - arguably making it an extra-super @entity43			1
however , @entity54 of the @entity55 say the phenomenon is not actually that rare - it 's just that we normally miss it			2
' generally speaking , full moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days , so it 's not all that unusual , ' he says			1
' in fact , just last year there were three perigee moons in a row , but only one was widely reported			2
' he believes the ' hanging moon ' is likely to be the thing most people remember			0
supermoon over @entity70 : for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists , low - hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees , buildings and other foreground objects			0
a silhouetted airplane flies past a ' super moon ' over @entity70 on june 23 , 2013			0
' the ‘ @entity84 ’ is probably what will make people remember this coming set of @entity26 , more than the actual view of the @entity43 itself , ' he said			2
the illusion occurs when the @entity43 is near the horizon			2
for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists , low - hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees , buildings and other foreground objects			0
when the @entity43 illusion amplifies a perigee @entity43 , the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed			1
' i guarantee that some folks will think it 's the biggest moon they 've ever seen if they catch it rising over a distant horizon , because the media will have told them to pay attention to this particular one , ' says @entity54			0
' there 's a part of me that wishes that this ' @entity106 ' moniker would just dry up and blow away , like the ' @entity26 ' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse , because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis - information , ' admits @entity54			0
' however , if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy , then it 's a good thing			0

july 12th , august 10th , and sept. 9th will all be supermoons
full moons that occur on the perigee side of the @entity43 's orbit seem extra big and bright
