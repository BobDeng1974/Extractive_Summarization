by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:52 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 04:38 est , 30 march 2012 row : @entity4 and @entity5 have both rejected @entity7 's body , leaving a dilemma as to where he will be buried @entity10 gunman @entity7 has today been buried outside the @entity12 city of @entity4			1
a police helicopter buzzed overhead and around 100 policemen stood guard as the serial killer was laid to rest in the @entity18 cemetery			1
according to reports , his body was accompanied by around 15 men whose identities were unknown , but were said to be unrelated to the @entity23			2
' nobody from the family is there , not the mother , not the brothers , not the sisters , ' @entity24 of the @entity25 of @entity12 , who helped organise the burial , told @entity33			2
one of the mourners told the paper : ' we came because he has the right to be buried and accompanied by his friends like anyone else , even if some people say he is a criminal			0
' the funeral comes despite @entity4 's mayor @entity43 saying it would be ' inappropriate ' to lay @entity7 to rest in the city where he mercilessly gunned down four @entity45 and three soldiers in a two - week long terror campaign			1
the government of his home country of @entity5 , where today 's burial had been scheduled to take place , also banned him from being laid to rest there over ' security concerns '			0
and to further compound matters , @entity12 president @entity56 confusingly told television reporters the 23 - year - old should be allowed to be buried in the country where he committed his crimes			0
the row came as @entity12 police today said they were urgently seeking a ' third man ' who may have helped @entity7 murder his seven victims			1
his brother , @entity67 , was charged on sunday in connection with the terrorist crimes which took place across the south west of the country this month			0
and , during hours of interrogation , he has admitted that another man was involved – a claim which is being backed up by growing evidence			2
battle : @entity12 president @entity56 ( centre ) says @entity7 can be buried in the country , while @entity4 's mayor @entity43 ( right ) said it would be inappropriate for him to laid to rest in the city @entity67 , 29 , said that the man was in a car with the two brothers when they bought the @entity86 scooter used by @entity7 to travel to and from the murder scenes			1
‘ he has not told us the name of the man , ’ said a judicial source			2
‘ but he is actively being sought as a matter of urgency ’			0
intriguingly , investigators have now discovered a stolen white @entity95 containing parts of the motorbike and the crash helmet used @entity7			1
the car was found abandoned some 80 miles from the council house in @entity4 where @entity7 was shot dead by special forces police a week ago			1
arrested : @entity67 , the older brother of suspected gunman @entity102 , has indicated a third man could have been involved if a third man is indeed still on the loose , it raises the terrifying possibility that he could still be an active terrorist preparing to strike again			2
@entity7 , who claimed to have links to @entity10 , was killed after a 32 - hour siege			1
video footage shot by @entity7 shows him killing three @entity12 soldiers and four people at a @entity45 school			1
it is currently in the hands of the @entity116 tv channel , but they have agreed not to broadcast it following complaints by the @entity12 government			0
tragedy : rabbi @entity122 ( left ) and his sons @entity124 , 5 , and @entity125 , 4 , were gunned down			0
@entity126 , daughter of the school 's headteacher , was also killed it also comes as @entity12 has barred a group of @entity25 clerics , including one of the most prominent voices in @entity134 , from entering the country to attend a conference			0
@entity12 's foreign ministry said today the clerics were invited by the @entity138 to speak next month at a congress near @entity140			0
one of those barred , the @entity142 - born @entity141 , says he refuses to come to @entity12			0
tensions are high in @entity12 after @entity7 murders			1
the foreign ministry said in a statement that ' these people call for hatred and violence and seriously violate the principles of the @entity152 , and in the current context , seriously risk disrupting public order			0

police now *hunting* third man who may have helped @entity7
