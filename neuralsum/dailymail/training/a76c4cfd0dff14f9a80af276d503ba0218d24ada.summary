@entity0 , or forest giraffe , and the @entity3 white - winged flufftail – one of @entity6 ’s rarest birds – are now on the brink of extinction , according to the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
the two animals are the latest additions to its @entity12 , which now runs to a shocking 21,286 species			1
however , there is good news			1
two species of albatross , the leatherback turtle and the island fox native to @entity22 ’s @entity21 are showing signs of recovery			1
endangered : the okapi is a close relative of the giraffe and is revered in @entity29 as a national symbol the update highlights serious declines in the population of the okapi ( okapia johnstoni ) , a close relative of the giraffe , unique to the rainforests of the @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
the species is now endangered , only one step away from the highest risk of extinction , with numbers dwindling across its range			1
poaching and habitat loss , as well as the presence of rebels , elephant poachers and illegal miners , are the principal threats to its survival			1
‘ the okapi is revered in @entity29 as a national symbol – it even features on the @entity29 franc banknotes , ’ says dr @entity54 co-chair of the @entity55 and @entity56 and manager of @entity59 ’s range - wide okapi conservation project			1
threatened : the extremely rare white - winged flufftail could become extinct unless measures are taken to protect it ‘ sadly , @entity29 has been caught up in civil conflict and ravaged by poverty for nearly two decades , leading to widespread degradation of okapi habitat and hunting for its meat and skin			1
supporting government efforts to tackle the civil conflict and extreme poverty in the region are critical to securing its survival			1
’ according to the update , almost 200 species of bird are now classed as critically endangered , facing the highest risk of extinction			2
the white - winged flufftail ( sarothrura ayresi ) , a small , secretive bird which occurs in @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity6 , is the latest species to join this category			1
destruction and degradation of its habitat , including wetland drainage , conversion for agriculture , water abstraction , overgrazing by livestock and cutting of marsh vegetation , have driven it to this precarious state			2
urgent action is now needed to better understand the species ’ ecology and to address these threats , the @entity9 said			2
population increase : numbers of @entity109 have risen although the global population of the leatherback turtle ( dermochelys coriacea ) - the largest of all living turtles – has improved , the species continues to face serious threats at a subpopulation level			2
leatherbacks are a single species , globally comprising seven biologically and geographically distinct subpopulations			2
the @entity120 subpopulation is abundant and increasing thanks to successful conservation initiatives in the region			0
in contrast , the @entity125 subpopulation , which nests along the @entity126 of the @entity127 , and the @entity129 subpopulation , found in @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133 , are both in severe decline due to extensive egg harvest and incidental capture in fishing gear			0
targeted conservation efforts are needed to prevent their collapse			0
the @entity12 update also brings good news for some of the species assessed			0
two species of albatross - one of the most threatened of the planet ’s bird families – are now at a lower risk of extinction due to increases in their populations			0
the black - browed albatross ( thalassarche melanophrys ) has moved from endangered to near - threatened and the black - footed albatross ( phoebastria nigripes ) has moved from vulnerable to near - threatened			0
by - catch in fisheries is the main threat to these species			0
the island fox ( urocyon littoralis ) , previously critically endangered , has also improved in status and is now listed as near - threatened			0
hunted : @entity162 numbers declined partly as a result of being on the menu for non-native @entity165 found on six of the @entity167 off the coast of southern @entity22 , four island fox subspecies suffered catastrophic declines in the mid 1990s mainly due to disease and predation by non-native species , such as the golden eagle			0
all four subspecies have now recovered or are approaching recovery			0
this is mainly due to successful conservation work of @entity9 member the @entity180 @entity179 , which included captive breeding , reintroduction , vaccination against canine diseases and relocation of golden eagles			0
‘ this @entity12 update shows some fantastic conservation successes , which we must learn from , for future conservation efforts , ’ says @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 .			0

the okapi is revered in @entity29 and even features on banknotes
the @entity198 is one of @entity6 *'s* rarest birds
