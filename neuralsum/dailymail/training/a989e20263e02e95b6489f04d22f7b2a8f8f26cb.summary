the 66 - year - old lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated at @entity3 in april 2007			1
the @entity21 trust was prosecuted as an organisation , meaning that individual nurses , doctors and managers will not face jail for their failings			1

hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at @entity38 between 2005 and 2009 , and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered inhumane abuse			0
