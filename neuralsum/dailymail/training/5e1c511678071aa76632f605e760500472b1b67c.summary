first came the ' thigh gap ' trend , which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above the knees , gained momentum			1
then came the ' bikini bridge ' , described as ' when bikini bottoms are suspended between the two hip bones , causing a space between the bikini and the lower abdomen			1
' but with a new year , comes a new body part to hate - and fix			1
make way for the ' mon pubis ' , which refers to the mound of flesh on the pubic bone			1
the ' mon pubis ' , which refers to the mound of flesh on the pubic bone is being hailed as the latest body part to feel insecure about writing in the @entity25 , @entity24 explains : ' this year , the hot new body part is the formerly unnoticed span of flesh between the top of one 's panties and the labia majora , currently displayed on the cover of the @entity34 by the model @entity36			1
' @entity37 ! another thing to hate about ourselves			2
' the hashtag # @entity41 is already starting to do the rounds on @entity43 and there are plenty of forums dedicated to women who can air their insecurities about the body part			2
there 's even a cosmetic surgery procedure to fix it			1
@entity52 , also called @entity53 is a surgical procedure used to reduce and tighten the mons pubis			1
@entity56 is a fan of posting bikini shots when she hits the beach according to @entity61 , the area in question often becomes overly large with weight gain , childbirth or normal ageing			1
the treatment apparently reduces the sagging skin and tightens remaining muscle and tissue to create an improved appearance			2
celebrity skincare guru @entity70 , who runs skincare line nurse @entity71 , uses non-invasive ways to create a monsplasty effect including using infrared thermal energy - @entity75			2
@entity71 says the treatment uses focused radio ‐ frequency energy to ' strengthen collagen in your skin for a smooth , sleek look that can help you feel years younger '			2
in 2014 , the ' thigh gap ' trend , which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above the knees , gained momentum , with girls citing @entity90 as their inspiration speaking about the treatment , dr. @entity93 ( @entity92			0
) , of ‘ @entity95 ’ , said : ' @entity52 is a posh word for the removal of suprapubic fat			1
not to be confused with lower abbdominoplasty or tummy tuck , it can also occur in men and women who have been overweight and have lost a considerable amount of weight			0
' women seek it because they are on the eternal quest for perfection			0
with women being constantly bombarded with images in the media of perfect bodies and the current trend of designer abs , abs have never been more visible and more revered			0
' you can treat this area with radio frequency assisted lipo suction , which also tightens everything up preventing post-operative loose skin and minimises scarring			1
cases resulting from significant weight changes might need surgical correction under general anaesthesia involving the removal of excessive skin ' it is a walk - in - walk - out treatment with negligible downtime requiring the wearing of compression pants for six weeks			1
the cost would be approximately £ 1485			0
more serious cases need hospital admission and general anaesthesia and therefore the costs are considerably higher with scars healing over a period of ten days			0
; dr @entity137 says it is becoming very fashionable and popular at his clinic in the @entity140 where women are spending a lot of time on the beach			0
the latest body insecurity comes after the ' bikini bridge ' became a social media trend last year			0
there were even facetious comments posted promoting the ' benefits ' of possessing a ' bikini bridge ' such as ' fitting an @entity152 into your bikini bridge ' and ' getting a smoother tan line from your bikini bridge '			0
speaking to @entity159 at the time , body image and wellbeing expert @entity157 said : ' the bikini bridge is just another example of horrendous thinspiration that encourages young women to develop poor body image and self - esteem			0
' images like this used to be constrained to pro-anorexia websites - which are themselves dangerous , damaging communities for young men and women to encourage disordered eating behaviours			0
' @entity172 or otherwise , we need to learn that bodies are beautiful in all shapes and sizes - and encouraging young women to strive towards something like this is an unhealthy result of a body shaming culture			0
