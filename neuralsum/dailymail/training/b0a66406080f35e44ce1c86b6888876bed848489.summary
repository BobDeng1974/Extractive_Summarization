like any professional secret service agent , @entity0 seems to have bounced straight back after sustaining some injuries on the job			1
the brave @entity4 was one of two k - 9 's that took down @entity7 intruder @entity6 , 23 , who scaled the north fence and sprinted across the lawn on wednesday night in a bid to reach the executive mansion , where president @entity12 and the first family were at the time			1
@entity0 and fellow dog @entity15 , who can both sprint 25 miles per hour and have a bite that applies hundreds of pounds of pressure per square inch , quickly took down the @entity22 man , who suffers from mental problems and was arrested two months earlier for another @entity7 security breach			1
@entity6 tried to fight off the police dogs , kicking @entity0 in the snout and slamming @entity15 to the ground before punching him repeatedly			1

his father , @entity147 , said in a telephone interview that his son has been experiencing mental health problems for over a year , but he refused the help the family tried to get for him			0

' he said at one point his son took down a mirror in the bathroom and cut into the wall , trying to find a camera			0

rep. @entity203 , @entity204 , who has been leading congressional investigations into the @entity52 , commended the swift response wednesday night			1
