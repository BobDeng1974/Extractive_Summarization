despite turning @entity2 down on at least two occasions , @entity1 captain @entity0 has scored as many goals for the them as he has against them			1
as the former @entity8 captain prepares to pack his bags and head for @entity10 , an astonishing stat has emerged : @entity0 has played @entity2 39 times in his @entity1 career , but has managed just one goal against them			2
it came in the @entity17 in 2005 , when a 25 - year - old @entity0 , fresh from lifting a @entity19 trophy five months earlier , netted to level the match at 1 - 1			0
@entity0 has played against @entity2 39 times in his @entity1 career , but has only scored one goal @entity0 led @entity1 to the @entity23 semi-final this season , but they were knocked out on tuesday @entity25 had put @entity27 's side 1 - 0 up from the penalty spot before @entity0 's leveller , but even his one goal against them did not end in success as @entity33 , @entity34 and substitute @entity35 made it a day to forget for @entity1 as they crashed 4 - 1			1
the previous february , @entity0 had scored a goal for @entity2 in the @entity23 final in @entity39			1
after @entity45 's early strike , the captain 's unfortunate deflection from a @entity43 free - kick saw him on the scoresheet for all the wrong reasons , and his day was made worse by @entity2 's eventual extra-time win			0
@entity0 scored an own goal against @entity2 in the @entity23 final at @entity39 in february 2005 the @entity1 captain diverted a @entity43 free - kick into his own net as @entity2 won the match 3 - 2 no goals against the @entity56 in the following decade have resulted in a rather unfortunate record that is likely to stay with @entity0 for the rest of his career			1
tuesday night saw him take to the field against @entity2 for the 39th time , but he was unable to stop an extra-time winner from @entity63 , ending his hopes of lifting the @entity23 at @entity65 in march			2
now , the @entity66 represents @entity0 's final chance to lift a trophy in @entity1 colours			2
the @entity70 travel to @entity71 next wednesday , where a tie against @entity73 awaits in the fifth round if they come through			0
@entity2 manager @entity27 ( left ) consoles @entity0 after the @entity23 final in 2005 @entity0 ( second left ) celebrates his only goal against @entity2 - five months after his @entity23 own goal he does , though , have one final chance to score against @entity27 's side			1
@entity1 travel to @entity80 on may 9 , in what is set to be @entity0 's third - to - last @entity17 game for the club			0
with the title out of @entity1 's grasp , the match will potentially have a bearing on whether @entity88 will experience @entity19 football again next season			0
if not that , then it is simply a chance for @entity0 to improve his poor record .			0
