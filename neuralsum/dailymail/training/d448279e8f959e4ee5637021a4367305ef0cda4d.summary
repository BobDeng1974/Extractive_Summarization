one modest lump can fetch a small fortune			2
a large piece can turn its finder into a millionaire			2
it ’s the most valuable organic substance known to man — and you can find it from nothing more strenuous than a walk on the beach			1
this week , @entity11 was strolling on @entity12 with his dog when he spotted something odd : a fatty , smelly lump			2
he thought little more of it until he got home and decided to act on a hunch			2
@entity11 found a lump of rare whale vomit or ' ambergris ' on @entity24 beach when he was walking his dog he googled ‘ ambergris ’ and hit the jackpot			1
‘ there ’s gold out there on the beach ! ’ he proclaimed on @entity27 yesterday			1
‘ floating gold ! ’ @entity11 has already been offered £ 43,000 for his find			2
last year , eight - year - old @entity34 schoolboy @entity33 found a similar deposit near @entity36 , said to be worth £ 40,000			2
but just what is this weird substance that has made them rich ? the truth is even stranger than you might think — and takes us from the deepest ocean to the glamour of fashion , and from the stuff produced in the belly of the biggest predator that ever lived to the most delectable fragrance human beings have devised			2
that predator is the sperm whale : the monumental leviathan and real - life model for @entity56			1
sperm whales suffer under many misapprehensions and superlatives			1
it is they — not polar bears , as a recent @entity64 documentary insisted — who are the greatest predator			2
they are bigger even than any carnivorous dinosaur			0
they also possess the largest brain of any animal ( quite what they do with it is another matter )			0
@entity11 's dog @entity74 dug up the smelly substance which turned out to be whale dung and as mr @entity11 ’s find proves , these incredible animals also excrete ( rather than vomit , as most media coverage would have you believe ) , the world ’s most valuable dung — since that is what ambergris is			1
it is a kind of cholesterol that forms around the by - product of a sperm whale ’s main food source , squid — the hard beaks of which occasionally get caught in the animal ’s lower gut			1
hunted or stranded whales that have been cut open have been found with tens of thousands of such beaks , which are shiny black snapping mechanisms like parrot ’s beaks and composed of keratin , like human fingernails			1
as they snag in the whale ’s intestines , the sticky , fatty ‘ cholesterol ’ forms around them , like pearls forming around pieces of grit in oysters			1
some lumps of ambergris may contain many squid beaks			1
the biological reason for this may be to protect the whale ’s gut from ulcers			1
but it seems to happen in just one in 100 whales — one per cent of the population			1
there are around 360,000 sperm whales in the world , so that ’s quite a lot of ambergris floating about			1
the coalescing lump is expelled as dung			1
probably with relief : sperm whale poo is usally a runny red cloud in the water ( and rather odiferous in its own way , as i can attest , having been next to a young whale when it decided to discharge in my direction )			1
lighter than water , the ambergris floats and matures in the sea , turning from a sticky brown mass to a grey , waxy , shiny blob			0
hence its name from the @entity148 for ‘ grey amber ’ , after the golden , fossilised resin that is often found on the @entity152 ’s shores			1
for centuries ambergris has been imbued with wonderful properties			0
the ancient @entity155 called it ‘ dragon ’s spittle fragrance ’ and used it to spice their wine , believing it to be an aphrodisiac			1
sperm whales excrete the world 's most valuable dung , known as ambergis sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung has been used as an aphrodisiac in the @entity172 , it was burned as incense and as a preventative against plague			1
in @entity178 ’s @entity177 , @entity176 tempts @entity179 with ‘ @entity180 steamed ’			1
aristocrats of the @entity182 wore it moulded , dried and decorated as jewellery			0
@entity185 used to eat it with his eggs , rather in the way an epicure might now shave truffle over an omelette			0
sailors , with readier access to the stuff , had a more prosaic use for it : they employed it as a laxative			0
when researching my book on whales , i was made privy to the secret formula for the sacred oil used to anoint @entity204 monarchs in the coronation ceremony			1
in the private library set high in the upper storey of @entity208 , i was shown a recipe handed down over the centuries : @entity211 in @entity213 1 @entity212			0
sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung can be used as an aphrodisiac along with oils of jasmine , rose and cinnamon , @entity217 is listed as well as the exact amount required			1
but queen @entity222 objected to the smell so much that she washed it off immediately on her return from the @entity208			0
it was in the @entity228 archipelago of the @entity229 — where i had my own close encounters with the magnificent sperm whales — that i got to smell ambergris			1
there , dr @entity233 , a @entity204 scientist working on the island of @entity235 , handed me a small plastic box			1
when i opened it , the smell hit me			0
but inside was what looked like just a lump of mud			1
the aroma is almost indescribable — peaty , earthy , with undertones of dung , but incredibly powerful and elusive at the same time , with a lingering after - smell i can only compare to pure patchouli , the oil much favoured by hippies in the @entity250			1
it stayed on my fingers for three days , and a smear of it still scents my notebook			0
@entity256 , who devoted a whole chapter to it in @entity56 , wrote : ‘ who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a whale ! yet so it is			1
’ and indeed the quality of scent is why ambergris is highly prized — although not the only reason			0
it is also valued by the perfume industry for its extraordinary ability to capture other , more fugitive scents			0
it is the perfect fixative , for which no synthetic substitute has been found , and it ensures that perfumes retain their smell			1
modern chemical analysis shows the active element is ambrien , a crystalline , fatty cholesterol that slows the evaporation of volatile oils			2
molecular chemistry , as sophisticated as it is , still can not replicate ambrien ’s complexity			2
that explains the secretive trade in this strange substance — and the inflated sums paid for good , pure samples			0
the beach that 's paved with gold : @entity24 bay was where @entity11 found a valuable lump of whale dung the large lump of whale dung was found washed up at @entity12 in @entity298 @entity299 like that found on @entity24 beach is valued at around £ 800/lb in 1891 , fisherman @entity302 actually climbed into the belly of a dead whale in @entity305 — like a latter - day @entity306 — to dig out a boulder - sized piece of ambergris			1
it weighed 162 lb , 11 oz , and fetched him £ 11,000			0
that ’s more than half - a - million pounds in today ’s money			2
more recently , a huge lump was found in south - western @entity313 that was worth £ 100,000			0
today , a large , 30kg lump can keep a perfume house supplied for 20 years , at a cost to them of around £ 500,000			0
but the quality varies greatly , hence the fluidity of its price			0
@entity321 sells at an average of around £ 800 per pound on the international market — although the best pieces can fetch much more			0
the smooth , white boulders demanded by @entity326 and @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 command the highest prices			1
the lucky finders of these elusive specimens can name their price			0
even now there are men living on remote beaches who dedicate their lives to looking for ambergris			0
@entity299 is used in perfumes such as @entity341 5 @entity343 molecular biologist @entity342 set out to trace the sometimes dark and even sinister trail of ambergris in his compelling book @entity347			2
he found piratical exponents of the art of finding it on far - flung @entity351 , a @entity353 possession in the @entity354			0
his inquiries there were met with stone walls of silence — and even vague threats of violence			0
no one wanted to give away their secrets			0
one trader made it clear to @entity342 that the ambergris he supplied formed the basis for such famous scents as @entity341 and @entity370 ’s @entity369			2
@entity371 ’s of @entity372 , one of the world ’s oldest perfumers , has been making whale - infused perfumes for centuries			1
one was worn by @entity379 in the 19th century			0
more recently , another was made especially for @entity383 - born @entity382 star @entity381			0
having smelt ambergris myself , i can now identify it in perfumes			2
sometimes i ’ll walk into a party and immediately know someone is wearing it			0
when you read that a perfume has ‘ amber undertones ’ , you may be sure it owes them to ambergris			0
truly , this is an amazing journey			0
a substance born in the guts of an animal that spends most of its time in the deepest seas ends up on the counter of your local department store			0
so check your own perfume			0
you may be wearing the smell of whale poo today .			2

cholesterol forms on squid remnants inside sperm whales before excretion
whale dung , known as ambergis , is used in @entity327 and @entity329 perfumes
