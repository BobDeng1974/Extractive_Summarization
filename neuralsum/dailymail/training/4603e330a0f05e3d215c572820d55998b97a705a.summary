why @entity0 vs @entity1 is a victory for @entity3 , no matter what the result and my five things to look forward to most this summer the @entity9 final is the pinnacle of club football , a game that defines reputations and creates legends			0
for @entity15 , @entity16 ’s manager , saturday night 's collision with @entity18 in @entity19 presents him with an opportunity to put the gloss on an extraordinary season and complete what could be the greatest managerial achievement of all time			1
but this is all about context and what @entity15 has achieved since he became @entity16 manager on december 23 , 2011 is extraordinary			1
if he is to mastermind another victory over his neighbours , who are the richest club in the world , @entity15 would stand alone			2
@entity16 are a big club but they are not one of the giants of @entity64 , like @entity65 or @entity18 , @entity66 , the @entity68 clubs or @entity69 and @entity70 , where success at home and in @entity64 is demanded			1
there have been shock winners of the @entity9 before , such as @entity75 ( 1986 ) , @entity76 ( 1988 ) , @entity77 ( 1991 ) and @entity78 ( 2004 ) , but @entity16 would be unlike them because they are not the consistently dominant force in their own country that those clubs were			2
they are different , also , from @entity85 ’s @entity84 team , the last club outside @entity18 and @entity65 to win @entity30			1
@entity85 ’s work can not be knocked but @entity84 had not come from nowhere , as they had played in two consecutive @entity9 finals ( 2000 and 2001 ) under @entity89			0
think about the position @entity16 were in when @entity15 was appointed			1
they were 10th in @entity30 , but just four points off relegation , and were struggling after selling their prize assets @entity93 and @entity95 to ease mounting tax debts			0
under @entity15 , though , the rise has been relentless and rapid			2
he capped his first six months in charge by winning the @entity99 , as @entity16 beat @entity100 3 - 0 , having overseen a rise in @entity30 that took them to fifth place			2
made the most : @entity15 is on the cusp of greatness with @entity16 with such limited resources it can happen again : @entity78 were the shock winners in 2004 with a 3 - 0 win over @entity109 in @entity110 my stash : @entity48 relaxes with an array of trophies during his time at @entity70 start of it all : @entity117 lifting the @entity118 with @entity119 in 1983 the @entity120 , thanks to a 4 - 1 dismantling of @entity123 , and the @entity124 followed in 2012 - 13			1
but this is the campaign where @entity15 has really worked his magic , resulting in @entity16 ’s stunning triumph in @entity30 , their first domestic title since he was a player in 1995 - 96			1
do not underestimate the size of this feat. money is no object to @entity65 and @entity18 , while they have the world ’s two best players in @entity135 and @entity136 , yet @entity16 won on merit with 90 points			1
their performance to clinch the title in the @entity141 last saturday had class stamped over it			0
so now it is on to the final hurdle and the men @entity15 should be measured against are @entity147 , and @entity117 — during his time with @entity119			1
consecutive : @entity147 won the @entity9 twice with @entity150 in 1979 and 1980 man at the top : @entity51 won the trophy twice in his time at @entity65 , and is up there with the greats @entity117 ’s story at @entity119 is remarkable			1
he broke up the @entity159 ’s dominance of the @entity160 and led @entity119 , against the odds , to beat @entity18 in the 1983 @entity9 - @entity162 ’ cup final but , unlike @entity16 , they never made their mark in the @entity9			1
@entity147 and @entity150 , by contrast , certainly did			0
it is incredible to think , given where they are now , that @entity150 have won as many @entity170 cups as @entity171 , @entity78 and @entity172 — what they managed between 1977 and 1980 simply would n’t be possible in the modern era			0
from third place in the old @entity176 , @entity150 became champions of @entity3 before winning , then retaining , the @entity9			0
their success came during a golden era for @entity3 clubs in @entity64 , as aside from @entity70 ’s four victories , @entity182 also won it			0
double up : @entity50 has won the competition twice , with @entity78 and @entity68 minnows ? @entity16 are a selling club , letting @entity185 go to @entity109 last season limbering up : @entity32 ( left ) goes through some stretches as manager @entity15 walks beside him @entity150 added the @entity120 and two @entity189 in that glittering period , but @entity147 had financial help and was able to build on success — he famously made @entity194 , scorer of the winning goal in the 1979 @entity9 , @entity3 ’s first £ 1million player			1
@entity16 , by contrast , are a selling club , with debts last reported to be in excess of € 167million ( £ 135m )			1
@entity15 lost @entity185 last summer but he took that in his stride			0
results never suffered and he made @entity32 one of the most feared strikers in @entity64			0
he will find another gem once the @entity123 - bound @entity32 goes the way of @entity93 and @entity185			0
@entity15 will never be a favourite for the purists , given the style @entity16 favour , but it is impossible to argue given what they have done in the last two - and - a - half years			2
barking orders : @entity213 will be looking to guide @entity18 to the club 's tenth @entity9 victory @entity117 once said that a team embody their manager ’s character and that is absolutely true of @entity16 — not one player will ever shirk the relentless work ethic that @entity15 had during his own playing career			1
there will be questions for @entity15 to answer in the future , if and when he moves on , about whether he will be able to replicate his success at the @entity227 with a bigger club , as he would have to change his style to be more open and attractive			2
for the moment that can wait			0
there are so many strands to this @entity9 final , from whether @entity136 can fulfil his destiny to whether @entity213 can emulate @entity48 and become the second manager to win three @entity170 cups			0
should @entity15 land his first , however , the achievement would put him out on his own			2
thumbs up : @entity136 is expected to be fit for @entity18 's @entity9 final showdown			0

@entity15 could complete the greatest managerial achievement of all time
he is 90 minutes away from outstripping the likes of @entity47 , @entity50 , @entity48 and @entity51
@entity16 are a selling club , money is no object to @entity65 and @entity18
@entity15 should be measured against @entity147 and @entity117
