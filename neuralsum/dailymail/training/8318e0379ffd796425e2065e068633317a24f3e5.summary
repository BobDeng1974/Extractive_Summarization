by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is emerging as a genuine contender to start for @entity4 at the @entity5 after his bravura display against @entity7 , but @entity8 insists he should not be in @entity9 this summer at all			1
the former @entity4 under 21 boss claims that @entity11 is harming @entity4 's long - term chances of success by picking young players such as @entity2 and @entity15 and leaving them on the bench , rather than handing them guaranteed game time in international age - group football			1
the 20 - year - old @entity20 playmaker showed off his supreme natural talent during the 2 - 2 draw against the @entity23 in @entity24 on wednesday , capping a sparky performance by setting up @entity26 for @entity4 's second goal with a cheeky nutmeg , powerful run and cushioned pass to the striker			2
selecting young players like @entity2 ' means you consistently do n't win anything in the underage groups and that means you ca n't win anything at senior level , ' @entity8 told the @entity57			1
@entity8 pointed out that before the game against @entity59 had played less than 90 minutes for @entity4 this season			0
@entity15 thing : the @entity63 defender ( right ) was also handed a chance to shine against @entity7 lionheart : @entity8 is a former @entity4 defender who has also managed the @entity66 ' does that mean he 's had great experience sitting in the stands or does it mean that he 's missed six or seven under 21 qualifiers and the experience of international football ? i know where i 'd have left him , ' said @entity8			2
there is a growing clamour for @entity11 to select @entity4 's rising stars over the likes of @entity32 for the opening game against @entity79 in @entity80 on june 14			2
to @entity2 's advocates @entity8 's comments could be seen as having a whiff about them of @entity86 's infamous assertion that ' you do n't win anything with kids ' before @entity91 's class of 92 went on to dominate @entity93 football			0
but @entity8 cited @entity94 and @entity95 as the models of success which @entity4 should follow			0
both countries won major international age - group tournaments before going on to @entity5 and @entity101 glory			0
@entity8 was also critical of @entity11 's selection of @entity15 , the 19 - year - old @entity63 left - back chosen for @entity9 over @entity103 , whose international career is now over after amassing 107 caps			1
' @entity15 has had a very good season but i personally would have taken @entity103 , ' he said .			0

@entity8 says @entity11 should leave young players in under 21 *squad*
@entity40 manager also thinks @entity15 should not be in @entity9
@entity2 is pressing for a starting place in @entity4 's @entity5 team
