a volcanic eruption caused by the millions of tons of lava resting below @entity4 would cover cities across the country with ash and shut down air travel and communications , a study has concluded			1
but it would not herald the end of the @entity12 as we know it , as previous reports have claimed			0
the @entity4 in @entity15 and @entity16 sits atop a huge reserve of molten rock that has lain dormant for more than 70,000 years			1
they said that cities as far as 1,000 miles away from the park would be covered in a layer of ash up to 10ft deep , killing off all wildlife and making up to two thirds of the country uninhabitable			1
however a new study by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) concluded that such an apocalyptic scenario would not come to pass			0
the scientists used the program called @entity41 to model the effects of a @entity4 ' super eruption ' and found that cities up to 300 miles from the park would be covered by up to three feet of ash , cities further afield in the @entity45 would be covered by a few inches and coastal cities such as @entity48 and @entity49 would get only a fraction of an inch			1
an eruption at @entity4 would create an ' umbrella cloud ' of ash which would expand evenly in all directions driven by the force of the seismic event			1
dormant : the last volcanic eruption at @entity4 was 70,000 years ago “ in essence , the eruption makes its own winds that can overcome the prevailing westerlies , which normally dominate weather patterns in the @entity12 , ” @entity58 , the lead author of the new paper , said in a press release			2
even these smaller levels of ash would be a disaster for the @entity12			0
the @entity22 study says that electronic communication and air travel throughout the country would be shut down by an eruption			1
a huge cloud of ash thousands of miles across would also likely cause a year - long winter , say the study authors			1
the 1815 eruption of @entity79 in the @entity80 produced an ash cloud tens of miles across caused ' a year without a summer ' across the globe with snowfall in the @entity85 in june			0
areas covered in feet of ash would see buildings at risk of collapse and sewer and water lines blocked , and winds would form large dunes of ash that would cover roads and buildings			0
farming in the @entity45 would be devastated by the cloud of ash , and highways across the country would become slippy and treacherous			2
the @entity4 volcano has had three super eruptions - which produce more than 240 cubic miles of ash ' in the past			2
one was 2.1 million years ago , another 1.3 million years ago and a third 640,000 years ago			0
@entity107 from these eruptions has been found across the @entity12 on the east and west coasts			0
the last volcanic activity at @entity4 was 70,000 years ago which produced a lava flow in the south of the park .			0

an eruption of the millions of tons of molten rock under @entity4 would dump three feet of ash on @entity16 , inches on the @entity45 and fractions of inches on the coasts
@entity107 would shut down air travel and communications but would not make the country uninhabitable
eruption would likely herald a year - long winter
