by @entity0 news today that @entity2 cut her hair short because it was damaged by a @entity5 - style blowdry has not come as much surprise to industry experts			1
the controversial treatment , which uses a combination of formaldehyde and keratin to keep locks straight for up to three months , is considered the answer to a frizzy - haired girl 's prayers			1
but top @entity17 hairstylist @entity16 , who counts @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 among his clients , warns that one should proceed with caution if considering it			0
proceed with caution : top hairstylist @entity16 would n't recommend a @entity5 blowdry to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment cautionary tale : @entity2 was forced to cut her hair short ( right ) after damage from a @entity5 blowdry ' i think the treatment on its own is generally effective , but you have to make sure the condition of the hair is right for it , ' he told @entity40			1
' i usually would n’t recommend it to a client who is constantly coloring her hair because the hair might not be strong enough to bear the intensity of the treatment			1
i think the key is testing a small part of the hair first , before doing the whole head			2
' for celebrity make - up artist and hair stylist @entity49 , who works with @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , the @entity5 blowdry is more trouble than it is worth - indeed she was not impressed by her own experience of it			1
the @entity5 blowdry began in @entity5 in 2005 and usually uses a solution containing formaldehyde to straighten hair			1
the treatment involves washing the hair with a special shampoo that opens up the hair cuticles in preparation for the straightening solution which is applied , combed through , then left on the hair for 30 minutes			1
next , straighteners are applied to ‘ lock - in ’ the formula and set the blowdry			0
combining heat and formaldehyde prevents hair from curling , creating a long - term straightening effect			1
but when heated , formaldehyde emits a vapor which can cause symptoms including difficulty breathing and nosebleeds			0
formaldehyde has also been linked to a raised risk of cancer			0
there is additional concern that if formaldehyde comes into direct contact with the scalp it can penetrate the hair follicle and permanently damage cells responsible for hair growth			1
the result would be that when hairs fall out , new ones will not grow in their place			0
' not all @entity5 treatments are created equal , ' she said			2
' many have chemicals which can eventually damage hair so i 'm not surprised @entity101 doing the chop			0
' i personally have naturally bushy hair and had the treatment done one summer but i found it left my bouncy locks a little flat , ' she admitted			1
' i would have been better off just spending extra time using straighteners or just going with the curly flow of my natural texture			0
' ms @entity49 added that the maintenance was a frustrating extra expense too - especially given that the treatment itself can cost upwards of $ 300			0
those with keratin - treated hair must invest in sulphate - free shampoo in order to maintain it			2
' there are so many amazing hair products and tools on the market that i find this one beauty treatment that you can pass on , ' she concluded			2
ms @entity2 had her hair cut last week by @entity127 - her longtime hairstylist who gave her the ' @entity128 in the @entity129			2
' it was n’t for a role			0
my hair went through a phase , ' she admitted to @entity135 @entity134			2
' i did this thing called a @entity5 and my hair did not react really well to it			1
' a study earlier this year from the @entity138 , found that formaldehyde concentrations in the air around hairstylists and customers exceeded limits set by the @entity145 @entity144 , the @entity145 @entity146 , and the @entity147 of @entity148			0
it is recommended that hairdressers use products containing no more than 0.1 per cent formaldehyde , but researchers found that the popular @entity154 contained 12per cent formaldehyde			0
study author @entity156 said that ' without proper engineering controls like local exhaust ventilation [ the product ] could expose hairdressers and their clients to formaldehyde at levels above the short - term occupational exposure limits			0

the *actress* admitted this week : ' i did this thing called a @entity5 and my hair did not react really well to it '
the controversial treatment uses a combination of formaldehyde and keratin to keep hair straight for up to three months
