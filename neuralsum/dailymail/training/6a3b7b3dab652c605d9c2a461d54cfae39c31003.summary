by @entity1 reporter published : 20:33 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 14 september 2013 a new book makes shocking new claims that ' coked - up ' members of the @entity6 ' 1981 - 1982 team fixed games for their drug dealer , who bet thousands of dollars on the team in the midst of their terrible season			1
@entity14 's new book , @entity15 : sports gambling , @entity17 and the @entity18 , cites @entity18 sources who said they investigated whether three members of the team - who were said to be ' heavy users of cocaine ' - were involved in a point - shaving scheme to benefit their supplier , who is identified only as ' one of the largest dealers on the @entity29			1
' according to @entity14 's @entity18 sources , the dealer was known as a degenerate sports gambler who typically bet $ 300 a game on @entity36 games			1
when it appeared he had his hooks in some of the @entity6 players - in roughly january of 1982 - the dealer began upping his bets to $ 10,000 , often betting against the @entity6 to win or cover the spread			1
cheaters : @entity14 's book @entity15 outlines an @entity18 investigation into whether @entity6 players shaved points to help their drug dealer by march of 1982 , the dealer had won six of the seven large bets he 'd made against the @entity6 - all while continuing to bet his regular $ 300 on games in which the @entity6 were not playing			1
' over ... the last two months , all three [ players ] have given ... tips on when to bet the @entity6 to lose			0
this has occurred seven times and six of the tips were good , ' according to @entity18 files citing two unnamed sources			2
' simultaneously , the @entity18 began to suspect that the three @entity6 players were ' betting against themselves , ' with one of the men owing a ' large ... gambling debt ' to a bookie with the @entity67 crime family			2
' so many people say it ’s impossible to fix a game because guys are paid so much money , ' @entity14 told the @entity73			0
' but you can see how easily they can get hooked on some drug , be gambling themselves and get in deep with a bookie			0
' addict : @entity80 is suspected of possibly being one of the players who cheated , a charge he denies banned : @entity80 was banned from the @entity36 for life in 1986 but now coaches a @entity86 team point - shaving in basketball involves a player intentionally playing bad to make the final score closer than it otherwise would be , which helps gamblers beat the spread and win the bet			1
at first , @entity18 agents did n't think the trio was actually shaving points , rather , ' extending a courtesy to their cocaine dealer regarding inside player information			1
' as the dealer continued to be successful , in about march of 1982 , @entity18 agents noted that a ' source now believes that the players are actively engaging in " shaving points " and possibly even betting against themselves			1
' ' source observed heavy betting by [ redacted ] toward the latter part of the season ... on the @entity6 to lose certain games			0
in each case , the @entity6 did lose , or failed to cover the point spread , ' the @entity18 file reads			2
the names of the players are redacted from the report , but one of those suspected of possibly being involved in the alleged point - shaving scheme is guard @entity80 , who was banned from the @entity36 for life in 1986 for violating the league 's drug policy three times			1
coach : some on the team attribute the poor performance to a lack of leadership from coach @entity126 @entity80 averaged 18 points a game , despite a rumored cocaine problem			1
when the team finished in last in the @entity131 - after going 33 - 49 in the regular season - @entity80 was quoted as saying ' the ship be sinking			2
' @entity80 - who now coaches the @entity133 in the @entity134 in @entity86 - denies that he was ever involved in a point - shaving scheme , telling the @entity73 ' hell no.			2
. we never did anything like that			0
' others blame the poor performance on the leadership of coach @entity126 , who players have said did n't do much to motivate his players			0
' at times the coach was a little lax , and he did n’t put enough pressure on those guys [ to play harder ] , ' said @entity147 , a @entity6 rookie during the season in question			0
' at certain times , when we needed to turn it up , it just was n’t there			0
' @entity14 , however , does n't buy it			0
' it was no coincidence , ' he said when asked about other possible explanations for the teams atrocious season .			0

the @entity18 looked into whether three members of the @entity162 's 1982 team helped shave points to help their cocaine dealer win bets
one of those suspected is former guard @entity80 , who was banned from the @entity36 for life after failing three drug tests
@entity80 denies that he is one of the players who allegedly helped shave points for the unidentified dealer
