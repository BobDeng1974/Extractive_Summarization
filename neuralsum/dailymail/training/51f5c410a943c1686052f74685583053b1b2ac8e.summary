the astonishing row between @entity2 ’s two best distance runners escalated on friday night with a series of explosive claims and counter-claims			1
@entity6 on friday reignited the dispute with @entity8 when he revealed what sparked their @entity11 row earlier this week , claiming the @entity13 silver medallist implied he should have won gold in @entity15 last year because the @entity17 - born @entity16 is not @entity2			1
but @entity8 , while admitting he had joked over a meal one night in @entity15 that he should have been crowned ‘ @entity13 champion ’ , responded by accusing @entity16 and his management team of employing ‘ snide ’ tactics to trash his reputation in a bid to repair the damage to their own			1
@entity6 spoke out about his @entity11 spat with @entity8 and said it was down to a comment made by his fellow distance runner that implied that he did not deserve gold at the @entity32 in 2014 @entity16 said : ' one comment he made , which i did n't really like , was to say that he should have won the gold ' @entity16 is in @entity37 preparing for an indoor two - mile record attempt at the @entity39 @entity16 and @entity40 , who finished one - two at the @entity32 , clashed on @entity11 @entity16 was forced to issue a public apology on friday - ahead of saturday ’s attempt to break the world indoor two - mile record in the @entity39 ’s @entity2 indoor grand prix - for the way he responded to a jibe from @entity40 on @entity11 on tuesday night			1
in branding @entity40 an ‘ embarrassment ’ who had not won anything ‘ decent ’ , the double @entity50 champion accepted he had offended the wider athletics community			1
‘ i ’d like to apologise to the public , ’ he said			2
then @entity16 , having consulted with his representatives before his media appearance , decided to reveal that he and @entity8 had ‘ history ’ dating back to the @entity32 that saw @entity16 win gold in the 10,000 and 5,000 metres , when @entity8 took a silver and bronze			1
‘ it happened in the @entity63 in @entity15 where he came second in the race i won , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ we were sitting down together and there were a number of staff and athletes there too			2
one comment he made , which i did n’t really like , was to say that he should have won the gold			2
‘ i was like , ‘ ‘ what , the gold should have been given to you ? ’ ’ and i was like , ‘ ‘ because he was the only @entity13 guy ? ’ ’ you ca n’t say something like that			2
i was just kind of biting my tongue at the time			2
’ the implication is that @entity8 was referring to the fact that he had been born in @entity17 but then moved to the @entity2 as a child			1
‘ i do n’t know what he meant , ’ he replied			2
‘ but at that point it hurt me			2
but to come out publicly and say something like that ( the @entity11 row ) ; that ’s why i reacted			1
i should never come out publicly and say some things			2
but we have to move on			2
’ a spokesperson for @entity99 said : ‘ we will be talking to @entity8 about the comment he made and reminding him of his responsibilities as a @entity2 team member			1
’ but @entity8 responded with anger on friday night			1
‘ look , i did make a joke about being @entity13 champion but in the context of the conversation - which was very light - hearted - i honestly did n’t think i ’d caused offence , ’ he insisted			1
‘ if i did , then i apologise but i really feel this has been taken out of context to shift the focus back on me and i now feel i ’ve been really badly misrepresented			0
’ earlier , the 29 - year - old told @entity113 : ‘ i am really disappointed with what he ( @entity16 ) said			1
it ’s an outrageous misrepresentation of the chat we had at the @entity13			0
i do n’t discard him as @entity2 - it ’s complete lies			1
his management team have been very snide at making me out to being a bad guy here			0
‘ i ’ve known @entity6 for 12 years			1
we were n’t best of friends but we were pals			0
i was delighted when we finished first and second in the 10,000m and i celebrated with him			2
when i heard he said something in the press conference ( on friday ) i immediately tried to contact his management team to say i am sorry if anything i said did offend you , it was n’t meant like that			0
but no one has got back to me			0
he is trying to brand me something that i am not			0
@entity16 celebrates his victory over @entity40 for the men 's 10,000m @entity13 titles in @entity15 in august 2014 @entity8 said that the field running with @entity16 in his bid for an indoor world record in @entity37 was a joke the response ‘ @entity141 ’ from @entity16 offended many in athletics ‘ there ’s nothing more i ’d like right now than a two - way press conference when we can discuss what happened , because what he said is not what i said			1
he has played the cheap shot			0
he has played the card			0
i do n’t know what i can do			0
’ @entity16 had earlier responded over their midweek @entity11 spat			1
having seen a tweet from @entity40 suggesting that a weakened field for saturday ’s race amounted to a ‘ joke ’ , @entity16 accepts he over-reacted			1
‘ i should never have reacted that way and i do apologise , ’ he said			0
‘ when he comes out publicly and says something i ’m going to try and defend myself			0
but someone like me should never really have done something like that			0
‘ it ( criticism ) is difficult but you know if it ’s the normal public , you just have to deal with it and let your running do the talking			0
but with an athlete like him , one i ’ve been on the podium with , it was difficult to bite my tongue			0
i could n’t do it			0
my frustration just got the better of me , for sure			0
‘ i put my hand up			0
but @entity8 has a history of disrespecting athletes			1
he did it before , with @entity183			0
you know , me and @entity8			2
we ’re not best friends , we ’ll never be best friends			0
that ’s just how it is			0
’ @entity8 did not deny that he made the comments but said it was to carry on a joke around a table @entity8 apologised and while @entity16 did not reciprocate , he did concede that he had over-reacted @entity16 says that he and @entity40 will never be ' best friends ' but he regrets the way he reacted on @entity11			1

@entity8 and @entity6 engaged in an *argument* on @entity11 this week
@entity8 *labelled* the field against @entity16 last weekend in @entity37 ' a joke '
@entity16 called the runner who finished second to him in the @entity32 ' an embarrassment '
now @entity17 - born @entity16 claims @entity8 said he did n't deserve to win gold at the @entity32 ahead of him because @entity16 is not @entity2
@entity8 did not deny @entity16 's claims when asked on the subject
many in the wider athletics community found @entity16 's comments *arrogant*
