by @entity0 @entity1 have held talks with @entity3 to underline their desire to keep him well beyond this summer			1
the brilliant @entity6 striker is understood to have met @entity1 owner @entity7 in @entity8 last week			1
despite being hindered by niggling injuries , @entity3 has still scored 26 goals in 28 games this season to cement his reputation as one of the best forwards in the world			2
@entity18 striker : @entity1 are keen to keep @entity3 beyond this summer goal king : @entity3 celebrates one of his 26 goals for @entity1 this season , despite being hampered by injuries ( right ) that standing means he is continuing to attract interest from the likes of @entity27 who have wanted him at the @entity29 since he emerged on the @entity31 scene at neighbours @entity32			1
city realise a move back to sunnier climes and a @entity31 - speaking community is a potentially attractive proposition but they are determined to show he is valued as a pivotal part of their plans			2
he is expected to be fit to face @entity42 in the crucial @entity44 clash this weekend and the ultimate goal is for him to spearhead @entity1 's @entity47 challenge next season			2
hot shot : @entity3 scores against @entity50 in an @entity52 replay earlier this year losing a talent such as @entity3 would be extremely difficult to replace with only @entity42 's @entity54 considered in the same bracket at this stage			0
although chief executive @entity57 has already underlined to @entity58 at @entity27 that @entity3 is not for sale at any price , @entity7 wanted to ensure @entity3 understands just how much he is appreciated			1
@entity1 will continue to look at strengthening their support for him with @entity64 's @entity63 an option they are considering and talks ongoing for the likes of @entity68 and @entity69 at @entity70			0
meanwhile , the latest @entity1 player to interest the ever - busy @entity72 is midfielder @entity73			2
the @entity74 would like to arrange a loan deal but @entity1 would prefer a permanent deal			0
@entity32 will consider asking for @entity77 should @entity78 make @entity79 their @entity82 goalkeeper next season			1
@entity32 want @entity79 to accept a new deal at @entity78 as they believe it represents the best chance of him being loaned out to them again next season			1
however , @entity88 is understood to be seriously considering promoting the excellent @entity89 to his first team next season leaving @entity32 with the prospect of looking at alternatives			0
@entity77 will be one of them but they will also evaluate other keepers in @entity31 and @entity97 at @entity42			0
moving to @entity27 ? @entity32 are considering a move for @entity77 should @entity79 become @entity78 's no 1 @entity100 are favourites to sign @entity101 in the summer despite interest from other clubs			1
there is an expectation at @entity106 's that the talented crop of @entity109 players could break up this summer as @entity110 's and @entity112 's elite circle their young stars			2
striker @entity114 , who is to undergo a scan on his injured knee on monday , may yet end up staying for another season but @entity101 is widely tipped to leave once the right bid is made			2
@entity119 and @entity1 have watched @entity101 but @entity100 have made it clear they are keen on taking him to @entity121 as part of their summer rejig			1
spurs have already confirmed an interest in @entity127 but they would have to outbid all rivals for @entity78 to consider selling to them			0
@entity27 have joined the likes of @entity119 , @entity78 , @entity1 and @entity42 in admiring @entity109 's teenage left back @entity131 but they still seem more intent on signing @entity132 from @entity133 , who again remains on @entity119 's list			1
spur of the moment : @entity100 are favourites to sign @entity109 star @entity101 ( centre ) @entity138 is expected to secure a move to the @entity44 this summer			1
the @entity141 striker has scored 16 goals in 18 games for @entity144 this season and is once again attracting keen interest across @entity112 with his agent @entity147 sounding out potential clubs			2
the 26 - year - old was the @entity150 winner in @entity151 in 2012 and , although injury curtailed his following season , he has returned to form this year			0
however , @entity138 will be hoping most of the big @entity44 sides do n't get their main target this summer , that 's because he is emerging as a popular back - up			1
prolific : @entity138 ( right ) has scored 16 goals in 18 games for @entity144 this season @entity78 and @entity160 are among his admirers			1
they have monitored his scoring exploits over recent seasons but @entity144 's variable valuations ranging from £ 15m to £ 30m have put them off negotiations			0
this time round , @entity78 want two strikers and @entity138 is coming in at around no 5 on their list of preferences which is topped by @entity32 's @entity170			1
@entity160 consider him to be around fourth on their list while he is also being discussed at @entity172 and @entity173 but may prove too expensive for their budget			0
@entity175 have agreed a new three year deal with 18 - year - old winger @entity177			0
the @entity178 under - 20 international , has been linked with former manager @entity179 at @entity180 , and would have been out of contract in the summer			0
@entity177 has had two loan spells in @entity183 this season , with @entity185 and @entity186			0
wolves are continuing to show interest in @entity190 midfielder @entity189			0
the 20 - year - old @entity192 man has rediscovered his form under the tutelage of caretaker manager @entity195 and has turned in some dependable performances despite the club 's slide towards the foot of @entity200			0
@entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 have also been watching @entity189 this season but @entity187 will prove an exciting project as they seek to follow up promotion from @entity183 with an concerted attempt on replicating that in the @entity209 next season			0
newly - promoted @entity210 are ready to contest with the big boys for @entity214 prospect @entity212			1
the 20 - year - old , tipped to follow compatriots @entity3 and @entity217 to @entity112 , has a £ 7.5million buy - out clause but cash - strapped @entity219 are willing to accept around £ 6m with add - ons to ensure a sale this summer			1
@entity172 , @entity42 and @entity160 have all been made aware of the 5ft 8in forward , who has scored two in his last three games and has a dual @entity74 passport			0
however , @entity210 are also keen to speak to his representatives as they look to strengthen their squad in key areas early in the summer to prepare for their @entity44 return			2
@entity112 bound : @entity212 ( right ) is on the radar of @entity210 and some @entity44 big boys			1
