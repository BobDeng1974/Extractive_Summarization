by @entity0 carer : @entity2 looked after her friend @entity3 before she died in 2009 the carer of a @entity6 survivor has won her right to an inheritance following a court battle against a tv ' heir hunter ' who claimed she was a ' trespasser '			1
@entity2 looked after her friend @entity3 who had made @entity11 her home after fleeing @entity13 just before the start of the @entity15			1
mrs @entity3 died aged 89 believing she had no living relatives			2
her sister had died in a concentration camp			0
mrs @entity3 promised to leave her @entity20 flat to @entity21 in return for the years of care she had selflessly given her			1
however , she made no will and a legal wrangle ensued after professional genealogist , @entity28 - who has appeared on the @entity30 series , @entity25 - traced two distant cousins of mrs @entity3			1
during a hearing in @entity11 , the court heard mrs @entity3 had experienced the horror of fleeing from @entity13 and arrived in @entity11 in may 1939 , when she was just 19			1
she and her husband , @entity35 , lived together in their flat , in @entity38 , @entity39 , north @entity11 , for 48 years , until his death in 1994			1
the couple never had any children and her sister , who also tried to escape @entity13 but was captured , was dead			0
mrs @entity3 believed she had no blood relatives left alive			2
the court heard that despite her sizeable fortune , most of which was discovered in bank accounts and shares following her death , the widow lived a humble existence and often worried she would run out of money			2
she was also a hoarder and her obsession with keeping everything meant she still had the suitcases her sister had packed for her escape bid as well as her husband ’s wartime army uniform			0
miss @entity2 cared part - time for the widow since 2005 while also holding down two jobs and moved into her flat			1
mrs @entity3 died in december 2009			2
acting on behalf of mrs @entity3 ’s estate , mr @entity28 argued miss @entity2 was a ‘ trespasser ’ who should be ousted from the property and made to pay £ 50,000 for her years of rent - free occupation			1
however , a judge ruled mrs @entity3 did promise the flat to her carer and said miss @entity2 had ‘ done her best ’ to look after the widow in her final years			1
judge @entity73 awarded @entity21 £ 20,000 from the estate and dismissed mr @entity28 ’s financial claim against her			2
payout : miss @entity2 cared part - time for the widow from 2005 while also holding down two jobs but the judge also ruled that the ‘ value ’ of the free care provided by @entity21 was only £ 70,000 - not the £ 160,000 value of the flat - and said she would have to leave her home in december so it could go back to the estate			1
speaking after the case @entity21 said : ' i looked after her but we were n’t just friends , we were more like grandmother and granddaughter , we were very close			0
' she was an extremely intelligent woman and i have some lovely memories of our time together			0
she will always be in my heart			0
' the court heard that mrs @entity3 met miss @entity2 who had moved to the @entity93 from @entity94 in 2002 at her local supermarket where the younger woman worked			1
the 39 - year - old described the touching friendship they struck up after she began helping the pensioner by delivering her shopping			0
the two would regularly go to a hotel near her flat where the pensioner - a classically - trained pianist - would entertain guests by playing			0
miss @entity2 said : ' @entity3 loved music and she was an incredible pianist , she played by ear			1
she could play anything , things she heard on the radio , and she loved to play			0
' she had arthritis in her hands and she struggled with them , but when she played it was like she forgot all of her pain			0
' tv heir hunter @entity28 however , she also suffered from anxiety and had an ‘ obsessive ’ personality , which led to her hoarding vast amounts of clutter , leaving her home in a squalid state			2
miss @entity2 , who has a masters degree in computing , helped her to clear the flat and would also take her to hospital and doctors ’ appointments			2
the court heard that in may 2005 , following a two - month stay in hospital , mrs @entity3 phoned @entity21 and asked if she could come and collect her from hospital because she had no - one else			1
the widow was adamant she did not want any professional carers and asked her young friend if she would help her so she could stay in her own flat			0
miss @entity2 told the court : ' she said she was capable of doing things herself and she knew what she wanted - she was very strong - minded			2
' according to @entity21 , it was at this time that mrs @entity3 first said she wanted her to have the flat when she died			1
she said mrs @entity3 repeated the promise may more times			2
her barrister , @entity145 , said : ' @entity21 was the only person she knew who was young , female and willing to care for her			0
' he said while she continued working at the supermarket and had a cleaning job , she also provided daily care to mrs @entity152 from then onwards - with the level of care increasing as the pensioner ’s health deteriorated			0
miss @entity2 would cook and clean for her , bathe her , change her bedding and get her out of bed on a morning - which she could not do on her own - and continued to do so until mrs @entity3 went into a care home in april 2009			1
picture shows @entity3 and her husband , @entity35 , on their wedding day in 1950 talented : @entity3 entertaining guests at the @entity166 , in @entity20 , on the piano arguing that the pensioner ’s promise to her should be honoured , miss @entity2 told the court : ' the fact is she wanted to leave me the flat - what else should i have considered ; that was her wish			1
' there was a high level of trust in the relationship we had and she was a person who honoured her word , she never lied to me			0
' she said i should not worry about it , everything is going to be arranged for			0
' ' i am , in all the circumstances , satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to @entity21 on the day on which she was discharged from hospital ' judge @entity188 mr @entity28 denied she was entitled to the flat and argued she should have to pay rent for the time she had lived there			1
ruling in miss @entity2 ’s favour , judge @entity188 found mrs @entity3 did promise her the flat , but said the £ 160,000 property was ‘ disproportionate ’ for the part - time care she had provided			1
he concluded that , based on the level of care and the length of time it was given , she was entitled to £ 70,000			0
the judge said the time she had already spent living in the flat was worth about £ 50,000 and therefore the estate should pay the other £ 20,000			0
he also awarded @entity21 all of her legal costs out of the estate			0
the judge said : ' i am , in all the circumstances , satisfied that this promise was made by the deceased to @entity21 on the day on which she was discharged from hospital			2
@entity3 entertaining guests at the @entity166 in @entity20 , @entity11 where she also lived ' i am also satisfied there is a sufficient nexus between the promise made by the deceased and the activities carried out by @entity21 thereafter			1
' giving her six months before she has to leave the flat , he added : ' i am not going to force this lady out of this flat , this has been her home for some time and this is what the deceased asked should happen			0
' i have decided that she should get a sum of money instead of two more years in the property , but to force her out of her home under pressure strikes me as quite wrong - this is her home			0
