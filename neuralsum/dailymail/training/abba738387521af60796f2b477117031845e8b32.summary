by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 29 may 2013 overweight patients are switching doctors because they are uncomfortable with unwanted weight loss advice overweight patients are significantly more likely to engage in ' doctor shopping ' - regularly switching doctors - than normal - sized patients , according to a new study			1
off - putting weight loss advice and improperly sized medical equipment are thought to be the major reasons , say the researchers , from the @entity12 in @entity13			1
but constantly moving about means these patients are a staggering 85 per cent more likely to end up in @entity16 , they say			1
the study of more than 20,000 patients showed that the odds of doctor shopping increased by 19 per cent for overweight patients and 37 per cent for obese patients , compared with normal - weight patients			1
. four per cent of patients saw five or more primary care doctors over two years , a practice more likely in obese and overweight patients as well			2
@entity26 , an assistant professor in the division of general internal medicine at the @entity29 , said : ' if you are dissatisfied with your care or feel judged because of your weight , then you may be better served by finding a provider who can meet your needs			0
' but the worry , she adds , is that some patients may not find a doctor they feel comfortable and are then driven to keep searching for new ones			0
she continued : ' there ’s something going wrong in these doctor - patient relationships that make these switches so frequent for this group of people			2
' ' the real problem here is that the health of overweight and obese patients who doctor shop is being compromised			0
by switching doctors too regularly , overweight and obese patients are 85 per cent more likely to end up in @entity16 ' because they do not remain with their doctors for very long , they are ending up in the emergency room , likely for things that could have been taken care of in a primary care office			1
' ' if they feel judged or hear offhanded comments about their weight , if the blood pressure cuff wo n’t fit properly or they are afraid the examination table will not support their weight , it reinforces negative stereotypes obese patients encounter elsewhere			0
' ' we need to strive to create a safe , judgment - free environment where all patients can receive satisfying medical care			0
' the research is published in in the journal @entity75 .			0

' doctor shopping ' is significantly more common among the overweight
off - putting , unwanted weight loss advice and too *small* *furniture* to blame
those who regularly switch doctors 85 per cent more likely to end up in @entity16
