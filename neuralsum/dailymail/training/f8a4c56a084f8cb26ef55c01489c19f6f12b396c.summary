i had saturated myself with @entity2 and her life and i felt this enormous responsibility of playing this iconic woman			1

‘ but then i also knew the best roles come with a risk			2
in the end , i decided that i could n’t not do it			2
this was a story that had to be told – it ’s an important story – but it was definitely the hardest thing i ’ve ever done			2
it ’s as close as i ever want to get to a character			2

our sense of their relationship was that it was very spiritual and sensitive , as well as difficult , obviously			0
we are handling it very sensitively			0
’ @entity1 adds that her own approach involved a great deal of research , including meeting many of @entity2 ’s friends			1
‘ it meant i could pick up little details and make sure i was doing it right , ’ she says			0
‘ people were unanimous in their praise of her extraordinary sense of humour and her cheekiness			0

he had wonderful surgeon ’s hands and eyes and she was tremendously excited to be near someone who was doing good work			0
' however , in order to do that good work he could n’t possibly be in the eye of a media storm			0
‘ when you are doing 12 - hour - long heart operations you ca n’t come out of that and then have a her towards him meant they could n’t stay together			0
' i think that it was a relationship , which i ’m sure we ’ve all experienced , where you go on longer with it than rationally you should			0
‘ you kind of know it ’s not going to work and there are clear reasons why , but the heart overrules the head			0
’ @entity168 , who based his script on journalist @entity194 ’s book , @entity2 : her last love , and his own extensive research , believes there was a chance that , had she lived , @entity2 and @entity82 would have got back together			1
