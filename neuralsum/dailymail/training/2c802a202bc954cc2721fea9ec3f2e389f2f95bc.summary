president @entity0 is returning tuesday to the city where he says he first forged his ties to the @entity4 community to pitch his new executive actions on immigration , on a day when a suburb of @entity8 is recovering from massive overnight riots 300 miles away			1
the president 's decision to give an expected lengthy speech in the @entity13 after devoting just nine minutes monday night to calling for calm in @entity15 , @entity16 , will open him up to criticism that he 's both insensitive and politically tone deaf			1
he said monday night in response to a single question he took from a reporter at the @entity22 that no decision has been made about whether he will visit @entity15 personally			0
but his interest in barnstorming to generate interest in his immigration policy obsession comes as a new poll shows a large majority of likely @entity30 voters believe he 's wrong			1
the @entity53 poll released monday afternoon and lost in the overwhelming news coverage of the @entity15 riots found that 62 per cent oppose @entity0 's decision to grant legal amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants without approval from @entity47			1
just 26 per cent are in favor of @entity0 's plan			1
after years of claiming he could n't act unilaterally to enact immigration reform because of the @entity30 @entity64 's emphasis on a separation of executive and legislative powers , @entity0 declared last week that he had the legal authority to do so on a temporary basis			1
only 24 per cent of those who spoke to @entity53 's pollsters agree			1
fifty - seven per cent said he was right the first time , deciding that he not have the legal right to implement his plan			1
worse for the @entity22 , 55 per cent told @entity53 that @entity47 should challenge @entity0 's executive actions in court			1
the president spoke @entity13 community leaders , part of an ongoing effort to defend and promote his decision to bypass @entity47 and direct sweeping executive actions that could spare millions of immigrants illegally in the @entity30 from being deported			1
his plan also threatens to open the employment floodgates as those temporarily ' legal ' immigrants win eligibility for work authorization cards			2
@entity89 reviewed polling data that indicates @entity30 are even more upset about the prospect of losing jobs to illegal immigrants at a time when the overall @entity30 labor participation rate is its lowest since 1978			1
@entity0 said monday night that a presidential visit to @entity15 is still an open question			0
' let ’s take a look and see how things are going , ' the president said monday night at the @entity22			0
[ attorney general ] @entity102 has been there			0
we 've had a whole team from the @entity107 there , and i think that they have done some very good work			0
' @entity0 will speak in @entity13 at a center in the city 's predominantly @entity112 far northwest side , underscoring how his immigration measures would affect more than @entity4 immigrants			2
@entity13 has the largest population of @entity117 in the @entity30			0
under a series of measures @entity0 announced last week , nearly 5 million immigrants will be eligible to avoid deportation and sign up for work permits			1
the number who could benefit represents about 45 percent of the total number of immigrants who either entered the country illegally or have overstayed their visas			0
@entity50 have vowed to rein @entity0 in , but have not fallen behind any specific plan			2
@entity130 : @entity0 will dodge controversy by speaking 300 miles away from @entity15 rioters set police cars like this one ablaze on monday night after a grand jury declined to indict police officer @entity34 in the shooting death of 18 - year - old @entity36 @entity137 : the @entity15 protests came the @entity0 's doorstep last night as activists with pre-printed signs converged on the @entity22 shortly after the president delivered brief remarks @entity13 is @entity0 's hometown – he worked in the city as a community organizer in the 1980s – and its metropolitan area has the fifth largest latino population in the country			2
@entity0 is expected to highlight what the @entity22 says are the economic advantages of his executive decision and to counter @entity50 criticism that his measures exceed his authority			2
the @entity13 visit is his second trip out of @entity157 to draw attention to his actions since he announced them thursday			0
last friday , the president spoke in @entity162 , another city with a large @entity4 population			0
@entity0 has a mixed history in @entity13 over the question of immigration			2
he conceded in his 2006 book ' @entity168 ' that his experiences there led him to reflect on the meaning of citizenship and ' my sometimes conflicted feelings about all the changes that are taking place			0
' in 2006 , when he was a senator from @entity177 , he denied a request from about 30 @entity180 nationals living in @entity13 for a special piece of legislation that would protect them from deportation			0
the decision infuriated immigration activists in the city			0
but @entity0 has also backed an overhaul of immigration law , and while he initially angered advocacy groups by delaying his executive actions until after this month 's midterm elections , last week 's measures have generally been greeted with enthusiasm from immigration advocates and latino groups .			0

trip was *scheduled* before chaos took over *streets* of @entity8 suburb
but @entity0 risks being seen as tone deaf by pushing for an *unpopular* policy objective in the midst of a national *emergency*
@entity53 poll shows a massive majority of likely voters – 62 per cent – oppose his plan to give millions of illegal immigrants a temporary amnesty
@entity0 plan also *includes* work permits for millions not currently allowed to hold @entity30 jobs
only 24 per cent now say @entity0 has the legal authority to change immigration policy without agreement from @entity47
a 55 - per cent majority believe *federal* *lawmakers* should challenge him in court
