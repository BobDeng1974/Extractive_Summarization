it was condemned as blasphemous upon its release , and caused outrage among @entity4			0
but three decades later , a leading churchman has declared that @entity7 film @entity6 is in fact a ‘ remarkable tribute to the life of @entity11 ’			1
the rev professor @entity12 , who sits on the @entity13 , said @entity4 who opposed the satirical film were ‘ embarrassingly ’ ill - informed			1
all change : @entity7 's 1979 film @entity6 satirised the life of @entity18 and a senior clergyman has said the @entity20 was wrong to try to get it banned because he believes it is an ' extraordinary tribute to @entity11 ' the 1979 film follows a hapless fictional character called @entity24 , who is born at the same time as @entity11 and is inadvertently proclaimed to be the @entity25			1
@entity11 ’s only appearance is during the @entity27 , when @entity24 is standing at the back of the crowd and struggling to hear his words			0
professor @entity12 , @entity31 of @entity32 , said the film ’s depiction of 1st century @entity35 was probably more accurate than in many @entity37 films about @entity11			1
and he said the fact that the comedians had set out to write a satire about @entity11 but had to resort to using a fictional failed messiah instead was a tribute to the uniqueness of @entity18			0

it was wildly popular but was also widely criticised he said : ‘ i think it is an extraordinary tribute to the life and work and teaching of @entity11 – that they could n’t actually blaspheme or make a joke out of it			1
‘ they were satirising closed minds , they were satirising fundamentalism and persecution of others and at the same time saying the one person who rises above all this was @entity11 … and i think that the @entity20 missed that			2
’ fresh start : the @entity79 have reformed but member @entity54 says if they tried to make the film today they would face an army of ' heavily armed ' fanatics , making it impossible to do many @entity4 at the time , led by campaigner @entity84 , considered the film an outrage for supposedly poking fun at @entity88 , and picketed cinemas to have it banned			0
it was outlawed by 11 councils , and the ban in @entity94 , @entity95 , was only lifted in 2008			0
professor @entity12 made the comments on @entity98 ’s today show , which was being guest - edited by @entity7 @entity54 .			0
