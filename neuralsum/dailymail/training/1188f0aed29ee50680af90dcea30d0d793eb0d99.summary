@entity2 's chances of regaining power are under serious threat from looming ‘ annihilation ’ by the @entity5 in @entity6 and an unprecedented surge by the @entity8 in the rest of the country , polls suggested yesterday			1
a @entity13 survey suggested @entity2 are set to lose all but five of their 40 mps in their traditional @entity6 stronghold in may ’s general election			1
it also showed that just two per cent of @entity6 say they completely trust @entity19 – far less than the 24 per cent who professed belief in the @entity22 in a separate poll conducted in 2012			1
it would also put the @entity5 in a position to determine who should form the next @entity37 government , either by entering a coalition or offering to support a minority government			0
@entity6 ’s first minister @entity40 , addressing the @entity42 parliament for the final time before bowing out , dropped his heaviest hint to date that he intends to return to @entity37			0
mr @entity40 , who was last week replaced as leader of the @entity5 by his former deputy @entity46 , said it had been the ‘ privilege ’ of a lifetime to serve in the post he has held since 2007			0
in a nod to growing speculation that he is planning to be a key figure in @entity37 in another hung @entity53 , he said : ‘ i have absolutely no idea if my experience of minority government in this place will come in handy in another place			0
’ the @entity6 survey confirmed recent polls showing an extraordinary surge for the @entity5 in the aftermath of its defeat in september ’s independence referendum			2
a separate poll conducted in 2012 found that 24 per cent of people professed belief in the @entity70 monster it put support for the party for next year ’s general election at 46 per cent , compared with 24 per cent support for @entity2			1
the @entity76 were on 17 per cent and @entity77 six			0
the @entity5 said it was the largest lead for the party in @entity37 that @entity13 has ever recorded			0
those who would lose their seat include @entity82 , who is standing to be the next leader of @entity2 and @entity85 ’s election campaign chief @entity86			2
@entity5 @entity37 leader @entity87 said : ‘ this is enormously encouraging			0
it reflects all recent surveys in underlining the strength of the @entity5 vote , and is a further demonstration that @entity2 and the other @entity37 parties are facing a major backlash in @entity6			1
‘ with a majority of people in @entity6 saying that they distrust @entity19 , @entity99 and @entity100 , this poll is a disaster for all three @entity37 parties			1
‘ we take absolutely nothing for granted , and know there is a huge amount of hard work to be done in the weeks and months ahead - but there is no doubt that the @entity5 have momentum going into next year ’s @entity37 election			0
‘ these record leads for the @entity5 reflect the fact that people are putting their trust in the @entity5 to stand up for @entity6 , and ensure that the ‘ extensive new powers ’ we were promised by the @entity37 parties in the referendum are delivered			2
’ those who would lose their seat include @entity82 , who is standing to be the next leader of @entity2 and @entity85 ’s election campaign chief @entity86			2
separately , a @entity120 poll across the @entity121 put the @entity8 on a record high of eight per cent – suggesting it is eating into the disaffected former @entity77 supporters who @entity2 had been banking on for victory .			1

only two per cent of @entity6 say they completely trust @entity2 's @entity19
separate poll found 24 per cent professed belief in the @entity70 monster
survey suggests @entity2 are set to lose all but 5 of 40 mp 's in stronghold
