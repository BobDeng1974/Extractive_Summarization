on a hotel terrace in @entity2 , @entity0 was asked for his opinion on the state of @entity6 ’s team			2
then the @entity9 manager , the @entity10 shook his head before expressing what a pity it was that their brightest young player was such a troublesome individual			2
@entity0 appeared to see it as something of a national tragedy , and something that would undermine @entity6 ’s chances of success there in @entity22 three years later			1
@entity23 was 21 at the time , and younger still when @entity24 all but wrote him off too			1
the precociously gifted striker , @entity24 had concluded in their time together at @entity27 , was ‘ unmanageable ’			2
@entity29 manager @entity28 speaks with @entity30 striker @entity23 during training on wednesday the @entity29 frontman has struggled for form during the first three months of the his career at @entity35 the @entity6 international has long had a reputation for being a talented but troublesome individual former @entity9 boss @entity0 felt @entity6 's chances of @entity41 glory would be undermined by @entity23 @entity42 boss @entity24 was in charge of @entity23 at @entity27 but claimed the striker was ' unmanageable ' @entity23 scored his first goal in nine matches for the @entity30 against @entity47 in the @entity48 on wednesday quite how @entity23 responds to such damning verdicts i could n’t say			1
he ’s not a player i ’ve had the opportunity to interview			2
but i suspect even the most cocksure young man , one trying to make his way in a tough profession , would be sensitive to the opinions of two of the finest football managers in @entity59			2
i ’d consider it more likely such words would cut deep , given that rejection has been such a central theme in @entity23 ’s life			1
as we know , his childhood was spent mostly in foster care			2
and even if those foster parents were as wonderful as he says , so wonderful he eventually adopted their surname , those formative years must have been tough when the authorities had to place him in care when he was three - years - old			2
to begin with he would spend weekends with his biological parents and siblings , but eventually that stopped too			2
it was not until his 18th birthday that @entity23 was able to apply for @entity10 citizenship			1
but he did so because he felt more @entity83 than @entity84 , his biological @entity86 family name			0
@entity23 , pictured with foster parents @entity88 and @entity83 , gained @entity10 citizenship when he turned 18 @entity23 celebrates with @entity89 and @entity90 during august 's 3 - 0 win over @entity92 @entity93 @entity94 2006 - 07 league appearances : 2 goals : 0 @entity27 2007 - 10 league appearances : 59 goals : 20 @entity98 2010 - 13 league appearances : 54 goals : 20 @entity100 2013 - 14 league appearances : 43 goals : 26 @entity29 2014 - league appearances : 7 goals : 0 * @entity23 's two goals for the @entity30 so far this season have come against @entity105 in the @entity106 and @entity47 in the @entity48 he had rejected a senior international call - up from @entity86 when he was just 16 , opting instead to play for @entity6 and eventually making his debut two days before his 20th birthday			1
if he adopted @entity6 not everyone in @entity6 was quite so keen to adopt him			0
as an 18 - year - old playing for @entity27 he was racially abused by @entity113 supporters , and suffered further abuse from supporters of other clubs the following season			0
none of this necessarily excuses his behaviour these past few years but it might go some way to explaining why he can pose problems even for skilled man - managers of the pedigree of @entity24			0
@entity23 ’s behaviour has exposed not only a lack of maturity but a lack of judgement			1
he can be surly , selfish , unruly , and a huge frustration to his coaches given how brilliant he so often is in training			0
but does that mean he should be dismissed as a lost cause ? does that mean every manager out there should consider him more trouble than he ’s worth ? or do you attempt to harness that considerable potential , attempt to show him some understanding and hope that , in time , a player who is still only 24 can mature into a proper professional ? it is abundantly clear @entity23 was not at the top of the shopping list @entity28 scribbled down after losing @entity148 to @entity149			1
@entity29 ’s manager admitted it was ‘ a calculated risk ’ , even if £ 16million might amount to a fairly expensive risk			1
but a swapped shirt , a flicked ear and some indifferent appearances aside , just how big a headache has he so far proved for his latest employers ? @entity23 was not one of @entity28 ' top targets but joined the club in a £ 16million deal from @entity100 the @entity10 swapped shirts with @entity164 's @entity163 as the @entity30 trailed at half - time in the @entity106 i ’m told he has n’t been fined and he has n’t once been late for training , even if @entity28 has taken steps to make sure he is always punctual by having a driver take him to and from his new home in @entity171 on @entity172			1
he has not been a nuisance in training			0
on the contrary , he appears to be popular among his team - mates and committed to working hard			0
this week @entity90 said as much			0
if @entity28 says he wants to change @entity83 , it is more in the way he plays than in the way he conducts himself			1
@entity29 manager @entity28 is keen to help and improve the former @entity98 frontman @entity181 is n't to blame - @entity28 he wants to see more movement and he wants to see him occupy a role that will create an effective partnership with @entity90 once the @entity9 striker has returned from injury			1
in a newspaper column @entity187 suggests @entity28 is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole , but let ’s see			1
@entity28 will work with @entity23 and at the same time he wants @entity83 to work with dr @entity192 , in the hope that the prominent sports psychiatrist can help him develop into the player @entity29 ’s manager sincerely hopes he can become			1
@entity192 is not a miracle worker , and earlier this year far too much emphasis was put on the role that he plays			0
to the point , in fact , where it all became nonsensical and rather unfair			0
@entity28 wants @entity23 to work with dr. @entity192 , hoping the sports psychiatrist can help the striker @entity192 , pictured with sir @entity206 and @entity207 , worked with the @entity9 team at the @entity41 when @entity29 lost out on the title , it was somehow @entity192 ’ fault			1
when @entity213 lost the world snooker final , again it was @entity192 ’ fault			0
indeed when @entity9 followed a spirited display against @entity6 ( albeit one devalued by a @entity23 goal ) with two utterly woeful performances , it was @entity192 ’ fault			1
never mind that @entity192 had only a few weeks with the players			0
any apparent mental weakness was down to him			0
all @entity192 can ever do is give an athlete the tools he believes can help them achieve their goals			0
after that it still very much remains up to the athlete			0
but ask @entity227 how important a role @entity192 has played in enabling him to overcome a stress - related illness and return to top class cricket			0
this week he was invited to tour with the @entity231 this winter			0
ask @entity213 how @entity192 guided him back from the brink of premature retirement and helped him to win more world titles			0
ask sir @entity235 and @entity236 the extent to which @entity192 helped them achieve their success			2
asked sir @entity241 why @entity192 is such a valued member of his staff			0
@entity23 climbs above @entity243 to power a header past @entity245 as @entity6 beat @entity9 1 - 0 in @entity246 @entity23 celebrates after heading past former @entity98 team - mate @entity245 during the @entity41 in @entity22 @entity148 did not work with @entity192 as much as @entity28 would have liked , and it might help explain why a season when he appeared to be making such progress concluded with him biting another opponent at the @entity41			1
but i only have to listen to @entity227 to believe that if anyone can help @entity23 conquer whatever demons might still be troubling him , it is @entity192			1
it might not work , and what @entity28 is trying to do might not work either			1
but let ’s at least give them a bit of time .			0
