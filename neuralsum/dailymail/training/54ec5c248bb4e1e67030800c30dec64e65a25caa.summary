moments before the blast , the man is seen standing next to the pump and appears to realise something is wrong as he reaches out to pull the hose from his vehicle			0
but just as he grabs hold of the black plastic tube the vehicle 's gas tank , which is under enormous pressure , blows up			0
a slow motion replay shows debris from the vehicle , including the heavy metal gas tank itself , flying across the petrol station forecourt as the man staggers away			2
mercifully the gas does not ignite , had it done so it is likely the entire petrol station would have gone up in flames and the man would have almost certainly been killed boom : the vehicle 's high - pressure gas tank explodes just a few yards from where the driver is standing flashpoint : the gas tank blows up releasing a cloud of natural gas the vehicle 's door is sent flying open as debris is scattered over the forecourt clapped out : the vehicle is left a battered wreck as the man staggers across the forecourt the incident happened at a petrol station in @entity67 earlier this month			1
despite having the third largest amount of oil reserves in the world , @entity67 has invested heavily in natural gas which is cheaper and cleaner burning .			0
