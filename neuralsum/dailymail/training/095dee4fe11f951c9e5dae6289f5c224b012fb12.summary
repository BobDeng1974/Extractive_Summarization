by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 23:20 est , 23 october 2013 it 's perhaps the ultimate bar snack - but it could leave you just as hungover as the liquid refreshments on offer at your local pub. a @entity8 firm has introduced a range of unique beer ice creams , and unlike your usual tub of raspberry ripple , cookie dough or vanilla , they are alcoholic			2
the ice cream , called @entity16 , comes in seven different flavours with the strongest having an alcohol level of 3.2 per cent - the same as a low - point beer			1
comfort food : a @entity8 firm has created the ultimate bar snack - beer ice cream drink up : the range of ice creams comes in seven different flavours with a range of alcoholic strengths the new range is the brainchild of @entity30 , from @entity31 , who says that the idea was born purely out of accident			1
' we were having a party and a friend brought over an ice cream maker to make homemade ice cream , ' explained the 29 - year - old			0
' but another friend spilled a beer nearby , and i watched it happen and thought " this is a great idea ! " ' i 'm really passionate about craft beer , and love ice cream , so i picked it up as a hobby and started experimenting with different flavour combinations			2
' we start with the beer as it is all about finding the best , most flavourful craft brews - and then build a flavour around them			0
' unusual : among the flavours on offer are @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 alcoholic : a full pint goes into each tub - but you 'd have to drink a lot of it to get drunk flavours on offer at a variety of bars and stores in and around @entity70 , @entity71 , include @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity59 and @entity77			1
the @entity79 flavour is the strongest at 3.2 per cent , while @entity72 is the weakest			1
each 450ml tub is $ 6.99 ( Â£ 4.33 )			0
although you 'd have to drink a lot of the ice cream to actually get drunk , it 's perhaps the only frozen snack that you might need @entity85 to buy			0
novel : the idea for the ice cream came about purely by accident - one of the company founder 's friends spilled some beer near an ice cream machine at a party mr @entity30 added : ' the amount of alcohol varies by flavour - it depends on the content in the beer , as well as how much beer is added to the mix. ' our current flavours range between one per cent and 3.2 per cent but sometimes our specialty , limited release flavours come out a little higher			1
' you must be of legal drinking age to purchase and consume and we believe it 's the first product of its kind			0
' one pint of @entity16 ice cream is equal to one pint of beer - so you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get drunk ! '			0

frozen pints come in seven different flavours including @entity75
the strongest flavour is @entity74 which has an alcoholic level of *3.3* *%*
