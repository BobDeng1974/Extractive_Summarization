by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 2 may 2013 a three - time liver transplant recipient is finally healthy enough to realise her dream of modelling as she has reached the @entity6 regional finals			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in the @entity9 , will be taking to the stage to compete in the final of miss @entity12 on sunday			1
the brave 20 - year - old has overcome more than any other contestant at the beauty contest , enduring three liver transplants			2
if @entity7 is crowned miss @entity12 on sunday , she says she will use it as an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of donating your organs @entity7 , aged 16 , before her liver problems began			1
she is now feeling better than ever after her three liver transplants and is hoping to impress the judges at this weekend 's miss @entity12 finals @entity7 was rushed to hospital in october 2010 after she collapsed at home			1
despite never having drunk alcohol , she was told she had the liver of a chronic alcoholic and would die without a transplant			2
and if that was not enough , the private @entity35 plane carrying the first donated organ from @entity37 crashed in thick fog at @entity40 in november 2010			0
amazingly , rescue workers found the organ in ' pristine ' condition packed inside the charred red ice box			0
@entity7 was hours from death at the time but her life was saved by fireman @entity48 who freed the pilot from the smouldering cockpit before returning for the organ			1
the container was strapped to a motorbike and police closed major roads during rush hour as it was raced to the @entity57 in @entity12			2
and just 45 minutes after the plane crashed , the liver was successfully transplanted into @entity7			2
@entity7 will take to the catwalk in front of judges at @entity63 , @entity12 , with one thought in mind			1
@entity7 's first liver transplant made headlines in 2010 after the plane carrying her new liver crashed			1
amazingly the liver survived the crash and was transplanted into the hopeful model 45 minutes later @entity7 was desperately ill before she received her third liver transplant last year			1
her body had rejected two other livers but now she is feeling well enough to pursue a career in modelling			2
she said : ' i 'm going out to experience the new life i 've been given			0
' until recently @entity7 believed a career in modelling was beyond her reach			2
her body twice rejected transplanted livers and there was an agonising wait for a third organ			1
but just over a year after her last operation , @entity7 is finally able can again live a normal life			2
bright future : @entity7 is looking for ward to the @entity91 @entity12 finals on sunday but she admits she is feeling very nervous @entity7 thought taking part in miss @entity12 would ' be a giggle ' and was surprised when she made the finals ' we did n't think there would be a life for me , ' she said , ' but my health is the best it has ever been			1
i 've had no hospital admissions and my blood is fine			0
' cheering her on at this weekend 's final will be proud parents @entity105 and @entity107			0
three - year - old sister @entity108 is too young to attend , but is already boasting : ' i 'm going to be a princess			0
' @entity7 added : ' i saw an advert for the competition and said , " that would be a giggle "			0
before i fell ill , i wanted to go into modelling , but my confidence went down			0
' supportive : @entity7 is pictured with her little sister @entity108 and her parents @entity105 and @entity117 shortly after her first liver transplant in 2010 she was selected for the final after attending a heat at @entity121			1
' i was surprised they got back to me , ' she admitted			0
' it 's exciting , but i 'm very nervous			0
' if crowned , @entity7 will use her year as the face of @entity12 to hammer home the importance of becoming an organ donor			1
' the bottom line is if i 'd not had a transplant i would n't be where i am now			0
organ donation has been a taboo subject , but if people can see it as an important issue that would be brilliant			1
' former fashion student @entity7 has dedicated her ' new life ' to campaigning for more donors and runs a blog called @entity138 ! on the topic			0
she also hopes to work in the bridal industry			0
sunday 's winner will walk away with a clutch of prizes and a place in the @entity6 final .			0

@entity7 , 20 , will be competing in miss @entity12 finals on sunday
until recently was unsure whether she would live as body rejected 2 livers
but third liver transplant was a success and she feels ' better than ever '
if she wins she wants to use opportunity to publicise organ donation
