@entity5 , 59 , from @entity6 , was urged by his wife to get checked after a razor nick failed to heal			1
his gp immediately sent him for a biopsy which diagnosed the cancer and he has now made a full recovery			1
initially , @entity5 was n't concerned when he cut himself			1
but over several days his cut grew , became raised and changed colour			1
when his gp saw his face he ordered an immediate biopsy which revealed cancer @entity5 , who is married to @entity18 , 60 , and has three daughters , @entity20 , 31 , @entity21 , 30 and @entity22 , 27 , said : ' i was having a shave and nicked my skin			1
' there was a slight cut and it bled but it was n't anything unusual so i did n't think anything of it			1
' i thought it would heal in a couple of days			2
i thought i 'd just taken the top layer off my skin but over the course of a few days it started to change colour			1
' the wound also started to change shape , grow bigger and become slightly raised			2
' although i thought it was unusual , i was just going to leave it and see if it healed over time			0
it was my wife who urged me to get it checked out			0
i thought i would be wasting the doctors ' time but @entity18 told me that it could n't harm and it 's best to know about these things			2
@entity5 had always worn sunscreen while holidaying abroad , but it was doing everyday activities like gardening that caught him out @entity5 , accounts manager for an international tyre company , was sent straight to @entity57 for further tests			1
' i was given a biopsy at the hospital that very same day			2
no one seemed to know what was wrong so they took some cell samples from my cheek			2
' ten days later , when the results came back , @entity5 was diagnosed with skin cancer			1
doctors told him that he has a very thin melanoma which was around 1mm in depth			0
@entity5 went for an operation a few days after he was diagnosed , where 1cm of skin surrounding the cut was removed from his cheek			1
since the operation , @entity5 has been given the all clear and now must attend a check - up every six months			1
he said : ' they said it 's less common than other skin cancers but it much more dangerous if it 's not found early			2
' they think it is likely that it was triggered by the sun. ' i was in complete shock when i heard the news			0
i thought the doctor was going to say it was nothing , maybe just an infection or something , and never expected anything like that			0
' i am so grateful to my wife that she encouraged me to get checked			0
@entity96 only knows how long i would have waited if she had n't said anything			0
' the fact it was caught earlier means it was much easier to treat			0
i 'm so happy that i 've been given the all clear now but i know that , had it not been for cutting myself and @entity18 's persistence , things could have been a lot worse			0
' he is now urging people to use sun tan cream and is backing a campaign by national charity @entity108			0
@entity5 said : ' i tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they 're outdoors - even when they 're doing everyday things like gardening			1
it 's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - i 've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun ' @entity5 said he had always been careful to wear sunscreen while holidaying abroad , but it was doing everyday activities like going out walking , gardening or playing sport when people can get caught out			1
' i tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they 're outdoors			0
it 's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - i 've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun. ' i 've realised that you ca n't be too careful			1
uv rays are there all the time , even if it does n't seem sunny			0
' i hope that my experience can in some way help others and encourage people to take more care in the sun. ' the number of people diagnosed with malignant melanoma , the most serious type of skin cancer , in the @entity150 is on the rise with 35 people diagnosed every day			1
@entity153 , skin cancer nurse specialist on the @entity155 , said : ' research shows that , despite being aware of the health risks , people are still burning themselves in the sun in order to get a tan			2
' as we start to look forward to summer after one of the coldest winters yet , it is alarming that staying safe in the sun is not a priority for many people			0
' @entity169 will cause serious damage to your skin which can lead to cancer			2
a diagnosis of malignant melanoma can be just as fatal as some other cancers			0
' it is vital to protect your skin when out in the sun by using sun tan lotion , wearing sun protective clothing including hats and sunglasses or staying in the shade between the hours of 11am and 3pm			0
