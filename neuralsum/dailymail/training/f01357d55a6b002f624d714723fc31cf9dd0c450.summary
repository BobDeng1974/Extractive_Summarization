she sobbed at @entity40 last friday as she was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from driving for two years			1
guilty : @entity7 , pictured arriving at @entity40 , was revving her car to rebuke two pedestrians the court heard that @entity7 was driving her black and orange @entity45 in the outside lane of the dual carriageway at the time of the incident			1
as she approached the crossing she saw two pedestrians who she thought were walking ' deliberately slowly ' , so she revved the engine loudly			1
prosecutor @entity53 said as she reached the crossing she was still staring at the two pedestrians , just missing them as they stepped onto the pavement			1
it was only when she turned back to the road that she saw mrs @entity14 in the road , by which time it was too late to avoid a collision			1
witness @entity62 said : ' i noticed a female on the central reservation who was very upset , i believed her to be the driver of the vehicle involved			2
i went to her and tried to assist her and calm her down			0
' she said , " two kids were messing about around the junction			0
i revved my engine to scare them because they were messing about "			2
' @entity72 , a driving instructor , added : ' the female driver of the car was in hysterics on the central reservation and was screaming , " i want my dad "			2
she then said either " it revved " or " i revved it "			2
' sobbing : @entity7 was seen crying by the side of the road following the collision in june last year the two pedestrians involved also gave evidence - @entity84 said : ' just after the crash i did see the driver get out of the car in a distressed state and i heard her say , " i ca n't believe i 've just killed someone			1
" ' @entity92 said : ' when we got to the central reservation we could see cars in the distance but they were far enough away for us to make the call to cross			0
' as we got close to the pavement i heard a loud noise and it was like a car was revving its engine , so i grabbed @entity84 and we ran on to the pavement			0
the car 's exhaust made two really loud noises , it was increasing in volume			0
' @entity7 said she did not use her horn because she did not want to disturb anyone , adding : ' they continued to stare at me and i stared back			1
they were a hazard in my way and when i stared back , there was another hazard in the way			0
' mrs @entity14 was described as an ' independent and spritely pillar of the community			2
' in a statement her family said : ' @entity14 was a wonderful wife , mother , grandmother and great - grandmother who loved her family very much			1
' she helped countless people within the community and was the kind of person who was always willing to help everybody			0
' @entity131 : @entity7 , a 21 - year - old artist , has been barred from driving for the next two years in mitigation , @entity132 said : ' this is a momentary lapse of judgement , by somebody who is new to driving			1
the two pedestrians had hidden mrs @entity14 from view beyond the crossing			1
' my client has demonstrated genuine and substantial remorse and has been significantly traumatised by what took place			0
she has apologised every day in her head			0
she was a talented artist , described in testimonials as gifted , but humble			0
people say that since the accident , she has become a changed person and retreated into her shell			0
' judge @entity151 told @entity7 during sentencing : ' it seems plain to me that inexperience must have played some part in this accident			2
' clearly , your attention was focussed on them long after it should have been			0
it 's clear to me that this is not a case where there is a momentary lapse of attention			0
' there was at least an element of you rebuking these people by continuing to stare at them and that meant you did n't see mrs @entity14 , who was in front of you , until it was far too late			2
you struck her and you killed her			0
' it is clear you are a bright young woman , cherished by your family , but @entity14 was also somebody cherished by her family			2
' after her death , her husband in particular was devastated			0
he could n't go home for many months and when he did , he could n't bring himself to sleep upstairs			0
' it 's apparent that he changed from being a happy , confident man into being an absolutely inconsolable , unhappy man in the last few months of his life			0
