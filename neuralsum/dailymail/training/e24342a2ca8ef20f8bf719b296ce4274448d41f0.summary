air conditioning has n't changed much over the past century - most options are energy hungry and many are noisy and pretty unsightly			1
but one company has taken inspiration from nature to create an innovative alternative that does n't require electricity and in theory is n't even visible			2
using a substance called hydrogel , experts have created walls that absorb moisture to ‘ sweat ’ - like human skin - and cool the interior of a building			1
architects in @entity20 have invented a new type of air conditioning			1
a substance called hydrogel that could be used in walls ( shown ) and can absorb water and then ' sweat ' the technique was developed by architects from the @entity29 in @entity20			1
hydrogel is useful because it can swell to 500 times its size and absorb water			2
the unprecedented drought afflicting @entity34 is ' very likely ' linked to human - caused climate change , researchers at @entity36 found			2
they say a persistent region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the @entity40 that diverted storms away from @entity34 was much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations			0
it is one of the most comprehensive studies to investigate the link between climate change and @entity34 's ongoing drought			0
the report found that high - pressure ridges like the one that stubbornly parked itself over the @entity40 for the past two winters , blocking storms from hitting @entity34 , are much more likely to form in the presence of man - made greenhouse gases			2
the ridge , dubbed the @entity60 by researchers , or ' @entity62 , ' parched the state during the past two rainy seasons			0
when air around it heats up , this water evaporates and the air around the gel can be cooled by 5 or 6 ° @entity69 this means it has a sort of ‘ embedded intelligence ’ according to the team , as it will only begin cooling its surroundings when the temperature outside is hot			1
‘ in other words , when it is hotter outside , the interior responds by naturally decreasing its temperature , ' the team writes			0
' meanwhile , when evaporation is n’t occurring , the system does n’t cool the enclosed space			0
’ placing bubbles of the gel between two ceramic layers allows the innovative technology to then be used in walls			0
and as the hydrogels are simply little balls , the system can be moulded to fit a variety of structures			0
however , it ’s likely this technology would need to be used in tandem with existing air conditioning units to ensure a building reached a comfortable temperature			1
according to the team this could cut power usage in a home by 28 per cent , while carbon emissions could be cut by 124.6lbs ( 56.5kg )			0
@entity105 ( shown ) is useful because it can swell to 500 times its size and absorb water			2
when water evaporates from the substance it cools its surroundings hydrogel can be used to reduce temperature by five to six degrees			1
it could reduce our dependence on energy - hungry air conditioning units			1
