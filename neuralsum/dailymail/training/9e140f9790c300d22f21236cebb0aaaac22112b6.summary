by @entity0 keen - eyed viewers of the @entity4 ’s flagship @entity2 tv drama have spotted a nuclear power plant in the background of several scenes filmed on a beach			1
the @entity9 was filmed in the dunes and on the beach at @entity11 , @entity12 last year			1
the beach has featured in several episodes of the drama , which is set in @entity15 during the @entity2 , with one including a football match with several seconds of footage with @entity19 nuclear plant - built in 1957 - clearly visible in the background			1
out of time : @entity19 power station - built in 1957 - is visible during a scene from first world war drama @entity9 , which is set in @entity15 in 1915 authenticity ? the scenes were filmed at the beach and dunes of @entity11 in @entity12 last year @entity19 near @entity11			1
a @entity4 spokeswoman said : ' this one must have slipped under the radar ' @entity31 ’s @entity30 said : ' with all the modern technology available today to edit footage , i was a little surprised to see @entity35 had slipped through			1
' i was watching with my wife when i saw the nuclear power station in the background and said " hang on , that looks familiar - that was n’t there in 1915 ! " ' @entity4 spokeswoman @entity42 said the inclusion was an oversight			1
she said : ' while we do our utmost to ensure that every shot is period specific , this one must have slipped under the radar			1
' @entity31 's @entity30 said : ' i was watching with my wife when i saw the nuclear power station in the background and said " hang on , that looks familiar - that was n't there in 1915 ! " ' the series shows the lives of medics and their patients at a fictional field hospital in @entity15 during the @entity2 but mr @entity30 added : ' overall , the publicity has been superb and the beach has been featured several times which is great for the area			2
' @entity31 is delighted to have worked with the @entity4 during the production of the show at @entity11			2
the filming took place last autumn			0

' @entity71 is a " film friendly " council and regularly works with @entity73 to identify locations required by major film companies within the district			0
' the @entity77 were certainly an advanced civilisation , but as far as we know , they never discovered gas propulsion			0
but a scene in the hit film @entity82 suggests otherwise when a chariot strikes a wall and flips over - revealing a gas canister hidden beneath			0

researchers from the @entity95 , have discovered the brain merges together similar images seen within 15 seconds			0
without this skill , even simple changes in people ’s facial expression would be so overwhelming that we ’d feel like we were hallucinating			0
other famous gaffes include the incongrous sight of a white van clearly visible in the background of a huge battle scene in @entity108 and a crew member in a straw hat on board a pirate ship piloted by @entity113 in @entity114 : the @entity115			2
