@entity1 's work in the summer transfer market has been lauded as a masterstroke - with @entity4 making a profit while bringing in the likes of @entity7 and @entity8			1
but the @entity4 boss says future summers will be more like this one - with the @entity11 no longer willing to splash out hundreds of millions on star players as they were in the early years of @entity14 's reign			0
@entity1 reckons @entity15 will spell the end for @entity4 's days as big spenders - and says they will never match the £ 60million fee @entity18 have paid for @entity20 , breaking @entity4 's transfer record of £ 50m for @entity22 in january 2011			1
in every transfer window @entity4 is losing players , is selling players , ' @entity1 told @entity36			2
@entity4 's commercial revenue is far behind that of @entity18 - who have spent big on the likes of @entity20 and @entity41 during the summer - with the @entity11 bringing in just £ 30m a season from a kit deal with @entity44 compared to @entity18 's new £ 75m - a - year sponsorship			2
but @entity1 has no problems with cutting his spending after previously working on a shoe - string budget at @entity49			0
' @entity4 in this moment is not a spender – @entity4 in this moment is making more money in transfers than the money we spend			0
' so @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity18 ) – all these huge teams , i think they have an advantage			0
' big spenders : @entity18 splashed out on @entity20 and @entity1 says @entity4 ca n't match it cheap option : @entity66 arrived at @entity4 in a cut - price deal from @entity68 last week - costing just £ 10.5million			1

@entity1 says @entity15 will stop @entity4 spending
he believes they will have to match this summer 's profit - making
@entity4 sold @entity28 and @entity29 for £ *40m* and £ *28m* each
@entity7 and @entity8 have come in but @entity4 made a profit
@entity20 's record transfer will not be matched by @entity4 now
