the document suggests that the @entity1 should ¿ reduce the profile of the repatriation ceremonies ¿ as they reduce support for war repatriation ceremonies for the remains of dead soldiers should have a lower profile in order to make war more palatable to the @entity13 public , according to a report for the @entity1			1
it examines how to sway ‘ casualty averse ’ public opinion , a situation commonly known as ' body bag syndrome ' , and was published by the @entity1 ’s strategy formulation unit			1
the document suggests that the @entity1 should ‘ reduce the profile of the repatriation ceremonies ’ where coffins carrying deceased soldiers are brought back to @entity13 bases such as @entity25 in @entity26			1
it discusses ways to ‘ reduce public sensitivity ’ and methods of explaining that ‘ risks are knowingly and willingly undertaken ’ by armed forces personnel			1
suggestions included making greater use of the @entity35 and other special forces , as well as mercenaries , because it claims losses sustained by the elite soldiers and hired guns do not have the same impact on the public and press			1
' neither the media nor the public in the west appear to identify with contractors in the way that they do with their military personnel			2
thus casualties from within the contractorised force are more acceptable in pursuit of military ends than those from among our own forces			2
' it added : ' the public appear to have a more robust attitude to @entity60 [ special forces ] losses			1
' reassurances are made in the paper that the @entity13 public may not be as ‘ risk - averse ’ as they appear , and suggests this is ‘ based on recent , post- 2000 experience ’			2
‘ historically , once the public are convinced that they have a stake in the conflict they are prepared to endorse military risks and will accept casualties as the necessary consequence of the use of military force , ’ it says			2
the report adds : ‘ the public have become better informed and our opponents more sophisticated in the exploitation of the sources of information with the net result that convincing the nation of the need to run military risks has become more difficult but no less essential			1
’ the report also recommends the increased us of drones to reduce casualties the report , written in 2012 and released under the @entity94 , has been met with criticism by relatives of soldiers killed while serving their country			0
@entity99 , whose husband @entity100 was killed in a friendly fire incident in @entity102 in 2003 , described the proposals for repatriation ceremonies as ‘ brushing the deaths under the carpet ’			0
she told @entity107 : ‘ they are fighting and giving their lives			0
why should they be hidden away ? it would be absolutely disgraceful			0
’ the deaths of mercenaries , or ' private military contractors ' do not affect the public psyche as keenly as military personnel			1
file picture @entity99 , with others , gained a landmark ruling this year that relatives of killed or injured soldiers can seek damages under human rights legislation			0
an @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ it is entirely right that we publicly honour those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and there are no plans to change the way in which repatriation ceremonies are conducted			0
‘ a key purpose of the development , concepts and doctrine centre is to produce research which tests and challenges established doctrine and its papers are designed to stimulate internal debate , not outline government policy or positions			0
to represent this paper as policy or a potential shift of policy is misleading			0

report says images of flag - *draped* coffins reduces support for military action
it adds special forces and mercenary deaths do *n't* hit public as hard
@entity1 says document is to *foster* ' debate ' and is not policy
