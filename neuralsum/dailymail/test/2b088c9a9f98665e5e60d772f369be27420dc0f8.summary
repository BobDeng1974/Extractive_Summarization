@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 has revealed the team may have to make ' an unpopular call ' for their drivers in light of @entity7 's revival this season			1
following the first three races of the new @entity12 season it is clear @entity1 will not have it all their own way as @entity7 appear poised to push them all the way			2
@entity0 's remark also comes in the wake of @entity19 's moaning over the team radio during sunday 's @entity21 about how slow team - mate @entity22 was driving			1
@entity0 ( left ) says @entity19 ( right ) and @entity22 will have to deal with some ' unpopular calls ' @entity19 then turned on @entity22 during the post-race press conference , accusing the world champion of being selfish			1
@entity22 insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race , with the 30 - year - old exonerated of any wrongdoing by @entity0 and @entity1 non-executive chairman @entity31			1
but @entity0 has confirmed that with pressure from @entity7 , rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season , there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other			1
the @entity43 driver won the @entity45 grand prix but has come under fire from his @entity1 team - mate ' it may be if we are risking a win against @entity7 we would make an unpopular call , not to freeze everything , but manage them more , ' @entity0 said			1
' our number one objective , which is what we have decided with the drivers , is we have a big responsibility to the team and the brand			2
' it 's not just about those two guys - it 's about the thousand people working on those cars			0
' if it gets to the point where we have to interfere between the two of them because we risk losing a race win , then we would do that			0
@entity72 won two of the three @entity12 races this season and looks to be at the top of his game ' we do n't have the gap that we did last year where we can just let them push each other until the very end			0
we need to manage the gaps			0
' suggested to @entity0 he was risking @entity1 ' dna as racers - something he has insisted all along would never be tampered with - he replied : ' it depends on what you do			2
' we have seen in the past a clear team order that has stated ' you are not allowed to overtake ' even though the driver behind may be faster , for example			0
' this is not something i can honestly see happening			0
@entity7 and @entity96 have proved surprise tough competition in the race for the championship ' i can understand why teams in the past have done it because they were under threat of losing a championship			1
' @entity105 , we have n't been in that situation			0
but managing the situation more , without making such a drastic call , is a possibility now			0

@entity0 says the @entity1 drivers may be *unhappy* with some calls
@entity22 and @entity19 have fallen out after the @entity45 *gp*
@entity7 are proving tough competition and @entity0 says they must win
