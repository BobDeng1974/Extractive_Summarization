- invest in a pair of nipple covers from your local department store , these are great for creating a smooth look whilst also hiding any embarrassing moments during the colder weather ! - body tape is great for keeping your plunging neckline or open sides in the right places so you feel comfortable and confident all night long - just make sure you invest in a higher market brand so the tape sticks on place - avoid light polyester fabrics in colours such as white and cream , these tend to go see - through and are difficult to reduce exposure - choose fabrics that have a heavier weight to them such as a crepe or cotton , these will avoid the risk of exposing any nipple covers or body tape and will stay in place much easier - if you 're feeling a little exposed , try a longer hairstyle as this will cover you up slightly			0
