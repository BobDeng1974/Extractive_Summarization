by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 03:36 est , 12 september 2012 @entity2 's economy received a much - needed fillip yesterday after exports to countries beyond @entity6 surged to an all - time high			1
official figures showed @entity2 firms sold a record £ 13.2billion worth of goods to @entity12 markets in july - up 11 per cent on the previous month			1
sales to the @entity14 were also up 7.7 per cent to £ 12.4billion but the proportion of exports going to the 17 - nation eurozone fell to 43.6 per cent - the lowest since records began in 1988			0
exports to countries beyond @entity6 have surged to an all - time high , shrinking the @entity2 's trade deficit with the rest of the world the shift to growing markets in @entity26 and @entity27 , hailed by economists as a revolution in @entity2 trade , will cheer ministers and businesses who have toured emerging economies to forge new trade links as the single currency bloc lurches from crisis to crisis			1
@entity40 figures showed it helped shrink @entity2 ’s trade deficit with the rest of the world - the shortfall between exports and imports - from £ 4.3billion in june to £ 1.5billion in july			1
it was the largest narrowing of the trade deficit on record and fuelled hopes that @entity2 may finally be pulling out of recession			1
‘ tellingly , @entity56 exports have now been greater than exports to the @entity14 for three consecutive months , ’ said @entity52 , an economist at the @entity53 and @entity54			0
‘ this is perhaps unsurprising given the economic malaise gripping much of the @entity14 , driven by the sovereign debt crisis gripping the eurozone			0
‘ while the figures may demonstrate the weakness of the @entity6 export market more than the strength of @entity2 exporters in non-eu markets , the change in export share may represent an important shift in the focus of @entity2 exporters , as emerging economies become a more attractive proposition than struggling @entity6 economies			1
’ number crunching : balance of @entity2 trade over past year ( source : @entity40 ) the @entity2 economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year and has now been in decline for nine months - marking the longest double - dip recession for more than 50 years			1

the government is working hard to deliver sustainable , export - led growth			0
’ the latest export figures followed the biggest surge in industrial production for 25 years			0
‘ it is looking ever more likely that growth in the third quarter will more than outweigh the 0.5 per cent contraction suffered in the second quarter , ’ said @entity103 , chief @entity2 economist at research group @entity104			2
but with the crisis raging in the eurozone , and the global economy showing signs of slowing from the @entity115 to @entity116 , the outlook is still uncertain			0
@entity117 , chief economist at accountant @entity118 , said : ‘ the short - term outlook for exports remains fragile , with the eurozone on the brink of slipping back into recession and signs of a slowdown in the @entity115 and some of the main emerging markets like @entity116 and @entity128			2
‘ but we are more optimistic about prospects further out , providing that the eurozone remains intact and drags itself out of recession			0
