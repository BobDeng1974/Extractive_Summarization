by @entity0 @entity2 disease affects over 12,000 children a year in @entity4 and now scientists are one step closer to understanding one of the world ’s most mysterious illnesses			1
experts have found that the disease is deadliest when the wind blows from north eastern @entity12 , suggesting that it is caused by an airborne toxin that originates from the region			1
however , more research is needed the pinpoint which toxin it could be			0
the answer is blowing in the wind ? @entity2 disease affects over 12,000 children a year in @entity4 and experts might be one step closer to understanding the disease , which triggers a rash ( pictured left ) and peeling of the skin on hands ( right ) as they think it is caused by an airborne toxin originating from north eastern @entity12 the disease strikes children in @entity4 , the @entity31 and @entity32 , who are most at threat before their fifth birthday			1
symptoms of the disease include a red rash , fever , swelling and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet			1
left untreated , it can cause internal bleeding and heart attacks			0
some scientists are divided as to whether @entity2 is an infection or an immune response to a toxin			2
the new study built on previous work that suggested that large cases of the disease coincide with prevailing winds from @entity54 , @entity48 reported			0
mathematical ecologist @entity55 of the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , studied @entity4 health records between 1970 and 2010 to pinpoint the days on which the most cases were identified in @entity62 and other large cities			1
the experts used computer models to find out where the air had come from in the previous few days and discovered that on the days most children became ill , the air had come from the same region in north west @entity12 ( marked in red as well as @entity4 and @entity32 where cases of @entity2 disease were reported )			1
the air typically took two days to reach @entity4 , where the children became sick half a day later his team used computer models of airflow to find out where the air had come from in the previous few days and discovered that on the days most children became ill , the air originated from the same region in north west @entity12			1
the air typically took two days to reach @entity4 , where the children became sick half a day later , according to the study in @entity90			2
from the study , the researchers have surmised that the disease is airborne and has an incubation period of just half a day			0
they ruled out the possibility that @entity2 is an infection that spreads between children , because the vast majority of youngsters in large cities fell ill on the same days			2
the disease strikes children in @entity4 , the @entity31 and @entity32 , who are most at threat before their fifth birthday			2
symptoms of the disease include a red rash , fever and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet ( pictured left and right )			1
left untreated , it can cause internal bleeding and heart attacks the peak of the infection also died away when the wind changed direction and did not follow a typical pattern for a contagious infection			0
‘ it must be in the form of a toxin or some other environmental agent , ’ dr @entity55 said			0
the region thought to be the source of the toxin – the @entity126 - is highly agricultural so it is suspected that the toxin could be made by a fungus living on crops			0
the experts collected air samples by flying in the opposite direction to the prevailing winds			0
they found lots of species of @entity137 - a fungus genus responsible for common human infections – but the scientists are not claiming this fungus is the root of the problem .			0

experts from the @entity56 in @entity57 studied *incidences* of @entity2 and winds
they believe an *unidentified* toxin originating in an area of north eastern @entity12 causes @entity2 disease
the illness affects over 12,000 children a year in @entity4
symptoms of the disease include a red rash , fever and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet
