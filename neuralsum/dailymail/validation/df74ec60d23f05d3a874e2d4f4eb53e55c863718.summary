picking up their copy of the parish news , residents of the town of @entity2 were probably expecting the usual mix of announcements , reminders and perhaps a page or two of genteel religious discourse			1
instead they were treated to five pages of a minister ranting about his wife ’s adulterous affair			1
@entity15 , 54 , shamed his wife , @entity16 , 56 , in a 2,000 - word article that left many elderly worshippers in shock			1
@entity15 , 54 , churchwarden of @entity20 's @entity22 church in @entity2 near @entity23 , has accused his wife @entity16 ( pictured together ) of having an affair in an extraordinary rant in a parish magazine mr @entity15 claimed his wife @entity16 had committed the ' most heinous ' crime of any marriage by leaving him for her ex-police officer boyfriend in the 2,273 - word tirade , which he published in the parish magazine he edits in the piece , entitled @entity34 , mr @entity15 , a lay minister , accused her of conducting an affair behind his back and then abandoning him to set up home with her ex-policeman lover			1
he begins by telling parishioners : ‘ sadly , i have to report to you , my wife of 20 years recently ended our marriage and not in an amicable or hearty way			1
i am and have been in quite a mess			2
‘ she was constantly out till all hours most nights , coming home with flowers , even a teddy bear that went to bed with her and sat on my bed 24/7			1
this soft pushover ai n’t being pushed over anymore			2
’ the former media sales consultant wrote under the headline ' @entity57 ' : ' she would go missing for days at a time			2
it was blatantly obvious she was having an affair … and she came home from him and got in my bed			1
' how cold is that dear reader ? it 's heartless , cruel and just not on			1
talk about rubbing it in my face			2
' mr @entity15 , who is a lay minister at @entity20 ’s , a @entity70 near @entity23 , wrote in the @entity71 : ‘ i am bereft , numb , angry and disgusted with my estranged wife , a woman i have loved , worshipped and adored for 20 years			1
mr @entity15 published the rant in the @entity71 , which has now been retracted by the church for being ' totally inappropriate ' ‘ i understand relationships end … but to make the decision on your own , then go and jump into the first bed that comes along is wrong			1
’ ‘ why i am sharing all this with you ? simply to make you think about your actions that only you choose to do			2
‘ i can tell you that during my six years as warden to my own knowledge some 11 relationships have ended in adultery from our own church pews			2
we are supposed to be a beacon of light for @entity89			2
we are supposed to live life correctly			0
’ church leaders immediately recalled all copies of the magazine , prevented any further deliveries and ordered remaining copies to be pulped			2
some parishioners in @entity2 called for the @entity97 to intervene			0
one , who would not be named , said : ‘ he ’s obviously in emotional turmoil			0
we do feel for him but it was totally inappropriate			0
the parish magazine has never been so controversial			1
’ mr @entity15 , who joined the church in 1995 , became a church warden in 2008 and runs the church youth club			1
in 2010 he was made a lay minister and has been editor of the parish magazine for several years			1
he has been married to @entity16 for 20 years and the couple have a son @entity111 , 18 , while mr @entity15 has a daughter , @entity112 , 28 , from a previous relationship			1
in the article he says : ‘ i put a tract on her actions on my @entity118 page so all my family and friends found out together			2
she does n’t like being in the news			0
so when she gets passed this magazine , i ’m sure i will get berated from her			2
mr @entity15 said his wife @entity16 , 56 , would sneak out to meet her lover before returning to the marital bed			1
he said he wrote the five - page rant to parish worshippers because he wanted to ' highlight the impact adultery ' ‘ but she lost the right to tell me what to do as soon as she jumped into bed with another			1
she was so wicked to me that i am lost for words			0
sadly , dear readers , she is still trying to blame me			0
no one ever forces you into the arms of another man			0
’ mr @entity15 - who has another child , @entity112 , 26 , from a previous relationship - said he now ' regrets the turmoil caused ' but published the article because he wanted to highlight his wife 's alleged cheating			1
he told @entity144 : ' my intention was to highlight that marriages do break up and cause hurt and that adultery does occur			0
' she used to go missing for nights and days			0
it was pretty clear , she used to bring home flowers and teddy bears			0
' she also used to say she was going out for tea with the girls which i know she hated doing			0
' the night before she left she finally told me she had met someone else			0
mr @entity15 , who has two children , claimed the marriage breakdown had taken its toll on both him and the couple 's 18 - year - old son @entity111 ( pictured together )			1
he blames her for apparently leaving him for another man ' she has cheated on both her previous husbands as well			0
but when you fall in love with someone you fall in love warts and all			0
' we were together for 20 years and married 18 - and - a - half years			2
in the last few months she spoke to me awfully			0
' she 's ruined her life and reputation			0
our son , @entity175 , was 18 yesterday and she only saw him for 20 minutes and all she did was grill him about all of this			0
' i want this year to be remembered for @entity111 's 18th and good things as a family , not for what that woman has done to us all			0
' mr @entity15 , who joined @entity182 in 1995 and became a churchwarden in 2008 , said he is now planning to issue divorce proceedings			1
he said : ' the church are saying i 've brought them into disrepute but i 've worked for the parish magazine for 15 years and the majority of my stories have been happy			1
this is the reality of life and relationships and now i 'm being cast as a villain			0
mr @entity15 , a lay minister at @entity20 's @entity22 church in @entity2 near @entity23 ( pictured ) , described his wife as ' heartless and cruel ' and said he was now looking to issue divorce proceedings ' my whole intention was to help other people in an adulteress relationship			1
it 's the most heinous of crimes to a human being			2
' it 's knocked me out and it 's taken some swallowing			0
none of us deserved what she has done			0
' i had to go to bed at night knowing my wife was in bed with someone else			1
' i 've lost more than a stone in weight , none of us have been sleeping or eating and my son 's college work has suffered			0
' mrs @entity218 , who works at @entity219 in @entity220 , was unavailable for comment last night			0
a spokesman for the @entity223 said the church was ‘ supporting @entity15 through his personal difficulties			1
