they are among our most commonly seen birds , doing nothing more extraordinary than looking for food in an unremarkable back garden			1
frozen in flight by the camera , however , they become creatures of spectacular grace and beauty			0
in a fraction of a second , these incredible photographs capture the everyday activity of robins , tits , finches and other native species in a way the human eye never could			1
they transform the simplest manoeuvre into an aerial ballet ; show tiny wings in majestic , intricate detail			0
they also give a rare glimpse of the fierce competition for food and territorial supremacy in the avian kingdom			0
the moment was captured by photographer @entity44 @entity44 wanted to be able to capture the images of birds in free - frame while they are in mid-air without scaring the birds , which was a major task but just how does a photographer get close enough to freeze - frame the mid-air action in perfect focus , without scaring the birds ? simple , if you happen to be retired physicist and lifelong gadget enthusiast dr @entity44			1
he might have bought his first camera only four years ago , but his enthusiasm for @entity63 - style solutions to challenging problems has rapidly allowed his new - found hobby to take flight			2
hence , it was a succession of wacky looking , home - made devices that allowed him get the perfect shot			1
the first was nothing more complex than a twig attached to a post , wired up to trigger the camera shutter when a bird launched itself from the perch			0
the @entity80 version was a spring - loaded feeding platform ( it looks a little like a medieval siege - engine catapult ) — rigged up with a switch that operates an electrical circuit connected to the camera			1
dr @entity44 had to go back to the drawing board after a cheeky robin bounced up and down so excitedly on the platform , it produced hundreds of frames of an empty patch of air			2
the camera was focused on the spot where the robin should have flown ; instead , the bouncing bird kept triggering the shutter without actually taking off			0
the retired physicist designed an ingenious method of capturing the perfect image of the bird every time without scaring the subject dr @entity44 used his scientific know - how to attach a trigger to a twig with a pressure switch , when the bird launched itself from branch it set off the camera so in the weeks and months that followed , the devices were refined with infra - red or laser beams that fired the camera when the beam was broken by a bird or its shadow			1
result : a portfolio of stunningly clear photographs revealing the hidden beauty of birds in the early stages of flight , fighting each other , and feeding their young			2
yesterday dr @entity44 explained : ‘ the main point of all the geekery was , of course the photos , and some of them turned out astonishingly well			2
they show aspects of flight that would otherwise be unobservable — people tell me they have never seen birds flying like that before			0
all of them are just ordinary garden birds , so much overlooked			1
but to catch them in dramatic flight really pleases me			0
even the smallest ones look more magnificent than i could have expected			0
with their fully spread wings , they look every bit as impressive as eagles			0
you can see these birds every day , but the images give a new insight into what they actually look like			2
’ the photographs were all taken in natural light in dr @entity44 ’s back garden in @entity151 , then posted on a wildlife website he created to showcase them			1
needless to say , he ’s also on @entity155			0
dr @entity44 said he was concentrating on ordinary garden birds that he had seen out of the back of his @entity151 home but was able to capture the most amazing images dr @entity44 captured images which are normally missed of birds landing and taking off or fighting with each other			1

scientist @entity44 wanted to take photographs of ordinary garden birds in the most extraordinary situations
he wanted to capture the birds in *mid-flight* , in perfect focus , without scaring them away by his *presence*
the retired physicist rigged up an ingenious trigger device which enabled him to take these pin - sharp images
