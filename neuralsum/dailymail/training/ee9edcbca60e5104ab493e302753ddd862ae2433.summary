@entity0 wants @entity1 to win the @entity2 for @entity3 - and he is confident they can do so			1
there was a flat feeling around @entity7 late on friday night as the extent of @entity3 's injury began to filter through to the locals			2
the @entity11 had confirmed @entity3 would miss the rest of the @entity2 because of a fractured veterbra he suffered after being kneed in the back by @entity14			1
video leading the way : @entity0 celebrates giving @entity1 the lead on the run : @entity0 beats @entity19 to the ball their best player may be out of the @entity2 , but @entity0 insists @entity1 's dreams of lifting the trophy on home soil for the first time remain very much alive			1
the @entity1 captain was saddened to hear of @entity3 's injury , but after the match he was buoyant about his team 's chances of lifting the trophy on july 13 in the @entity33			1
' we have proposed to win the @entity2 for @entity3 because of the injury he suffered , ' the @entity36 - @entity35 defender said			2
' this moment could mark the start of a revolution for us			0
' he hopes and expects a lot from this group , and this could unite us , it could give us more determination to win			0
' crunch : @entity14 clashes with @entity3 agony : @entity3 clutches his back after going down injured during @entity1 's win over @entity52 on friday @entity3 may be 22 - years - old but he has dragged @entity1 through this tournament so far			1
the @entity56 forward 's pace , trickery and eye for goal make him a nightmare to defend against			0
the former @entity62 man is @entity1 's top scorer here , with four goals , and he also scored the crucial penalty to knock @entity65 out in the previous round			2
@entity67 , a diminutive 21 - year - old from @entity69 , and @entity71 's @entity70 , who played for the @entity72 until last summer , are not in the same class as @entity3 , but @entity0 is sure they could do a good job if called upon to face @entity76 in the semi-finals			1
carried away : @entity3 was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after @entity1 's quarter - final win ' @entity3 is very important for us			1
we depend a lot on him and he makes the difference in our group , ' said @entity0 , who put @entity1 ahead with an early strike			1
' but in the place of @entity3 , we can play either @entity70 or @entity67 , who have similar characteristics			2
' this is the moment to show the strength of the squad			0
' @entity14 apologised to @entity3 after the final whistle and @entity0 , who used to play for @entity92 , insisted the @entity94 defender did not mean to harm the forward			1
' @entity14 does not have any nastiness in him			0
i know him from @entity98 , ' he said @entity0			2
' what he did , i think , was rash			0
i still have not seen the pictures , but i know that in these circumstances it was difficult to get the ball off @entity3			0
i am a centre - back , and i know that in situations like this one should be looked at more thoroughly			0
' the whole game as an ill - disciplined affair			0
referee @entity110 failed to maintain discipline in a full - blooded encounter at the @entity113			0
a total of 54 fouls were committed , one of which came when @entity0 pulled back @entity52 goalkeeper @entity118			1
that foul meant the 29 - year - old will miss tuesday 's semi-final against @entity76 in @entity122			2
@entity52 , meanwhile , head home wondering what might have @entity126 's side looked down and out when @entity127 scored a stunning free - kick to put @entity1 2 - 0 up , but @entity129 converted an 80th minute penalty to cue a nervous finale			1
horror : x-rays confirmed @entity3 suffered a clean break in his back @entity129 has been just as key to @entity52 as @entity3 has been to @entity1 at this tournament			1
the 22 - year - old @entity137 forward has scored six goals at his first @entity2 , but that mattered little to him after friday 's defeat			0
' we are really sad because we wanted to progress , we wanted to make history tonight , ' @entity129 said			0
' this is a hungry team and that is what hurts us most - that we knew we could have progressed			0
