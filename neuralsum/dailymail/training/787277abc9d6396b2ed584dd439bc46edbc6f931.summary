statins : the inexpensive drug is taken by more than 7million @entity2 a year cholesterol - lowering statin drugs do not appear to help prevent blood clots , according to an extensive new study			1
researchers from @entity7 led a team that looked at 29 published and unpublished trials involving over 100,000 people			0
they found venous thrombosis ( a blood clot formed in a vein ) occurred in 0.9 per cent of people taking statins compared to one per cent of people who were not taking the drugs			1
there was no difference between those who took higher or lower doses of statins			0
the study , published in the open - access journal @entity25 , said : ' we were unable to confirm the large proportional reduction in ( clot ) risk			2
' however , it added that ' a more modest but perhaps clinically worthwhile ' effect could not be ruled out			0
in 2009 , a trial called @entity33 found that so - called rosuvastatin -- marketed as @entity35 -- halved the risk of blood clots among apparently healthy adults , a finding that boosted suggestions the drug should be taken preventively			1
but the figures to support this finding were relatively small			0
the 2009 study randomly assigned 17,800 people to take @entity35 or dummy pills			1
after two years of followup , 34 in the statin group and 60 in the placebo group developed a venous thrombo - embolism , a clot which can form in the legs and travel to the lungs			1
the latest study , led by @entity55 , found no such effect			1
commenting on the findings , @entity58 medical director , professor @entity57 , said : ' it has long been thought that statins may have additional health benefits on top of their proven ability to reduce heart attacks and strokes			2
' an earlier study suggested that one statin , rosuvastatin , might reduce the risk of blood clots in deep veins and lungs , known as venous thromboembolism			1
' however , findings in single studies can sometimes happen by chance			0
by pooling a large amount of data on several different types of statin , this analysis shows that any significant protection against blood clots is highly unlikely			1
' statins are taken by up to seven million @entity2 to combat high cholesterol			1
they work by blocking the action of key enzymes in the liver , which synthesizes the fat - like substance			2
just last week , scientists at the @entity93 discovered new genetic evidence inking cholesterol and cancer			0
the find means patients could one day be given statins to protect against developing cancer and to treat potential tumours			0
the drugs cost as little as 40p a day			0
@entity103 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity58 , said : ' statins are now a very important part of the lives of millions of people and play a vital role in both lowering cholesterol and helping prevent heart attacks			2
' their importance should nâ€™t be underestimated and the potential risk of side effects are outweighed by the proven benefits			0
the use of statins is the main reason why fewer people have high cholesterol levels now compared to 20 years ago			0

2009 study suggested daily statin could reduce leg blood clots that can travel to the lungs , but latest review found no such link
more than 7million @entity2 take the cholesterol - lowering drugs
