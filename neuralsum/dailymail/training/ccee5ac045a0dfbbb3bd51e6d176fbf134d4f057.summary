prime minister @entity0 should take a page out of his arch - nemesis @entity3 's book by getting on social media and mingling more with the community			1
that 's the suggestion of the owner of the country pub mr @entity0 dropped in on last week , after the nation 's leader was told he needs to get away from his ' latte - sipping ' advisers and put his policies to the ' pub test '			1
mr @entity0 chugged a couple of beers at the @entity16 in @entity17 for around 40 minutes last friday and today hailed his visit to the pub as a ' thrill ' in a ' make or break ' speech today			1
@entity22 said it was ' great ' to have the prime minister drop in and buy punters drinks			1
' he was very , very accommodating			0
' he had a lot of selfies			0
he just had a few beers			0
' ' no one was hitting him up with the hard questions , ' he said , and there was n't any curly questions about his knighting of prince @entity47			0
but mr @entity22 said it would n't hurt for mr @entity0 to take some inspiration from his predecessor , mr @entity3			1
' i think as the prime minister of the country a lot of your day is orchestrated - people are expecting you , you 're opening something			2
' to go and do something totally like , " i 'm in the car , let 's go to the pub " , i guess it was probably a little bit different for him because people were n't expecting it of him			2
i think it 's something he has n't done			2
' they could probably learn a bit off someone like @entity3 - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community , in that respect			2
' @entity0 's probably a little more straight down the line			1
it 's probably not going to hurt			2
' former prime minister @entity3 often went on walks through @entity77 in @entity78 , hosted community cabinets and was very popular on social media ' they could probably learn a bit off someone like @entity3 - voted in by young people based on social media and his presence in the community , in that respect , ' mr @entity22 said @entity17 , a town of around 10,000 , is located in the federal seat of @entity88			1
it was a @entity90 seat prior to the 2013 federal election , when @entity93 mp @entity27 swept previous member @entity94 from power			0
reflecting on mr @entity0 's recent decisions , mr @entity22 said he thought prince @entity47 was deserving of the knighthood , based on his record			1
but he still had a dose of real talk for the pm			0
' he 's done a lot for @entity103			0
there ' s a lot of facts behind it			0
' whether it 's a slap in the face to someone like @entity111 , who knows			0
' ' he 's deserving , yes			0
should he have been given it ? probably not			0
' @entity115 mp @entity114 last week urged mr @entity0 to visit the @entity116 in @entity117 , west of @entity118 , to get an ' honest appraisal ' of how the government could improve			1
in an interview with @entity122 , mr @entity114 said mr @entity0 needed to get away from the ' texting , latte - sipping , keyboard warriors who frequent the tapas bars of @entity128 and @entity129 '			2
mr @entity0 today said he had been ' warmly ' welcomed at the @entity17 pub. controversial pick : mr @entity0 today announced all honours will henceforth be decided by the @entity133 - not by himself , as happened with the knighthood of @entity47 ( above )			1

prime minister @entity0 's hailed his visit to a @entity17 pub as a ' thrill '
mr @entity0 visited the @entity16 in @entity17 for around 40 minutes
@entity22 says mr @entity0 was ' very , very accommodating '
@entity22 suggested he take a page from @entity3 's book
' it probably would n't hurt ' for mr @entity0 to get out and press the flesh
