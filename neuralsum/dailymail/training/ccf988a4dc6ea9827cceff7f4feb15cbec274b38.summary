by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 04:57 est , 10 march 2012 art specialist @entity1 wanted to exchange a £ 2,000 jacket , which was an unwanted gift , but instead she was detained by police for seven hours when @entity1 was given a £ 2,000 @entity5 jacket by a generous male friend , she faced an awkward dilemma			1
beautiful though it was , she felt it did not suit her			0
not wanting to upset her friend by telling him , she took the black quilted leather jacket back to @entity5 's flagship store in @entity13 and asked whether she could exchange it for something else			2
there the ancient art specialist found herself handcuffed , arrested and marched off to a police cell on suspicion of handling stolen or fake goods			1
to make matters worse , her friend was dragged into the row when he was telephoned as part of the criminal inquiry			0
now police have decided there is no case to answer , and have told @entity28 , 25 , she can collect her jacket from them			1
but there are still questions about its origins as @entity5 insists that it may not be the genuine article			0
miss @entity1 is mortified that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she did n't like his gift , and is furious that @entity5 has not apologised			1
she insists the explanation is simple			0
unbeknown to her , her friend had bought the jacket direct from the @entity13 manufacturer			2
that meant she was not entitled to a refund or exchange from @entity5 but she had no idea of that when she arrived at the shop			2
mortified : miss @entity1 is humiliated that her friend found out in such a dramatic way that she did n't like his gift , and is furious that @entity5 has not apologised she said @entity5 staff believed only six of the jackets had been made			1
one , a size 8 like hers , had been stolen from the store , leaving them fearing she was trying to exchange stolen goods			1
last night miss @entity1 , who works for an antiquities firm specialising in @entity57 , @entity58 and roman coins , told how the drama unfolded last week			1
' my friend is a generous person , and when he gave me the jacket i thought it was beautiful – but it did n't suit me , ' she said from her home in @entity66 , @entity67			2
miss @entity1 had been given the expensive black leather jacket by a friend , but wanted to return it ' i did n't want my friend to know i was trying to exchange it , but after a couple of months i phoned @entity5 to talk about the jacket , and decided to go into the new bond street store			1
' it took ages for it to be sorted out			0
the store manager kept telling me it would n't be much longer			0
eventually the police walked in			2
' i did n't know what was going on and when the police officer said i was under arrest for handling stolen goods i was in shock			1
then she whacked the handcuffs on me			0
i was so upset , i was in a mess			0
' miss @entity1 said that after waiting an hour for a patrol car to turn up , she was ' paraded ' down new @entity88 in her handcuffs on the way to a police station			1
' it was so humiliating , ' she said			0
' i was left in a cell for four or five hours and when i asked how long it would be they replied , " how long is a piece of string ? you could be looking at staying overnight "			2
' then hours later a detective breezed in and said they had got hold of my friend , who was on holiday in @entity104 , and he corroborated my story that the jacket was n't stolen			1
' it 's been hugely embarrassing , ' she said			0
' i feel angry and it 's left a bitter taste in my mouth			0
' a spokesman for the @entity113 said : ' following enquiries the woman was released and no further action was taken			0
' a @entity5 spokesman said staff called police after being ' forewarned that a customer was attempting to return a product which had not been sold by @entity5 '			1
she suggested the jacket was not authentic before declining to comment further .			0

@entity1 was held in a police station for several hours before they could verify her story
staff became suspicious as another jacket in same size had been stolen from the shop
