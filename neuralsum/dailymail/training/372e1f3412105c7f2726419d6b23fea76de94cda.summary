tens of thousands of @entity10 gathered in a square near the city 's iconic @entity15 on april 13 , 1919 and started protesting against the power of the @entity179			2
the protest was part of the growing independence movement , with strikes and demonstrations sweeping the country in the preceding months			0
it was this revolutionary background which made @entity211 @entity21 nervous about the protest , and which motivated his decision to order dozens of soldiers to open fire on the demonstrators			0
the troops , most of whom were themselves @entity10 , fired indiscriminately and without warning , killing hundreds - the official death toll was 379 , but @entity10 claim that around 1,000 protesters died			2
@entity21 had intended to suppress calls for independence , but instead the massacre ended up boosting them as previously pacific @entity10 rallied to the cause after hearing of the horrific slaughter			2
reactions in @entity64 were mixed , but many - including @entity8 , then secretary of state for war - were revolted by the killing			0
