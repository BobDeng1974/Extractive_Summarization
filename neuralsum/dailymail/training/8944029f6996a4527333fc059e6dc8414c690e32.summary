goals scored : @entity62 89 @entity6 did pull one back through @entity70 , but it was not enough to prevent @entity73 's side suffering their first defeat of the season			1
@entity0 had demanded a quick start from his new charges and he got one , with @entity41 making two powerful surging runs , the latter of which ended with the former @entity83 man working @entity50 with a low shot			2
but @entity3 's bright opening did not come without cause for alarm			0

the @entity6 manager sent his side back out very early for the second half and withdrew @entity55 in favour of @entity56			2
