@entity17 , a former military captain , talked of the starvation rife throughout the country			1
starvation is such a problem that prisoners would resort to eating animal feed , or even beans and maize kernels stuck in animal dung			2
isolation : @entity2 's prisons are so isolated it 's hard to get a grasp of the endless atrocities that occur within their walls starved : @entity2 sometimes resort to eating undigested food found in animal feces ‘ i saw piles of bodies [ of people ] who have died from starvation in public places , ’ said mr @entity179			1

it is so gruesome , you instinctively close your eyes or turn your head away … when all the gunshots have died down , you look and the body is heaped onto the ground			0
you can not sleep after witnessing it			0
you are haunted by the nightmarish image in dreams , ’ he said			0
the @entity74 has stated its hope that the year - long investigation , which involved speaking to @entity2 exiles in @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , might pave the way for criminal prosecution			2
