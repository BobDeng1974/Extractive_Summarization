by @entity0 his epic and ultimately ill - fated trip to the @entity3 is remembered for the demise of captain @entity5 in inhospitable @entity7 conditions			0
but 100 years on from history 's most doomed expedition , the real horror experienced by dr @entity9 has emerged - in the unlikely form of notes he took on the sexual habits of penguins			1
amidst his incredible survival against the odds in the @entity3 , dr @entity9 made groundbreaking notes on the sexual shenanigans of the @entity22 , with findings so shocking they remained hidden for decades after			1
rare : this picture of @entity22 penguins in the @entity3 was taken by expedition surgeon dr @entity9 during his ill - fated trip to the @entity7 a century ago documented : dr @entity9 's observations of the penguins ' deviant behaviour were chronicled in this logbook diarist : dr @entity9 in his finneskos - or reindeer boots ( left ) - and wrapped up against the elements ( right ) , during the expedition in which he ended up stranded in the @entity3 for eight months dr @entity9 's paper on penguin behaviour revealed evidence of homosexual acts , sexual abuse of chicks and even attempts by male penguins to mate with dead females			1
the @entity49 explorer was so shocked by the findings in his paper , ' sexual habits of the @entity22 ' , that he initially recorded them in @entity53 to make them inaccessible to the average reader			2
dr @entity9 observed how male adelie penguins would gather in ' hooligan bands of half a dozen or more and hang about the outskirts of the knolls , whose inhabitants they annoy by their constant acts of depravity '			1
to this day , @entity9 is the only scientist to have studied an entire breeding cycle at @entity66 after he spent the @entity68 summer of 1911 - 12 there , according to the @entity70			2
the expedition of captain @entity5 and his @entity73 crew to the @entity3 is widely - known as the one of the most ill - fated in exploration history			0
captain @entity5 had launched his bid to be the first man to reach the @entity3 , but perished with his companions in 1912 after being beaten to the pole by the @entity81 explorer , @entity82			0
dr @entity9 , meanwhile , had been part of a crew assembled to support captain @entity5 , only to become trapped themselves off the coast as @entity5 marched south into the heart of @entity68			1
incredibly , dr @entity9 and five colleagues kept themselves alive against all the odds for eight month in an epic survival trip to @entity91			1
the men battled the perilous polar winter and survived in part by eating penguin meat and seal blubber			2
they survived despite having been forced to spend an entire @entity68 winter in an ice cave , unaware captain @entity5 and four others had died			0
captain @entity5 and four others perished after reaching the @entity3 on january 17 , 1912 - only to find @entity81 explorer @entity82 had beaten them to it more than a month earlier			0
but @entity9 survived , despite having been forced with five others to spend an entire @entity68 winter in an ice cave with few supplies after the expedition ship , @entity73 , was blocked by ice on its way to rescue them			2
back in @entity113 , he published a paper called ' @entity115 of the @entity22 ' , but his findings about the species ' astonishing sexual behaviour were considered so shocking that they were omitted			2
this material was used for a short separate study , ' sexual habits of the @entity22 ' , that was privately passed around a few experts			0
the groundbreaking paper - which came around 50 years ahead of the next study on the subject - had been lost until the recent discovery of a copy by @entity129 , curator of birds at the @entity131			0
@entity129 has had the paper published in the journal @entity134 along with an analysis of @entity9 's work , the @entity70 said			1
@entity129 told @entity137 , that the penguins ' sexual inexperience is to blame for the antics that so disgusted @entity9			1
' @entity141 gather at their colonies in october to start to breed			0
they have only a few weeks to do that and young adults simply have no experience of how to behave , ' he explained			0
' hence the seeming depravity of their behaviour			0
' dr @entity9 , who served in the @entity150 after his return from the @entity3 , went on to found the @entity152 in 1932 , and died in 1956 .			1

@entity155 's polar findings *unearthed* after decades
dr @entity9 observed penguins sexually assaulted each other , as well as *committing* *necrophilia*
