@entity1 bombshell study : ' high risk of poor patient outcomes ' from @entity5 cuts we reveal 11 more casualty unites are in danger - making 25 in total thousands of readers respond to our petition to register their anger read the stories behind the closures - and find out how you can stop them by @entity16 and @entity17 sweeping plans to close casualty departments carry a ‘ code red ’ risk of having a serious impact on patients ’ health , a secret internal @entity1 study has revealed			1
the shocking disclosure comes in a risk - assessment dossier , prepared by officials pushing for the closure of four out of nine @entity5 units in @entity31 and obtained by @entity32			1
it comes as our campaign against the cuts gathers pace , and as : asked whether he would order a review of the closures in light of public opposition , mr @entity38 restated the policy of his predecessor , @entity44 , that changes must be ‘ locally led ’ by health professionals , and that ‘ the interests of the local community must be key ’			1
critics say that , in fact , many doctors oppose the cuts , as does the public			2
where @entity5 units are facing closure , @entity1 bosses have insisted that they have only one aim – improving patient care – and not saving money			1
critical list : @entity5 units are being closed or downgraded , with the public being urged to voice their discontent for example , in adverts designed to persuade sceptical residents of the benefits of radical closures in @entity31 , @entity1 bosses say it is a ‘ myth ’ that the cuts have been drawn up in order to save money			1
yet the secret report from the ‘ cluster board ’ responsible for commissioning health care for the two million people in the area clearly states that one objective is to deliver £ 1 billion of savings by 2014			0
the ads also state that it is a ‘ myth ’ , that the changes will put patients ’ lives at risk			0
yet the internal report , discussed at a closed meeting on september 7 , identifies a ‘ significant ’ risk of adverse effects			2
its most damning section concerns a ‘ new risk ’ to ‘ @entity91 ’ , the reorganisation itself			0
the risks are that the closure plans are ‘ not accepted by patients , politicians and public ’ , that the care provided by @entity99 is ‘ not robust enough ’ to support the enormous extra burdens the closures will impose , and that the ‘ new pathways of care ’ will therefore not be successful			0
the consequences – graded ‘ code red ’ for being ‘ significant ’ and ‘ serious ’ – would , the dossier admits , be ‘ poor patient experience and outcomes ’ , ‘ service gaps ’ , and the whole system becoming ‘ unaffordable ’			1
last night a spokesman for the @entity1 in @entity31 insisted that the risks would only apply if planned improvements to ‘ out - of - hospital ’ gp care did not go ahead			1
he said : ‘ we have said very clearly , in public meetings and in all our documents , that no changes would be made to any hospitals before we had first spent three years implementing the out - of - hospital changes			2
’ as to the £ 1 billion savings target , he said the @entity1 had never hidden its hopes to save money , but insisted that was not the main aim			2
the spokesman ’s statements drew a furious response from @entity131 mp @entity130 , whose @entity133 constituency includes two of the doomed a&es , @entity133 and @entity135			0
@entity136 and @entity137 are the others			0
‘ it ’s all very well saying no department will close for three years , but the decision will be announced in 2013 , ’ he said			0
‘ once you ’ve done that , how will the @entity134 attract staff ? they ’re likely very quickly to wither away			2
’ meanwhile , @entity32 today reveals another 11 areas where millions of patients could face longer journeys for @entity5			1
in @entity151 , a&es at @entity149 and @entity150 have already been replaced by downgraded units , while @entity153 ’s @entity5 will close next year			1
in @entity155 , @entity156 , there is a growing campaign to reinstate the @entity5 ward closed four years ago			1
and the @entity5 at either @entity159 or @entity160 in the @entity161 will be closed , with no decision on which made yet			1
nearby @entity163 already only has a minor injuries unit after its @entity5 was closed down , but it could now lose this too			2
@entity1 chiefs say : ‘ this change is being led by clinicians , who have said that doing nothing about the @entity5 situation is not an option			1
the proposed changes will improve patient safety and quality of service			0
’ acute medical services at @entity177 hospital in @entity178 were moved to @entity179 and @entity180 last month			0
although not strictly an @entity5 department , the unit could have treated heart attacks and strokes			2
three other hospitals stand to lose the ability to treat major trauma cases such as car accidents , effectively downgrading the departments			0
the policy is designed to centralise specialist services , but many critics fear it is risking lives			0
retired nurse @entity195 , 65 , used to work at @entity196 in @entity197 , which lost its capacity to deal with trauma cases four years ago			0
she said : ‘ ambulance staff have told me that some patients did n’t make it as they had to be taken the 15 miles to @entity202			0
’ a hospital which complained that a @entity32 article was ‘ seriously misleading ’ for reporting its casualty unit ’s future was in doubt has been forced into a u-turn			1
@entity210 ’s @entity5 department has been closed between 10pm and 8am since last december – a move it originally said was temporary			1
but now bosses have had to cancel plans to reopen it at night , forcing about a dozen patients to travel long distances to alternatives every day			0
backtracked : @entity218 has reneged on a plan to reopen its @entity5 when we launched our campaign in july , we said the department ’s long - term future was doubtful , prompting a hospital spokeswoman to demand a correction , saying : ‘ we are planning to reopen our @entity5 overnight from october			1
’ but that plan has now been permanently shelved after the gp - led clinical commissioning groups , which cover the hospital ’s area , said they were concerned about the @entity5 ’s ‘ sustainability ’			1
the hospital has a £ 46.6 million deficit , and a spokeswoman refused to rule out the possibility of the @entity5 closing altogether			2
@entity235 , chief executive of the hospital trust , said in a written statement : ‘ we will not reopen against their wishes , but will work with them to provide alternatives			0
’ the hospital spokeswoman was ‘ unavailable ’ to comment about her earlier complaint			0
additional reporting : @entity245 and @entity246			0
