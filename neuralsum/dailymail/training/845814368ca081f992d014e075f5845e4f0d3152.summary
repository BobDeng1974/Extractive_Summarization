a goldfish feared dead after a horrific housefire has been found alive and well after nearly two years in an abandoned pond with no food or daylight			1
smokey the fish was found by contractors who had been tasked with filling in the garden pond as part of the clean - up after the 2011 blaze in @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity14 and @entity15 lost all but the clothes on their backs in the fire , which destroyed their and four neighbouring homes , and were delighted to find that one of their goldfish had made it to the other side			1
miracle fish : owner @entity26 thought @entity27 had perished in the blaze , however the goldfish was found alive and well having survived 21 months without food and daylight despite spending 21 months underneath a thick plastic sheet with no fresh food , @entity27 has grown from just one to three inches long , and has been returned to his delightful owners			1
mr and mrs @entity26 thought they had lost all their precious goldfish in the december 2011 fire			2
following the fire , @entity14 's @entity39 , worth more than £ 3,000 , were removed from the pond and had to be re-homed as the couple had no way of caring for them			0
@entity27 has been returned to his owners and although he no longer has a pond all to himself , he is now fed daily in his cosy aerated tank			2
experts have been stunned by the goldfish 's survival and believe he may have gone into hibernation , using a tiny amount of energy to survive			0
burning streets : the 2011 fire destroyed four homes on the @entity26 's street in @entity13 , and left more than 20 people homeless shock find : the destruction on the @entity12 street , pictured at the time of the blaze , saw @entity64 and @entity26 empty their pond and re-homing their £ 3,000 worth of @entity68 - but @entity27 was left behind something fishy : the pond , pictured with @entity27 circled in red , was set to be emptied by contractors when the crew discovered the surviving lone goldfish @entity14 , 60 , said : ‘ we thought we had caught all the fish from the pond - there was only an inch of water left in there - so i was amazed when we were told what had happened			1
‘ when i got the phone call to say there was a surviving fish from the old pond , i thought somebody was winding me up			2
pleasant surprise : @entity14 lost everything in the fire in 2011 , and is happy to have been reunited with @entity27 ‘ it ’s really nice to have @entity27 as it was a horrible experience for us to lose our house and have to re-home all our other fish			1
’ @entity14 , a part - time cleaner , added : ‘ it really has been a traumatic time since the fire - the blaze ripped through the house so quickly you would not believe it and i lost personal belongings that meant so much to me			0
‘ getting @entity27 back has really lifted our spirits - i could not believe it when i saw him			0
i think he must have survived on little insects and algae in the pond			0
’ her husband @entity107 , 71 , a retired lorry driver , said : ‘ it was a real surprise to hear that the goldfish had survived			0
‘ we had given away the other goldfish after the fire but now we got the call to say that @entity27 had been found after all this time			1
’ professor @entity113 , a biologist from the @entity114 , said @entity27 ’s story exemplified the remarkable survival instincts of fish			2
‘ fish , especially cold water species like goldfish , are able to shut down physiological processes to a minimum and go into hibernation when they need no food			2
‘ they keep themselves on trickle charge by living off internal fat and protein reserves laid down during times of plenty			0
' and an @entity134 spokeswoman said : ‘ fish require oxygen in the water to breathe so it ’s quite a surprise that @entity27 has survived so long in a covered - over pond with no obvious source of aeration			1
‘ however it may be that there was just enough in the water for him to survive until now			0
it ’s lucky that he has been found as it ’s likely that the build - up of waste products and carbon dioxide in a covered - over pond would eventually kill a fish			0
