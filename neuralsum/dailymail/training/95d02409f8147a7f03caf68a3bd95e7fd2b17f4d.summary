by @entity0 for the @entity1 ' ugly ' : @entity2 showed that 46 per cent of 16 - year - old girls enjoy being active - but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear			1
( @entity8 picture ) plenty of youngsters will admit that @entity12 is their least favourite part of the school day			0
but for the girls , it seems this reluctance has little to do with exercise – and everything to do with their outfits			0
nearly half of teenage girls would be happy to play more sport if their school pe kits were n’t so ‘ ugly ’ , a poll has found			1
the research showed that 46 per cent of 16 - year - old girls enjoy being active – but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear			1
and 39 per cent of younger girls , aged eight to 16 , said the same thing			0
one pupil told researchers : ‘ my @entity12 kit ’s uncomfortable and a little bit small – i do n’t like myself in it			0
’ another said : ‘ if you ’ve got something you do n’t like wearing , or you think does n’t look nice , you do n’t really want to do any sport in it			0
’ nearly half of girls also admitted to making up excuses to get out of doing sports classes , and more than a quarter of 16 - year - olds said they feel ugly when they play sport , according to the study by health club chain @entity49			1

the winner , 13 - year - old @entity63 , swapped the traditional @entity12 kit – with its low - cut v - necked polo shirts , unflattering skirts and uncomfortable materials – for a more modern design featuring leggings , high - necked collars and dark colours that hide sweat patches			1
@entity63 said : ‘ i enjoy exercise and know it is good for me but sometimes my school @entity12 kit made me feel very self - conscious			2
’ one pupil who tried the winning design said : ‘ you just feel more confident about your body and i think that ’s really important because you do n’t want to be worrying about what other people are thinking of you			0
’ @entity82 , managing director of @entity49 , said : ‘ this winning @entity12 kit design is just the starting point , showing what makes girls feel confident			0
‘ @entity49 is now calling for schools , politicians and pe kit manufacturers to listen to these findings and consider incorporating them into the @entity12 kits of the future , so that more young girls feel engaged with being active in their everyday lives			2
’ old - fashioned : young girls said they disliked the low - cut v - necked polo shirts and uncomfortable materials of traditional pe kits - instead they wanted a more modern design featuring leggings and dark colours			1
