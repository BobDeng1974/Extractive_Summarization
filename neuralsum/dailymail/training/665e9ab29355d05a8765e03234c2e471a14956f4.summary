there may not be much cause for cheer at @entity3 of late , but at least @entity4 can celebrate achieving a feat which eluded his predecessor this term			0
three times @entity8 failed to beat lowly @entity10 — the third a humbling 3 - 2 reversal in the @entity13 semi-final			1
that capitulation from 2 - 0 up with 13 minutes to play sparked @entity15 for @entity8 , but @entity4 ’s men went some way to making amends by grinding out a scrappy , 1 - 0 win , courtesy of @entity22 ’s first - half strike			1
@entity22 celebrates scoring the winner for @entity24 against @entity10 on saturday the forward struck in the 14th minute in what turned out to be the only goal of the game @entity10 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity4 ; @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 ( @entity34 63mins ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 82 ' ) , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity40 subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 @entity24 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 ( @entity53 65 ) , @entity22 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 ( @entity57 83 ' ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ' ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 goals : law 15 ' referee : @entity68 attendance : 3,012 it says a great deal , however , that such a result can be taken as progress			1
before plummeting into financial turmoil , @entity24 were on the brink of achieving four successive top - flight titles			1
in @entity77 on saturday , they only narrowly avoided a rather more ignominious four in a row			0
the visitors were second - best for large stretches of this open contest , which came at the end of another eventful week for the club			2
@entity85 took up his seat at the @entity87 amid growing concerns for his powerbase at @entity3			0
last week , takeover bids were tabled by @entity92 financier @entity91 , while the @entity93 — @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 — snapped up shares as they sought regime change			0
footballing matters were also a source of speculation with @entity102 and @entity103 linked with coaching positions			0
it almost seemed fitting , then , that the latest tumultuous spell should culminate in a clash with their bogey team			0
just six who started in the @entity10 defeat did so here — @entity54 making only his second start of the season — but that december night seemed to play on the visitors ’ minds in the opening exchanges			1
unsurprisingly , @entity10 started the game without fear			1
in the opening minutes , @entity35 even added a touch of samba flair to the chilly surroundings , beating @entity22 with a cheeky backheel			1
and the hosts almost snatched an early lead when @entity40 chipped @entity47 — the ball dropping inches wide of the far post			0
it took @entity24 15 minutes to get the monkey off their backs			1
@entity58 was given space in the area to fizz a low ball across the six - yard box which @entity22 gleefully turned in			1
@entity24 ' @entity58 shields the ball away from @entity10 's @entity30 @entity24 goalkeeper @entity47 makes a fingertip save to keep the ball out yet @entity10 dug in and frustrated their opponents			1
@entity35 and @entity37 proved a handful for @entity54 in the middle of the park , giving the 23 - year - old little time on the ball			2
but , with the snow billowing , @entity24 should have doubled their lead			2
@entity56 raced clear of the @entity10 defence but crashed his shot against the inside of the post			2
the hosts were equally capable of threatening , though , and left - winger @entity38 saw his curling right - footed effort deflected high and wide			0
as @entity24 burst forwards , @entity58 found @entity52 in space on the right of the box but the winger ’s low shot found the legs of @entity154			2
@entity52 then turned provider , picking an excellent through pass to split the @entity159 ’ defence to find @entity56			0
@entity4 once again blocked with his legs to deny the veteran frontman			0
@entity24 pushed in search of a second and @entity56 almost grabbed it in style			2
@entity48 , afforded too much space down the right flank , pumped in a cross which @entity56 met with a cute , backheeled volley which was saved			0
at the back , @entity24 looked suspect and @entity10 sensed an equaliser			1
as the visitors struggled to clear their lines , @entity35 hit a feeble shot from the edge of the box presented at @entity47			0
@entity10 could count themselves unlucky to be behind at the break after @entity33 whipped a dangerous free - kick which narrowly missed the head of team - mate @entity30			1
@entity24 were calmer when play restarted , content to dominate possession and keep their slender advantage			2
@entity4 was eventually called into action on the hour when he fumbled @entity58 ’s 30 - yard piledriver			0
@entity47 was kept busy soon afterwards , though , as @entity38 slid in to beat @entity50 and direct a bobbling effort at the stopper			0
@entity159 boss @entity55 rolled the dice midway through the half by adding an extra striker in @entity191 , @entity24 ’ tormentor - in - chief here last month			1
@entity24 responded by throwing on @entity194 and @entity195 and the latter injected a turn of pace his side were desperately lacking			2
the winger unleashed a powerful right - footed shot which @entity4 parried			0
@entity34 — unbeaten in his career against @entity24 — almost embarrassed the @entity3 men once more , but @entity47 reacted superbly to save his thunderous 30 - yard free - kick at the death			1

@entity22 scores 14th - minute winner for @entity24 against @entity10
@entity8 failed to beat the *minnows* in three attempts as manager
