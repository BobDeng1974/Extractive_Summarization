in a dramatic phone call , the family member of @entity10 flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered investigators to have another look			1
now after further tests revealed mr @entity10 , 46 , of @entity17 's @entity16 , died due to cyanide poisoning his body is set to be exhumed - so his final meal can be examined			1
@entity1 can also reveal that according to a respected poison expert , mr @entity10 would have ingested the killer dose no more than an hour before he died			1
his body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal fateful purchase : @entity10 spent $ 60 in june on two @entity33 state lottery tickets			1
the second one of which proved to be a winning ticket habit : @entity10 was revealed to have spent up to $ 600 a day on scratchcards according to a police report cited by the @entity40 , that fateful day mr @entity10 arrived at his @entity17 home with his wife @entity42 , and daughter , @entity44 and ate some dinner			1
he then went to bed before waking up screaming as his body was ‘ suffocated cell by cell ’			1
mr @entity10 , a hardworking immigrant who ran a laundry business , won $ 1m on the @entity51 last june but just a day after he collected his winnings on july 21 he died			1
the initial examination by the @entity55 medical examiner found he had died of heart disease , or natural causes			0
drugs like cyanide do not show up on standard toxicology reports			0
however , after the intervention of a relative , a more thorough toxicology report was ordered			0
the cause of death has now been ruled as poisoning by cyanide and it is being treated as a homicide by @entity17 police			2
entrepreneur : @entity10 emigrated to the @entity71 during the 1980s , and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops ( pictured ) on @entity17 's @entity74 side @entity55 medical examiner @entity75 told @entity1 : ‘ i believe they called up and said they wanted to us to look into it further			1
‘ they did n’t accept it was going to be a natural death			2
’ mr @entity75 added that he hopes to exhume mr @entity10 ’s body within ‘ the next few weeks ’ from @entity17 ’s @entity84 and that an analysis of the content of his stomach could take place afterwards			1
mr @entity75 said : ‘ i have had one cyanide death in 4,500 autopsies so they are unusual , as are exhumations			2
to have a case where there is both is very unusual ’			0
mr @entity10 emigrated to the @entity71 during the 1980s from @entity95 , and through hard work and discipline , saved up enough cash to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in @entity17			1
last june he paid $ 60 for two lottery scratch - off tickets at a 7 - 11 convenience store near his home and , upon scratching the second one , reportedly leaped in the air and shouted , ' i hit a million ! ' days later , with his wife and daughter at his side at the same store , mr @entity10 gleefully accepted an oversized , mock check from lottery officials			1
at the time , he said he was going to use the money to pay bills , donate to @entity116 in @entity17 and grow his dry - cleaning business			1
after taxes , the prize money amounted to $ 425,000			2
the day after receiving a check for his winnings , @entity10 awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his @entity17 home ( pictured )			1
an expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you ' cell by cell ' no signs of foul play : an initial autopsy on @entity10 performed by the @entity135 found nothing awry @entity51 spokesman @entity137 said that it was eventually cashed august 15 and that if a lottery winner dies , the money typically goes to his or her estate			1
he had recently returned to @entity17 from the hajj pilgrimage to @entity144 inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once			2
his @entity148 faith dictates that he should not even have been gambling in the first place			0
@entity150 , 51 , the manager of the 7 - 11 store where mr @entity10 bought the ticket , said that in 2011 mr @entity10 became ‘ addicted ’ to scratchcards and used to come in every day spending up to $ 600 a time			1
he said : ‘ mr @entity10 would buy an entire book of scratchcards and would leave them with me the next morning and ask me to work out how much he had won			1
‘ that lasted about two months then he realised he had to slow down			0
‘ he started getting addicted to it and he said he had to stop as he was a working person and a family man			2
‘ a lot of the times he would come in his wife would come together with him ’			0
@entity166 , a poison expert whose book ‘ @entity169 ’ is being made into a @entity171 tv series , said that mr @entity10 would have been in ‘ absolute agony ’ and likely coughed up blood as he was killed			1
a former chemist , miss @entity166 said : ‘ a good lethal dose of cyanide will kill you in ten minutes			0
a mid range dose and people die within the hour			2
for a poison that ’s pretty fast			2
‘ cyanide poisoning is a nasty death			1
there is an enzyme which allows your cells to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out			0
‘ it suffocates you cell by cell			0
symptoms include seizures , extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest			0
‘ there is something known as a ‘ cyanide scream ’ where your muscles are contracting , so this could be what mr @entity10 ’s relatives heard ’			1
a good man : the cashier at the 7 - 11 where @entity10 bought his fateful lotto tickets said @entity10 was a ' gentle ' man and a ' nice person ' who cared for his family miss @entity166 added that cyanide would have had a bitter taste and that the best way to disguise it would be to put it into spicy food			1
a mere 200mg would be enough to take somebody ’s life , and that could be obtained from pesticides or certain kinds of rat poison			2
historically , money is a ‘ good reason ’ why people poison , miss @entity166 explained			2
she said : ‘ in the 19th century they used to call cyanide ‘ inheritance powder ’ because so many people used it to get their inheritance early			0
‘ people also poison to punish , such as getting revenge on their boss , or to end a relationship that they want out of			0
‘ @entity233 are unique killers because they are never impulsive			0
‘ there ’s always an element of calculation , and they think they will get away with it - just as nearly happened in this case			0
’ repeated calls to ms @entity42 went unanswered			0
she has told the @entity40 : ' by @entity242 's grace , he was a workaholic			0
' day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7			0
' he made the clients happy by doing his job			0
he could not be everywhere , but he had to be everywhere			0
' @entity248 spokeswoman @entity247 confirmed the department was now investigating the death			0
