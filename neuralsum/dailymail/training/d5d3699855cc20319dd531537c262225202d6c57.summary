it 's a sight many traveller longs to see			0
and this incredible time - lapse video reveals just how spectacular the @entity3 really is			1
filmed in @entity5 at the weekend , the entrancing 37 - second footage shows green lights dancing and flashing across the sky			1
stunning display : the video of the @entity3 was captured in @entity5 the varying green hues of the @entity3 are both captivating and mysterious as they dance majestically through the sky			1
the latest @entity3 display was created after a solar blast on friday , september 12			1
as a result of the blast a large amount of clouds , which were made up of magnetically charged particles , were pushed towards @entity19			2
although green was the primary colour during this recent @entity3 display in @entity5 , varying colours such as pinks , reds , blues and yellows are also frequently visible during displays			1
magnetic green curtains : the attractive green waves almost resemble curtains as they dance in the sky the colours are created during a process known as a coronal mass ejection which is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields			1
there are two types of @entity39 - @entity3 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity42 ’ , known as ‘ dawn of the south			1
’ they are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity19 ’s atmosphere			0
these so - called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the @entity19 ’s magnetic field			2
usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the @entity19 ’s magnetic field , but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			0
stunning : the northern lights look like a natural fireworks display as a result , @entity39 is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution			2
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			0
shades of red , yellow , green , blue , and violet have also been reported			0
the common , greenish - yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity19			0
rare , red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up , at around 200 miles ( 321km )			0
nitrogen produces blue or purplish - red aurora .			0
