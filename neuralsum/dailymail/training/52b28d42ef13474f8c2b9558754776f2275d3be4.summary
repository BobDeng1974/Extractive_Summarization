with a fresh wave of tension over the threat of @entity6 @entity5 bombers , it 's easy to forget how closely the @entity7 has watched our skies for decades			1
a reminder is these rarely - seen images from the height of the @entity13 , taken by specialist @entity15 photographers and showing bombers , defensive missiles and the strangely beautiful forms they strike in our skies			1
the full - colour photographs were painstakingly collated from the @entity23 archives by aviation historian @entity24 , who wanted to document a time when the world hung on the brink of nuclear war			1
pictured , two @entity33 in flight over @entity35 in 1964 attentive : three men receive instructions from a master signaller after arriving at the officer cadet @entity39 at @entity41 in 1964 history : a navigator - plotter is seen through the window of @entity46 bomber of @entity47 at @entity48 in june 1959 ( left ) , while guided missile fitters check the launcher of a bloodhound mark 1 of 62 ( sam ) squadron at @entity52 in july 1961 ( right ) poised : the traffic control tower at @entity54 on 26 june 1962			2
as most readers can probably tell , the image is staged for the cameras the 160 photographs revealed publicly for the first time in his book , the @entity7 in the @entity13 , 1950 - 1970 , are part of a collection of 10,000 colour photographs taken by a small number of government photographers			1
mr @entity24 has shared the images to show the threat of @entity6 incursion is nothing new			1
@entity71 said @entity72 appeared to be trying to make ' some sort of a point ' which should not be dignified with a large - scale response after two long - range @entity76 , known as @entity77 , had to be accompanied off the coast of @entity79 yesterday			1
' i think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets , the pilots , the systems in place to protect the @entity88 , ' he said			0
mr @entity24 said : ' for the past 65 years , the @entity7 has maintained aircraft on a heightened alert state 24/7 , 365 days a year , ready to intercept any unidentified military or civilian aircraft around the @entity88			1
' though there are now certainly fewer frontline squadrons and aircraft , experience gained during the @entity13 along with increasingly advanced aircraft , mean the @entity7 's current air defences are as capable of responding to a potential threat as they had been in the 1950s and 1960s			1
beauty : a @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity48 , leads four @entity104 during a celebratory flight over fields in april 1968 formation : javelins of @entity109 lined up neatly on the hard surface of @entity111 in july 1956			0
' even at the height of the @entity13 , the armed forces were not immune to cuts , ' mr @entity24 said			1
' a number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period ' ' though the @entity13 is over , the @entity7 still maintains @entity118 at two air stations			2
@entity118 ( @entity120 ) is held at @entity121 in @entity122 , while @entity118 ( @entity123 ) is undertaken at @entity124 , @entity125			0
' mr @entity24 said although some might fear cuts are hitting @entity88 's capability to respond to threats , cuts have always been a reality for peacetime armed forces			2
' even at the height of the @entity13 , the armed forces were not immune to cuts , ' he said			0
' a number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period , each ultimately reducing the number of operational aircraft or front - line squadrons , as priorities changed or technology advanced			0
' in 1956 @entity143 had no more than 600 aircraft within 35 squadrons each with 18 operational aircraft			0
by 1962 , this had reduced to 150 aircraft in 11 squadrons			0
today there are approximately 100 @entity151 in the air defence role , within five front line squadrons and one reserve , each operating an estimated 12 aircraft			0
' @entity6 sorties towards the @entity88 have been a reality ever since @entity159 announced an @entity160 had descended over @entity161			2
@entity24 said : ' for the past few years , @entity118 aircraft have been scrambled on just over one day a month on average			1
of these approximately only a third are in response to @entity6 military aircraft			1
alarm : a ' @entity169 ' missile , which could have been launched within just 15 minutes , in 1961 ( left ) and sunset at @entity171 in 1969 ( right ) secrecy : this eerie photo shows a nuclear thor missile countdown exercise at night at @entity41 , @entity175 , in november 1958 ' as far as i am aware there has been no significant increase in the number of these flight over the years following the end of the @entity13			0
' for @entity183 aircraft to fly within @entity88 airspace during the @entity13 , would have been a dangerous and provocative act , risking a response which could trigger a nuclear war			0
instead they were usually flown on a course close to but outside @entity88 airspace			0
' ' sorties undertaken by the @entity77 along with those of the @entity192 and @entity193 , which together made up the @entity183 's @entity194 and @entity195 , had a number of purposes			0
' some flights were for reconnaissance , to take high and medium altitude photographs of @entity88 ports , bases , cities and coastline			0
' however , the majority of flights then , as they are now , were to both test raf air defences and train their own crews			0
' by flying these sorties , irregularly and with different numbers of aircraft the @entity183 could monitor @entity7 's capability to respond , the number of interceptors launched , when and where from			1
' essentially it was intelligence gathering rather than an aggressive act			0
quite often the pilots of the aircraft would wave or communicate with each other during these intercepts , often to the chagrin of @entity226 officers on board the @entity183 aircraft			0
@entity229 : @entity230 of @entity231 at @entity232 , @entity125 , in 1961			0
the @entity233 would happen the next year easy does it : a @entity237 nuclear missile is carefully raised into place at @entity239 , @entity125 , in february 1963 prepared : armourers load a dummy @entity242 @entity241 into the bomb bay of a @entity244 during @entity245 at @entity246 in 1963 fame : a @entity248 , pictured flying from @entity249 in 1957			0
a valiant was the first @entity88 aircraft to drop an atomic bomb ' though publicly available information is limited , it would be na√Øve to believe that @entity7 operations did not include similar intelligence gathering flights by its bomber force			1
' certainly until the introduction of the @entity262 in the early 1960s , much of @entity260 's reconnaissance of the @entity183 was undertaken by @entity7 @entity264 aircraft			1
' similarly , modified bombers from the iconic @entity266 were flown to collect air samples from around the @entity183 in order to monitor and analyse any nuclear tests undertaken			0
' the collection of pictures can be seen in an online archive and at the @entity23			2
the historian added : ' they record the aircraft daily activities of the men and women of the @entity7 during that dynamic period			1
' a small number were used by the @entity15 and @entity7 in recruitment brochures , and contemporary periodicals and newspaper supplements , but largely these are unknown and have never been seen before			2
colour photos : the images in the @entity23 archives include this one of the radar room at @entity288 , @entity289 , in 1966 shining : a pilot climbs into a @entity291 of @entity292 at @entity293 in 1965 near @entity294 , @entity295 beauty of flight : three @entity230 of @entity298 , carrying @entity237 training rounds , demonstrate a dispersal scramble at @entity239 on 9 august 1963 ( left ) while a @entity301 climbs above the @entity303 countryside in september 1965 ( right ) dramatic : away from @entity88 shores , a @entity305 flies over @entity307 during a flight to @entity309 in july 1960 ' together the photographs portray the air force as it adapted to the combined threats of the @entity13 and the frequent defence cuts of the 1950s and 1960s			1
' as recruitment aids , they encouraged boys to become aircrew or skilled @entity7 tradesmen , both of which had seen a decline during the late 1950s			2
' as a public relations tool , they promoted to the public and politicians the similarities between the @entity7 's vital @entity13 role in defending @entity88 and its successes of the @entity328 , then still in strong popular memory			1
' mr @entity24 said many of the images are still being investigated to understand their subject and context			2
more than 1,000 can be seen on @entity23 's online collection search database and more are released all the time			2
figures from the @entity336 show the number of @entity118 launches in response to @entity6 aircraft so far have not been higher this year than previous years			1
however , there have been reports that @entity260 has been busier in its response over the @entity344 and @entity346 regions escorting @entity6 aircraft			1
hard at work : @entity348 , a photographer with @entity349 , talks with a pilot during @entity351 in 1957 scrambled : squadron leader @entity352 and his crew race towards @entity46 during a demonstration at @entity48 , @entity355 , in 1959 sleek : a @entity357 of @entity358 in flight from former station @entity360 in @entity361 on 16 april 1956 v - bomber : a @entity102 , one of many famed aircraft whose name began with @entity266 , carries a @entity237 practice round during a flight in 1963 tense meeting : @entity183 major @entity369 , the first man in space , at a reception held in his honour by @entity88 's @entity15 on 13 july 1961			0

*fascinating* photographs from @entity23 archives assembled in full colour by historian @entity24
they chronicle history of the @entity7 after @entity328 , showing threat of foreign aircraft is nothing new
