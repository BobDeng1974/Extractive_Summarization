by @entity0 it is said that lightning never strikes twice , which is nonsense or there would be no need for lightning conductors it is said that lightning never strikes twice			2
but scientists have long been puzzled as to how lightning even strikes at all			2
the laws of physics mean it should require a huge electrical current – much bigger than that in a storm cloud – for a lightning bolt to reach the earth			1
now @entity19 scientists believe they have the answer , and it may enable forecasters to predict when a lightning storm is due			1
scientists agree that lightning is caused by ice particles colliding within a storm cloud to create an electric charge			1
but they have been divided on how that charge creates a bolt big enough to reach the ground			0
now researchers at @entity32 have suggested that a stream of high - energy particles pumped out by the sun , known as a solar wind , creates a ‘ pathway ’ needed for lightning to travel			2
they say that the solar wind – in which the particles are propelled from the sun ’s atmosphere at around a million miles per hour – charges the air , meaning a lesser current is needed for a lightning bolt to strike			2
cosmic rays – another source of charged particles from exploding stars on the other side of the @entity51 – are thought to be another trigger for lightning			1
the results could prove useful for weather forecasters , since solar winds synchronise with the rotation of the sun , sweeping into the @entity60 ’s atmosphere at regular intervals			0
as these streams are also tracked by @entity64 , it offers the potential for predicting the severity of dangerous storms weeks in advance			0
dr @entity69 , of @entity32 ’s department of meteorology , said : ‘ getting a lightning bolt to jump through the air requires a much bigger charge than that in stormclouds			0
laboratory tests show that it would require about 150 kilovolts per metre ( kv / m ) to generate lightning , but you would expect to generally see no more than 30 kv / m in a stormcloud			0
‘ we think the high - speed solar wind streams provide just enough charge to trigger a lightning bolt in a cloud that is ready to release one			1
’ he said that the sun ’s rotation means the streams of particles ‘ wash past our planet with predictable regularity ’			0
‘ such information could prove useful when producing long - range weather forecasts , ’ he added			0
how lightning strikes : a what it does guide the particle stream from a solar wind varies in density , temperature and speed in a pattern that is dictated by the sun ’s rotation			1
the researchers analysed @entity107 data on lightning strikes over the @entity19 from 2000 to 2005			1
they compared this with information from @entity64 ’s @entity112 spacecraft , which lies between the @entity113 and the @entity60 and measures solar winds			0
there was an average of 422 lightning strikes across the @entity19 in the 40 days after the arrival of each solar wind , compared with an average of 321 in the previous 40 days			1
the rate of lightning strikes peaked between 12 and 18 days after the arrival of the solar wind			1
scientists hope to eventually use such data , along with weather forecasts , to pinpoint when lightning could strike			2
around 24,000 deaths around the world each year are caused by people being struck by lightning			0
professor @entity132 , co-author of the study published in the journal @entity135 , said : ‘ by increasing our understanding of weather on earth we are learning more about its important links with space weather			0
