@entity0 admits his performances since joining @entity2 have not yet justified his price tag but vows : ‘ you ’ll see my best soon			1
’ the @entity6 under 21 left back endured a difficult night in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity8 , only his third club match following his £ 31million move from @entity11 having picked up a hamstring injury and had questions raised over his fitness			1
the result leaves @entity2 10 points behind @entity18 , who visit @entity20 on sunday and are seen by many as champions - elect			1
but @entity0 insists the title is not a foregone conclusion			1
it ’s a long season so we ’ll have to see what happens , ’ he said			2
‘ we ’re going to work hard this week and be ready for the challenge on sunday			2
it ’s a massive test			2
they ’re flying at the moment			2
’ on his own form @entity0 provided a commendably honest appraisal , having received some criticism over his defensive credentials			1
he was partly at fault for @entity44 ’s opening goal at @entity30 by getting drawn too central trying to win the ball			2
@entity0 , 19 , said : ‘ i know i have n’t been up to my full potential and i think maybe people can see that at the moment			1
they have n’t seen the best of me yet			2
‘ i am trying hard and it ’s about getting used to everything			0
when you come to a club like this it ’s never easy for a young player like me			0
but i ’ll get myself starting soon and put in good performances			0
‘ i would n’t say i ’ve been horrendous but i know i can do much better			0
and i need to do better			0
i ’ve come to @entity2 and i know what they need			1
i ’ve been working hard and the performances will come			0
’ @entity61 will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks @entity2 can win the title @entity0 , who broke into the @entity11 first team two years ago , was told by @entity61 to improve his fitness during pre-season			1
@entity67 also voiced his concerns			0
he had to wait for his debut until @entity70 visited @entity20 last month , and was withdrawn in his next match against @entity72 as a precaution over a knee complaint			0
but during the international break he played 180 minutes as @entity76 beat @entity77 over two legs to progress to @entity79 and that action provided a psychological and physical boost			0
‘ it always helps and the main thing for me was it was two 90 minutes for fitness , ’ he said			0
‘ i feel fit but like i said i have n’t played my best recently			0
hopefully i ’ll come out of it now			0
i think i could still get a bit fitter from working hard in training			0
but i do feel pretty fit in training			0
’ at @entity30 , @entity26 set up @entity2 in a third different formation of the season , having started with a 5 - 3 - 2 system before switching to a midfield diamond			1
@entity2 players look dejected after @entity8 's opening goal at the @entity30 against @entity8 it looked more 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 with @entity97 and @entity98 hugging the wings			1
@entity0 described the formation as 4 - 3 - 3 and insisted it relatively straight - forward to adjust tactics			1
‘ it ’s not too difficult , we had a few days to work on it , ’ he said			1
‘ we did a lot of work based on the 4 - 3 - 3 formation with wide wingers			1
‘ we knew what we had to do against @entity8 but unfortunately we did n’t get the result			1
it ’s definitely two points lost , we ’re @entity2 , we come to win every game			1
‘ it ’s two points lost because we were positive ahead of the game			2
they only had two shots on target ( but scored twice ) and that ’s not good enough for us			0
we ’ll focus hard this week and be ready for the game on sunday			0
’ @entity120 not happy after two lost points			2

@entity0 admits he has not quite lived up to his £ 31million price tag
the 19 - year - old joined from @entity11 as a huge *prospect*
but @entity0 insists we will see the best of him soon enough
