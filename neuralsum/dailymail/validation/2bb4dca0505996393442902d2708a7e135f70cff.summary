@entity0 wields a mascara wand like a pro and knows the exact method for creating the illusion of high cheekbones - but this hot new @entity7 star is only five years old			1
and the precocious make - up expert , from @entity9 , is at the centre of a debate that such a young child should be offering beauty advice in online make - up tutorials			1
not only does the little girl show how to apply eyeliner and foundation , she explains how to use contouring techniques to make noses appear slimmer			2
with her mature delivery she has notched up millions of viewers with tutorials including how to apply special make up to celebrate a romantic occasion like @entity27			0
but while @entity0 has won plenty of praise from those who found her performance cute , much criticism has come from others saying her videos are all part of the pressure for children to grow up too fast			1
one viewer , @entity54 , said : ' why ca n't we let our children be children , why do we have to rush them into being adults before they are ready ? ' you know who wrote that it was ' a perfect example of a sexualization of little innocent children '			0
@entity63 posted that real beauty does n't come with paint on faces and that natural beauty is still the best			0
the criticism has n't stopped @entity0 however , who enthusiastically explains to followers how to put on perfect and long - lasting make - up			1
here wearing a dress inspired by @entity74 's princess @entity73 , @entity0 shows viewers how to apply powder , adding that she 'll also be applying it to her ears , and finishing off the look with a tiara the response to @entity0 's video were reported in @entity83 , which said , ' while many users find it charming , others disagree with a small girl putting on make - up and recording herself			1
' ' with a very natural niceness , the girl explains how to put on make up after putting on a base on the face , on the shadows , eye liner , the lip pencil and even a heart on the cheek			0
the article finishes : ' the post on @entity99 has been shared over 150,000 times and many women say that she does her make - up better than they do , though lots of others disapprove of her putting on make - up so young			0
" the tutorials were filmed by the five - year - old 's aunt @entity107 , who thought they were so cute she posted them online , where they quickly went viral on social media			1
she explained in a @entity99 post that for @entity0 the make - up videos are just ' play ' and she posted them with the permission of the little girl 's mother			1
responding to the negative comments , @entity107 said : ' @entity0 loves showing off and enjoys being on the camera , and as long as she 's having fun and doing it on her own initiative then what is wrong with it ? ' children have always played adult games like pretending to be doctors and nurses , or mummies and daddies , or even fireman or cowboys			2
' so what is wrong with imitating an adult in playing around with make - up ? ' concerns are bound to be raised over @entity0 's attempts to slim her facial features with make - up , in the style of the heavy contouring technique loved by celebrities such as @entity142 @entity0 's tutorials , while based on the videos she has watched online are still a five - year - old 's take on beauty			2
while some instructions are eerily adult , such as her guidance on where to place foundation , others are undeniable humorous			0
' and then let 's get powder on the face and neck and i 'm going to put some in my ears			0
and i 'll take this ( the brush ) and with it you have to do it really hard on the cheeks			0
' concerns are bound to be raised over @entity0 's attempts to slim her features with make - up however , in the style of contouring loved by celebrities such as @entity142			2
in her @entity27 make up tutorial , @entity0 tells her audience , ' with white shadow , we will make the nose smaller and above also white shade and blend well			0
' though the online star quickly reflects her age again , by drawing a heart on her cheek using eyeliner and ending things up with ' and the final touch will get this tiara ! ' ' and then i 'm going to take a little white eye shadow , here , and here , and if you get it too strong like me , you have to diffuse it finely , ' viewers have noted the eerily adult language used by @entity0 in her make - up videos @entity0 's videos mix adult delivery with other , more amusing touches , like drawing a heart on her cheek using eyeliner and wearing bright pink eye shadow with a tiara and princess @entity73 costume			1
