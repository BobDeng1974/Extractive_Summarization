by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 20 february 2013 with a dash of @entity2 , a soupçon of @entity3 , a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of @entity7 , the new ' @entity9 ' cocktail at @entity12 's @entity11 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans			1
but there 's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink : the ' @entity19 ' costs a staggering £ 8,167			1
as a result , the expensive tipple has now been crowned the world 's most expensive cocktail , pushing @entity25 's ' @entity24 ' into second place			1
expensive taste : @entity11 bartender @entity28 puts the finishing touches to a ' @entity9 ' cocktail the hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients , which include @entity34 and @entity35			2
most expensive of the lot is the 1858 @entity38 cognac , which costs £ 99,000 a bottle			2
the cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust , poppy seed essence , rose essence and a little coconut			0
along with deep pockets , those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive , as the drink takes two days to make , thanks to the labour intensive garnish			0
the cocktail it replaced at the top of the most expensive list is the ' @entity24 ' made and sold at the @entity57 in @entity25 's @entity58 for £ 5,500			1
created by longtime mixologist , @entity59 , the drink is based on alcohol that pre-dates both @entity61 and the @entity62			0
among them are a 1778 clos de @entity64 , a 1770 @entity65 , an 1860 @entity66 and two dashes of @entity7 dating from around 1900			0
drink up ! will it be a ' @entity9 ' for owner @entity69 or regular , singer @entity70 ? while @entity11 's offering might not have quite the pedigree of the @entity57 's cocktail , it has certainly made headlines - something the club 's owner , former cricketer @entity69 knows all about			1
the club opened less than two years ago in november 2011 , and @entity69 , never one to miss out on a party , threw a lavish , star - studded bash to celebrate			0
since then , a-listers , including @entity83 , @entity70 and former @entity84 , @entity85 , have flocked through the doors to enjoy the plush surroundings			0
whether or not they 'll splash out on the £ 8,000 ' @entity9 ' remains to be seen .			2

*invented* by @entity11 in @entity12 , the ' @entity9 ' costs £ 8,167
@entity91 is owned by @entity93 cricketer , @entity69
the cocktail knocks @entity25 's ' @entity24 ' off the top spot
