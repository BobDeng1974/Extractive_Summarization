by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:51 est , 20 january 2014 @entity3 : 03:16 est , 21 january 2014 a a donations page set up by the family of a seasoned sky diver who was seriously injured when he lost control of his parachute has paid for his medical bills and then some			1
@entity10 , 31 , fell 12,000 feet tuesday without anything to slow his fall but the parked van he landed on at an estimated 40mph			1
a lack of health insurance led to him paying around $ 33,000 in medical bills until internet samaritans donated more than enough to help defray the cost			1
the donations were made through a @entity22 page that has garnered more than 6,800 members and over $ 80,000 in donations in less than a week			0
skydiver @entity10 who needs emergency on his leg following a horrific skydiving accident in @entity28 mr @entity10 , a father - of - one , was attempting a 12,000ft jump when he lost control of his parachute mr @entity10 's troubles began shortly after jumping out of the plane while 12,000 feet above @entity28			1
he lost control of his parachute due to a faulty steering toggle , and crash landed at roughly 40mph into a parked van			1
mr @entity10 broke both his leg in three places and snapped his arm in half - doctors initially feared he may lose the leg if it was n't operated on immediately			1
the @entity44 native is a sky diving instructor in @entity28 and @entity46 with more than 1,000 jumps under his belt , it was the first time he had an accident of this magnitude			0
his health insurance did not cover the jump due to a quirk in regulations regarding the tour group he was with , according to a relative who posted on the @entity22 page			1
slowly recovering : mr @entity10 shown in an @entity59 hospital after his surgeries ready to go : mr @entity10 being loaded into the plane to @entity59 in agony : the pain momentarily gets the best of the injured skydiver @entity28 doctors said they were unable to pin his limbs together and said he would need to be flown to @entity70 , on an emergency flight			2
this forced him to have to pay about $ 33,000 in medical bills upfront before being airlifted to @entity59 for surgeries to save his leg and repair other damage to his body			1
the @entity82 skydiver 's cousin @entity80 created a @entity22 donations page and reached the fundraising goal within hours			0
what happened next was completely unexpected , the page more than doubled its initial target and raised more than enough to pay for the surgery and follow up care			0
even more astonishing , a @entity91 physical therapist offered free rehabilitation services for the duration of mr @entity10 's recovery , accroding to a post on the @entity22 page			2
mr @entity10 crash - landed into a van at 40mph - breaking both his arm and his leg in tree places an @entity101 showing the skydiver 's femur broken in 3 places ( left ) and the break in his arm ( right ) the skydiver was told by hospital staff in @entity28 he would need Â£ 20,000 for a transfer to @entity59 to have surgery the skydiver pictured falling out of a plane			1
he had recently become a father to a son called @entity115 mr @entity80 , a skydiver himself , said : ' while he was doing the swoop the toggle came out of his hand and he had n't completed the turn			0
' this caused mr @entity10 to spiral out of control and make the crash landing , he is lucky to be alive			1
' i spoke to @entity10 and he was a bit groggy from the drugs he is on but that 's what i could make out , ' mr @entity80 added			2
' his right femur snapped in three places			2
' his left arm between his shoulder and elbow is in half and he has got cuts and bruises and damaged his knee - cap			1
' in @entity28 , they have only got small hospitals			0
they had a look at him but could n't pin and screw that together			0
' in the ambulance : mr @entity10 as he 's taken from the accident to a hospital in @entity28 with his son : mr @entity10 is shown here with his 11 - month - old son friends of the experienced skydiver raised the money in a matter of hours , and he was moved to @entity70 mr @entity153 added : ' his parents have n't got that sort of money , i have n't got that sort of money			1
' i got on @entity22 and spoke to a few skydivers to see if they had any contacts			0
i put up the page where we can all go			0
' now , we have saved his leg and possibly his life			2
' mr @entity10 's ordeal has received widespread media attention around the world , likely leading to the high number of donations			2
being stuck with the full bill would have put a serious crimp in his ability to care for his 11 - month - old son			0
mr @entity10 was due to have surgery last night			0
his family said before the procedure he was doing well mr @entity10 's family are continuing to appeal for money as they are unsure whether he will need further medical care mr @entity80 told the @entity182 : ' the page was set up at about 9pm or 10pm on wednesday			1
i think it was about 16 hours from starting the @entity22 page that we accomplished the ( $ 33,000 )			0
' the guys in @entity59 would n't transport @entity10 until they had the money up front			0
it is actually another , fellow skydiver who paid the ( fees ) up front on my word that i would give him the money back			0
' mr @entity80 said they did not know what the cost of the operation or @entity10 's continued medical care would be , so the fundraising will carry on .			2
