by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 18:10 est , 5 march 2013 many women do not understand what constitutes domestic violence and awareness of the issue is ' shockingly low ' , new research has revealed			1
more than half of 2,000 women aged 16 - 55 either disagreed or did not know if excessive jealousy counted as domestic violence , the survey by commissioned by @entity12 found			1
@entity14 and @entity16 's @entity15 judge @entity13 led a group of women - including survivors of domestic violence and victim 's families - who marched across @entity23 to present the findings at the @entity25 and demand action today			1
@entity14 and @entity16 's @entity15 judge @entity13 leads domestic violence campaigners in a march to the @entity25 campaigners say women 's awareness of domestic violence is ' shockingly low ' ( file picture ) she said : ' one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lives , making it the single biggest issue that will affect young women and their peers in their life			1
' yet the results of this research show that awareness of domestic violence is still shockingly low and that 's why it 's so important that we raise awareness about a subject that is too often ignored			0
' charities including @entity12 , @entity53 and women 's aid want domestic violence to receive the same level of attention as other high - profile issues such as drink - driving			2
the campaigners are demanding action from the government to reduce domestic violence against women the research found around one in five 16 to 18 - year - olds did not think or were unsure if pressure from a partner to have sex or do other sexual things constituted domestic violence , while the same number were unsure if slapping or hitting was a sign of domestic violence			1
nearly half either disagreed or did not know if going through a female partner 's private electronic messages counted as domestic violence			2
just over half either disagreed or did not know whether a partner making all the monetary decisions was domestic violence			2
but more than half of the women questioned said they knew or suspected that someone in their life had experienced domestic violence			1
two women are killed by current or former partners every week in @entity92 and @entity93			1
@entity94 , chief executive of @entity53 , said : ' this issue is still shrouded in myth and misunderstanding			0
the government needs to invest in powerful awareness - raising campaigns to change the attitudes that allow violence and fear to darken so many homes up and down the country			0
' it is essential that unhealthy attitudes and beliefs about violence against women in all professional and public spheres are challenged and addressed too			2
' changing social attitudes is not an add - on			0
it is at the very root of preventing and ending domestic violence			0
' @entity115 , chief executive of women 's aid , said : ' it is terrifying that many young women do not know where to get help if they are experiencing domestic violence , although that is to be expected when so few young people have been taught about domestic violence at school			0
' women 's aid has developed a free downloadable teaching resource , but at the moment it is a choice for schools if they decide to educate about healthy relationships			0
' if we are going to reduce the level of domestic violence in the future , and educate those directly affected now about where they can go for help and support , we need the government to support statutory education about relationships for all young people			0

more than half do not know if excessive jealousy counts
two women killed by current or former partners every day
