' they use bull - hooks and chains on the animals , and handlers sneakily have nails in their hands they hit the elephants with to make they move around the resorts			2
' ms @entity31 said she has been told by sanctuaries and animal rights workers in the area that the resorts do n't own the elephants themselves , and they instead rely on private contractors who ' rent ' the animals out to different places			0
the elephants are bought at a very young age by these groups , so that they can be ' trained ' for the job and are often forced to live in appalling conditions			2
the elephants are also put through a breaking in process called ' @entity68 ' that uses cruel behaviour and negative reinforcement to break its spirit			0
@entity10 launched the online campaign after she saw @entity12 tied up outside a restaurant ( pictured ) at the resort elephants are forced to pose for pictures and be ridden by guests at the resort , and others across @entity33 ' they use bull - hooks and chains on the animals , and handlers sneakily have nails in their hands they hit the elephants with to make they move around the resorts			1
it 's terrifying ' @entity92 in @entity93 published the picture along with a caption that stated it was ' amazing sunday brunch ' ms @entity31 said @entity12 is rumoured to be kept in a tiny enclosure , and does not have any interaction with other elephants			1
she also said a elephant sanctuary has committed to taking @entity12 in if she was released , which would allow the elephant to ' live the life she deserves , surrounded by other elephants , and in the care of those who will love and cherish her			1
' ms @entity31 said she had repeatedly tried to contact the resort since earlier this year , but she it had not replied to any of her calls or emails			2
ms @entity31 said she has been told by sanctuaries and animal rights workers in the area that the resorts do n't own the elephants themselves , and they instead rely on private contractors who ' rent ' the animals out @entity121 's dr @entity120 said this sort of behaviour is a ' far cry from their natural lives in the wild '			0
' when you look behind the scenes , holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty , ' dr @entity120 said			0
animal rights activists slammed the way resorts treat animals , and said tourists should not take part in the behaviour ' this sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view			0
' earlier this year , @entity143 posted a blog criticising @entity145 after the superstar was snapped riding an elephant while on vacation			1
' hi @ @entity145 ! we do n't want to ruin your vacay , but elephant rides are not fun for elephants , ' the company tweeted			2
' hi @ @entity145 ! we do n't want to ruin your vacay , but elephant rides are not fun for elephants , ' @entity143 tweeted ' people often think that an elephant in captivity is domesticated , and so somehow it 's ok to have them under human command , ' the company wrote			0
' but the reality is that [ elephants ] never have been domesticated like dogs or horses			0
even if born in captivity , they are still a wild animal , and need to be " broken " to accept human control			0
' there is much evidence that this process is exceptionally cruel			0
' @entity121 's dr @entity172 said this sort of behaviour is a ' far cry from their natural lives in the wild ' ' when you look behind the scenes , holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty , ' dr @entity120 said one sanctuary in the area has said it would be willing to take @entity12 in , if it 's owners freed her the petition comes after another resort in the island holiday haven was criticised last month for allowing tourists to party with a baby elephant			1

the resort is located about 30 minutes away from the tourist hot - spot of @entity205 @entity92 in @entity93 was flooded with complaints over the photo , reports @entity208			1
people were enraged such a young elephant had been brought onto the property so that guests could ride it for fun , and that guests were more than willing to take part			1
the resort quickly deleted the photo , and released a statement to address the controversy			1
' we would like to make it clear that we do not , have not and will never own an elephant , ' the statement read			0
' the elephant in the photo is from a reputable elephant caretaker who has no affiliation with @entity225			2
' we would like to make it clear that we do not , have not and will never own an elephant , ' a statement from the resort read ' elephants are a highly respected and regarded symbol of @entity33			2
as a global company , @entity225 respects every country 's culture and traditions and as such , we fall into the normal behaviors in usage of elephants to represent their culture			0
' we never intended to be disrespectful			0
' the statement did little to calm the stampeding herd of online protesters , and the anger spilled onto the resort 's @entity244			2
