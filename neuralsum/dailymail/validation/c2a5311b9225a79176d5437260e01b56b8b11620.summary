miss @entity8 , who works as a team leader for the @entity46 , said : ' i 've gained a lot of positives , but the saggy skin is holding me back from my happy ending			1
' i 'd like to have someone to share my life with - and no man can fancy me with all this excess skin			1
i need to get it removed			0
' i 've asked the @entity6 for another funded op - now i just need to hear back from my doctor to see if i qualify			1
' at 16 weeks into her pregnancy , miss @entity8 's relationship with her daughter 's father broke down			1
she said : ' the pregnancy was making me feeling anxious enough , and the breakup was very upsetting			1
i fell into a dip of depression , which i coped with through eating			1

as my weight increased i seemed to be more prone to abscesses under my arms and on my bikini line			0
' friends thought i was bubbly and outgoing , but inside i was finding things really difficult			0
' whenever i found myself in an argument with anyone , my size was the first thing they would pick on , and it really hurt when they did			1
' as people used harsh names , i became more and more reclusive			0
' her depression reached such a state that she was recommended a course of antidepressants by her gp , but she decided against relying on drugs to improve her mood			0
eventually , her doctor suggested that a @entity6 gastric bypass would combat her mounting health problems and attack the route cause of her depression			1
after an assessment she underwent the procedure at @entity132 and @entity133 in september 2010			1
she said : ' before the bypass i 'd tried to lose weight in the gym , but nothing had ever worked			1
' the weight loss after the operation was unbelievable			0
i lost eight stone in a year , and a further two the year after that			0
' instead of spending my evenings gorging on food i got involved in some intense boot camps at my local gym			0
there were moments after a heavy session where i could barely walk			0
' i was exercising five times a week and the pounds were melting away			2
' miss @entity8 , pictured part way through her weight loss ( left ) , and now that she has lost 10 stone ( right ) says her excess skin has left her less confident than when she was overweight she also completely overhauled her diet , further accelerating her weight loss			1
before her operation , she typically ate a greasy bacon , egg and sausage sarnie for breakfast , followed by pie and chips for lunch			0
in the evenings she would tuck into comfort food like beef stew with @entity82 puddings			2
she snacked on crisps and chocolate throughout the day			0

while her physical appearance and general health improved , she found her confidence dipping			2
she said : ' there 's absolutely no question about whether or not i feel healthier , but whether or not i feel more confident , that 's a whole different story			0
' in the past i was confident enough to meet up with men after meeting them on a night out , but i would n't do it again			0
i do n't feel comfortable with my loose skin			2
' now whenever i find myself talking to a man at a bar i always make an excuse to leave early			0
i tend to just say " i 'm with someone else "			0
' when i 'm on holiday i 'll always wear a modest swimsuit			0
i never wear anything tight around my stomach area			0
' miss @entity8 is happy to be healthier after the gastric bypass , but desperately wants the @entity6 to remove the excess skin			1
such a procedure would cost around £ 15,000 at a private clinic she is now waiting for a green light from @entity6 bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline			1
the cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £ 15,000			0
she said : ' my gp has tried to get me funding for the operation four times but every time it has been denied			2
' this is my fifth application for the saggy skin removal op so i am really hoping that i am eligible this time			2
' despite her struggles with low confidence , miss @entity8 said she has gained a lot of positives			1
she said : ' i feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter @entity11 looks up to me			1
i would n't want her to end up like how i did			0
' after weight loss , proteins in skin tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength losing weight is the answer to many people 's prayers			2
but they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side - effect : excess skin			2
this hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin , the dermis , which contains two proteins : elastin , which helps it retract , and collagen , for strength			2
when the skin is stretched too much through weight gain , these proteins tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength			2
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract			1
it is linked unpleasant health problems , from infections to back pain			0
doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body			1
factors that affect how much skin is left include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had			1
many patients patients develop an ' apron ' of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs			2
this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems			2
one of the most common is intertrigo - a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			0
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery .			0
