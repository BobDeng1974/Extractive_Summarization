it has been a key part school chemistry lessons for more than a century , but now the periodic table may need to be redrawn after scientists found a rare element may be very different from originally thought			1
researchers have for the first time been able to test how much energy is required to strip an electron from an atom of the radioactive element lawrencium			1
the rare metal currently sits at the very bottom of the periodic table at the end of a group of elements known as the actinides , which sit in a separate block from the main table			1
but the results of new research suggest the element may have properties similar to sodium and potassium , which may fuel arguments that it would be better placed in the main body the periodic table			1
@entity28 , marked as @entity28 on the periodic table above , currently sits in a separate block from the main table if it is redraw , it means that chemistry students could have to relearn the order of how the elements appear			1
@entity28 , which was first discovered in 1961 by the nuclear scientist @entity36 , is notoriously difficult to make and only exists for a few seconds at a time			1
this has made the element , which can only be generated in particle accelerators , extremely difficult to study			1
there are several newly discovered atoms that currently do not appear on the periodic table			0
two years ago scientists claimed to have discovered the existence of a new atom with an atomic number of 115			0
this makes it one of the heaviest chemical elements detected to date and does not occur naturally			0
instead scientists had to synthesis it in the laboratory by bombarding a film of another heavy element known as americium with calcium ions			0
the resulting element lasted for just a fraction of a second before it decaying into more commonly found elements			2
although still to be officially named , it has been given the temporary name of ununpentium			0
the @entity65 has also recently announced that nineteen elements have had their atomic weights reassessed			0
among those to have had their standard atomic weights adjusted are elements like aluminium , fluorine , arsenic , caesium , cadmium and selenium			0
while some of the atoms were found to have an average weight that was a tiny fraction greater than previously calculated , others decreased			0
overall the total atomic weight displayed on the periodic table increased by 0.003640021 as a result of the changes			0
but now researchers at the @entity87 have been able to create enough to measured the ionisation potential of lawrencium for the first time			2
speaking to @entity96 world , @entity91 , a researcher at the @entity92 who took part in the study , said : ‘ [ @entity97 and lawrencium ] – the last column of lanthanides and actinides – could be put into the group iii column of the periodic table , under scandium and yttrium			2
’ the current structure of the periodic table was drawn up in 1945 after the nobel - prize winning chemist @entity107 suggested the actinides - rare radioactive elements - belonged in a separate part of the table which is known as ' f - block '			1
however , some chemists have argued that placing lawrencium at the end of this block was incorrect and they should be put in the 'd - block ' of the main table			1
dr @entity120 , a chemist at the @entity121 , argues that along with lutetium , lawrencium is misplaced in the f - block			1
in a paper published in the journal @entity126 last month , he said : ' though there are many misconceptions concerning the nature and function of the periodic law and table , perhaps the most prevalent among modern chemists is the belief that the periodic table is nothing more than an electron configuration table			0
' while there is certainly a significant correlation between electron configurations and chemical periodicity , the correlation is far from perfect			0
' @entity97 and lawrencium , rather than @entity144 and @entity145 , should be assigned to the d - block as the heavier analogs of @entity148 and @entity149 , whereas @entity144 and @entity145 should be considered as the first members of the f - block with irregular configurations			1
' @entity28 , represented by the diagram left , was discovered by nuclear scientist @entity36 ( right ) @entity28 was first generated by @entity36 by bombarding californium atoms with boron atoms to create the new superheavy element			0
however , scientists have only ever been able to produce minuscule amounts of the substance and it has a half life of 27 seconds			1
the new study , which is published in the journal nature , used the same approach as @entity36 to create the element that bears his name but captured it in a helium and cadmium iodide gas			0
this was passed through a heated tantalum surface giving the short - lived lawrencium enough energy to shed its outer electron - the ionisation potential			2
the researchers found this matched a recent prediction of @entity179 - giving it the lowest ionisation potential of all elements in the f - block			1
this representation of the periodic table shows the ionisation potential of elements following the new results however , in a statement , the @entity87 said it did not feel it affected the structure of the periodic table			2
they said : ' since the introduction of the ' actinide concept ' as the most dramatic modern revision of the @entity198 by @entity107 in the 1940s , the element with atomic number 103 , lawrencium ( @entity28 ) , played a crucial role as the last element in the actinide series			2
' we show that removing the outermost electron requires least energy in @entity28 among all actinides , as was expected			0
@entity207 ' this validates the position of @entity28 as the last actinide element and confirms the architecture of the @entity198			0
' however , dr @entity212 , a chemist and historian at the @entity214 , said the results supported the push to move lawrencium into the min part of the table			2
he said : ' if the periodic table is presented in the more correct 32 - column or long - format , and if one maintains the order of increasing atomic numbers throughout the table , one is inevitably led to the conclusion that @entity97 and @entity28 belong to group 3 and that @entity144 and @entity145 should be placed at the start of the f - block elements			1
' despite the debate the result is likely to now generate , professor @entity229 , a chemist at the @entity230 at the @entity231 , @entity232 , described the experiment as ' spectacular '			0
the researchers were able to study lawrencium for the first time using an ionizer cavity ( left ) which revealed that the element has one of the lowest ionisation potentials of any of the atoms in the f - block ( right )			1

the @entity87 has studied lawrencium for the first time
the element is extremely difficult to make and has a half life of 27 seconds
they found it is different from other rare radioactive elements in the f - block
it is likely to fuel the debate for lawrencium to be in the main body of table
