sir @entity1 lines up for the start of the @entity3 in @entity4 on sunday , bidding to defend the title he won 12 months ago in a race which has been more competitive each year			1
@entity8 's @entity7 has the opportunity to show himself on home roads after missing out on selection for a @entity13 which began in @entity14 , although his priorities are gradually shifting to the track ahead of the @entity17 in 2016			1
if @entity7 , the @entity19 winner , can stay in contention over the tumble on tuesday 's third stage , the lumpy fifth @entity24 stage and the penultimate day 's route to @entity26 , which includes the brutal ascent of @entity28 , the gold jersey could be his once more			2
aiming for gold : sir @entity1 is aiming to retain his tour of @entity32 title the split final day 's first test - an 8.8 - kilometre time - trial in @entity35 - is not entirely to @entity7 ' strengths , but he is a fine exponent against the clock and could gain time			1
other contenders include the @entity42 's @entity41 ( @entity43 ) , @entity45 's @entity44 ( @entity46 ) , the @entity48 time - trial champion , @entity50 @entity49 ( @entity51 ) , @entity53 @entity52 ( @entity54 ) and @entity56 @entity55 ( @entity57 ) in a race which offers few opportunities for the sprinters			1
@entity61 ( @entity62 ) , who is still recovering following his @entity13 - ending crash in @entity64 , will go head to head with rival @entity66 ( @entity68 ) in @entity4 and @entity35 , on september 14 , in the circuit races which bookend the 1376.7km , eight - day race			1
" realistically you have to say that i am not in my best condition after the last few months i 've had , " @entity61 said on tourofbritain.co.uk after requiring shoulder surgery following his crash in @entity14			2
" i 'm racing this week because this is my national tour , @entity32 's big race , and i always want to support it when i can			2
bouncing back : @entity61 has a point to prove after crashing out of the @entity13 " it 's always a treat racing on home soil in front of big @entity32 crowds			1
i 'm just going to enjoy myself and see what the week brings			0
" the @entity86 is a prolific winner but will end 2014 without a @entity88 stage success for the first time since his first year as a professional in 2007			0
just as it is difficult to predict his own prospects , @entity61 knows the race is wide open and tough to call			0
" it 's a really strong field at the @entity3 this year , the best ever , " he said			0
" it 's going to make for really intense racing but i do n't think it will change the nature of the race			0
" looking at the route it seems to be bookended by the two sure - fire sprints but after that almost anything can happen and that keeps a lot of riders interested			0
" a lot of scenarios are possible			0
