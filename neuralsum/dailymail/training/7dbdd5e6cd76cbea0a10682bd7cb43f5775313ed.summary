a @entity0 mp who has questioned the existence of @entity2 was suspended from the party yesterday			0
@entity4 will have the whip withdrawn until @entity6 returns in september after branding @entity2 an ' apartheid state '			1
but the punishment - after mr @entity4 repeatedly condemned @entity2 and ' the @entity9 ' more widely - was condemned by @entity9 groups as an ' empty gesture ' that is ' too little , too late '			1
mp for @entity13 @entity4 ( left ) pictured with deputy prime minister @entity14 ( centre ) has been suspended over comments questioning the continued existence of the state of @entity2 the offensive @entity19 was still available to read on @entity4 's @entity19 feed last night @entity0 chief whip @entity21 kicked mr @entity4 out yesterday over a tweet in which the @entity13 mp said : ' am i wrong or are am i right ? at long last the # zionists are losing the battle - how long can the # apartheid state of # @entity2 last ? ' that outburst came after four previous warnings from the party leadership that he use ' proportionate and precise ' language when discussing @entity2			1
mr @entity21 said mr @entity4 's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way that has ' caused offence ' and made it more difficult for the @entity0 to make legitimate criticism of @entity2 's settlement building in @entity40 areas			2
mr @entity4 's difficulties with the party leadership began over a posting made on his website after signing a memorial book to mark @entity46 in january			1
@entity0 chief whip @entity21 said mr @entity4 's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way that has ' caused offence ' he wrote that he was ' saddened that the @entity9 , who suffered unbelievable levels of persecution during the @entity46 , could within a few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on @entity40 in the new state of @entity2 and continue to do so on a daily basis '			1
but despite repeated warnings to tone down his language , mr @entity4 refused			2
following a meeting with @entity0 leader @entity14 and his deputy @entity59 , mr @entity21 yesterday wrote to mr @entity4 saying : ' we put it to you that your most recent statement - which specifically questions the continuing existence of the @entity2 - is neither proportionate nor precise			0
' we considered your explanation to be unconvincing			0
these interventions cause considerable offence rather than addressing questions of political substance about the plight of the @entity40 people and the right of @entity2 's citizens to live a life free of violence			0
@entity77 , vice president of the @entity78 said the suspension is not enough			0
he said : ' we note that the @entity0 have at last taken some action to address the completely inappropriate and offensive comments that he has made			0
however , suspension of the whip for just two months when @entity6 is not sitting is too little , too late			2
it is a token and frankly an empty gesture			2
' @entity86 , chief executive of the @entity87 said : ' @entity4 has never fully apologised for his comments , which deliberately abused the memory of the @entity46 and caused deep pain and offence			0
' although i welcome the withdrawal of the whip , the decision to do so comes months too late and allows mr @entity4 to repeat his unacceptable views when @entity6 returns in the autumn			1

@entity4 will have whip withdrawn until @entity6 returns in september
@entity19 outburst came after four previous warnings from the party leadership
punishment has been condemned by @entity9 groups as an ' empty gesture '
