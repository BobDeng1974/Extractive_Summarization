@entity0 says she thinks she 's ' fabulous ' i sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full - length bedroom mirror , and i can honestly say that there ’s never a day when i would rather be someone else			1
the woman looking back at me ? she ’s gorgeous , intelligent and fabulous ! quite simply , i adore who i am – inside and out			0
i ’m no narcissist – i ’m perfectly aware i have flaws , but they ’re deliciously wrapped up in the very unique moi			0
i ’ve grown to love my nose that tilts ever so slightly to the right , my hourglass figure that boasts slightly - too - large hips , and my green - sometimes - grey eyes			2
i ’m a size 10 , but even so i could do with dropping 10lbs			0
but as long as i do n’t mind , who cares ? which is why i ’m utterly peeved about @entity21 's latest campaign results			1
how humiliating to film women in a public place ‘ choosing ’ to walk through a door marked either ‘ beautiful ’ or ‘ average ’			1
talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot			0
it 's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the ' average ' option			1
from my experience , most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than freely admit that not only are they good - looking , but they ’re also ( whisper it ) beautiful			1
why is this ? numerous university studies have been carried out ( i know this because their authors send them to me ) and they have all come up with the same conclusion – it ’s self - protection			1
if women do n’t fit in with their ( usually older , fatter , less attractive ) female peers , then those who are good - looking wo n’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex ; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they ’ll routinely receive their @entity51 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile			1
and this is what really exasperates me : it is n’t society that wo n’t let us admit that we ’re beautiful – it ’s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back			2
even though i ’m an @entity62 , un-surgically enhanced 44 - year - old , i would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought			1
i ’m extremely comfortable in my skin			0
haters : @entity0 has received death threats for standing up and saying ' i 'm beautiful ' this confidence annoys the heck out of other women			1
you might have read what i ’ve written about this problem , in an article published in april 2012			2
it received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly i was a global name			0
the earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting : ‘ i like how i look and other women have a problem with it			1
’ since then i ’ve been ridiculed , received death threats , told i ’m off my rocker			0
just last week i received yet another email from a woman titled ‘ please read me ’ which went on at length to tell me i was ‘ an arrogant , cocky woman ’			0
little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked ' beautiful ' in the @entity21 campaign			1
critical : @entity0 claims @entity21 's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly my personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple : we ’d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow ' fairer ' sex any more ammunition than we 've got already against each other			1
my view is supported by the thousands of emails i ’ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated , bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good			2
the emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world			0
whether they ’re teenagers at school in the @entity120 , middle - aged mums in @entity114 or women in the workplace in the @entity117 : if they rate themselves , display confidence , or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised			1
a recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this : ‘ i have just looked up your article , it ’s my life in black and white			1
i tried dressing down , not wearing too much make up , unfashionable clothes and flat shoes			0
reaching out : @entity0 receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful ' i am confident and friendly , men open doors for me , they are polite			1
but some women are awful to me as a result of it			2
' i am fed up with it , angry about it , annoyed with it			0
i feel like a complete nothing and nobody ; maybe that ’s what i should be to be accepted			0
’ another woman was banned by her mean - minded ( older ) female boss for wearing heels to work : they were a ‘ health hazard ’			2
what health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist ? the mind boggles			0
how awful that these women are treated this way			2
it 's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good - looking , which is ironic because so many do it in private – behind the anonymity of social media			2
we know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as @entity166			0
we can iron out wrinkles , banish zits , magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip			0
in the @entity21 campaign , women were asked to choose between a door marked ' beautiful ' or ' average ' yet to admit to the world ‘ yeah , i look good ’ means we risk incurring the wrath of other women			1
we have to be display modesty at all times - which is why @entity21 's campaign works brilliantly			1
i ’m not some superior @entity181 female who does n’t recognise that there are some who do n’t feel happy about themselves			0
yet such feelings of low self - esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth			2
any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence			0
ironically , they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others is n't the way to go about it			0
in 2015 , we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they ’re beautiful - and not fear reprisals			1
otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has ' beautifully ' done .			0

author of ' why women hate me for being beautiful ' article speaks out
the 44 - year - old is ' utterly peeved ' by the ' exploitative ' dove campaign
@entity0 claims women 's need for modesty is down to self - protection
