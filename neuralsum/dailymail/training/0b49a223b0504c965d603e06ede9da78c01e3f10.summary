@entity1 ’s comeback king @entity0 , one of the so - called ‘ @entity2 ’ of high - earners that owner @entity4 wanted out of @entity5 , has admitted he thought he would never play for the club again			1
@entity0 , 29 , was one of @entity1 ’s stand - out performers in their impressive 1 - 0 win at @entity9 on saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround in his fortunes			1
the @entity12 international has spent the last two seasons on loan at @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 after manager @entity19 was ordered by @entity4 to trim the wage bill by getting @entity0 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 out of the club			1
back in business : @entity0 , playing his first @entity29 match for 27 months , impressed in @entity1 's 1 - 0 win at @entity9 on the opening day of the season perfect start : @entity34 settled the contest at the @entity36 comeback : @entity38 , another member of the so - called ' bomb squad ' of high owners @entity4 wanted out of the club , featured against @entity9 @entity34 ’s winner means he has already equalled the tally of goals he scored outside @entity5 last season			1
his only away strike in 2013 - 14 came in a 2 - 2 draw against @entity48 last season			2
but with the @entity50 now wanting to sell the club , there has been a u-turn in policy and @entity0 and @entity24 played at @entity54 with given on the bench			2
it was full - back @entity0 ’s first @entity29 game for 27 months and he picked up a customary yellow card , for time - wasting rather than his trademark thumping tackle , as if he ’d never been away			1
‘ it was a second debut for me			2
it was unbelievable to go away to @entity9 and get the three points			2
brilliant , ’ he said			0
‘ to be honest , i did n’t see this happening			0
all i did was try to work hard and hope the chance would come			2
‘ i ’ve been on loan to @entity66 and the @entity67 — that was down to wanting to play football			0
i ’m not one of those players who is just happy sitting there			0
‘ any opportunity i had to go and play , i was going to take it			0
’ push on : villa manager @entity19 issues instructions to @entity0 during the match described by the player as a ' second debut ' after so long away from the team @entity81 move : @entity0 ( left ) spent a spell on loan at @entity17 last year @entity1 ’s struggles over the past couple of seasons persuaded @entity4 to let his manager pick the most expensive players in his squad again — including those he previously wanted bombed out because they had been signed during the @entity90 and @entity91 years he has come to regret			1
after @entity34 ’s 50th - minute winner , cheered from sidelines by @entity19 ’s famous new no 2 @entity94 , the manager tried to explain @entity0 ’s long absence			1
‘ everybody knew the finances were spiralling and we had to draw a line under it , ’ he said			0
’ it was the case with @entity0 and a few of the lads			2
‘ but we move and if they ( @entity0 and @entity24 ) keep playing like that , they will be fine			2
‘ @entity0 was outstanding , i thought the whole back four were			2
he has always been a really top pro. even when he was out of the side there were never any cross words or anything			0
’ @entity1 ’s deserved opening - day win matched their success at @entity115 a year ago			1
on that occasion , the promise evaporated quickly but this time @entity0 believes it will be different particularly with star striker @entity118 due to return from an achilles injury in october and @entity121 international @entity120 signing last week from @entity122			1
winning start : @entity19 with assistant @entity94 in the dug - out at the @entity36 exciting signing : @entity19 is pleased to have @entity121 international @entity120 on board ‘ it ’s a clean slate for everybody , ’ said the right - back			1
‘ everybody is being given a go and everybody has worked really hard over the pre-season			0
‘ i think people will be quietly surprised			0
they shot us down every early but you ’ve seen us here and we did well going forward and at the back			0
’ @entity9 ’s optimism after signing six new players including @entity139 ’s @entity138 was pricked by being second - best to @entity1			1
in the end , they were forced to send on @entity143 and resort to route one to try and grab an equaliser			0
manager @entity145 , who incurred a glare from his former @entity147 team - mate @entity94 when he expressed his displeasure about @entity1 time - wasting , hopes the loan signing of @entity151 from @entity152 on saturday will help his team recover			1
quiet debut : @entity9 's new signing from @entity139 @entity138 was n't able to impact on the game plan b : in the end , @entity9 brought on @entity143 in their search for an equalising goal @entity9 moved for the left - sided @entity151 after failing to agree personal terms with @entity48 ’s @entity162 and @entity145 said : ‘ we ’re pleased we ’ve been able to bring him in			1
that ’s probably all our business done now			0
‘ we feel he ’s a player who can give us pace and power which we probably lacked a bit on saturday			0
he ’s a young man who obviously has n’t played a great deal over the last couple of years			0
‘ he wants to play games and that ’s the opportunity he will get here			0
’ @entity145 ’ top priority in the coming weeks will be how to get the best out of @entity138 who found his opening @entity29 game a culture shock and contributed little after an early turn and shot which hit the side - netting .			1

@entity0 was one of six players branded the ' bomb squad ' by @entity1 owner @entity4 because they earned too much money
but the @entity12 international impressed on his return to @entity29 action after 27 months as @entity1 beat @entity9 1 - 0
@entity0 described the match as a ' second debut ' afterwards
@entity38 has also been given a second chance by @entity19
@entity34 scored the *decisive* goal in @entity1 's win
@entity9 's new signing from @entity139 , @entity138 , had a quiet debut
