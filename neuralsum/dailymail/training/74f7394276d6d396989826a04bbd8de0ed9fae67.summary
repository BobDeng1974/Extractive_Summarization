when dusk descends each evening on this sleepy suburban hamlet , it 's mob rule on the streets - mobs of kangaroos each lorded over by an ' @entity6 '			1
just over 100km north of @entity9 's central business district , the quiet township has a population of 500 people and 200 kangaroos , with the marsupials growing faster than the humans and taking right of way			2
but the residents of of tiny @entity17 , in @entity18 , @entity19 , about an hour and a half north of @entity9 , did not think anything of their kangaroo mobs or regular evening encounters with the marsupials until a video of two 1.4m tall male kangaroos in a ' boxing fight ' in one of their streets went viral this week			1
and now that images of mr @entity35 's neighbourhood have gone around the world , the 54 - year - old sheet metal worker is becoming a media personality			1
mr @entity35 , who a week ago did n't really know what @entity57 was , is being interviewed by foreign tv crews fascinated with the footage of the two buck roos slugging it out in a classic mating season joust for domination right outside his front door			1
the international media attention has astonished mr @entity35 , who with his wife , @entity36 , a trainee psychiatric nurse , moved to the street just over ten years ago to provide a better life for themselves and their children , aged 10 to 28 years old			2
the father - of - five filmed the viral footage of two kangaroos fighting in the street outside his house ( above ) on @entity82 at @entity17 he said the fight was between an alpha male who lives with his family on the street and a ' rogue male ' who challenged the buck in a 20 minute stoush residents say they ofetn see groups of roos in the street - and are forced to drive around them in that time they have seen @entity17 - an old 19th century sawmill settlement which lies on picturesque @entity18 , on the @entity19 @entity94 - experience a boom in its kangaroo population			1
' there 's a mob each with an alpha male for every street , ' mr @entity35 told @entity101 , ' and there 's three in the making at any one time , one joey in the pouch and two others			1
' they put the housing estate in here 15 years ago between @entity109 and @entity17 , where there was a lot of bushland			2
booming population : @entity114 , also known as boomers , have been growing in unprecedented numbers in the township of @entity17 , on the @entity19 @entity94 , where @entity53 resident and father of five @entity35 filmed the @entity57 viral media hit video of two boxing male roos kung fu : during the fight , the two bucks can be seen pawing at each other 's head , shoulders and chests , just like boxers during a 20 minute encounter which metal worker @entity35 said he could n't capture all of on his phone because it ran out of memory @entity114 , also known as macropods , which mean large foot , are @entity137 marsupials which grow to a height of 1.5m in the male of the species			1
they move by hopping at a speed of up to 40kph , using their powerful tail and hind legs to propel themselves			0
male kangaroos are called bucks , boomers or jacks and the females are does , or jills , and the young are called joeys			2
a group is a mob , troop or court			0
kangaroos are herbivores and usually docile towards humans , but fighting is common among males , particularly during @entity162 when the females are in season			2
during a fight , kangaroos adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other â€™s head , shoulders , and chests , just like boxers			2
they will also lock forearms , wrestle and kick and push each other			0
' it 's only a matter of time that their population will overtake the likes of us , but you have to show them respect			0
they were here long before we were			0
' mr @entity35 was at home in his garage on monday , september 29 when just after 4pm his 23 - year - old daughter , @entity41 , alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street			1
' she came in and said , " @entity192 , look at this " and i came outside to see these two males having a go at each other			0
' we 're so used to kangaroos around in the streets , but the fighting only happens once a year , in @entity162 , so i thought i 'm going to get a video of this			1
' mr @entity35 filmed the kangaroos sparring with each other for five minutes and 19 seconds until his phone ran out of memory			1
then the punching and kickboxing continue for another fifteen minutes until the two kangaroos broke and the rogue male hopped away			2
' i do n't think they really meant to hurt each other because there was no rips into their tummy with their claws , ' mr @entity35 said , ' i think it was just a show for the girls - there were female kangaroos watching it			1
tail action : the roos are seen to balance on their powerful tails and raise their legs to kick at one another , but @entity35 believes the joust was a ' show for the ladies ' as they did n't rip each other 's bellies with their claws and a group of female kangaroos was watching the entire incident outnumbered : @entity35 says since he and his wife @entity36 moved their family into @entity53 , @entity17 ten years ago the kangaroo population has burgeoned and will eventually outnumber them , but he respects the roos and is careful to give them right of way each evening on the roads ' we 're used to kangaroos coming in each morning and evening to graze on our manicured lawns			1
' when you see a mob on the road and you are driving , you give way or drive around them			0
' but you do n't usually see them fighting			0
that usually happens in the bush , so this was something different			0
' face off : typically of male kangaroos during @entity162 when the females are in season , the two adult males fight over access to females or the ascendant position near a water source , but @entity35 said the confrontation usually happens in the bush rather than on a suburban street at it again : just after 4pm on monday , september 29 just after @entity35 's 23 - year - old daughter , @entity41 , alerted him to the sounds of punching and thumping coming from the street			1
he walked out of his garage to find the two male buck kangaroos ( above ) fighting and filmed them on his phone mr @entity35 showed his wife and their other children , @entity39 , 28 , @entity40 , 25 , and @entity42 , 12 , and ten - year - old @entity43 the footage , but it was only when he went to work and showed it to his colleagues that someone recommended he upload it to @entity57			1
with his children 's help , he uploaded it on october 2			0
' it did n't really start taking off until sunday			0
it had a couple of hundred hits and then suddenly it was 30,000 and then it just took off			0
' i 've done interviews and i keep on getting phone calls			0
now there 's a crew from @entity295 who are interviewing me via @entity296			0

the boxing kangaroo video that went viral this week was shot in @entity17 , @entity19
kangaroos roam the quiet suburb whose streets each have an @entity6 roo and its family
father of five @entity35 filmed the sparring male roos outside his house
20 minute fight was a ' show for the ladies ' - female roos watching on
@entity35 did n't know what @entity57 was but his video of the boxing roos shot on his phone has had 1.5m hits
the 54 - year - old sheet metal worker says he respects the kangaroos which ' were here long before us '
