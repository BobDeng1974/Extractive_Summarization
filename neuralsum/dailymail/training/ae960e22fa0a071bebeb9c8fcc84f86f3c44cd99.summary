the world 's most expensive home is lying unused and abandoned because its billionaire owners believe moving in will bring them bad luck			0
the 27 - storey , billion - dollar tower in @entity6 , called @entity7 , is said to have fallen foul of vastu shastra - an obscure @entity11 version of feng shui			1
built for @entity14 's richest man , @entity13 - ranked by @entity15 as the ninth wealthiest person in the world with a fortune of $ 27billion - @entity13 has dominated the @entity6 skyline since being completed last year			1
abandoned : the 27 - @entity20 , built by @entity13 in @entity6 , @entity14 , is still uninhabitated reportedly because it its billionaire owner believes it would be bad luck if he moved in but speculation has grown as to why mr @entity13 , his wife @entity26 and their two children have not moved into their extravagant new home			1
certainly the property - which has three helipads , six floors of parking and a series of floating gardens - is comfortable enough			1
according to reports , the @entity13 family is concerned the building fails to conform with the ancient @entity14 architectural principles of vastu shastra , and has refused to move in for fear the home will curse them with bad luck			0
expensive : the ancient @entity11 tradition of vastu shastra emphasises the importance of facing the rising sun , but @entity20 is said to not have enough windows on its eastern side opulent : @entity7 cost $ 1billion to build and features three helipads , six floors of car parking and rising gardens , as well as a theatre and ballroom rival : construction work at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity6			1
the skyscraper is being built by the @entity65 family , and is strikingly similar to @entity7 bad luck ? @entity13 , chairman of @entity67 , has a fortune of $ 27billion , but has not moved into his dream house a year after it was finished film screenings have been staged in its state - of - the - art theatre and dinners held in its grand ballroom , served by staff trained by the luxury @entity77 hotel chain			2
but its owners return at the end of each party to their former ancestral home , never staying the night			0
@entity84 , a philosophy that guides @entity86 , emphasises the importance of facing the rising sun - and despite the staggering sum spent on @entity7 the building 's eastern side does not have enough windows or other openings to let residents receive sufficient morning light			2
instead of moving into their dream home , the @entity96 continue to stay in the more modest , 14 - storey apartment tower at the south end of the city that they share , on different floors , with the rest of their extended family			1
@entity106 , a spokesman for mr @entity13 's company @entity67 , dismissed questions about whether the family was reluctant to live at @entity7 as idle gossip			0
last year , as it was nearing completion , many @entity6 residents criticised the building as an ostentatious display of wealth in a country where most people live on less than $ 2 a day			2
half a mile from mr @entity13 's 27 - storey tower , a competing skyscraper is making its way into @entity6 's skyline			1
the building is being constructed by the @entity65 family , which controls @entity14 suit maker the @entity126			0
seen at a distance , the two buildings are strikingly similar , with soaring columns , large sea - facing windows and a nearly identical jigsaw puzzle facade			2
each floor of the tower is made from different materials to give an individual look			0
numerous powder rooms and reception areas lead off the lobby which has nine elevators glitz and glamour : @entity143 chandeliers take up most of the ceiling in the ballroom			0
there is also a stage for entertainers and a kitchen which can serve hundreds of guests fine rugs , chandeliers and mirrors feature heavily in the numerous sitting areas lthroughout the building			0

27 - storey block dominates @entity6 skyline
property boasts three helipads , six car parks and floating gardens
but family wo *n't* stay *overnight* because of lack of windows facing east
