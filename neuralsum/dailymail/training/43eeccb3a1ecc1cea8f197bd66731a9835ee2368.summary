by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 14 september 2013 family doctors are unhappy about their pay despite seeing fewer patients at evenings and weekends , according to a major report			1
the proportion of surgeries which open on @entity7 has fallen by a third in two years , while there has been a seven per cent drop in those offering evening appointments			1
yet @entity11 are unhappier with their jobs than ever before – and particularly with their pay			2
unhappy : one in five gps want more money and one in ten are thinking of quitting medicine altogether more than one in five , or 22.5 per cent , are ‘ dissatisfied ’ with salaries , and one in ten are so unhappy with their careers overall that they are considering quitting			1
family doctors earn £ 104,000 a year on average and their pay has increased by 50 per cent from a decade ago thanks to a lucrative deal agreed by @entity25 that allowed them to opt out of out - of - hours work			1
the contract , introduced in 2004 , also lets them earn bonuses by monitoring patients with certain long - term conditions			0
as a result of the agreement , most surgeries now subcontract out - of - hours work to private firms , which critics fear are more concerned with profits than patient care			1
health secretary @entity39 is in the process of negotiating a new contract with @entity11 , which could see a return to routine out - of - hours work			1
the study by the @entity45 , commissioned by the @entity46 , found just 22.5 per cent of gps do any out - of - hours shifts			1
those who do take on only four hours a week on average			2
the survey of 1,189 @entity11 found 10 per cent work at weekends , down from 15 per cent two years ago			1
ten years ago , before the @entity25 contract , nearly all @entity11 worked out of hours , with those at smaller practices on call several nights a week			1
@entity58 of campaign group @entity59 said : ‘ it ’s ludicrous , our gps are amongst the best - paid in the world			2
' gp services and the @entity64 are meant to be all about continuity of care , yet this has been destroyed by family doctors being able to opt out of working out of hours			1
‘ most patients – especially the elderly – want to see the same doctor but the present situation means they have to explain their problems to an unfamiliar face every single time			0
‘ in many areas the gp services are appalling			2
’ renegotiation : health secretary @entity39 is drawing up new contracts with @entity11 only a third of @entity11 ( 32 per cent ) said their surgery opened on saturdays and sundays , compared to 39 per cent two years earlier			1
and 76 per cent offered evening appointments , down from 81 per cent two years ago			2
the lack of availability of @entity11 has been partly blamed for the crisis in @entity85 departments , with soaring numbers of patients turning up as they do n’t know where else to go			0
this week the health secretary told @entity11 to provide better care for elderly and vulnerable patients to keep them out of casualty			1
@entity94 , of the @entity95 ’ @entity93 , said : ‘ there is no doubt patients are finding it extremely hard to get an appointment			0
' people also tell us that their once - friendly gp now has little time for conversation			2
‘ it seems as if gps are at a very low ebb and they are being expected to provide more care for vulnerable patients outside of hospital without being given the necessary resources			2
’ the research , which was carried out through questionnaires , found 8.9 per cent of gps are considering quitting or moving to a managerial role			1
gps ’ stress levels , measured on a scale of one to seven , are the highest since the survey began in 2000 , having steadily increased across 15 categories including workload , dealing with complaints and long hours			1
meanwhile 22.5 per cent of @entity11 said they were unhappy with their pay and 36.7 per cent with their hours of work			1
family doctors say that although they do not have to work out - of - hours , their job is becoming harder because patients are older , frailer and often have a number of serious illnesses that need monitoring			1
in addition , they warn increases in paperwork and targets leave them less time to see patients			0
dr @entity137 , the @entity138 chairman at doctors ’ union the @entity93 , said : ‘ general practice is under real pressure from spiralling patient demand , especially from an ageing population , and falling resources			0
‘ recent increases in targets and pointless box ticking have added another damaging level of bureaucracy that is diverting valuable time away from treating patients			0
@entity11 want to work with the government to improve patient care and to be freed from the administrative nightmare that is adding unnecessary workload to an already overstretched service			2
’ conservative mp @entity158 , who sits on the @entity159 , said : ‘ gps are under incredible stress and there is a flood of new demand			0
‘ this is partly due to the aging population but also younger patients are more aware of their rights and are more inclined to argue back			0
’ mr @entity39 is currently negotiating a new @entity11 ’ contract with doctors ’ organisations including the @entity93			2
the details will be announced later this year			0
stunning : dr @entity173 , pictured here as master of a @entity176 livery company , helped negotiate the deal he has a £ 1.6million apartment overlooking the @entity179 and a handsome income from his private healthcare firm			0
in 2004 , dr @entity173 and his @entity93 colleagues helped forge the deal securing their members a 50 per cent pay rise			0
the deal also allowed @entity11 to give up out - of - hours work			1
for more than half a century that responsibility was at the heart of @entity11 ’ contract of care			0
but the @entity25 government let them opt out , docking them just £ 6,000 each			0
‘ it was just stunning really , ’ dr @entity173 , 63 , said in 2007			0
‘ stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off			0
’ he had at first thought @entity11 ’ pay would be docked up to £ 50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out - of - hours			0
dr @entity173 then set up @entity199 to offer those very same services , only now at a profit to himself .			0

one in ten considering quitting they are so unhappy with their jobs
