more than 100,000 people on the coast of the @entity2 are in the path of a potentially deadly tsunami that could be similar to the one in 2011 that ravaged parts of @entity7			0
the new study highlights the areas in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 that would require more time to successfully evacuate for higher ground in the case of the next natural disaster			1
it calculated that 94,872 residents and 42,424 employees live within the tsunami hazard zones of the three states			0
also in danger are 486 public venues , 440 dependent care facilities and 2,314 businesses with a ' significant customer presence '			1
and some communities can increase their chance of survival simply by walking faster			1
according to the analysis , 21,562 residents , more than 50 percent of which live in @entity10 , would not have time to evade the tsunami 's waves if they were walking on foot at 2.2 mph			1
but if they adjusted their pace to 3.5 mph , the number of people at risk drops below 16,000			0
and 90 per cent of the 20,000 people who live in the two communities most at - risk , @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity10 , could reach safety by just walking at a normal pace			1
' just by getting people to move faster , you can save thousands of lives , ' @entity62 , @entity63 geographer and lead author of the study , told the @entity69			0
@entity70 said these communities would most benefit by making sure residents have studied the best tsunami evacuation routes			0
but there are the coastal towns who would n't have the time to evacuate on foot , no matter how fast they walk or run , according to the analysis , conducted by the @entity63 , the @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity83			1
this graph ranks the chances of the 73 communities considered to be in the tsunami danger zone for a successful evacuation			2
the third class is considered ' unlikely to have successful evacuations ' @entity10 communities @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , as well as @entity11 town @entity96 , are listed as ' unlikely to have successful evacuations '			2
according to @entity70 , these specific communities need to instead work toward designing and constructing tsunami evacuation structures so that reaching higher ground is n't necessary			1
but the study , published in the @entity101 , warns that successful evacuations are not guaranteed for any community - no matter where its located			2
' individuals still need to understand the threat , recognize signs of imminent waves and take self - protective action , ' it concludes			0
@entity70 told @entity110 that any community on the coast of the @entity2 was ' vulnerable to varying degrees ' to a tsunami			0
' having a better sense of how a community is specifically vulnerable provides officials with the ability to develop outreach , preparedness , and evacuation plans that are tailored to local conditions and needs			0

also in danger are over *400* public venues and dependent care facilities
study estimates *77* *%* of communities have the 15 - 25 minutes required to evacuate safely after an earthquake hits
some communities in @entity10 , the most at - risk state , could increase chance of survival simply by walking faster
but certain communities along the coast are too far from high ground for a safe evacuation - no matter how fast they walk
they will need to build special evacuation structures instead
