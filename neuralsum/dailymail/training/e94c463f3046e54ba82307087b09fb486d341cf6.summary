by @entity0 it 's on the brink of extinction throughout @entity4 and while most people will never get the chance to see a tiger quoll in the wild , the rare animal has been captured on camera in bush in the @entity12 in @entity13			1
as part of the @entity18 survey , @entity15 researchers set up 90 sites with motion - activated cameras in isolated and urban areas in the @entity23 area in the hope of getting a glimpse of @entity4 's biggest marsupial carnivore			1
research team member @entity27 told @entity28 as the anaimals are listed as endangered , there is a possibility the tiger quoll could become extinct within a decade			1
nine endangered tiger quolls , including the one pictured , were captured by motion - activated cameras in @entity37 bushland over the summer months , lured by the smell of chicken wings using chicken wings as bait , nine tiger quolls were lured towards the cameras and captured in @entity37 bush , south west of @entity45			1
' the wings were n't accessible - the quolls pretty much come and smell the bait and have a look around and then leave , ' ms @entity27 said			2
the cameras used by the researchers were similar to those use by police in the hunt for @entity4 's previously most wanted fugitive @entity56 , while he was hiding in @entity58 bushland in 2012			1
in one of the images , a tiger quoll can be seen wandering the bush floor , with a native lyrebird in the background , while another climbs a stump			2
while the research has been hailed a success , tiger quolls are endangered and could become extinct with a decade			1
pictured is a second tiger quoll captured by the cameras during the survey the survey was conducted over the summer with an aim of establishing if and where quolls live in the @entity23 area			1
' we do n't know much about the habitat and area so we 're just doing a blanket survey at the moment , ' ms @entity27 said			2
' historical records occur all up and down the eastern seaboard but some sightings are quite old			0
since @entity92 settlement , their numbers have declined - we know roughly where they are , it 's just a matter of updating sightings			2
' as the team was looking for an endangered species , ms @entity27 said she did not expect to see too many of the animals but that nine was a strong number			2
' it was certainly a good sign of population , ' she said			0
' i would say the study is a success , i have colleagues working with endangered species who can go four years without seeing an animal			2
' since @entity92 settlement , tiger quolls numbers have declined , but the animals can still be found primarily in @entity13 and stretching to @entity112 and @entity113 ms @entity27 said she was confident the quolls captured by the cameras were all different and that the research method was appropriate for a first attempt			1
' we set the traps quite a distance away from each other - about half a kilometre apart , ' she said			0
all nine sightings occured in the bush areas , but the researcher said despite not seeing any in urban areas , the area of bush was popular with campers , bush walkers and dirt bike riders			0
the sightings will allow the researchers to monitor the numbers to better manage the populations			0
' now that we 've do n't this , we can do a much more targeted survey and research of the species in general , ' she said			0
however , ms @entity27 said she could not make a conclusion at this stage on tiger quoll numbers or habitat preference in @entity13			1
the @entity145 , pictured , is surrounded by bush and national park land and is popular with campers and bush walkers she said an unrelated nine - year survey from the @entity151 to the @entity112 boarder only found 19 of the animals , but added there could be many variables contributing to this number			2
with the @entity159 research finished , the team is now shifting their next research area to the @entity162 area south of @entity163			1
she said there had been reported sightings in this area in recent years			2
@entity170 ( @entity169 ) spokesperson @entity168 said in the past year , two tiger quolls had come into the organisation 's care			1
' one in @entity173 and one in the @entity175 , ' he said			0
' it 's an uncommon species to come into care			0
two in a year is pretty normal - it 's about as infrequent as we get them			0
to spot them is very rare			0
' they have very large territories			0
they live in isolation and live solitary lives			0
their existence in @entity163 would be quite low			2
' @entity190 quolls can also be found in @entity112 and @entity113			1
in february a tiger quoll was filmed in the @entity192 in @entity112 shortly after bushfires raged through a third of the park			0
the animals were thought to have been locally extinct as the species had not been seen in the @entity192 area in more than 140 years , reported the @entity199			1
the @entity145 , where the tiger quolls were spotted , is south west of @entity45 @entity202 senior catcher @entity201 said the @entity203 estimates there are about 20,000 tiger quolls left			1
but ms @entity201 said what the population numbers were doing was more important than the actual amount , and in the case of the tiger quoll , numbers were decreasing			0
she said the zoo has a pair of female tiger quolls and its focus is on education			1
' we try and inspire people to take action , ' she said			0
ms @entity201 said the people who live in areas where there are tiger quolls can help by connecting fragments of bush important to the animals ' survival			1
' planting locally native plant species or joining bush regeneration groups , ' she said and added this was particularly important because of the animals ' massive home ranges of up to 500 hectares			0
on the back of the tiger quoll sightings , she said it was ' fantastic ' that the animals were living relatively close to @entity163 and that land owners in the @entity23 area had a unique opportunity to help the animals			1
' with land clearing for hobby farms and properties , there 's scope for land owners to have an impact by retaining natural vegetation , ' she said			0
despite quolls sometimes getting into chicken coops , she added that people needed to remember the animals were a highly threatened species .			0

rare tiger quolls spotted in @entity37 in @entity12
nine of the quolls were captured on stop - motion cameras in bushland
researchers will now complete a survey of @entity162 area south of @entity163
@entity190 quolls are endangered in @entity13 and could become extinct with 10 years
