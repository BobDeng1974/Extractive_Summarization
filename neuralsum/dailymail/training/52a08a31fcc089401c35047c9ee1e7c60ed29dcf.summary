a ' @entity0 ' in @entity1 was once home to dinosaurs that lived among early mammals , amphibians and other strange creatures 160 million years ago			1
the extraordinary fossil bed contains the bones of pterosaurs - early mammals – including the first known swimming mammal with a beaver - like tail , the earliest gliding mammal and feathered dinosaurs			1
their remarkably preserved remains were discovered in rocks beneath the @entity17 in north eastern @entity1 - a famous collection of 130 million - year - old fossils from the @entity20			1

this is a reconstruction of the @entity30 site 's fauna the @entity30 is the name for a group of 160million - year - old fossils			0
they were discovered in rocks beneath the @entity17 in north eastern @entity1 - a famous collection of 130 million - year - old fossils from the @entity20			1
the fossils shed light on life in the @entity40 30million years earlier when birds are believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs			1
fossils include complete or nearly - complete skeletons associated with preserved soft tissues such as feathers , fur , skin or even , in some of the salamanders , external gills			1
the soft tissues of feathered dinosaur @entity52 have been revealed by the use of ultraviolet light scanners			0
a fossil of a salamander @entity56 shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills			2
the latest discovery sheds light on life in the @entity40 30million years earlier when birds are believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs			1
the newly discovered @entity66 fossils have been named the @entity30 fossils or @entity30 after a village near one of the six sites dug up and have been catalogued and described in detail			0
a new study has classified these fossils as belonging to a distinct ecological group , or biota from the famous 130 - million - year - old specimens , which include the world 's most exquisitely preserved feathered dinosaurs			1
the @entity66 fossils date from a time when many important vertebrates including mammals were undergoing evolutionary diversification			0
dr @entity84 , of the @entity85 and @entity86 in @entity87 , said : ‘ the @entity30 gives us a look at a rarely glimpsed side of the @entity40 to @entity91			0
‘ this is not a parade of galumphing giants but an assemblage of quirky little creatures like feathered dinosaurs , pterosaurs with “ advanced ” heads on “ primitive ” bodies and the @entity102 equivalent of a flying squirrel			2
’ a feathered dinosaur , @entity52 , was found at the site			0
the inset shows feathers and soft tissues revealed by the use of ultraviolet light almost more impressive than the diversity of the biota is the preservation of many of the vertebrate specimens , according to the study published in the @entity117			0
fossils include complete or nearly - complete skeletons associated with preserved soft tissues such as feathers , fur , skin or even , in some of the salamanders , external gills			2
one is the feathered dinosaur @entity52 whose soft tissues have been revealed by the use of ultraviolet light scanners			0
a fossil of the @entity56 shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills			2
dr @entity134 , co-author of the study , said : ‘ the @entity30 amphibians are crucially important in the study of the phylogeny and early radiation of modern amphibian groups			0
’ a fossil of the salamander @entity143 shows not only the preserved skeleton but also its skin and external gills ( pictured ) the site in @entity1 sheds new light on the array of fauna living 160million years ago dr @entity149 , dinosaur researcher at the @entity150 in @entity151 who reviewed the study for the journal , said : ‘ @entity30 is proving to be one of the key sites for understanding the evolution of feathered dinosaurs , early mammals , and flying reptiles due largely to the fantastic levels of preservation			1
‘ many of the fossils are stunning and offer vast amounts of information			0
there are only a handful of similar sites elsewhere in the world			0
‘ because the @entity30 and the much better studied @entity17 are similar in preservational mode and geographic location - but separated by tens of millions of years - they give palaeontologists an outstanding , even unique , opportunity to study changes in the fauna of this region over a significant span of geological time and an important period in vertebrate evolution			2
’ dr @entity84 said : ‘ the @entity20 feathered dinosaurs of north eastern @entity1 have been astonishing palaeontologists and the public for almost two decades now and the @entity30 preserves their @entity40 counterparts in the same region			1
as prequels go it 's pretty exciting			0

fossils of *curious* creatures living 160million years ago were discovered in rocks beneath the famous @entity17 in north eastern @entity1
they shed light on life in the @entity40 when birds are believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs
fossils of a salamander with external gills , the first swimming mammal with a beaver - like tail and early feathered dinosaurs were uncovered
