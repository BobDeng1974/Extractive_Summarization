miscarriage of justice ? a @entity3 lawyer has petitioned the @entity4 to have @entity6 ' conviction and death sentence quashed a @entity3 lawyer has petitioned the @entity9 to overturn the trial and conviction of @entity6 and his subsequent death sentence			1
@entity13 , a former spokesman of the @entity15 , is attempting to sue , among others , the @entity17 and the @entity18 over the execution of the @entity20			2
he has turned to the @entity22 - based court , which usually hears matters of international law , after an attempt to file the suit at the @entity27 of @entity28 was thrown out in 2007			0
mr @entity29 hopes to have @entity6 ' conviction quashed			1
' his selective and malicious prosecution violated his human rights through judicial misconduct , abuse of office bias and prejudice , ' the lawyer told @entity3 paper @entity38			1
few apparent miscarriages of justice have reverberated as far and as long as the conviction and crucifiction of @entity6 more than 2,000 years ago			1
according to the @entity44 , the @entity43 ran into trouble after performing miracles and claiming he was the son of @entity48 , prompting @entity50 authorities to arrest him on charges of blasphemy			0
they brought him to @entity55 , then the @entity56 of @entity57 , who told them he did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and sent him to @entity62 , who sent him back to @entity55			0
@entity55 found @entity6 not guilty of any charges but , after crowds of angry @entity50 called for him to be executed , the governor gave in and had him crucified alongside two criminals			1
mr @entity29 's case challenges the mode of questioning used during @entity6 ' trial ; the punishments meted out to him while proceedings were still underway ; and the substance of the information used to convict him			1
he hopes to establish what crime @entity6 was charged with and hopes the court declares that ' the proceedings before the @entity79 courts were a nullity in law for they did not conform to the rule of law at the material time and any time thereafter			1
' ' some of those present spat in his face , struck him with their fists , slapped him , taunted him , and pronounced him worthy of death , ' he added			0
see you in court : @entity13 , a former spokesman of the @entity15 , is attempting to sue , among others , the @entity17 and the state of @entity18 over the execution of the @entity20 mr @entity29 hopes to rely on the precedent set in the case of @entity97 , the peasant girl who proclaimed herself a warrior sent by @entity48 to deliver @entity99 from the @entity100 , whose trial and conviction was later found unsound			2
' this is the same case with @entity6			2
the judge who sentenced him said that he had no jurisdiction to attend to the matter but he went ahead to convict and pass a capital sentence under duress , ' he said			0
legal experts do not expect mr @entity29 's efforts to be a success , ironically because the @entity9 does not have legal jurisdiction			0
@entity113 , professor of law at @entity114 , told @entity117 's @entity116 political blog : ' the @entity9 only has jurisdiction to hear claims that are brought by one state against another state			0
' as this claim is not brought by a state , the @entity9 would lack jurisdiction over it			0

@entity127 *believes* trial and execution violated @entity6 ' human rights
