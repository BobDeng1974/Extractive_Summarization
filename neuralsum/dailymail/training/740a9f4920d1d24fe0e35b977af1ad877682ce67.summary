by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:33 est , 9 december 2013 the @entity3 has for the first time released an interactive map that shows all serious crimes committed in the city - confirming the increased danger of living in a poor neighborhood			1
enabling @entity11 to finally see how their street matches up against other boroughs , the map reveals that incidences of the seven major felony crimes - including murder , rape and robbery - are more common in neighborhoods where the average income is lower			1
@entity3 and the city 's @entity21 and @entity23 unveiled the new map on sunday despite the force 's insistence that the statistics have been available on their website since 2003			0
color coded : the darker the neighborhood precinct the more crime per thousand people is committed			0
from this map areas of @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 have experienced most violent crime since january a comparison of this map based on @entity42 and the newly released interactive crime map from the @entity3 shows that shootings and murders are more prevalent in poorer neighborhoods of @entity11 however , despite the notable exception of @entity37 , where the majority of crimes are petty robberies , most seriously violent crime occurs in @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity36			1
indeed , last month @entity3 police commissioner @entity53 told the @entity54 , ' last year , 97 percent of all shooting victims were black or @entity56 and reside in low - income neighborhoods			0
' however , some lower income neighborhoods in @entity11 do not conform so readily			0
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 in @entity62 are relatively safe despite their average lower incomes			0
@entity37 : as expected @entity68 is the crime hotspot of @entity11 - but suffers relatively little violent crime - with the majority of the almost 2,000 crimes reported since january 2013 being robberies details : the map can be enlarged to show as near to possible where each crime was reported			1
larger circles mean multiple crimes were reported in the vicinity and despite their reputations , @entity78 and @entity79 in upper @entity37 do appear to be safer than the public would give them credit for			2
the launch of the map provides felony crime information for this past year , the current year and by next month within the current year			0
@entity3 commissioner @entity53 said : ' with unprecedented population levels , @entity11 is safer than ever , with homicides on pace this year to fall below recent historic lows			0
' this administration has relied on data to drive its crime fighting , and this map helps enhance @entity11 ' and researchers ' understanding of where felony and violent crime persists			1
' the public can search basic data on felony crime occurrence by address , @entity104 , or police precinct and displays all recorded crimes at the nearest street or intersection to the reported location			2
this map shows that large swaths of @entity62 and all of @entity112 to be areas relatively free from serious crimes one of the worst neighborhoods for crime in @entity11 is @entity52 and this map shows the number of robberies between 1st @entity120 and oct 31st this year number 1 : @entity37 as a whole suffers greater crime than some parts of the other four boroughs @entity11 , @entity125 , @entity126 --- police officers stand behind police tape on the scene where a @entity11 traffic police officer was hit and killed by a vehicle in @entity132 , @entity11 filters can be applied to the map which shows crimes per 1000 residents as a shaded map which is graduated in color to dark where incidences are highest			1
commissioner @entity53 said the city is safer than ever , but the map helps @entity11 and researchers understand where major crimes persist			2
previously , the only crime data posted online were weekly reports broken down by precinct , but they were n't posted in the form of an interactive map			1
before his mayoral election victory , @entity151 had criticized the @entity3 for its failure to respond to one - third of freedom of information requests			0
the map is part of a new city - wide law requiring all government data to be made available online			1
precinct 41 in @entity36 has proved to be one of the worst spots for crimes this year with an average of almost 26 crimes per 1,000 residents			2

interactive map shows all serious crimes committed within @entity11 for the first time
worst crime spot is @entity37 , but majority of offenses are petty robberies
most seriously violent crime occurs in @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity36
@entity179 is part of a new city - wide law requiring all government data to be made available online
