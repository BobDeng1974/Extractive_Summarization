a grieving widow said she was frightened for the lives of herself and her family thanks to a ' nasty ' neighbour who terrorised them for seven years			1
during the course of her harassment , @entity6 's neighbour @entity5 plagued her with silent calls , taunted her dying husband and attacked her son with secateurs			1
it 's not the quiet and peaceful life pensioners @entity6 and her late husband @entity15 expected when they moved to a static home on a community park for over- 50s in @entity19 , @entity20 , following @entity15 's retirement in 2002			1
she did n't even show any compassion when @entity15 was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011 and continued to torment @entity6 and her son from a previous marriage , @entity23 , when they were grieving his death a year later			1
@entity6 reveals on @entity38 's @entity37 how @entity5 turned on her after finding out she had struck up a friendship with another woman on the community park			1
@entity6 explains : ' our relationship started off very well , she was a very nice person , if she could help you in any way she would			2
she used to come in and have a cup of tea , we became friends			0
' but it all changed when @entity6 started spending more time with another neighbour as they were working on a gardening project together			2
@entity5 started ignoring her and when @entity6 asked why , she was told : ' because i had a new best friend , she did n't want to know us any more			1
' @entity23 holds up some secateurs like the one @entity58 had her her hand when she attacked him @entity6 admits : ' i thought that was a bit petty , i did n't know you were restricted to one friend in life			0
' but then @entity5 's behaviour took a more sinister turn			2
she began making silent phone calls to the couple day and night			1
@entity6 said : ' it unnerved us very much , you do n't know why people are making silent calls or who they are			1
' they discovered @entity5 was the culprit after the police traced the calls			2
she was given a fixed penalty notice and fine			0
but @entity6 said it only led to her harassment becoming worse			0
' she 'd walk past the house and stick her fingers up at us			0
she started shouting abuse through the windows calling us peeping @entity88 and perverts - it went on like this for four years , ' @entity6 recalled			1
' it got to the stage where i 'd wake up and think " i hope nothing happens today " , i 'd always have a sick feeling in my stomach			0
' then in march 2011 @entity15 was diagnosed with terminal cancer and told he did n't have long to live			1
when @entity5 heard the news , instead of expressing sympathy , she mocked @entity15 telling him : ' you 've got cancer , you are going to die			1
' she also started making her crank phone calls again			1
@entity6 said : ' @entity15 was terminally ill so we had precious time left and to have that spoiled by someone making unnecessary phone calls made things worse			1
why do it when you know he 's dying ? why cause us this much hassle ? ' the couple again got the police involved and @entity5 pleaded guilty to harassment in court and was fined Â£ 100			2
she signed a community resolution saying she would stay away from the family but she did n't stick to it			0
@entity5 , pictured in footage taken by @entity23 , would taunt the family about @entity15 's cancer when @entity23 was visiting one day , he said she threatened him with a four - foot long branch			1
@entity23 said : ' i was pottering around in the garden and she was on the other side of the fence			0
she started spurting her mouth off about @entity15 having cancer saying " oh dear , guess who 's got cancer , and guess who 's got terminal cancer "			1
' i stepped closer and saw she had a weapon - a branch in her hand			0
' @entity23 then filmed @entity5 with his mobile phone appearing to hit him with the branch over the fence			2
following @entity15 's death , @entity23 moved in with his mother to support her and he continued to be abused by @entity5			1
' as soon as i walked in the back gate she would be waiting for me , ' he said			0
@entity15 died in 2012 with no sympathy from @entity5 who instead harassed the family with crank calls despite being heterosexual , @entity23 said @entity5 would make homophobic jibes towards him as well as calling him a ' w * * * * * ' and a ' mummy 's boy '			1
then one day the abuse became physical after @entity5 's dog attacked @entity23 's , @entity152 , after leaping into their garden			1
@entity23 said : ' i heard a crash bang from the garden and @entity152 was in the jaws of a pretty big dog			0
' @entity23 rescued @entity152 and kept @entity5 's dog in the house , causing @entity5 to then climb over the fence , holding secateurs , demanding her pet back			2
' she started hitting me screaming " give me my dog back " , ' @entity23 said			0
' the secateurs missed my throat by an inch			0
' @entity6 witnessed the encounter and tried to intervene to stop @entity5 attacking her son			1
' i was frightened for our lives			0
we told her to get back into her own garden and then we 'd give her her dog , ' she said			0
' we called the police , i dread to think what she could have done			0
' @entity5 told the police she had been acting in self defence so @entity6 and @entity23 decided not to press charges			2
instead , they collected all the evidence they had of @entity5 's abusive behaviour and submitted it to the owner of the community park			2
this led to @entity5 being served an eviction notice and she was told to leave within eight weeks			0
@entity6 said @entity5 continued to be ' nasty ' in this time and once again @entity23 said she hit him when he caught her prowling around his mother 's house at night			1
the mother and son were delighted and relieved when @entity5 was finally evicted			0
' i 'm not sorry she 's gone i have a much more peaceful life now and can grieve for @entity194 , ' @entity6 said			2
' i 'm so sorry he was n't here to see the day she went			0
' soon i will get some new neighbours and i pray to @entity198 they will be nice and not neighbours from hell			0
' the @entity37 is on @entity38 wednesdays at 8pm			0
