plastic banknotes which can survive a hot 90 - degree washing machine cycle could arrive in @entity3 within three years , the @entity0 said yesterday			1
in a break with tradition , the @entity0 is considering ditching the current £ 5 and £ 10 notes – which are made from cotton paper – and replacing them with ones made from polymer			1
the new notes last for more than twice as long , stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear			2
the @entity0 could introduce polymer £ 5 and £ 10 notes ( pictured ) within three years that can survive a spin in a washing machine the move will save the bank more than £ 100million over a ten - year period because of the new banknote ’s improved durability			1
a typical £ 5 note currently lasts for two years			2
the new ones would last for just under six years , it was announced yesterday			0
plastic notes were introduced in @entity26 in 1988 to try and stop counterfeiting			2
they are due to be issued in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 and current governor of the @entity0 introduced them in his native @entity35			1
a special one - off plastic £ 5 was previously issued in @entity38 to commemorate the @entity39			0
the bank says the introduction of plastic notes will save about £ 10million a year as they will not have to be replaced so often			1
polymer £ 5 notes will measure 125mm by 65mm , smaller than the current note			2
supporters of polymer notes say they are more hygienic , harder to tear and more difficult to counterfeit			1
but critics say they stick together and are slippery			0
and they can also be recycled to create items including plant pots and garden furniture – a move which is likely to please @entity54 , the wife of the new bank governor and a committed environmentalist			0
her husband @entity57 was at the helm of the @entity60 when polymer notes were introduced in 2011 , and is importing the idea to @entity3 just 11 weeks after taking over the top job			1
the @entity0 said yesterday it will initially look only at changing £ 5 and £ 10 notes , with the new £ 5 featuring sir @entity65 becoming the first polymer note in 2016			1
but they are planning to hold focus groups and meetings in shopping centres to test public opinion about the scheme			0
and if the feedback is overwhelmingly negative the @entity0 have promised to scrap the idea altogether			2
the new notes will still feature the queen and a well - known person , but will be slightly smaller than the current note			0
the £ 5 note is now 135mm by 70mm			0
the new one will measure just 125mm by 65mm			0
but they will continue to maintain ‘ tiered - sizing ’ – meaning that the higher the denomination , the bigger the note will be			0
the @entity0 has tested the polymer notes in a 90 - degree washing cycle which seemed to have only ‘ a minimal effect ’ , unlike the current notes which can be ‘ substantially degraded ’			1
they then ‘ submerged them in liquids , including red wine , ’ and found they could be wiped clean , unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates			0
polymer notes are already used in more than 20 countries , including @entity26 , @entity29 , @entity31 , @entity96 and @entity97 as well as in @entity35			1
the @entity0 said polymer notes would save them £ 10million a year because they last longer new @entity0 governor @entity100 introduced polymer notes to @entity35 previously but the @entity60 was forced to deny that their notes were scented , after authorities were inundated with queries about why people thought that they could detect a ‘ hint of maple ’ when smelling the bills			1
questions remained last night about how cash machines or payment machines would cope with the new notes			0
but a spokesman for @entity114 , the company which is behind 66,000 of @entity3 ’s cash machines , said : ‘ the atm industry will work closely with the bank to ensure their effective introduction			2
’ the public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to finish on 15 november and a final decision will be announced in december .			0
