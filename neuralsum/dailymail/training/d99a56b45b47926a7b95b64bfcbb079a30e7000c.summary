a black market surgery victim too ashamed to date after being turned into a ' monster ' has undergone a dramatic transformation			1
@entity3 , 46 , from @entity4 , was dubbed ' cement face ' after a fake medic pumped a concrete - like filler into her cheeks , lips , breasts and buttocks			1
but , thanks to a kind - hearted doctor , her previously ' hard - as - rock ' face is much improved and she is now swamped by admirers			1
' now i 'm feeling more confident and with a good bit of makeup i can achieve somewhat of an exotic look			2
' recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon			2
i did n't know whether to slap him or kiss him			2
' @entity3 , who was born a man , is given monthly softening injections and laser therapy by dr @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity4			1
this has helped reduce the size of the nodules on her face			1
the self - confessed cougar has grown in confidence and is now a regular on the @entity4 dating scene and has been flooded with romantic requests online			1
@entity3 's face following black - market injections in @entity4 , @entity45 she said : ' a lot of the men i date are straight and so they like to do a lot of dating under the radar			1
' that can be really hard to deal with			2
but now my confidence is up i feel like i could meet a boyfriend or a husband who loves me for who i am			2
' i definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window			0
' the transgender activist has also been buoyed by the news that the fake doctor who operated on her has been jailed			1
@entity63 @entity62 , 32 , herself a transgendered woman , was jailed for 366 days in january after admitting one count of practicing healthcare without a license			0
@entity62 reportedly injected @entity68 , @entity69 and mineral oil into the buttocks of women during illegal cosmetic surgeries			0
@entity3 , who was born in @entity74 but grew up in @entity75 , was bullied at school			1
she said : ' up until i was in my mid-twenties i just thought i was a feminine gay male			0
i thought about all the things i did when i was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it i was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy			1
' when i used to fantasise about being with guys i used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina			0
i did n't realise i was doing it , it was just so natural for me			0
one day i just connected all the dots and thought ' you 're not gay , you 're transgender			0
' @entity3 , who had been too ' embarrassed and ashamed ' to go to the authorities , says she paid just £ 60 per session to @entity62 for the life - changing injections back in 2005			1
@entity3 as a boy ( left ) and before her transformation ( right ) - she previously thought she was a ' feminine man ' she said : ' the last thing i wanted was to look like a man in a dress			1
i wanted to be a beautiful woman			0
' if you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction			1
' so i made the choice to get injections done			0
in our community it is called ' pumping '			0
' she told @entity4 television station @entity116 at the time : ' it becomes so dire that you want to match your outside with your inside that you 're willing to roll the dice and take your chances			1
' as a transgender person , you 're thinking , " oh , my @entity124 , i can start to look like i want to look like and i do n't have to spend a lot of money			0
" ' @entity3 , born a man , soon realised she was a woman in a man 's body ' when it finally came to the day , i was more excited than nervous because i was finally going to be the woman i had always wanted to be			1
' there was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures			0
' it appeared to be pretty sterile			0
it was like an extra bedroom that she had turned into a clinical area and i would go in and pay the money			0
' i got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially i was fine			1
but then the nightmare started			0
' it first felt like a huge boil on the side of my face and then it kept getting bigger and bigger as the day went along			2
' it got really painful and then suddenly green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror			2
it was green and yellow and mixed with blood			0
she added : ' sometimes i wake up in bed in the middle of the night and i ask myself : ' what have you done ? ' my message to anyone that would consider doing what i did is do n't do it			0
you could die or you could end up like me : disfigured			2
' @entity3 , who spent a total of £ 1,825 ( $ 3,000 ) over 10 months on the injections , spent years in solitude suffering from post-traumatic stress , depression and agoraphobia			1
@entity3 was left with hard lumps in her face , pictured , following black - market injections @entity177 , 32 , pictured in court , accepts a sentence of 366 days in prison for illegal practice of healthcare in october but her life changed when two years later a friend referred her to dr @entity31 , who offered to help her for free			1
the operations she has had and is having with dr @entity31 are kenalog facial injections , laser surgery and ultrasound			0
these help reduce the size of the nodules in her face			2
she also had two invasive surgeries earlier in her treatment with dr @entity31			0
in the first one his scissor broke while trying to remove the filler because the lumps were ' as hard as concrete '			1
he said : ' the progress @entity3 is making is actually much better than i had ever hoped or expected			1
' we thought that the nodules would probably just soften up a little bit - but there are now some areas on her face where they actually seem to have gone away			1
' the future for @entity3 's face is much more positive but i worry about the inflammation in the rest of her body			1
' she has had a a really large volume of substance injected into both her breasts and buttocks and we 're not quite sure what it is			0
' he added : ' this sort of black - market surgery is probably the worst thing you could do			2
you 're lucky if you just develop nodules			0
other people have lost limbs or even died			0
' dr @entity31 's technician treats @entity3 at a clinic in @entity229 , @entity45 for now @entity3 says she plans to continue to enjoy her life as best she can with her tight - knit network of friends			1
and while she will always continue to suffer the effects of the injections , she is determined to enjoy life - and love - once again			2
she said : ' i feel like i have somehow managed to turn lemons into lemonade			0
i am finally starting a new chapter in my life			0
' with dr @entity31 helping me to improve my looks a great deal i 'm feeling much more confident and optimistic for the future			0
' i 've gone from being victim to victorius			2
' @entity3 , who has a new - found confidence and lots of admirers , applies make up at home @entity3 , pictured with friends on a night out , is ready for romance with the right person			1
