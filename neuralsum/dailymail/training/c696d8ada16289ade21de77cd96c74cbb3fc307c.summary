@entity0 was annoyed to see his @entity2 team - mates resort to route - one football at times in saturday 's disappointing draw at @entity5			1
@entity6 is still searching for his first win as @entity9 boss following the uninspiring goalless stalemate at @entity11			1
@entity13 , playing in a midfield three alongside @entity0 and @entity12 , produced flashes of brilliance , but @entity16 and @entity17 both had off days up front and could not convert a host of chances			1
@entity0 admits @entity2 lacked confidence in their build - up play on saturday , which led them to start pumping long balls up field			1
' maybe in the build - up [ there were confidence issues ] as we were trying to build up from the back but sometimes we did n't do it well , ' the @entity34 told @entity41			0
' we played most of the time in their half which is good but , if you do n't score from these chances , then it 's not good enough			0
' i believe , when we try to play football in the last third , we can create but we played too many long balls in the first half which is maybe why we did n't play as well			1
' stalemate : @entity2 drew 0 - 0 with newly - promoted @entity5 at @entity11 this match just how big a gap there is between @entity2 and the teams vying for the title			1
@entity57 tore @entity5 apart in a thrilling first half at @entity11 on the opening weekend of the season , but @entity2 failed to impose themselves on the game until late in the second half			1
@entity2 's faltering start has affected the team 's self - belief , according to their manager			1
' i do n't think our confidence level was very high in the first half , ' said @entity21 , who suffered an embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat to @entity71 on tuesday			1
' but i think that 's normal when a club like @entity2 loses the first match and draws the second one			2
' the pressure is higher and you have to cope with that			0
i could see in the first half that the players were very nervous to play the ball			0
' we restored that in the second half , and maybe that will raise our confidence			0
' debut : @entity87 record transfer signing @entity13 made his @entity89 debut against @entity5 the one crumb of comfort for @entity2 was the influence of @entity93 , who completed his record - breaking move to @entity2 from @entity95 on tuesday			1
the £ 59.7million man created a couple of openings with incisive passes and his running stretched the @entity5 defence in the first half when he drifted out wide			2
@entity102 thinks @entity2 have pulled off a major coup by signing the midfielder , who was one of the stars of the @entity106			2
' i think it makes a big statement to people out there , ' @entity102 said			0
' a lot of people might say we ca n't attract world - class players but we 've just done that with the signings of @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , @entity121 ( @entity120 ) , @entity122 ( @entity123 ) and now @entity13			2
' @entity13 is a fantastic signing			0
@entity95 have other top players in their team like [ @entity128 ] @entity127 and [ @entity129 ] @entity129 but he 's the one who stood out for me in that team			0
problems : @entity6 is still without a @entity89 win and is already out of the @entity134 ' when you add quality to a squad that already has quality it can only help us			2
' @entity5 manager @entity141 can only dream of being able to sign a player for almost £ 60million			0
the fact that the @entity5 have only spent £ 45million on transfers in their 132 - year history shows how impressive saturday 's draw was for the @entity89 newcomers			1
' @entity2 are in a transitional period but they are still very good , ' said @entity141 , who suffered defeats to @entity57 and @entity149 in his opening two games			0
' it 's the strongest i 've seen them since the start of the season so we are very happy			2
' it 's important we go into the international break after a really good performance and your first point on the board			0
' and when the games come around again after taking stock of the season so far , we 'll be ready to go hard again			0
