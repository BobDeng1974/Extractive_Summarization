@entity13 peer @entity2 gave his forthright opinion as mps took evidence on standards in the banking industry			1
he said : ‘ in my experience , they [ pay consultants ] are a profession which makes prostitution seem thoroughly respectable			1
’ and @entity2 , who ran @entity25 ’s finances under @entity26 , refused to back down even when a female witness giving evidence to him took exception to the characterisation			1
@entity31 , a senior pay consultant with accountancy firm @entity32 , said it was ‘ difficult ’ to accept the suggestion that her profession was worse than prostitution			1
‘ it may be difficult but it may be true , ’ retorted the famously outspoken @entity38 grandee			2
@entity2 , who as @entity2 served as chancellor under @entity26 , said pay consultants feared missing out on future advisory fees if they angered bank bosses by suggesting modest pay deals			1
‘ they know that if they recommend low pay , they wo n’t get a repeat performance ... so they pitch it as high as they can , ’ he said			1
another witness , management author @entity53 , said there was an ‘ extremely powerful nexus ’ in the business community with a ‘ vested interest in high pay ’			2
he accused bankers of profiting from a myth that very few people could do their job , despite the fact that it is ‘ extremely questionable whether they have a rare talent ’			2
and he said bosses were too scared to cut the pay of junior staff , in case their own salaries were slashed as well			2
‘ these decisions are hard - wired into the system , ’ he said			2
hearing : @entity2 , pictured with daughter @entity73 , made the comments as mps took evidence on standards in the banking industry the banking standards committee also heard from former @entity81 pay chief @entity80 , who said she had been a lone voice in calling for former boss @entity83 to be stripped of his bonus in 2011			1
mr @entity83 was awarded a £ 2.7million bonus in 2011 , the same year that the bank had to put aside £ 1billion to cover the cost of compensation for mis - selling @entity90 loan insurance			0
former @entity81 chief executive @entity83 received a £ 2.7m bonus in 2011 ms @entity80 said she had been ‘ amazed ’ when @entity81 chairman @entity92 recommended that the bonus be paid anyway			0
‘ i thought it was the wrong recommendation and ... it would have been best if his bonus for the year had been zero , ’ she said , adding that this would have set a ‘ leadership example ’			0
but she said fellow directors were worried at how mr @entity83 would react to losing the payout			0
‘ there were conversations in corridors , ’ she said			0
‘ a lot of people felt mr @entity83 needed to have his bonus and that it was important to him			0
’ she added that investment bankers had become used to an ‘ obscene level of reward ’ and indulged in a ‘ culture of entitlement ’			0
mr @entity83 later stepped down after the bank was fined £ 290million for its role in the @entity118 interest rate - rigging scandal			0
her successor sir @entity119 raised eyebrows among mps when he said that even with hindsight he would still pay mr @entity123 a bonus , because he ‘ deserved some recognition ’			1
but he insisted reports that @entity81 ’ new boss @entity127 was in line for a £ 1million bonus this year were just ‘ speculation ’			0
asked if he was aware that a payout on that scale could spark fury among the public , he said : ‘ i understand the implications of your question very well			0
