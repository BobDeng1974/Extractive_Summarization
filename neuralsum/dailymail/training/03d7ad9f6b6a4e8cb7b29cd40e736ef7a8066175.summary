@entity0 used to come to @entity1 often			1
not to fight but to play the tables in the casinos which rake in more revenue than their namesakes in @entity6			2
that was before he found politics , basketball and , most importantly , @entity11			0
’ this week the @entity0 is here to fight @entity14			1
the @entity23 matinee idol is five years younger , five inches taller , undefeated and a world light - welter champion in his own right			1
not only is @entity0 ’s world welterweight title at stake in this catch - weight contest but the hope of tempting @entity36 into a potential billion dollar fight next year			1
the 35 - year - old @entity38 revealed he felt as fit as he did in the early stages of his career so could this be a bigger gamble than any wager he laid in his partly miss - spent youth ? not really , it seems			1
@entity0 never prepared for those 90 minute trips from @entity47			1
he just came to have fun			0
this time he has done the road work , the thousand sit - ups a day , the hundreds of rounds of sparring against up - and - coming title contenders and he says : ‘ there is no pressure because of what could happen with @entity36			1
i am fully focussed on @entity58			0
i will be completely in the zone when we are in the ring			0
‘ i ’m back to how i felt a few years ago			1
@entity62 , fast , strong			0
i ’m not taking @entity14 lightly			1
i ’m not looking past him			0
only @entity11 predict what will happen but i am confident in myself			0
’ born a @entity64 , @entity0 turned back to religion when his wild lifestyle jeopardised his family life with his wife and five children			1
@entity0 throws a right - handed punch at @entity71 during their fight earlier this year he has never shied away from the topic and says : ‘ i ’m a friendly personality and always been very open about my life			1
i like to be among friends and to share the word of @entity11 with people			0
’ with his redemption secure , he feels the power returning to his fists , adding : ‘ i have worked to bring back the early days , those when i was at my best and finished fights early			0
’ at 35 , he says he feels 26 again			2
there was talk of distraction when , as a @entity38 congressman , he announced his intention to run for his country ’s senate			1
then , as a 5ft 5in boxer , he took over a basketball team and became not only the shortest but the oldest rookie to take to the professional court			0
the light welterweight champion recently took time off from training to play in his first basketball game but trainer @entity99 affirms : ‘ we negotiated an agreement			0
i know @entity0 needs to be busy in many areas so we gave him a pass for one basketball game and then he commited to training for this fight the way he used to in what people regard as his prime			1
now he ’s as ready as he ’s ever been			0
’ if they are right , this is bad news for @entity14			2
not that he appears unnerved			0
he displays not an ounce of doubt that he can pull off one of the prize - ring ’s major upsets			2
nor , perhaps , should he after winning his title by climbing off the canvas twice in the first round against renowned puncher @entity122 to claim a hard - fought 12 - round decision			2
@entity0 is the only boxer in history to be a world champion in eight different weight divisions @entity14 is a likeable , persuasive talker who says : ‘ @entity0 is one of the greats but i have the skills to defeat him			1
’ this will be only the 21st fight for a 30 - year - old of @entity136 - @entity135 extract who still lives in the basement of his parents ’ house in @entity141 , @entity142 , and plans to continue qualifying to become a doctor when he finishes with the fisticuffs			2
at which , the @entity0 smiles in that unassuming way of his			2
kindly , but convinced he holds all the chips			0
and utterly impervious to the temptations of the vast gaming floor at the @entity150			0
@entity153 will be televised live in @entity154 on @entity155 late saturday night .			2

@entity0 will fight @entity23 @entity14 on saturday in @entity1
@entity0 , *33* , said he felt as fit as he did when he was 26 - years - old
the @entity38 is hoping to set up a clash with @entity36 in 2015
@entity0 used to enjoy a wild lifestyle , but then became religious
