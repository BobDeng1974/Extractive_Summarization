by @entity0 published : 15:54 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 16:21 est , 18 march 2012 delighted : @entity1 was told by doctors she had less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally			1
but in december last year she gave birth to twins			2
she is pictured here with husband @entity7 and babies @entity9 and @entity10 for many women , a thoughtful card from their son or daughter is enough to make them feel extra special on @entity16			1
but for one woman , just being able to call herself a mother is more than enough			1
@entity1 was told by doctors she had less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally			1
but she is now celebrating her first ever @entity16 - as the proud mum of twins			2
with her husband @entity7 , the couple were told by doctors that it would be practically impossible for them to conceive naturally			2
they went through more than two years of tests at the @entity29 before they were stunned to discover mrs @entity1 was pregnant with twins			1
and in december last year , babies @entity9 and @entity10 arrived safely			1
the couple , from @entity33 , @entity34 , had not been planning to start a family for a few years			2
but doctors told them that @entity1 had polycystic ovaries and , while her husband had a good sperm count , they were told it might need a little help in moving towards her eggs			1
they were told there was less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally			2
once fertility treatment had been mentioned the couple decided that they should consider starting a family earlier			2
mrs @entity1 said : ' when you are younger you just assume that when you want a child you will have one , that you might try for a couple of months and will be pregnant			1
' my husband and i said we would wait until we were 30 but then things were sped up a little bit			0
' i am ever so glad that we found out because lots of people try for years and years before they realise			0
' mrs @entity1 was given drugs that might improve her fertility , but after a year the couple decided to try a procedure called intrauterine insemination ( @entity65 )			1
the procedure involved the business advisor being given hormones so they could be sure of when her egg would be released			0
the sperm is then prepared and inserted directly into the womb			0
happy : the couple look on adoringly at their twin babies			0
they have told how grateful they are to the @entity77 for helping them start a family they were told that they could have three rounds of the treatment funded by the @entity77 and on the second attempt she became pregnant with her twin daughters			0
she added : ' with the first round we had done everything to the letter			0
i gave up coffee did n't eat certain foods and when it did n't work it was quite disappointing			0
' i started to resign myself to the fact we might not have any children and started to relax a lot more and then we heard in april			0
' the couple had gone on a cruise to take a break after all the journeys back and forth to @entity102 for treatment and tests and did a pregnancy test while they were away			0
mrs @entity1 said the second round of insemination had almost been cancelled because they were not sure it would work so the news of her pregnancy was all the more special			1
the first scan was carried out at six weeks and the couple spotted what looked like ' two grains of rice ' but would not believe they were their twins until further into the pregnancy after the arrival of the twins the couple sent a thank - you card to the @entity29 thanking them for their efforts and the time that consultants spent talking through their options			0
' the treatment was outstanding , from the communication through to the technical procedures , ' mrs @entity1 said			1
' we are really grateful for having the @entity77			0

@entity1 is now the proud mother of @entity9 and @entity10
