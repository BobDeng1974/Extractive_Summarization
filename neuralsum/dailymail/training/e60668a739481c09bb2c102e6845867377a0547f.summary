by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 4 april 2013 racehorses have better lives than some children , according to a jockey tipped to win the @entity5 this weekend			1
@entity6 , due to ride second favourite @entity7 in saturday ’s meeting , was defending the race against those who label it barbaric			1
two horses , including the favourite @entity14 , died in last year 's running at @entity16			2
since then further welfare changes , including a new fence design , have been made			1
@entity6 was defending the @entity5 against those who say it is barbaric @entity6 came third in last year 's @entity16 meeting and is one of the favourites to win on saturday however , @entity6 believes that horse deaths should be put in perspective when compared to the fall that left @entity28 jockey @entity27 paralysed at the @entity29 last month			1
@entity6 , whose brother @entity30 will ride favourite on his own , said : ‘ anyone who gets up on @entity35 and mucks out loves animals			1
sure , it ’s a dangerous sport but every night , all over the world , a lot of horses are left out in fields starving			2
@entity27 was left paralysed after he fell from his horse at @entity29 ‘ these horses are so well looked after			2
better than some children , to be honest with you			2
‘ i do n’t read the criticism because it ’s not worth it			0
at the end of the day it would be a lot worse if it had been two jockeys who lost their lives			0
i think everyone should remember that			0
’ in an interview with @entity56 , @entity6 added : ‘ i hope to @entity57 there are no accidents this year , but these things happen , and they ’re horses at the end of the day			1
‘ i do n’t mean that in a cruel way , but to see @entity63 get a horrible fall at @entity29 … he ’s gone from the neck down , and that ’s a different deal altogether in my eyes			0
’ @entity68 , the director of welfare charity @entity70 , told the @entity72 : ' obviously we have a duty of care to look after animals but it does n't compare to the duty of care we have for our children			0
' racehorses , while not exploited , are still tools that are being used for commercial use			0
' when children are used in the same way , on shows like the @entity86 , when their emotions are seen very publicly , the consequences are not very pleasant			0
i do n't think making comparisons help either cause			0
' @entity6 achieved the best @entity5 finish for a female jockey when third last year on @entity93 , a horse trained by her father @entity95			1
changes to the course by @entity16 bosses include replacing the solid wood cores of all fences with plastic or birch , which is softer on the horse and moving the race starting point away from the noise of the grandstand to stop the horses getting overwhelmed			1
chance : @entity6 will team up with @entity7 for saturday 's famous race the racecard order of the horses will be arranged in the parade ring instead of in front of spectators in the stands			1
security is also being reviewed by police , who fear extreme animal rights groups may try to disrupt the meeting			0
there are peaceful protests planned by @entity124 and @entity125 in @entity126 .			0
