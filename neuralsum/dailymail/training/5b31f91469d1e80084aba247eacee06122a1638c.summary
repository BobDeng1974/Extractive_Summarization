@entity0 gives testimony at court in may			0
his bid for a retrial in his armed robbery and kidnapping case has been rejected @entity0 faces at least four more years in prison after a judge yesterday rejected his bid for a new trial in his @entity13 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction			1
his legal team argued he had not received a fair trial in 2008 and that his original attorney had botched the case			1
however @entity19 district judge @entity18 said in her ruling : ' all grounds in the petition lack merit and , consequently , are denied			1
' @entity25 's lawyer @entity24 said she spoke briefly with the former football star from prison , and said he was disappointed but would appeal to the @entity28			1
she said : ' we 're confident that when we get to the right court we 'll get relief because he deserves relief , because he did n't get a fair trial			2
' if the 66 - year - old @entity25 loses his appeal to the state high court , he could take the case to federal courts to argue his constitutional right to effective counsel was violated			2
@entity25 was found guilty of kidnapping , armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room			1
@entity25 was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in @entity53 state prison but was granted parole on some convictions in july , meaning he must serve at least four more years locked up			1
@entity19 district attorney @entity57 , whose wife was the judge who presided over the @entity60 trial , called @entity18 's ruling the right decision			2
' i believe mr @entity0 received a fair trial and had more than competent counsel , ' @entity57 said			1
@entity25 's conviction came 13 years to the day after the former movie and tv star was acquitted in the @entity69 ' trial of the century ' in the stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , @entity25 , and her friend @entity72			1
six years later , a jury in @entity74 acquitted him of all charges in a @entity77 road rage case			0
@entity25 's legal defense in his @entity13 trial was headed by @entity81 , the @entity74 - based attorney who represented him in the 2001 road rage case			1
attorney @entity84 served with @entity81 as co-counsel in @entity13			0
@entity81 , who testified during @entity25 's five - day habeas corpus hearing in may , said he felt vindicated			1
his legal team had argued that his previous attorney had botched the case and he was not given a fair trial @entity25 's lawyer at the 2008 trial @entity81 , right , has defended his performance on his client 's behalf and calls the claims a ' charade ' ' as @entity0 's lawyer and confidante , it was gut - wrenching for me to have to be in a position to defend my strategy and efforts on his behalf as his lawyer and testify against my client , ' @entity81 said			1
' if i did what their legal team says i did , the first thing @entity0 should have said to me was , " hey i 'm in jail and it 's because of you			1
" ' @entity18 's 101 - page ruling rejected arguments that @entity25 had received inadequate legal representation			1
' mr @entity0 's convictions stem from serious offenses , ' she wrote			0
the judge noted the involvement of six co-conspirators and weeks of advance planning			0
' mr @entity0 specifically asked two of his co-conspirators to bring weapons ... to show the sellers he meant business , ' she said			0
and the two memorabilia dealers were ' lured into a small hotel room ' where they were surprised by @entity25 's group			2
the judge considered a 94 - page petition for a new trial			0
@entity25 's new legal team - @entity24 , @entity137 and @entity138 - said they believed they presented overwhelming evidence that @entity81 knew of @entity25 's plan , had conflicted interests that shaped the way he handled the case , and that @entity25 did n't get a fair trial			1
mr @entity81 said he felt vindicated by the judge 's rejection of @entity25 retrial bid they said @entity81 failed to hire an investigator or have experts examine crucial evidence , including audio tapes that jurors later said convinced them of @entity25 's guilt			1
@entity25 's lawyers sought to show that @entity81 advised @entity25 it was ok to take back his items and should have stepped aside so he could be called as a witness for @entity25 's defense			2
instead , they said , @entity81 advised @entity25 not to testify and reached a pretrial agreement with prosecutors not to enter evidence into the trial record of phone calls that raised questions about whether he had knowledge of the heist			2
@entity25 , pictured at the 2008 trial , will appeal to the @entity28 finally , @entity25 's legal team said that by handling the appeal , @entity81 nearly precluded @entity25 from ever arguing he had ineffective counsel			1
a shackled @entity25 spent an entire day in may testifying for the first time in the case			0
@entity25 , noticeably grayer and heavier after five years in prison , said he believes @entity81 misled him , including telling him it was ok to retrieve the family photos and memorabilia he thought had been stolen from him after his acquittal in @entity69 in 1995			1
@entity25 said @entity81 advised him that it was his legal right to retrieve personal items as long as no force was used and no one trespassed			1
' it was my stuff , ' @entity25 said			0
' i followed what i thought was the law			0
my lawyer told me i could n't break into a guy 's room			0
i did n't break into anybody 's room			0
i did n't try to muscle the guys			0
' during his parole hearing in july , @entity25 said he was sorry for his actions and said he had made amends with the two memorabilia dealers			2
@entity81 dramatically contradicted @entity25 's account			2
he testified he was surprised when @entity25 told him that he and several other men were planning a ' sting ' the next morning			0
the attorney denied giving @entity25 the go - ahead to try to retrieve the items			2
' i said , " @entity0 , you 've got to call the police , " ' @entity81 testified			0
@entity81 disputed the claim that @entity25 was never informed about plea bargain discussions with prosecutors that could have resulted in a prison sentence of just a few years			2
@entity81 also testified that @entity25 later confided to him that he knew some of the five men with him the night of the robbery had guns			0
@entity25 maintains to this day that he never asked anyone to bring guns or saw weapons in the cramped hotel room			0
' mr. @entity0 never told me he was going to go to the @entity224 ) hotel with a bunch of thugs , kidnap people and take property by force , ' @entity81 said			0
' to insinuate i , as his lawyer , would have blessed it is insane			0

former footballer 's team argued he had not received a fair trial in 2008
said his then attorney @entity81 had a conflict of interest in the case that *changed* the way he handled it
but judge rejected bid and said ' all grounds in the petition lack merit '
@entity25 was jailed for up to 33 years for his ' attempt to retrieve memorabilia ' from two sports dealers
his legal team said he will now appeal to @entity28
