two kittens have been saved ( right ) after they were covered in yellow paint ( left ) and abandoned in a cardboard box at the side of the road in @entity5 she said : ' when i opened it up i saw the two kittens inside covered in sticky yellow paint			1
' it had almost dried and their legs were stuck together , they were stuck together , and even their eyes had been closed by the paint			0
' they were really in a pitiful state so i picked the box up and took them home where i tried to clean off some of the paint			0
' but the 27 - year - old was unable to remove the paint and took the animals to a vet who had to cut off their fur			2
the sticky paint had dried and stuck the kittens ' legs together , as well as matting their fur and covering their eyes a vet painstakingly cut the paint - covered fur off both the kittens , which took several hours			2
they were then wrapped in tiny blankets a spokesman for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) said : ' slapping paint on animals is terribly cruel and could cause allergic reactions , blood poisoning and other life - threatening complications , including suffocation			0
' unfortunately , this type of abuse is legal in @entity5 , where there are no penalties for abusing animals			0
' @entity65 regularly communicates with municipal governments in @entity5 in an effort to implement better animal welfare legislation , including dispelling myths about rabies and assisting with other animal control issues			0
' miss @entity13 added : ' the kittens are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears			2
' but they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut - off			1

but they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut - off ' ' they are very resilient and despite the bad start in life they are already starting to play around with each other like ordinary kittens			1
