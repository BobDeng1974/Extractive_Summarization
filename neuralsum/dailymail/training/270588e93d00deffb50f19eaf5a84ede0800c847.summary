a public transit system that still uses metal tokens and paper transfers - yes , in the 21st century - appears finally to be moving into the era of debit cards and pay - by - cellphone technology			1
@entity7 riders can now see evidence of @entity9 , the long - awaited smart card system for the @entity11			1
dozens of computerized kiosks , turnstiles and fare boxes have popped up in stations and on vehicles , and testing begins this month			1
what exactly does ' last place ' mean ? let 's start with @entity7 being one of the few cities in @entity35 to still use tokens for buses , subways and trolleys			1
@entity40 stopped selling them in 1999 , followed by @entity42 in 2003 and @entity43 in 2006			1
( though @entity44 continues to use them			0
) however , @entity9 does n't have token machines at every station , and cashiers are n't always on duty			1
when they are , they do n't necessarily sell tokens ; sometimes , they just accept exact change for the $ 2.25 cash fare - which , by the way , is higher than the $ 1.80 token cost			1
oh , and token machines do n't take credit cards			1
this is how the nation 's sixth - largest transportation system operates ? incredibly , the answer is yes			0
frustrating : @entity9 does n't have token machines at every station , and cashiers are n't always on duty overhaul : howeveer , the public transport authority says @entity66 , when fully implemented , will be the most comprehensive and seamless fare system in the @entity68 , offering multiple payment options which leaves a lot of ground to cover to reach ' first place			1
' but officials say that @entity66 , when fully implemented , will be the most comprehensive and seamless fare system in the @entity68 , offering multiple payment options and integration with commuter trains			2
every subway station will have kiosks that accept credit and debit cards			2
riders with microchipped bank cards or a cellphone app can pay right at the turnstile or bus fare box			2
and forget about those paper bus transfers - @entity66 cards recognize connected trips and deduct accordingly			0
@entity9 has been promising the changes at least as far back as 2007 but did n't award the $ 130 million contract until 2011			0
the program was delayed by funding problems such as reductions in state aid and other mandated safety spending , agency spokeswoman @entity92 said			0
@entity9 officials are coy about when customers will finally get @entity100 to the system ; they say only that it should roll out in 2015 and be completed the following year			0
that 's comparable to the five years it took @entity43 to fully deploy its charliecard system			1
the key card ca n't come soon enough for @entity107			0
the subway station closest to her west @entity7 home does n't have a token machine , and the cashier booth is n't staffed during off - peak hours			1
' i just find that really frustrating , ' said @entity114 , 31			0
' i do n't know why there are n't token machines everywhere			2
' @entity9 does sell weekly and monthly passes that commuters can swipe in turnstiles and fare boxes			1
but they ca n't be renewed ; riders have to wait in line to purchase new ones from an attendant at the start of each week or month			2
with the new system , those passes will be available - and renewable - at any kiosk , anytime			0
final farewell : metal tokens are still used by 22per cent of riders , according to @entity9 officials timeline : @entity9 officials are coy about when customers will finally get @entity100 to the system ; they say only that it should roll out in 2015 and be completed the following year @entity136 , who recently moved to @entity7 , still ca n't believe his credit cards are useless in the current arcane system			1
he recently paid $ 5 to ride the subway because he had no tokens and the booth attendant would n't make change			2
' what business in @entity35 does n't give change to its customers ? ' he said			1
@entity92 acknowledged the custom is cumbersome for riders , but she said it 's efficient for @entity9			0
@entity136 longs for the metrocards he previously used in @entity42 , which he could load with money and use it at his leisure			1
' i just want a @entity9 pass with $ 100 on it , ' he said			0
that will happen eventually , and @entity136 will even be able to add value to the card online			0
for now , he 's better off stocking up on tokens , which are still used by 22per cent of riders , according to @entity9 officials			2
the agency has n't yet announced a phase - out date for tokens			0
as troublesome as they can be , @entity114 has a soft spot in her heart for the metal coins			0
she and her boyfriend even dressed up as a token and token machine for @entity171 - whimsical costumes that brought a lot of attention on the street and on social media			0
' we thought , " we have to do it this year because next year the tokens may be gone , " ' @entity114 said .			0
