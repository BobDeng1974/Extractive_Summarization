a @entity1 cleric has publicly claimed that the @entity2 is a static object which is orbited by the sun , adding that centuries of evidence to the contrary is little more than fabrication			1
@entity9 is believed to have been speaking at a university lecture in the @entity11 when a student asked him whether the @entity2 rotates or is stationary			2
the @entity14 scholar quickly replies ' stationary and does not move ' , before launching into a long - winded and confusing explanation that appears to the suggest that if the @entity2 was moving , airliners would never be able to reach their destination			1
perhaps struggling to make his argument understood , the religious lecturer then attempts to use a visual aid to illustrate how difficult it would be for airliners to travel if the @entity2 is spinning			2
beginning his bizarre summary , @entity32 of all , where are we now ? we go to @entity34 [ in the @entity11 ] to travel to @entity35 by plane , clear ? ' holding a cup of water aloft , the cleric adds : ' focus with me , this is @entity2 '			0
over the next 30 seconds , @entity20 enters into a baffling explanation of his point of view , claiming that if the @entity2 truly was rotating , then airliners could just stop in the air and wait for the country to arrive beneath them , rather than waste time actually flying			1
' @entity35 would be coming towards it , ' he argues			0
on the other hand , he said , if the @entity2 was moving in the opposite direction the plane would never be able to reach its destination because ' @entity35 is also rotating '			2
struggle : in an effort to make his argument understood , the religious lecturer attempts to explain that it would be difficult for airliners to travel around the world if the @entity2 was always spinning away from them on concluding his baffling explanation , @entity20 went on to claim the @entity64 lunar mission was @entity66 fabrication and that humans have never been to the moon , according to @entity69			1
video of the incident has inevitably proved a hit on social media , where users started an @entity76 - language hashtag that translates as # @entity77			0
one user pointed out that the footage first appeared february 15 - the 451th anniversary of @entity82 's birth			0
@entity82 was famously twice accused of heresy by the @entity84 after publicly supporting the @entity86 theory that the @entity2 and other planets rotate around the sun. while many are using the hashtag to mock @entity20 's views , others said it should be turned into a way to educate young people about the universe .			0
