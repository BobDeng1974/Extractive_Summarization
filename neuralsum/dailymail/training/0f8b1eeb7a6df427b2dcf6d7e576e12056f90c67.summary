by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 15 august 2013 tv star @entity1 stepped in to stop a ' nonsensical ' operation on his wife using medical knowledge gleaned from his nine years playing grumpy gp @entity5			1
the actor , who made his name on @entity9 , stopped a surgeon taking out @entity12 's appendix ' because it was the wrong thing to do '			1
the 51 - year - old also admitted medics may have actually thought he was @entity15 doctor @entity7 because they handed him his wife 's medical notes when he arrived to visit her in hospital			1
you ca n't just make things up as they do on @entity31 shows			0
' so we have a medical expert on the series and i have learned about certain conditions and procedures , ' he told @entity39			1
mr @entity1 married his second wife @entity40 in 1997 , who is producer on @entity5 , which has been running since 2004			1
he has said he had to get involved when doctors said they wanted to carry out what he described as a ' nonsensical ' operation			2
he said : ' she had an infection in her gall bladder and the surgeon was minded to take out her appendix			0
there was no infection in her appendix and instinct told me that it would be the wrong thing to do			1
so i took her home instead and she was treated there			0
' as @entity22 's husband , it was my prerogative to do this			0
but when i was chatting to hospital staff they handed me her medical notes to look at in a way they might not have with an ordinary member of the public			2
' i do wonder whether there was n't some confusion between me and @entity5			2
' mistaken identity : ' @entity5 ' deals with a collapsed patient on screen , but mr @entity1 admitted hospital staff may have confused him with the character after they handed him his wife 's medical notes when he arrived to see her but it is not the first time he has saved the day			1
in 2011 the actor came to the aid of a baby boy who played his newborn son in the tv series and who needed urgent funds for vital medical equipment			0
@entity91 , who when six - months - old played the @entity6 ’s newborn baby @entity92 , has a rare condition which means he can not support his head			0
he also has a misshapen skull , which could cause serious complications if left untreated			0
his parents @entity98 and @entity99 needed to raise £ 2,000 to pay for a helmet which can strengthen @entity91 ’s muscles and reshape his skull as it grows			0
but after hearing of @entity91 ’s plight , @entity1 donated hundreds of pounds worth of memorabilia to be auctioned off to pay for it			2

medics wanted @entity12 's appendix out but @entity111 *intervened*
mr @entity1 said it was the wrong thing to do ' and took her home instead
@entity117 thinks they thought he was ' @entity5 ' because they gave him medical notes
' we *'ve* a expert and i have learned about certain procedures , ' he said
