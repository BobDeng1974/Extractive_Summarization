a veteran of @entity2 's failed presidential campaign unveiled a new slogan this weak meant to humanize the @entity6 's image , but older republicans may experience a shudder of wary recognition upon hearing it			1
' republicans are people , too , ' reads the new promotional material including a video , web site , and social media campaign , launched by @entity6 @entity16 , and repeating the same slogan meant to make the brand more friendly in 1974 in the wake of the @entity20			1
@entity16 decided to revive the slogan because he believes that it has become ' socially acceptable to say bad things about @entity6 ' and that it 's time to ' let people know that it 's ok to be a @entity6			1
' a new campaign slogan meant to humanize @entity6 members has a sad history in the party after the @entity20 scandal ' people , i 'm afraid , think that @entity6 spend their days huddling over a boiling cauldron throwing in locks of @entity38 's hair , ' he told @entity39			1
' we thought let 's get out there and show who @entity6 really are : ' regular folks interested in making the world a better place			2
' he added that , like the @entity6 in his campaign videos , he himself shops at @entity50 's and reads the @entity52			2
an executive at @entity55 consulting firm , he says he came up with the idea on his own seeing @entity6 lambasted on the internet			0
@entity6 @entity16 came up with the slogan without knowing its history , saying he was inspired by seeing @entity6 treated badly online ' a big part of the idea is from my life experience as a @entity6 online , ' he said			1
' i 've been called a lot of really bad things			0
it seems like it has become socially acceptable to say bad things about @entity6			0
' however speaking to @entity72 , @entity38 biographer and political consultant @entity74 said the slogan was originally received as ' the wail of pathetic losers			1
' he had already addressed the campaign 's failure in his book @entity82 , comparing the 1974 @entity6 to a ' stray cat ' people would like to ' immediately ' euthanize			1
he further mocked the campaign material for the then ' party of losers ' writing : ' as if to remove all doubt about the @entity6 's insecurities and cowardice , the buttons were manufactured in bright yellow			2
' @entity38 biographer and political consultant @entity74 said a similar campaign was originally received as ' the wail of pathetic losers ' the @entity97 spokesmen contacted by reporters about the slogan did not respond to interview requests			1
@entity16 said he had no idea his campaign slogan was a repeat of the infamous tagline			2
' that 's a little before my time , ' he told @entity72			0
' i 'll have to go back and take a look at it			0
those were some pretty dark times for republicans for sure			0
' he says he still has faith in the slogan despite its checkered history , and thinks the video could help with voter registration			0
' i 've heard from a lot of campaigns who say it 's a breath of fresh air , especially this time of year			0
if you 're in a competitive state it 's just one negative ad after another , ' he said .			0

slogan was originally used following the @entity20 in 1974
@entity131 campaign adman @entity16 said he came up with the slogan seeing @entity6 berated online and was *unaware* of its history
*longtime* political *strategist* @entity74 said the slogan was poorly received in the *70s* and that it appeared pathetic at the time
