@entity0 is confident he can avoid the ' mistakes ' he feels have been made by other new teams ahead of entering @entity3 in 2016			1
of the three marques that made their bow in the sport in 2010 , @entity5 have already folded , @entity4 are on the brink of going to the wall , whilst @entity11 continue to struggle financially			1
@entity0 , who runs a successful team in @entity14 's @entity13 , has already been told he is crazy for trying to break into @entity3 , but has belief he will make it on to the grid in 17 months ' time			1
@entity0 ( above ) is sure his idea to enter @entity3 is viable , saying he will learn from mistakes of others ' i guess i do n't have any doubts we can do it , ' said @entity0 , speaking to @entity26			1
' people keep saying , ' well , you 're going to fail ' , but to me it 's just a challenge you need to do			1
' i know it 's a hard , but just do n't give up			0
you just keep banging your head against the wall until you open the door			0
' @entity0 was granted his entry earlier this year , but opted against a 2015 start date , believing the additional year would ensure he and his team would be fully prepared			2
that is where he feels the likes of @entity5 , @entity4 and @entity11 stumbled as they only had six months to put together a team and build their cars			1
@entity0 ( right ) runs a successful @entity14 @entity13 side but now is set to break into @entity3 in 2016 ' the biggest problem they had , in trying to get to the grid so fast , they wound up having to take on partnerships that maybe were n't thoroughly thought out , ' added @entity0			1
' they wound up making a lot of mistakes			0
inevitably they did n't have the resources , or the cars were n't properly put together , because they rushed things			0
' one route @entity0 has taken is to form a partnership with @entity58 who will supply the power trains and other key parts , further adding credence to his team 's entry			2
that , however , has led to suggestions @entity0 will be nothing more than a ' b team ' for @entity58 , although it is a comment he appreciates			2
' @entity58 were more accommodating			0
surprisingly they wanted to go beyond just being an engine supplier , ' said @entity0			2
' they were going to help us with a lot of the basic structure of the car			0
@entity0 is not put off from competing by the financial struggles of sides such as @entity11 ( above ) @entity4 ( front ) entered @entity3 in 2010 but are now expected to fold due to money issues ' and we 'd be very proud to be a @entity58 ' b ' team because that would certainly teach us how to run in @entity3			1
' quite frankly we will take all the help they can give us because you ca n't get any better than @entity58			0
' @entity0 , though , is aware of the struggles he will encounter once he is up and running , which is why he is not setting his sights high			0
asked to define a successful time in @entity3 , @entity0 replied : ' in the first five years it 's just surviving			1
' i do n't have expectations of grandeur we are going to go out there and win championships			0
' if we can even win one race in five years then i think that would be a tremendous success			0

@entity0 sure he can avoid errors he felt others made when entering @entity3
feels extra motivation when he is told by people that he is going to fail
@entity5 have folded , @entity4 seem set to follow and both *joined* in 2010
