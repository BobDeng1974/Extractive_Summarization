scientists have identified a biological clock that could help predict a person 's lifespan			1
researchers studied chemical changes to @entity6 to establish an individual 's biological age which they compared with their actual age			1
they found that people whose biological age was greater than their true age were more likely to die sooner than those whose biological and actual ages were the same			1
people whose biological age was greater than their true age were more likely to die sooner than those whose biological and actual ages were the same , a study found four independent studies tracked the lives of almost 5,000 older people for up to 14 years			1
each person 's biological age was measured from a blood sample at the outset , and participants were followed up throughout the study			1
four independent studies tracked the lives of almost 5,000 older people for up to 14 years			0
each person 's biological age was measured from a blood sample at the outset and participants were followed up throughout the study			1
researchers found that the link between having a faster - running biological clock and early death held true even after accounting for other factors such as smoking , diabetes and cardiovascular disease			2
the study 's principal investigator , professor @entity37 , from the @entity39 's @entity40 and @entity41 , said : ' this new research increases our understanding of longevity and healthy ageing			2
' it is exciting as it has identified a novel indicator of ageing , which improves the prediction of lifespan over and above the contribution of factors such as smoking , diabetes and cardiovascular disease			2
' the study involved scientists from the @entity39 in collaboration with researchers in @entity60 and the @entity61			0
they measured each person 's biological age by studying a chemical modification to @entity6 , known as methylation			1
the modification does not alter the dna sequence but plays an important role in biological processes and can influence how genes are turned off and on			0
methylation changes can affect many genes and occur throughout a person 's life			0
researchers found that the link between having a faster - running biological clock and early death held true even after accounting for other factors such as smoking , diabetes and cardiovascular disease			0
dr @entity82 , of the @entity39 's @entity40 and @entity41 , said : ' the same results in four studies indicated a link between the biological clock and deaths from all causes			2
' at present , it is not clear what lifestyle or genetic factors influence a person 's biological age			1
we have several follow - up projects planned to investigate this in detail			0
' the study is published in the journal @entity99			0
it was conducted by researchers from the @entity39 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 ( @entity106 ) , @entity107 , the @entity108 and the @entity109 .			0

chemical changes to @entity6 can establish an individual 's biological age
compared with their actual age it can *reveal* their lifespan
if biological age was greater than real age more likely to die soon
