@entity1 militants fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 have been provided with a chilling list of dos and don'ts explaining how to treat the thousands of sex slaves held in the terror group 's prison - brothels			1
a document issued earlier this month by the group 's ' @entity11 and women 's affairs ' explains in sickening detail exactly who can be made a sex slave , when a woman should be beaten , and under what circumstances it is justified to rape prepubescent girls			1
up to 5,000 kidnapped women and children are held as sex slaves in the vast swathes of @entity2 and @entity3 controlled by @entity24 , many of them in the group 's stronghold and @entity27			1
the vast majority of the captives are members of the @entity32 religion who were kidnapped during the @entity35 massacre in early august			1
the rules state that these women can be imprisoned and raped on a daily basis by militants who purchase them as slaves for as little as £ 27 each			2
the department , headed by a militant known as @entity68 , helps the terror group enforce policy decisions made by the @entity71 - a kind of religious advisory body appointed by leader @entity74 to study the @entity75 and make rulings based on their interpretation of sharia law			0
taking the form of a ' slavery for @entity47 ' guide , the document is laid out in a distinctly simplistic question and answer format designed to assist even the least intelligent jihadi in his slave treatment			0
the @entity89 - based @entity88 obtained an original copy of the document , and published full details of it on the monitoring group 's website			0
answers are provided to sickening questions such as ' is it permissible to have intercourse with a female captive immediately after taking possession ? ' , and ' if the female captive was impregnated by her owner , can he then sell her ? '			0
horror : the vast majority of the captives are members of the @entity32 religion who were kidnapped during the @entity35 massacre in early august			1
this young woman is one of the lucky few who managed to escape while @entity24 ' sale of oil on the @entity115 black market has long been known , far less has been written about the terror group 's import taxes and sale of antiques			2
@entity24 is believed to generate several million pounds a day , with approximately £ 400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil			0
a further £ 250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control , while @entity24 also makes money from farming , water services and electricity production			0
revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate , but the price for release is usually millions of pounds			0
companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under @entity24 ' control - with lorries charged £ 500 per journey , plus a further £ 250 tax for electronic good and £ 200 for food parcels			2
however one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command			0
for example , one @entity3 intelligence official claimed that @entity24 earned £ 23 million in early 2014 alone by selling £ 8,00 items stolen from the ancient city of @entity165 near @entity166			0
according to the document , slave women are known as @entity169 by @entity24 militants , and can only be taken from ' ahl al - harb ' - any group of people with which the terror groups considers itself at war			1
it goes on to make detailed cases for why polytheists and ' @entity179 ' such as @entity180 and @entity181 are permissible to take as slaves , but explains the @entity1 ' leans toward accepting the consensus view ' among @entity185 scholars that ex-muslims are not allowed to be captured			2
the rape of a female captive , the document explains , is perfectly acceptable even for married men			1
it then uses a passage from the @entity75 , which says @entity194 rewards @entity195 who are chaste with everybody other their wives and ' those their right hands possess '			0
the @entity24 guide claims the above ' right hands ' statement is a reference to captured women			1
one chilling passage in @entity24 ' sex slave document explains that virgins can be raped immediately after their ' owners ' purchase them			1
those who have previously had sexual intercourse must have their uterus ' ' purified ' first			0
another line says it is legal to have sex with a prepubescent child providing she is ' fit for intercourse			0
' there is no further explanation as to what such a horrific statement may mean			0
@entity32 ( pictured ) - whose belief system mixes elements from a range of religions and whose central figure of worship is a ' @entity226 ' - are believed to be satanists by fighters loyal to the @entity1 terror group @entity230 : according to the document , slave women are known as @entity169 by @entity24 militants ( pictured ) and can only be taken from ' ahl al - harb ' - any group of people with which the terror groups considers itself at war the document was released as it emerged dozens of young @entity241 women are using social media to boast of joining the @entity1 's terrifying all - female police force – claiming to be doling out savage beatings , punishment lashings , ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of @entity32 sex slaves are imprisoned and raped daily after being sold for as little as £ 27			1
britons including privately - educated @entity250 , 20 , and @entity252 - born @entity251 , 22 , are understood to have joined the @entity253 in @entity24 ' @entity254 , helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes			2
the group , which is largely made - up of educated @entity261 women , operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in @entity265 - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that are n't black , or those wearing veils made from the wrong material			2
one woman notorious for the references to the @entity274 is @entity241 national @entity275 , who also calls herself @entity276			0
earlier this year she described a chilling encounter with a @entity32 ' slave girl '			2
@entity275 claims she entered a building in the city of @entity27 and greeted the entire room			0
she then described in sickeningly mocking tones how the abused @entity32 sex slave offered a ' salam ' [ hello ] in response			1
sex slaves are believed to be controlled by an all - female police force known as the @entity274 in @entity24 stronghold and de facto capital city @entity265			1
one woman notorious for references to the brigade is @entity241 national @entity275			0
she uploaded this photograph of herself to @entity292 earlier this year sick : @entity293 recently described an encounter with a @entity32 sex slave in a mocking post on @entity292 @entity24 has attempted to justify the keeping of sex slaves by claiming that members of the @entity32 religion are devil worshippers - making them worse than so - called ' @entity179 ' such as @entity180 and @entity181 , who can escape imprisonment by paying a monthly tax known as jizyah			1
a woman aged 40 to 50 - 50,000 dinars ( £ 27 ) a woman aged 30 to 40 - 75,000 dinars ( £ 40 ) a woman aged 20 to 30 - 100,000 dinars ( £ 53 ) a girl , aged 10 to 20 - 150,000 dinars ( £ 80 ) a child under nine - 200,000 dinars ( £ 106 ) captured @entity32 - whose belief system mixes elements from a range of religions and whose central figure of worship is a ' @entity226 ' - are not able to pay their way out of jail , however			1
men and boys are told to convert to @entity185 or face immediate death , while women and children are often transported to @entity265 , where the @entity253 force them into sex slavery			2
earlier this month a chilling document emerged purporting to show the ' price list ' for sex slaves			1
according to the document , obtained by website @entity326 , just £ 27 will fetch a @entity32 or @entity180 woman aged between 40 and 50			1
chillingly , a child between one and nine will fetch four times that .			0
