hundreds of @entity0 invited to the @entity1 for military training are being sent home amid claims of rape , drunkenness , fighting and theft			1
the cadets – hand - picked by the @entity10 – were supposed to be given leadership skills to help their war - torn country			1
instead they have been allowed to run amok outside their @entity15 barracks , terrifying their neighbours			0
@entity1 troops have been drafted in to restore order			1
on their way home : 300 @entity0 troops training at @entity21 in @entity15 ( pictured ) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks worse still , @entity0 has failed to pay the bill for the programme			1
since the training course – which is backed by @entity26 – began in june : @entity27 , @entity0 ’s former prime minister , paid £ 2.5million to the @entity1 government but has claimed further payments were being blocked by @entity0 ’s @entity31 - led congress			1
in april , mr @entity26 wrote to mr @entity27 ’s successor , @entity32 , urging him to make the payments			0
upset : local mp @entity33 has said that the @entity34 has no other option but to ban any more visits the prime minister pledged the @entity1 ’s continuing support but added : ‘ i understand that you have been working personally to take forward the @entity40 and that plans are now advanced for some 360 recruits to come to the @entity1 in may			1
‘ i hope that it will be possible to resolve quickly the remaining issues relating to contract and payment , given the overall importance of this programme to our shared goal of improving stability and security			2
’ the call for extra troops to restore order came from police last week			2
units of the @entity57 , the @entity57 , were sent in to @entity21 , near @entity58 , after their leave was cancelled			2
last night , the @entity60 announced the 24 - week course was ending early and the 325 cadets would be sent home			1
the future of the entire programme – scheduled to cover 2,000 trainees – is in doubt amid protests from furious locals			1
@entity33 , a former @entity70 health secretary who had initially supported the scheme , said : ‘ as this stands , no further groups of trainees could be brought here from @entity0			1
’ he said the @entity34 must be held accountable for ‘ a serious failure ’			2
mr @entity33 said about 10 per cent of the cadets ‘ were not accepting the discipline and were n’t accepting what they were asked to do and were not becoming part of a military force ’			1
‘ they were looking to take whatever advantage they could , ’ he added			2
‘ it has meant recently that there has been a lot of additional resources by the @entity34 to try and shore it up and give protection			0
it is all very disappointing			0
we wanted it to work and for it to make a contribution in @entity0			2
’ the demand for answers came after @entity99 magistrates were told how three of the cadets had behaved ‘ like a pack ’ as they hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night			1
@entity104 , 20 , and @entity105 , 27 , left their barracks on stolen bicycles and cycled to @entity99 where they stalked their victims under the cover of darkness			2

@entity152 , who chairs the parish council , said : ‘ i thought @entity154 did n’t drink but there has been a run on vodka in the local shop			0
that ’s their favourite trip – going to the @entity160 and then stealing bicycles			0
’ @entity162 confirmed that the @entity0 soldiers are eligible to seek asylum in the @entity1 before they are kicked out			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ asylum rules apply to everyone			0
