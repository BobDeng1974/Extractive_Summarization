troubled retailer @entity3 is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons again after a federal judge ruled that the trendy clothing retailer wrongly fired a @entity9 worker who insisted on wearing a head scarf @entity16 , right , has won her discrimination lawsuit against @entity3 , while ceo @entity21 , left , has already had to apologize this year for his remarks that the company did not market to ‘ unattractive individuals ’ the @entity12 @entity39 filed a lawsuit on @entity16 's behalf in 2011			1
the company had claimed the head scarf violated its policy governing the look of its employees , which it said was part of its marketing strategy			1
the store argued that deviating from its look policy would affect sales			0
@entity16 was employed for several months , in 2009 and 2010			1
she said that when she was hired , a manager at the store , in @entity19 's @entity58 , said it was ok for her to wear the hijab as long as it was in company colours			1
but four months later she claims a district manager and human resources manager asked if she could remove the hijab while working			0
when she refused , she was suspended and then fired			2
problematic : in august @entity18 was found guilty of disability discrimination with its stepped store entrances , modeled after @entity20 beach shacks ( a store front in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ) the case was n't the first time the company has been charged with discriminating against @entity9 women over the wearing of a hijab			1
in 2009 , @entity79 , who was 17 at the time , filed a federal lawsuit in @entity81 , @entity82 , alleging the company rejected her for a job because she was wearing a hijab			1
also in 2009 a @entity87 employment tribunal awarded 22 - year - old @entity88 £ 8,000 after she claimed the firm banished her to the stockroom because she had a prosthetic arm			2
@entity3 has become well - known for its controversial ' look policy ' , which provides strict guidelines governing how employees dress			2
it stipulates staff must represent ' a natural classic @entity12 style '			0
the company instructs employees on everything from how to wear their hair ( clean and natural ) to how long they should wear their nails ( a quarter of an inch past the end of the finger )			2
but the policy has got them into trouble this year after a 2006 @entity108 interview with ceo , @entity21 went viral and caused widespread outcry			1
image conscious : @entity18 , like all of the @entity3 brands , markets its clothing as a lifestyle , its main inspiration being @entity20 's beach and surf scene the article highlighted @entity21 ' statements that @entity3 did not produce clothing for women larger than size 10 and purposefully did not market to ' unattractive ' individuals			1
' that 's why we hire good - looking people in our stores			2
because good - looking people attract other good - looking people , and we want to market to cool , good - looking people			0
we do n't market to anyone other than that , ' @entity21 had said in the 2006 interview			2
' in every school there are the cool and popular kids , and then there are the not - so - cool kids			0
candidly , we go after the cool kids			0
we go after the attractive all - american kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends			0
a lot of people do n't belong [ in our clothes ] , and they ca n't belong			0
are we exclusionary ? absolutely			0
' as the article gained momentum via @entity154 , the company 's official @entity150 site was bombarded by comments and posts against the strategy			1
@entity21 was forced to issued an official statement in may , 2013 , denying that the company discriminated against people			1
' i sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense , ' he said			0
' we are completely opposed to any discrimination , bullying , derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race , gender , body type or other individual characteristics			0
’ last month a federal judge ruled that @entity176 s surf - inspired clothing label @entity18 has until january 1 , 2017 , to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair - friendly then last month a federal judge ruled that @entity3 ’s surf - inspired clothing label @entity18 has until january 1 , 2017 , to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair - friendly			1
many of @entity18 's stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch and a lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the company of discriminating against disabled customers			1
the long - running case originally grew from complaints filed against two @entity18 stores in @entity73 by the @entity192			1
@entity193 , 45 , one of the plaintiffs in the four - year dispute , said she visited the @entity197 store , which has since closed , to buy items for her 12 - year - old daughter but her wheelchair could n’t make it up the steps			0
lawyers for the @entity204 , a national civil - rights organization , found similar access problems at @entity3 and @entity18 stores in nine @entity207 and filed a similar lawsuit in november 2009 in @entity209			1
in 2012 the @entity73 - focused case grew into a class - action suit targeting the 248 @entity18 stores across the @entity12 that feature imitation porch steps as a main entrance			1
despite the uproar , @entity18 vigorously defended the use of stairs in its stores			1
widespread : 248 hollister stores across the @entity12 currently feature faux porch steps as their main entrance a company spokesman said that the raised entrances were designed to create ' an entry to a house in @entity20 that you would walk up onto the porch or walk down into the porch , to enter , like you would do at a beach house			2
' the firm argued that it complies with the law because the stores include side doors disguised as shuttered windows that are wheelchair accessible			0
however plaintiffs said these doors are often are blocked with tables stacked with merchandise and they should not be made to enter through an ' inferior ' entrance			0
ms @entity193 , who was born without a sacrum - the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine - told the @entity245 : ' i would never go through a side door			0
it ’s not something i would do			0
i ’m philosophically opposed to that			0
' these stores are designed to look shuttered and hidden , as if to keep out the riffraff			0
i want people to know that , as a society , we have evolved over the past 25 years			0
' despite the fact that [ @entity18 ] market [ s ] beauty and athleticism as a stereotype , the reality is they still need the rest of us people who are short , chubby and maybe with acne and wheelchairs			2
' in march @entity12 district judge @entity268 agreed that @entity18 ’s inaccessible porches violate the @entity12 with @entity270 , also known as the @entity271			1
the 23 - year - old law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment , transportation , public accommodation , communications , and governmental activities			0
a federal judge has ruled that @entity16 she was sacked from her job at the @entity18 in this @entity20 shopping center for wearing a hijab in 2010 judge @entity268 ruled that customers who use wheelchairs must be entitled to the same experience as all other customers			1
he suggested that @entity18 could flatten out its entrance ways and remove the steps or install wheelchair - accessible ramps			2
commenting on the ruling , a spokesman for @entity18 told @entity295 ' we are surprised by the judge ’s decision that the @entity18 entrances are not compliant with the @entity271			1
' we ’ve maintained throughout the litigation , and continue to maintain , that the stores comply with the @entity271 and allow access to all patrons			0
' beyond that , we want all of our customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores			2
while we reserve the right to appeal the underlying legal issue , we are currently working with the court and the plaintiffs to reach a mutually agreeable resolution			0
' @entity18 , like all of the @entity3 brands , markets its clothing as a lifestyle , its main inspiration being @entity20 's beach and surf scene			1
the website explains that it is the ' coolest destination for genuine @entity20 style clothes for guys and girls			0
' and a 2013 report to shareholders reads : ' it ’s all about hot lifeguards and beautiful beaches … young and fun , with a sense of humor , @entity18 never takes itself too seriously			2
@entity18 ’s laid - back lifestyle and @entity336 image is timeless and effortlessly cool			2
' the @entity337 has also weighed in on the discrimination case			0
it highlighted that the @entity18 stores were built long after the @entity271 came into play and therefore the entrances violate both the ' spirit and letter of the law			1

a federal judge has found in favor of @entity16 who claimed she was fired for wearing a head scarf
the defeat is the latest in a series of embarrassing discrimination disputes involving the trendy clothing label
ceo @entity21 was forced in may to deny that the company discriminated after comments he made about ' unattractive individuals '
in august @entity3 's @entity18 brand lost a legal dispute that claimed the design of its stores discriminated against disabled customers
