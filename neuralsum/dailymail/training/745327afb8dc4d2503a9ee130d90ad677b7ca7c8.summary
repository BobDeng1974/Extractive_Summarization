a @entity1 man from @entity2 who went to terror training camps in @entity4 can not be deported because it is against his human rights			1
lawyers argued that 30 - year - old @entity8 , who can not be named for legal reasons , has weak ties to his homeland and his removal would breach his rights to a family life despite committing serious criminal offences			1
the man , who has been convicted of aggravated burglary among other charges , won his appeal against immediate removal back to @entity2 by three senior judges at @entity23 today			1
judges at @entity23 ruled that the man , known only as @entity8 , can not be deported due to human rights lord @entity27 , sir @entity28 and sir @entity29 ruled that @entity8 – a married father - of - three – was entitled to have his case reconsidered by tribunal			1
sir @entity29 said : ‘ it would in general be difficult to see that in the case of someone who had committed offences as serious as those of the appellant the lack of ties to his country of nationality would lead to a breach of his article 8 rights , since the public interest in his deportation is so strong			1
’ but the judge added that he was persuaded in this case to remit his appeal to the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) because of changes to relevant legislation and @entity57 since his case was last considered			2
lord @entity27 described how @entity8 began to seriously practise @entity59 - the religion of his birth - whilst detained at a youth offender institution			2
after his release on licence in 2005 he used to attend the @entity64 , and that led him to go to meetings at the house of a man called @entity69 ‘ whom @entity8 subsequently admitted was a fanatical @entity71 ’ , said the judge			2
‘ these encounters resulted in @entity8 attending two terrorist training camps [ in southern @entity4 ] in 2006			1
’ born in @entity2 in june 1984 , @entity8 came to the @entity75 with his mother and her other children in 1991 at the age of six			2
he obtained indefinite leave to remain when he was 16			0
lord justice @entity27 said : ‘ his mother and siblings have obtained @entity75 nationality , but @entity8 has not			2
‘ that is because he started to commit crimes when he was 14 , his age when he was convicted of robbery			0
’ he was subsequently convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he was 15 , three assaults on police constables when he was aged 18 , and aggravated burglary when 19			1
sir @entity29 ( pictured ) said he had been ' persuaded ' in this case to remit his appeal for the burglary offence he was sentenced at @entity95 in september 2003 to three years , six months in a youth offender institution			2
he was warned in a letter from the then home secretary that ‘ a serious view ’ was taken of the aggravated burglary offence and he was at risk of being deported if he was the subject of ‘ adverse notice ’ in the future			1
on the day of his release in march 2005 he married his wife in an @entity59 wedding ceremony and the couple have gone on to have three children			0
after a visit to the house of the ‘ fanatical @entity71 ’ and attending terrorist training camps he was arrested			1
@entity8 was charged under section 8 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the 2006 @entity115 which makes it an offence to attend a place where instruction or training , including with weapons , is given for terrorist purposes			2
he pleaded guilty to two charges and in february 2008 at @entity123 was sentenced to three years , five months in prison on each count , with the sentences running concurrently			0
but because @entity8 had been in custody since his arrest , he was released on licence in june 2008			0
the judge said that a month earlier he had been served with a deportation notice by the home secretary , stating that his presence in the @entity75 was ‘ not conducive to the public good ’ because of his terrorist - related convictions			0
an @entity57 and @entity136 ( @entity137 ) allowed @entity8 ’s initial appeal against the notice on human rights grounds in july 2009 , but the decision was overturned by the @entity54 ( @entity142 ) and a fresh hearing ordered			1
in may 2013 , the @entity54 heard evidence from ym and his wife and the mothers of the couple but rejected assertions that there was a real risk he would suffer inhuman and degrading treatment if sent back to @entity2 , contrary to @entity151 of the human rights convention			0
although the appeal judges dismissed his challenge to the decision under @entity151 , they ruled he was entitled to a rehearing by the tribunal on his @entity151 8 grounds			1
lord justice @entity27 said the @entity151 8 case raised issues over how revised @entity161 were to be applied to @entity8 ’s case , but the central question for the court was what ties ym himself had with @entity2 and whether they would support him if he was returned to that country			1
he declared the @entity54 had made three relevant errors of law on the issue and must now ‘ conduct a proper factual enquiry and evaluation ’ of those ties in the light of the new 2014 @entity57			0
an @entity175 terrorist training camp in @entity176 , pictured in 2001 in the court ’s written judgment , the judge described how @entity8 was involved in continuing clashes with the law after the @entity137 allowed his initial appeal against deportation in july 2009			1
but the judge said the @entity54 was correct to point out that he had not engaged in any terrorist activity since his release from prison in 2008 , and there was no evidence that he was likely to in the future ‘ whether in the @entity75 or in @entity2 ’			0
in august 2009 he was warned for contacting a co-defendant to the terrorist charges , with non-contact being a condition of being freed from prison on licence			0
the judge said he was recalled to prison in december 2009 at the same time as being arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods , although that charge was not pursued			0
in january 2010 he was released on licence			0
in october 2011 he was given a caution for a ‘ road rage ’ incident			0
then in june 2012 he was arrested on a charge in connection with motor insurance fraud , subsequently pleaded guilty and given a 12 - month community supervision order and a 12 - month driving ban .			0
