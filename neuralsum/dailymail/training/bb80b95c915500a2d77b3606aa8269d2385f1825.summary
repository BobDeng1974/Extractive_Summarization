by @entity0 last updated at 8:39 am on 2nd december 2011 homes built before 1919 have risen in value more than any other type of property over the past 25 years , a report reveals today			1
the study , by the @entity6 , said the oldest homes in the country were clearly the best			2
the report says pre- 1919 homes are popular because there are fewer of them , and they tend to be in the best locations			2
a solid investment : a row of edwardian houses , which are often larger than other types of property over the past quarter of a century , the report reveals , homes falling into this category have risen in price by more than 450 per cent			1
this is equivalent to an average increase of more than £ 500 every month for 25 years , a price rise which has not been matched by any other type of property			2
in 1986 , pre- 1919 homes had an average value of £ 33,619 , making the category the cheapest of the four ‘ ages ’ of property			0
by 2001 , the average had increased to £ 117,990 and today it is £ 188,473 , an increase of 461 per cent , or £ 516 every month			0
the other three ‘ ages ’ of property are 1919 to 1945 , 1946 to 1960 and 1960 onwards			0
@entity38 , housing economist at the @entity6 , said it was easy to see why pre- 1919 properties were now more expensive than any other			1
he said : ‘ the age of a property often determines its size , its style and location			1
properties from the @entity48 or edwardian era tend to be in higher demand			1
‘ this is because there are fewer of them			0
they are often larger , situated in desirable locations , and have a popular style			1
’ in demand : @entity48 properties also fared well			1
the age of a property often determines its size , style and location , the survey revealed the cheapest properties are homes built between the end of the @entity65 , which triggered a building boom , and 1960			1
they cost an average of £ 144,988 , and have risen in value by only 249 per cent over the past 25 years			0
as the study highlights the popularity of older properties , it raises concerns about the government ’s moves to encourage people to buy new - build homes			2
the prime minister has said he wanted ‘ everyone in this country ’ to experience the ‘ magic moment ’ of getting the keys to their first flat			0
but the @entity76 scheme , which allows people to buy with only a five per cent deposit , is available only to those who want a newly - built home			0
and it is this type of property which has plunged in value over recent years amid fears of further falls			0
since the credit crunch began , the @entity6 figures show , homes built after 1960 have dropped by nearly £ 40,000 in value			0
@entity97 , a leading independent housing expert , said : ‘ if a man in a hard hat offers you a subsidised mortgage on a nice new house or flat that he has built , just say no. ask for 15 per cent off instead			2

edwardian and @entity48 properties are more ' in demand '
age of house determines its size , style and location , survey reveals
