@entity0 once christened himself ' the cooking woman 's crumpet ' and only last year boasted about how younger women throw themselves at him			1
these days , the @entity5 presenter is almost as well known for his relationship history as he is for his long - running slot on the cookery show			2
today , the 50 - year - old star announced that he is engaged to marry for a fourth time - to his girlfriend @entity10 , 29			2
the couple have been together since march 2013			2
it is the fourth marriage for @entity0 , who has openly spoken of his longing to find the woman he can settle down with forever the couple have declared themselves completely in love and friends of the stars say that he has never been happier			1
so has the greengrocer from @entity23 finally found the woman he can settle down with ? the pair will certainly be hoping that romantic history wo n't be repeating itself			2
after five decades , he has notched up three marriages , several very public declarations of love and thousands of column inches of mud - slinging from exes			2
more recently , he has got a bit of a reputation as a man with an eye for women several years his junior , with whom he indulges in very public @entity40 flirtations			2
but while that was not always his preference , @entity0 has always managed to make waves with his relationship style			1
he married his first wife @entity45 in 1991 , aged just 24 , while he was an up - and - coming greengrocer doing business in @entity49 's @entity48			2
@entity0 made his name on @entity5 , which he has been presenting alongside @entity51 since 2005 the couple got hitched in a 20 - minute ceremony and celebrated with a meal in a pie and mash shop around the corner			1
the marriage lasted just six weeks			1
in his autobiography , @entity58 , @entity0 joked that the union was , ' possibly the shortest marriage in the world , ' and admitted that he knew it was a mistake even before they said ' i do '			1
two years later in 1993 , he met his second wife @entity66 , who worked as a pastry chef in @entity68 in @entity48 , and they had a whirlwind romance that resulted in their birth of their son @entity73 in 1994			0

@entity66 was so affected by the break - up that she was hospitalised for three months and @entity0 was granted full custody of their two children			1
she later said of the break - up : ' i was a nervous wreck			2
' @entity66 pulled no punches in 2009 , when she gave a warts - and - all account of her marriage to the tv star in the now - defunct @entity94			2
@entity0 married his second wife @entity66 in 1999 , the couple had two children together @entity0 had previously claimed that @entity66 turned a blind eye to his philandering , so long as he was home before the children woke up in the morning			1
but in the interview , @entity66 claimed that @entity0 even told her he had slept with a prostitute while they were together and that he used to collect spanking magazines , which he stored in fruit boxes at the back of their garage			1

' if you met him , you ’d think he was a really nice guy			0
he ’s very charming and personable			0
but the real @entity0 is horrible			1

she tweeted the tv star , asking if he knew that he had been called a ' weird crush ' in a magazine			0
he replied : ' ever visit @entity49 ? give me a call , i 'll buy you lunch			0
' a few weeks later , her took her as his date to the @entity138			2
just a few months into the romance , @entity125 quit her job as @entity141 at a school near @entity143 and moved into the @entity145 home that @entity0 shared with his two children			1

but just 14 months later , in march 2012 , the couple announced that they were divorcing			1

he told the @entity170 at the time : ' i ’m gutted with what ’s happened , but we ’re very different people			0
‘ i want to be out on the town			0
' i want to take my sexy , elegant wife to smart restaurants dressed up in her heels on my arm			0
' she likes the local @entity181			0
' despite the split , @entity125 stayed on for a while at their @entity117 home to look after @entity0 's children , while he moved into a two - bedroom flat in @entity49			1
it was just three months later , while he was still getting over his marriage to @entity125 , that @entity0 met glamour model @entity190			1
