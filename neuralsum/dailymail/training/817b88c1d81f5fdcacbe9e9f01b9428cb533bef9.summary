notes : when police raided @entity12 and @entity58 's family home they found bundles of cash totalling £ 330,000 hidden in a cupboard as well as documents relating to dozens of individuals they had unlawfully helped evidence : the couple helped more than 160 clients illegally gain a visa by providing them with false documents alleging they were highly - skilled migrants , charging between £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 each time in its advertising , @entity71 touted itself as ' a leading immigration and @entity74 ' which had ' assisted hundreds of individuals ' enter or remain in @entity6			1
during an - 18 month period between 2008 and 2010 , the couple helped more than 160 clients illegally gain a visa by providing them with false documents alleging they were highly - skilled migrants			1
it is estimated they charged between £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 each time			0
but in reality , the individuals were already in @entity6 as foreign students , or migrant workers employed as low - skilled labour at supermarkets , betting shops or petrol stations , who would not have qualified for a new visa under the current immigration criteria			2
in a bid to bypass @entity2 rules , the couple were using up to 70 sham companies to provide clients with payslips and wage payments which gave the appearance they were earning much larger sums , making them eligible to remain			0

' the court heard that following their arrest in may 2010 by investigators from the @entity129 , the couple sold their home in @entity131 , @entity23 , and transferred £ 466,000 out of the country , before fleeing to @entity42 on fraudulent passports			2

in total , the jury were told mr @entity20 helped 166 people gain visas illegally over an 18 - month period			1
but the real number of migrants who gained a visa unlawfully is likely to have run into the hundreds , with investigators dealing with the case estimating the criminal proceeds from the scam could have netted the pair up to £ 1.2million			1
fifteen clients who benefitted from the scam have already been convicted and sentenced to between eight and 10 months in prison			2
of these , 14 have already been deported			0
