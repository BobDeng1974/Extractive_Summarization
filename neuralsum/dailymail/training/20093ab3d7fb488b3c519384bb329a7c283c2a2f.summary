by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 29 august 2013 from wasps buzzing around your jam sandwiches to an unscheduled interaction with a crab , a day at the beach comes with more hazards than most of us would like			0
but at least you no longer have to put up with a gritty , sandy picnic blanket thanks to a company that uses military technology to keep the annoying grains at bay			2
the sand - free rug , Â£ 34.99 , was created by @entity17 company , @entity16 , and uses special technology to keep pesky grit and other spillages away			2
is this the end of sandy sarnies ? out - @entity23 claims their rug will repel sand thanks to its special weave multiple uses : the technology has been used by @entity29 for everything from mats to beach bags despite the impressive name , @entity34 technology is based on something very simple			1
a unique type of woven mesh , the technology makes it impossible for sand or other grit to accumulate on top of the mat or rug			1
instead , grains of sand fall through specially designed holes , where they are rendered unable to come back up			0
although @entity50 originated in the @entity52 military , it is now used by armed forces across the world - including the @entity55 's			1
originally developed for use by the @entity52 military , the key to the rug 's success is in the multi-weave which means sand ' sifts ' through and back to the ground			1
the technology behind the rug was originally used by helicopter crews who used it to make moveable heli - mats			1
@entity69 made using @entity16 were intended to prevent dust and dirt thrown up by whirring blades - better known as ' brownout ' - from ending up inside the helicopter where it can cause damage to equipment			2
brownout can also temporarily blind helicopter pilots by obscuring their view			0
as a result , during the conflicts in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , brownout was blamed for three in four accidental helicopter crashes			1
now the technology has found a more down - to - earth application in the shape of camping carpets , ground sheets and even a beach bag			0
according to @entity96 , which sells the @entity34 rugs in the @entity55 , traditional camping equipment leaves you ' vulnerable to dirt , sand and dust kicked into and accumulating in your camping space			2
' it suggests laying out your sand - free rug with a blanket placed over the top to make it more comfortable , although it does warn that a gap between the edge of the sand - free mat and the traditional one is needed to make it work			0
the rug itself , belying its cheerful green and blue tartan design , is made from specially woven water - resistant pvc , which , says the company , also means spillages and mess are also kept at bay			0
while the resulting combination will be a bit heavier than other picnic blankets , many will think it well worth it for sand - free sarnies .			0

the rug includes @entity34 technology developed by the @entity52 military
it *filters* dirt through a special weave so it does *n't* accumulate on top
the technology was originally intended to tackle ' brownout '
brownout is thought to be *responsible* for scores of helicopter crashes
