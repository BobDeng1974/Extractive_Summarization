@entity0 was today accused on live tv of being out of ‘ touch with reality ’ after underestimating his family 's weekly food shopping bill			1
the @entity8 leader , who has attacked the government over the cost of living , claimed he spent around £ 70 or £ 80 a week on groceries			1
but he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £ 100 , as he claimed his £ 140,000 salary meant he was ‘ relatively comfortably off ’			1
but he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family of four			1
asked about the average weekly household grocery bill , mr @entity0 responded : ‘ it depends on how much you are spending			2
’ pressed on his own family 's bill , mr @entity0 said : ‘ we probably spend £ 70 , £ 80 a week on groceries at least , probably more than that			1
‘ the point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what i am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people			2
’ but tv presenter @entity47 took him to task for appearing out of touch			1
she told him : ‘ the average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £ 100			1
so you are going to be spending significantly more than £ 70 or £ 80			1
‘ people will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality			2
’ @entity20 presenter @entity47 suggested mr @entity0 's answer showed he was ' not in touch with reality ' inflation rose for the first time in 10 months in april , stalling hopes for a pick - up in real terms wages			1
the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) measure of inflation ticked up to 1.8 per cent after hitting a four - year low of 1.6 per cent the month before , the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) said			2
latest figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent meaning a hoped - for sustained period of pay rising faster than the cost of living has yet to materialise			0
today 's widely - expected inflation figure still means it has been at or below the @entity79 's 2 per cent target for five months in succession - with the rate expected to remain low for some time			2
but it ends a period over which @entity70 fell for six straight months			0
mr @entity0 earns £ 139,000 as leader of the opposition , and his wife @entity86 is reported to earn £ 200,000 - a - year as a lawyer			2
the couple live in a £ 2million family home in north @entity90 with their sons @entity91 and @entity94			1
but mr @entity0 insisted he understood how people were struggling : ‘ sure , lots of people are facing real struggles and i ’m relatively comfortably off but what l know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled and we ’re determined to tackle them			0
’ he went on to admit that he does not face a cost of living crisis himself			0
‘ i do n’t but i can deal with it and i can tackle it and i am determined we do and i recognise it as i go around the country and i see the difficulties people are facing and that is what i hear and that ’s what i am determined to tackle			0
’ mr @entity0 later admitted that his shopping estimate may have been on the low side , saying he had been thinking of the bill for ' basic groceries '			0
speaking on @entity122 , the @entity8 leader said : ' well , i said this morning it was on the basic groceries , the basic fruit and vegetables , about £ 70 or £ 80 - the total shopping bill was slightly higher than that , obviously			1
' on the basics , i was saying it was about £ 70 or £ 80 but the overall shopping bill would obviously be higher			1
' a @entity134 source said : ' it ’s the same old economic incompetence from the @entity8 that gave @entity136 the biggest peacetime deficit in history			0
' they have no long - term plan to fix the economy and @entity0 ca n’t even get the numbers right for his political gimmicks			0
' the blunder is a fresh setback for @entity8 ’s cost of living campaign , particularly on the sofa of an @entity20 show aimed at mothers			0
@entity8 was ridiculed for this advert attacking a vat rise which included fruit and vegetables which are not covered by vat mr @entity0 has repeatedly attacked the government for its policies , which he claims have left people worse off			0
but the party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a vat rise to 20 per cent had added £ 450 to the average bill			2
it featured pictures of fruit and vegetables which are not covered by @entity154 , raising doubts about who signed it off for public release			0
shadow chancellor @entity171 , who is in charge of the party ’s economic policy , distanced himself from the advert			0
‘ look , these campaigns are busy times and there ’s always lots of things going on … ’ mr @entity171 said .			0
