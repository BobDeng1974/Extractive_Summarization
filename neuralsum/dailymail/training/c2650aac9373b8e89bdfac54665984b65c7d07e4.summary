a brain scan revealed a tumour the size of a walnut , surrounded by a cyst the size of an orange			1

‘ you could say her bad singing saved her life , ’ her grandmother @entity35 , 57 , said today			2
@entity5 was diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma - a type of brain tumour which releases fluids , creating a cyst around it			1
she underwent a three - hour operation to remove the benign tumour at @entity47 in @entity29 in august last year			1

@entity21 , who is the nine - year - old ’s guardian , said : ‘ @entity5 used to have a beautiful voice when she was little but gradually it got worse and worse			1
‘ we just thought she was tone deaf but when she started walking in wobbly lines we knew something must be wrong			0
