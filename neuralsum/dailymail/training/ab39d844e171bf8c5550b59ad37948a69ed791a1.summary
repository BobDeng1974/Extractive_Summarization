by @entity0 it is the airline that is famed for hitting passengers with a huge fee if they forget to print their own boarding pass			1
but now @entity5 is going high - tech. the budget airline has launched an app that will allow passengers to store their boarding pass on their phone and avoid having to print it out at all			1
@entity5 has long talked about its wish to get rid of check - in desks altogether and to that end has charged passengers who go to the airport without their boarding pass already printed			1
charm offensive : the new technology is part of @entity5 's attempts to improve its service , along with allocated seating and increased cabin baggage allowance now , passengers can download their boarding pass on to their phone and show the digital version at check - in , rather than printing out a paper copy			1
the boarding passes will be available offline and more than one can be carried on a single phone			2
the app , which was officially launched today but has been available since friday , is currently being offered in @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 and the company said further language versions would follow			1
it also allows passengers to view live flight information , make flight bookings , choose their seats , and add baggage to their booking			0
passengers must check in online up to one week - but no less than four hours - before their flight			2
the only snag ? you have to be in possession of a smartphone			0
if not , you will have to print your boarding pass at home or face a € 15 ( £ 12 ) fee at the airport			1
and , if your phone runs out of battery before you reach the airport , you will still have to pay the € 15 fee to have your boarding pass printed out at check - in			1
plus , 10 per cent of airports that @entity5 flies to do not offer mobile check - in services			1
the company said that these airports would be listed on its website			0
the new app means passengers with smartphones no longer have to print their boarding pass - but they have to make sure their phone does n't run out of battery before they reach the airport @entity5 ’s chief marketing officer @entity70 , said : ‘ we ’ve worked hard to develop a product which we ’re proud of and which will make travelling with @entity5 even better and our customers can expect regular app updates that will make it an even more useful travel tool			1
‘ @entity77 ’ programme has delivered better services , more choice and enhanced inflight and digital experiences for our customers and we look forward to making further improvements for the 84m people who will fly with us this year			0
’ the latest technology is part of @entity5 ’s attempts to improve its image after issuing its first profit warning in over a decade last year			0
it introduced allocated seating , increased its cabin baggage allowance and cut the fee for printing a boarding pass , which used to cost € 60 ( £ 48 )			2
not foolproof : anyone whose phone dies before they reach the airport will have to pay a 15 euro ( £ 12 ) fee to print their boarding pass at the airport last month , in a desperate attempt to appeal to family travellers , @entity5 announced its new family product , @entity106 , offering families a range of discounts on travel and an improved service on all flights			1
with the new plans , families are offered fifty per cent allocated seating discounts on children ’s seats , fifty per cent off checked - in bags for children and discounted priority boarding			2
they also announced fifty per cent off travel insurance for children , reduced infant fees ( now £ 20 ) , a free 5kg infant bag allowance			0
appealing to their passengers travelling with very young children , @entity5 bosses announced that there will now be bottle warming and baby changing facilities on board every plane ( something most parents expect )			2
families will also be allowed two free pieces of infant equipment , such as buggies , booster seats , car seats or travel cots in the hold			0
as an extra added bonus , regular fliers will get a @entity146 bonus – giving them twenty per cent off their third family flight when their family fly twice			0
@entity149 ? in 2012 , @entity5 's chief executive @entity150 called a passenger who was charged £ 236 to print five boarding passes ' stupid ' and an ' idiot ' in 2012 , the airline ’s chief executive @entity154 called a passenger who forgot to print her boarding pass an ‘ idiot ’			1
he claimed that 99.98 per cent of @entity5 passengers printed their boarding pass in advance and said : ‘ to those who do n’t , who say quite politely : ‘ b * * * * * off '			1
' passenger @entity165 was charged € 300 ( £ 236 ) to print out five boarding passes before a flight from @entity168 to @entity169			1
the @entity5 boss branded her ' stupid ' and an ' idiot ' for failing to comply with the agreement at the time of booking			0
mrs @entity165 , 35 , from @entity175 , @entity176 , criticised @entity5 ’s rule and said she was unable to print her family ’s passes while they were in @entity33 for 15 days last month			2
passengers could not print out boarding passes more than 14 days in advance			0
she was backed by more than 350,000 @entity184 users after complaining of her ‘ unfair ’ treatment by the @entity187 no - frills airline , which has been frequently criticised for its extra charges			0
but mr @entity154 said she should have printed the passes at an internet cafe or asked a friend to print and fax them to her			0
instead , he said , ‘ she then comes home and gets on @entity195 , @entity193 help us all , and somehow we are going to change our policies			0
no , we ’re not ’ .			0

free app was officially launched today but has been available since friday
allows passengers to download boarding pass on to their smartphone
boarding pass is available offline and digital version can be used at check - in
if phone battery dies , you *'ll* be charged € 15 to print boarding pass
