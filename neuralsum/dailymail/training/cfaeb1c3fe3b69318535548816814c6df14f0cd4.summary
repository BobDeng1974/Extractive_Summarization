tv food experts have clashed over new £ 200million @entity2 red tape rules which force restaurants to provide details of any dishes containing one or more of 14 different allergens			1
from saturday , restaurants will be required to identify which of their dishes contain the allergens , which range from gluten to soya , milk , mustard , sesame , lupin and sulphur dioxide			1
@entity19 has described the changes as a bureaucratic nightmare , while the former chairman of the @entity23 , the @entity24 , says the rules are ridiculously complicated			1
new rules forcing restaurants to provide details of dishes containing one or more allergens from a list of 14 will be introduced on saturday			1
it is thought the regime will create a punishing bill of £ 200million for industry however , the tv chef @entity35 supports the new regime and claims that any chefs who complain are guilty of laziness			1
the industry estimates the new rules have created a punishing bill of £ 200million for restaurants and the catering industry in order to help the tiny minority of people who have an allergy			1
just two per cent of the nation are believed to have a diagnosed food allergy , according to research by the @entity50 , which equates to around two million people			1
restaurants , cafes , fast food outlets and caterers providing meals in schools , hospitals , prisons and offices have had to check all their ingredients , train staff and create manuals spelling out which dishes contain which allergens			1
the @entity66 said the changes have created enormous upheaval , particularly for small restaurants and cafes			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the challenge will be greatest for restaurants who frequently change recipe or menu items ; pop ­ up or event caterers ; establishments with high staff turnover ; and smaller establishments who may struggle with the resources to track , identify and record all allergens used from main dishes through to garnishes and drinks			1
tv chef 's have clashed over new rules including @entity19 ( left ) who branded it as a ' bureaucratic nightmare ' while @entity35 supports the new regime and claims that any chefs who complain are guilty of laziness ‘ as a result , we calculate that it could cost the industry up to £ 200 million per year to implement new sourcing and management processes , adapt menus and websites and regularly brief and train staff			1
’ @entity19 , the renowned cook and tv food expert , fears the changes will create red tape and make it very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘ dish of the day ’			1
she said : ‘ my worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market			0
soya , eggs , milk and peanuts are among the list of 14 allergens that must be identified under new rules ‘ fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has , but for proper cooks - a nightmare			1
’ but , mr @entity35 said : ‘ i do n’t agree			2
i really ca n’t see how it will kill innovation , how can that happen ? ‘ we change our menus every season			0
you can still create what you wish and be a chef as long as you tell customers what ingredients you are using			0
‘ there is laziness in this industry and it is about time we stopped that			2
we as chefs have to become more responsible for what we are feeding our customers			0
’ mr @entity35 said his own wife has an allergy to gluten , while family members have suffered reactions to dishes served in restaurants			1
he is consultant executive chef for the chain of @entity156 restaurants , which has spent months going through recipes to identify any use of the allergens			1
the chain has re-trained its chefs and created files for each dish on the menu , which can be consulted by waiting staff if a customer has a question about the use of the allergens			2
mr @entity35 said the process has involved a great deal of time and expense , however he insisted the changes are necessary to protect the health of customers			2
the former chairman of the @entity23 , @entity24 , who is 7th @entity24 and runs @entity176 in @entity177 , said the new allergen rules are well intentioned			0
but , he complained : ‘ it is typical of the heavy - handedness of the @entity2 to bring in something like this			0
it is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with			0
‘ you have to audit every menu item , but also , if you buy in sauces , for example , you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them , which is difficult and complicated			0
’ @entity24 , 7th @entity24 and restaurateur , said new rules are ' ridiculously complicated ' the new rules will also apply to products sold in supermarkets where the allergens will have to be identified in bold type on the nutrition labels			2
in a separate move stores will be required to offer clearer information on the origin of fresh meat			0
details on where pigs , sheep and poultry are reared and slaughtered for raw meat sale will have to be on the label			0
the @entity50 says the new allergen rules will provide a lifeline to the estimated two million people in this country who suffer from allergies			1
tree nuts ( such as walnut , hazelnut , almond etc. ) 8			0
sulphur dioxide its research found that seven in 10 of those with allergies avoid buying takeaways , due to fears about allergen			1
more than half of those with allergies – 53 per cent - said they avoided eating in restaurants for the same reason			0
restaurants and cafes have been given flexibility on how they provide allergy information			0
this can be communicated verbally through explanations by staff or signposted to where or how more information can be found on menus or in leaflets			0
allergy expert at the @entity50 @entity257 , said : ‘ with a steady rise in the number of people suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the last decade , these new measures will make it simpler for those with allergies to buy and consume food			2
allergies can be fatal for some people and this is why it is vital that food businesses give their customers information they can trust			2
‘ the legislation is a huge step forward for those with allergies , who should now feel confident they have a right to ask about allergenic ingredients in the foods they buy			0
this normalises allergen information as something that should be available at all times			0

restaurants will be required to identify dishes which contain the allergens
