by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:49 am on 28th june 2011 the @entity2 have vowed to avenge the death of @entity4 by targeting 10 places in @entity6 , the @entity7 and @entity8 the @entity2 has issued a chilling threat to carry out a series of attacks against 10 targets in @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity8 to avenge the death of @entity13 leader @entity4			1
' soon you will see attacks against @entity6 and @entity16 countries , and our first priorities in @entity20 will be @entity8 and @entity7 , ' deputy @entity22 @entity2 leader @entity21 said in a videotape aired on @entity24 over the weekend			1
the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) , or @entity25 of @entity22 , which swears allegiance to @entity28 @entity2 leader @entity27 , is blamed for many of the suicide bombings across the country and remains highly dangerous despite a series of army offensives against its strongholds in the north - west of the country , on the @entity28 border			2
it has not demonstrated an ability to stage sophisticated attacks in the @entity40 , however , and the @entity2 's one apparent bid to inflict carnage in the @entity6 failed			1
the group claimed responsibility for the botched car bomb attack in @entity47 's @entity46 last year			0
but @entity6 intelligence agencies take it seriously			2
it was later added to the country 's list of foreign terrorist organisations			2
the video showed @entity21 , described as more sober and experienced than other @entity2 leaders , flanked by armed followers walking through rough mountain terrain			2
he sits on a blanket beside a sniper 's rifle on a hilltop and explains the @entity2 's plans			0
he said : ' we selected 10 targets to avenge the death of @entity4			0
' deputy @entity22 @entity2 leader @entity21 made the threats in a video which aired over the weekend attack : labourers clean the @entity72 which was stormed by the armed @entity2 militants in @entity74 , a town of volatile @entity76 province , @entity22 @entity21 , also seen firing a machine gun into the distance in the video , did not elaborate			1
but he said the first revenge operation was the @entity2 siege of a @entity22 naval base in @entity83 last month - one of several setbacks the military has suffered since @entity6 special forces killed @entity4 on @entity22 soil on may 2			1
the @entity2 regards the @entity22 army as a @entity6 puppet and it has kept the government on the defensive since @entity4 's death , staging suicide bombings , large - scale attacks on security forces with large numbers of fighters , and employing new tactics			1
a @entity2 militant and his wife carried out a weekend shooting and suicide bombing on a police station that killed 12 policemen			0
@entity7 confirmed yesterday that it is withdrawing 18 military trainers , who had been working with an @entity107 unit in @entity22 , amid ‘ security concerns ’			0
it was unclear whether the move is linked to the latest threat			0
the @entity6 has been leaning hard on @entity22 to crack down on militancy since it was discovered that @entity4 may have been living in the country for years			0
more @entity22 cooperation is needed as @entity115 seeks to wind down their war effiorts in @entity28 and defeat @entity13 , and its allies			0
but @entity22 's generals are furious because the @entity6 kept them in the dark over the @entity4 raid the @entity22 and @entity28 @entity2 move easily across the porous frontier and provide each other with shelter and intelligence , complicating efforts to root out militancy in the region @entity6 president @entity129 has described as ' the most dangerous place in the world ' .			1
