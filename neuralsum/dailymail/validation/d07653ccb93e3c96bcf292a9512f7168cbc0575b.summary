@entity0 have been heavily criticised by former @entity2 star @entity1 , as the playmaker adds fuel to fire ahead of the crucial clash in the race for the @entity8 places			1
the @entity10 international is very much a favourite at his former employers and was keen to play up @entity2 's chances of pipping @entity0 to fourth			1
@entity1 gave a scathing review on @entity16 's side and has described their position in the @entity8 places as a ' miracle			1
' @entity1 labelled @entity0 as ' clueless ' and thinks it 's a ' miracle ' where they are in the table he told the @entity25 : ' i 've seen a lot of @entity0 's matches this season and i find it quite amazing they are in the top four			1
the best way of describing them is clueless			0
' i look at @entity0 and see weaknesses			0
if we move the ball at pace and put them under pressure from the start then we will cause them a lot of problems			0
' considering the talent they have available , they just have n't performed			0
@entity16 and @entity48 wo n't be pleased with @entity1 's comments ahead of the clash ' but having an excellent keeper and not conceding many goals has enabled them to paper over the cracks and win games narrowly			1
' the fact they are fourth is a minor miracle			0
their performances just have n't merited a top - four place			0
' they are n't in the best four teams in the @entity65 and @entity2 are in much better shape			2
' @entity2 are the in - form team in the @entity65 with the @entity8 places in their sights			2

former @entity2 star @entity1 labelled @entity0 as ' clueless '
@entity1 thinks his old side will pip @entity16 's side to fourth
