by @entity0 forward - thinking engineers in @entity2 are the first in the country to have built a section of an enormous overpass and rotate it into place upon completion so as not to disturb the railways below			1
a 17,000 ton part of an elevated motorway was today slowly swung into place in @entity13 after being constructed independently beside a high speed railway track			1
engineers took 90minutes to carefully swing the 17,000 - ton structure into place today above a high speed railway track in @entity13 , central @entity2 a china railway high - speed train passes beneath the rotating sector of the bridge today as engineers expertly swivel it into place it was the first time the technique had been used in @entity2 , with engineers unable to temporarily halt the busy train service in order to build the bridge in place experts took 90 minutes to connect the section to the rest of the bridge , tuning it 106 degrees on a 15metre high axis			1
it was the first time the innovative technique had been used in @entity2			0
the country has the world 's longest high speed rail network with over 6,200 miles of routes in service in december 2012			1
the track beneath the bridge in @entity13 was considered too important to be temporarily halted in order for engineers ' to complete construction			2
once finished , the overpass will be 256m long and span 11 railways , including the 1,428 mile - long @entity51 - @entity50 service			0
experts estimate the bridge will be open to traffic later this month			0
the 17,000 structure is slowly brought into place in by engineers after weeks of construction the unusual technique has been used in the @entity60 in the past , though never before in @entity2 the 17,000 - ton structure was rotated at 106 degrees on a 15metre axis the sector is connected to the rest of the bridge after 90minutes			2
officials estimate it will be open to traffic later this month a similar technique was used to construct the @entity71 i listed @entity73 across the @entity74 in @entity75 in 1968			0
designed in 1963 by sir @entity78 , the bridge 's two halves were built on the river 's bank and swung together at 90 degrees .			0

engineers took 90 minutes to swivel the structure into place in @entity13 today
the section was built *separately* so as not to disturb the busy high speed railway track beneath it
it was the first time the unusual construction technique was used in the country
@entity2 is home to the *largest* high speed rail network in the world
