while i feel there are plenty of modern bowlers who would be just as at home chucking darts at the @entity6 as performing at @entity7 , i do feel @entity8 is a victim of a haphazard and slightly unfair system			1
i ’d rather see anyone with a suspect action being put on notice and monitored in match situations instead of being sent to the laboratory			1
tell them they ’re being watched and get them to bowl in short - sleeved shirts so the umpires can see exactly what they need to			0
if umpires continue to report any bowler , then they clearly have a case			0
a victim ? @entity27 's @entity8 has been reported but is not the only bowler with a suspect action i am thrilled by the response of many @entity32 batsmen to the opportunities in international cricket this season and it will be fascinating to see who the new panel of selectors go for when they name their first test team			1
there ’s one name i have n’t seen mentioned much but which really should be in the frame			0
@entity44 is the best i ’ve seen this season			2
he ’s solid , unflappable and confident and if i were @entity32 i would get this yorkie in			2
you know what they say about a strong @entity50 ? if you do n’t , they ’ll soon tell you			0
@entity44 spirit : @entity50 opener @entity44 should be talked about for @entity32			1

@entity56 the victim of unfair and haphazard system
suspected bowlers should be monitored in match *conditions*
@entity50 opening batsman @entity44 should be in @entity32 contention
