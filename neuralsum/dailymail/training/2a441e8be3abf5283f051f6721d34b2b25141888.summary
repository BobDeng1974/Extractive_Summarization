by @entity0 @entity2 immigration will damage the living standards of everyone in the country as minor economic benefits are outweighed by the social pressures of a relentlessly rising population , one of @entity11 ’s most eminent left - wing economists declared yesterday			1
professor @entity12 , @entity12 at @entity13 and a longstanding adviser to @entity16 departments , said the economic advantages of immigration are ‘ unlikely to be very large ’			1
but the downside – from building on the green belt to the overcrowding of cities – means that the consequences of large - scale immigration ‘ are mostly negative for the existing population of the @entity11 and their descendants ’			2
over the past decade , widely - publicised studies by academics and liberal think tanks have repeatedly said that immigration will make us better off			1
among those reported by the @entity45 have been claims by the @entity48 - leaning @entity47 that immigrants are paying a disproportionate share of the nation ’s taxes , and that they bring economic benefits because they do jobs that @entity11 will not take			1
last november the @entity45 reported a study by two senior academics at @entity57 as saying immigrants who have arrived since 2000 have made a ‘ substantial ’ addition to public finances			0
however , since @entity61 introduced an effectively open - door immigration policy after the 1997 election the @entity64 has been reporting on the impact of migration on population ; on the social make - up of cities ; on unemployment , worklessness , and declining wages for low - skilled workers ; and on the pressure it has brought on housing and services			1
all have contributed to a growing unease about immigration among voters that has led all political parties to pay lip service to curbs on immigration and state benefits for migrants			0
professor @entity12 , a former consultant to the @entity87 and the @entity88 , said in his report that there may be no economic gains from immigration at all			1
if there are , they will be outweighed by extra costs imposed by the strain on housing , land , schools , hospitals , water supplies and transport			0
he said in a landmark report for the @entity104 think tank : ‘ unrestrained population growth would eventually have a negative impact on the standard of living through its environmental effects such as overcrowding , congestion and loss of amenity			1
left - winger : the author of the report , @entity117 , is a former @entity118 and an emeritus professor at the @entity13 ‘ such losses would ultimately outweigh the small gain in average wages apparently resulting from mass immigration			1
’ professor @entity12 said the major economic benefit that immigration can provide is increasing the number of younger people in the population , so that there are more working - age people to support the growing numbers of the elderly who rely on pensions and need more health and social care			1
but he found that the difference to the ‘ dependency ratio ’ made by mass immigration is tiny compared to the major increases in population needed to sustain it			0
‘ if many of the immigrants fail to get jobs , or if they end up in low skill jobs or displace native workers , large - scale immigration will have a negative impact on gdp per capita and on government finances , ’ he added			0
‘ the impact could be positive or negative but either way it is unlikely to be very large			0
the only thing that is certain is that immigration on the present scale , if it continues , will lead to much faster population growth and a much larger total gdp than would otherwise be the case , with consequent pressure on infrastructure and the environment			0
’ professor @entity12 , 74 , is a former @entity118 and remains a significant figure in left - wing economic thinking			1
his report said that net migration from @entity167 countries remains at around 130,000 a year			2
numbers of @entity169 coming to @entity11 should fall , because of economic growth in @entity169 , but ‘ prospects for south @entity172 and poorer eastern states , such as @entity174 and @entity31 , are less rosy			0
’ difficulties : border police are seen moving on @entity31 who had bedded down in @entity32 , central @entity33 @entity180 ’s promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands , the levels of the 1990s , will be ‘ virtually impossible to achieve ’ because of @entity167 immigration , the report found			2
it said that net migration remains at more than 200,000 a year , close to the highest level considered by the @entity185 in its population projections , 225,000			0
this level means the population of the @entity11 will go up by 20million over the next 50 years and 29million over the next 75 years , professor @entity12 said			2
the report said that immigration from outside @entity172 has had ‘ a perceptible impact on the level of native employment ’ since the beginning of the recession , and the same is probably true of immigration from @entity172			0
‘ unskilled workers have suffered some reduction in their wages due to competition from immigrants , ’ the report said			0
‘ even on optimistic assumptions , the economic and fiscal gains for existing inhabitants and their descendants from large - scale immigration are small in comparison to its impact on population growth ’			2

minor economic benefits of migration are ' outweighed by social pressures '
professor @entity117 gave the stark *warning* in think - tank report
the *verdict* pushes against *pro-migration* studies published in recent years
