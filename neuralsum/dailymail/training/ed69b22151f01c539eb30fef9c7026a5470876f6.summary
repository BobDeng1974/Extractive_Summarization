big businesses are to be offered money to turn off their power to stop @entity3 suffering from a winter of electricity power cuts			0
ahead of unveiling a raft of new measures designed to keep the lights , energy secretary @entity6 insisted : ' there will be no blackouts			1
' it follows warnings that the number of power cuts has soared in recent years , amid fears that @entity18 - style rationing will be needed to ensure supplies can be maintained			0
energy secretary @entity6 insisted the government had plans to keep the lights on this winter the government is expected to announce new contingency measures this week to ensure supplies are secure , and options for reducing demand if it is needed			1
it follows concerns about energy security after a fire forced the closure of @entity33 , a gas - fired station in @entity35 which produces enough electricity to meet the needs of one million households			0
it was reduced to half capacity after a blaze broke out in one of the two cooling tower modules at the site			0
the @entity46 incident is the latest blaze to hit @entity3 's power capacity , with @entity49 and @entity50 crippled by fires earlier this year			0
energy supply has also been hit by plans to close a site at @entity55 in east @entity56			2
figures from energy regulator show there were 17,657 blackouts affecting 3.5million people in 2013 - 14 , compared with 1,600 cuts affecting 180,900 in 2010 - 11			0
under the governments plans , mothballed power plants could be brought back into use to bolster power supplies			2
but factories and heavy industry could be asked to reduce or halt production , or switch to their own generators , to ensure homes are unaffected by power shortages			1
mr @entity6 told the @entity74 : ' there will be no blackouts			1
' we have extra contingencies on top of the caution , and extra contingencies on top of the contingencies			1
' they ( companies ) volunteer to get payments - if the @entity89 say , ' we want you to come off the national grid for a few hours and generate your own power ' , you will get paid for that			1
' that is cheaper for the consumer than building an extra power plant			2
cheaper , quicker and industry likes it			0
' a major fire broke out this week at @entity33 , a gas - fired station in @entity35 which produces enough electricity to meet the needs of one million households the blazein one of the two cooling tower modules meant the plant is reduced to half capacity mr @entity6 added : ' some companies would change their behaviour , voluntarily , and be recompensed for it			1
turning down their refrigerators by a degree , or changing a shift pattern for a week so staff come in earlier ... the idea is to move factory production away from peak demand periods			2
' four @entity3 nuclear power reactors which have been shut down after a defect was discovered at one of them will only be operating at three - quarters capacity when they return to service by the end of this year			0
the @entity3 is facing an energy crunch over the next two winters when the capacity margin - how much its total generating capacity outstrips expected peak demand - is expected to shrink to as little as 2 per cent			0
mr @entity6 added that while the public should be energy efficient , turning off unused appliances and lights where they can , the government was not making a formal request .			1

government to set out plans to keep the lights on in the coming months
companies will be paid to reduce demand or switch to their own generators
@entity6 insists he has ' extra contingencies on top of the contingencies '
