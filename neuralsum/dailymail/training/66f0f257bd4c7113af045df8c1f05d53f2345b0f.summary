@entity1 training and testing could inadvertently kill hundreds of whales and dolphins and injure thousands over the next five years , mostly as a result of detonating explosives underwater			1
the @entity1 said that the studies focused on waters off the @entity9 , the @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 from 2014 through 2019 , the main areas that the service branch tests equipment and trains sailors			1
the studies were done ahead of the @entity1 applying to the @entity17 for permits for its activities			2
the @entity1 said that it if had n't done so and was later found to have harmed marine mammals , it would be found in violation of federal environmental law and have to stop its training and testing			2
sorry : the @entity1 studied how underwater explosives and other sailor training will affect sea mammals and found that hundreds will die and thousands will be seriously hurt and there 's nothing they can do about it most of the deaths would come from explosives , though some might come from testing sonar or animals being hit by ships			2
rear adm. @entity39 , the @entity1 's energy and environmental readiness division director , told reporters this week the @entity1 uses simulators where possible but sailors must test and train in real - life conditions			0
‘ without this realistic testing and training , our sailors ca n't develop or maintain the critical skills they need or ensure the new technologies can be operated effectively , ’ @entity39 said in a conference call with reporters on wednesday			0
according to the reports , computer models show it may kill 186 whales and dolphins off the @entity9 and 155 off @entity12 and @entity11			1
practice shots : the study determined that most dolphin and whale deaths will result from explosions from practice torpedoes and missiles over the next five years the @entity1 said it developed the estimates by totaling the hours it will test and practice with sonar , torpedoes , missiles , explosives and other equipment over five years			1
experts then combine the data with what 's known about the marine mammals and then use computer modeling			0
off the @entity9 , there could be 11,267 serious injuries and 1.89 million minor injuries like temporary hearing loss			2
the reports said the testing and training might also cause marine mammals to change their behavior – such as swimming in a different direction – in 20 million instances			0
off @entity12 and @entity11 , the reports said that the naval activities may cause 2,039 serious injuries , 1.86 million temporary injuries and 7.7 million instances of behavioral change			1
but @entity94 , senior policy analyst at the @entity95 , said the @entity1 was underestimating the effect its activities on marine mammals			0
injuries : the @entity1 study also found that their activities will likely seriously injure around 11,000 animals and cause nearly 2 million less severe injuries for example , he pointed to a study by government and private sector scientists published just last month in the journal @entity110 showing mid-frequency active sonar can disrupt blue whale feeding			1
the study says feeding disruptions and the movement of whales away from their prey could significantly affect the health of individual whales and the overall health of baleen whale populations			0
@entity94 said the @entity1 's ocean activities are ‘ simply not sustainable			0
’ ‘ these smaller disruptions short of death are themselves accumulating into something like death for species and death for populations , ’ @entity94 said			0
one of the statements covers @entity12 and @entity11 , while the other covers the @entity9 and @entity10 .			1

the @entity9 , @entity12 , @entity11 , and @entity135 will all see hundreds of whale and dolphin deaths
the @entity1 also expects about 11,000 serious injuries to the creatures , as determined by a study submitted to the @entity17
