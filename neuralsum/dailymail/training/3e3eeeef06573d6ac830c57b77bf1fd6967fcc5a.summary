by @entity0 as the height of summer approaches , doctors are warning people about the risks of skin cancer , urging them to get any unusual looking moles checked out by doctors			1
but the process of investigating these lesions can be a long - winded and , in some cases , complicated process			2
a @entity13 professor is hoping to drastically cut the time it takes to identify cancerous cells using a smartphone app and attachment - and he even claims it is more accurate than doctors			1
the @entity22 app works with a dermoscope attachment , pictured			1
the lens scans unusual looking lesions before highlighting potentially cancerous cells			1
during tests , the app was accurate in 85 % of cases based on visual characteristics - higher than the 50 % to 70 % average accuracy rate of family doctors there is an app already on the market that claims to spot potentially cancerous moles and lesions			1
doctor @entity37 ' uses augmented reality to check moles for irregularities in size , shape , colour and border			0
after taking a picture of a mole , the user is presented with a colour - coded ' risk ' level for each of these characteristics			2
the app can archive and compare data to check for any changes in a mole			0
it will also remind the user when it 's time to check a mole again			0
but the @entity37 app should not be used as an alternative to seeing a doctor			0
the app , called @entity22 , is now being evaluated at the @entity64 @entity63			1
if successful , it could make quick and inexpensive screening a reality for millions of people who lack access to medical specialists			0
@entity70 , professor of engineering technology at @entity13 , has worked on the project since 2005			0
the goal is to provide quick screening in rural areas or in the developing world , where specialty medical care generally is n't available , he said			0
early testing found the device to be accurate 85 per cent of the time , based on visual characteristics			1
this is slightly lower than the 90 per cent accuracy rate for dermatologists , but more accurate than family doctors , who have an accuracy average of between 50 and 70 per cent , according to official @entity88 industry figures			1
the app is now being evaluated for further testing at the @entity64 @entity63			2
if successful , it could make quick and inexpensive screening a reality for millions of people who lack access to medical specialists , claimed the researchers			0
stock image of melanoma is pictured a separate app called @entity37 , pictured , uses augmented reality to check moles for irregularities in size , shape , colour and border once launched , patients would be referred for follow - up if the lesions spotted on the app were suspected to be cancerous			1
in addition to a mobile phone , the technology uses a dermoscope attachment - a special magnifying lens that costs about $ 500 ( £ 294 ) and provides special illumination of the area being photographed			1
before the app becomes widely available , @entity70 said he wants to make sure it is as accurate as possible			2
he is also looking into other diagnostic uses for the technology , such as testing the device ’s ability to screen @entity124 , a flesh - eating bacterial disease , in @entity125			2
dr. @entity126 , assistant professor of dermatology at @entity63 , said the project is in the early stages but looks promising			0
‘ our research with dr. @entity70 on his promising @entity133 app will focus on evaluating its use for risk assessment and as a screening tool for early detection of melanomas , ’ she said			0
‘ we are in early stages of planning and approval for this project , but such an application , if validated , has the potential for widespread use to ultimately improve patient care			0

the @entity22 app works with a high - quality dermoscope attachment
this magnifying lens illuminates and scans unusual looking lesions
it uses industry *guidelines* to highlight potentially cancerous cells
at - risk patients would then be referred to a dermatologist
during tests , the app was accurate in 85 % of cases based on visual characteristics - higher than the 50 % to 70 % of family doctors
it is now being evaluated for further testing before being *released*
