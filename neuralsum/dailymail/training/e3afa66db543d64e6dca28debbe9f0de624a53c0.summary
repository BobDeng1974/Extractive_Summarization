a woman who lost part of her left leg in the @entity3 fears she will not be able to afford her prosthetic limbs after the charity set up to help victims announced it was winding down			1
@entity7 was caught in the explosion when two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in april 2013 , killing three and injuring more than 260			1
but while the 40 - year - old said she was incredibly grateful to the one fund @entity13 charity which has helped her afford four different prosthetic legs , she fears for the future after the charity announced it will stop its operations			1
she currently has four prosthetic limbs , but she expects her health insurance to cover one new one , every three to five years ' i ca n't thank the donors enough for all of their support and generosity , ' she said , but the defence company worker added that she knows the costly appendages will require regular upkeep and replacement for the rest of her life			1
with the help of @entity22 helped she has been able to afford four different prosthetic legs - one for daily use , a waterproof one , a running leg and another for wearing high heels			1
but while people rarely notice her current range of prosthetic limbs , even if she 's out in sandals , she expects her health insurance to cover one new leg , which can run from $ 20,000 to $ 100,000 , every three to five years			1
it 's also likely that it wo n't cover her specialized running , swimming or high heel legs			0
it also appears unlikely that it will pay for other costs such as adjusting the fit of the prosthesis as her stump atrophies and changes over time			0
@entity66 , from who now works part - time , said she hopes she 'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she 's been given , a plan that includes the construction of her own home in @entity29 , @entity30			1
since its foundation shortly after the bombing , the charity has distributed nearly $ 80 million in donations to victims and their families			1
more than 200,000 individuals , corporations and charities in over 60 countries donated to the fund , according to its executive director @entity87			0
this allowed them to give gave around $ 2.3 million to each of the families that lost a relative when the two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in april 2013			2
the one fund has distributed $ 80 million in donations to victims and their families			2
any money remaining after paying the fund 's administrative costs will go to the @entity101 , which will provide care for brain injury victims and others with mental health issues @entity66 fears for other victims like @entity107 who did not qualify for additional one @entity96 money because her amputation came so late			1
but she said she hopes she 'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she 's been given those like @entity66 who lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries received anywhere from $ 421,000 to $ 3.3 million , depending on the extent of their wounds			1
others who were hospitalized but suffered less serious injuries received between $ 150,000 and about $ 1 million , while victims treated as outpatients and not hospitalized received between $ 12,500 and $ 20,500			0
@entity124 said any remaining money will go towards the fund 's administrative costs and the @entity101			0
launched in september , it will provide victims care for those with a traumatic brain injury , persistent hearing problems and mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety			0
it was jointly founded by the @entity137 and the @entity138			0
however , @entity66 fears for marathon survivors who have not received any money from the fund , but who may well need it in the future ' i can only imagine how other amputees feel who do n't have a one fund , ' she said			1
among those victims is texan @entity107 , who finally had her left leg amputated last month after 17 operations to save it			1
like some other amputees , she did not qualify for additional one @entity96 money because her amputation came so late			0
' it 's a little scary because being a recent amputee i was not entitled to the sums that they received , ' she told the @entity161 , referring to other survivors who lost limbs in the attacks			2
suspect : @entity165 , pictured , will face trial in january after being indicted with numerous charges in relation to the bombings			0
he has pleaded not guilty ' however , i am more than grateful for what i did get and know that everything else will work out , ' @entity107 added			2
while she expects her insurance will cover some of the costs for her prosthesis when it 's ready , she said that she will have to pay the remainder out of her own pocket			0
like @entity66 she said she had not problem with the fund which was conceived by current @entity182 governor @entity181 and then - @entity13 mayor @entity183 in the days after the attack			2
' when it comes to injuries sustained from a bombing , there 's really no way to place a price or payout for a lifetime of treatment , ' she said			0
' @entity96 did as good of a job that they could have done with payouts with not knowing everyone 's path for healing and progression			0
' the prime suspect @entity165 , will face trial in january after being indicted with numerous charges in relation to the bombings			0
he has pleaded not guilty , but faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted			0
his older brother , @entity208 , was killed in a shootout with police days after the two pressure cooker bombs killed three people and injured more than 260 others			2
recovery : @entity7 , pictured with a prosthetic leg , appears at an event for @entity13 victims			1

@entity7 lost part of her left leg when the bombs went off
@entity223 helped her afford four prosthetic limbs
she is incredibly grateful to them for their help
the charity is now closing down and will not take donations after dec. *31*
limbs cost a lot to maintain and need to be changed every few years
@entity66 fears for her future and others who will have to meet the expense
