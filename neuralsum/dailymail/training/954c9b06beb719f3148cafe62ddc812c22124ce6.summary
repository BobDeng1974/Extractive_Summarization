by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 13 july 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 14 july 2012 it could be mistake for an untidy haystack - but this mammoth pile of twigs and leaves was yesterday revealed as being one of the biggest birds ' nests ever seen in @entity9			1
the enormous 10ft wide , 6ft high and 2ft deep nest was discovered in the ceiling of a village church tower after parishioners heard bird song during services			1
tiny jackdaws are thought to have taken up to four years to build the giant structure , which was found in the ceiling of @entity19 , @entity20 , near @entity21 , in @entity22			1
it 's not pretty but it 's home : jackdaws have built one of @entity9 's biggest ever birds nests in the roof of @entity19 , @entity20 , near @entity21 , in @entity22 reverend @entity28 ( pictured ) is concerned the huge bird 's nest could pose a fire risk to the church a church warden who went to investigate discovered that a family of jackdaws had squeezed in through a tiny hole left in the wall in order to build the nest			1
plans are now underway to remove the nest , due to fears about the fire risk it poses			2
reverend @entity28 said : " we first discovered it in the spring			0
jackdaws like to roost and nest in loose colonies above buildings , and are known to block chimneys with their piles of twigs			1
' when we were having evening services , you could hear birds singing in the roof			0
' they have gone in through a very small opening where a grill had broken			0
' the nest will now be removed after it was decided it posed a fire hazard to the centuries - old parish church			1
because of its size , the nest will have to be dragged across the floor of the tower before being dropped 20ft on to the floor below			0
' the only way we can get it out is take it through the roof and out the tower , ' said @entity75			0
' i am not trying to un-home them but if they brought in a lit cigarette there would be a huge fire because they have basically built a large bonfire - and you do n't know what else they have brought in			0
' parishioner @entity87 , 47 , said he thought the nest looked more like it should house a prehistoric beast than a family of jackdaws			2
he said : ' it looks like something out of @entity94 - like there should be a pterodactyl living in it			0
' it 's absolutely massive , it 's mind - boggling to think that just a few little birds built it up with twigs and other bits of rubbish			2
' @entity19 in @entity20 where the nest was found jackdaws build nests in cavities in trees , cliffs and buildings - and even household chimneys			1
they make nests from hair , wool , rags , bark , soil , dead grass and sticks and they are known for picking up or stealing shiny objects to hoard			0
@entity122 , a spokesperson for the @entity123 , said : ' it really is an amazing nest			0
jackdaws are known for building intricate nests and this is certainly the biggest one i have ever seen in my life			2
' it is very unusual to see them this large			0
' @entity134 , development manager at the @entity135 , added : ' jackdaws build nests on top of nests , they will build to fit wherever they are , but the case at @entity20 certainly sounds exceptional			1
' ' it is believed the biggest jackdaw nest ever seen in @entity9 was 10ft high and built in a bell tower at @entity144 in 1842			1
