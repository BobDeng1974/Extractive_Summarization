@entity1 's green and pleasant lands have been transformed to scorched earth as the country records the driest september since records began in 1910			1
this month is also likely to finish in the top five warmest , with @entity1 mean temperatures significantly above the monthly average and today reaching a summery @entity7 in some areas			1
according to figures released today , this september was even warmer than august across parts of the @entity1			1
the @entity11 of @entity12 was @entity13 above the mean for 1981 - 2010 , making the month - rarely - warmer than august , said weather historian @entity15			2
it was the warmest september since 2006 , and in the last 100 years only three were warmer , two had the same mean temperature , while 95 were cooler			1
parts of the @entity20 in @entity21 have completely dried up due to lack of rainfall , leaving a rocky scar across the arid countryside			2
and @entity25 , in @entity26 , is running at just 50 per cent of its normal level , reduced to little more than a trickle of its former glory			0
according to @entity32 figures some areas of the @entity1 have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of september , just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall for the month			1
but forecasters warn ' change is afoot ' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of october , although it is likely to remain warmer than normal			1
according to @entity32 figures some areas of the @entity1 have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of september although it looks like the sheep are grazing on meadows , it is actually the @entity25 bed			1
the reservoir in @entity26 is extremely low , around 50 per cent of its normal level the reservoir as it usually appears , surrounded by greenery and with lakes of water			2
but forecasters warn ' change is afoot ' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of october it will start to feel cooler with the mercury dropping to single figures in the north and low double figures elsewhere overnight on wednesday , they say			1
@entity32 spokeswoman @entity75 said an area of low pressure moving over the @entity1 will trigger a change in the weather from thursday			1
she said : ' we have got a change in the weather coming up , until now we have had high pressure bringing settled conditions but low pressure is about to dominate towards the weekend			0
' it is going to start on thursday with gales and heavy rain in the northwest and @entity92 , then on friday and saturday it will move southwards bringing more unsettled conditions			0
' temperatures will also move closer to normal for the time of year and it seems the unsettled weather will continue through much of october			2
' september follows on from the 8th wettest august on record and the wettest winter on record at the start of the year which saw large swathes of @entity104 under floodwater			2
using figures from september 1 - 28 , the @entity1 as a whole has received 19.4mm of rain , just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall which would be expected for the month			1
before this one , the driest september on record was 1959 with 23.8mm			0
@entity26 has only had 58 per cent average rainfall from january to the end of september , making it the driest first ten months of the year since 1929 @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity92 are likely to have their second driest september on record , with 13.5mm , 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively looking at individual countries , @entity120 should break the record for september dryness with only 6.5mm of rain , just 7 per cent of the average			1
the previous record was set in 1986 , with 9.7mm			0
@entity115 , @entity116 and @entity92 are likely to have their second driest september on record , with 13.5mm , 11.9mm and 33.3mm of rain respectively			0
records were set in 1959 ( 7.9mm ) , 1959 ( 11.7mm ) and 1972 ( 31.7mm ) respectively			0
this september follows on from the eighth wettest august on record and comes in a generally very wet year - this january to august is the wettest such period in the records , mainly as a result of the very wet start to the year and the wettest winter on record			2
this means water levels remain sufficient			0
@entity140 , @entity141 deputy director of water resources , said : ' following the wettest january to august on record , water resources in @entity115 are around normal for the time of year			2
' we also look ahead by modelling how rivers and groundwater may respond to different future rainfall patterns			0
the results show a broadly positive picture and even if rainfall is below average this autumn the country will not go into drought			1
' a bridge spans across the @entity20 in @entity21 where stretches of the river have dried up leaving a rocky scar in the @entity159 , following the driest september on record it means walkers can now simply cross the river bed on foot in @entity21 which has been reduced to little more than a road of mud and rocks the mean temperature for the @entity1 so far has been @entity169 , which is @entity13 above the long - term average			1
this means it has been the joint fourth warmest september in the records back to 1910 , but is well below the record of @entity175 set in 2006			0
sunshine amounts have been closer to average , with 94 per cent of what would normally be expected across the @entity1			1
the dry and warm conditions have been caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month			0
this tends to block more unsettled weather heading in off the @entity183 , leaving the @entity1 fine , dry and fairly sunny			2
@entity184 , forecaster for @entity185 , said parts of the @entity1 could see more than 50mm ( 2 inches ) of rain fall on friday night			1
he said : ' a big pattern change as much wetter weather is on its way to the @entity1			1

elsewhere today , people made the most of the hot weather during lunch time in @entity197 , @entity198 , as temperatures remain high for the end of september sunbathers soak up the last of the rays in @entity197 , @entity198			0
the dry and warm conditions have been caused by high pressure dominating the weather for much of the month the heat looked to be too much for some , as one sunbather shades himself with a hat as he sleeps in @entity197 , @entity198 ' the weather will feel very autumnal by the weekend and next week as low pressure takes control of our weather			2
' an active cold front will edge southwards on friday and saturday , and is likely to bring some high rainfall totals to @entity92 , @entity120 , northwest @entity115 and northwest @entity116			0
' 25 to more than 50mm is possible on friday night to early saturday with the highest totals @entity218 and southern @entity92			0
' the weather then becoming a lot cooler by the weekend and very unsettled next week with more widespread rain			0
' latest forecasts suggest the @entity1 will receive 150 - 200 per cent of normal precipitation next week , and often windy too			1
' a coot swims across a pond covered in algae in @entity228 today			0
algae has been far more widespread this year in many ponds and canals because of higher than average temperatures and low rainfall leading to less oxygenated water a couple feed squirrels in @entity228			0
the country is set for the driest september since records began in 1910 , with extremely low rainfall for many parts of the country , the @entity32 has reported @entity228 was bathed in balmy conditions throughout today			1
the @entity32 's three - month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during october , november and december @entity245 , forecaster for @entity246 said : ' as we progress throughout this weekend and into next week a major change is set to take place to a more autumnal type weather pattern			1
' low pressure will become a widespread and more dominant feature and this will result in some markedly cooler temperatures across many parts of the country			0
' it will also become rather unsettled and stormy with periods of rain for many parts of the country , which will also be accompanied by some very strong to gale force winds , in particular , in parts of the north			0
' however the good news is there is no sign of a big freeze this winter with generally warmer than normal conditions expected until the end of the year			2
the @entity32 's three - month contingency planner states temperatures are likely to remain above average during october , november and december			1
it states : ' the latest predictions for @entity1 - mean temperature favour above - average temperatures for both october and october - november - december as a whole			0
' overall , the probability that the @entity1 - mean temperature for october - november - december will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 35 pert cent and the probability of falling into the coldest of our five categories is close to 10 per cent			2

according to @entity32 figures some areas of the @entity1 have had less than 20mm of rainfall for the whole of september
the figure is just 20 per cent of the normal amount of rainfall which would be expected for the month
this month 's dry spell means river beds have dried up and some reservoirs low *â€“* but experts say there was enough rain throughout the rest of the year so it is not officially a drought
parts of the country *enjoyed* highs of @entity7 on the last day of the hottest september for more than 100 years
according to figures released today , this september was even warmer than august across parts of the @entity1
but forecasters warn ' change is afoot ' with a much wetter and windier picture for the beginning of october
