@entity58 was the biggest draw of the witnesses heard in court on thursday , as he was brought in from jail to testify against @entity64			1
both legal teams accept that @entity64 was on top of the victim at one point during the attack , but today defense attorneys were focused on trying to determine whether @entity58 clearly saw that @entity64 was raping the girl or miming an action			2
his account : @entity56 previously struck a plea deal and will spend 27 years behind bars after participating in the attack and urinating no the then - 16 - year - old girl testimony : he was brought into court on thursday to talk about his recollections of @entity64 's involvement ' did you see his penis , ' the attorney asked @entity58 at one point			1
the exact wording of @entity58 ' earlier conversations to police came up as a point of contention while detective @entity42 was on the stand earlier in the day			0

mr @entity42 said that they did use similar tactics			0

earlier this week , the court heard from the girl 's father , who received a taunting phone call from his daughter 's cell phone mid-attack where one of the young men talked about how good she was at sexual acts			0

she told the court she has a hazy memory of the attack but remembers getting kicked in the stomach and falling over			0

as many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl ' i remember not seeing anything because my eyes were closed and i was holding onto my necklace and getting kicked in the stomach , ' she said			2
she was repeatedly asked if she remembered drinking alcohol and said no , though the defense said this contradicted what she told police and medical staff after the attack			0
nor does she have any recollection of the sexual assault or consenting to any advances			0
her legs ' felt like somebody had ripped them out of place ' and she felt nauseated , ' as if someone had took out my insides , stabbed them and put them back in ' , she said			0
graphic pictures of her swollen face and bruised body were shown to jurors as she told them that to this day she still has scars on her back - the result of cigarettes being extinguished on her skin			0

the woman received $ 4 million from the @entity190 though a civil claim in the case			0
the victim testified at the beginning of the third week of the trial			2
face off : nearly four years after she was gang raped , the victim of the brutal attack took the witness stand for the first time to recount her memories before she awoke the next day in ' excruciating pain ' horrific : earlier in the trial , the jury was shown pictures of the injuries ' @entity23 ' sustained from the attack , which included cigarettes burned into her back			1
