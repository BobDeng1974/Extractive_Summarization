i feel privileged to be here and ca n't wait to get started '			2
the chairman has taken over after torrid few years that have seen the corporation lambasted for its handling of the @entity24 scandal , and a @entity26 investigation that led to the @entity27 being wrongly accused of child abuse			2
the @entity1 was also heavily criticised over excessive payouts given to senior staff including £ 470,000 to former director - general @entity31 after only 54 days in the job and £ 680,000 to former chief operating officer @entity33			1

she said : ' they are under no illusions about the challenging environment ; the changing viewing patterns , the explosion of choice and the rapid changes in technologies and markets			0
they understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past , while building this compelling future			0
' the former chief executive of the @entity55 also said in her email she would ' defend vigorously the @entity1 's independence while holding it accountable to its audience '			1
she will have to deal with pressure to scrap its traditional funding method - the licence fee - which has been much criticised by politicians , performers and former corporation staff in the run - up to the renewal of its charter , which expires in 2016			2
mrs @entity0 , whose husband @entity68 is a private equity boss and former @entity71 councillor , was also asked about a £ 1.1million severance payment she received last year from @entity73 , the parent company of the @entity55			1
asked whether it would compromise her ability to crack down on excessive payoffs at the @entity1 , she said : ' i would hope not			1
it is clearly a lot of money			0
but i have to say those were relatively standard within my industry for the level of the role that i had and for what i had done			0
it was done entirely within contractual terms			0
' i 'm not going to apologise that i came from the private sector			0
' scandal : the resignation of @entity31 is one of a number of crises the @entity1 has faced in recent years statement : in an email to staff mrs @entity0 said bosses ' understand that they need to operate efficiently and to rectify some of the high profile issues of the past ' in august mastermind was accused of gender bias after it emerged most of its questions last week were about men			1
during the first episode of the latest series , screened in august , host @entity105 asked 81 general knowledge questions to the four contestants			0
of those , only five were about real or fictional women , 38 were about men and the rest were about things			0
the imbalance quickly attracted the ire of some viewers on the @entity1 's own @entity118 , an online forum on which diehard fans air their views			2
one posted : ' was it just tonight or do mastermind questions always overwhelmingly refer to men or things but rarely women ? ' @entity127 has been axed from his role covering @entity129 for @entity130 5 live after he sparked a sexism storm			0
in the summer of 2013 the @entity1 was bombarded with complaints when @entity133 suggested @entity135 player @entity134 - who went on to become women 's champion - was ' not much of a looker '			2
just days after @entity140 claimed the gaffe was due to hayfever , the corporation announced @entity143 would be replacing him on the radio station for this year 's tournament			0
mrs @entity0 has been criticised for owning almost £ 5million worth of shares in @entity73 because the company has a deal to publish @entity1 branded educational books			1
she said she would sell them if she was advised it would be a ' clear conflict of interest ' not to do so			0
defending her £ 110,000 @entity1 salary for a three - day week , she said : ' it 's the salary that i was told had been decided by the government , so it 's a given			1
i know that if i stayed in the private sector a chairman role would attract a much , much larger salary			0
' becoming the @entity1 's first female chairman is a landmark moment			1
in the past the corporation has been accused of ' absurd political correctness ' linked to gender equality , including recently cutting the word ' girl ' from a documentary about the @entity169 , fearing it might cause ' offence '			0
last year veteran journalist @entity172 described the @entity1 as having a ' sexist culture ' for decades where ' when a woman 's age exceeded her bra size she was finished '			1
' those of us who have worked at the corporation over the past three decades know this once - great institution has been open to many forms of corruption – including sexual , ' she told the @entity184			0
' over the years i have often returned to the @entity1 to work on programmes and my observations of the sexist culture have always been the same			1
that some of the often oxbridge - educated powerful male elite behave in a predatory way towards attractive and ambitious women seeking to move up the @entity163 's greasy pole ' .			0
