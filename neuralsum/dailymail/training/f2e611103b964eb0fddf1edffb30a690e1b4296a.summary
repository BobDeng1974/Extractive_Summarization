swiping their claws before pouncing forward , the duo move around their ' dancefloor ' with a sort of hap - hazard grace at the @entity13 , @entity14			1
at one point the pair stand up on their back legs and touch paws - almost as though they 're about to start a ballroom dance			1
strictly cub dancing : two playful lions dance together , swiping their paws and pouncing forward in the @entity13 , @entity14 moves : one of the cubs stands on his back legs while the other watches on slightly cautiously @entity31 routine ? one cub stands while the other reaches up to place its paws on its partners - perhaps getting ready to ballroom dance then one of the dancers takes a run up - much to the apparent alarm of its partner who watches on with a look of dread in his eyes			1
perhaps the pair were attempting to try out a lift , as performed by professional dancers			0
unfortunately there is no photographic evidence as to how it turned out ... later on , however , it would seem that one of the dancing duo has overdone it and so takes a little rest , lying on its back with its legs stretched up in the air			2
meanwhile its partner waits on patiently - eager for its next spin on the dancefloor			0
paw performance : one of the cubs looks terrified as its partner takes a run - up			2
perhaps the duo were about to try out a gymnastic lift taking a break ? clearly exhausted by the arduous routine , one of the cubs takes a little rest while its partner , still eager to continue , waits patiently perfect partners : the images were taken by wildlife photographer @entity75 , 41 , who spent two weeks waiting for the shots of the cubs the beautiful photographs were captured by professional wildlife photographer @entity75 , 41 , from @entity79 , who spent two weeks in @entity80 , @entity14 , waiting for the perfect shots of the cubs			2
mr @entity75 said : ' i was there to photograph the annual wildebeest calving season			0
' the rains were late this year and the wildebeest were still in @entity88 waiting for the rains to arrive			0
' the animals in the area were all quite desperate for the first rains to fall and the daily dust storms would choke the air			0
shall we dance ? meanwhile , two older female lions practise their routine in @entity98 , @entity79 and hold ! one of the dancing queens has a look of concentration on its face during this particularly tricky move ' i took these pictures just as the rain started to fall and almost instantaneously these older lion cubs started to play with each			1
' elsewhere , it would seem that two older lions have also been struck with a bit of boogie fever			0
but rather than a hap - hazard dance routine - these two pros have got their moves down to an art. the pair sway and hold a variety of poses in a far more elegant ensemble than the younger performers			2
the females , pictured at @entity98 , @entity79 , first stand up on their hind legs - a move the cubs could only briefly master			1
then they stand paw - to - paw , looking into each others eyes , and embrace			1
professionals : rather than the cub 's rather less elegant routine , these female lions seem to have dancing down to an art - embracing and swaying together the judges would n't like that ! at one point the pair seem to mess up their dance , with one of the partners slipping from the embrace finally , they sway from side to side in a routine that would give any @entity147 contestant a run for their money			1
however , at one point disaster strikes and one of the females slips			0
the mistake obviously causes a rift between the pair - as one paces away from the dancefloor , with the other following closely behind			2
but the fight does n't last long as the females are soon back together practising another routine			0
diva disaster : perhaps upset by her partner 's sloppy performance , one of the lion paces away from the dancefloor - hotly pursued by its partner kiss and make up : the rift does n't last for long , however , with the partners soon embracing once again			0

two cubs shuffle their paws and *lurch* forward on their ' dancefloor ' in the @entity13 , @entity14
pair stand on their hind legs and dance paw - to - paw as if they 're about to ballroom dance
meanwhile , two older females practise their moves at the @entity186 , @entity79
dancing queens also stand on their back legs before embracing , touching paws and swaying together
