by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:33 est , 15 february 2014 a high court judge has blocked a plan to build a huge wind turbine amid an unspoilt historic landscape , in a ruling that will give hope to campaigners nationwide			1
the 284ft turbine , which would have been visible from more than three miles , was due to stand in an area of @entity13 countryside dotted with historic churches , a @entity17 - listed @entity16 mansion , and a moated 15th century castle			1
although the scheme had been rejected by @entity13 district council , a planning inspector overturned the decision and gave it the go - ahead – even making the extraordinary suggestion that the giant rotor blades could actually draw tourists to the area			1
unspoilt landscape : the turbine would have overlooked historic gems such as @entity32 a high court judge has blocked a plan to build a huge wind turbine at @entity36 in @entity13 although the scheme had been rejected by @entity13 district council , a planning inspector overturned the decision , giving it the green light - even making the extraordinary suggestion that the giant rotor blades could draw tourists to the area but high court judge @entity43 yesterday granted a court order to the council quashing the scheme ’s approval , saying the inspector failed to give adequate weight to the impact on the landscape and historic buildings			1
threat : the landscape was in danger of having a huge turbine , like the one pictured , installed landowner @entity59 had applied for permission to erect the turbine on his farm at @entity62 , one of the highest points in @entity13			1
mr @entity59 , who operates @entity36 under the name @entity65 , argued it would generate energy for 665 homes and be ‘ a good asset to the community ’			2
listed buildings in the magnificent surrounding countryside include the @entity17 - listed @entity74 , which is of @entity16 origin , the 15th century @entity32 , also @entity17 , and four churches listed at @entity77 *			0
the council , which originally unanimously refused planning permission in august 2012 , was outraged when planning inspector @entity80 ruled last april that the huge turbine could be built			1
remarkably , he declared in his decision that the impact of the giant rotor blades in the midst of such beauty ‘ would be less than substantial ’			2
and in response to objections that it would deter tourists , he said : ‘ for some , a wind turbine provokes interest rather than distaste			0
’ the local authority immediately launched a @entity96 appeal and argued that approving the scheme ‘ flies in the face of the will of the local community ’			0
the application had generated 1,800 letters and emails , 1,450 of which had been against the turbine plan			0
council members argued that allowing the turbine could open the door to similar future applications , damaging the district ’s vital tourism industry			0
landowner @entity59 had applied for permission to erect the turbine on his farm at @entity62 , one of the highest points in @entity13			1
he argued it would generate energy for 665 homes and be ' a good asset to the community ' yesterday judge @entity43 ruled that the planning inspector did not comply with the planning regulations requiring him to have special regard to the ‘ desirability of preserving the settings of listed buildings ’			1
but he added that , had the inspector complied with theses , he could still have come to the same overall decision			0
last night @entity13 district council leader @entity130 welcomed the ruling , saying : ‘ while a firm supporter of the economic benefits of off - shore wind energy , the council firmly believes on - shore wind turbines detract from the unique landscape of this beautiful area			2
’ member of the no to that turbine protest group councillor @entity142 said : ‘ the decision by the last inspector was disgusting because it did not take into account the views of local people			2
‘ a turbine would ruin the view for miles around			0
the tourism industry is vital for north @entity13 as it employs 8,500 people and brings in £ 400million a year			0
’ mr @entity59 , who is building a 20 - acre solar farm next to the proposed turbine site , said : ‘ we will carry on fighting to get the turbine			2
the benefits would far outweigh any impacts			0

landowner @entity59 applied for permission to erect the turbine at his farm at @entity62 , one of the highest points in @entity13
@entity13 rejected the plans
but a planning inspector overturned the council *'s* decision
but a high court judge said the inspector failed to give enough weight to the impact the turbine would have on the landscape and historic buildings
