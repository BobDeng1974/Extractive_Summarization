by @entity0 @entity1 died from a heart attack after taking ecstasy at a rave a man accused of selling a lethal dose of ecstasy was cleared today after saying he could not have been the cycling dealer because he looked ‘ stupid ’ on a bike			1
@entity10 , 21 , was acquitted of supplying @entity11 to 16 - year - old @entity1 , who suffered three heart attacks after he overdosed on half a gram diluted in water in january this year			1
the teenager died three days after an illegal rave in @entity16 , south @entity17 , having assured his mother , ‘ i love you , @entity20			2
i promise i wo n’t die , ’ before he left			0
mr @entity10 had been accused of acting as a ‘ mule ’ for dealer @entity23 , meeting @entity1 and four friends behind warehouses in @entity16 , south @entity17			1
but while @entity23 pleaded guilty to supplying the killer substance , the case against mr @entity10 was based on a single teenager ’s ‘ weak ’ identification of the supposed culprit , based on their twenty - second encounter			1
the jury was shown footage of the identity parade and had asked to see the films for a second time just minutes before returning their not guilty verdicts			0
the video shows an officer asking the teen witness - who can not be named - if he has made a positive identification based on the mugshot of mr @entity10			1
the teen , supported by his mother , faintly replies , ‘ yes ’ , but had apparently failed to understand the question			0
he then asks , ‘ do i have to be certain ? if i have to be certain , then no. ’ but he signed a form confirming @entity10 was indeed the suspect			1
giving evidence , mr @entity10 said he could not have dropped off the drugs by bike since he had not ridden one since he was ‘ 16 or 17 ’			1
‘ i think i look stupid on a bike , i ’m pretty lanky , ’ he told jurors			0
a mountain bike belonged to his best friend but was usually unchained outside @entity10 ’s house and could be used by anyone , jurors heard			2
four days later he was arrested at a party in his neighbour ’s home			2
‘ i never dealt any drugs to anybody ’ , he maintained			0
today a jury of seven men and five women cleared mr @entity10 of being concerned in the supply of @entity70 drugs on 17 january this year			1
prosecutor @entity71 had admitted the line - up identification was ‘ weak ’ , although the boy later told the court in person he was ‘ 80 percent sure ’ he had got it right			0
the heard how @entity1 and his friends had clubbed together £ 80 to spend on the party - drug to take at an illegal rave at a former cotton factory in @entity81			1
@entity1 fell unconscious after consuming @entity11 at the event which was attended by 3,000 revellers			1
the court heard @entity1 took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was ' talking a lot more than he usually does ' , including talking about his girlfriend he had sprinkled around half a gramme of the crystalline powder into 500ml of water and drunk it all at once after he was admitted inside the warehouse			1
shortly afterwards @entity1 took his shirt off , became animated about his girlfriend and started to dance			2
by 4am his temperature had soared and he collapsed unconscious on the floor			0
he was rushed to @entity98 hospital by paramedics but nothing could be done to save him			0
the teenager who was a pupil at @entity102 in south @entity17 , died at @entity103 three days later after being admitted to the specialist liver unit for emergency surgery			0
a toxicology report showed traces of @entity11 in his blood			2
the bright sixth - form student had dreamed of joining the army or becoming an @entity112 teacher before the lethal deal was struck with a dealer named ‘ @entity115 ’ - whose real name is @entity23			0
mr @entity10 , @entity118 , @entity119 , was cleared of being concerned in the supply of @entity70 drugs on 17 january			1
he was further found not guilty of being concerned in the supply of @entity70 drugs between 1 january 3013 and 16 january 2014 and being concerned in the supply of @entity124 drugs over the same period			1
earlier this week @entity23 , of @entity125 , @entity16 , admitted being concerned in the supply of a @entity70 drug , being concerned with the supply of cannabis and simple possession of cannabis			2
@entity23 will be sentenced on 1 august			0
@entity10 , 21 , from @entity118 , @entity17 , was charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class a - @entity11 to @entity1 ( pictured ) but has been cleared by a jury later @entity1 ’s parents , @entity135 and @entity136 said in a statement : ‘ @entity1 was an incredible boy and an incredible son , who we loved with all our hearts , who made a very bad decision on 17 january			1
‘ over the course of the next three days in january , we had to watch him slowly die as the drug had caused everything inside him to stop functioning			2
‘ we would willingly have given our lives in place of his if we could , and when @entity1 died part of us also died			1
‘ as a family with a massive gaping hole now in our centre , we ’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our ‘ new normal ’ will be , but we ’ve barely begun and have a very long and very hard road ahead of us			0
’ the family went on to appeal to those responsible not to ‘ waste the rest of their lives continuing to sell drugs to schoolchildren , and playing their part in the damage , destruction and death of other people ’s children ’			0
‘ we believe very strongly that @entity166 is safe with @entity167 and that we will bring him once again and this does bring hope , ’ the family added			0
‘ but the despair remains in having to walk through each day of the rest of our lives without him , because of this one bad decision			0
‘ the people who supplied the drugs have choices remaining to them , and the rest of their lives in which to make them , and we will continue to pray that they choose to use them for good			0
