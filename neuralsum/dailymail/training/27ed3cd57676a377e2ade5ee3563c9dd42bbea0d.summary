in november of 2012 , nearly 50 years after @entity2 tossed his message in a bottle into the ocean , the bottle was found			1
but not on some exotic , tropical island as @entity2 might have hoped - it was found a quarter of a mile away from where @entity2 had thrown it in			1
the bottle was found by @entity21 about a week after @entity22 devastated the @entity10 coast - he was picking through some debris outside his sister 's home when he saw the jar away from the other bits of rubbish scattered throughout the yard			1
message in a bottle : this note was found in november last year - nearly 50 years after it was tossed into the @entity7 message from the past : @entity22 tossed the message in a bottle into a back yard a quarter of a mile from where it was tossed into the sea science experiment : @entity2 , seen here with his father , would often do these types of ' experiments ' when he was growing up against the odds : the mason jar contained the 12 - year - old 's letter along with a 5 cent piece so that whoever found the letter could write back postage : @entity2 included a 1958 nickel in the bottle so whoever found it could mail him answers to his questions rather than throw it out with the rest of the debris , @entity21 put it on his sister 's deck and got back to work			1
' it looked like it was meant to be found , ' @entity21 , 53 , told the @entity68			0
the note @entity21 recovered was dated saturday august 16 , 1963 , and had the following written on it in all capital letters : ' to whom it may concern , please fill out the following questions and mail			0
' this is a scientific experiment by @entity2 , age 12			2
' the questions written on the note were ' where was the jar found ? when was it found ? how was it found ? and anything else which might help me			0
' included in the jar was @entity2 's address in nearby @entity89 , @entity10 and five cents for whomever found the note to buy a stamp			2
record ? @entity94 's bottle was about 50 years shy of setting a record for the amount of time passed before a message in a bottle was found cleanup : @entity21 points to the spot where he found the jar while cleaning up after @entity22 long journey home : mr @entity21 ( left ) reunites mr @entity2 with his jar along with @entity21 's sister , @entity107 , and @entity9 official @entity108 ( right ) now 61 and living in @entity110 , @entity10 , @entity2 told the paper he 's shocked the bottle was recovered			1
' things happen for a reason			0
i guess it â€™s good it came to shore			0
it shows anything is possible , ' he said			0
he added , ' my father and i used to do stuff like that all the time			0
' @entity2 said he called the @entity125 to find out if his bottle had broken any records			1
unfortunately , the record for a bottle found after being tossed to sea was set in 2012 by a fisherman from the @entity132			2
that bottle spent 97 years and 309 days at sea			0
