lesbians are less likely to suffer mental health problems than bisexual women , new research claims bisexual women are more likely to suffer mental health problems than lesbians , new research claims			1
the largest @entity9 survey of its kind found bisexual women are more likely to feel depressed , self - harm , and develop eating issues			1
bisexual women were 64 per cent more likely to report an eating problem and 37 per cent more likely to have deliberately self - harmed than lesbians , according to the research published in the @entity18			1
they were also 26 per cent more likely to have felt depressed , and 20 per cent more likely to have suffered from anxiety in the previous year than lesbians			0
using data from the 2007 @entity23 , researchers from the @entity21 analysed responses from 5,700 bisexual and lesbian women living in the @entity9 aged 14 or over			2
the study found bisexual women were less likely to be ' out ' to friends , family and work colleagues and also less likely to be in a relationship			1
while they were less likely to experience sexuality - related discrimination from work , healthcare services , education and family than lesbians , they were more likely to suffer problems with friends			0
the new findings differ from those of a similar @entity9 survey in 2003 , which found no difference in psychological distress between bisexual women and lesbians			1
study lead author @entity44 added : ' these disturbing results echo international findings on mental health differences between bisexual and homosexual people			0
' although non-hetrosexual women as a group have far poorer mental health than heterosexual women , bisexual women report even worse mental distress than lesbians			0
' study senior author dr @entity54 , of the @entity21 , said : ' bisexual people are at particular risk of invisibility and marginalisation from both gay and lesbian communities and mainstream society			0
' although bisexual women in our study reported experiencing less sexuality - based discrimination than lesbians , this did not benefit their mental health			1
' mental health services should be aware of both the differences and the similarities in bisexual and lesbian women 's mental health care needs , and tailor the services they provide accordingly			0
' the researchers also found that older bisexual women had more suicidal thoughts than younger bisexual women			1
they were also more likely to report poor physical health and more likely to use marijuana or tranquilisers than lesbians			0
ms @entity44 added : ' all women deserve equal chances of mental well - being and happiness , regardless of their sexuality			0
bisexual women are ' more likely to feel depressed , self - harm , and develop eating issues ' ( file picture ) ' homophobic prejudice is now widely and rightly condemned ; specific stigma around bisexual identity needs to be similarly confronted			1
' in the @entity9 , where the study was conducted , the numbers of women identifying as lesbian and as bisexual are similar			2
however , only 16 per cent of the survey participants were bisexual women			0
the researchers suggested this may be linked to bisexual women 's reluctance to disclose their sexual identity			2
the researchers said that ' concealment of sexual orientation is known to be related to poorer mental health in sexual minority women '			0
the study authors suggest that bisexual women may have a more negative attitude towards themselves , and expect more social rejection , putting their mental health at risk			1
the authors suggest that legal and social changes in subsequent years , such as the 2004 @entity119 , and improvements in public attitudes towards lesbian and gay people , may have benefited lesbian women more than bisexual women .			2

bisexual women are more likely to feel depressed and self - harm
they are also more likely to develop eating issues , @entity9 study found
may be because many of them hide their sexuality , researchers suggest
