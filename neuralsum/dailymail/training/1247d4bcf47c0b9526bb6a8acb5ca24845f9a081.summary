@entity0 is facing an ‘ almost inevitable ’ attack by fanatics who have been ‘ militarised ’ by @entity3 , according to police and security officials			1
in speeches today , @entity6 and senior police will warn that the ‘ diverse ’ terrorist threat posed by jihadis returning from @entity11 and @entity12 is one of the greatest this country has ever faced			1
potential attacks could range from a ‘ lone wolf ’ beheading in a crowded shopping centre or street , to a bomb plot using fertiliser stolen from @entity0 farms			1
one @entity23 official told the @entity24 : ‘ it is almost inevitable that something is going to happen in the next few months			0
@entity0 ’s most senior officer , sir @entity30 , said police and @entity32 have already foiled five major plots this year according to @entity0 ’s most senior officer , sir @entity30 , police and @entity32 have already foiled five major plots this year			1
chillingly , there is normally only one major plot disrupted every 12 months			1
addressing a conference in @entity40 , mrs may will unveil draconian new laws to try to protect the public and stem the flow of cash and recruits to @entity3			2
they include a ban on the payment of any ransoms to terrorists and making it easier to track extremists on the internet			0
internet companies will be forced to keep data which helps to identify the user of an individual mobile phone or computer			0
but the law stops short of making them log every website a person visits after the @entity63 said the so - called ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ was ‘ dead and buried ’			2
the home secretary ’s new anti-terrorism and @entity66 , to be presented to @entity68 tomorrow , also includes powers to : sir @entity30 said the challenges faced by police and @entity32 in monitoring jihadis returning from @entity11 were huge			1
he warned : ‘ they ’re going to be militarised , they will have a complex web of people that they know , and of course they will have learnt tactics that they may want to use here			0
’ speaking on the @entity83 ’s @entity82 , sir @entity30 said there was a ‘ growing concern ’ about the risk of a ‘ lone wolf ’ attack on @entity0 streets			1
soldier @entity90 was murdered by two @entity92 converts who ambushed him as he walked back to his barracks in @entity95 , @entity40 , last year			2
‘ it does n’t take an awful lot of organising , does n’t take too many to conspire together , there ’s no great complexity to it , ’ sir @entity30 said			0
‘ so that means we have got a very short time to interdict , to actually intervene and make sure that these people do n’t get away with it			0
’ today assistant commissioner @entity108 , the @entity109 ’s most senior counter-terrorism officer , will say the ‘ danger posed by violent extremists has evolved ’			2
speaking alongside mrs may at the @entity113 , he will say : ‘ they are no longer a problem solely stemming from countries like @entity12 and @entity117 , far away in the minds of the public			0
‘ now , they are home - grown , in our communities ; radicalised by images and messages they read on social media and prepared to kill for their cause			1
’ he will also reveal how police have offered specific advice to farmers to ensure that fertilisers are stored securely so they can not be stolen by fanatics to make bombs			1
' we will chop off the heads of whoever you bring ' : a @entity0 @entity139 fighter dares west to send ground troops in this video rant a member loyal to the @entity3 ( @entity139 ) waves the terror group 's flag in @entity146 , @entity11 mrs may , who has been fighting a long - running battle with the @entity63 for greater counter-terrorism powers , is equally bleak in her assessment			1
she said : ‘ there was a time when people were looking at perhaps just @entity155 - related threats that were a long time in the planning			1
‘ now the threat is more diverse in terms of the number of groups out there who will be looking to carry out attacks in the @entity163			2
it ’s also more diverse in that not everybody ’s affiliated to a particular group – some are self - starting groups and you do have individuals , perhaps the “ lone wolves ” or the volatile individuals			2
‘ we have to look across the board at all sorts of threats that are out there			2
’ @entity176 ( right ) , who fled the @entity0 for the @entity177 , is believed to have been killed there the plans to make it easier to monitor the public ’s use of the internet revives a long - running controversy which has split the @entity185			1
at the moment , only the so - called @entity187 address is recorded when a person uses the web			0
the ip addresses are not tagged to individuals and can regularly change , even on a home computer which connects to the internet using broadband			0
under new laws , the internet companies must link these ip addresses to the identity of the person using them			0
but , at the insistence of @entity203 , it stops short of mrs may ’s demands for a full ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’ which would make internet companies log details of every website a person visits , along with their use of social media			0
tomorrow , a long - awaited report by @entity215 ’s @entity214 will say @entity32 was in the dark about clues on social media that could have alerted them to the fanatical intentions of the killers of @entity221			0
the report will stop short of saying @entity32 could have prevented the attack on the day .			0
