by @entity0 last updated at 12:22 pm on 2nd november 2011 billions of pounds of investment in @entity3 's mobile phone network seems to have been wasted as one in four people still have very poor or no access to @entity8 services			1
half of the population now owns a smartphone , which rely on faster services for internet and e-mail , but a study by communications watchdog @entity16 has found that vast swathes of the @entity3 lack adequate coverage to make them work properly			1
a new study also reveals only 13 per cent of @entity3 is covered by all the major networks , which means 7.7million @entity3 homes or businesses do not have a choice of all five 3g mobile companies			1
in a matching map , areas with best coverage are shaded green , while those with the worst are red , and the fact that large parts of the @entity3 are scarlet shows the poor services many receive			1
@entity8 coverage by premises : @entity16 has revealed the level of poor service @entity3 mobile users are receiving despite billions in investment			1
@entity39 denotes the best coverage while red shows the worst mobile phone companies like @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and 3 have to provide coverage in 80 per cent of the @entity3 , but it seems that they are concentrating on profitable urban areas and pushing aside rural @entity3			1
' mobile providers tend to prioritise investment in network infrastructure where the maximum number of consumers and businesses can be served , ' an @entity16 spokesman said			2
last year , @entity43 and 3 together invested £ 400million in upgrading their 3g capability , and both spent millions more this year			0
figures show that by 2009 , @entity45 had already spent more than £ 500million on network upgrades - and then announced it would invest ' hundreds of millions of pounds ' more in the coming years increasing speeds and coverage			0
meanwhile , @entity44 has claimed it spends £ 1.5million a day on upgrading its network , which is around £ 500million per year since at least 2008			0
they have also reportedly invested huge sums in developing smartphone technology themselves			0
using data supplied by communications companies , the regulator split the @entity3 into 200 areas and ranked them according to how well they were served			2
struggle : around half of @entity3 now have a smartphone like the @entity76 , pictured , but millions do not have the coverage needed to use it properly the worst - hit areas are mid-wales and the @entity81 of @entity82 while @entity83 comes out best			1
the measurements were taken outside and critics think that the situation indoors could be even worse			0
@entity87 , chairman of the @entity88 , said ' @entity16 quotes figures for outdoor mobile coverage of buildings and @entity3 geography , but what also matters to most mobile users is the coverage that they get when they 're at home or at work			1
' consumers do not want to have to go outside to make and receive calls			0
' although the @entity16 report explains that actual consumer experience will differ from the outdoor figures , in reality consumers indoors will experience much worse coverage			2
' @entity105 would like to see @entity16 and the industry develop a better measure that reflects how and where consumers and small businesses really use their mobile phones			2
' @entity16 is working with the government on how to invest £ 150million to help fill gaps in mobile coverage			2
the findings will now be used as a base against which future performance can be measured			0
@entity16 chief technology officer @entity118 said : ' this is our first report to the government on the @entity3 's communications infrastructure			0
' we hope it will be a useful reference point for interested parties , particularly in the light of the recent government funding package of £ 150 million to help address mobile not - spots			0
' the study , part of the regulator 's first infrastructure report , also found internet traffic in the @entity3 has increased seven-fold in the past five years			0
domestic broadband use now averages at 17 gigabytes per month , enough to download 11 films , stream 12 hours on the @entity136 or listen to 12 days of audio over the net			0
according to @entity16 , ' data from the @entity140 shows that traffic over its network , which connects @entity3 internet service providers , has increased seven-fold in the past five years '			1
mixed : broadband coverage in the @entity3 has improved markedly but some areas still have very poor services			1

@entity16 study finds 7.7m @entity3 homes or businesses do not have a choice of all five 3g mobile companies
the worst - hit areas are mid-wales and the @entity81 of @entity82 while @entity83 comes out best
experts say *results* are for coverage outside so it could be even worse inside homes and offices
study also shows marked increase in quality of broadband coverage
