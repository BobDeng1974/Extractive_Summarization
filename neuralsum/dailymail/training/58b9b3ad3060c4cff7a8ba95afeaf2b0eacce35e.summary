@entity0 and @entity1 shot @entity2 four points clear at the top of @entity5 on wednesday night as they beat @entity6 2 - 1 despite a late goal from @entity9 loanee @entity8			1
@entity11 ’s team took the points at a price with three key players ruled out of saturday ’s @entity2 derby – first @entity16 hobbled off hamstrung , then @entity1 , who had scored the first , went off with a metatarsal injury , and @entity18 was then booked meaning he will be suspended for the next game if @entity2 are unsuccessful with a planned appeal			1
@entity6 also lost a player before the break with keeper @entity23 taken to hospital after clashing with @entity25			2
despite losing their keeper and going 2 - 0 down in the first half @entity6 made it difficult for @entity2 reminding his manager @entity28 and @entity9 coach @entity30 , that he knows where the goal is			1
@entity1 scored the goal of the game as @entity2 beat @entity6 2 - 1 during their @entity5 encounter on wednesday night @entity1 scored a diving header on 12 minutes to put the @entity38 holders in front against @entity6 the @entity41 playmaker wheels away in celebration after scoring a delightful opener for @entity2 during wednesday 's encounter the midfielder ( left ) runs to the corner flag in celebration before being congratulated by team - mate @entity18 the 23 - year - old ( centre ) is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring a brilliant header for the @entity53 outfit @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity54 ; @entity16 ( @entity55 9 ) , @entity56 , @entity18 , @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity1 ( @entity0 27 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 90 ) ; @entity25			1
subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67			0
goals : @entity1 12 , @entity0 booked : @entity56 , @entity18 , @entity61 @entity6 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity23 ( @entity69 35 ) ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ; @entity77 ( @entity78 - 54 ) , @entity79 ( @entity8 67 ) , @entity80 subs not used : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 goals : @entity87 booked : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity73 , @entity76 , @entity78 , @entity80 referee : @entity89 attendance : 65,500 @entity6 started the game brightly with @entity80 denied in a one - on - one with @entity54 inside two minutes			1
@entity16 then overstretched in a challenge and had to hobble off holding his hamstring			0
@entity2 took the lead four minutes later when @entity1 had the time and space to allow a @entity18 cross to bounce in front of him before heading it home			1
it was @entity1 ’s eighth league goal which is more than @entity102 managed in any of his four seasons at @entity2			1
the @entity41 has banished all lingering doubts that @entity2 were wrong to replace one with the other last summer			2
@entity6 were by no means out of the game and when @entity80 slipped a pass through for @entity75 the midfielder might have equalized but instead hit the post			2
with @entity6 ’s next attack he again found space unmarked but this time his shot was saved by @entity54 and @entity113 could n’t reach the rebound			2
having already seen @entity16 go off @entity2 lost @entity1 to a right foot injury that @entity2 will hope is not a metatarsal break			1
@entity0 was the logical change			2
the next man down was @entity6 keeper @entity23 who was flattened by @entity25			0
the @entity120 keeper felt the full force of the @entity123 ’s knee as both went for a @entity126 cross inside the six - yard box			0
for the second game running the @entity6 keeper was unable to finish a game and just as last weekend ; he was replaced by substitute goalkeeper @entity131			2
the first thing @entity133 had to do was pick the ball out of the back of the net			0
@entity113 gave possession away and @entity61 took over spraying it wide right to @entity25 whose intelligent pull - back was intended for @entity0			2
@entity61 almost intercepted it but let it run for the substitute who drilled it past @entity133			0
@entity60 then fed @entity57 and his pull - back was fired just wide by @entity25			0
@entity6 had the chances to be ahead but could easily have found themselves 3 - 0 down			1
it was little wonder they were losing their heads			0
@entity70 was booked for hacking down @entity0 and @entity73 followed him into the book for a foul on @entity60			0
real were dealt a blow before @entity1 's opener though when defender @entity16 ( right ) appeared to pull a hamstring the @entity156 international ( centre ) had to walk off the pitch injured on nine minutes and was replaced by @entity55 @entity56 was then booked for handball as @entity2 did their best to coast to half time			1
@entity60 had been left alone by the boo - boys in the first half and he wowed the crowd inside the @entity53 with a delightful scooped pass that played in @entity58 only for the @entity165 to squander the chance			0
the ridiculous debate about the effectiveness of a player who has won four trophies in less than two seasons scoring in three finals will continue , but most sensible @entity2 fans accept @entity60 ’s enourmous contribution			0
@entity175 kicked , and trod - on , @entity58 just before the break and was lucky to only be booked – the last thing @entity2 needed was a third enforced first half change			1
the second half started with @entity2 looking to finish @entity6 off as soon as possible			1
@entity60 created , but then missed , the first chance cutting in from the right and with @entity25 in space to his left the boo boys had their chance but never took it			0
the extent to which the abuse aimed at @entity60 should not be taken seriously ca n't be underestimated – moments later @entity0 smashed a shot against the frame of the goal from a tight angle with other options on and there was nothing but applause for the local boy			0
bale the serial trophy - winner remains the outsider ; @entity199 had the same problem not so long ago			0
@entity2 doubled their lead on 36 minutes when substitute @entity0 ( left ) finished from close - range against @entity6 the 21 - year - old wheeled away in celebration after scoring @entity2 's second goal of the night on wednesday @entity0 ( centre ) was congratulated by his real team - mates as they took what it seemed a comfortable 2 - 0 lead against @entity6 @entity6 were dealt a blow midway through the first half when goalkeeper @entity23 ( left ) was left stricken after colliding with @entity25 @entity23 ( left ) is looked after by @entity25 but is soon replaced by @entity69 after the head injury @entity60 ( left ) was a constant menace to the @entity6 defence throughout the match at the @entity217 @entity60 was suffering at the hands of the opposition and @entity73 should have seen his second yellow of the night when he up - ended the former @entity222 man			1
@entity2 were now in full flow and @entity25 failed to finish a sweeping move down the left that involved @entity0 and @entity18			1
@entity6 brought on @entity9 loanee @entity226 and with ten minutes left he pulled a goal back for the visitiors			2
@entity6 ’s man of the match @entity80 dribbled along the byline from the left and @entity8 tapped in from inside the six - yard box			1
the striker grabbed the ball from the back of the net and charged back up for the restart			0
@entity2 had been showboating with only @entity80 ’s dive over @entity57 ’s leg , for which he was booked , their only chance			0
the late goal meant @entity11 ’s team had to nervously count down the last few minutes but they held out			0
@entity8 had proved a point , but @entity2 had taken all three			2
@entity8 ( far right ) celebrates his strike for @entity6 as he pulled one back for the visitors on 80 minutes however , the visitors ' hopes were dashed as they failed to find an equaliser on wednesday night			1

@entity1 puts @entity2 ahead against @entity6 at the @entity217 on 12 minutes
first - half substitute @entity0 doubled @entity253 ' *advantage* on 36 minutes
@entity8 scored a late consolation for the visitors from close range on 80 minutes
