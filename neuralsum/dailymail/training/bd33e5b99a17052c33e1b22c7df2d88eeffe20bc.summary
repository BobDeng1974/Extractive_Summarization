voters in just a handful of constituencies could determine whether @entity3 or @entity4 is prime minister after the most unpredictable general election in decades , polls of marginal seats suggest			1
a new analysis of 114 seats surveyed individually by former @entity11 deputy chairman @entity10 suggests there is ‘ no consistent pattern ’ that will allow pollsters to predict the outcome in may with any confidence			1
‘ it is possible that a handful of seats could decide whether @entity21 gives the first shot at forming a government to @entity3 or @entity4			0
the results in the marginals will matter more than ever , ’ the peer said			1
@entity3 's chances of staying in @entity27 after the next election rests on just a handful of constituencies former @entity11 deputy chairman @entity10 said the result of the next election would could down to how a number of marginals ' more than ever ' before his findings , based on constituency polls conducted over the last eight months , have turned up a series of surprising results			1
some northern @entity11 mps appear to have a better prospect of holding on than some of their southern colleagues , despite the assumption that their party is doing worse in the @entity44			1
a number of @entity46 are so far defying the national tide with swings in their favour , while others are headed for defeat			0
some @entity53 and @entity54 seats are vulnerable to @entity55 , even though its vote share was only in single figures in them five years ago			0
@entity53 ’s chances in may ’s election , meanwhile , could be fatally undermined by the surge of the @entity63 in @entity64 , now the subject of more detailed polling commissioned by @entity10			1
‘ the coalition government , the collapse in national support for the third party , the rise of a fourth , and shifting allegiances in @entity64 – combined with the accelerating erosion of tribal loyalties that has continued for three decades or more – have made election predictions a more than usually hazardous business , ’ he said			1
‘ each survey shows the state of play in a given seat at a given point in time : voters who are so inclined will be able to use the snapshot of their constituency to help them decide where to place their cross			2
‘ tactical voters can be better informed than ever before			0
voters in @entity92 , for example , will note that @entity53 look best placed to unseat @entity93 in a constituency that the @entity46 have traditionally – if not , recently , very closely – contested with the conservatives			2
‘ conservatives in both @entity44 and @entity96 will see that although their party came second by less than a thousand votes last time round , @entity55 now appear to offer the best chance of unseating @entity53			2
‘ @entity46 considering @entity53 in @entity99 will know their seat is on a knife edge , and that their switch would make a @entity11 gain more likely			1
‘ @entity53 voters in @entity105 who do not wish @entity106 to represent them in @entity107 will observe , however reluctantly , that to keep him out they will have to vote @entity54			0
’ @entity3 and @entity4 need 326 mps to form a @entity110 majority			0
the @entity54 are currently 23 short			0
@entity53 need another 69 mps to form an overall majority			0
the two parties key target seats are listed above the latest national poll by @entity116 put @entity53 and the @entity118 neck and neck , on 33 per cent each			0
@entity55 is on 13 per cent , the @entity120 on eight and the @entity46 in a miserable fifth position , with seven per cent			0
@entity55 ’s performance is its worst with @entity116 for three months , despite the pollster prompting respondents by naming the party in its options for the first time			1
the @entity130 party ’s standing has been slipping steadily since the summer , according to averages of the main pollsters .			2
