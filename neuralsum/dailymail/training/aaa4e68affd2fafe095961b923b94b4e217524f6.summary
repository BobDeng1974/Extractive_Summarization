i was walking down the corridor of @entity2 , one of the nicest hotels i ’ve ever been in , looking for my room			2
across my arms i had some @entity8 training kit , i was a bit like the @entity10 character @entity10 played by @entity11 in that @entity13 sketch when he stumbles upon the @entity8 squad			1
the important difference was that i was actually in the @entity8 squad			1
the painter and decorator from @entity18 had hit the big time			2
aha , got it ! room 296			2
the temporary abode of @entity8 footballer @entity20			1
i wiggled my key card into the door and turned the handle , but nothing happened			2
so i did it again			2
if i had to go back to reception carrying all this gear because i ca n’t get into my room , they ’d probably throw me out for being too blinking thick			2
i gave it another go and , as i wiggled the card in the slot , i heard someone coming down the corridor — hopefully a member of hotel staff who could get me into my room			0
i could n’t make out who it was from a distance , although they were also carrying gear so it must be another player			0
the figure finally emerged from the shadows of the corridor and my heart skipped a beat when i realised it was @entity24			1
@entity55 ! he was going to think i was a right spanner			0
‘ i ’ve heard about you , ’ said @entity24 as he got close enough for me to hear him			1
‘ i suppose that ’s my room , is it ? ’ ‘ naah , no , no			0
’ i replied , but before i could say any more @entity24 looked up at the door number and down to the envelope for his key card and said : ‘ it is my room ! ’ i looked at my envelope and saw that it said 269 , not 296			1
in training : bullard with former @entity8 boss @entity70 , who called him up to his squad heartbreak : but @entity20 , training here with @entity75 , never got on the pitch to win a @entity8 cap @entity78 it like bullard by @entity20 is published by @entity81 at £ 16.99			1
to make matters worse , i immediately felt guilty for no reason			0
‘ i know you think i was going to do something in there , but i was n’t , honestly , ’ i kind of pleaded			0
@entity24 grinned at me and replied : ‘ go on , hop it you ! ’ i was so embarrassed , completely mortified			1
as i went off towards my room i kept thinking : ‘ he ’s never going to believe that i was n’t trying to pull some kind of prank			0
’ @entity24 and i had a little bit of previous which would certainly have raised his suspicions			1
it all stemmed back to a pre-season trip i ’d been on with @entity99 a couple of years before			0
we were staying in the same plush hotel as @entity102 , who @entity24 was playing for , and we were playing them in a friendly			1
for the entire six days i put everything - a round of golf , some golfing gloves , buggies for a few of the players , i even treated myself to a new @entity113 wedge and lots of drinks - on our gaffer @entity116 ’s room			2
i ’d clocked his room number when we checked in			0
i had n’t been there long but i thought : ‘ this will be a classic			0
’ later , we were all in the bar and so were a few of the @entity102 lads , including @entity24 and @entity124			1
‘ @entity126 lads , what are you all drinking ? ’ i said as i proceeded to order one of the most enormous rounds of drinks in history			0
feeling pleased with myself , i called @entity24 over for a chat , although my team - mates were reluctant as if they were somehow scared of him			1
pinpoint precision : @entity20 was called up on three occasions following his displays for @entity99 magic moment : @entity20 celebrates avoiding relegation with @entity99 team - mate @entity141 in 2008 but they were soon back when i asked about the rumours that he ’d had an affair with the @entity24 ’ former nanny @entity145			1
‘ what ’s happening with @entity147 and all that then ? ’ i said to him			0
‘ come on , open up ! ’ he started to laugh			0
‘ to be honest , she fancied @entity151 , not me ! ’ was his reply			0
we all started to laugh			0
‘ that ’s a great “ @entity155 ” card , that is , @entity24 , ’ i said			1
‘ do n’t give me that , what ’s the true story ? ’ but he told us he was being serious			0
@entity151 and @entity24 : @entity24 and his wife @entity151 scrubbed up fairly well as they arrive at the @entity159 in @entity160 claims : @entity24 's former @entity162 @entity145 says that the two of them had an affair in 2004 @entity78 it like bullard by @entity20 is published by @entity81 at £ 16.99			1

@entity20 and @entity24 were *briefly* @entity8 team - mates in 2008
once *jokingly* *confronted* the former *captain* about @entity145
the former @entity175 *midfielder* was never capped at international level
