they are two of the most glamorous of @entity2 's royals and today was no exception for the @entity5 ' @entity4 and @entity7 's @entity6			1
the two royals were visiting the carbon - neutral @entity10 island , a small speck of land just off @entity7 's @entity13 , and just about managed to hold on to their hats during a blustery ferry ride there			1
thanks to the churning @entity19 waves , the two also suffered a wobbly moment as the ferry , called @entity22 , lurched beneath them			0
joined by @entity36 , 46 , and @entity37 , 47 , the two royals , who are long - standing friends , traded quips as they made the crossing			1
glamorous though the royals looked , they looked even more so during an evening reception celebrating @entity5 culture at the @entity45 in @entity46			1
@entity4 , resplendent in a russet one - shoulder floor - length gown studded with rhinestones , showed no sign of fatigue , instead displaying a gorgeous golden tan			0
the royal kept things informal , however , by wearing her long blonde hair loose and curled while @entity37 was dapper in his dinner jacket			0
stylish : @entity4 is glamorous in russet as she arrives at the @entity45 in @entity46 convivial : @entity37 cracked a joke as he posed with the @entity7 royals outside the venue not to be outdone , crown princess @entity6 was striking in a chic strapless black dress with a flattering empire - line cut			1
in contrast to her @entity5 counterpart , the @entity34 - born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye - catching diamond - shaped gold earrings			2
equally glamorous was @entity7 's @entity70 who donned a rose - pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug			0
the men too looked good , with @entity70 's husband @entity76 natty in a dark blue dinner jacket while their son @entity36 scrubbed up well in a matching number			0
chic : @entity5 @entity37 , @entity7 queen @entity70 , @entity26 and @entity76 glowing : @entity4 traded her usual large jewels for a discreet diamond necklace and matching earrings the cultural celebration topped a busy day in which the two sets of @entity2 royalty experienced the best of @entity7 weather on a sunny but blustery ferry crossing			1

all smiles : the two royal couples appeared to be in good spirits as they arrived on @entity10 island hanging on : at one point , the @entity19 breeze threatened to send both royals ' hats flying as is her wont , @entity4 pulled out all the stops in royal blue , while @entity70 rose to the occasion in a spectacular pale blue dress			0
not to be outdone , crown princess @entity6 looked wonderful in white , while her sister - in - law , @entity125 - born @entity124 , shimmered in lilac			2
on wednesday morning , it was back to business with the two couples travelling to @entity130 to visit a special type of @entity7 boarding school called an efterskole			1

a second programme , this time being made for @entity34 's @entity165 , could also cause some discomfort , thanks to claims that @entity6 had had second thoughts in the run - up to her 2004 wedding			0
by contrast , @entity4 and @entity37 have enjoyed a smooth ride of late , with @entity4 in particular becoming increasingly popular			2
