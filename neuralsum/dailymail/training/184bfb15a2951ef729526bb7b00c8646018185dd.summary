by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 26 march 2013 shopkeeper @entity1 is accused of deliberately trying to short - change a customer so he could keep the winning amount himself a shopkeeper tried to claim an £ 80,000 lottery jackpot by telling the lucky ticket holder he had only won £ 10 , a court heard			1
@entity1 is accused of deliberately trying to short - change @entity8 , who was part of syndicate of 28 , so he could keep the winning amount himself			1
mr. @entity8 said his winning ticket was found screwed up in a ball under the counter at @entity16 ' store after he had been given just £ 10 for it			1
the alleged con came after mr. @entity8 went to @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , and handed over four tickets from the previous saturday 's @entity23 draw			2
each contained seven lines and the first produced a £ 10 win with a corresponding pink receipt - type slip of paper			0
the second ticket produced nothing but when the third was checked it also produced a pink slip			0
mr. @entity8 told @entity34 he asked @entity1 ' what 's that , another tenner ? ' and the 26 year - old shopkeeper allegedly replied ' yes '			1
having been told he had won a total of £ 20 mr @entity8 used the money and a further £ 8 to buy another 28 lines for the next draw			1
the court heard he then left the shop and spent the weekend in @entity44 watching @entity45 beat @entity46 in the @entity48 ' @entity47 last may			0
on his return he checked his numbers on a spreadsheet he used for an additional ' in - house ' bingo game played by his syndicate of 28 work colleagues at @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity21			0
it was then that he realised they had won more than £ 10 and he went back to the store to double - check the ticket which he had given @entity1			2
he mistakenly thought they had successfully picked out five numbers and stood to win £ 1,000 - when in fact they also had the bonus ball and had won £ 79,887			0
the jury heard that @entity1 was there when mr @entity8 arrived and appeared to be ' taken aback ' when he told him about their win			1
@entity1 and other staff agreed to search for his ticket and told mr @entity8 to return a few hours later			1
the court heard that mr. @entity8 then told @entity73 what had happened and gave them the unique number for the store 's lottery terminal			2
having returned to work still without the missing ticket , mr @entity8 checked his numbers again online and discovered the true size of their win			1
the alleged con came after mr. @entity8 went to @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , ( pictured ) and handed over four tickets from the previous saturday 's @entity23 draw ' i just sunk , ' he told the jury			2
' i was gutted because this had gone from £ 10 to £ 1,000 to almost 80 grand			0
' i went and told my boss and he hit the roof and told me to get back down that shop and find that ticket			0
' @entity1 was in the shop when mr. @entity8 went back to look for his ticket - this time with two colleagues			1
he said : ' you can imagine my mood had changed slightly from winning £ 1,000			0
' i said : " i 'm not leaving this shop until i have this ticket in my hand			0
it 's worth £ 80,000 and something is not right here			0
" i was n't messing around , i wanted my ticket			0
' the court heard that staff , including @entity1 , gave mr @entity8 and his pals bin bags to search and after about 15 minutes he was invited to search behind the counter			1
@entity109 platforms were removed from the base of the counter and when one of the shop staff swept underneath with a broom out came a lottery ticket rolled up into a ball			2
@entity116 ( pictured ) heard how @entity1 was arrested after @entity73 carried out an investigation into the incident mr @entity8 added : ' as he opened the ticket i saw the date and grabbed it out of his hand straight away and said : " that 's my ticket			1
" i then recognised the numbers			0
' i was just relieved to have the ticket , ' he said			0
' i was n't suspecting anything			0
' during cross-examination he agreed @entity1 had offered him the winning tickets and corresponding pink slips back when he initially went to the store on may 18			2
' that 's my fault for being too trustworthy of someone i have known for a few years , ' added mr @entity8			1
the court heard @entity73 launched their own investigation , which led to @entity1 ' arrest the following month and the money was paid out to the syndicate			2
the prosecution claim that @entity1 ' deliberately and dishonestly ' misled mr. @entity8 and the only ' logical conclusion ' was that he could claim the winning £ 79,887 himself			1
but the defendant - who denies fraud by false misrepresentation - claims the short - changing was a mistake			1
