by @entity0 it was thought to have built by @entity2 in the 8th century as border between @entity4 and @entity5 but even though it has been part of the @entity9 landscape for centuries , the ancient @entity6 may have to be renamed , after archaeologists discovered it could have been completed 200 years before the great @entity14 leader was born			1
experts used radiocarbon dating on the 177 - mile dyke and revealed it could have been constructed as early as the 4th century			1
ancient : archaeologists have used radiocarbon dating on the dyke , which acted as a barrier between @entity4 and @entity5			1
results revealed it had been constructed at least 200 years earlier than first thought it was installed to protect the @entity27 , which is now known as the @entity28 , from an invasion by @entity5 forces			1
the group behind the project said it is a ' tremendously exciting discovery ' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke			2
the @entity37 excavations were carried out on a stretch of the dyke along the @entity41 border near the town of @entity43			0
@entity44 , director of the @entity37 , said : ' it 's been known as @entity6 for centuries but some sections may not have been built by @entity2			2
' it may be a bit late to change the name now - although it raises some interesting questions			0
' the dyke , an @entity14 earthwork up to 65ft wide in places , was built as a man - made border between @entity4 and @entity5			2
it was built by @entity2 , who came to the throne in 757 after the murder of his cousin @entity60			1
he ruled the area now know as the @entity28 and historians say he was the most powerful @entity14 ruler before @entity63			0
today it is a protected monument and the @entity65 is one of @entity9 's longest walks - stretching rom @entity68 in @entity70 down to @entity71 in the @entity72			1
change : experts believe the 177 - mile @entity74 's @entity6 , which runs from @entity68 in @entity70 to @entity71 , may have to be re-named because of the revelation monarch : a drawing of @entity2 who reigned from ad 757 to 796 and was regarded as the most powerful @entity14 leader before @entity63 the material came from an ancient layer of re-deposited turf underneath the bank suggesting it was laid down as part of the construction process			1
mr @entity44 said : ' this is the first time we have accurate scientific dates for @entity6			0
' certainly the dyke was built to make a statement about the power of the kingdom of @entity27			2
' until now historians believed the dyke was built by @entity2 of @entity27 during his reign between 757 and 796			1
natural beauty : the structure is a protected monument and is now one of @entity9 's longest walks but the section of earthwork near @entity43 have been carbon dated and revealed a 95 per cent probability it was built between 430 and 652			0
mr @entity44 said : ' it is likely that parts of the dyke system was in place before @entity2 's time			2
' but it is also likely that he would have consolidated the existing network into what we now call @entity6			0
' it is now clear that it was not the work of a single ruler but a longer - term project that began at an earlier stage in the development of the kingdom			0
' further work is needed on other parts of this enigmatic monument before we can really say who built it and why			0
' revelations : archaologists said the new date was a ' tremendously exciting discovery ' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke investigation : however , the group said more work needed to be done before any further action was taken			0
