defending : reigning tour of @entity5 champion sir @entity2 will look to retain the title for @entity8 victory : @entity8 rider @entity2 , pictured during last year 's @entity19 , won the title in 2013 ' it 's always been a tough race but the support we receive from the fans is incredible , and it 's our home tour so i 've always enjoyed racing it			1
' earlier this summer it had been unclear if @entity11 would take part as he eyed the @entity38 as a warm - up for the world championship time trial , but once @entity41 confirmed he would race in @entity42 on his return from injury , @entity11 had to change plans			0
however , defending the title in his home race is not a bad alternative			0
' from the start of the year it 's always been a goal of mine to race to the @entity19 , ' he said			0
' the race is growing in stature year on year and it 's our chance to go there with a strong team and race in front of home fans to thank them for their support over the season			0
' glory : @entity11 took the gold leader 's jersey last year after a time trial on stage three of the race and retained it @entity11 will be the favourite to take the crown again , although he could face strong competition from @entity78 's @entity77 @entity76 - a rider who has been strongly linked with a move to @entity8 in time for next season			1
@entity11 will be able to call on plenty of experience from his support team thanks to the inclusion of veterans @entity14 and @entity15 , while @entity12 - who helped @entity41 to @entity88 glory last year - is back in action after a bad crash in the @entity91			0
@entity13 and @entity15 were both part of @entity8 's @entity94 squad this year			2
after the start in @entity10 , the week - long race will head south through @entity97 towards @entity98 for the traditional run over @entity100 in stage five , and then moves east along the south coast before heading into @entity103 for the final stage on september 14			1
