@entity101 missed the @entity242 championship two weeks ago after suffering a concussion during an earlier playoff game , and clearly benefited from the rest			0
he caught the ball at the 13 - yard line and took off , blowing past three would - be tacklers and streaking down the middle of the field for the @entity13 's signature play to this point			2

@entity200 , for all his bluster before the game , went out with a whimper when he injured his ankle early in the fourth quarter			1
he was taken off the field on a cart and returned later on crutches			0
oddly enough , @entity7 's 34 completions were a @entity13 record , but his turnovers did a hole the @entity1 never found a way out of - and it may be the last time he dons a uniform because of recurring neck injuries he will address in the offseason			1
oh , and , about the weather that so many people were concerned with for so many months - temperatures held steady in the mid- 40s and the only thing resembling snow that came close to the field was a shower of confetti at the end .			0
