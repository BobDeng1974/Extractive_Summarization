a university is under fire for building a cage to stop homeless people sleeping on its campus			1
@entity6 put metal grilles around a set of hot air vents in an alleyway to prevent down - and - outs using them to stay warm on cold winter nights			1
the move prompted complaints from students - but the university insists the cages are a health and safety measure to stop the homeless breathing in harmful boiler fumes including carbon monoxide			1
one said rough sleepers had used the hot air vents last winter without causing any trouble , and a former student told @entity43 they have been used by homeless people since at least 2007			1
the issue was first raised in a blog by journalism student @entity47 - who said he was told by security guards there had been complaints about the rough sleepers from @entity6 staff and the public			1
mr @entity47 , 20 , wrote : ' they never caused any trouble , never littered nor gathered in groups			2
they were just content with finding a warm place to sleep at night			1
' as a @entity6 student the sight of this cage every morning makes me feel disgusted and ashamed of my own university , something i never thought i would feel			1
' surely allowing a homeless person to occasionally have a warm night ’s sleep is more beneficial for their health than having them out in the bitter cold			1
' history : a student who blogged about the issue said homeless people were there last year with no problems student @entity47 wrote : ' the sight of this cage every morning makes me feel disgusted and ashamed ' fellow student @entity79 added : ' surely sleeping in freezing cold and soaking wet conditions during the winter will cause more harm than the steam from the vent ever could			1
' another student , who did not want to be named , said : ' it is not just a matter of caring for homeless people - we should be see to be caring for them			1
' these ugly cages send out the message that we do n’t give a damn about people who are less fortunate than ourselves			0
' the homeless people who use them to keep warm are not doing any harm , all this stuff about dangerous fumes in nonsense			1
' one former student who began his degree in 2007 told @entity43 homeless people were a regular sight next to the vents throughout most of the time he studied in @entity108			1
the student , who asked not to be named , said : ' it was never any more than a couple of people and i never saw them being moved on			2
' usually you 'd just see someone sleeping in the corner at night or maybe the early morning			0
' it did take me by surprise the first time and i think i did tend to avoid walking through there at night sometimes			0
maybe that was prejudiced of me of course			0
' the university , whose motto is @entity127 , defended the ' safety cages ' and insisted they were to tackle safety concerns as part of an ' ongoing issue ' involving ' two or three ' homeless people			1
campus : the alleyway runs alongside the university 's main building ( pictured ) in @entity137 ' the decision to erect grilles was taken in the interests of health and safety , ' a spokesman said			2
' the area covered by the safety grilles are not hot air vents but boiler flue vents that can potentially produce products of combustion - diluted amounts of carbon monoxide being one of these - as part of the diluted boiler flue gases			1
' these vents are considered safe in normal use due to the type of flue dilution system being used but there could potentially be an increased risk if people are sleeping right next to the grilles for very long periods			2
' the university could not confirm how many complaints there had been			0
a university spokesman said the vents could emit carbon monoxide which would be harmful over time a spokesman for @entity172 said : ' we want assurances from @entity6 that they are in touch with agencies in the area to ensure rough sleepers are not just being moved on			1
' we want to know that they are not just washing their hands of the problem			0
' we need to be reassured that the university is in touch with local agencies to ensure that people sleeping rough in the area are helped			0
' you ca n't just turn your back on people sleeping rough even if there is a genuine health and safety reason			0
' @entity189 , chief executive of the @entity108 homelessness charity @entity191 , said : ' whether it 's a health and safety measure or a mechanism to move on homeless people i do n't think that is the issue			1
' the reality is people 's parents and children and brothers and sisters will be sleeping on the streets tonight and we need more measures to stop that			2
' moving someone on just puts them on someone else 's doorstep			0
' however , he added : ' although i ca n't comment on the validity of what the university is saying , we obviously do n't want to put homeless people 's health at risk '			1
a senior figure at homelessness charity @entity221 ’s @entity220 , which runs schemes across the south of @entity225 , said the measure appeared to be ' outrageous ' but distracted from the real issue			0
outreach director @entity228 said : ' whilst the " cage " appears outrageous , the real outrage is that each year thousands of people are forced to sleep rough in the @entity232 through lack of housing and services			2
' @entity108 's student union president @entity236 agreed with the university 's judgement			2
' if the relevant parties have said there 's an issue over health and safety i can see that would be a relevant reason , ' he said			0
' i ca n't imagine the university would want to be held responsible for any damage caused to people			0
anger : the row comes four months after metal ' spikes ' were installed at a luxury block of flats to deter the homeless from sleeping there			2
the blunt 1.5in studs caused outrage after a photo of them was put on @entity262 ' spikes ' : critics described the studs as ' inhumane ' and said rough sleepers were being treated like pigeons ' there 's probably also an issue if homeless people are sleeping there around cardboard boxes and quilts being put against these vents			1
' as a students ' union we do n't have a position on this as it 's not an issue we 've ever come across , but i investigated and spoke to security when this came about yesterday and i believe them			0
' @entity6 , established in 1883 , is the largest in @entity23 with around 55,000 students			2
the row comes four months after outrage over a luxury housing development which installed anti-homeless ' spikes '			0
hundreds of people signed an internet petition urging the 19 studs to be removed from an alcove next to the entrance of the privately - owned building in @entity295 , south @entity296			0
the clamour for their removal was joined by the @entity296 mayor @entity300			0
he said the ' spikes outside [ the ] @entity295 housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly , self - defeating and stupid			0
[ the ] developer should remove them as soon as possible '			0
studs and railings to discourage rough sleepers have been an increasingly common sight in the doorways and ledges of buildings in @entity232 for more than a decade .			0
