by @entity0 for most people , university is the perfect time for meeting new people and having wild , one - off experiences			2
but a worrying trend reported by @entity8 has found that such experiences are putting hundreds of students health at risk , as a shocking number are choosing to have unprotected sex			1
one 20 - year - old @entity15 student even admitted to the website that she ’d had unprotected sex with a fellow student knowing he had chlamydia			1
ready for bed ? @entity22 students are shunning condoms in favour of ' nights of passion ' ‘ he was completely honest about contracting the disease – we were even joking about it that night – but i just let the passion get the better of me , ’ said the woman , who wished to remain anonymous			1
‘ i knew that it was easy to treat and that there was a chance i would n’t get it at all , so i just thought “ f * * * * it ”			1
‘ i was pretty wasted at the time , which did n’t help			2
‘ now that i look back , i ca n’t believe how reckless i was – what if he had something else ? ’ it might seem shocking , but she is not the only student risking their health for a night of passion			1
online pharmacy @entity47 carried out research last week stating that 19 per cent of 18 to 30 - year - olds would have sex with someone knowing that their potential partner had an sti			1
' no condom ? no problem			1
' @entity58 reports trend of unsafe sex amongst @entity62 university students and , 39 per cent of these people claim they already have had unprotected sex with someone with an sti			1
another 26 per cent explained they would be happy to have sex with someone with an @entity55 because if they used protection it would be , ‘ impossible to catch it ’			1
some 11 per cent explained they would still have sex because they ‘ always let passion get the better of them			1
’ furthermore , another recent study has found that 39 % of students at the prestigious @entity22 have willingly had unprotected sex			1
but what ’s brought on this sudden disregard for safe sex ? many students at @entity62 universities say they 'd have sex with someone knowing the potential partner had an @entity55 ‘ we see a lot of university students , ’ @entity89 , nurse manager for young persons ’ health service @entity87 in @entity91 and @entity92 told @entity8			1
‘ the number of people who have come into our services enquiring about @entity55 testing has actually decreased in the last year , but the number of tests which come back positive has increased from 6.8 % to 7.6 % in only a year			1
‘ that ’s a worrying trend			2
’ @entity102 , who manages the sexual health clinic at the @entity104 , claims there is a ‘ massive @entity55 problem , ’ among students , despite raised awareness and publicity			1
‘ i suspect that @entity110 have increased amongst students in the last couple of years , ’ she said			1
‘ despite all the publicity and help available , students seem to be having more unprotected sex and are slow to get tested when they have			1
' @entity116 – a 19 - year - old first year ergonomics student at @entity117 – told @entity8 that having unprotected sex with a girl was the equivalent of getting a trophy			1
‘ i never wear condoms , and neither do most of the guys i know , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of guys i know from uni brag about not using condoms when they have sex with a girl			2
‘ it ’s mainly because they ’re uncomfortable and make you lose sensation			0
‘ also , there ’s nothing more unnatural than stopping stuff with a girl to strap on a bit of latex			0
‘ some girls do make a point of asking , but not that many of them insist on it			0
‘ the way i see it , everything is so easy to treat these days that it ’s not that big of a deal if you contract an sti			0
' how will i know if i 've got an sti ? different @entity110 have very different symptoms			0
and some have no symptoms at all			0
but if you can see or feel symptoms , these can include an unusual discharge from the vagina or penis , heavy periods or bleeding between periods , pain or burning sensation when passing urine , rashes , itching or tingling around the genitals or anus			0
what does a test involve ? tests for @entity110 vary			0
lots of services also offer urine testing , some can mean just taking a swab from the cervix or tip of the penis			0
sometimes you can swab yourself , other times a doctor or nurse will do the swab			0
others involve taking a blood sample			0
your health advisor can talk you through what will happen with the tests and anything you are worried about			0
can you get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex ? yes			2
some @entity110 , including @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 , are passed on through oral sex			2
to reduce the risk of infection , use a condom for oral sex			2
what happens if the test says i have an sti ? your clinic will encourage you to talk to your current partner and sometimes to your previous partners			0
this is so they can also be tested			0
and remember , most stis are treatable with antibiotics			0
how can i protect myself from @entity110 ? the best form of protection is to use a condom			0
and you can use a condom with any other form of contraception for the ultimate in safer sex			2
