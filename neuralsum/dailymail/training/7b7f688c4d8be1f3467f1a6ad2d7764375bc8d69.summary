a 12 - year - old boy has become the youngest person in @entity2 to have a gastric band fitted , as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic			1
the schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had the controversial weight - loss operations , despite recommendations that such high - risk surgery should be a last resort when other efforts to slim down have failed			1
figures seen by @entity16 show that 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach - shrinking surgery at @entity20 and private hospitals over a three - year period			1
they include the 12 - year - old , one boy aged 13 and two boys aged 15			1
professor @entity41 , head of paediatric dentistry at @entity43 , who regularly operates on obese children to remove decayed teeth , said it was ‘ a matter of national shame that we have these health problems when we are a wealthy , developed nation			2
the treatments i carry out all cost taxpayers money			2
‘ [ yet ] as a professional in my field i have to approach parents with great caution			2
i ca n’t accuse parents of anything			2
but of course the parent is responsible for the child ’s welfare and health			2
’ he added that social workers would be quick to step in at any sign of a parent abusing a child , ‘ yet you can have a child with up to 20 decayed teeth in their mouth , a big fat face , seriously ill and having to be admitted to hospital for a serious operation under general anaesthetic without consequence for the parent			0
’ @entity82 , 13 , visits @entity83 in @entity84 with her parents to be assessed for the £ 12,000 surgery ' one last treat ' : @entity82 and her family in @entity89 's - minutes after she was assessed for surgery his comments come as a new @entity94 documentary series reveals some of the extreme cases doctors have to deal with at specialist @entity20 clinics that offer gastric bands to under 18s			1
the two - part series called @entity100 : who ’s to blame ? features one 13 - year - old schoolgirl who weighs 16st			1
@entity82 , who came to @entity2 from @entity103 four years ago , visits @entity83 in @entity84 with her parents to be assessed for the £ 12,000 surgery			1
during a consultation about the operation , @entity82 ’s mother , who is not named in the programme , is questioned about the efforts her daughter has made to lose weight			1
speaking in broken @entity113 , she explains : ‘ we keep on diet , all three together			0
it was very good , but now we can not keep			0
she can not give up bread – she likes very much			0
’ the family are given a detailed diet plan when they leave in a final attempt to try reduce @entity82 ’s weight without surgery			1
but just 15 minutes later , the family are shown heading straight to a nearby @entity126 for ‘ one last treat ’			0
the documentary series also features children attending @entity20 obesity services in @entity131 and being treated for associated conditions such as dental decay			1
one of these youngsters is four - year - old @entity29 , who due to her weight struggles to fit into a uniform designed for nine - year - olds for her first day at school			1
in a shameful admission , her mother , referred to only by her first name @entity28 , says despite her daughter ’s obesity problems she continues to indulge her with sweets for an ‘ easy life ’			0
‘ i like to just have an easy life , ’ the 29 - year - old says			1
‘ i think everyone just wants an easy life			0
sometimes i think to myself no i should n’t give in – but i do			0
’ in another heartbreaking scene , @entity29 is seen in tears after surgery to remove eight of her teeth , which have badly decayed because of her sugary diet			1
but @entity28 seems equally unapologetic about the situation			0
she said : ‘ i know that ’s my fault , but it was easier for me on a night to give her a bottle of juice than to try to sit up with her all night and get her back to sleep			0
’ in the same documentary , consultant @entity166 , who works at @entity167 said : ‘ i think the parents have to be blamed for overweight children , but they have to be helped			0
critic : professor @entity41 blames parents ‘ although this is difficult for them – and we can understand chastising children and stopping them doing what they want is difficult – i ’m afraid that ’s their responsibility			0
it comes with being a parent			0
’ @entity82 ’s family also continues to make a string of excuses about their daughter ’s failure to reduce her dangerously high weight and why they are putting her forward for the surgery			1
her father @entity190 says : ‘ dieting , changing your eating style , is about the power of willing			0
‘ and we ’ve demonstrated we ’re not that strong			0
‘ she tried to lose weight when she was 11 and 12 , but got fatter and fatter			2
but with surgery you do n’t have to give up on temptations			2
’ @entity82 herself admits : ‘ my parents find it hard to keep to a diet			0
that ’s why i ca n’t keep to a diet because they find it hard			0
’ gastric band surgery is only offered to obese patients as a last resort , and children or teenagers must meet a strict criteria before they are even considered for the procedure			1
to qualify they must have a body mass index of more than 40 , have reached puberty , have first tried to slim through dieting or exercise , and have a full understanding of the psychological implications			2
but even with these stringent rules , @entity220 figures show the number of young people under 19 having gastric bands on the @entity20 doubled between 2007 and 2013 , when more than 200 children had the surgery			1
the average cost of the operation is more than £ 7,000			0
official statistics from the @entity230 , which is compiled from surgeons ’ reports , reveal that the 12 - year - old boy is the youngest child to have been fitted with a gastric band within this group , although it is not recorded if the operation was publicly or privately funded			1
@entity20 statisticians said the youngest patient they had on record for bariatric surgery paid for by the @entity242 was 13			2
however , many surgeons argue that the stomach bands could save the @entity20 money through reducing levels of obesity and associated illnesses such as type 2 diabetes , which are estimated to cost the @entity242 £ 5 billion a year			1
dr @entity250 , a clinical psychologist at @entity83 , said parents whose children are facing gastric band surgery can fail to take responsibility for their child ’s weight issues			1
she said : ‘ parents can be in denial of the part they have played			0
‘ but children need to be brought up to eat in such a way that they ’re nurturing their body rather than slowly damaging it			0
’ paediatric consultant @entity263 added : ‘ some parents , when they come to us , have the idea that if their child has the surgery it will act like a magic wand			2
’ @entity100 : who ’s to @entity271 will be broadcast on @entity94 at 10pm on wednesday .			1
