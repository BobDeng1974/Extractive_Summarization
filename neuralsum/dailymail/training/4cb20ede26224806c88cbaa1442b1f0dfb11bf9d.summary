by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 12:46 est , 24 october 2012 a pregnant woman who lost 41 pints of blood after she developed a severe form of pre-eclampsia has made a miracle recovery			1
@entity6 , 37 , and her husband @entity7 , 54 , are now at home with their baby daughter @entity9 just weeks after the traumatic culmination of her pregnancy			1
mrs @entity6 lost six pints of blood while undergoing an emergency caesarean section and continued losing blood as she was put into a 12 - hour induced coma in intensive care			1
@entity6 , 37 , with her husband @entity7 , 54 and their baby @entity21 she had developed hellp syndrome - a complication that affects one in five women who suffer severe pre-eclampsia - two weeks before her due date			1
@entity6 ’s organs began to fail as she suffered the loss of 41 pints of blood in total - five times the amount that is usually contained in a human body			1
@entity34 even ran out of blood platelets , with some having to be drafted in from a hospital in @entity37 70 miles away as a team of medics including three gynaecologists and four anaesthetists raced against time to stop @entity6 bleeding to death on the operating table			1
@entity7 , who rushed his wife to hospital 30 miles away from their home in @entity49 , @entity50 , has warned against the dangers of the deadly condition			0
he said : ' it ’s a miracle			0
i thought i was losing both of them			0
' during the early hours of october 5 , @entity7 heard @entity6 banging on the upstairs bedroom floor trying to get his attention			1
he found her vomiting blood and suffering chest pains and rushed her straight to hospital			1
@entity61 , known as @entity6 , was treated at @entity34			1
the hospital had to send to @entity37 general for extra blood he said : ' i did n’t know what was happening			1
i just knew that i had to do something			0
' i live 30 miles away from the hospital so i was n’t waiting for an ambulance			0
i got her into the car and rushed to hospital			0
' i was told later if i had been ten or 15 minutes longer , i could have lost them both			0
' within 20 minutes , @entity6 had been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and was on her way to theatre for an emergency caesarean at the @entity79			1
she then had to be transferred to @entity34 as medics continued working on her			0
@entity7 added : ' i ’m still in shock with it all , i ca n’t take it all on board			0
she was bleeding from her uterus and the surgeons could n’t find the point of bleeding to stem it			2
' it was like running a bath without the plug in			0
they could n’t find where the bleeding was coming from so they just had to keep pumping blood in			1
' things were n’t looking good but eventually they used a seaweed serum which showed where the bleeding was coming from so they could stop it			2
' the doctor told us she had never seen such a severe case of pre-eclampsia in her 35 years			2
' @entity104 is a severe form of pre-eclampsia and stands for ' haemolysis , elevated liver enzymes and low platelets '			1
@entity110 means that your blood cells start to break down			2
elevated liver enzymes means that your liver has become affected			0
low platelets means that the number of platelets in your blood is low and you are at risk of serious bleeding problems			1
the condition occurs in around one in 1,000 pregnancies			1
symptoms include fatigue , fluid retention , headaches , vomiting , blurry vision , abdominal pain and sometimes bleeding that wo n't stop			2
the main treatment is to deliver the baby immediately , even if premature , as complications can harm both mother and child			2
blood tranfusions may be required			2
women with a history of hellp syndrome are considered at increased risk for complications in future pregnancies			2
@entity6 and @entity142 , who was born two weeks early via caesarean section after nine days in hospital for both mum and baby they have now returned home and are recovering well from their ordeal			1
and baby @entity151 , who weighed in at 5lb 10oz , has arrived in time for the couple to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary			0
the family have thanked the staff at @entity34 and at the women and @entity158 for their life - saving efforts			2
@entity160 and decorator @entity7 added : ' they have given my wife and baby a life that was n’t going to be there			0
' it ’s also worth making pregnant ladies aware of just how easy this can happen because she had no problems throughout her pregnancy			0
' i would say to anybody out there - any partners or family members of pregnant women - you need to be there in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy			0
' this could happen to anybody and if i had n’t been there they may not have been saved			0
this could happen to anybody people have to be careful			0
