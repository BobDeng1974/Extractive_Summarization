' an earlier picture on @entity97 's @entity126 page of a young child brandishing a gun with the caption : ' one of dawlas youngest members ' another tweet fired off from @entity97 read : ' my ( provisions ) are beneath the shade of my sword			0
we live better than we lived in our country			0
' but these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on @entity97 's @entity126 page			0
earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that @entity169 has chosen not to describe or publish them			0
but one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption : ' one of dawlas [ sic ] youngest members ' - which was posted late may			0
@entity179 is arabic for country or state			0
other photos show @entity97 standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes			0

meanwhile about 150 @entity3 were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations , recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight			1
