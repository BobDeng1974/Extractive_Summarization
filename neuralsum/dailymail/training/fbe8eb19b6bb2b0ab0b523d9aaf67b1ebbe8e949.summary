by @entity0 the original cast from @entity4 's hit show @entity2 , have returned - all except @entity5 - to their roots in @entity8 and the first episode of the brand new season premieres on sunday			1
fans of the drama - filled first series wo n't be disappointed if @entity4 's @entity15 to @entity14 sneak peak trailer is anything to go by , particularly on the new baby front , as both @entity19 , 20 , and @entity20 , 25 , are pregnant			1
@entity19 and @entity22 's first child , a daughter who , according to many reports , they notoriously conceived before the breaking @entity14 cameras started rolling back in 2012 - long before they apparently ' met ' for the first time in season one - also seems to make an appearance , having been previously absent from the show			1
revealed ! in a sneak peek trailer for @entity4 's spin - off show , return to @entity14 , @entity22 is seen carrying his alleged first child , who was n't mentioned in the original breaking @entity14 show , wife @entity19 elsewhere in the trailer , @entity20 is seen experiencing some bizarre food cravings and both she and @entity19 are rushed to hospital on separate occasions			1
in one clip , the outspoken @entity20 , who was adopted into her @entity14 family as an infant , says to @entity42 , the show 's matriarch figure : ' you 've had a lot of kids			2
i heard that your * * * * * * gets really floppy			0
' there also appears to be an emotional fallout from the alleged hook up between @entity19 , who is now adjusting to married life with husband @entity22 following their return from @entity55 , and his very own brother @entity56			1
tensions : @entity22 ( left ) and a pregnant @entity19 ( right ) are settling into married life , with some difficulty , after a period of absence from home while they were exploring @entity55 in the first season of the show , breaking @entity14 @entity5 , 23 , who , in a shock move , has not returned to base camp and is instead in @entity55 perusing a raunchy career as a model , makes only a brief appearance in the trailer , but her presence is certainly felt back home			1
' tell me in a year from now she 's not going to be a porn star , ' says @entity75 , pointing to a newspaper advert of his former chum , clad in lacy underwear			0
' all we ever do is sit around and bitch about @entity5 all day and i 'm getting tired of it , ' argues @entity20 in a separate clip			0
expecting : also pregnant is @entity20 ( pictured ) , who is filmed experiencing some bizarre food cravings and , at one point , seemingly being rushed to hospital tensions also appear to be running high when one new cast member busts @entity56 for having a cell phone , throwing ( and breaking ) it in a rage			0
self - confessed ' rebel ' @entity92 's love life is also highlighted throughout the series , as is @entity42 's ongoing struggles with being shunned by the community			0
and as @entity56 is newly released from jail for a 2013 marijuana conviction , he appears to be trying to mend his relationship with his family - a work in progress at best			0
racy : @entity5 ( pictured ) barely makes an on screen appearance in the trailer , but old chum @entity92 is seen pointing to this newspaper ad and loudly predicting that she will turn into a ' porn star ' as part of her new life in @entity55 return to @entity14 is a spin - off of the original first series of @entity2 , which saw the five young @entity114 adults - four @entity14 and one @entity115 - leave their sheltered community and experience the bright lights of @entity55			1
at the end of their stay , all the cast members were documented struggling with the decision of whether or not to return to the communities in which they grew up , or brave the modern world alone			0
the show 's second season , breaking amish : @entity128 followed an entirely different cast on their trip to @entity132 , and those characters will not be featured in return to @entity14			2
round two : original series , @entity2 , followed ( from left ) , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity19 , @entity92 and @entity5 , on their travels to @entity55 , all of whom have now returned to @entity8 except for @entity5 breaking @entity14 , which averaged about three million viewers in its first season , has repeatedly come under fire following revelations which have thrown its ' reality ' status into question			1
while each cast member originally claimed to have grown up in the strict communities , plenty of evidence has surfaced suggesting they all have decidedly dark pasts - involving divorce , children and time away from the faith			2
and with the exception of @entity19 and @entity20 - who have both been married and divorced before the show begun - every member of the breaking @entity14 cast has a police record			2
the two - hour premiere of @entity15 to @entity14 begins on sunday at 9/8c with a holiday reunion .			0
