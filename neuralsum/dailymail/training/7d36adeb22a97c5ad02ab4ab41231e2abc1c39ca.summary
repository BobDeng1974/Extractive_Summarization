by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ the 101st @entity2 starts this weekend and for the first time in its history it begins in @entity5			1
the race may be famed for its picturesque stages around the @entity9 and famous finish on the @entity11 in @entity12 , this year the tour will add the @entity13 and places like @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to the list a beautiful backdrops			0
and while the @entity20 wo nâ€™t be decided until the riders reach the @entity9 , the likes of defending champion @entity23 and @entity24 may be surprised to learn that the steepest part of the course will come a lot earlier than that - in @entity28			1
at its steepest @entity32 has a 33 per cent maximum gradient and comes towards the end of a gruelling day of cycling			2
ready to go : @entity50 gets ready for the start of the @entity2 pride of @entity30 : the riders will go through the picturesque @entity13 it is only 800m long but the ramp is so severe and arrives so late in the day that it will provide the perfect platform for late attack to try and win the stage			2
it will be a good place for spectators to watch as the severity of the climb will mean the cyclists will be moving very slowly as they make their way to the top of the hill			0
at the @entity70 the winner of the @entity69 and @entity20 will be remembered , but maybe there should also be a prize for the conqueror of @entity32 .			0

@entity2 starts in @entity5 for the first time in race *'s* history
@entity32 in @entity28 is the steepest part of the race
riders will have to *negotiate* 33 per cent gradient on climb on stage two of the race
