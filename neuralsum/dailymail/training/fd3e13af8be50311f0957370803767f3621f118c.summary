if you find @entity1 overwhelming and @entity2 just too much , a new social network aims to make communication even simpler			2
@entity5 , set to launch later this year , will only allow its users to send emoji to each other			1
even usernames on the system will be emoji - and over 10,000 people have already signed up			1
the words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media , blogs and global media			2
other terms to make the list include ' futebol ’ , and ' ghost plane ' - relating to the missing @entity35 plane			0
' we 've just passed 10,000 usernames reserved , the firm said on its @entity2 feed			1
' fortunately there are more than 250,000 possible two - emoji combos , so most are still available ! ' the site was set up by @entity45 @entity44 and @entity46 , who say they were inspired by @entity48 , which allows users to simply send the word @entity48			1
' the two of us had the idea at about the same time — we were n’t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too , ' @entity44 told @entity57			1
' at that point , we burst out laughing and realized we had to build it			0
' however , the pair have so far refused to say exactly how the app will work			0
@entity63 ( selection pictured ) were originally popular in @entity64 , and widely used online , however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			0
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji ) earlier this year it was revealed @entity72 is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the @entity75			1
following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough , the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them			0
because @entity63 have to be displayed on different devices , they are tightly controlled by the @entity83			0
at present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white			1
however , only two of the symbols seem to be @entity91 and none are black			0
since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the @entity83 - a @entity94 - based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms , software producers , user groups and others			0
emoji were originally popular in @entity64 , and widely used online			1
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			0
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )			1
icons are standardised and include some specific to @entity107 culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , @entity107 curry , and sushi			1
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into @entity83 , allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added			1
@entity2 allowed emoji to be used on its web version , as well across its apps , last month			1
it does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set			0
the latest disclosure came after @entity72 boss @entity131 was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue			0
the diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to @entity137 calling on @entity72 to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard			2
' of the more than 800 @entity143 , the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely @entity91 and another in a turban , ' it says			2
' there 's a white boy , girl , man , woman , elderly man , elderly woman , blonde boy , blonde girl and , we 're pretty sure , [ video game character ] @entity154			0
' a petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to @entity72 's keyboard ' but when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys , there 's a staggering lack of minority representation			2
' it added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same - sex couple , and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones .			2
