following a month floating in space , the last of a group of ' super moustronauts ’ has been dissected			1
astronauts cut open 10 out of 20 mice to send tissue samples back on the @entity8 capsule that returned to @entity9 on saturday			1
the rest of the mice were dissected on monday and are due to be returned to @entity9 on december 9 as part of @entity14 ’s tissue research			1
these mice lacked a gene that normal mice have , called @entity23 1 ( @entity24 - 1 ) , which causes muscles to deteriorate			1
they have now been dissected and tissue samples sent back to @entity9 this group of mice included some that lacked a gene that normal mice have , called @entity23 1 ( @entity24 - 1 ) , which causes muscles to deteriorate			1
scientists claim that by analysing the super mice in microgravity , they could create drugs for use by humans to prevent muscle loss on @entity9			1
these ‘ super mice ’ were the first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space			1
the typical stay for mice for previous missions has been around two weeks			0
@entity45 is responsible for marking proteins for destruction in both human and mouse muscles			0
@entity14 created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station , which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around it also plays a key role in accelerated muscle loss through ageing and other chronic diseases			1
six national space programs have so far flown animals into space : the @entity63 , the @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
they were used as surrogates to test the suitability of the space environment for human habitation			0
fruit flies were the first animals to be sent into orbit when they were put on board a @entity64 - launched v - 2 rocket on february 20 , 1947			0
two years later , @entity79 , a @entity80 , became the first monkey to go into space			0
in november 1957 @entity83 sent @entity84 the dog into orbit aboard the @entity63 @entity88 spacecraft			0
then , on january 31 , 1961 , @entity89 became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the @entity14 space programme			0
for their mission , @entity14 created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station , which included systems to stop their food and water from floating around			2
' by flying a mouse , whose typical lifespan is much shorter than humans ' , you can follow the course of bone and muscle loss over a much greater percentage of the mouse lifespan than you can in humans , ' @entity102 , the @entity103 in @entity105 's senior research manager , told @entity117 at @entity118			1
this is of particular interest to space agencies who are racing to get the first humans on @entity124			2
any astronaut undertaking the journey will need to spend long stretches in space			2
however , microgravity in space means that astronauts no longer need to use certain muscles , causing them to slowly waste away			2
' muscles are the storage space for amino acids , the only reservoir for them , ' said @entity139 , @entity140 for @entity142 program manager			2
' if you lose muscle , you lose health			0
' the mice were the first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space			1
the typical stay for mice in earlier experiments has been around two weeks			0
pictured are researchers preparing the mice for launch			0

mice were first mammals , excluding humans , to spend a month in space
they have been cut open by astronauts and tissue sent back to @entity9
they lacked a gene that normal mice have called @entity23 1
this gene , which is also found in humans , causes muscles to deteriorate
scientists hope that by analysing the super mice in microgravity , they will be able to create drugs for use by humans to prevent muscle loss on @entity9
