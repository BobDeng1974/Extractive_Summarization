@entity0 were put through their final paces on friday while coming to terms with a slapstick setback , as @entity4 was ruled out of the first test against @entity6 following an ‘ hilarious ’ training - ground accident that soon turned sour			1
the @entity9 scrum - half was officially withdrawn from saturday ’s series opener against the @entity11 at @entity12 once it became apparent that he had failed to recover from a shoulder injury in time to play			1
his removal means that @entity16 of @entity17 will join forces with @entity19 in an untried half - back combination , while @entity21 comes on to the bench			1
it emerged that @entity4 ’s injury stemmed from an incident on monday that initially prompted much amusement among team - mates and management			1
asked how the 27 - year - old had hurt his shoulder , defence coach @entity29 said : ‘ it ’s his own fault actually			1
tradition : the @entity0 team walk onto the pitch during the @entity37 at @entity12 put your back into it : @entity41 pushes a weights sled grappling : the @entity0 team warm up during the training session pulling : @entity44 , the @entity0 centre , pulls a weights sled during the training session hard at work : @entity48 pushes a weights sled as @entity0 train for the final time the @entity11 have n’t lost at @entity12 since 1994			1
they were beaten by @entity52 20 years ago but have since won 31 tests in a row			2
‘ it was a s * * t kick			1
he actually stubbed his foot on the floor , missed the ball completely and it was absolutely hilarious			1
he fell over and hurt his shoulder			1
i burst out laughing but then realised it was n’t too funny			2
‘ it was a little grubber through on the floor , which he mis - kicked			1
he wo n’t be doing it again			2
i ’ve got it on tape			2
i showed it to all the lads the next day ; it was hilarious			2
but it was n’t quite as good two days later when he was n’t playing in the test match			2
anyway , we ’ll get over it			2
’ the joke lost its appeal very quickly , as the loss of @entity4 is another grievous blow to @entity77 hopes of causing an upset in the opening clash with the world champions			1
he was an integral part of the team ’s attacking development during the @entity84 and his vibrant presence will be sorely missed			0
yet , @entity29 suggested the coaches are optimistic that the @entity88 will be available for selection in @entity90 next week			0
‘ he was very close , ’ he said			0
‘ he 's a couple of days off and we expect him to be fully fit for next week , but his strength was n't quite there			2
lookout : @entity97 runs the rule over his @entity0 charges at @entity12 faster ! @entity101 takes a sprint test as @entity0 prepare for the @entity11 where 's the pass ? @entity105 takes control of the ball during training ‘ he 's settling down nicely , but the player has to be mentally right that he 's 100 per cent fit			1
we have good replacements in @entity113			0
@entity4 will rest this one out and start training again on monday and tuesday next week			1
‘ he 's been in great form , not just throughout the @entity84 when he was outstanding , but he finished the season really well at @entity9			0
in general he was in very confident mood coming over here and was looking forward to the tour			0
’ @entity0 have been beset by the absence of so many leading lights for this first test , due to a pile - up of injuries and fixtures			1
but the tourists are refusing to be demoralised and accept a grisly fate against @entity129 ’s experienced , outstanding @entity128 team			0
@entity29 claimed that the visitors will take heart from some rousing performances and results on the road in the last two years			0
‘ we ’re not frightened of the occasion – of going to these places and giving it a good crack , ’ he said			0
' for some of these guys , it ’s new to come here , it was new to go to @entity144 and for some of them it was new to play in @entity148			0
everything is new to us but we do n’t shirk it			0
there is always a fighting spirit there			0
the fighting spirit has been in this team since the start			0
’ sitting it out : @entity4 ( right ) will miss @entity0 's first test with @entity6 on saturday blow : care ( left ) was injured in a training ground incident when he fell on his shoulder after taking a kick coming through : @entity165 holds onto the ball during the @entity0 training session tough task : @entity0 are preparing to face @entity6 but will be huge underdogs breather : @entity171 takes a break after the training session preparation : @entity0 face a daunting challenge in @entity6 the @entity11 have n’t lost at @entity12 since 1994			1
their imperious record in their @entity178 lair and their dominance of this rivalry over the decades is a grim omen for @entity0 , but they are determined to ignore it			0
‘ we know we ’ve only won twice here , ’ said @entity29			0
‘ we know we ’ve only beaten the @entity11 seven times			0
‘ we are aware of the history , but we ’re more aware of our own history of late and that ’s a side that started two years ago and guys are averaging 20 - 25 caps			2
they ’ve been through a journey together and we ’re seeing the improvements			0
there ’s still a long way to go , but we need to come to places like @entity6 , to test ourselves and see where we ’re at			1

@entity4 will miss @entity6 test after falling in training
scrum - half fell after missing the ball when *attempting* a kick
care should be fit for the second test
