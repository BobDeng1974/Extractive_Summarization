by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 09:57 est , 10 december 2012 it was once the most watched show on television			1
but not even the final of @entity4 , with all its glitz and glamour , could stop its dismal decline			1
millions more viewers deserted the ailing talent show for the first stage of the competition ’s final on saturday night with an average of just 9.3million tuning in – 1.3million fewer than the same show last year			1
it is the show ’s lowest ratings for a final in seven years , when 9.2million watched @entity21 triumph in 2005			1
new low : just 9.3million viewers tuned in to see finalists @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 sing on saturday night stars : the show had its lowest ratings since 2007 despite performances from star turns including @entity32 , left , and @entity33 , right this was despite performances from @entity32 and up - and - coming pop star @entity33 – as well as the drama of a public vote , which saw former cruise ship singer @entity26 leave the show			1
the eventual winner was 24 - year - old singer - songwriter @entity24 who beat supermarket worker @entity25 , 21			2
this year ’s @entity4 series , the ninth in the show ’s history , has struggled with tumbling ratings , recording an average of 8.9million viewers , almost two million fewer than last year			1
winner : @entity24 , right , beat @entity25 in last night 's @entity4 final two years ago , the show was hitting an average of 14.1million each week and the final show of the series attracted almost 20million viewers			1
the fall in ratings has been blamed on the departure of @entity58 from the judging panel			0
he left after the 2010 series to concentrate on @entity62			0
he was replaced by @entity64 star @entity63 , 41 , whose future on the show is now said to be uncertain			2
there are now suggestions that the judging panel , which also includes @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 singer @entity72 , is set for a revamp ahead of next year ’s series			0
yesterday ’s show was further overshadowed when @entity26 dramatically quit hours before it started , reportedly abusing staff following a late - night drinking session			1
he was due to appear on stage last night to sing with his fellow contestants but turned up late to rehearsals yesterday after returning to his @entity84 hotel at 4am			2
x factor staff were dispatched to find him when he failed to turn up at 11am			2
he was then said to have abused staff members who decided he was unable to take part in the final run - through			1
he also reportedly verbally abused fellow contestant @entity89			0
shortly after , he told staff that he did not want to appear on last night ’s show			1
an @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity93 decided he no longer wanted to be part of the @entity4 final and has gone back to @entity95			2
’ an @entity4 source said that his place on the show ’s lucrative tour was now in jeopardy and he may not be allowed to return			2
it would mean the singer may miss out on £ 100,000 he would earn for taking part			0
the source said : ‘ @entity104 will be talking to him in the next few days			0
’ if she was feeling unloved , this superfan would have made it all better			0
the young woman simply could n’t contain her hysteria at seeing @entity111 outside a @entity113 nightclub			0
however , miss @entity111 ’s mind appeared to be elsewhere as she went on to party the night away with her boyfriend @entity115 , her mother and brother			0
yesterday it emerged the pop star is suing the @entity73 version of @entity4 for £ 1.4million in unpaid fees			0
the 29 - year - old was left humiliated after @entity58 sacked her from the @entity73 show after just four days ’ filming			1
she was paid her full £ 1.1million fee but now her legal team has taken action against the show ’s production company , stating her contract included payment for a second season , despite the fact she did not complete the first run			0
oh my @entity135 ! the fan ca n't believe her eyes , was it really her ?			0

saturday night 's x factor show attracted just 9.3million viewers - the lowest for a final since 2005
the low figure was despite appearances from @entity32 and @entity33
