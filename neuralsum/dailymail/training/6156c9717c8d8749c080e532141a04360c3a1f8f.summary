facebook by @entity1 published : 04:19 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 10 may 2013 there is little argument that @entity0 has become part of the fabric of social interaction over the past few years			1
from a forum to share photos and events to a way to reconnect with old friends , there are many positives to the social networking phenomenon , however it also has the ability to drive many of its users mad			0
hundreds of new digital social faux pas and annoyances have emerged from @entity0 , and vlogger @entity22 , with the help of radio presenter and friend @entity25 , has identified ten of the worst offenders in her latest video			1
@entity22 tackles the downsides of the ever present @entity0 in her latest video , complete with her signature comic sketches 1			1
couples who feel the need to broadcast their love for each other … every day whether you are single or loved up yourself , the irritation of couples who post updates on every ( perfectly sickening ) stage of their relationship is universal			1
@entity22 points out : ‘ ok , you ’re in love , but i do n’t need to be reminded how in love you are everyday on @entity0			1
people pretend to lead the perfect life while we all might be guilty of it to some degree , the filtering of life ’s highs and lows to leave only posed , smiling faces in fabulous surroundings can begin to grate after one or two scrolls through your news feed			0
while you might feel anything but happy ( left ) your @entity0 page will still display your life as perfect ( right ) 3			2
it provides a platform for people to brag an extension of reason two , @entity0 also provides a platform for those who , not content with merely implying their life is perfect , feel the need to specifically announce it			2
you might have a dream job , a loving husband and two perfect children at the moment , but as @entity22 points out : ‘ you know what , not everyone ’s life is that perfect right now , so you ’re just rubbing your perfect life in our faces			2
@entity0 causes a ridiculous number of arguments from ‘ liking ’ the wrong status , accepting a friend request from a friend ’s enemy , to the minefield of ‘ relationship status ’ , @entity0 causes arguments at an astonishing rate			1
ironically , since it is ultimately designed as a social network to bring people together , @entity0 now causes arguments that prior to its existence , simply would not have happened			2
people have personal conversations on it for all to see a perfect way to indulge your nosy side - or end up feeling very left out - is to go on @entity0			1
people continue to have private discussions out in the very open forum of the ‘ wall ’ , perfectly aware that their plans to meet up or holiday in - jokes can be read by all their friends			0
tagging when performed by anyone but yourself probably the most universally annoying thing about @entity0 is the ‘ tagging ’ function on photos			2
from drunken nights you ’d rather forget , to angles that make you look like a portly gargoyle , everyone will have been tagged in a unflattering photo			0
@entity22 puts it well when she says : ‘ @entity121 , it ’s a dangerous game when you ’re not in control			0
’ @entity0 causes what may seem ridiculous , but yet are very real , arguments 7			0
whenever the weather reaches an extreme , everyone feels the need to post it come sun , rain or snow , one thing that can be relied upon in the unstable @entity132 weather is that people will post about it on @entity0			0
this despite the fact that we all will be experiencing exactly the same inclement or pleasant climate – for real			0
attention seekers can go to town with cryptic and depressing statuses @entity0 provides a platform like no other for those who wish to illicit a reaction and glean attention from their friends			0
we all know they want you to ask what 's wrong and offer sympathy , but whether or not they are actually sad / depressed / in crisis , @entity0 is not he forum to publicise it			0
the perils of tagged photographs is demonstrated by @entity22 's friend , and @entity159 radio presenter @entity25 9			1
the new ‘ seen ’ button means you can no longer pretend to have not read messages yet another social faux pas created by @entity0 , the ‘ seen ’ button meaning that sidestepping invitations you ’d rather miss or awkward messages you would rather avoid has become much more difficult			1
your only options when someone adds you are ‘ confirm ’ and ‘ not now ’ @entity22 sums this annoyance up best when she says : ‘ why do i have a choice of ‘ not now ’ ? where is the ‘ never ’ button ? ! ’ see more of @entity22 's videos on her @entity175 channel here follow @entity22 on twitter			1
