when authorities found the bodies of the two children - 2 - year - old @entity18 and 3 - year - old @entity22 - the thermometers used to measure their body temperatures maxed out at 107 degrees			2
additionally , the report states , 25 - year - old @entity23 knew the car in which she locked the children did n't even work , which has investigators doubting her claim that the children 's death was just a tragic accident			1
monster : @entity23 had her children living in filth before allegedly killing them by leaving them locked in a hot car tragedy : @entity23 's daughter , @entity39 , 3 , cooked to death after she was left in the back of a hot car with her brother , @entity18 , 2 filth : crime scene photos show piles of filth strewn about @entity23 's home @entity23 has since been been charged with two counts each of murder and aggravated child abuse in the august , 2012 deaths of her two children			1

the @entity56 of child services recently released thousands of pages of child death records , including 44 pages about the deaths of the @entity22 children			0
the names of children were redacted from the reports , but the @entity9 was able to independently confirm the pages related to the deaths of the @entity22 children			0
the records paint a grisly picture of life for the children in their mother 's home , which was later condemned due to its dreadful condition			0
' the children did not have beds and the walls in the room had food and feces smeared and splattered on them , ' records state			0
' when the children were found deceased they were found to have cuts on their hands and they were filthy			0
' gross : authorities say @entity23 's home was without a working toilet neglect : amongst the mounds of filth , authorities found piles of soiled diapers inside the home records and photographs of the home taken after the deaths of the two children show mounds of garbage , rotting food , fast food bags , piles of soda cans , used diapers and cigarette burns on the walls and floors			1
additionally , investigators discovered that the home had no working toilet			0
but the investigation into the deaths was n't the first time authorities paid a visit to @entity23 's house of filth - in both october of 2010 and october of 2011 , @entity113 sent child neglect investigators to the home to follow up on allegations of environmental neglect and lack of supervision after neighbors found the children wandering around outside as @entity23 was sleeping			1
in each case @entity113 investigators determined that there were ' no services needed			0
' on the day of the alleged murders , paramedics rushed to @entity23 's home after she called 9 - 1 - 1 from a neighbors house to report that she found the children unresponsive in the car			1
stars and bars : investigators say they found feces smeared all over the walls in @entity23 's home yuck : rotting food was amongst the many filthy attributes found in @entity23 's decaying home dropped the ball : @entity149 officials were called to @entity23 's home at least twice but took no action in either case temperatures outside were about 99 degrees the day the children were locked into their car seats in the back of @entity23 's inoperable vehicle , and investigators estimate that the temperature inside the car was upwards of 140 degrees			1
initially , @entity23 told police that she strapped the children into their car seats and then went inside and fell asleep			2
but @entity23 's story repeatedly changed - after first admitting to putting the kids in the car , @entity23 later told police ' she does remember putting them in the car			2
' additionally , a relative of @entity23 's told authorities that the car did n't work and that she ' never drove it			1
' the children 's father was at work the day they were killed and has not been charged with any crimes .			2

@entity177 were called to the home of @entity23 at least twice before the august 2012 death of her two *toddlers*
each time , @entity149 *declined* to take any action
authorities *suspect* the temperature in the car when the children died was roughly 140 degrees
a relative told authorities that car did n't even work and that @entity23 never drove it
@entity23 's claim that the children 's death was a ' tragic accident '
