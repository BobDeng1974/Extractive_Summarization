amid the horror of a @entity3 concentration camp , liberated by the @entity4 70 years ago this week , love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her ss guards			1
but the love between @entity12 soldier , sergeant @entity11 , 24 at the time , and teenage @entity15 girl @entity14 , 20 , was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp 's @entity12 commander @entity18			1
this week survivors and liberators of the notorious @entity23 camp in northern @entity24 gathered to commemorate the day @entity12 soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible			1
@entity14 and @entity11 were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years , pictured before his passing in 1995 @entity11 pictured as a young soldier in the @entity33 in his early 20s ( l ) and @entity34 as a young girl ( r ) @entity14 , weighing only a few pounds was , like many others in the camp , a walking skeleton , for whom certain death was only days away			1
among the recently dead was @entity42 girl @entity41 whose diaries while hiding from the @entity44 in @entity45 became world renowned			0
but through the striped and filthy prison uniform , sergeant @entity11 of the 53 @entity48 section of @entity33 , spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her			2
before long @entity11 had fallen in love with the young @entity55 girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again			1
@entity41 , whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the @entity44 became the defining account of the @entity62 , was just one of @entity23 's many victims			1
@entity64 was living in the @entity42 when the @entity44 seized it in 1940 , leaving them trapped			0
in 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside @entity64 's office building			0
they spent two years there , but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps			0
@entity41 , and her sister @entity71 , were taken to @entity23 , where they died of typhus in february 1945 , just months before the @entity74 liberated it			1
@entity23 's ss commandant , the cruel and tyrannical @entity75 , was among those @entity11 helped to round up and capture			1
other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit			0
@entity11 became so besotted with @entity14 that he told her he was going to marry her one day			1
but here the story could have ended had it not been for @entity18 , the new commanding officer of what became @entity83			0
with @entity11 posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of @entity87 , there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever			2
@entity18 , who is now 95 , was the commanding officer of liberated @entity23			2
he played cupid for soldier @entity11 and @entity14			1
pictured in uniform ( l ) and more recently ( r ) @entity23 was located in northern @entity24 , south - west of the town of @entity23 itself			2
from 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were killed there along with 20,000 @entity98 inmates the @entity83 was liberated on 15 april 1945 by the @entity99 and soldiers discovered roughly 60,000 starved , and ill prisoners inside			0
13,000 unburied corpses littered the ground around the camp when they arrived when the @entity74 arrived at @entity23 , it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak , with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day			2
a sombre sign erected by the @entity4 , and photographed by mr @entity113 , documents at least part of that grisly death tool , revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid			0
shortly after the camp was liberated by @entity12 and @entity121 troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the @entity125 flag and @entity127 portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames			2
@entity129 , now 95 and living in retirement , took a personal interest in their unlikely romance , making sure messages to each other reached their destination in the chaos of the post-liberation activity			1
@entity129 wrote about his experiences in ' @entity140 ' and gave evidence at the @entity23 war crimes trials			2
his son , @entity143 said : ' my father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions			0
without him , they might well have lost touch			0
' historic : as a crowd of people watch on , @entity12 troops burn the buildings to the ground horrific : around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the @entity74 arrived the camp , which became the final resting place of 50,000 jews , @entity163 , homosexuals , @entity3 opponents and those with disabilities , is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 once @entity14 had been released from her living hell and been restored to health , @entity11 and she married and started lived in @entity172			1

@entity11 died in 1995 , two months short of their golden wedding anniversary			2
he passed away a few years ago but @entity14 was prominent this week in the anniversary of @entity23 's liberation			1
@entity14 at a book launch with @entity129 's son , @entity143 , who said : ' my father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions ' she said : ' today it is hard to imagine what it was like in the camp , people so thin and so defeated that it was hard to tell if they were men or women			1
' i spent many days with @entity41			0
she was a beautiful , sweet girl but she got ill and i was with her to almost the last			0
she gazed into the distance as the days went by and i could tell she had gone			0
' i was lucky and for that i can thank @entity129			0
he was a wonderful man and made sure that @entity11 and i kept our romance alive in the most testing conditions			1
' we had him to thank for a wonderful marriage and for coming together at a time when it would have been easy to have lost touch			0
