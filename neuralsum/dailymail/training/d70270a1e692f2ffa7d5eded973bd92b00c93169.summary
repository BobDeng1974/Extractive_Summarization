unattractive people are more memorable than pretty ones , unless a beautiful person has distinctive facial features , like @entity4 the old maxim of never forgetting a pretty face might be untrue as psychologists believe beautiful people are less likely to be recognised			1
a new study suggests that attractiveness can actually prevent the recognition of faces , unless a pretty face is particularly distinctive			1
@entity15 psychologists think the recognition of pretty faces is distorted by emotions			1
scientists at the @entity19 , @entity15 , discovered that photos of unattractive people were more memorable than pretty ones when they showed them to a group of people			1
however , people were able to easily remember a beautiful face with distinctive features , such as @entity4 ’s			1
researchers @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 from the university , wrote in their study : ‘ we could show that the test subjects were more likely to remember unattractive faces than attractive ones , when the latter did n't have any particularly noticeable traits			1
’ for the study , which was published in science magazine @entity38 , the psychologists showed photos of faces to test subjects			1
half of the faces were considered to be more attractive and the other half as less attractive - but all of them were being thought of as similarly distinctive looking			2
the scientists assume emotional influences distort the recognition of pretty faces			2
they used eeg - recordings which show the brain 's electric activity during the memory tests			0
a stock image of a man with electrodes on his head is pictured a recent study found beautiful people do better in their careers – even after their youthful good looks have begun to fade			1
at each career stage studied , pretty people held more prestigious jobs than plain @entity66			2
researcher @entity67 , of @entity69 ’s @entity68 , said good looking people may benefit from a ‘ beauty premium ’			0
she added : ‘ we found facial attractiveness is important in determining people ’s occupational prestige at the beginning of the career as it is in the middle or at the end			2
’ the study tracked the career outcomes of more than 8,000 people and found the best looking were more successful throughout their whole lives			1
' or , in other words , the so called beauty premium is stable throughout people 's employment history and pretty people are doing better even as they age			2
' the test subjects were shown the faces for just a few seconds to memorise them and were shown them again during the test so that they could decide if they recognised them or not			0
the scientists were surprised by the result			0
‘ until now we assumed that it was generally easier to memorise faces , which are being perceived as attractive - just because we prefer looking at beautiful faces , ’ dr @entity26 said			1
but the study showed that such a correlation can not be easily sustained			0
he assumes that remembering pretty faces is distorted by emotional influences , which enhance the sense of recognition at a later time			0
the researchers ’ idea is backed up by evidence from eeg - recordings which show the brain ’s electric activity , which the scientists used during their experiment			0
the study also revealed that in the case of attractive faces , considerably more false positive results were detected			0
in other words , people thought they recognised a face without having seen it before			0
‘ we obviously tend to believe that we recognise a face just because we find it attractive , ’ dr @entity26 said .			0

a study by the @entity19 in @entity15 found photos of unattractive people were more recognisable than pretty ones
beautiful faces with distinctive features like @entity4 's are memorable
