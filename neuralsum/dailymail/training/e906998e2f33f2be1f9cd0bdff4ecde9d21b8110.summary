accusations of drinking among @entity2 during late - night debates spread like wildfire this weekend as they brought the government ever closer to a shutdown			1
members of the political press corps made the claims from @entity10 on saturday night			2
@entity12 reporter @entity11 tweeted : ' i 'm not over exaggerating when i say i can smell the booze wafting from members as they walk off the floor			1
' there were reports from other sources of members of @entity21 ' putting a few back ' on @entity23 - presumably referring to @entity24 in downtown @entity26 reporter added that she had run into two politicians in a liquor store			1
all work and no play ... rumors ran riot last night that @entity32 in the @entity2 were drinking during the debates on @entity10 names of those letting their hair down in the midst of pressing government business have yet to emerge			1
the rumors of drinking came as @entity32 voted to halt president @entity42 's plans to overhaul @entity44 healthcare			1
the move could lead to the first government shutdown in almost two decades			0
the @entity47 - controlled @entity2 approved legislation early on sunday imposing a one - year delay in key parts of the nation 's health care law and repealing a tax on medical devices as the price for avoiding a partial government shutdown in a few days ' time			1
even before the @entity2 voted , @entity58 pledged to reject the measure and the @entity2 issued a statement vowing a veto in any event			1
@entity32 are pursuing ' a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown , ' it said			1
boozing ? congressional reporter for @entity67 tweeted this message late on saturday night from @entity10 shaming : @entity69 , a reporter on @entity10 for @entity70 , shared a similar statement about politicians enjoying a few beverages with her followers spreading like wildfire : members of the public were keen to know just which members of the @entity2 had been hitting the bar the @entity58 is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on monday , ten hours before a shutdown would begin , and even some @entity32 said privately they feared that senate majority leader @entity81 , @entity82 , held the advantage in the fast - approaching end game			1
if so , a @entity2 @entity47 rank - and - file that includes numerous tea party allies would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown in nearly two decades - or coming away empty - handed from their latest confrontation with @entity42			1
undeterred , @entity2 @entity32 pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a concession from the @entity2 in exchange for letting the government open for business normally on tuesday			1
' @entity95 is based on a limitless government , bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will of the people , ' said rep. @entity101 , @entity102 another @entity47 , rep. @entity103 of @entity104 , reacted angrily when asked whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if needed to prevent a shutdown			0
' how dare you presume a failure ? how dare you ? how dare you ? ' he said			0
demands : speaker of the house @entity111 is followed by reporters			0
@entity32 are attempting to delay @entity95 by one year			1
( there is no suggestion that anyone pictured was involved in drinking ) apart from its impact on the health care law , the legislation that @entity2 @entity32 decided to back would assure routine funding for government agencies through december 15			1
under @entity2 rules , the measure went to the @entity58 after lawmakers voted 248 - 174 to repeal the medical tax , then 231 - 192 for the one - year delay in @entity95			1
a companion measure to assure @entity44 troops are paid in the event of a shutdown passed unanimously			1
the government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands by @entity32 , who passed legislation several days ago that would permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding for the government			1
it also contained significant concessions from a party that long has criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates on industry , in some cases far exceeding what @entity32 have been willing to support in the past			2
acknowledging as much , rep. @entity151 , @entity152 , said that as a conservative he had often found during @entity42 's presidency that his choice was ' between something bad or ( something ) horrible '			1
@entity47 aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote , most portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would remain unchanged			0
that includes requirements for insurance companies to guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children to be covered on their parents ' plans until age 26			0
it would not change a part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription drug expenses			0
ne exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage , based on religious or moral objections			0
the measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals to purchase coverage or face a penalty , and of a separate feature of the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for coverage from private insurers			0
by repealing the medical device tax , the @entity47 measure also would raise deficits â€” an irony for a party that won the @entity2 majority in 2010 by pledging to get the nation 's finances under control			1
the @entity58 rejected the most recent @entity2 - passed anti-shutdown bill on a party - line vote of 54 - 44 friday , insisting on a straightforward continuation in government funding without health care - related add - ons			2
that left the next step up to the @entity2 - with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter			2
for a moment at least , the revised @entity2 proposal papered over a simmering dispute between speaker @entity111 and the rest of the leadership , and tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing the health law that all @entity47 lawmakers oppose			2
it was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with @entity229 sen. @entity228 , who has become the face of the ' @entity95 ' campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a fundraising tool			0
in debate on the @entity2 floor , @entity32 adamantly rejected charges that they seek a government shutdown , and said their goal is to spare the nation from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the quality of care			1
the law is an ' attack and an assault on the free enterprise and the free economy , ' said rep. @entity250 of @entity229			0
' @entity2 are shutting down the government			2
they 're doing it intentionally			0
they 're doing it on purpose , ' said rep. @entity255 of @entity256 , as @entity47 lawmakers booed from their seats on the floor			0
in the @entity58 , there was little doubt that @entity81 had the votes to block a one - year delay in the health care program widely known as ' @entity95 '			0
the device tax seemed trickier , since 33 @entity58 joined all @entity58 @entity2 in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the year			2
but aides said both @entity2 - passed proposals would be rejected in a single vote			2
the 2.3 percent tax , which took effect in january , is imposed on items such as pacemakers and ct scan machines ; eyeglasses , contact lenses , hearing aids and other items are exempt			0
repealing it would cost the government an estimated $ 29 billion over the coming decade			0
if lawmakers miss the approaching deadline , a wide range of federal programs would be affected , from the national parks to the @entity287			0
some critical services such patrolling the borders , inspecting meat and controlling air traffic would continue			0
@entity293 benefits would be sent and the @entity295 health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals			0
the new health insurance exchanges would open tuesday , a development that 's lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending bill to gut implementation of the law			0
on the vote to repeal the medical device tax , 17 @entity58 sided with @entity32			2
two @entity58 supported the delay in the health care law , and two @entity32 opposed it .			2
