reducing the amount of salt in our diets could save nearly 20,000 lives in the @entity5 every year , according to researchers			1
doctors say deaths from heart disease would fall dramatically if consumers paid attention to food labels			2
yet most @entity5 have no idea how much salt they consume or what the maximum recommended levels are			1
do n't add salt : our diets are already salt - heavy with 80 % coming from processed foods the recommended maximum daily intake for adults is 6g in the @entity5 , although just last month the @entity23 revised this down to 5g			1
yet according to figures from the @entity27 , men consume around 9.7g a day , while women have 7.7g			1
now researchers at three universities , including @entity31 , have revealed the dramatic effect reducing salt could have on death rates by using computer models			2
they estimated that reducing salt intake to 6g ( or 2,300mg of sodium ) would save 500,000 to 850,000 lives in the @entity39 over the next decade			2
' no matter how we look at it , the story is the same â€“ there will be huge benefits in reducing sodium , ' said study author dr @entity46 , from @entity47			0
the @entity5 consumer group @entity48 said reducing the @entity5 's daily intake to 6g could save around 17,500 deaths from heart attacks and strokes a year			1
if food labels only contain sodium levels , multiply this number by 2.5 to get the salt content @entity5 gp @entity56 , medical director of charity @entity58 , told @entity59 : ' @entity60 is a big problem in the @entity5 too			1
it 's a silent killer			0
over time consuming too much of it increases the risk of high blood blood pressure , which can lead to heart attacks and strokes			1
' about 80 per cent of our salt intake comes from processed foods , so it can be difficult to avoid			2
' many people are unaware of where salt is hidden , such as bread , soups , ready meals , even breakfast cereals and mayonnaise			0
' the @entity80 approach has been to encourage food manufacturers to modify the amount of salt in their products			0
there has been a reduction but it is taking too long			0
the @entity88 should consider setting mandatory maximum levels for salt			0
' @entity91 , @entity92 at the @entity27 , added : ' eating too much salt may raise your blood pressure and having high blood pressure increases your risk of developing coronary heart disease			1
' the government has worked with the food industry to reduce the amount of salt in our food and make labels clearer			0
but there is still work to be done by everyone because the majority of @entity109 are still consuming more salt than they should be			0

too much salt increases risk of high blood pressure , which can lead to heart attacks and stroke
adults should consume no more than 6g a day , but on average @entity5 men have 9.7g and women have 7.7g
