@entity0 , @entity1 team director who guided sides to three @entity4 triumphs and the world no 1 spot , will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of @entity1 cricket			1
the @entity11 gave @entity0 the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last ashes whitewash			1
this has led to speculation that @entity0 ’s continuing role on the @entity11 staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment			1
former @entity1 team director @entity0 is now technical director of elite coaching at the @entity11 but effectively @entity0 is now running the @entity1 cricket academy at @entity27 and working with young players in a coaching role , and liaising with counties			1
and it ’s understood he has no wish to get involved at @entity1 senior level again or become entangled in the politics			2
those politics have @entity36 at centre stage as ever			0
but @entity0 , having closed one chapter in his life and fully moved on to his behind - the - scenes @entity27 role , is highly unlikely to speak out about @entity36 now			2
meanwhile , @entity36 , who is using social media app @entity43 to film himself getting a sun tan or whistling , continues to dominate the pr battle against the @entity11 , who botched his axing and have totally mismanaged the fall - out since			2
@entity36 is back playing cricket for @entity50 in the hope of winning back a test spot in the @entity1 side it looks only a matter of time before @entity56 is sacked as @entity58 manager			2
and his son @entity59 , who is living in @entity1 , is n’t waiting for the axe to fall on his father , having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to @entity65			0
however , @entity59 ’s return is purely for family reasons with his wife , who has just had twins , wanting family support to look after four kids who are under the age of five			0
only the @entity11 ’s hopeless media team could launch the domestic @entity74 , which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the @entity76 and @entity77 , on the same day as an @entity1 test match			1
and only the @entity11 , having brought in former @entity4 hero @entity79 to drum up publicity for the launch , could then decide he should n’t speak to national newspapers			1
an @entity11 spokesman said the date was n’t ideal but they were constrained by the domestic and international schedule			0
and the print media snub was due to the @entity11 having limited time with @entity79			0
@entity79 ( left ) shares a joke with @entity89 and @entity1 's @entity90 at the @entity74 launch there was a player for all 18 counties present at the @entity74 launch on thursday it can cause problems in football when agents represent players and managers			0
but the @entity11 have no concerns that former county cricketer @entity102 represents both @entity103 and @entity1 head coach @entity104			2
likewise , the @entity105 say they have no problems with @entity1 manager @entity108 ’s agent being @entity109 who also looks after emerging international @entity110			0
coincidentally , @entity112 coach @entity111 is paid well enough to need the advice of @entity114 , whose stellar agency clients include the world ’s most expensive footballer @entity116			0
@entity118 ’s no messiah @entity121 ’s smooth procession to a ridiculous fifth term as @entity124 president continued at the @entity125 in the @entity126			0
such was the lack of democracy @entity121 ’s three rivals were n’t even given the opportunity to address delegates			0
one delegate , @entity132 of the @entity133 , was so sycophantic towards @entity121 he spoke of him in the same terms as @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			0
@entity140 is part of @entity143 ’s top - heavy team of cricket pundits for the @entity4 series			1
but that commitment should not prove an obstacle to him becoming director of @entity11 , a position for which he is one of the front - runners			1
@entity140 is one of the weak links in the commentary box - sir @entity153 is the other - and looks far more suited to be a @entity156 - style leader of @entity1 cricket if that ’s what the @entity11 decide they ’re looking for			1
former @entity1 captain @entity140 is a front - runner to becoming director of @entity11 such is the friendship between @entity162 chairman @entity161 and sir @entity153 , who are each building houses on @entity165 , that the new restaurant in the @entity167 that is part of the @entity168 outside @entity169 is to be called @entity153 ’s despite @entity153 having no association with @entity162 .			1

@entity0 guided @entity1 to three @entity4 wins over @entity172
former team director also led @entity1 to the world no 1 @entity177 *ranking*
@entity140 is a front - runner to becoming director of @entity11
