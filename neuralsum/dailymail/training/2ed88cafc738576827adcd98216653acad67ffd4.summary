@entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft arrived at @entity3 late sunday after a 442 million - mile journey that began nearly a year ago			1
the robotic explorer fired its brakes and successfully slipped into orbit around the red planet , officials confirmed			1
' this is such an incredible night , ' said @entity11 , @entity2 's chief for science missions			0
flight controllers in @entity22 will spend the next six weeks adjusting @entity1 's altitude and checking its science instruments			1
it will then start probing the upper atmosphere of @entity3			1
the spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit ; it 's not meant to land			1
scientists believe the @entity3 atmosphere holds clues as to how @entity34 's neighbor went from being warm and wet billions of years ago to cold and dry			1
that early wet world may have harbored microbial life , a tantalizing question yet to be answered			0
@entity2 launched @entity1 last november from @entity38 , the 10th @entity40 mission sent to orbit the red planet			1
three earlier ones failed , and until the official word came of success late sunday night , the entire team was on edge			0
' i do n't have any fingernails any more , but we 've made it , ' said @entity52 , deputy director for science at @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			0
' after six weeks , it will start probing the upper atmosphere of @entity3			1
the spacecraft will conduct its observations from orbit as it is not meant to land the spacecraft was clocking more than 10,000 mph when it hit the brakes for the so - called orbital insertion , a half - hour process			1
the world had to wait 12 minutes to learn the outcome , once it occurred , because of the lag in spacecraft signals given the 138 million miles between the two planets on sunday			0
' based on observed navigation data , congratulations , @entity1 is now in @entity3 orbit , ' came the official announcement			2
flight controllers applauded the news and shook hands ; laughter filled the previously tense - filled room			0
@entity1 joins three spacecraft already circling @entity3 , two @entity40 and one @entity83			2
and the traffic jam is n't over : @entity86 's first interplanetary probe , @entity87 , will reach @entity3 in two days and also aim for orbit			2
@entity1 's chief investigator , @entity89 of the @entity90 's @entity91 in @entity92 , hopes to learn where all the water on @entity3 went , along with the carbon dioxide that once comprised an atmosphere thick enough to hold moist clouds			2
the gases may have been stripped away by the sun early in @entity3 ' existence , escaping into the upper atmosphere and out into space			1
@entity1 's observations should be able to extrapolate back in time , @entity89 said			0
maven — short for @entity105 — will spend at least a year collecting data			0
that 's a full @entity34 year , half a @entity3 one			2
its orbit will dip as low as 78 miles above the @entity3 surface as its eight instruments make measurements			1
the craft is as long as a school bus , from solar wingtip to tip , and as hefty as an suv			0
maven will have a rare brush with a comet next month			0
the nucleus of newly discovered @entity120 will pass 82,000 miles from @entity3 on oct. 19			2
the risk of comet dust damaging @entity1 is low , officials said , and the spacecraft should be able to observe @entity120 as a science bonus			0
the explorer has travelled 442 million miles since it took off from the @entity128 last year @entity129 , @entity1 's maker , is operating the mission from its control center at @entity132 , @entity22			2
this is @entity2 's 21st shot at @entity3 and the first since the @entity134 landed on the red planet in 2012			1
just this month , @entity134 arrived at its prime science target , a mountain named @entity138 , ripe for drilling			0
the opportunity rover is also still active a decade after landing			0
all these robotic scouts are paving the way for the human explorers that @entity2 hopes to send in the 2030s			0
the space agency wants to understand as much about the red planet as possible before it sends people there .			1

robot fired its brakes and slipped into orbit around the red planet
the $ *671million* mission is the first dedicated to @entity3 ' upper atmosphere
next six weeks will be spent adjusting altitude and checking its instruments
@entity162 will conduct its checks from orbit as it is not meant to land
