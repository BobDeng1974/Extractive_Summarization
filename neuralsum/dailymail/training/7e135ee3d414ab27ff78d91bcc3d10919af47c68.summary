as showboating goes , this is about as dangerous as it gets			2
the foolish fly - bys are being performed by an @entity5 pilot at one of the @entity9 nation 's air bases in @entity10			1
in a series of show - off swoops , the reckless pilot almost knocks bystanders off their feet with his down force as he pulls out of nose dives with just metres to go			1
recipe for disaster : the aircraft is barely metres above runway while travelling at high speed with an overconfident pilot in control and an audience to impress , the series of events , which was captured on film , has all the hallmarks of a @entity42 type disaster			0
luckily for the photographers gathered , the @entity23 remains airborne just about			0
the @entity5 @entity23 were used to attack @entity45 vessels during the @entity47 conflict			0
run for cover : the admiring pack below appear to panic when the plane heads their way incoming : the @entity23 prepares for another fly past as it accelerates towards the ground closer : the pilot pushes his luck as he sees the scattering crowd below it is this type of low flying ability which shows why they were so effective in engaging floating targets			0
but in peacetime , they are used by pilots to perform these dangerous and improvised air shows			1
aviation experts have long criticised fly - bys , which serve no purpose other than entertaining crowds			1
clips of this stunt , which was posted on fan forum ' the @entity73 ' , was slammed by qualified pilots			0
one said : ' that was done , quite recklessly i might add , in order to ' woo ' and ' aww ' the crowd on the ground			0
flat hatting : the practice is frowned upon by the aviation community close : the bottom of the @entity23 , which has not deployed its landing gear appears to be almost touching the ground ' it 's called " flat - hatting " , and there are plenty of dead airmen to show why it is a foolish thing to do , something you are told you will not do from day one of flight school			1
such stunts in these conditions can be especially dangerous			2
the @entity95 , is one of the few airstrips able to function in @entity10			1
in the summer temperatures average around -1.5 degrees , while in the winter they plummet to a petrifying -15 degrees			0
@entity5 retains the base for pilot training , with the base positioned close to the southern coats of the country .			2

stunts were performed on an air base in @entity10
*technique* known as ' flat - hatting ' is frowned upon by aviation experts
