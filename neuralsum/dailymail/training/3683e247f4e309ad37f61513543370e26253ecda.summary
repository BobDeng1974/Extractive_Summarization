by @entity0 coffee lovers who want to get the best flavour from their favourite brew should gulp the drink down rather than sip it			2
scientists say taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly			1
they looked at ‘ sip volume ’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘ higher aroma release ’			1
scientists say taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly the researchers said : ‘ the findings could be useful to understand the factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of coffee			1
’ however , the advice goes against that for other drinks , such as wine , where people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the maximum flavour and aroma			1
the researchers from the @entity34 said it was well known that smell and taste are related and that one can have a significant impact on the other			0
scientists at the @entity34 in @entity41 found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken , the more fragrance was released this study , published in the journal @entity48 , studied different sipping amounts and the impact they had on the smell of coffee			1
it was found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken , the more fragrance was released			1
the researchers said the varying levels of aroma from different size sips or gulps could be explained by the amount of saliva in drinkers ’ mouths			1
they tested four different types of coffee brews - @entity65 , @entity66 , moka and espresso			2
espresso coffee - the one type of coffee usually sipped - was identified as giving off the most aroma when bigger rather than smaller sips were taken			1
earlier this year , a separate study found that coffee does n’t just perk you up – but just one mug a day can give your memory a boost too			2
researchers at the @entity82 found that a 200mg caffeine pill – equivalent to a strong mug – taken soon after a learning session improved image recall			2
the caffeine - induced improvement was not seen with smaller doses of caffeine or when it was given an hour before viewing the images			0
smoking spoils the taste of a cup of coffee – even after quitting , according to recent research			0
the strong , bitter taste of caffeine is usually easily detected , even in tiny amounts – but not for those who light up			0
it seems their ability to taste is harmed by the toxic chemicals found in tobacco			0
to find out whether taste is still affected even after people stop smoking , scientists tested how well 451 volunteers could recognise the four basic flavours of sweet , sour , bitter and salty , as well as the intensity of each taste			2
the study , published in the journal @entity115 , found that whether the volunteers smoked or not did not affect whether they could recognise salty , sweet or sour tastes – but it did have an effect on the bitter taste of caffeine			0
one in five smokers and one in four ex-smokers could not correctly recognise the taste			0
however , a mere 13 per cent of non-smokers failed the taste test			0
researchers believe the build - up of tobacco in the body could stop taste buds renewing themselves and so harm a person ’s ability to recognise certain tastes , even after they have stopped smoking .			0
