just seconds had passed after the final whistle before one thug decided to hop the barriers , charge towards @entity4 ’s victorious players and start swinging			1
the @entity6 fan threw two punches at defender @entity8 — failing to land either — before being rugby tackled to the ground by @entity11 and then escorted away by stewards			1
this east @entity14 derby is one of the most frantic rivalries in @entity18 football but the last thing it needs is idiots like this			1
the man was arrested and faces a life ban			0
@entity24 celebrates wildly after @entity26 's late winning goal as @entity4 beat rivals @entity6 2 - 1 the @entity6 fan swung a punch at @entity4 defender @entity8 , who moved out out of the way a @entity6 fan is restrained after running onto the pitch at full - time to confront @entity4 's @entity8 it was an afternoon to forget for home supporters			1
their team had surrendered a lead — anyone who has watched @entity6 this season will know that is a rarity — and lost to their worst enemy			1
defeats cut deep and the strife between the two teams continues to grow year - on - year			2
the roots of this intense rivalry are said to lie in the @entity49 when @entity50 from @entity6 invented a machine that copied hand - made lace but as soon as the patent ran out @entity55 entrepreneurs stole the idea			1
the hatred was famously stoked by @entity58			0
in 1983 , @entity58 , in his time manager of both clubs but then at @entity4 , told defender @entity61 : ‘ just do one thing for me , @entity61			1
play well in this match and i wo n’t ask another thing of you			0
’ @entity4 's @entity26 ( right ) celebrates after scoring his side 's winner in injury time @entity69 might be in disarray after the sacking of @entity72 , but @entity74 ’s charge under @entity75 continues apace after a 5 - 0 thumping			1
@entity77 , who spends his career out on loan from the @entity81 - owned @entity80 , scored twice , with @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 also finding the net			2
the @entity86 are in the top six , winning five of their last seven @entity89 games			0
but @entity4 lost 2 - 0 — against a team led by @entity58 ’s old ally @entity91 , no less — and the manager lost it in the dressing room			1
derby players had been pelted with coins and bottles by fans that day and running battles broke out near the train station			2
situations are more controlled now but for @entity4 manager @entity24 this fixture takes on added importance , much in the same way as it did for @entity58			1
@entity24 is the man who says he is ‘ entrenched ’ in @entity55 and in 1989 claimed he ’d rather sign on the dole than play for @entity6			1
‘ no disrespect but i could never work for that club in any capacity			0
’ @entity24 celebrates as @entity108 equalises for @entity4 in the second - half @entity108 celebrates after equalising for @entity4 after 74 minutes he was rather more dignified at the @entity111 on saturday after seeing his players fight his corner after an impassioned speech in the hotel beforehand			1
‘ you ’ve either got to play for me to hear a team talk or you ’ve got to pay a lot of money to come and listen to me at a leadership conference ! ’ he smirked when asked to reveal what he said			0
‘ otherwise i ’m not telling you			0
’ @entity24 might have been telling us the reasons for parting with @entity4 had he not conjured a response from his players			1
they ’d won just twice since september and were continuing to stagnate with no signs of revival			0
after securing a late winner , for once @entity24 did n’t need to go firefighting			1
@entity24 was under intense pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table ‘ in some ways we might have to build and emulate @entity6 , ’ he said			1
‘ they are an outstanding side , built over five years , from @entity138 ’s days			0
@entity140 ( @entity139 ) has taken the team on and they are a very good side			0
they have a fantastic set - up at this club			2
’ forest owner @entity145 found his tyres had been let down and a number plate ripped off his car afterwards			0
‘ i do n’t mind at all			0
the three points are more important , ’ was his response , though @entity4 may seek compensation for the damage			2
there was nothing deflating about the visitors , though , who showed they may have the guts to match their manager ’s style			2
@entity24 chose not to celebrate afterwards , adding : ‘ i just go inside myself , enjoy the moment , then look to go and win a game on wednesday			2
i do n’t drink , i gave up 11 years ago			0
’ he could have done with a stiff one after hauling himself from the brink			0
@entity6 could count themselves lucky they were not behind early on			2
with the score at 0 - 0 , @entity164 pulled @entity166 to the ground with a tackle more suited to the rugby field , but the referee gave nothing			2
what 's caught my eye ... @entity174 suffered the misfortune of losing first - choice goalkeeper @entity177 to a broken arm in their 2 - 0 defeat against @entity181 , only to find substitute @entity182 suffer the exact same fate before half - time			1
defender @entity185 ended up in goal for 48 minutes and @entity181 only scored their second late on			0
@entity188 have finally won a game			0
their last victory came on december 13 but a winner from @entity193 , on his debut , saw @entity196 ’s side record an impressive win against @entity198			0
chant of the weekend has to go to the @entity201 fans at @entity202			0
the hosts were mocked for their fishing heritage , with @entity206 supporters singing : ‘ pies are sustainable			0
’ it got worse for @entity210 ’s @entity209 , who lost 2 - 0 and are in danger of falling away in mid-table			1
@entity174 defender @entity185 ended up in goal for 48 minutes during the 2 - 0 defeat against @entity181			1

@entity4 beat @entity6 2 - 1 in the @entity14 derby
@entity26 *rattled* home the winner in stoppage time
the result eases the pressure on @entity4 manager @entity24
