the chairman of a powerful committee in @entity2 is demanding access ' without delay ' to a key witness in the @entity7 email saga that has engulfed the @entity8 , but the @entity9 insists she ca n't testify until after the midterm congressional elections			1
@entity12 chairman @entity11 , a @entity14 @entity13 , demanded late wednesday in a letter to treasury secretary @entity16 that he must make @entity9 counsel @entity17 available before that nov. 4 political milestone date			1
@entity17 was the first @entity9 aide to learn that the @entity8 was unable to locate two years ' worth of disgraced official @entity7 's emails because of a hard drive crash			1
her former private law practice colleague @entity24 told her in april , according to reports of closed - door testimony @entity27 gave the @entity28			1
that disclosure , @entity27 reportedly told the committee , led to the @entity31 finding out about the email losses two months before @entity2 was notified			2
@entity57 has sought @entity17 's testimony since mid-september , he wrote , but @entity59 has stonewalled him and ignored his requests			2
' @entity9 officials ignored this committee 's phone and email inquiries about ms. @entity66 's availability , ' @entity11 wrote to @entity16			0
' on the morning of october 14 , a month from the initial request , the same @entity9 officials told staff that ms. @entity66 was not available until sometime in november			2
' @entity11 added that @entity9 insisted interviewing a @entity9 lawyer would introduce ' constitutional and practical concerns ' – even though @entity12 has already questioned more than a dozen of them			1
' why the sudden change in protocol ? ' he asked			0
his demands include a list of everyone at @entity9 who learned about the email problems before @entity2 was notified			2
he also wants to know who told the @entity31 , which @entity31 officials were informed , and when			0
' your office is now refusing to make available until after the election the very person that could unlock that mystery			0
this is completely unacceptable , especially for an administration that once pledged to be the most open and transparent ever			0
' hot seat : treasury secretary @entity16 's agency wants to hold off providing @entity92 for testimony until after the midterm elections , when more bad news could hurt @entity95 ' already waning hope of gaining seats in @entity2 the scandal broke wide open in may 2013 when @entity7 , then director of the @entity100 , answered a planted question during a tax lawyers ' conference about how her agency decided which nonprofit groups to scrutinize carefully			1
@entity7 knew what @entity2 did not : that an internal inspector general report on the matter would be issued soon , thrusting it into the public spotlight			0
republicans howled at the admission that organizations were selected for intrusive questions and long delays based on words like ' patriots ' and ' tea party ' in their names			0
days later , president @entity120 accepted the resignation of the acting @entity8 commissioner and promised in a statement from the @entity31 that his administration would ' work with @entity2 as it performs its oversight role ' and work ' hand in hand with @entity2 to get this thing fixed			1
' many of the @entity7 emails sought by @entity2 have been recovered by searching the archives of other @entity8 employees who sent or received them			1
but countless more , including any between @entity7 and officials at the @entity31 or other agencies , are likely gone for good			0
@entity8 commissioner @entity135 has testified repeatedly on @entity136 that his employees did everything possible to recover data from @entity7 's hard drive , including sending it to forensic experts at the @entity143			1
ultimately , he has said , no data was recoverable – and the hard drive was destroyed by a recycling contractor			0
congressional republicans including @entity57 are skeptical since the time period covered by the email losses overlaps with the months when the @entity8 has already conceded it was targeting right - wing tax - exemption applicants			2

@entity12 chairman *angrily* demanded that treasury secretary make lawyer @entity92 available next week
@entity17 was the first @entity9 aide who learned from the @entity8 about disgraced former official @entity7 's now - *famous* ' lost ' emails
she was told by her friend @entity24 , an @entity8 lawyer she had worked with in private law practice
@entity2 never learned about the emails , or the *computer* crash that destroyed them , until two months later
now the @entity120 @entity9 has stonewalled @entity2 , republicans say , refusing to let @entity17 testify until next month
