@entity0 and other internet giants came under fierce attack from @entity3 yesterday for ‘ effectively denying responsibility ’ for vile online images			1
the prime minister , unveiling measures to try to limit the impact of online porn , said watching hardcore material was ‘ in danger of becoming a rite of passage ’ for @entity14 ’s youngsters			2
‘ our children are growing up too fast , ’ he said , confirming plans revealed in yesterday ’s @entity16 for all 19million households connected to the internet to be forced to say whether or not they want to continue having access to legal adult material			1
blacklist : @entity3 warned search engines like @entity0 and @entity26 they have a ' moral duty ' to act against banned search terms on illegal child porn , mr @entity3 said the way internet search engines behaved was the equivalent of the @entity33 ‘ helping someone identify and order illegal material ... and then sending it on to them ’			1
in such circumstances ‘ they would absolutely be held responsible for their actions ’			0
demanding that search engines ‘ step up to the plate ’ , the prime minister said : ‘ we need a situation where you can not have people searching for child abuse images and being aided in doing so			1
’ mr @entity3 said web firms should block all searches that include words on a blacklist being drawn up by watchdogs and ensure warning signs flash up telling internet users that material they are trying to access is against the law			1
he threatened legislation unless there is significant progress by october			0
‘ if people enter into a @entity0 search a truly disgusting term , something that ’s so obvious that the searcher is looking for illegal child abuse images , my view – and i think the view of parents up and down the country – is that the internet company should n’t return any results , ’ he said			1
‘ at the moment they ’re saying they should			0
they ’re saying it ’s a matter of free speech			0
i ’m saying look , it is n’t about free speech , these images are illegal , you should n’t enable people who are deliberately searching for them			2
’ in a speech at the @entity88 in @entity89 , mr @entity3 said family - friendly filters would be automatically selected by providers for all new broadband customers by the end of the year – although they will be able to choose to switch them off			1
millions of existing computer users will be contacted by the end of next year and told they must decide whether or not to use ‘ family - friendly filters ’ to restrict adult material			1
the filters will apply to all devices linked to a home @entity100			2
victory for the mail : prime minister @entity3 , pictured today , today announced new rules requiring every internet connection to have porn blocked unless subscribers ' opt in ' to obscene content customers who do not click on either option – accepting or declining – will have filters activated by default			1
asked if the opt - in system would mean a husband having to confess to his partner if he wanted to look at porn , mr @entity3 told @entity117 : ‘ if an adult wants to get rid of the filter on their computer , that ’s up to them			1
’ pressed on the issue , the prime minister eventually conceded : ‘ yes , it does			0
’ he said he would be installing internet filters in his own home , adding : ‘ you ’re always a few clicks away from something you should n’t see			2
’ a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery			1
we use our own systems and work with child safety experts to find it , remove and report it			2
' we recently donated $ 5m ( £ 3.3m ) to groups working to combat this problem and are committed to continuing the dialogue with the government on these issues			0
’ @entity145 , chief executive of @entity146 , said : ‘ we take our responsibility very seriously and that is why we are now contacting our existing customers to ask them if they want to use [ family - friendly filter ] @entity151 , and we will be pre-ticking @entity151 as on for new customers from the end of the year			1
‘ one in three customers are choosing to turn on parental controls when offered the chance			2
’ but @entity157 of the @entity158 warned : ‘ sites about sexual health , about sexuality and so on , will get caught up in the same filters as pornography			0
it will really restrict people ’s experience on the web , including children ’s			0
’ by @entity168 , education reporter @entity169 : child porn photos teachers caught with images of child abuse will be banned automatically from classrooms , the @entity171 says			1
previously , some school staff found to have child porn were allowed to continue working			0
the new guidance says ‘ any criminal conviction or caution that involves indecent images of children ’ should lead to an indefinite ban			0
any sexual misconduct , not just ‘ serious sexual misconduct ’ , should trigger a ban , it says			0
this would include behaviour that is not illegal but does bring the teacher ’s conduct into question			0
the new rules follow the revelation last month that religious education teacher @entity169 was given the go - ahead to pursue his career despite being found to have downloaded almost 200 photos of child porn			1
@entity169 , 36 , was suspended from from @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 , in december 2010 after his arrest			0
he accepted a police caution and was dismissed by the school			0
but a professional conduct panel said he should be allowed to apply for work in other schools as he ‘ does not represent a risk to children ’			0
paedophile @entity210 , 33 , from @entity211 , @entity212 , who amassed the largest collection of child porn images ever seized in @entity14 – more than 3.5million – was jailed for seven years yesterday at @entity216 .			2

@entity3 said family - friendly filters would be automatically selected for new broadband customers by the end of the year
@entity3 said search engines should *n't* give any results when child abuse images are looked up
plans will mean 19 million households will have to say whether or not they want access to adult material
