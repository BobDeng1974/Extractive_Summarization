he is still going after all these years and is the longest - serving worker back then : this archive picture shows the newly developed site one week before it opened in april 1963 pretty as a picture : this is another view of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , showing how its creators wanted to distil the essence of @entity64 life in miniature form @entity66 : visitors snake their way into @entity8 , which has become one of @entity10 's most popular attractions the first model he made in 1963 was a model railway track			1
