by @entity0 @entity1 tried to steer @entity2 away from the rocks even as the @entity6 manager ’s doomed reign entered its final throes			1
@entity1 , @entity6 's interim boss following @entity2 's sacking on tuesday , became an increasingly peripheral figure in the @entity11 's backroom team and felt that his promotion to player - coach last summer was little more than a pr exercise to please supporters			1
but it did not stop the @entity18 veteran making a personal plea to his former manager to show leniency to @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 after they were photographed partying into the early hours in @entity26 following @entity6 ’s @entity28 defeat by @entity29			2
parted company : @entity1 ( left ) with the now sacked @entity2 during their time together at @entity6 punished : @entity23 ( centre ) was one of three players pictured out on the town at 3.20am @entity2 punished his three @entity36 internationals with a fine and ordered them to do extra training at @entity39 last week			2
@entity1 agreed that his team - mates were unwise to be out on the town so soon after high - profile defeat , but argued that they had not broken any specific rules			0
he also suggested that @entity2 would not have taken such a hardline stance with some of the more senior members of his squad			0
@entity1 knew that the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the @entity6 players , not just the three who were punished , and tried to convince @entity2 that it was the wrong thing to do			1
his plea went unheeded although it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now he has been put in temporary charge			0
the issue was indicative of the way in which @entity2 lost the support of his squad over time			0
it was significant that the @entity11 did not mention them in a statement on wednesday , and there has been a notable silence from the players on social media since he left the club			0
glum : @entity23 leaves a @entity6 training session at @entity39 following @entity2 's sacking smiling again : @entity1 behind the wheel on the day he took over from @entity2 as temporary boss			1

@entity1 became a peripheral figure towards end of @entity2 's reign
he pleaded with @entity2 to be lenient with @entity24 , @entity23 and @entity22
@entity1 argued trio had not broken any rules , to no avail
disciplinary action went down badly with many @entity6 players
*incident* shows how @entity2 lost the dressing room towards the end
