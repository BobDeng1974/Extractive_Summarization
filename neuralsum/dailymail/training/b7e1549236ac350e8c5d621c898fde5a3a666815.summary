challenge : @entity2 said @entity3 had to agree to the tv debates so voters can make a choice about who they want to be prime minister many senior @entity17 blame the debates in 2010 for mr @entity3 's failure to secure an outright majority			1
he performed badly in the first encounter , while @entity16 leader @entity28 benefited from being comparatively unknown			2
conservative strategists feared mr @entity13 could enjoy a similar boost in the polls if he was given a platform in the debates			2
but mr @entity2 made clear it should be a straight battle between the three main party leaders			0
speaking during a q&a session at the @entity7 conference , mr @entity2 said : ' it is time for @entity3 to stop ducking and diving to agree to the tv debates just like the last general election , so the country can make its choice			1
' in 2010 each main broadcaster hosted a debate , including @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
rerun : mr @entity2 wants the same format seen in 2010 , with the @entity52 , @entity16 and @entity7 leaders going head - to - head mr @entity28 enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside mr @entity3 and @entity60			1
until recently @entity7 had hoped to capitalise on the rise of @entity14 , hoping it would split the centre - right vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats			2
but recent polls suggest @entity14 has taken support from all the main parties			2
mr @entity13 has said he is prepared to take legal action to get into televised leaders ’ debates if mr @entity3 tries to freeze him out			1
challenge : @entity14 leader @entity13 has threatened to go to court to secure a place on a leaders ' tv debate the prime minister has publicly expressed concern that the three debates ' sucked the life ' out of the last campaign			1
he has called for future debates to take place in the months before the may 2015 vote , rather than in the final weeks - a plan that has been privately ridiculed by broadcasters			2
' i think tv debates are good			0
i enjoyed them last time - particularly the last one			0
we have a fixed - term @entity91 now , so we can think about it in a slightly different way , ' he said in december			0
' i have n’t made my mind up exactly what we should do			0
my reflection on last time was that they did take all the life out of the campaign			2
' the press and all of us were interested in the run - up to the debate , the debate and the post-debate analysis , not the rest of the campaign , which i really enjoy			0
' i like campaigning , i like being out there , the public meetings , the awkward moments , the difficulties			0
' it is an incredibly exciting time , trying to explain what you are about and what you are trying to do			0
i found the tv debates took all the life out of it			2
' @entity120 signalled that mr @entity3 would agree to the debates , but again questioned the format			1

' a @entity131 spokesman added : ' as for what format they will take , they are still quite a long way off and it is yet to be discussed			0
' former @entity52 spin doctor @entity137 has warned that the @entity17 should not pull out , using an article in @entity139 to tell mr @entity3 : ' do n't be chicken '			1
he argued that mr @entity3 actually won two of the three debates last time			1
' they sealed the deal on the question of him being seen as @entity147 material			0
