@entity1 ’s @entity0 the defenders have been a bag of nerves			1
that comes from the pressure of playing for @entity1 and their run of bad results			1
last season @entity9 was caught up in a number of mishaps — this from a good defender , one of @entity15 ’s invincibles , but he was misunderstood			1
@entity1 wanted a vocal leader where @entity9 leads through performances			1
now he has fought back and is playing like the player we expected			0
@entity21 should take a leaf out of his book			0
@entity21 was excellent for @entity24 but looks a different player in @entity1 red			1
he was signed to answer their defensive prayers but there was no quick fix , it is all about the group			0
@entity33 needs to work hard now to restore his confidence			1
the central issue @entity1 are not the only team guilty of this , but too often their full backs do n’t tuck in and the centre backs do n’t pick up in the box			1
there are wild clearances and mistimed headers which makes me wonder how often defenders actually practise these things			2
goalkeepers spend all week punching and taking crosses — defenders should too			2
we can be too protective of them when really they need full - blooded training			0
that way in a match situation you can be confident of clearing your lines			0
@entity33 needs to bring a confidence back to his @entity1 side and sort out his defence the @entity61 manager needs to select his best xi - last year he had consistency in the team he put out @entity1 have managed to reach the semi final of the @entity65 after beating @entity66 in midweek selection headaches one of @entity33 ’s biggest issues has been picking his best xi. last season you knew his team would be the same for every game			1
this time there has been too much change			0
that creates confusion and makes it hard to build confidence			2
it ’s time for @entity33 to back his players and trust the ones he believes in			1
arsenal are losing touch a feature of the goals conceded by @entity15 this season is allowing opposition players too much freedom in the box			1
defending is all about partnerships and on occasions per @entity92 has been too detached from his fellow centre backs			0
when crosses are put in defenders need to be touch tight with the attackers			2
not grappling all over them , but aware of their position and within reach so they can put in a block or a tackle			0
@entity15 have been too loose with that this season			1
@entity15 have given away too much space and @entity92 ( left ) has been detached from fellow defenders @entity108 , who has been a big miss for @entity15 this season , visits children at the @entity112 @entity113 ( left ) despairs as @entity15 concede two late goals and lose to @entity115 in november the missing man the absence of @entity108 has been a big blow for @entity15			1
over the past two or three years he has grown into one of the best all - round defenders in the league			2
his mobility is his biggest asset and @entity15 have missed his pace			2
he seeks out danger and snuffs it out			0
@entity126 to keep clean sheets , you have to remain focused at all times			0
even if the opposition have a throw , you have to deny them space and make sure their wingers do n’t get the ball in to feet			0
at @entity115 , @entity137 was allowed to receive the ball to feet and @entity140 had little protection in front of him			0
it ’s all about communication between the full back and the midfield to squeeze the space and make sure nobody switches off , even for a second .			0

@entity33 need to restore confidence in his @entity1 side
the @entity61 boss does **n't** know his best xi like he did last year
@entity15 ***'s*** defenders are **n't** getting close enough to the opposition
@entity108 ***'s*** absence has been a big loss for @entity161
the @entity164 ***'s*** side have been switching off before the game is won
