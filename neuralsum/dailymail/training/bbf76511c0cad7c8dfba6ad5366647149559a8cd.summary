football fans will have their voice heard in every boardroom in the country , if plans unveiled by @entity5 on friday are approved			1
@entity5 hope this will stop the wishes of fans being ignored when decisions are made concerning their clubs , as has been seen in recent years at @entity11 and @entity12			1
the @entity15 side 's owner @entity13 changed the colour of @entity11 's home shirts from blue to red in 2012 despite strong opposition from supporters , while @entity12 became @entity12 in 2013 , removing ' @entity21 ' which had been part of the name since its formation in 1904			1
@entity11 owner @entity13 changed the club 's home shirt from blue to red to appeal to audiences abroad meanwhile , in 2013 , @entity12 owner @entity30 changed the club 's name to include @entity12 after @entity12 @entity5 argue despite the commercial explosion of @entity36 and @entity15 football , there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run or to protect their long - term interests			1
they say this lack of accountability has led to : supporters ’ interests and identity being ignored : from clubs being relocated away from fan - bases ( @entity48 ) to team colours and names being changed to satisfy traditions on the other side of the globe ( @entity11 , @entity12 ) debt and insolvency : which have seen football clubs ( @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ) forced into administration			1
36 football league clubs ( exactly half the total number of members ) have gone into administration since 1992 unsustainably high ticket prices : despite record turnover , average ticket prices in @entity36 and @entity15 remain amongst the highest in @entity69 - only this week , the @entity64 ’s price of football survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011 @entity74 mp , @entity5 's shadow sports minister , will launch the proposals , which have been drawn up in consultation with 95 football supporters ' organisations , and would require supporters to come together to form a single accredited trust			1
in return they would have the right to appoint directors to the board of their clubs and the option to buy up to 10 per cent of shares if their club changes ownership			1
' too often fans are treated like an after - thought as ticket prices are hiked - up , grounds re-located and clubs burdened with debt or the threat of bankruptcy , ' said @entity74			1
' only this week , the @entity64 @entity100 survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011			0
we have reached a tipping point in the way football is run			0
' the @entity5 has listened to the views of fans about changing the way football is run in @entity36 and @entity15			2
and we want to ensure they are heard by the owners of the clubs too			2
' we will now consult further on proposals to enshrine on the statute books the idea that football have a special place in people 's hearts – and should be the heart of our communities			0
' football fans up and down the country continue to be squeezed as ticket prices rise above the rate of inflation @entity125 topped the list for the most expensive matchday ticket at £ 97 and dearest season ticket at £ 2,013 @entity129 mp , head of @entity5 ’s @entity130 , added : ' the @entity131 is a huge success			2
but football is more than a business			0
football clubs are part of people ’s identity and sense of belonging			0
our plan is to give fans a stake in their clubs			0
' ' @entity5 believes in sharing power and responsibility with people , and giving football fans a voice is part of our plan to change our country by devolving power to our cities , towns and communities			2
we believe in a society that gives power to people			0
' cheapest season ticket in @entity131 £ 299 at @entity159 cheapest matchday ticket in @entity131 £ 15 at @entity161 most expensive programme in @entity131 £ 4 at @entity163 most expensive pie in @entity131 £ 4 at @entity159 , @entity165 and @entity163 cheapest pie in the @entity131 £ 2.50 at @entity167 and @entity168 most expensive cup of tea in @entity131 £ 2.50 at @entity171 , @entity163 and @entity172 cheapest cup of tea in @entity131 £ 1.80 at @entity159 and @entity167 most expensive replica shirt in @entity131 £ 55 – @entity171 and @entity159 most expensive kids replica shirt in @entity131 £ 42 – @entity171			0

@entity74 mp , @entity5 's shadow sports minister , is leading the proposal
he wants fans to have a say on how their teams are run by being part of the board and having the chance to buy a *significant* share in the clubs
@entity74 *highlights* @entity11 and @entity12 as *examples* of where owners have disregarded the opinions of the fans when making big decisions
@entity5 argue fans *deserve* a chance to have their say on club matters
