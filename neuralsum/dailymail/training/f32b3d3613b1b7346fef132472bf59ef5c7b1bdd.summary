by @entity0 in x-men , @entity1 plays @entity3 , a mutant with claws that fly from the back of his hands and a skeleton coated in super-strength adamantium			0
inspired by this , a plumber from @entity12 has created a pair of @entity3 - inspired claws complete with 12 - inch stainless steel blades			1
not only do they automatically extend and retract , like @entity1 ’s claws in the film , they are so sharp they have been used to slice watermelon and rip card from a distance			1
each claw consists of three blades made from 2mm - thick stainless steel @entity27 began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades			1
these blades were attached to metal mounts that are fitted to his arms , and a plate mounted to his hands			2
attached to the end of each blade are valves , wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack			1
when wearing the @entity3 system , @entity27 can press a button to fire air from the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward			1
a spring - loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing			2
the claws were built by @entity56 star @entity27 , who has previously built a turbojet engine , vacuum shoes and hacked a mobility scooter			1
@entity27 began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades			1
these blades were then attached to metal mounts , fitted to his arms , and a plate around his hand			1
attached to the end of each blade are valves , wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack			1
when wearing the @entity3 system , @entity27 can press a switch to fire air from the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward			1
a spring - loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing			2
to make the @entity3 system , @entity27 tried a number of different methods to propel the blades forward including motorised rigs , before settling on the air tank			1
@entity27 's claws were inspired by @entity86 character @entity3 , played by @entity1 , pictured			2
in the film , @entity3 , also known as @entity87 , is a mutant with bone claws that fire from his hands			0
during an experiment , his skeleton , including these claws , are coated in super-strength , fictitious adamantium he also paid particularly close attention to the way in which the claws appeared			0
in the films , the blades are slim and discreet , and are designed to extend to different lengths			0
@entity27 said : ‘ the blade spread was a must as parallel blades would just look wrong			2
' if i was n't bothered about this i could have made the blades thicker and stronger , but they would look rubbish , so 2mm stainless steel had just the right amount of flex but still enough strength not to fold on impact			1
‘ when the claws are retracted they compress together into their housing , which is what you can hear when they ’re firing out			0
’ these blades are wired to an air tank fitted to a backpack			1
they are controlled by firing switches on the plate mounted to @entity27 's hands and extend and retract at the press of a button , pictured @entity27 began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades , pictured left			1
these blades were attached to metal mounts fitted to his arms , and a plate mounted to his hands			2
attached to the end of each blade are valves , pictured right , wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack he added that he is pleased with discreet firing switches , but said that the system could be improved if the plate was n’t mounted to the top of his hand			1
‘ but without this the whole device would move around your forearm and then you have blades firing in odd directions and possibly into the back off my hand , so it shall stay ’ , continued @entity27			1
addressing the bulky backpack , @entity27 added : ‘ the main downer to this system is really the air tank and valves you need to carry to operate them , which means you have a rucksack on all the time			1
to make the @entity3 system , @entity27 tried a number of different methods to propel the blades , pictured , forward including motorised rigs , before settling on the air tank ' but the pros outweigh the cons as it works every time , costs nothing to recharge and can increase the speed by charging with greater pressure			1
‘ the system is just a few basic slots and holes drilled between plates so when clamped or welded together form an internal pathway			0
the project took about two weeks to complete and @entity27 has posted a video explaining the design and build process on his @entity56 channel			2
@entity27 also paid close attention to the way in which the claws , pictured , appeared			2
in the films , the blades are slim and discreet			0
@entity27 said : ' the spread was a must as parallel blades would look wrong			2
i could have made the blades thicker and stronger but 2mm stainless steel had the right amount of flex but enough strength ' speaking to the @entity195 , @entity27 said : ' i 've been meaning to build some of these for a while as i 've seen some pretty rubbish attempts and thought i could do way better , and with the new film jogging my memory there 's no better time			1
' as of yet i 've not caught myself but there have been a few near misses , there not mega sharp though as these are for show not for fighting anti-mutant people			0
' the only thing i 'd improve is a smaller air tank as wolverine is not known for wearing a rucksack but i could be holiday wolverine ! ' @entity215 author and frontier scientist @entity213 has compiled a list of four psychic powers seen in the @entity86 movies that he claims ' even an inventive teenager might be able to crack and join the ranks of the world 's billionaires '			2
@entity224 @entity225 of the x-men can levitate and cause motion in both metallic and nonmetallic objects at will , the latter using the principle of diamagnetism			0
products are already on the market , including toys , that simulate a telekinesis - like effect , but they rely on brain - computer interface technology			0
according to @entity213 : ' if you can successfully and repeatedly demonstrate an act of telekinesis – that is , make an object move with just the power of your mind – and supply learning instructions so that others can do it , the value would be $ 100 billion in @entity250 dollars , provided you do n't mind selling your breakthrough knowledge to the government			0
' telepathy dark intentions aside , it could be useful and a valuable talent , with appropriate legal authorisation , to read someone 's mind or transfer a thought or emotion to someone 's consciousness the way that @entity265 , wealthy leader of the x-men does it , explained @entity213			0
secrets hidden in the mind of a terrorist or kidnapper could be obtained quickly to save lives , while victims trapped in rubble could be located by their thoughts alone and mentally sent a reassuring message that help is on the way			0
accelerated healing @entity3 's body has the ability to heal bullet wounds fast without the slightest trace of scars			0
in the real world , bodies are in a constant state of gradual regeneration , but if we suffer too great a physical injury or too many smaller injuries , present human physiology can not handle the increased workload			0
some animals can regenerate entire severed limbs or tails			0
scientists have been researching how to adapt those abilities for human use , but it is difficult transferring genetic traits from one species to another			0
scientists have also been researching ways for human cells to undergo changes so that they can be used for other purposes in the body in processes called dedifferentiation , transdifferentiation and reprogramming			0
consciousness time travel in x-men : @entity315 , @entity314 uses her phasing powers to send the consciousness of @entity3 back in time to his 1973 body			0
people would not need to achieve physical time travel to become wealthy , noted @entity213 : ' sending a numerical thought message to yourself one to two hours in the past would enable you to unscrupulously win the @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 and @entity328 , at least until new laws were passed to prevent such an unfair advantage			0

the 12 - inch metal claws were built by 32 - year - old plumber @entity27
each claw is made from 2mm - thick stainless steel wired to an air tank
this tank is fitted to a backpack and controlled by a switch on the hand
despite this system , @entity27 can wear the backpack under a suit *jacket*
the blades are so sharp they can rip through card and a watermelon
