by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:51 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 14:47 est , 4 march 2014 much of president @entity4 's 2015 budget proposal wo n't get through the @entity6 - controlled @entity5 , but the @entity7 has unveiled it anyway – a liberal @entity10 wish list of policies , many of which the @entity6 has already nixed or refused to take up			1
the @entity7 said tuesday that the president 's budget , all $ 3.901 trillion of it , would fully fund @entity16 , raise the national minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour and index it to inflation , vastly expand infrastructure - repair plans that benefit labor unions , and significantly reduces the size of the @entity1 standing army			1
@entity7 @entity6 will object to these and other measures , but the @entity27 - controlled @entity26 has the first hearings on the budget , scheduled for wednesday morning			1
@entity31 director @entity30 will testify			0
the budget blueprint claims that $ 402 billion in savings related to the @entity16 will offset new spending			0
that number is based on last year 's budget , which called deep cuts to @entity38 , trimming more than $ 300 billion from provider payments and another $ 50 billion from senior citizens			1
@entity4 presented his budget during a photo - op at a @entity46 school , emphasizing education initiatives that were largely lost in the static about larger spending numbers			2
the budget proposal ' would hollow out our defense capabilities			0
and it would do nothing to preserve or strengthen our entitlements , ' @entity54 chairman @entity6 , a @entity71 @entity6 , said in a statement			1
@entity4 's budget restores cuts in @entity78 payments that he offered republicans just a few months ago as an enticement to reaching the eventual budget deal in december			1
' the president has just three years left in his administration , and yet he seems determined to do nothing about our fiscal challenges , ' said @entity6			0
' this budget is n’t a serious document ; it ’s a campaign brochure			2
' ' it would demand that families pay more so @entity46 can spend more , ' he added			0
but the details reveal a proposal that will cut the tax burdens of some families – with a $ 60 billion expansion of the poverty - fighting @entity97 , for instance – while hiking costs for the wealthy and big corporations that create jobs			2
@entity4 played with schoolchildren after addressing an ambitious $ 3.9 trillion budget proposal and the president wants to spend an additional $ 56 billion for new stimulus projects and $ 302 billion on infrastructure repairs over four years – pleasing labor unions , a major @entity10 constituency			1
@entity6 and @entity7 @entity6 are expected to release their own budget proposal in april , starting the inevitable back - and - forth sniping that will likely culminate in a fiscal showdown just before the november midterm elections			2
@entity71 @entity6 rep. @entity6 , the @entity6 's vice presidential candidate in 2012 , has emerged as the budget negotiator for speaker @entity115 , but some tea party - aligned members of @entity119 fear that he will give too much away to the @entity27 - controlled @entity26 @entity6 are ' counting on building the tension up to a breaking point , ' a @entity6 election strategist in @entity121 told @entity124 on tuesday			1
' they 're betting that jobs , the economy and @entity16 will look so bad by november that the @entity127 will do just about anything to save their own skins			0
' the @entity6 needs to capture just six seats in the @entity26 this year in order to retake the majority and control both houses of @entity119			0
vulnerable @entity10 incumbents in at least five states have said they do n't intend to campaign for re-election with president @entity4 by their side			0
@entity4 's proposal , rep. @entity6 's office said , would add $ 8.3 trillion to the national debt in the long - term and raise $ 1.8 trillion in new tax revenue			1
that includes the so - called ' @entity146 ' tax which @entity4 has championed			2
that measure , according to the @entity7 , would ' require that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of income – after charitable contributions ' in federal income taxes			0
another hit to the wealthiest @entity1 will come in the elimination of a specialized ' carried interest ' provision in the federal tax code			0
that item allows private fund managers on @entity159 to cut their income tax rates for most of what they earn			0
@entity163 , a tea party - backed conservative group , said @entity4 's budget proposal is ' not a serious attempt to solve our nation ’s fiscal problems			1
' @entity170 , the group 's president , added that ' once again , president @entity4 has produced a budget that does n’t balance , runs annual deficits , and relies on partisan politics , instead of a fiscally responsible , pro-growth tax policy			2

wish list is likely dead - on - arrival in the @entity6 - controlled @entity5
it would *formalize* a national minimum wage hike while *enforcing* the ' @entity146 ' that sets minimum *actual* income tax levels for millionaires
@entity4 has eliminated cuts to @entity78 that he promised as part of last year 's budget negotiation
he also wants more than $ 300 billion in infrastructure *improvements* , helping labor unions in an election year
@entity6 , the @entity54 chairman , *slammed* the @entity7 budget , saying it 's a ' campaign brochure , ' not a *practical* list
