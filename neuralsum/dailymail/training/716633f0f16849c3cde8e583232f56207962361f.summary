international embassies across @entity1 are worth a staggering £ 4 billion between them , according to a new study			1
the 140 properties across the city range from the @entity8 's new £ 600million purpose built fortress in south @entity1 to the £ 750,000 suburban semi in @entity10 , west @entity1 used by @entity11			1
the research found eight embassies are estimated to be worth £ 100million or more , with most located in some of @entity1 's most expensive postcodes in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
the brand new @entity8 embassy at @entity19 in south west @entity1			1
the purpose - built fortress has been valued at £ 600million and replaces @entity21 , which sold for £ 500million the study also reveals that if the tiny @entity24 island nation of @entity25 - halfway between @entity26 and @entity27 - was to sell off its @entity1 consulate in @entity29 , south west @entity1 , it would pay off 11 per cent of its national debt of £ 6.6million			1
in addition the figures show that @entity36 's embassy near @entity37 in @entity16 , currently home to international fugitive @entity34 is valued at £ 15million but would increase in value if the @entity40 founder finally left			2
foreign embassies in the @entity42 are exempt from certain taxes such as council tax and stamp duty if the buildings are sold as non-residential properties			0
the research also found that if all the embassy buildings were to be sold , the total amount the @entity49 would lose out on in stamp duty would be £ 279.3 million			2
the research comes amid figures released last week by the @entity55 show house prices in @entity1 have risen by more than 20 per cent in the past year			2
financial publication @entity57 asked property buying agents @entity60 to value the capital 's embassies			1
@entity64 , from the magazine , said : ' i would say four billion pounds is a conservative estimate - @entity1 's embassies are probably worth more than that			1
' it 's a huge amount of money			0
the @entity73 embassy , for example , is easily worth more than £ 100 million			2
that is an astonishing value			0
and almost none of these embassies are for sale			0
the @entity36 embassy in @entity16 , central @entity1 near to @entity37 has been valued at £ 15million			1
but researchers say it would be worth a lot more if @entity40 founder @entity34 were to leave the building where he is currently living ' they paid quite a lot of money for them years ago , but they 've increased in value			0
' it also comes down to the fact that some of these countries used to have a lot more money			0
' however , when they do go for sale they can go very quickly			0
' others are listed buildings which means its very hard to do things with them			0
maybe in some cases that depresses the sale value slightly			0
' one of the things we looked at was whether countries could afford their own embassies			0
' @entity25 , for example , could n't - its embassy is valued at over 10 per cent of its national debt			2
' @entity113 , home to the @entity27 embassy on the @entity115 in central @entity1 , is worth at least £ 100million			1
new research has found that all 140 of @entity1 's embassies are worth a combined £ 4billion asked about the shabby @entity119 , he said : ' it 's used for national pride			1
@entity11 are n't interested in glamour			0
' they 're supposed to be a socialist state that emphasises utilitarianism , rather than western decadence			0
' the @entity8 was found to have the priciest embassy with its new @entity19 site valued at £ 600 million , £ 100 million more than its previous site in @entity130 sold for			1
occupying some of the grandest buildings are @entity27 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , the @entity135 , @entity73 and @entity136			0
the embassy of @entity134 on @entity138 in central @entity1 , which has been valued at £ 100million			1
the research revealed that collectively the @entity141 countries embassies are worth £ 1.1 billion they are all in and around high value postcodes such as @entity15 , @entity138 , @entity17 and @entity16 , and have all had their embassies valued at £ 100million or more			1
there are 30 embassies in the @entity147 postcode alone , in @entity17 , north of @entity148 and @entity16			0
the research also shows that collectively the @entity141 countries embassies are worth the most at £ 1.1billion , while countries such as @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 - are worth a relatively modest £ 85million			1
the @entity156 embassies were found to be the second most valuable as a group , collectively worth £ 881million			1
@entity133 's embassy is located on @entity159 in @entity17			0
@entity156 embassies located in @entity1 have been valued as being collectively worth £ 881million however , some embassies are less pricey than they appear as it was revealed that @entity73 pays just £ 1 a year to run its £ 100million embassy , @entity163 , in one of the world 's most expensive roads , @entity167			1
this is because of a 1991 agreement that allows the @entity42 a luxurious embassy in @entity171 for one rouble a year in exchange			0
@entity174 's @entity159 embassy was also revealed to be a £ 35million asset that could keep president @entity176 going through turbulent times if he chooses to sell it			2
the research revealed that @entity180 and @entity181 are sitting on unexpectedly valuable assets , a £ 30 million building in @entity167 , and a £ 40 million house in @entity15			2
mr @entity64 added that the new @entity8 embassy in @entity19 would form part of a major development that could see other nations flocking to relocate their own embassies			1
he explained : ' obviously some smaller nations as you might expect just had offices or even just consulates			0
meanwhile the @entity119 embassy in @entity10 , west @entity1 has been valued at just £ 750,000			1
@entity195 from @entity196 says the embassy is more about national pride than glamour ' @entity36 's embassy is worth about £ 15million - it 's in @entity16 so there 's no area of @entity1 more expensive			1
it 's right out the back of @entity37			0
' i am sure that the @entity36 embassy property value would increase if @entity34 was not there			2
' when embassies are sold as non-residential buildings they are usually exempt from stamp duty , which counts as a local tax			0
this is calculated in bands , according to the sale value of a residential property , with anything retailing for more than £ 125,000 having a one per cent tax			2
most embassies are likely to fit into the higher bands , taxable at five or seven per cent			0
mr @entity64 added : ' embassies are exempt from local tax			0
if they were to be sold as residential properties you would normally have to pay stamp duty on them			0
the @entity226 in @entity29 , south west @entity1			1
if the island nation was to sell off its @entity1 consulate , the money would pay off 11 per cent of their national debt ' obviously the mayor of @entity1 is very unhappy about this , but we do n't pay any tax abroad for our embassies			2
' earlier this year it was also revealed that foreign embassies had also notched up more than £ 75million in unpaid @entity1 congestion charge debt over the last decade			1
the total value of the congestion charge debt incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in @entity1 since its introduction in 2003 until the end of last year was £ 75,364,182			2
the @entity8 embassy topped the table for the highest number of fines and largest outstanding bill , with 70,637 fines handed out over the ten - year period and a total outstanding bill of £ 8,172,245			1
meanwhile in 2013 , 5,662 unpaid parking fines were incurred by diplomatic missions and international organisations in the @entity42 in 2013 totalling £ 541,599 .			0
