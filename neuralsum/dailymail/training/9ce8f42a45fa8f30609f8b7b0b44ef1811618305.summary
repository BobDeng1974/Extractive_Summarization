by @entity0 a judge has accused prosecutors of sparking a ' serious miscarriage of justice ' after he was unable to give two violent thugs the longer prison sentences he says they deserve			0
judge @entity8 made the comments while sentencing @entity10 , 29 , and @entity11 , 31 , at @entity12 yesterday , after they admitted smashing the jaw of tattoo artist @entity14			1
judge @entity8 branded the prosecution 's decision to accept lesser pleas than the original @entity19 with intent charges ' manifestly flawed ' , when they dramatically reduced the sentences he could deliver			1
anger : judge @entity8 ( left ) branded the prosecution 's decision to accept lesser pleas ' manifestly flawed ' after two men admitted smashing the jaw of tattoo artist @entity14 ( right ) violent ex-soldier @entity10 and his friend @entity11 ambushed @entity29 and @entity30 as they went to get a taxi after closing time at the @entity33 in @entity34 in @entity35 in february 2012			1
mr @entity29 and mr @entity30 were both knocked out cold with punches to the head , and were then kicked as they lay on the ground			0
mr @entity14 , who worked with mr @entity29 at @entity40 in @entity34 , chased the thugs away but @entity10 turned and attacked him in an alley , smashing the 31 - year - old 's jaw in two places			2
he needed extensive facial reconstruction surgery after the attack			0
@entity10 and @entity11 were originally charged with grievous bodily harm with intent , which can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment			1
but prosecutors later accepted @entity10 's lesser plea of @entity19 without intent , which carries a maximum five year sentence			1
they also accepted @entity11 's plea of affray , which is capped at just three years			1
judge @entity8 jailed father - of - two @entity10 for three years and father - of - three @entity11 for 18 months			1
@entity10 ( right ) and @entity11 ( left ) were originally charged with @entity19 with intent , which can carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment			1
but they had respective pleas of @entity19 without intent and affray accepted after sentencing , he said : ' i go as far as to say that this misjudgement in the prosecutorial process i believe has led to a serious miscarriage of justice in that two men who should have been tried for causing @entity19 with intent were allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges which did not reflect their culpability			1
' but @entity74 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for the @entity75 of @entity76 , last night denied there had been any ' misjudgement '			0
he said he would be writing to judge @entity8 about his comments			1
mr @entity74 said the pleas had been considered carefully and discussed with the victims before they were accepted			2
the crime that @entity10 and @entity11 were originally charged with - wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent - carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			1
the ' intent ' element is the key factor in this case and relies on whether or not the perpetrators deliberately caused severe harm			0
@entity19 with intent requires the perpetrator to have set out to cause their victim severe injuries , and therefore falls under @entity96 of the @entity97			2
the maximum sentence for @entity19 with intent is life imprisonment , but there are three categories within the sentencing guidelines that allow for reduced term depending on the injuries caused or the perpetrator 's culpability			1
@entity19 without intent is considered a far less serious charge and falls under @entity108 of of the @entity97			2
it is used when a person has caused their victim serious injuries , but the extent of those injuries was not intended			0
again the charge is split into various categories depending on harm and culpability , but even at its most serious level , the maximum sentence for the crime of five years			0
affray - the charge @entity11 pleaded guilty to - is a public order offence with a maximum sentence of just three years			2
the attack took place after an argument over whose turn it was to use the pool table at the @entity129 @entity10 and @entity11 later attacked mr @entity29 and mr @entity30 outside the pub , before mr @entity14 attempted to come to their aid and had his jaw broken			1
@entity134 , prosecuting , said mr @entity14 had had difficulty sleeping and his social life had deteriorated since he 'd been savagely beaten up			0
she said he had not been able to return to @entity34 since the incident			0
the case was seriously delayed when prosecutors decided to pursue charges against a third man - @entity141 - after accepting evidence from @entity10 and @entity143			2
mr @entity141 was later cleared of all charges by a jury			0
speaking of @entity10 and @entity11 ’s evidence , judge @entity8 said : ' i positively disbelieve what both of you said on oath			1
' he questioned why prosecutors had accepted the evidence against mr @entity141 when the co-defendants had a clear ' self - serving interest ' and had not made written statements to police			0
@entity159 , defending for @entity10 , said he was a ' hard - working ' scaffolder who had served in @entity162 and @entity163 with the army			2
mr @entity159 said @entity10 had a wife , an eight - year - old son and three - year - old daughter and the two - year wait before sentence had already punished them all			2
' he has the mental wherewithal to deal with this , but he ’s extremely concerned about how his wife will deal with this , ' mr @entity159 added			0
scene : the attack on @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity14 took place after an argument over whose turn it was to use the pool table at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 @entity182 , defending for @entity11 , said he had a family and three children			2
he ’d separated from his wife but is expecting a child with a new partner			0
mr @entity182 described the attack as an ' isolated incident '			0
sentencing , judge @entity8 told the two men : ' mr @entity30 and mr @entity29 were trying to get a taxi home with their friends and you both attacked them			1
' ' you were both engaged in the attack that involved punching and kicking and kicking when they were both rendered unconscious			0
' he branded the incident ' serious violence ' , and said that although @entity11 was not sentenced for the attack on mr @entity14 , the affray was ' as bad a case as you can see '			1
@entity204 ( pictured ) says has had difficulty sleeping since being savagely beaten up by @entity10 and @entity11 judge @entity8 said that if the pair end up qualifying for early release , they would both be banned from all pubs in @entity34 while on licence			1
he also gave the men a three - year exclusion order from the @entity33 pub. last night mr @entity14 said he was ' gutted ' that @entity10 and @entity11 had not been jailed for longer			1
' for the trouble it ’s caused me , the sleepless nights , the paranoia , i would prefer it if he [ @entity10 ] went away for a little bit longer			2
' ' but i ’m happy it ’s over with and everyone can just go back to normality			0
the whole process has been quite draining			0
' if you had asked me a year ago i think i would have been a bit angrier			0
i ’m smiling today as i know it ’s over now			0
' @entity74 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for the @entity75 of @entity76 , said after the case : ' we are satisfied that the acceptance of the offer of pleas was correct and proper in the particular circumstances of this case and there has not been any misjudgement on the part of the prosecution			0
' this was a case where we were offered pleas to affray by @entity11 and @entity10 and also , in @entity10 ’s case , to actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm			1
' there were difficulties in relation to the evidence against these two defendants which we considered most carefully before deciding to accept the pleas			0
' we discussed the pleas with the victims beforehand who indicated they were happy with the decision to accept them			2
” he added : ' the pleas were also accepted by a different judge at an earlier hearing who shared the prosecution ’s concerns about the evidence			1
' ' the case proceeded against a third defendant , @entity141 , who pleaded not guilty to affray and grievous bodily harm with intent and was acquitted after full jury trial			0
' ' at the sentencing hearing , as part of the outline of the case , counsel said that the pleas by both men included their involvement in punching and kicking the victims ' ' our view was that the basis of plea did show their involvement in the assaults against the victims and gave the court adequate sentencing powers ' ' we will be writing to judge @entity8 regarding his comments			1

judge @entity8 is angry at charges the prosecution accepted
@entity10 and @entity11 had been charged with @entity19 with intent
but pair had respective pleas of @entity19 without intent and affray accepted
this meant judge @entity8 had sentencing powers dramatically reduced
he branded the prosecution 's decision to accept pleas ' manifestly flawed '
