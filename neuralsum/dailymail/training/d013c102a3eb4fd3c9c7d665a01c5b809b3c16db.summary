by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 04:38 est , 25 january 2014 @entity2 has hit back at a controversial @entity4 study that claimed it would ' die like a virus ' and lose 80 % of its users by 2015			1
researchers at the social network say the study is fatally flawed - and turned it on @entity4 to prove their point			1
using the @entity4 's own method , it found @entity4 would have no students by 2021			1
@entity16 , @entity2 ceo : the firm 's researchers have hit back at a @entity4 study which claimed it will lose 80 % of its users by 2015			1
the team from @entity4 claim the social networking site spread ' like an infectious diseases			2
' they predict its ' decline phase ' has already begun - and will be swift , and used methods normally used to study the spread of disease			0
' extrapolating the best ﬁt model into the future suggests that @entity2 will undergo a rapid decline in the coming years , losing 80 % of its peak user base between 2015 and 2017 , ' they said			2
' the site has ' already reached the peak of its popularity and has entered a decline phase			0
' to explain why social networks are like infectious diseases , the study pointed to similar research done with ideas			0
' ideas , like diseases , have been shown to spread infectiously between people before eventually dying out , and have been successfully described with epidemiological model , ' they say			0
' idea manifesters ultimately lose interest with the idea and no longer manifest the idea , which can be thought of as the gain of “ immunity ” to the idea			0
' @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58 , of @entity2 's data team , used the same methods as the original paper to show that @entity4 was facing a decline in undergraduates of 50 per cent in the next four years and would have none at all by 2021			1
' like many of you , we were intrigued by a recent article by @entity4 researchers predicting the imminent demise of @entity2 , ' they wrote			1
' of particular interest was the innovative use of @entity75 search data to predict engagement trends , instead of studying the actual engagement trends			0
' using the same robust methodology featured in the paper , we attempted to find out more about this ' @entity4 ' - and you wo n't believe what we found ! ' in keeping with the scientific principle ' correlation equals causation , ' our research unequivocally demonstrated that @entity4 may be in danger of disappearing entirely			0
' they also used the same logic to show the world will run out of air by 2060			1
' we do n’t really think @entity4 or the world ’s air supply is going anywhere soon , ' they said			2
' we love @entity4 ( and air )			2
' as data scientists , we wanted to give a fun reminder that not all research is created equal – and some methods of analysis lead to pretty crazy conclusions , they said in a blog post			0
the graph , creating by @entity2 engineers , that show the decline of @entity4			1

@entity2 staff also calculated that air would run out in 2060
claims @entity4 method is fatally flawed
