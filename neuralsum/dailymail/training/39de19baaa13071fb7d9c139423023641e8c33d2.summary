by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 7 january 2013 a man who was shot 20 times with a pellet gun for appearing to be @entity4 refused to retaliate even though he had an actual gun on him at the time			1
' i do n't know			0
i just could n't do it , ' @entity8 said when asked why he did not shoot back at @entity10 when @entity10 attacked him in the parking lot of a @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
@entity10 believed that @entity8 was @entity15 or from the @entity4 but he is neither : he was born and raised in @entity14 and his parents are from @entity17 , and he is @entity18			1
surveillance video shows @entity10 , who has been arrested 10 times with a number of battery and assault charges , approached 24 - year - old @entity8 as he was walking into the store around 3am on wednesday with his girlfriend			1
@entity8 is neither , as his parents are from @entity17 but he was born and raised in @entity37 , and he is @entity18			2
@entity8 simply replied no and kept walking , but that was not sufficient for @entity10			2
the 25 - year - old allegedly yelled at @entity8 for being a ' n * * * * * with a white girl ' as he shot him with a gas - propelled pellet gun			1
walking in : @entity8 ( second from left ) is walking in from the parking lot with his girlfriend ( left ) as @entity10 ( right ) follows them			1
the fourth person is unrelated and uninvolved in the incident first shot : after asking if @entity8 is @entity15 or from the @entity4 , @entity10 begins to fire his pellet gun at close range and @entity8 's girlfriend takes his prior advice and looks for cover firing : @entity10 went on to fire 20 shots at @entity8 before running away when police finally captured @entity10 and told him that @entity8 was neither @entity15 nor @entity4 , he reportedly replied that he did n't care and ' they 're all the same '			1
the security footage shows @entity8 's girlfriend quickly run to hide behind a column as the shooter begins to fire at close range at her boyfriend			1
@entity8 told the @entity62 that there was a reason for her move , as @entity8 said that he previously told her that if they were ever in harm 's way , that she would stay quiet and find cover			2
the video also shows @entity8 's hand go for his waist where he kept his holstered gun , but he never chose to fire			2
' i could n't blow this guy away for something he could change later in life			0
i 'm not going to decide this man 's fate , ' @entity8 told the @entity82			1
he bought his weapon legally and has had a concealed weapons permit for the past five years			0
@entity10 's weapon was also legal : he told officers that he knew he was not allowed to own a firearm so he purchased a pellet gun , which uses compressed air inside metal casings making it a non-lethal weapon			2
that said , it still did damage to @entity8 as he now has to have surgery to have a pellet removed from above his eye			0
tipped off : police released security footage from the @entity12 that showed @entity10 's face , leading to his own mother tipping them off about his whereabouts criminal history : @entity10 has been arrested 10 previous times and he said that he knew he was not allowed to have a real gun because of those felonies so that is why he used a pellet gun ' this is a heinous crime , there 's no doubt about it , ' @entity112 sheriff @entity111 said			1
police eventually captured @entity10 with the help of his own mother			0
she called the tipline and told them the room number that he was staying in at the @entity123 off a highway on @entity125			0
he was charged with aggravated assault			0
there are haunting similarities between this assault and the incident in @entity131 where a racist woman pushed a man she believed to be @entity4 onto the subway tracks as a train was approaching			0
that victim , @entity136 , was from @entity137 and not the @entity4 , and the attacker , @entity139 , used ' @entity140 ' and ' muslim ' interchangeably in her police statement , showing that she clearly does not understand the difference			0
the @entity145 spokesman described her statement as effectively saying : ' i pushed a @entity15 off the train tracks because i hate @entity140 and @entity149 ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers i â€™ve been beating them up			0
' @entity136 died on the tracks in @entity154 on december 29			0

@entity10 , 25 , arrested for shooting @entity8 , 24 , with pellet gun 20 times in @entity12 parking lot
@entity10 reportedly asked @entity8 if he was @entity15 or from the @entity4 before shooting at close range
@entity8 was born in @entity14 , his parents are from @entity17 , he is *catholic*
victim had a *licensed* gun on him at the time of the attack but chose not to fire because ' i 'm not going to decide this man 's fate '
