@entity62 , her best friends and her family did the @entity143 this year @entity62 is now a consultant , blogger , photographer and has dabbled in modelling she had to inject herself with daily with medication that altered the way her immune system functions ‘ it would take me about an hour to have the courage to put it in , ’ @entity12 recalled			1

‘ a lot of my friends say to me " i forget that you have it " , ’ @entity12 said			2
despite her ms , @entity62 took up the offer to go to @entity184 to work for ten months she continued to live her life as happily as she could and formed a relationship with her ms at one point @entity62 ’s @entity27 spread from two lesions to 26 lesions and her legs started to buckle when she walked			1
