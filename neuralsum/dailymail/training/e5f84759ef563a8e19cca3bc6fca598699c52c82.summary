it ’s about time we all started giving @entity3 the credit he truly deserves			1
his reputation remains well and truly intact as one of the best managers @entity9 has never had			0
let ’s not underestimate the job he has done at @entity13			0
a bunch of high - earning , under - performing players - a squad rotten to the core - has been shaken up and transformed into @entity19 winners in a short space of time			1
it reminds me of the incredible job @entity3 did at @entity25 – taking them from the relegation zone to the quarter - finals of the @entity29 in a flash			1
credit where it 's due : @entity3 won promotion to the @entity34 with @entity13 huge difference : the former @entity25 boss has transformed the dressing room atmosphere at @entity38 thump ! @entity39 scored a late winner to sink @entity41 in the play - off final at @entity19 on saturday when he took over , @entity43 - a senior player @entity3 considered the best at the club - came to him saying he was leaving , and telling the boss he had ‘ no chance ’ with the @entity13 squad because it was ‘ the worst dressing room ’ he had ever witnessed			1
eighteen months ago @entity13 had a player who chose to pay a fine of two weeks ' wages - £ 130,000 – rather than sit on the bench for a @entity34 game			1
in january 2012 @entity3 ’s chairman signed a player for a huge transfer fee , put him on £ 100,000 a week , only for the manager to then find out he was n’t fit and was ‘ mentally fragile ’			2
just over a year ago @entity3 had reason to believe an agent fed a ‘ story ’ to a newspaper to whip up more trouble in the @entity13 camp			2
at the start of this season @entity64 told his @entity68 followers he would not be playing for @entity13 in the @entity69			0
somehow @entity3 turned this belligerent hate figure into a dedicated professional and a crucial part of their promotion picture			1
the critics tried to pin the blame for the huge @entity13 wage bill on @entity3 , when clearly most of the players had been signed under different management			2
the harry - haters laughed as @entity13 flopped , and seized on their golden nuggets like : ‘ @entity13 ’s wage bill is bigger than @entity82 ’s			0
’ @entity3 did n’t sanction the wages – almost all the high - earners arrived before he did			1
and those on big money were awful flops who refused to perform and refused to move away from @entity38			0
that criticism of @entity3 smacks of desperation , and yet i ca n’t quite work out why people seem to be so anxious for @entity3 to fail			0
his teams try to play decent football , and at @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity25 he achieved unprecedented success in the modern era			0
after a succession of players and agents were allowed to strip @entity13 of its money and its dignity , @entity3 has restored pride in this terrific football club			2
@entity3 arrived to find a dressing room full of bad players with bad attitudes on big money			1
that situation requires strong and clever management			0
the fact that @entity13 now find themselves back in the @entity34 tells you @entity3 not only got the stinking , sinking ship cleaned out and floating in calmer waters again , he ’s also steered it in the right direction			1
if you ’re not prepared to give @entity3 credit for that then your dislike of him is personal , and a little bit strange			0
what 's the smirk for ? @entity124 was the epitome of everything that was wrong at @entity13 last season			0

former @entity25 boss *inherited* high - earning squad
@entity43 called it the ' worst dressing room ' he 's been involved in
@entity3 has turned the club around ahead of @entity34 adventure
