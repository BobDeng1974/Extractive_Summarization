@entity1 financier @entity0 has announced that he has pulled out of takeover talks with @entity3			1
in a statement given to the @entity5 shortly after midday , @entity0 said : ' i 'm disappointed the @entity3 board has rejected my revised offer , which addressed the club 's immediate and long - term needs			1
' clearly the current directors have a different path they want to go down			0
i hope for the sake of the club and the fans , who 've been very warm and supportive towards me , that it works out			0
@entity1 businessman @entity0 saw two previous bids of £ 18m and £ 20m rejected by the @entity3 board ' i wish the club and fans the best of luck			1
if they want my support in the future , then they only have to ask			0
' @entity0 's statement also said that he ' reserves the right ' to make another offer for the club within the next six months			2
in a separate statement issued by his @entity32 pr advisor , @entity0 also explained that the board 's ' continued failure to provide a counter offer or engage in any meaningful negotiations ' was behind his decision to walk away			2
@entity0 , who already owns @entity39 side the @entity40 , was made aware of the perilous state of @entity3 finances by former @entity44 defender @entity43 , who now coaches at the club where the @entity1 banker 's sons play in @entity48			1
he made his first move just after @entity50 when he offered the board an £ 18m deal but saw it rejected last tuesday			2
@entity3 went into administration in february 2012 and were later relegated to the @entity54 but @entity0 responded 48 hours later when he came back with an improved £ 20m bid that also included an immediate £ 6.5m crisis loan which would have allowed the club to see out the rest of the month			1
in return for this , @entity0 - who is also chief executive of the @entity61 - wanted the club to call an urgent general meeting to vote on proposals to hand him enough new shares to give him control of 51 per cent of @entity3			1
he then planned to make an offer to buy up all remaining stock at 20p per share			0
but the club 's directors were left hamstrung by the decision to vote down their own resolution at last month 's agm which would have allowed them to issue new shares to fresh investors without first offering them to existing stakeholders			0
they were then blind - sided when first the @entity78 and then @entity79 made two surprise share purchases , handing them control of 34 per cent of the club			0
in a 7am notice to the @entity5 , the club announced : ' the board of @entity3 has considered the revised possible offer from @entity0 ( or a vehicle to be established and controlled by him ) ( ' mr @entity88 ' ) which mr @entity0 announced on 8 january			1
' the revised proposal by mr @entity0 was similar to his first proposal in the respect that it sought a placing of 100 million shares ( to be priced at 20p in this proposal ) ( ' placing ' ) which , would require the approval of shareholders ( at least a 75 per cent majority ) at a general meeting			2
' @entity85 rejected the first proposal from mr @entity0 on 6 january on the basis that the @entity85 felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming			2
@entity105 and @entity106 owner @entity104 looks likely to increase his stake in the @entity44 club ' following receipt of the revised proposal from mr @entity0 , the @entity85 has sought the views of a number of major shareholders on this revised proposal and has reached the same conclusion , namely that the resolution to approve the placing is unlikely to achieve the 75 per cent majority required			1
' accordingly , once again , the directors do not intend to hold the general meeting which would be necessary to implement the revised proposal			0
' the question now for the board is one of how to raise the short - term cash they desperately need to keep the club afloat			0
the @entity78 have left a £ 6.5m investment plan on the table but the ruling regime could yet turn to @entity105 owner @entity104 for yet more help			1
@entity104 , who owns 8.92 per cent of @entity3 , has already handed the club a £ 3m loan as the @entity106 tycoon seeks to protect his lucrative commercial contracts			1
but after placing associates @entity133 and @entity135 on to the board , he risks another confrontation with the @entity138 - who have already charged him with breaching ' dual ownership ' rules - if he deepens his @entity44 involvement while remaining in charge at @entity144			0
he may , however , decide to work with the @entity145 who , along with @entity79 , are nearing the kind of shareholder support which would allow them to call an emergency general meeting and make wholesale changes to the @entity44 board			0
@entity153 scores the only goal of the game as @entity3 beat @entity157 strugglers @entity156 rangers are currently second in the @entity157 , 13 points behind leaders @entity161			0

@entity0 will not launch a third bid to take over @entity3
the @entity1 saw previous £ 20 million bid rejected
however , he has not ruled out bidding for the club again in the future
@entity105 owner @entity104 looks set to increase his stake at @entity44
