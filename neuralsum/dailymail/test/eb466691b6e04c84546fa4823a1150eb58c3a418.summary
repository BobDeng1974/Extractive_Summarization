this time there was no man in a @entity3 costume waiting for the @entity5 manager behind the dug - out at @entity7			1
the dark days of ridicule for the @entity10 ’s most successful club have now gone			0
nevertheless , there was a reminder here for @entity15 ’s successor at @entity5 that the task before him remains vast			2
@entity15 lost 2 - 0 here just over a year ago and it transpired to be his last game in charge			1
this result for @entity21 was a goal worse , the performance just as disappointing			0
@entity24 finishes past @entity25 to put @entity26 ahead in just the fifth minute , following a blistering counter-attack @entity24 celebrates his strike in front of the @entity7 crowd as @entity26 began brightly against @entity5 @entity31 ( second left ) watches as @entity32 can only divert his header into the net via the underside of the crossbar stones celebrates after his superb header had doubled @entity26 's lead and put @entity41 's side in control before half time @entity44 slots home @entity26 's third to round off a brilliant display of counter-attacking football , with @entity48 well beaten @entity44 celebrates scoring to put the result beyond doubt , after @entity5 had appealed for offside against @entity52 the @entity55 ’s biggest defeat as @entity5 manager , this setback has arrived just when the optimists were beginning to talk as though the repair job at @entity59 was complete			1
there has been talk of a title challenge for next season and hope that @entity5 would once more finish above @entity65 this time round			2
consistency remains an issue for @entity5 , however , and last week ’s rather unjust defeat at @entity69 has now been followed by a failure that was altogether more comprehensive			2
@entity21 could scarcely believe what he was seeing as his side found themselves well beaten down despite dominating possession in the same fixture last season a man dressed as the @entity3 sat behind then - @entity5 manager @entity15 at @entity7 @entity24 's goal came from a swift counter-attack after @entity5 had a corner			1

nevertheless , on sunday there were signs of weakness in this @entity5 side that @entity136 perhaps presumed he had banished			1
the renaissance man @entity108 , for example , was awful and hauled off at half - time			0
@entity105 — never one to influence a game when his team are struggling — was replaced by @entity142			0
@entity5 ’s left defensive flank , meanwhile , represented a permanently half - open door as @entity102 and @entity103 struggled to deal with the rather predictable threat from @entity26 ’s surging right back @entity83			1
@entity5 enjoyed enough possession throughout to get something from the game			2
they were porous at the back , though , and were put to the sword by an @entity26 team who have been anything but ruthless for the previous eight months of the season			2
afterwards , @entity136 claimed his staff had identified complacency during the warm - up			0
if that is true then maybe the @entity5 manager should have said something in his pre-match address to halt it			2
regardless , his suggestion that his team lost three individual duels in the build - up to the first goal was telling and @entity24 ’s strike illustrated how the afternoon was to play out for both sides			1
it came in only the fifth minute and set the tone			0
@entity169 midfielder @entity88 tracks @entity5 's @entity170 international @entity105 as the visitors dominated possesion @entity104 ( right ) and @entity102 both pulled out of a tackle inside their own box , to allow @entity24 in to score @entity41 celebrates as his side take the lead , thanks to @entity24 's calm finish , with an enthusiastic fist pump @entity108 clatters into the back of @entity86 as he endured a difficult return to @entity7 on sunday afternoon @entity108 was booked early on , as well as blazing an excellent chance over the bar , against the team he represented for five seasons @entity5 had begun reasonably well			1
they passed the ball well at @entity69 last weekend and began this game in a similar groove			0
as soon as the ball broke loose 10 yards inside the @entity26 half , though , it seemed as though @entity5 were already in trouble			1
seeing green grass ahead of him , @entity24 strode forward to feed @entity83 to his right			1
the @entity26 defender tried to find @entity52 breaking through the centre but it was when the ball broke from a red shirt that @entity5 really failed			1
@entity24 , following up the move he had started , was first to the loose ball but still had much to do			2
his first touch was not perfect but the attempts to halt his progress from @entity102 and @entity104 were weak and @entity24 was able to break through and score from just six yards			0
from an @entity26 point of view , it was a superb , counter-attacking goal			0
it should have been stopped at source , though , and @entity5 ’s attempts to gain parity over the next 30 minutes similarly lacked conviction			2
@entity104 could have scored with a shot from the edge of the area and so could @entity108 , while @entity101 headed a @entity105 free - kick straight at @entity82			0
with so much of the game still to run , there was no sense of panic from @entity5			0
the next goal was always likely to be crucial , however , and once @entity26 scored it 10 minutes before half - time the road back already looked too long for @entity136 ’s team			1
@entity169 defender stones was left almost entirely unmarked , and got up higher than @entity227 or @entity108 to score @entity32 , stationed on the line , did his best to head the ball away , while @entity25 could only watch on helpless as it ended up in the net once again the danger started down @entity26 ’s right			0
on this occasion the @entity5 defence cleared for a corner but when @entity85 delivered , @entity31 arrived to head his first @entity26 goal			1
two ahead now , @entity26 were truly in command for the first time			2
@entity136 responded at the break by benching @entity108 — who had been booked — and sending on @entity109			0
once again , @entity5 enjoyed possession			0
@entity110 was denied by @entity82 as he shot on the turn following a corner in the 47th minute but at the other end @entity103 had to be quick to stop the breaking @entity88			0
@entity48 looks exasperated after seeing his side fall further behind , as he could not repeat his heroics against @entity26 from earlier in the season @entity108 , who was replaced at half time , prepares to kick off after @entity26 's second goal , as @entity110 looks on dejected @entity109 came on at half time for @entity108 , but was unable to have much of an impact as @entity5 continued to struggle for penetration @entity103 slides in hard on @entity88 but it was the @entity26 man who came out on top in the battle between the @entity169 starlets @entity110 and @entity105 look to break down the @entity26 defence but without joy as @entity86 and @entity90 close them down @entity84 slides in brilliantly to stop @entity110 's progress as @entity26 limited @entity5 's chances while capitalising on the break @entity26 @entity263 ( away ) - may 2 @entity264 ( home ) - may 9 @entity266 ( away ) - may 16 @entity267 ( home ) - may 24 @entity5 @entity269 ( home ) - may 2 @entity271 ( away ) - may 9 @entity272 ( home ) - may 17 @entity274 ( away ) - may 24 @entity88 was , in truth , having a mixed afternoon			1
eventually , however , the 21 - year - old got it right , playing the ball smartly over the top towards substitute @entity44 with 16 minutes left			1
@entity52 , breaking through the middle , looked yards offside and probably was			0
however , the ball had been played in the direction of @entity44 , and as the @entity5 defence looked for a flag , the @entity283 eased clear to beat @entity25 comfortably and intelligently with his right instep			1
in the visiting dug - out , @entity136 was already preparing his fiercest post-match shellacking of the season			0
he now has six days to elicit a reaction			0
@entity32 is forced to wrestle @entity26 's on - loan winger @entity87 , who put in another excellent display , to the floor @entity44 slots home to finish off @entity5 with a cool finish after the visiting defence had completely switched off it was a difficult day for @entity169 captain @entity110 , who was replaced late on after appearing to be injured , against his former club @entity109 managed to find the net late on , slotting past @entity82 , but the whistle had long gone with the @entity301 comfortably offside			1

@entity24 puts @entity26 ahead after 5 minutes as @entity26 counter-attack at speed
@entity31 doubles host side 's **advantage** with brilliant header from a corner in 35th minute
@entity44 takes **advantage** of poor @entity5 defending to make it 3 - 0 late on
