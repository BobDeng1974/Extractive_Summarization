by @entity0 last updated at 4:23 pm on 19th december 2011 in demand : blackberry handsets are very popular with teenagers but now the company behind the brand is being asked to explain why people are able to download illegal content @entity8 has been ordered to a summit meeting with @entity10 to explain why children are still able to download pornography on its phones			1
young people are able to download pornography through the popular handset even if their phone operator has installed a filter because data flows through the @entity8 ’s own server			1
@entity22 , the company behind the @entity8 , will be joined by other leading phone networks at the meeting called by the telecommunications regulator			2
an @entity10 spokesman told @entity27 : ‘ it was brought to our attention that there is a problem			2
it is to do with the way the operating system works			0
we are very concerned and want to get this resolved as quickly as possible			0
’ mobile phone networks have been able to apply filters to other handsets , such as the @entity39 , but because of data flows through the @entity8 ’s own services leading operators have been unable to block pornography on the popular phone			1
the phone is hugely popular with teenagers , mainly because of its @entity8 messenger service , many of its of its eight million users are believed to be under 18			2
@entity52 mp @entity51 , for @entity53 , has said she is so alarmed at children having access to pornography she has vowed to raise the issue in parliament			0
filter : @entity22 has denied it asked mobile operators to pay for a pornographic block on handsets it is the second blow to the company 's reputation as this summer @entity8 executives were hauled before mps to explain how their service came to be so popular with rioters trying to dodge police			1
barring certain sites is standard procedure in the phone industry , which prides itself on its success with this form of self - regulation			0
but mobile phone networks previously told @entity79 that @entity22 demanded they pay to have bars installed on their customers ’ @entity82 , something that is not standard practice			0
only @entity85 is believed to have had a bar in place for @entity8 users			1
@entity22 , though , said this was not so , that it had never demanded money for installing the blocking software and referred questions on the issue back to the networks .			0

@entity8 hauled before @entity10 to explain why young people are able to download pornography
