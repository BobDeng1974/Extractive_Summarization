by @entity0 @entity2 driver @entity1 , who clocked up 48 points on his driving licence , outside @entity5 a @entity2 driver who clocked up to 48 points on his driving licence has been fined more than £ 1,300 for making false statements to obtain insurance			1
@entity1 , 31 , from @entity5 , @entity9 declared that he had a full @entity11 licence when applying for insurance to drive his @entity2 in february , 2012 , despite his licence being revoked on september 30 , 2009			1
@entity1 was found to be driving on the invalid insurance when he was pulled over by a police officer who spotted him driving not wearing a seatbelt			1
@entity17 , prosecuting , said that officers checked the licence and found that he had 48 points at that time , however the number of points varied during the course of the investigation with some records stating @entity1 had around 27 points			1
the government 's penalty point system means that if a driver accumulates 12 points in three years they will be disqualified			1
the @entity30 has previously blamed failures to communicate between the courts and the @entity33 - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - for problems in the system			0
according to the @entity33 it routinely contacts the courts when notified that a driver has reached the 12 point threshold and it remains up to the court whether to reopen the case			0
@entity1 pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement to obtain insurance at @entity5 yesterday on what would have been the third date a trial had been set for and the 10th listing at court			2
@entity1 , a self - employed businessman , pleaded guilty on the basis that he did not know about the penalty points or the fact that his licence had been revoked when he applied for insurance , a basis of plea not accepted by the @entity59			1
@entity5 @entity5 , @entity9 , where @entity1 pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement to obtain insurance @entity62 , defending , argued that @entity1 had not meant to mislead and , while the statements were false , he did not know them to be false at the time he made them			2
however the law , which dates to the late 1950s , stipulates that the offence is one of strict liability , meaning a defendant can be guilty of the crime without having a guilty mind or knowledge of making a false statement and sentencing was carried out accordingly			0
research last year revealed that 7,000 drivers on the road have 12 points or more - and one woman has clocked up a record 42 penalty points - yet still has a licence			1
it has raised questions in the past about how some motorists have been able to get away without stricter punishments			0
however drivers who break the law will have their licence ' endorsed ' with penalty points - the amount can vary depending on the seriousness of the offence			2
points will stay on the licence for at least four years and in some cases its 11 years			0
new drivers can have their licence revoked if they get six points in the first two years of passing their test			2
to remove expired endorsements , a postal application must be made for a new one			0
the insurance , from @entity105 , cost @entity1 £ 1,800 when it was taken out in february , 2012			2
the court also heard that @entity1 's car was later seized by @entity109 under @entity110 , a scheme which targeted unlicensed and uninsured drivers in @entity9 , and @entity1 paid in excess of £ 13,000 for insurance to reclaim the car			1
@entity1 , who has already been banned from driving for two years following a separate driving case in february , 2013 , was fined £ 875 , ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £ 87 as well as costs of £ 400 , making a total of £ 1,362			0
speaking about how @entity1 had managed to accrue 48 points on a licence a @entity33 spokeswoman said it is up to the courts to decide when a driver is disqualified			1
she said : ' @entity33 's role is to record the information provided by the courts			0
' the courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver			0
' in january it was reported by @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , the @entity11 's largest independent road safety charity , that a man from @entity133 had been allowed to continue driving despite clocking up 45 points on his licence , beating the previous record of 42 points			0

@entity1 , 31 , told his insurance *company* he had a full licence
he was spotted by police and pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt
drivers are usually disqualified for accumulating just 12 points
