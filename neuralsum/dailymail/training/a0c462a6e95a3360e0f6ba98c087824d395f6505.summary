by @entity0 published : 15:37 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:15 est , 7 august 2013 my five - year - old son @entity1 sat beside me in the dentist 's waiting room , his little hand clutching mine as he tried his best to be brave			1
but a few minutes later , i was the one choking back tears as the dentist injected @entity1 's mouth with anaesthetic and tugged a rotten molar from his gums			1
i was filled with a terrible sense of shame			0
he would n't be suffering if i had taken better care of his teeth			1
i 'd assumed that regular tooth - brushing and a healthy , low - sugar diet would be enough			1
to my shock , it was n't			0
a combination of lazy brushing and one too many treats was most likely to blame			0
my only comfort is that i 'm not the only parent in this situation			0
@entity0 , 39 , with her son @entity28 , 5 , at her home in @entity30 in @entity31 @entity1 had to have one of his teeth removed as he had n't brushed his teeth properly the most recent @entity36 figures reveal that tooth decay in under - fives is a major problem , with more than one million pre-schoolers and reception class pupils having at least two fillings			1
each year , 30,000 children end up being admitted to hospital because of rotten teeth			1
many have five or six taken out at once ; some their entire set of baby teeth			2
perhaps it 's hardly surprising , given that 2 per cent of mums say their children do n't brush their teeth at all , and 6 per cent of @entity54 children never have dental check - ups			1
dentists call these juvenile patients ' @entity58 babies ' - children whose teeth have been damaged by soft drinks containing sugar , one of which is @entity58 , and other sweet fare			1
i 'd assumed they had ill - educated parents , so was mortified to discover @entity68 was one of them			1
he and his six - year - old brother @entity71 are banned from fizzy drinks , and have squash , fruit juice or sparkling water			2
they eat porridge rather than sugary processed cereals			0
biscuits , cakes , chocolates and sugary drinks are not allowed in their school playground			0
they have always brushed their teeth twice a day , morning and evening , and i 've spent a small fortune on @entity87 toothbrushes and novelty toothpastes to make the experience fun			2
@entity0 felt dreadful when she had to hold @entity1 's hand at the dentist and watch his tooth being removed , knowing she was responsible yet when the dentist prodded one of @entity1 's bottom teeth , he squealed with pain			1
there was a hole in his tooth , which would have to be extracted , and he was given antibiotics for a gum infection			2
the dentist said i should keep a closer eye on how they brush and how long for			2
i was also told to ditch the ' fun ' toothpastes for one with the same fluoride content advised for adults - 1,350 to 1,500 parts per million			0
at home , i sat down and made a note of how many snacks and treats they eat in a week - and i realised i 'd been deluding myself			0
they were eating a lot of sugar			0
as well as natural sugars in apples , bananas and rice cakes , there were after - school pastries , sweets from grandma , boxes of raisins and iced lollies on a trip to the park			0
and the crumble , custard and flapjacks , which i 'd convinced myself were healthy because they were home - made			0
to my sons ' horror , i 've stopped all after - school sweet treats			0
but when i think of @entity1 cowering in the dentist 's chair , i know i 'm doing what 's right for my children .			1

@entity0 's son @entity68 , 5 , had to have a tooth removed by dentist
