by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 17:02 est , 30 january 2014 researchers have revealed a major breakthrough in treating anxiety disorders			1
a @entity6 team has discovered the region of the brain that controls how anxious we are - and found it was n't where they had thought			1
the team now say it could now be targeted with drugs , leading to far more effective treatments within a decade			2
researchers say the discovery could lead to new treatments for people suffering from anxiety disorders according to the @entity22 , over 18 percent of @entity21 adults suffer from anxiety disorders , characterized as excessive worry or tension that often leads to other physical symptoms			1
previous studies of anxiety in the brain have focused on the amygdala , an area known to play a role in fear			0
however , a team of researchers led by biologists at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) had a hunch that understanding a different brain area , the lateral septum ( @entity41 ) , could provide more clues into how the brain processes anxiety			1
their instincts paid off — using mouse models , the team has found a neural circuit that connects the @entity41 with other brain structures in a manner that directly influences anxiety			1
' our study has identified a new neural circuit that plays a causal role in promoting anxiety states , ' says @entity57 of @entity37 , who led the study			1
' part of the reason we lack more effective and specific drugs for anxiety is that we do n't know enough about how the brain processes anxiety			0
' this study opens up a new line of investigation into the brain circuitry that controls anxiety			0
' the team 's findings in the january 30 version of the journal @entity74			0
in the new study , the team used optogenetics — a technique that uses light to control neural activity — to artificially activate a set of specific , genetically identified neurons in the @entity41 of mice			1
during this activation , the mice became more anxious			0
the researchers also found that even a brief , transient activation of those neurons could produce a state of anxiety lasting for at least half an hour			1
this indicated that not only are these cells involved in the initial activation of an anxious state , but also that an anxious state persists even after the neurons are no longer being activated			0
what really makes us anxious : a brain schematic shows the neural circuit found by @entity37 researchers to play a role in anxiety			1
the lateral septum is circled in red , and controls the process ' the most surprising part of these findings is that the outputs from the ls , which were believed primarily to act as a brake on anxiety , actually increase anxiety , say the researchers			0
knowing the sign — positive or negative — of the effect of these cells on anxiety is a critical first step to understanding what kind of drug one might want to develop to manipulate these cells or their molecular constituents			0
if the cells had been found to inhibit anxiety , as originally thought , then one would want to find drugs that activate these @entity41 neurons , to reduce anxiety			2
however , since the group found that these neurons instead promote anxiety , then to reduce anxiety a drug would have to inhibit these neurons			2
' we are still probably a decade away from translating this very basic research into any kind of therapy for humans , but we hope that the information that this type of study yields about the brain will put the field and medicine in a much better position to develop new , rational therapies for psychiatric disorders , ' said @entity57			0
' there have been very few new psychiatric drugs developed in the last 40 to 50 years , and that 's because we know so little about the brain circuitry that controls the emotions that go wrong in a psychiatric disorder like depression or anxiety			0
' the team will continue to map out this area of the brain in greater detail to understand more about its role in controlling stress - induced anxiety .			2
