this star is fading , just that little bit too soon			0
after @entity3 announced in january his decision to leave @entity5 for @entity6 in the summer , many were anticipating one last hurrah in a red shirt , given so many had come before			1
‘ i want to make sure that i have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over , ’ he said back then , less than three months ago			2
eighty days , in fact			0
plunging his studs into @entity13 ’s ankle in a vital match against bitter rivals @entity15 , one of the most tantalising games on the fixture list , was surely not what he had in mind			1
especially as defeat has left them five points adrift of @entity15 in fourth			1
@entity3 is shown a straight red card against @entity15 after being on the pitch for 38seconds @entity3 makes the long walk back to the dressing room after being sent off against @entity15 when a 19 - year - old @entity3 picked up the ball 40 yards from goal , waltzed past two @entity33 players before finding the bottom left corner with a right - footed drive for his first ever @entity5 strike , his team - mates mobbed him			1
the boy who had joined the club aged eight had become a man			0
that strike had provided a two - goal cushion when a makeshift @entity5 side - hit by injuries - was struggling against bottom - of - the - table wednesday in 1999			1
a bright , twinkling career was beckoning ; one in which his passion , guile and leadership would shine fiercely throughout			2
he would lead the team by example many , many more times			0
to not even be considered as a regular starter , to reduce his own swan - song by three games due to a moment of madness , is not how he would have imagined it ending 16 years later			2
@entity3 celebrates at the end of the game after scoring against @entity65 wednesday in 1999 or that he was not at the heart of their 13 - game unbeaten run in the @entity70 which was driving the team towards a @entity73 spot			1
that he would start just five of those and then be so largely to blame for their capitulation in the 14th			0
the infamous slip last season against @entity80 , which many credit for ending @entity5 ’s title chances , could have been buried beneath all the trophies and silverware			1
but too many crucial mistakes and they begin to stand out more prominently			0
it is not the first time @entity3 has been sent off against @entity15 - he saw red in 2011 @entity3 has been sent off six times in his @entity5 career - seen here against @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity80 this is not the goodbye he would ’ve wanted , or the one he deserves after being the catalyst of a team hanging to the coattails of the league ’s best for over a decade to a @entity73 , two @entity100 , three @entity101 and the @entity102			1
his greatness will never be forgotten , but neither will these high - profile errors at the end if they keep occurring			2
@entity3 has picked up six @entity70 red cards now , often a byproduct of leaders when their passion spills over			1
only seven players have received more , including @entity114 with seven and @entity115 with eight			0
but the big occasions are when these types of explosive players are supposed to be able to keep it under control			0
@entity3 has been @entity5 's inspirational leader for over a decade @entity3 will be best remembered for leading @entity5 to a number of trophies - including the @entity123 and @entity73 there is still the hope of an @entity123 final at @entity127 to celebrate his 35th birthday on saturday , may 30			1
but due to his ban he will not even be in the side to help them reach it in their @entity123 replay against @entity134			0
nor for their next , crucial , @entity70 match against @entity73 rivals @entity136 or the game versus @entity138			2
as it stands there are six games remaining of @entity5 ’s season and @entity3 ’s @entity144 career			1
if they progress to the @entity123 semi-final against @entity148 in his absence , that will be seven , and eight if they make it to the final			0
given all that has gone before , how much he will be desperate to go out on a high before he crosses the @entity154			0
but will @entity155 trust him again ? or has this star been snuffed out too soon ?			0

@entity3 was sent off against @entity15 after just 38 seconds
