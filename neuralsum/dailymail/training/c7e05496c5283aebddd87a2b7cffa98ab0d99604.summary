by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 just like a fine wine , @entity2 is getting better with age			1
the 35 - year - old proved as much on tuesday evening when he put in arguably the greatest goalkeeping performance ever witnessed at a @entity7 during the @entity9 's narrow extra-time defeat to @entity10 in @entity11			1
he conceded twice in that added 30 minutes , failing to stop @entity13 's low strike and @entity15 's sweeping finish , but he had already won the hearts of a nation with a string of fine saves			0
he has since received a congratulatory telephone call from president @entity20 and seen a petition for his name to adorn an airport in @entity47 begin online			0
while the @entity2 @entity55 is still some way off from becoming a reality , the transformation of the former @entity52 keeper from @entity54 flop to the most talked about player in world football - at least for a night - is complete			1
@entity2 began his career at @entity59 in promising fashion after joining from @entity61 for around Â£ 3million in 2003 , making a decisive penalty save to help the @entity63 win the @entity64 against @entity65			2
he continued his impressive form in the @entity67 , cementing his place as the club 's @entity70 goalkeeper ahead of @entity73 @entity72 and @entity74 as sir @entity76 's side chased the title			0
but the honeymoon period did n't last for long			0
in the latter half of his first season in @entity81 , @entity2 fumbled a @entity83 free - kick during a @entity85 last 16 tie against @entity86 and allowed @entity87 to fire home the rebound			1
new boy : @entity2 signed for @entity54 in 2003 but struggled to hold down a starting spot defining moment : @entity2 ( right ) looks devastated after conceding a decisive goal to @entity86 in 2004 on the slide : @entity2 , pictured here after conceding a goal to @entity96 in 2004 , made a number of mistakes for @entity54 @entity54 were out , @entity99 famously ran down the touchline to celebrate and @entity2 's confidence was shot to bits			1
he lost his place in the side to @entity74 but did recapture it in time to help secure a comfortable win against @entity107 side @entity106 in the @entity109 final			0
the @entity9 continued his unconvincing performances during 2004 - 05 , dropping in and out of the side as he failed to convince both @entity76 - and the @entity54 faithful - that he could be the long - term successor to the legendary @entity113			1
@entity114 arrived the following summer and immediately went about doing just that			0
he became a commanding presence behind the @entity117 ' talented back - four and undroppable from @entity76 's first choice lineup			0
@entity2 's brief stint in @entity120 was effectively over			2
fortunately for the @entity122 star , he had impressed @entity123 enough for the then @entity125 manager to sign him on loan for the 2006 - 07 season			1
he 'd be the @entity125 ' no 1 , too			2
the faith shown in him by @entity123 helped reinvigorate @entity2 's career on @entity81 soil			2
gone was the nervous , error - prone keeper who appeared unable to cope with the pressure of playing for one of the world 's biggest clubs , and in his place stood a man who relished the opportunity to pull on his gloves and perform each week			2
faith : @entity125 boss @entity123 took a chance on @entity2 after his indifferent form at @entity59 on the up : @entity2 has revived his career at @entity125 and become one of the club 's key players big impact : @entity2 even scored this incredible goal against @entity152 at @entity153 in january 2012 @entity2 found his best form under the @entity155 , helping the @entity157 club qualify for the @entity158 , reach the 2009 fa cup final and consistently challenge towards the top end of the @entity67 after making his move permanent a year after signing on loan			1
along with @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 , he is viewed by many @entity166 as one of the most shrewd signings of @entity123 ' 11 years in charge			0
some would even describe him as the club 's best keeper since @entity172 graced the blue half of @entity157 during the 1980s and 90s			0
that faith was tested in @entity123 ' final season at the helm when , uncharacteristically , he made a number of errors which cost @entity125 valuable points in their hunt for fourth place			1
a weak @entity183 header was conceded in a draw with @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity186 was allowed to score a lacklustre free - kick at @entity189			0
in total , @entity2 could be directly blamed for at least five point - costing goals			2
when @entity193 took over @entity123 last summer , it appeared as if @entity125 's new boss was already planning for life without the veteran in his squad			0
fresh start : @entity125 boss @entity193 has helped @entity2 find the best form of his career so far no way through : @entity2 keeps out a low effort from @entity10 's @entity203 at the @entity204 still got it : @entity2 keeps out an effort from @entity65 striker @entity207 during a 1 - 1 draw last season @entity210 , a player @entity193 had on loan during his time at @entity213 , was signed from @entity214 on a five - year deal			1
at just 23 when he signed , the @entity216 looked every inch like @entity2 's replacement			2
fast forward almost a year and the picture is very different			0
@entity210 featured in just two @entity67 fixtures last season as @entity2 - now in his mid-thirties - enjoyed his most consistent season in between the sticks			1
he ended the campaign with 15 top - flight clean sheets , a fifth place finish and a two - year extension on his contract , keeping him on @entity157 until at least 2018			1
he 'll be 39 when his deal runs out			0
after watching @entity2 in action over the past year , @entity125 fans wo n't have been too surprised to see their player shine on the biggest stage of them all			1
incredibly , he seems to be improving the older he gets			0
if he can continue the trend at club level , a final farewell in @entity239 in four years ' time might not be such a far - fetched prospect for @entity243 's latest hero .			1

@entity2 made a record 15 saves against @entity10 in the @entity7
the @entity125 keeper enjoyed his best campaign at club level last season
@entity2 endured a *difficult* period at @entity54 earlier in his career
he has become a national hero in the @entity9 after his performances in @entity32
the 35 - year - old signed a new contract until 2018 with @entity125 in april
