a group of @entity3 journalists could cancel a trip to @entity5 because officials in the secretive regime are paranoid about the spread of @entity9 , it is claimed			1
the group had been expected to travel to the @entity5 to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the @entity5 media in a course part - funded by the @entity5 taxpayer			2
but now @entity3 's strict ebola - control measures risk thwarting a project which had been criticised as simply teaching the regime 's spin doctors how to more effectively peddle propaganda			1
@entity3 leader @entity21 inspecting a newly - built @entity22 in @entity23 : a plan for 46 @entity3 journalists to visit the @entity5 could be thwarted by the country 's tight @entity9 control measures @entity3 has been under effective lockdown for more than three months to keep the ebola virus from crossing its borders , with all arrivals facing 21 days quarantine before they can enter the country			1
since the @entity9 measures were announced in late october , visas for nonessential travel have been halted and @entity3 media has launched a daily barraage of constant reports depicting the dangers of the disease			1
@entity3 's journalistic exchange trip appears to be the latest victim of the arguably over-enthusiastic health protection measures , according to a report in the the @entity46 which cited ' @entity48 sources '			1
the paper had earlier broken news of the expected visit by 46 journalists , who work in @entity3 's tightly controlled state media and , its report claims , face execution if they dare criticise their country 's regime			1
@entity58 of @entity59 , chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on @entity3 , told reporters @entity62 and @entity63 a cancellation could help the ministers avoid embarrassment ' the @entity48 might see it as a blessing in disguise if they can be given a reason for reconsidering giving a group of people whose speciality is propaganda rather than journalism the opportunity of coming to the @entity5 , ' he said			1
' i think it has less to do with @entity9 and more to do with the insecurity of the regime and their determination to try to prevent any influence by foreigners , aid workers or diplomats			0
' @entity21 gives field guidance to managers at the mushroom farm : the group had been expected to travel to the @entity5 to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the @entity5 media the @entity48 last month it is funding the project , which will be delivered by the @entity94 and is called ' @entity95 : working in @entity3 to connect its journalists to an internet world			1
' it was claimed it could cost the @entity5 taxpayer as much as Â£ 70,000 , but the @entity48 said no figures for the course had been finalised , and said it was being run as part of the ' critical engagement ' activities with the country			0
in a written answer to the @entity110 baroness @entity108 said ' the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting			1
' @entity3 is one of the most controlled media environments in the world			1
all news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored			2
there is just one news agency , the @entity124 , that operates throughout the country			0
internet access is poor , with many north @entity3 only able to access a form of an intranet			1
radios and televisions supplied to @entity3 come pre-tuned to @entity132 - controlled stations such as @entity133			1
since @entity21 took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country			0
this has included an interview @entity142 gave to @entity143 after travelling to the country earlier this year , following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with @entity21			0
but a lot of the news coming from @entity3 appears to be tightly stage - managed			1
information about the country 's economic difficulties or famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences			0
she added : ' the project aims to expose participants to the @entity5 media , instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources			0
' the students took part in a pilot workshop in @entity23 in october and the study tour to the @entity5 was expected take place in the coming weeks			0
@entity3 has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world , precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country			2
journalists have to be a member of the @entity177 and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds			0
there is just one agency service for the country			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity48 said : ' the @entity5 has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in @entity3			2
last month , the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the @entity189			0
' this project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the @entity189 @entity194 into human rights in the @entity3			2
it is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in @entity3			2
' a @entity189 report earlier this year found that @entity3 are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology			2
it said : ' there is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion , as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion , expression , information and association			0
' the report said that propaganda is used by the @entity221 to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished , with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the ' ultimate ' punishments			0
an example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when @entity236 died in 2011 , but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released .			0

ebola - control measures have put the paranoid state on total lockdown
all visitors to @entity3 face a 21 - day period of medical quarantine
@entity249 says cancellation of the trip could save ministers ' embarrassment
