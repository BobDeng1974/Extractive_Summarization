casually sipping a juice drink – with his high - visibility vest beside him on a table – a police officer chats to a colleague in the cafe of a health food store			1
it is in a burglary hot spot and a short distance from the scene of the 2011 @entity13 riots			0
but they are not two constables taking a break after pounding the beat			0
they are sitting in what passes for a police station in the constituency of crime prevention minister @entity22			2
last week the delighted @entity23 mp announced the opening of the police ' contact point ' in her local branch of @entity28 as ' great news '			1
@entity30 in @entity31 , north @entity32 , is now a police contact point where the public can meet officers and report crimes it is intended to replace the police station in @entity31 , which closed in 2013 after more than a century of service to the community			1
the new facility is supposed to offer all the services that would normally be provided by a police station , including receiving crime reports , giving advice to victims , processing witness statements and handling driving licences and insurance documents provided by motorists after accidents			2
but when @entity54 reporters observed the ' contact point ' over two evenings last week , the police officers had no desk , no private area where they could speak to members of the public in confidence , no means of logging on to the police national computer , and they appeared not to have official forms			1
in the entire time the officers were there , not one offence was reported to them			1
their only ' customer ' during the first two - hour session was a passer - by who recognised one of the pcs from a dog - attack inquiry a year ago and popped in for a chat			0
a pc on duty at a costa coffee shop in @entity78 , east @entity32 , with a few leaflets to give to anyone who approached him as she left the store , the woman remarked to her husband : ' if they spent two hours walking the streets it might be more useful			0
' this is the reality of policing in 2015 as forces struggle to cope with a 20 per cent budget cut imposed by home secretary @entity92			1
hundreds of police stations have closed , with the public offered a part - time service – dismissed by critics as a ' cops in shops ' gimmick			1
the officers deployed at the @entity31 branch of @entity28 relieved their boredom by perusing the shelves of antioxidant vegetable juice , vegan tofu and sea salt bathing crystals , or trying out the store 's ' reverse osmosis de-ionising ' water filter			2
one told an undercover reporter : ' if we were n't here , we would either be on the beat or visiting people at home , following up crime incidents that have been reported			2
' the contact point is open on wednesdays and thursdays between 6pm and 8pm , and on saturdays between 1pm and 3pm			1
campaigners say it should be a matter of shame for @entity121 that the local police station , which closed two years ago and is being sold to developers , has been replaced by two pcs occupying borrowed space in the high street for just six hours a week			1
to give ms @entity22 credit , she campaigned vigorously against the closure			0
but in her message to constituents last week , she welcomed the latest development as a victory			0
' residents will once again have a local contact point where they can meet local police and trained volunteers , and among other things will be able to report crimes , get crime prevention advice and hand in or collect lost property , ' she wrote			1
hundreds of police stations have closed , with the public offered a part - time service – dismissed by critics as a ' cops in shops ' gimmick however , an investigation by @entity54 has exposed her claims about the service now offered as wildly unrealistic			1
undercover reporters who watched the police deployment at @entity155 on wednesday and thursday found the scheme to be badly organised and virtually useless in terms of combating crime			1
there was no @entity161 logo on display outside the store , and the only indication that the premises had been designated a ' contact point ' was a small notice posted above head height just inside the entrance			1
no senior police officers were present and the shop seemed unprepared for the constables ' arrival , leaving them in the embarrassing position of having to ask the store manager where they should sit			1
@entity178 , chairman of the 700 - member @entity31 and @entity180 , said : ' it looked like they were two policemen on their break			0
there has been virtually no publicity			0
a proper service should have been put in place , not this sort of half - hearted measure			0
' on thursday evening – the second day of the initiative – the officers brought crime prevention leaflets which they laid out on a table			2
store manager @entity195 said : ' i 'm quite happy to have them here – it deters shoplifters			0
' crime in the area has increased and the nearest 24 - hour police station is four miles away			2
there is one closer , but it shuts on sundays and mondays , and after 6pm			0
official figures for @entity207 borough , which includes @entity31 , show violent crime in 2014 rose from 4,514 offences in the previous 12 months to 6,296 ; rape cases from 135 to 180 ; robbery from 926 to 1,019 ; and domestic burglary from 1,979 to 2,180			1
the run - down building that was @entity214 for 100 years			0
it was shut down in 2013 officers deployed at the @entity31 branch of @entity28 relieved their boredom by perusing the shelves of antioxidant vegetable juice , vegan tofu and sea salt bathing crystals the @entity54 visited a similar initiative in @entity32 last week			2
there a uniformed police officer sat for an hour in a @entity227 outlet at a @entity229 supermarket in @entity78 without speaking to anyone for the entire time			2
he had to leave an hour before his shift was due to end when the cafe closed for the night			2
the three - times - a - week service has been operating since the local police station closed last october			1
@entity236 advertises a ' cuppa with a copper ' at a cafe in @entity240			0
but critics say it is wrong to expect a woman who , for example , has been sexually assaulted to tell a police officer or volunteer about her ordeal in a coffee shop , where others may overhear , and there are no support services on site			2
a police review of the ' contact point ' scheme last year found that makeshift police desks in supermarkets , libraries and community centres were being used by an average of just one person a week and failed to offer good value for money			1
figures from the watchdog , @entity265 , show that in 2009 - 10 , there were 1,218 police counters across @entity268 and @entity269 where people could report crime			2
by the end of next month , 264 are due to be shut down			0
a @entity161 spokesman said : ' we remain committed to the delivery of contact points as part of our @entity279 strategy			0
' a spokesman for ms @entity22 said : ' we will continue to work with police to ensure the service is helpful and effective for residents			0
' the closure of disused local ‘ nicks ’ may be bad for victims of crime but has been welcomed by imaginative developers			0
in @entity291 , @entity290 police station is being turned into a hostel for the homeless – and given more than £ 100,000 by the @entity294 , who is at the same time cutting back on officers			1
the @entity296 in @entity297 has two branches , at @entity299 and @entity300 , based in former police stations			1
owner @entity302 said : ‘ they are just really attractive old buildings			0
’ demolition work recently began on a large police @entity305 in @entity240 that is to become a branch of supermarket @entity308			0
and in the @entity313 suburb of @entity314 a @entity311 police station is now an infants school			0
architects kept white - tiled cells in the basement and turned them into a library			0
overall , one in five police stations has been closed to the public since the last election .			1

hundreds of police stations have closed in wake of 20 *%* budget cuts
police ' contact point ' has opened in a @entity155 in @entity331
officers had no desk and no way of logging on to police national computer
no offences reported to them on two nights and they had no official forms
