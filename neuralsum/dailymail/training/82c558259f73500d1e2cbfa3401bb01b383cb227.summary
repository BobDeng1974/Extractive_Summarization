by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 19:21 est , 13 may 2013 appeal : @entity2 accompanied by daughter @entity3 , left and campaigner @entity4 at the @entity5 in @entity6 the decision on whether to allow two men to end their lives with medical help will not be based on sympathy for their desperate plight but on legal principles alone , the country ’s most senior judge declared yesterday			1
lord judge , the lord chief justice , was speaking at the opening of a test case that will rule on whether those with extreme physical conditions should be able to call on doctors , family or friends to help them die			1
two men have gone to the @entity25 to win the right to end their lives			2
one , @entity2 , 57 , a former builder paralysed in a road accident 23 years ago , wants a doctor to kill him , preferably by lethal injection			1
he is asking the court to guarantee that any doctor who kills him will not be charged with murder			2
the second is a man with locked - in syndrome known only as @entity37 , who wants current legal guidelines on assisted suicide to be loosened to allow a medical professional to help him kill himself			2
in a statement , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i am in pain every single hour of every single day			1
i have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot			0
now i feel worn out and i am genuinely fed up with my life			0
i feel i can not and do not want to keep living			0
‘ i feel trapped by the situation and have no way out			1
i am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it			0
i feel enough is enough			0
’ right to die : @entity2 , 58 , is paralysed from the neck down ongoing : @entity2 with @entity4 whose husband @entity55 suffered from locked in syndrome and started the legal battle @entity59 , appearing for mr @entity2 , said : ‘ he feels that he is trapped in his body , that he can not enjoy or endure a life that is so monotonous and painful and lacking in autonomy			1
he wishes a doctor to end his life			0
’ both men say @entity66 , which guarantees the right to privacy and family life , should give them the right to decide how their lives should end			0
lord judge , who is sitting with the @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 , told the court : ‘ we are acutely aware of the desperate situation in which these appellants find themselves , and we are very sympathetic			1
’ but , he added , ‘ we can not decide this case as a matter of personal sympathy ’			1
it must be decided ‘ on the basis of principles of law ’			1
the case comes as the former labour lord chancellor @entity86 prepares to launch a @entity87 in the @entity88 tomorrow that could lead to a law allowing a doctor to end the life of a person with a terminal illness who is expected to live for less than six months			0
semantics : lord @entity97 , left , said the terms of @entity86 's , right , bill are based on ' euphemisms ' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as ' assisted dying ' rather than ' assisted suicide ' critics say he is trying to push a right - to - die law through @entity107 on the back of heart - rending court cases , and a prominent peer , @entity111 , has condemned him for using ‘ orwellian spin ’			1
mr @entity2 , a father of two , joined the case after the death last year of locked - in syndrome sufferer @entity116 days after the @entity5 rejected his plea for a doctor to kill him			1
mr @entity116 ’s widow @entity4 is continuing his case before the @entity25 judges			2
the @entity5 ruled that voluntary euthanasia is murder and that it is up to @entity107 , not the courts , to change the law			0
mr @entity2 said outside the court yesterday that simply having the legal right to die ‘ would give me peace of mind enough to prolong my life ’			1
he added : ‘ otherwise i am constantly looking , if i want a way out , how on earth can i do it , without getting someone into trouble			2
i just want my wishes to be respected			0
’ however , he said he was ‘ not confident because i ’ve seen the legal system			2
it ’s already failed people			0
we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0
