by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 25 march 2013 the @entity1 is sending out what may be its final distress call unless $ 500,00 can be found in the next two months to save the transatlantic cruise ship from the scrap heap			1
a preservation group is leading a campaign to secure a permanent home for the 990 - foot - long vessel but is in desperate need of funds to keep it afloat			1
talks are under way with developers and investors about the ship 's long - term future , but without the emergency funding , its caretakers fear they will run out of money before a deal is inked			2
campaign : money and time are running out for the historic ocean liner @entity1 , moored in @entity27 , which needs $ 500,000 of funding to stay afloat rusting away : an enclosed walkway on the once - glamorous cruise ship is now just a barren shell the historic ocean liner carried princes and presidents across the @entity35 in the 1950s and 1960s but has spent decades patiently awaiting a savior at its berth on the @entity27 waterfront			1
' we 've made progress on the fundraising side and the redevelopment side , ' said @entity44 , executive director of the @entity1 and granddaughter of the ship 's @entity27 - born designer , @entity46			1
' our immediate goal is to buy some time			0
' the group has raised $ 1 million through fundraisers and a website , where contributors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $ 1 per square foot			1
but the campaigners say they desperately need donors with deep pockets and high profiles to help save the ship			1
' are we giving up on successfully redeveloping the ship as a self - sustaining entity ? absolutely not , ' said @entity62 , head of the redevelopment efforts			2
at risk : the 990 - foot - long ship could be sold for scrap in two months time unless $ 500,000 is raised to save it high costs : it costs $ 80,000 every month for mooring , maintenance , insurance and security ravaged : moored in @entity27 , the @entity1 is now owned by the nonprofit @entity1 ' we continue to have active discussions with potential partners , we have ideas of potential sites for the ship , but we need more time to get it off the ground ... and we 're running out of runway			1
' it costs $ 80,000 a month just for mooring , basic maintenance , insurance and security , he said			0
the conservancy is exploring potential partnerships with four entities in @entity27 and @entity92 to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with 500,000 square feet of space for a hotel , theater , restaurants and shopping			2
the sluggish economy and other factors have slowed negotiations , @entity62 said			0
as talks continue , he said , the hope is to convince corporate sponsors , influential politicians and prominent business leaders - are you listening , @entity109 and @entity110 ? - to lend their political and financial capital to the effort			0
' any way you look at it , there is no downside to this project , ' @entity62 said			0
' it 's an economic and community development project that 's going to create jobs			0
' a lot of work to do : the rusted and ruined interior view of the @entity1 heyday : the @entity1 pictured in front of the @entity125 skyline and @entity126 as it begins its first voyage along the @entity128 to @entity129 from @entity92 in 1952 the @entity1 carried more than one million passengers at record - breaking transatlantic speeds over the course of 400 round trips from 1952 to 1969 , among them president @entity135 , @entity136 of @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
a joint venture between the @entity142 and ship designer @entity143 , the luxury liner was made with hidden military might - it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles before refueling			2
after being decommissioned it changed hands multiple times , from the @entity142 and on through a series of restoration - minded investors			0
it was towed from @entity154 to @entity155 to @entity156 , finally arriving in @entity27 as a gutted hulk in 1996			0
another succession of developers and a cruise lines failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great			2
a local philanthropist 's 11th - hour gift of $ 5.8 million allowed the @entity1 to save the ship from the scrapper and keep it berthed and maintained for 20 months			1
' it 's an all hands on deck moment , ' @entity46 said			0
' now is the time , there 's a window			0
within months it will close unless everyone assists in the effort			0
' record holder : the once - great liner is still the holder of the @entity179 for the fastest trans - @entity35 crossing which it set in july of 1952 special honour : the ship is still the only man - made object within @entity187 to bear the name @entity1			1

vessel carried more than one million passengers over 400 round trips
