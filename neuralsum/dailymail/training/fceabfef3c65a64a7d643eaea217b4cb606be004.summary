published : 10:48 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 31 may 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 could be used to find @entity4 - size alien planets capable of supporting life , it has been claimed			1
researchers at @entity7 say the telescope could look for small , rocky exoplanets orbiting strange ' failed stars ' known as brown dwarfs			1
researchers believe the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life			0
brown dwarfs are bodies without enough mass to ignite nuclear fusion and become stars - and researchers say they could habour rocky exoplanets capable of supporting life most stars in the cosmos are too weak to even ignite thermonuclear fusion in their cores , thus they never visibly light up			1
instead they emit primarily infrared light , which the @entity34 can easily detect			1
astronomers refer to these ' failed stars ' as brown dwarfs			1
they also believe some dark matter may consist of dark celestial bodies like brown dwarfs , which do not produce optical light and are too faint to visibly detect from @entity42			0
' our program represents an essential step towards the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial planets and carries the compelling promise of studying the concept of habitability beyond @entity42 - like conditions , ' the team wrote			0
the team is aiming for @entity4 - size planets because of their importance in planetary formation models , lead author @entity53 told @entity58			0
' eventually these planet embryos , the size of @entity4 , those would collide and form bigger rocky planets , or the core of ( gas giant ) planets such as @entity66 , ' @entity53 said			2
brown dwarfs are brighter in the infrared – the wavelength in which heat radiates – and those we can see are relatively close to @entity42 , making it easier to detect the effect of any planets on their motions			2
the @entity1 seen against the infrared sky			2
it could now help look for potentially habitable planets around ' failed ' stars @entity34 is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space			1
its highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes , including dusty stellar nurseries , the centers of galaxies , and newly forming planetary systems			0
@entity34 's infrared eyes also allows astronomers see cooler objects in space , like failed stars ( brown dwarfs ) , extrasolar planets , giant molecular clouds , and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets			1
astronomers will seek small planets crossing the face of these brown dwarfs to look for life			2
the planets sought would orbit more closely than @entity112 does to the sun , but the faint warmth of brown dwarfs could still make such inner regions habitable , researchers said			2
in a brown dwarf 's ' habitable zone ' it 's possible that a planet could pass between the brown dwarf and @entity42 more than 50 times a year , providing multiple attempts to study them			1
the scheme could also help find targets for the forthcoming @entity126 , which will be able to probe planetary atmospheres to look for traces of oxygen			0
' right now , there are no projects able to find an @entity42 - sized planet whose atmosphere can be studied with the @entity126 , ' he said			0
the proposal is ne of several being considered to further extend @entity34 's mission			0
@entity34 launched in august 2003 , and ran out of coolant four years ago but is observing new targets ( such as near - @entity42 objects ) as part of an extended mission .			0

small , rocky exoplants near the failed stars could be habitable
will use @entity2 's *spitzer* telescope to search for infrared *signatures*
