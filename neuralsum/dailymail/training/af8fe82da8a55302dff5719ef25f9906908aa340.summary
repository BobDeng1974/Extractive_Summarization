by @entity1 reporter published : 03:00 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 18:51 est , 28 september 2012 last laugh : @entity3 has kept his job as chief executive of @entity7 blunder security firm @entity8 the head of bungling security firm @entity8 will keep his job despite an independent review finding the company guilty of ‘ mishandling ’ its @entity15 contract			1
embattled @entity3 , whose pay and benefits package was worth £ 5.3million last year , had been widely expected to lose his lucrative post over the fiasco			0
but instead , two of his deputies will pay the price for the group ’s failures during the @entity24			0
the company ’s @entity27 boss @entity26 and events chief @entity29 have both resigned			1
@entity8 signed a £ 284million contract to provide @entity24 security guards , but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts and could not deliver and the army was drafted in			2
a damning report by accountancy firm @entity36 found the company ’s handling of the deal was ‘ ineffectual ’			1
it said the group was ‘ capable of fulfilling the contract ’ but ‘ did not recognise ’ the scale of the work , and listed a catalogue of errors , including bad management			1
controversially , however , @entity36 said it was not ‘ in the best interests of the company ’ for mr @entity3 to leave , despite the fact he was twice dragged in front of mps to explain the fiasco			0
@entity8 said in a statement : ' whilst the ceo has ultimate responsibility for the company 's performance , the review did not identify significant shortcomings in his performance or serious failings attributable to him in connection with the @entity15 contract			0
' @entity68 mp @entity67 , who is chairman of the @entity69 and led the hearings into the @entity8 blunders , said the decision to keep mr @entity3 was ‘ not closure ’			0
but @entity8 chairman @entity74 said : ‘ [ mr @entity3 ] could n’t be expected to in detail be responsible for every large contract			0
’ chief operating officer @entity26 , pictured left , is one of two senior directors to have resigned after the @entity7 security fiasco the report said the contract problems were largely specific to the @entity7 , with the company not planning sufficiently for the scale and complexity of what was needed			1
@entity26 was responsible for the contract and for ensuring it was delivered on budget and on time , while @entity29 was the account director who said just before the @entity24 that the company could have delivered two events of that scale at the same time			2
however , @entity3 , who has been with the world 's biggest security group for 27 years , has been the face of the @entity15 failure , taking to television and radio to apologise to the @entity27 public and twice being hauled in front of a @entity100 to explain what had happened			2
@entity103 mayor @entity102 told @entity104 97.3 radio it was right the @entity8 bosses quit over the @entity7 fiasco			1
he said : ' the rank and file , the troops on the ground , did a wonderful job , but when you look at what happened in the management of those hordes of @entity8 employees who did a great job , i 'm not going to try and persuade them to stay this morning			2
' @entity8 fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts at the @entity24 , but failed to provide the required 10,400 contracted security guards police have issued a photograph of a prisoner who escaped from custody by climbing out of a window at a court			1
@entity130 , 27 , absconded from @entity131 in the @entity132 on tuesday afternoon			0
@entity133 said that while he is not dangerous , he should not be approached			0
they urged anyone who sees him to contact police immediately			0
the force said that the man was the responsibility of security firm @entity8 at the time			2
it is believed the prisoner escaped through a window in the building			0
@entity8 said they are carrying out a full investigation into the incident and will be working closely with the @entity149 and relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances			0
@entity8 has largely prospered under @entity3 , who has presided over a share price rise of some 76 percent since being elevated to group ceo in july 2005			0
but investors have worried that the @entity7 affair could jeopardise @entity8 's relationship with the government , a core customer , at a time when @entity27 wants to heavily involve the private sector in running public services			1
government deals account for over half of @entity8 's £ 1.8billion of @entity27 revenue and make up more than 20 per cent of its pipeline of potential @entity27 work , which includes prison management deals and electronic tagging contracts			2
@entity8 , which has estimated its loss on the @entity7 contract at around £ 50 million , is the world 's biggest private security company with more than 650,000 staff worldwide			1
the review said the large numbers of people being taken through each stage of the recruitment process gave a sense of comfort that all was well , but failed to identify the extent to which individuals were actually deployable			0
@entity8 is the world 's biggest private security company with more than 650,000 staff worldwide it said the problem was not the result of a failure in any of the company 's it systems , but one of inadequate marshalling and interpretation of data			1
the project management team reported that the required workforce numbers would be met and it was only at the time of the significant ' ramp - up ' in staff needed from july 1 that the inaccuracy in the information was identified			1
the @entity36 report also highlighted @entity8 's failure to appreciate the scale and nature of the project , in particular to properly incorporate and act upon feasibility assessments .			1

chief operating officer and head of global sales to go after @entity7 blunder
report found *monitoring* and tracking of security workforce was inadequate
also concluded that management failed to appreciate scale and exact nature of the project
