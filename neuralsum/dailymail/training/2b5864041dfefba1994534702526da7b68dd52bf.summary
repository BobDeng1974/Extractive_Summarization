by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 11:45 est , 16 july 2012 @entity5 's top military official - a key mentor to young new leader @entity3 who served under his father - has been removed from all posts because of illness , state media said on monday in a surprise announcement that shakes the core of the authoritarian country 's power structure			1
@entity12 had looked healthy in recent appearances , and his departure fed speculation among analysts that @entity3 purged him in an effort to put his own mark on the nation he inherited seven months ago when his father @entity20 died			1
at the same time , there was no sign of discord at @entity12 's last public appearance at a high - level event , barely a week ago			2
prominent position : top military official @entity12 , right , who has been removed from his posts , led the funeral procession for @entity5 's @entity20 along with the former leader 's son @entity3 , left the decision to dismiss the 69 - year - old from top military and political posts was made at a @entity36 meeting on sunday , according to the official @entity37			1
it was not immediately clear who would take @entity12 's place , and the dispatch did not elaborate on his condition or future			2
@entity44 , a @entity5 analyst at the @entity45 , was sceptical of the illness claim , in part because of @entity12 's recent apparent health			1
he also said @entity12 won his major promotions at a september 2010 party conference but received none in april , which stirred speculation about the general 's future			0
' there 's a very high probability that it was n't health issues , but that he was purged , ' said mr @entity44 , who said the move could be interpreted as a strong signal to anyone seeking to challenge @entity3 - even if @entity12 never directly defied the new leader			1
the dismissal comes as @entity3 makes waves in other ways			0
state television showed him appearing at a music concert and visiting a kindergarten recently in the company of a mysterious woman who carried herself much like a first lady			0
mentor : ousted army chief @entity12 , left , pictured alongside @entity3 , right , at a mourning service for @entity5 's former leader @entity20 in @entity75 in 2011 her identity has not been revealed but her public presence was a notable change from @entity20 's era , when his companions were kept out of state media			1
the state of @entity5 's million - man army , one of the world 's largest , is studied closely in @entity86 , which stations many of its more than 600,000 troops along the world 's most heavily armed border , and in @entity91 , @entity92 , which keeps more than 28,000 troops in @entity86 as a deterrent			1
@entity5 has repeatedly threatened in recent months to attack @entity86 's president and @entity97 's conservative media , angry over perceived insults to its leadership and @entity92 - @entity86 military drills that @entity75 says are a prelude to an invasion			2
a @entity5 artillery attack in 2010 killed four @entity86 and raised fears of war			0
@entity12 was vice marshal and chief of the general staff of the @entity107			0
in 2010 , he was promoted to key political posts in the @entity36 , including top spots on the @entity110 of the @entity36 and the @entity111 of the party 's influential @entity112			0
that boosted him to the highest political circles - along with @entity3 , @entity3 's uncle @entity116 and other trusted members of @entity20 's circle of advisers			1
@entity5 's top military official @entity12 , left , was regarded as a mentor figure to @entity3 , who took over as leader of @entity5 following the death of his father in 2011 @entity12 had been at @entity3 's side since the young man emerged publicly as @entity20 's successor in 2010 , often standing between father and son at major events			1
he was among the small group of men who accompanied @entity20 's hearse through snowy @entity75 during the funeral procession			2
in the months after @entity3 took power , he accompanied the new ruler on his first trips to visit military units in a pointed show of continuity and military support as @entity3 sought to shore up the backing of the nation 's troops			0
@entity12 's departure could be the result of him losing a power struggle with rising star @entity149 , the military 's top political officer tasked with supervising the army , said @entity152 , a professor at @entity97 's @entity153			2
@entity149 , originally a @entity36 official , was handed several top jobs and was named a vice marshal in april			0
@entity12 had been anointed as @entity3 's patron during the young man 's rise to power , @entity152 said ' but after @entity3 formally took power , @entity149 has emerged as no. 2 , ' the professor added			1
the dismissal of the top army official is an especially significant move in @entity5			2
@entity20 elevated the army 's role when he became leader after the 1994 death of @entity170 , his father and the nation 's founder			2
@entity3 has upheld his father 's ' songun ' military - first policy , but in april he also promoted younger officials with economic backgrounds to key party positions in line with his push to build up the nation 's economy			0
@entity5 's late former leader @entity20 , pictured , counted @entity12 among his most trusted advisers in @entity97 , @entity184 , an analyst at the private @entity86 think tank @entity185 , said he expected more ageing officials to be dismissed in coming weeks , calling the move part of a ' generational change '			1
political and military shuffles in @entity5 are often mysterious , and officials sometimes drop out of sight without explanation			0
many top @entity5 officials , however , appear to stay in their posts until they fall ill or die			0
vice marshal @entity195 , who held the no. 2 post at the powerful @entity197 , died of heart disease in 2010 at the age of 82			0
the robust @entity12 , who had served as chief of the general staff since 2009 , showed no sign of illness when he spoke in late april at a meeting of top officials marking the 80th anniversary of the army 's founding			1
the @entity5 's state television and main @entity210 newspaper also reported @entity12 's dismissal			1
in a photo posted by state media on july 6 , a healthy - seeming @entity12 was shown talking to people who had just moved into new housing in @entity75			1
he was also cited in state media as accompanying @entity3 to public events as recently as last week			1
' whether because of a physical malady or political sin , @entity12 is out , and @entity75 is letting the world know to not expect to hear about him anymore , ' said @entity221 , an assistant professor at @entity223 's @entity222 in @entity86			0
it 's too early , @entity221 said , to determine ' whether @entity12 's stepping down is a manifestation of civil - military tensions , or @entity3 's attempt to consolidate control ' over the army			2
@entity12 , though a powerful figure , arrived on the national scene fairly late , during @entity20 's final years , @entity221 said			1
' perhaps he was always meant to be a transitional regent figure , and his function is played			0
' the @entity234 has remained locked in a state of war and divided since a truce in 1953 ended three years of fighting			0
animosity has deepened since a @entity5 rocket launch in april that the @entity240 called a cover for a test of banned long - range missile technology			0
@entity5 said the launch , which failed shortly after lift off , was meant to put a satellite into orbit .			0

@entity12 was a member of @entity5 's late former leader @entity20 's trusted inner circle
experts claim the surprise move is evidence of ' generational change ' in the authoritarian country under its new young leader @entity3
the army chief was relieved from his posts *due* to illness , according to state media reports
