by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 07:03 est , 14 november 2012 banking giant @entity3 could leave @entity5 if @entity6 succeeds with his bid to break up @entity8 , its chairman warned last night			1
sir @entity9 confirmed the bank would move elsewhere if separation brought ‘ extra difficulties ’ or cost pressures			1
in a chilling warning , he said that ‘ small countries do n’t often have big banks ’			1
the loss of one of the country ’s biggest companies would be an economic disaster , costing 14,000 jobs			1
if it did quit @entity5 , its mostly likely new home would be @entity25 , the financial capital of @entity27			1
could @entity3 walk out of @entity5 ? its chairman has warned that such a scenario is not out of the question as well as those based at @entity3 , it could also force the collapse of @entity5 firms that supply the @entity35 - based banking giant and are reliant on its business			1
the @entity3 , which includes @entity37 , has 26million customers in the @entity8			1
opponents said the comments put more pressure on the @entity42 to lay out the implications of independence for individuals and businesses			0
during an appearance in the @entity49 , sir @entity9 said the company had no current plans to move out of @entity5 , but admitted that the position could change after any referendum that led to the end of the @entity55			1
despite its headquarters being in @entity5 , sir @entity9 pointed out that only 3 - 4 per cent of the @entity3 ’s customers are in @entity5			1
he said that , should difficulties arise , it would have to reconsider its 300 - year connection with the country			0
he also called for more clarity on what would happen if @entity5 becomes independent			2
@entity65 sir @entity9 ( left ) said that if @entity5 independence caused the bank ' extra difficulties ' they would think about ' alternatives '			1
it was a veiled warning to @entity5 first minister @entity6 ( right ) @entity6 hit out at the @entity8 government today , claiming the ' complacency ' of chancellor @entity74 was the ' biggest danger to the economy '			2
he accused the @entity77 of ' basking in the @entity79 afterglow ' while it was ' still clear that what is needed is a direct capital investment stimulus to boost the economy '			0
mr @entity74 will deliver his autumn statement next month and mr @entity6 said the rising jobless figures meant it was ' ever more critical ' for him to ' take meaningful action to bring jobs and growth to the @entity8 economy '			0
mr @entity6 said : ' the biggest danger to the economy is the complacency of @entity74			0
' he should remember that the positive effect of the @entity79 on employment will only last a few months whilst the impact of the decisions he makes in this forthcoming autumn statement will last for years			0
' mr @entity6 said the number of people out of work and claiming benefits was ' unchanged ' across the @entity8 over the last year			0
he added : ' it is time the chancellor faced the reality that as a result of his decisions the @entity8 's economy is flat - lining			0
' it would be a tragedy for @entity5 , and for the @entity8 as a whole , if the positive impact of the @entity79 is used to justify continued inaction by the @entity77			2
' an extra £ 5billion in capital investment across the @entity8 would allow us to provide an additional stimulus of more than £ 400million to support employment in @entity5 now			2
' @entity5 office minister @entity115 said it was a ' cause for obvious concern that the latest @entity5 figures show another increase in unemployment while it is falling in the rest of the @entity8 '			2
sir @entity9 was giving evidence to the @entity124 , as part of its inquiry into the impact of @entity5 independence			1
he told peers : ‘ the overriding requirement is to serve our customers and to produce the best value we can for shareholders			0
' we have no intention or plan to relocate from @entity5			2
’ sir @entity9 said that even during the financial crisis the bank was ‘ happy to be domiciled in @entity35 ’ , but warned : ‘ if , as a result of independence , we found extra difficulties or cost pressures or whatever arising from that , then we would have to think about alternatives			1
’ the @entity77 , which owns 82 per cent of @entity3 , is almost certain still to have a large shareholding when the referendum takes place in 2014			2
that means that , if @entity5 vote yes , it would then be owned by a foreign government			2
under the @entity42 ’s current economic vision , an independent @entity5 would remain within a ‘ sterling zone ’ where the @entity153 would continue to be its ‘ lender of last resort ’			0
sir @entity9 admitted international money markets would be concerned about the issue , but pointed out that @entity3 received support during the banking crisis from foreign governments , including $ 90million from the @entity161			1
@entity42 claims that independence would significantly boost growth were dismissed by a senior @entity3 executive			0
giving evidence , head of group economic affairs @entity165 said independence or staying in the @entity55 would make little difference and would be ‘ economically neutral ’			0
a spokesman for the @entity172 campaign said : ‘ this is exactly why @entity6 needs to present exactly how independence will work			0
' we ca n’t wait until november next year for his much - heralded @entity175 to give the detail that individuals and businesses need			0
’ during a recent speech , former chancellor @entity179 accused mr @entity6 of ‘ cooking the books ’ on his arguments for separation			0
he also said that separating from the rest of the @entity8 could force some of @entity5 ’s financial giants to move out of the country			1
mr @entity179 said : ‘ @entity187 will damage business			0
sooner or later , a @entity5 firm with 90 per cent of its business somewhere else is going to ask itself : is staying worth the cost ? ’ a spokesman for finance secretary @entity194 said : ‘ sir @entity9 made it absolutely clear @entity3 ’ home is in @entity5 and will remain so			1
' there is no evidence to suggest an independent @entity5 will offer anything other than positive opportunities for all businesses , including the banking sector			0
’ an @entity3 branch in central @entity25 : the bank has been based in @entity5 for over 300 years , but only 3 - 4 per cent of its customers are there			1

@entity3 chairman sir @entity9 said bank would move elsewhere if separation brought cost pressures
