fat of the land : meat trader @entity9 , second left , has denied duping customers by selling tainted beef			1
also pictured is his former partner @entity27 , right , in this image from their daughter @entity31 's @entity30 page ‘ i bought @entity15 horsemeat , that ’s true , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ but that is what i sold to customers			2
it was clearly labelled , so i ca n’t be blamed for any later problem			2
’ however , in january last year , @entity9 was convicted of deliberately marketing @entity39 horsemeat as halal - slaughtered @entity3 beef and falsifying documents			1
he was alleged to have made £ 3.5 million from the fraud			0
@entity43 , @entity9 ’s lawyer in the @entity3 town of @entity45 , said his client had appealed against his conviction and so had yet to serve his one - year jail sentence			1
despite his conviction , @entity9 ’s company @entity49 – spelled backwards , it ’s the @entity3 word for horse – continued to trade in horsemeat and used the same cold - storage warehouse in @entity45 as part of his business with @entity19			1
@entity56 : @entity9 is believed to have set up his son @entity57 and his daughter @entity31 in business			1
their mother @entity60 is thought to have separated from @entity9 some years ago @entity62 , manager of the @entity64 cold - store warehouse , said all @entity9 ’s meat was clearly labelled			1
‘ it arrives to us as horsemeat and leaves us as horsemeat			2
’ according to a former colleague who spoke to him when the scandal erupted , @entity9 said he was astonished to be the focus of inquiries			1
‘ he said , “ do you think i ’d be dumb enough to get involved in something like this after all i ’ve been through ? ” ’ said the friend			0
@entity9 , who celebrates his 63rd birthday today , may deal in the increasingly murky world of the trans - @entity81 horsemeat trade , but his lifestyle is anything but grimy			1
he lives in considerable comfort in a £ 2.5 million gated mansion in @entity86 , a suburb of the @entity88 city of @entity89			0
a neighbour said @entity9 was often seen driving luxury cars			1
he is believed to have set up his two children , @entity57 and @entity31 , in business			0
their mother , @entity94 , is thought to have separated from @entity9 some years ago			2
@entity3 raid factory linked to @entity22 burgers @entity3 investigators were yesterday carrying out tests after raiding a meat factory in southern @entity101 suspected of mixing horseflesh with beef			2
they want to know whether horsemeat from the @entity106 plant in @entity107 was sold for human consumption as beef that may have been used in @entity22 burgers , pies and ready - meals			2
the country ’s food safety authority said it suspected the plant of buying horseflesh from @entity117 and mixing it with shredded beef before passing it off as 100 per cent beef			0
‘ that ’s the theory , ’ said @entity106 ’s lawyer @entity121 yesterday			0
‘ but the investigation is ongoing			0
’ the @entity3 public prosecutor said the probe into @entity106 , which employs about 100 staff at its beef butchery plant , also covered fraud and money laundering allegations			0
no arrests were made in friday ’s raid , which underlined @entity133 ’s role as a key distribution hub in the trade in horseflesh for the human food chain			0
probe : @entity3 investigators were yesterday carrying out tests after raiding the @entity106 meat factory in @entity107 where it is suspected that horseflesh was mixed with beef but finally there 's some good news about the horse meat scandal ! a mail on sunday investigation has found 28 meat products on sale in supermarkets and corner shops across the country to be free of horsemeat			2
dna tests were carried out by @entity154 , one of seven @entity22 official control laboratories			0
our shopping basket of goods – many from cheap or frozen ranges – also included chicken , lamb and pork items , to see if horse was being substituted for other meats besides beef			0
baby foods , celebrity - endorsed ready - meals , a cinema hot dog and a high street sandwich meal were also tested			0
the clean bill of health appears to tally with the first test results from the @entity176 announced on friday			0
then there were just 29 instances where more than one per cent of horse dna was found in 1,929 processed beef meals , and no evidence of any horse at all in 392 tests on raw beef samples .			0

@entity186 has insisted his horsemeat was clearly labelled
his customers include company which supplied beef for @entity6 lasagne
@entity9 convicted last year over marketing horsemeat as beef
