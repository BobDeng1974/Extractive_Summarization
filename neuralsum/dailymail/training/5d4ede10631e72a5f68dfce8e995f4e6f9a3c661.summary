scientists believe we are one step closer to creating an artificial mind			0
@entity4 has announced a new programming architecture for chips inspired by the human brain			1
the company claims the chips could pave the way for smart sensor networks that mimic the brain ’s capacity for perception , action , and thought			1
@entity18 - based @entity17 is planning to launch the first ever commercial chip inspired by the human brain			1
the chip 's memory functions as synapses would in the brain , the processors as neurons and communication as nerve fibres one day , it could allow computer scientists to develop a machine with a brain that is even more intelligent than that of humans			1
@entity4 ’s said its new programming architecture will allow developers to design applications for these brain - like chips once they released			1
‘ architectures and programs are closely intertwined and a new architecture necessitates a new programming paradigm , ’ said dr @entity39 , the principal investigator for the project at @entity41			2
‘ while complementing today ’s computers , this will bring forth a fundamentally new technological capability in terms of programming and applying emerging learning systems			0
’ the computers we use today were designed decades ago for sequential processing according to a pre-defined program			0
the brain consumes the same amount of power as a 20 watt light and occupies the volume of a two - litre bottle although they are fast and precise ‘ number crunchers , ’ our computers struggle to deal with real - time processing of the noisy , voluminous , big data produced by the world around us			2
in contrast , the brain - which operates comparatively slowly and at low precision - excels at tasks such as recognising , interpreting , and acting upon patterns			1
overall the brain , consumes the same amount of power as a 20 watt light bulb and occupying the volume of a two - litre bottle			2
a computer uses 99 per cent of its volume for cooling and powering , and only one per cent to process information in august 2011 , @entity4 demonstrated a building block of a novel brain - inspired chip architecture based on a scalable , interconnected , configurable network of ‘ neurosynaptic cores			1
’ the chip ’s memory functions as synapses would in the brain , the processors as neurons and communication as nerve fibres			0
these chips attempt to replicate and improve the brain ’s ability to respond to biological sensors and analysing vast amounts of data from many sources at once			2
to achieve this , the researchers developed a highly scalable functional software simulator of a cognitive computing architecture comprising a network of neurosynaptic cores			0
alongside this they created a digital neuron model which acts as the main information processing unit			0
the company claims that within this , a network of such neurons can sense , remember , and act upon a variety of different situations			0
@entity4 , in collaboration with @entity117 and @entity118 , has been awarded $ 12 million in new funding from the @entity120 ( @entity120 ) to advance the research for this part of the @entity123 ( @entity125 ) project			2
the project is part of the same research that led to @entity4 's announcement in 2009 that it had simulated a cat 's cerebral cortex , the thinking part of the brain , using a massive supercomputer			1
using progressively bigger supercomputers , @entity4 had previously simulated 40 per cent of a mouse 's brain in 2006 , a rat 's full brain in 2007 , and one per cent of a human 's cerebral cortex in 2009			1
eventually @entity4 wants to build a chip system with ten billion neurons and hundred trillion synapses			2
if you 've only just got used to talking to your phone , get ready for a major change			0
in december , @entity4 revealed its predictions for the computer we will all be using in 2018 - and it believes they will have all five senses , and will communicate with us in radically different ways			1
' infrared and haptic technologies will enable a smart phone 's touchscreen technology and vibration capabilities to simulate the physical sensation of touching something , ' the firm said			0
' so you could experience the silkiness of that catalog 's @entity165 cotton sheets instead of just relying on some copywriter to convince you			0
' it ’s amazing when you look back over the 60 + years of the computing revolution and see how far we have come in such a relatively short time , ' said @entity4 's @entity173 .			0

new programming architecture will allow developers to design applications for brain - like chips that are currently in development by @entity4
chips could lead to machine that have capacity for perception and thought
