frightened passengers held their heads and prayed as @entity10 , operating as a @entity11 , dropped nearly 30,000 feet in eight minutes and made an emergency landing in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the situation arose about an hour after take - off , when three passengers on the @entity19 175 twin - jet from @entity20 to @entity21 lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick			1
when the plane landed , @entity1 initially claimed that the aircraft landed ' out of an abundance of caution ' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane			1
late on wednesday , the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that ' a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight '			1
she said that the plane did not land because of just one person 's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell passenger @entity58 said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane ' nosedived ' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes ' you could feel something in the air , something just was n't right , ' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes			1
passenger @entity69 , right , said : ' a lot of people with their heads down praying			0
it just felt like a re-enactment ' emergency nurse , @entity47 , said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint			2
' the flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out			2
i had to sit down			0
i was short - of - breath , light - headed [ and ] did n't feel great , ' said @entity47 to @entity85			2

when the plane landed at 11.40am , the @entity91 issued a statement saying the crew ' reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency ' , shortly before landing in @entity13			1
however , in a second statement the @entity91 put out on wednesday afternoon , there was no mention of a ' pressurization ' issue			1
when contacted by the @entity103 to explain this , a spokesperson for the @entity91 would not say why the change was made			1
however , an official with knowledge of the incident told the @entity103 that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing ' rapid depressurization			0
' on landing this was declared untrue and @entity1 airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight			1
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity116 said : ' there were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent , but i ca n't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.

' there was no door flying open or anything like that			0
it was something very gradual			0
' @entity140 said that while the passengers were calm , he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made			2
' the way @entity1 is reporting it is that someone got sick , and they had to land , ' he told the @entity103			1
' but the way we understand it , they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane			0
' a nurse flying on the @entity19 twin - jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out			1
it was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks			0
' the passenger was lethargic			0
she was responding but her color was off			0
she did n't look good			0
we got her some oxygen			0
she was much more alert after getting the oxygen , ' the nurse , @entity47 , tells @entity85			0
