by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 21:41 est , 25 march 2013 regrets : @entity2 committed 30 drunken offences between the ages of 16 and 18 a young woman who was arrested 30 times for drunken attacks - including punching police officers - has warned against the dangers of binge drinking			1
@entity2 , from @entity11 , told closer magazine how alcohol transformed her from a shy schoolgirl into a violent criminal			1
she said : ' alcohol turned me into a crazed animal – i once punched a man in the face five times until he bled and enjoyed it			1
but i became addicted to the confidence alcohol gave me			2
' @entity2 , now aged 21 , started drinking when she was 14 blaming ' peer pressure ' from her older friends			1
as a teenager she would often drink four times a week , taking her weekly intake to 162 units - the recommended weekly intake for a woman is 14			2
on a typical night she would down a bottle of @entity34 , a bottle of @entity36 and 10 vodka shots			2
lacking in self - esteem as a teenager , she said the alcohol made her feel more ' confident and chatty ' and helped her ' fit in ' with her friends			0
however , it also led to her committing a number of violent offences			0
the first was when she attacked a police officer who tried to take a bottle off her when she was caught drinking in the street			1
she recalled : ' i bit her hand – i felt filled with rage and could n't stop myself			2
she handcuffed me and i was kept in a police cell for the night			2
' in the morning , i was horrified – i was a good girl , doing well at school and from a good family			0
i 'd never been violent before			0
' however , the incident was not enough to make @entity2 change her ways			1
in fact she said having a conviction for attacking a police officer was like ' a badge of honour ' as her friends thought it was ' cool '			1
hh out of control : on an average night she would consume a bottle of @entity34 , a bottle of @entity36 and 10 vodka shots she went on to commit a string of other drunken offences - around one a month - between the ages of 16 to 18 including punching other police officers , security guards and her friends			2
on one occasion , she viciously attacked a landlord who kicked her out of his pub for being under age			2
' i punched him in the face , five times			1
he was bleeding from the nose			0
i was like an animal , shouting and screaming			0
i was actually getting a thrill out of it , ' she said			0
@entity2 admits she was ' out of control ' and ignored the pleas from her ' angry and disappointed ' mother , @entity91 , 59 , a care worker , to give up alcohol			1
peer pressure : @entity2 said she drank to fit in with her older friends and feel more confident ( posed by models ) @entity2 shares her story in this week 's @entity97 the wake up call she needed only came after a five - and - a - half - month prison sentence she was given for punching another police officer in what was her 30th attack			1
upon her release in april 2011 , she had counselling and agreed to stop seeing her old friends			0
she now only drinks occasionally and volunteers in a clothes shop			0
she left school with six a to @entity111 grades and would love to get a full - time paid job but fears her criminal record will always hold her back			0
' my past will haunt me forever , ' she said			0
' i do n't know if i 'll ever work – i 'll be branded a criminal forever and it makes me feel worthless			0
' @entity2 is not alone in her teen addiction to alcohol as recent figures have revealed a surge in the number of girls under 15 consuming 11 units a week			1
there has also been a 50 per cent rise inthe past five years in fines issued to women under 21 for committing drunken violence			0
@entity2 now hopes other girls will learn from her story and change their ways			1
' i 'm embarrassed and ashamed of my past			0
binge - drinking might seem like fun , but it wrecks lives			1
' read @entity2 's full story in this week 's @entity97			1
