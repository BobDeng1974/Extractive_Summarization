@entity0 has called on everyone involved in the @entity2 to wear black for thursday 's first round as a mark of respect to the late @entity7			1
@entity8 caddie @entity7 died on sunday after suffering a heart attack while working for @entity11 's @entity10 in the final round of the @entity13 at @entity14			1
@entity0 was one of many players to criticise the decision to complete the tournament - which had already been reduced to 36 holes due to numerous weather delays - and is trying to organise his own tribute			1
in shock : @entity0 wants @entity2 participants to pay tribute to @entity7 ' in honor of an awesome man and a great caddie i want to promote the black color for all caddies , players and fans on thursday ... Â£ @entity32 , ' @entity0 wrote on @entity33			1
@entity34 winner @entity0 is one of four @entity36 players to taste victory on the @entity38 this season , with @entity40 defending his @entity42 title in december , @entity43 winning in @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46			1
but the 2008 rookie of the year - who celebrates his 31st birthday on thursday - has managed just one top - 10 since his victory , albeit a rather remarkable one in @entity50			2
@entity0 hit the headlines in the second round of the @entity53 last month when he shot a remarkable 68 despite having to dive into a lake after being attacked by hornets			1
swarmed : @entity0 was attacked by hornets in @entity58 and had to jump in a lake to escape them the incident happened on the fifth hole - @entity0 's 14th hole of the day - and after drying off and receiving treatment , he went on to birdie the par five and make another on the seventh			2
a closing 67 eventually gave him a share of eighth place			2
@entity43 is as short as 4/1 to win his second @entity2 title after finishing third in the @entity70 on sunday , but @entity72 's @entity71 will not be giving up his title without a fight			1
@entity75 , who won a record - equalling nine - hole play - off at @entity77 last year , said : ' it 's another course for us this year , but i 'm really looking forward to defending my title			2
" last year was a great win for me			0
it was a long nine hole play - off , so it was obviously very tough mentally and physically , but it finished well for me , which made it a little easier to recover from it			0
' when i won in @entity85 in 2005 it changed course the following year too , so i 've done it before			0
i 'm happy to go to @entity87 though			0
i 've not played the course much - only the year that @entity88 won ( 2009 )			0
' it 's a great venue and it is always nice to go as defending champion			0
you get a good draw and hopefully that will help me to continue the form i showed in @entity96			0
' it was a nice way to finish in @entity96 with a 66 and hopefully i will carry that on into the season in @entity99			0
it was great to have that round before i defend my title in @entity36			0
' high hopes : @entity72 's @entity71 is looking forward to defending his @entity2 title			1

@entity0 wants to *remember* @entity7 at @entity2
calls for all participants to wear black *armbands* to honour late caddie
@entity2 holder @entity71 in *confident* mood
