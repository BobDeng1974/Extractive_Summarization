@entity6 's friend , @entity59 , now eight , also testified , but only briefly to describe what the shooter was wearing			2

before she testified , @entity59 sat at the witness table sipping from a pink juice box			2
a loose head covering and a barrette held her dark brown hair out of her face			0

it provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and fractured his skull			0
@entity116 said the shooter had a gun and a light , but he could not identify the man			0

that boy , @entity148 , testified on saturday that an @entity42 had attacked them and put a gun in his sister 's mouth			2

he found his mother among the four corpses at the compound			0
' i just saw her , i cried , and i could not look on her face , ' he said			0
prosecutors said that in between his attacks , @entity55 woke a fellow soldier , reported what he 'd done and said he was headed out to kill more			1
the soldier testified that he did n't believe what @entity55 said , and went back to sleep			1
during cross-examination of several witnesses saturday , @entity55 ' attorney , @entity170 , sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have been more than one shooter			1
one @entity177 special agent testified that several months after the massacre , she took a statement from one woman whose husband was killed			2
the woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her husband out of the room and shot him , and the other held her back when she tried to follow			0
but other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter , and several soldiers have testified that @entity55 returned to his base at @entity195 , just before dawn , alone and covered in blood			1
a video taken from a surveillance blimp also captured a sole figure returning to the base			0
