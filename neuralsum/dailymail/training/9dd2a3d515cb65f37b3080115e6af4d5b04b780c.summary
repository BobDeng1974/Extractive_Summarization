by @entity0 published : 00:57 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 00:57 est , 24 october 2012 a woman was found guilty tuesday of disorderly conduct for berating security officers trying to pat down her teenage daughter and then refusing to submit to the procedure herself at a @entity8 airport			1
jurors deliberated four hours before convicting @entity10			1
she had faced up to 30 days in jail and a $ 50 fine for her conduct in the july 2011 confrontation at @entity15 , but the judge placed her on probation for a year because she has no criminal record			1
judge @entity19 , warned the 42 - year - old ' to be certain you do n't get into any further problems with the law			1
' charged : @entity24 has been found guilty with a year probation after refusing to let her child have a @entity28 pat - down @entity10 did n't talk to reporters outside the courtroom			1
her defense attorney , @entity31 , said she was disappointed in the verdict , but felt she got a fair trial			0
' she just wanted to stand on principle , because she felt that she had done nothing wrong , ' said @entity31 , who handled the case pro bono			0
' and i admire her for that			0
' the prosecution said @entity10 's behavior ' prevented others from carrying out their lawful activities , ' which is part of the definition of disorderly conduct under state law			1
@entity10 testified during the first day of the trial on monday that she was not unruly but did yell at officers			1
she said she was ' irritated , but not arguing			0
' however , assistant district attorney @entity51 said in closing arguments tuesday that @entity10 's behavior caused two security lanes to be halted and made a normally one - minute security check a 30 - minute ordeal			1
' the defendant should have been aware that her behavior would prevent others from carrying out their lawful activities , ' @entity51 said			0
@entity31 said his client may have been loud , but she was only exercising her right to free speech			0
' telling a police officer your opinion , even in strong language , to me that 's a @entity67 right , ' @entity31 told reporters			1
according to an affidavit , @entity10 first refused to allow her daughter - then 14 - to go through a body scan machine , saying she did n't want ' someone to see our bodies naked			1
' @entity10 and her daughter went through a metal detector and @entity28 officer @entity79 was sent to conduct a pat - down			1
@entity51 testified that before the pat - down , @entity10 yelled in her face that she did n't want anyone ' touching her daughter 's crotch			1
' @entity10 was accompanying her daughter to the gate but not flying herself			2
she eventually allowed her daughter to undergo the pat - down , but then refused one for herself			2
by that point , airport police officer @entity89 had been called and he testified that he asked her several times to calm down , but she would n't			2
guilty : @entity10 allegedly screamed at @entity15 security that she did n't want anyone touching her daughter 's private parts while going through a security check like this one ( file photo ) ' you 're not putting your ( expletive ) hands on me , this is ( expletive ) , ' he recalled @entity103 saying			1
@entity89 said he then arrested @entity10 , who he said continued to curse and call officers pedophiles			1
@entity10 had lived in @entity105 when she was charged and has since moved to @entity107			0
' she gave him no option , ' district attorney @entity51 said tuesday			0
' she put him in that position with her behavior			0
' during her testimony , @entity10 acknowledged that she did say a few curse words , but said she was n't in anyone 's face and had a ' normal conversation ' about what she believed to be inappropriate about the pat - downs			2
earlier tuesday , @entity31 used a surveillance video of what happened to support his claim that @entity10 was the one being yelled at and that she did n't create a distraction			2
the video , which did n't have audio , did show @entity89 speaking to @entity10 close up and making some hand motions			0
it also showed people walking around @entity10 and the officers			2
' it 's clear from the video ... she was n't preventing anything , ' @entity31 said			2
however , district attorney @entity51 said the video ' does n't tell the complete story of this case , ' which she said ' is not a free speech issue			0
' she said the officers reminded @entity10 several times that she could file a complaint if she had a problem with the security check proceedings			2
' you can speak your mind , but you ca n't do it in an illegal manner , ' she said			0
' what the defendant did was a crime			0
' the case briefly drew national attention as hundreds offered @entity103 support and donations amid debate over whether new , intrusive screening methods should be allowed at airports			0
' since 9/11 , we 're losing a lot of freedom , and we have to draw the line somewhere , ' @entity31 said in closing arguments .			0
