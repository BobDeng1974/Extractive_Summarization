by @entity0 last updated at 8:26 am on 26th january 2012 pricey : the right reverend @entity2 's home was bought and renovated by the church at a cost of more than £ 1m - and even has a special outhouse for bats senior bishops have been ordered to cut the lavish costs of running their palaces and mansions by more than a quarter			1
the spending cap , confirmed yesterday by @entity13 officials , will be lowered by a further third from 2014			2
the disclosure comes in a week that has seen five bishops lead a rebellion in the @entity18 against @entity19 plans to cap the cost of benefits payments			1
they are among the 44 diocesan bishops who are covered by the spending restrictions on accommodation , as are the @entity26 of @entity27 and @entity28			0
the five bishops opposed a £ 26,000 cap on benefits , claiming it would disproportionately affect families with children and make them homeless			1
@entity13 economist @entity39 said yesterday : ‘ now the @entity13 recognises that it has to live within its own budget , perhaps the bishops could recognise that the government needs to do the @entity37 bit of hypocrisy is it that they have trouble spelling ? ‘ if they are really worried about children , perhaps they should think of the children who will have to pay off the government ’s debts in 20 or 30 years ’ time			0
’ the bishops were also rebuked by former archbishop of canterbury @entity47 , who wrote in the @entity49 yesterday that they would doom families to remaining benefit - dependent and workless			2
dr @entity47 added that the bishops had ignored the impact of taxation on millions of working people who pay for state benefits but live on much less than £ 26,000 themselves			1
the bishop who led the rebellion – which also included the bishops of @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 – was the @entity65 , the right reverend @entity2			1
the style in which he is accustomed to living perhaps gives an insight into why he and his colleagues feel £ 26,000 a year is too little for a family to get by on			0
four years ago he moved into a house bought and renovated by the @entity13 at a cost of more than £ 1million			1
expenses included moving a colony of bats into a specially constructed outhouse run			2
all 44 bishops have now been told that the total maintenance and refurbishment bill for their homes must be kept below £ 5million a year for three years			2
the limit , which came into effect last year , is down from £ 7million a year over the previous three years			0
it is hoped the move will dispel the impression that senior clergy are enjoying lavish lifestyles at the expense of ordinary churchgoers			0
the cap means that average spending on a bishop ’s home will have to come down from just under £ 160,000 a year to £ 114,000			1
attack : @entity47 launched a rebuke against bishops who had voted against a cap on benefits at £ 26,000 in yesterday 's @entity49 this figure includes the cost of buying new homes and necessary repairs			1
but , according to @entity13 documents , ‘ the average ongoing maintenance costs of some houses is now well over £ 50,000 a year ’			0
papers circulated by the @entity13 ’s parliament , the @entity109 , reveal the findings of a meeting of senior figures staged by the @entity13 in 2009			0
it concluded : ‘ some very large sums have been spent on some of the properties recently and the average cost of maintaining each property was very high			0
’ the @entity13 then proceeded to plan a spending cap			0
synod secretary - general @entity119 set out the reasoning in a paper : ‘ there was recognition that the large sums spent on see houses provoked questions about the style , scale and expectations of bishops ’ ministry			2
’ successive attempts to curb bishops ’ extravagant spending on their ‘ see homes ’ have failed to slow the increase in costs			0
a church review a decade ago called for bishops to live in homes with no more than six bedrooms and to restrict their use of gardeners and chauffeurs			0
yet in the three years from 2008 to 2010 , spending on bishops ’ accommodation rocketed to £ 21million , or £ 7million a year			2
mr @entity119 proposed a total £ 15million spending cap over the 2011 - 2013 period , to be reduced to £ 10million for 2014 - 16			1
the reverend @entity147 , a @entity148 vicar and spokesman for the @entity13 ’s conservative evangelical reform group , said : ‘ everyone is having to cut their cloth and bishops are no different from the rest of us			1

bishops will face a *futher* cut of a third in 2014
right reverend @entity2 , who led *opposition* to benefits cap , has home that was renovated at cost of £ 1m - and even has an outhouse for bats
