the @entity0 refused on monday to formally call on @entity1 to throw their no. 3 in command , @entity3 , out of @entity0 leadership but repeatedly claimed it ' says a lot ' about the @entity7 that they would allow the @entity9 lawmaker to remain front and center			1
' who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity12 said			1
twice he referenced a comment @entity3 reportedly make nearly 20 years about being ' @entity23 without the baggage			0
' @entity25 is a former @entity27 leader and and heads the white supremacist group that @entity3 says he inadvertently spoke to a decade ago			1
house speaker @entity44 and @entity0 majority leader @entity45 came to @entity3 's defense last month as the conflict took shape , giving him the full weight of their support			0
incoming rep. @entity52 of @entity53 , the first black female to represent republicans in @entity55 , said sunday that she had no issues with @entity3			2
' i believe he should remain in leadership , ' @entity52 said on @entity61 ' sunday morning program @entity62			0
' there 's one quality that he has that i think is very important in leadership , and that 's humility			0
and he 's actually shown that in this case			0
' and he 's apologized , and i think that we need to move on and get the work of the @entity73 people done , ' she added			0
@entity9 's sole @entity75 representative , @entity74 , who is also black , has also backed @entity3			0
' i do n't think @entity3 has a racist bone in his body , ' @entity74 told @entity79 publication @entity80			0
but as members returned to @entity83 on monday and @entity7 prepared to take control of both chambers of @entity55 or the first time in eight years , the dust had yet to settle			1
the scandal bled into its second week on monday , with high - profile @entity75 doubling down on their denunciations of @entity3			0
' as the new @entity55 begins , nothing discredits @entity7 claims of outreach and bringing people together more than their decision to keep @entity3 at the top tier of the elected leadership of their caucus , ' @entity90 chair and @entity92 rep. @entity91 said in a statement			1
continuing , @entity91 said , ' anyone living in this century should have known better than to attend and speak at a white supremacist event , particularly one founded and led by @entity23 , and @entity3 ’s explanation that he was n’t aware is n’t credible by a long shot			1
' but when @entity0 @entity7 stand by him years later , and @entity7 @entity0 hopefuls defend or refuse to speak out , they legitimize his actions , ' she charged , calling on all potential @entity7 presidential candidates to ' publicly condemn @entity3			2
' i am not a racist : @entity0 majority whip @entity3 says he did n't realize that he was speaking to a white supremacist group when he gave the 2002 speech at the center of a scandal plaguing both him and the @entity7			1
but the @entity90 said on monday that ' anyone living in this century should have known better ' attacking newly elected @entity118 rep. @entity117 for his assertion sunday that the ongoing coverage of the @entity3 speech is the fault of the ' mainstream media who look for any opportunity to try to tear down republicans to help back up the @entity127 and the @entity75 in @entity55 , ' the @entity116 on monday called his decision to advocate for @entity3 ' mind - blowing			1
' ' @entity3 ’s ally @entity23 has attacked “ @entity131 ” as responsible for this negative story and the @entity133 says @entity25 is anti-semetic and that @entity3 had legitimized @entity25 ’s views by speaking there , ' the @entity116 said in a statement			2
the @entity116 's @entity137 said @entity117 ' chose to relentlessly defend his leader who trolls for votes at anti-semitic white supremacist rallies			2
' the @entity0 took a less aggressive approach at criticizing @entity3 on monday when responding to questions from reporters			0
' there is no arguing that who @entity7 decide to elevate into a leadership position says a lot about what the conference 's priorities and values are , ' @entity12 said in his first briefing of the @entity154			1
' we 've heard a lot from @entity7 particularly over the last few years , including the chairman of the @entity7 , about how @entity1 need to broaden their appeal to young people and to women , to gays and to minorities , that the success of their party will depend on their ability to broaden that outreach , ' he added			0
' so it ultimately will be up to individual @entity7 in @entity55 to decide whether or not elevating mr. @entity3 into leadership will effectively reinforce that strategy			1
' @entity12 would not explain what he meant when he stated numerous times that the @entity173 episode ' says a lot ' about the @entity7 , however , leaving reporters to draw their own conclusions .			2

' who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be , ' press secretary @entity12 said
@entity3 has since apologized for speaking to a white supremacist organization and claims he did n't realize it was a hate group at the time
but as members returned to @entity83 on monday and @entity7 prepared to take control of @entity55 , the dust had yet to settle
' anyone living in this century should have known better *...* and @entity3 ’s explanation that he was n’t aware is n’t credible by a long shot , ' @entity196 chair @entity91 said
