as i took a vaporetto from @entity4 @entity3 airport , i was stunned to see a huge grey submarine emerging from the lagoon			0
when the two vessels drew closer , i saw the unmistakable figure of @entity9 on board , waving frantically at me , surrounded by @entity12 naval officers			1
momentarily , i thought i might have to rescue @entity9 from his captors - then realised it was a stunt to promote his film @entity17 , a thriller set on a submarine			1
stars : @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 have all made recent appearances at the festival it was 1995 , and i was on my first visit to the @entity28 , held annually at the end of august on the sybaritic island of the @entity31 , with the lagoon on one side and the lapping waters of the @entity35 on the other			1
the film festival is the oldest , and arguably the most glamorous , in the world			1
it celebrated its 70th edition last year			0
remarkably , it makes little attempt to promote itself to the hordes of tourists who descend on @entity4 each summer			0
at the airport and on the mainland , in the vicinity of @entity48 's square and as far as the @entity49 , there are no posters for the festival and absolutely nothing to indicate that some of the planet 's biggest movie stars are in town			1
it is as if the city fathers have taken a vow of omerta , to allow the @entity12 cognoscenti to enjoy the pleasures of the festival to the exclusion of sweaty foreigners			1
boats and beauty : the @entity28 coincides with the colourful pageantry of the city 's @entity71 yet , unlike the @entity74 , where it is virtually impossible for ordinary mortals to attend the red -- carpet screenings , anyone can buy tickets to the premieres and galas at @entity4			1
they go on sale at the ticket booth on the @entity31 ( easily accessible by water - bus from the mainland )			1
i have rarely seen queues , as the booth is hidden away in the leafy shadows of the @entity92 building			0
at @entity4 the actors walk the red carpet , sign autographs and take photos with the fans			0
so even if you fail to get a ticket , a selfie with a movie star is a fair consolation prize			0
last year , the festival opened with the world premiere of sci - fi thriller gravity			1
stars can not arrive by limo at the @entity31			1
instead @entity21 arrived by water - taxi , accompanied by his co-star @entity22 and director @entity110			1
at the press conference , when asked how he prepared for the role of an astronaut , he joked : ' @entity22 and i did a lot of @entity117 yoga together			0
' afterwards , the gala dinner was in the magnificent setting of the sea - front @entity120 , in two large marquees on the beach			1
this hotel - a favourite of @entity125 when he served as jury president , the head of the panel judging the films - is the main hub of the festival , and the terrace is a wonderful place to enjoy a sundowner			1
light and shade : @entity21 ( left ; second left in shot , white shirt ) arrives in @entity4 by water - taxi during the 2013 festival ; @entity140 ( right ) , experiencing a darker side of @entity4 - as the setting for @entity143 many of the stars choose to stay in the more secluded @entity146 , located in the verdant @entity148 island			1
set primarily in a 15th century pastel - coloured building , it was opened in 1958 by @entity152			1
the story goes that @entity152 was inspired by the light of the late evening sun setting on the lagoon to create a cocktail that captured the colour of the sunset			0
and so the bellini was born , with its mixture of prosecco and peach puree			0
no visitor to the hotel would dream of ordering anything else in @entity168 , named after @entity152 's son			0
like the @entity171 , the @entity170 has its own private moorings , free water - boat shuttle service and a lovely restaurant , @entity175 , which faces the @entity176			1
it also has an olympic - size pool and delightful gardens			2
the notorious @entity180 lover @entity179 is said to have enjoyed many trysts there			0
it was here in this same garden , as the evening sunshine rippled through the trees , that i attended a dinner for that modern - day lothario , @entity23			2
he was starring in the @entity192 - directed movie @entity191			2
@entity192 , producer @entity193 , actor @entity194 and @entity196 director @entity195 were guests , and it was a relaxed affair , with @entity23 wearing his trademark shades through - out dinner			2
towards the end of the evening our host , an @entity12 media mogul , got up to toast @entity23			0
big names : @entity205 puts in an appearance at the 2004 festival ; @entity9 has also attended but he was so tipsy that he stumbled , barely managing to stay upright			1
as he stared blankly at @entity23 , it was clear he had momentarily forgotten @entity23 's name , so - flashing that famous grin - the actor came to his rescue by shouting : ' @entity23 ! ' every - one burst out laughing , and the media man looked relieved to have escaped a ' @entity215 ! ' scene			2
@entity217 films were well represented last year with the world premiere of @entity219 , attended by @entity220 and @entity221			0
they stayed at the 14th century palace in the gilded splendour of the @entity225 ( which also incorporates a 19th and @entity227 palace ) a few gondola - lengths from the @entity229			2
it is a hotel steeped in celluloid heritage , with @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , which starred @entity205 and @entity235 , being filmed there			1
the @entity240 , with its breathtaking views of the lagoon , is probably the most popular spot in @entity4 for marriage proposals			0
last year , the hotel terrace played host to a lavish party thrown in honour of that year 's jury president , @entity247 , the @entity248 - winning director of @entity249			2
the theme was @entity247 's greatest hits so , showing a strange sense of humour , the hotel 's chef had arranged for the butter to be sculpted in homage to @entity259 's famous sex scene in @entity260			0
one enormous film set : @entity262 and @entity263 ( right of shot ) filmed the climax of @entity233 in @entity4 if cinema does not float your boat , the festival coincides with two spectacular events - the @entity71 and the unmissable arts and architecture extravaganza , the @entity274			1
@entity4 has hosted the @entity71 , the historic ceremonial pageant and gondola race down the @entity176 , since 1315			0
on the first sunday of september , thousands congregate to catch a glimpse of the beautiful boats and the brightly coloured participants who compete in traditional @entity180 costumes for hotly contested prizes of pennants and the title @entity285			0
@entity287 has changed since @entity288 painted the scene in 1740 - apart from pollution			2
pity any gondolier who falls into the water			0
when filming @entity295 's @entity294 , @entity293 had to fall into the canal backwards			0
she suffered a chronic eye infection for the rest of her life which she blamed on the @entity180 waters			0
one of the best places to watch all the regatta action is the terrace of the @entity304 , where @entity305 threw her party to celebrate the premiere of her film about @entity309 , @entity310 above the terrace , the love scenes from the iconic @entity180 thriller @entity143 , starring @entity314 and @entity140 , were shot			2
worth exploring is the 13th century church of @entity317 ( @entity318 of the @entity319 ) , which @entity314 's character is restoring in the film			0
stars of a different kind : characters from the big hit @entity325 pose in a water taxi at the @entity120 it is situated in the tranquil quarter of @entity329 - and its shady courtyard , overlooking a little canal , provides a welcome respite from the tourists and the scorching sun. the success of the movie helped the church raise the funds necessary to restore it			1
a popular restaurant with festival - goers is @entity342 on the romantic island of @entity344 , the first @entity180 island to be inhabited , and still blissfully peaceful , with sheep often wandering around its pretty town square			1
the island features in @entity349 , @entity351 's play about marital infidelity ( inspired by his own real - life affair with @entity354 )			2
the restaurant garden is the scene of many marriage proposals - but if the big question fails to materialise over a meal there , in the nearby cathedral courtyard is a stone throne , supposedly built by @entity363			2
legend has it that whoever sits on it will be married within a year			0
@entity179 would have run a mile			0
this year 's festival opens on august 27 with the world premiere of @entity371 , starring @entity372 and @entity373			1
in this era of perpetual change , there is something life - affirming about the old - world glamour of the @entity28			1
with its selection of cinema from all over the world , it is following in the best traditions of @entity4 's favourite son , the renowned adventurer @entity3			0
if he were alive today , it is surely a festival he would want to explore			2
@entity388 is a film producer whose movie @entity389 won @entity390 at @entity4			0
@entity391 ( @entity392 , 020 7593 2283 ) offers a range of luxury breaks to @entity4 during the film festival			1
prices start at Â£ 1,325 per person for four nights at the @entity399 , including return @entity401 flights from @entity403 , @entity405 accommodation , water - taxi transfers , entrance to the @entity408 and guide notes , plus concierge service .			2
