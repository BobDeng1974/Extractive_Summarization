by @entity0 the love of horseracing is ingrained in the culture and history of @entity5 unlike almost anywhere else in the world			2
but the toll of horses who die or are destroyed on racecourses each year is leading to a wave of public disgust			1
a race meeting held a fortnight ago saw hired @entity15 - a seven - year - old gelding - die at @entity17			1
earlier this year the @entity18 asked jockeys to slow down to cut the number of injuries and deaths to horses during the historic race he became the 1,000th horse to die on a racecourse since @entity28 began their @entity29 in 2007			1
animal rights campaigners say the sport is exacting is a dreadful price on the horses that compete in it and are questioning whether it is a price worth paying any longer			1
they say that while the sport is undoubtedly popular - attracting millions of people each year - punters should be more aware of the suffering it causes the horses			1
animal rights campaigners say that while the sport is undoubtedly popular punters should be more aware of the suffering it causes the horses @entity46 , @entity28 ‘ s horseracing consultant , said : ‘ if horses are to die so that someone can enjoy a bet , punters should be aware of a basic truth			1
and this is that betting on horses means horses will suffer and die			2
’ earlier this year the @entity18 made history after jockeys were urged to slow down to cut the number of injuries and deaths to horses during the historic race			1
the instruction was one of a series of measures introduced after the death of one race favourite , @entity70 , as well as according to @entity71 , in the 2012 event led to a major outcry from the watching public and animal welfare charities			1
animal rights campaigners say the sport is exacting is a dreadful price on the horses that compete in it and are questioning whether it is a price worth paying any longer and the @entity81 says the horse race has to change if it is going to survive			1
@entity83 , chief executive of the @entity81 , said the @entity18 is on ‘ trial			1
’ he added : ‘ i simply do n’t think the public will tolerate another @entity18 like the ones we ’ve had the last few years			1
’ in the event two horses - @entity87 and @entity89 - died during the three - day meeting at @entity92 this year			1
@entity28 says 10 horses died or were destroyed on @entity5 racecourses in the space of a month this year			2
23 july @entity96 was destroyed after being injured at @entity17 ; sunglasses was destroyed after breaking a hind leg at @entity99			1
20 july @entity100 was destroyed after falling and being injured at @entity101			0

26 june @entity117 died after falling at @entity118			0
24 june @entity119 collapsed and died after a race at @entity121			2
around 17,500 horses competed on racecourses in @entity5 last year while around 6,600 – 38 per cent – are calculated to have participated in jump racing			2
an estimated 157 horses died as a result of jump racing last year and @entity28 claims that this equates to a one in 42 chance of a jump horse dying over the course of a year			2
but the @entity132 fiercely rejected the claims , pointing out that horses were raced several times a year			0
@entity28 ’s figures show that the @entity137 racecourse topped the league for the highest number of horses killed since 2007 with 42 animals			2
it is followed by , @entity142 on 44 , @entity101 , 40 , @entity106 , 32 , and @entity92 with 31			0
however the true number of deaths is suspected to be significantly higher			0
the @entity145 ( @entity132 ) confirmed in response to a recent parliamentary question that there were 162 more equine fatalities over the past three years than @entity28 has recorded			0
but a @entity132 spokesman said : ‘ @entity151 is a sport that carries risk , and @entity5 racing is honest and open about the risks involved			0
‘ @entity5 racing is very proud about the welfare standards which are required in the sport – in which we are considered world leaders – and has nothing to hide			0
’ last week @entity28 wrote to @entity161 , minister at the @entity162 , calling for the @entity132 to publish the full data on recorded horse deaths			0
it said : ‘ given the special place that horses have in @entity5 culture , such a national discussion would be very much in the public interest			0
we urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that all such relevant information is placed in the public domain			0
