they accuse him of siding with protesters rallying against cop violence opposition : after the deaths of the two police officers , @entity98 users suggested @entity0 's opposition to the cops was responsible for the killings , including former @entity1 governor @entity104 , pictured fallout : police commissioner @entity70 ( right ) has said attitudes towards the police mirror those in the 1970s			1
@entity18 ( left ) has now called upon protesters to stand down until after the officers ' funerals two union leaders also said the mayor had ' blood on his hands ' for the officers ' deaths			1
former @entity38 detective @entity118 even compared him to ' @entity120 ' as he spoke to page six			2
' he 's tall and he 's silly and he does n't know what he is doing , ' he said			2
' he knows nothing about policing			0
he knows nothing about " stop and frisk "			0
' on monday , @entity70 told the today show that tensions are as bad as the 1970s , when @entity1 was rocked by racial clashes and 60 officers were killed in the line of duty			2
by monday evening , @entity0 reinforced @entity70 's call for protesters to stand down until after the funerals for the slain @entity46 officers			1
' it 's a time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time , ’ he said said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the @entity38			2
the plea fell on dead ears			0
@entity38 officers : the gunman fired a fatal round of bullets at @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) condolences : @entity18 and @entity70 visited the home of @entity84 to pass on their condolences on monday civil rights activists , led by @entity66 , were quick to dismiss @entity0 's request and vowed to carry on protests stemming from the decisions of the grand juries not to indict police officers			1
' it 's a time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time , ’ @entity0 said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the @entity38			1
@entity66 , who joined @entity54 's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers , said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of @entity54 's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family 's first @entity178 without him			1
on the other side of the tension , rank - and - file officers took to social media sites and message boards to express their frustration with the mayor			1
on sites like @entity189 and @entity190 , officers wrote anonymous posts calling on @entity0 to stay away from the slain cops ' funerals			1
support : on tuesday morning , @entity0 and his wife , @entity195 , visited a makeshift memorial near the site where the officers were murdered in the @entity200 area of @entity46 on saturday ' a little too little			1
a little too late , ' wrote user @entity201			0
' i am wondering if he feels that it is worth a confrontation showing up to a funeral no one wants him at			0
' another user , otjkid , ranted at the mayor : ' back peddling too late			0
all of sudden you support us with 400 million dollars for what ? cameras lol			0
' killer : @entity216 , 28 , shot dead the police officers and then took his own life in the subway but @entity220 , @entity221 's longtime adviser , told @entity17 that @entity0 's struggle between speaking the truth to the police while also wanting to hold his power is not a new problem			1
' my sense is that he sincerely appreciates both the hard job the police do and the gulf that exists today , and is trying to close that breach , ' @entity220 said			2
' and he has to weather the storm and speak hard truths to police and the community and over time , the public will appreciate his role as a rational voice , trying to heal the city and move forward			2
' others told the publication that the mayor ' does n't have a clue ' - citing his relationship with @entity67 staffer @entity246 , whose son and boyfriend posted anti-police remarks on @entity250			2
even when the comments emerged - as well as the fact her boyfriend had tried to drive a police officer off the road in @entity257 - the mayor stood by her			2
she eventually left the job			0
' his words and his deeds do n't match , ' said veteran cop reporter @entity263			0
' you had @entity246 's son calling cops ' pigs ' and @entity0 does n't think that 's inappropriate ? what message are you sending ? ' @entity18 says it 's just the union guys who are angry			1
i 've been covering this for 25 years and i have never seen anything like it … the mayor does n't have a clue			0
' a message to @entity1 over the past weeks , many in this city and across the nation have been attempting to define the @entity38 in their own terms			0
they are attempting to answer for themselves questions about who we are , what we do , and how we do it			0
but the men and women of this @entity38 know exactly who we are : we are police officers @entity83 and @entity84			1
they were loving fathers , husbands , and sons — points of great pride for their communities			0
they were also part of our @entity38 family , bonded by the experiences , triumphs , and challenges we face so that others wo n’t have to			0
they dedicated their lives to the defense of others , and understood what that commitment could ultimately mean			0
they were people of faith , of conviction , and of principle			0
they answered the call to service , and did so each and every day they wore the uniform			0
they were devoted to the protection of this city and the safety of its people			0
they did n’t do this work to be thanked , congratulated , or admired			0
they did it because it must be done , because we all have the basic right to live free from fear			0
and with all of us , they stood tall to guard those who can not guard themselves , to shield the frightened , the weak , and the vulnerable			0
these deaths cast a dark cloud on the rest of our holiday season and the flags will remain at half - staff past @entity178			2
but as we mourn their sacrifice , we also honor them through the work we do every day			0
may @entity349 grant officer @entity83 and officer @entity84 rest			1
and may @entity349 bless the @entity38			0
