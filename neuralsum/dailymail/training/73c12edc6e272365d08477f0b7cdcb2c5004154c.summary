by @entity1 reporter from slipping into a bikini to pulling on your dream wedding dress , losing weight is easy when you 've got a goal in mind			2
but for full - time mother , @entity9 , 26 , from @entity10 , it was the promise of a boob job that helped her shed more than half her body weight			1

' it was such a kind gesture , ' reveals a thrilled mrs @entity9			1
' @entity28 just wanted to see me healthy but he knew i never managed to stick to the diets for long and so he offered me the surgery as a prize because he knew it would keep me motivated			2
' i ca n’t thank him enough because not only did it mean i finally lost the weight , but i ’m also confident with my bust too			2
' for the first time ever i finally like what i see in the mirror and i ca n’t thank my dad enough because there is no greater prize than health and happiness			1
' unhealthy : @entity9 's problems began after the birth of son @entity46 , now six , when she was diagnosed with @entity47 concerned : father @entity23 was so worried about her 17st 8lb bulk , he offered to pay for a boob job getting better : @entity9 embarked on a healthy eating plan and the pounds soon began to fall off mrs @entity9 's battle with her weight began when she was 20 following the birth of her second son @entity46 , now six			1
already a mother to @entity57 , now eight , she succumbed to severe postnatal depression and her weight rocketed			1
' i ’d always been about a size 12 but after having @entity46 , instead of getting smaller , i just got bigger and bigger , ' explains mrs @entity9			1
despite vowing to lose the four stone she ’d gained during the pregnancy , after the birth she quickly gained another three thanks to her penchant for chocolate and fizzy drinks			2
' i was diagnosed with @entity47 and turned to chocolate and sugary drinks to try and give myself a quick boost of energy because i felt so lethargic all the time , ' she reveals			1
' i was soon trapped in a vicious cycle and because i hated the way i looked so much i binged on more sweets and chocolate to feel better			0
’ when her relationship with the children ’s father ended , she grew even more depressed and began to see food as a crutch			0
' i ’m so short that i looked like a cannon ball , ' she remembers			0
' all the weight seemed to go to my stomach			2
’ so pronounced was her tummy , mrs @entity9 regularly found herself being asked , much to her embarrassment , whether she was pregnant again			1
' a friend pointed to me tummy and asked when i was due , ' she remembers			0
' i just shook my head and made a joke of it			0
it was n’t her fault			0
' i was so fat i did look pregnant			0
i think she was more embarrassed than me			0
’ mrs @entity9 's weight peaked at 17st 8lbs , 18 months after her son was born , but at just 5ft 1ins tall , she soon began to suffer pins and needles in her hands and feet - a consequence , her doctor told her , of being morbidly obese			1
' i ’d buried my head in the sand , ' says mrs @entity9			1
' i had no idea i had gotten that big - i had been kidding myself because it was easier not to face the truth			2
now it was beginning to have an impact on my health			0
' and mrs @entity9 was n't the only one to worry			1
her father @entity23 , the manager of a chemical plant , was also concerned			1
happy : a size 14 when she met husband @entity112 , 31 , she was a svelte size 8 by the time they married in @entity116 almost there : by june 2013 , @entity9 had hit her target weight and the same month , had her £ 4,000 boob job overjoyed : @entity9 says she now has the body she 's always dreamed of and is thrilled ‘ i knew @entity28 was worried about me , ' remembers mrs @entity9			1
' he had been dropped gentle hints about me losing weight but only because he wanted me to be healthy			0
' he was worried about me and he knew i would never be happy again unless i lost weight			0
’ despite trying a litany of different diets , mrs @entity9 's weight problems continued			1
compounding her misery was the fact that when she did lose a few pounds , they always seemed to go from her bust			2
' one day i was moaning to my sisters about the fact that the only part of me that looked ok was my bust and that if i lost weight it would be the first thing to go , ' says mrs @entity9			1
' @entity28 overheard and promised that if i did lose all the weight he would pay for surgery on my bust			1
it meant i had no excuse anymore			0
' excited at the prospect to surgery , mrs @entity9 swung into action , swapping unhealthy takeaways for grilled meat and salad , while fizzy drinks were exchanged for water and green tea			2
‘ @entity28 assured me he meant what he had said and that really kept me motivated , ' says mrs @entity9			2
' it almost felt like a competition because there was such a wonderful prize in sight			0
' @entity28 knew as a mother of three i could never afford surgery myself			0
’ she had already shrunk to a size 14 when she met her now husband @entity161 , 31 , a landscape gardener , in 2010 and continued to follow her healthy eating plan when she became pregnant with her youngest son @entity163 , now three			0
' obviously i gained baby weight but because i was losing fat through healthy eating , one balanced out the other , ' says mrs @entity9			1
' my gp monitored me throughout and was perfectly happy there was no risk at all to my baby			0
' after the birth , she began running three times a week and working out at the gym			0
and when she married in september 2012 in @entity116 , she was a slender size 8			1
but much to her horror , her once voluptuous bust had shrunk to a tiny @entity179			0
' i hated them , ' adds mrs @entity9			2
' i even had special cups fitted into the dress to try and add some shape			0
' by june 2013 , mrs @entity9 hit her target weight of 8st and was duly given her reward , having surgery at the transform clinic in @entity188 the same month			1
' it had been a long process to lose the weight so i ’d had plenty of time to research the procedure and it ’s not a decision i took lightly , ' she explains			1
' losing the weight had left me with nothing at all			0
i just wanted to look natural			0
’ her £ 3,995 prize increased her assets to a @entity202 and father @entity203 says it was worth every penny to finally see his daughter happy and more importantly healthy again			0
' @entity28 raised my three siblings and me by himself so we were already very close but what he has done means the world to me , ' adds mrs @entity9			1
‘ i definitely have the best dad in the world			2
