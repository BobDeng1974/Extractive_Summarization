by @entity0 @entity1 has already taken its first steps into the world of wearables - with its gear range of smartwatches - and rumours suggest it ’s gearing up to launch a @entity9 rival in the autumn			1
these reports were bolstered this week by a @entity1 patent that not only hints at an upcoming wearable device – it details a system in which wearers could turn their hands into the keyboard			1
in the proposed system , people wearing a camera - on a @entity9 - style device dubbed @entity20 - would be able to look down at their hands , which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard , and use their thumbs to select the keys			1
the patent was filed in 2013 to the @entity26			1
in the proposed system , people wearing a camera - on a @entity9 - style device , dubbed @entity20 - would be able to look down at their hands , which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard , and use their thumbs to select keys , pictured in the proposed system , people wearing the camera - on a @entity9 - style device dubbed @entity20 - would be able to look down at their hands , which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard			1
for example , numbers could be assigned to a forefinger , while symbols could be assigned to a middle finger			0
alternatively , letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to bottom			0
users would then use their thumb to ' press ' the various keys on both hands			0
the camera would capture the movement of the thumb , or identify the force pressed onto each finger to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly			1
the patent was filed in 2013 to the @entity26 as well as @entity60 ’s @entity59 , and was found by @entity61			1
it relates to ' an input apparatus and method for providing a camera - assisted input operation for use in a portable device			2
' ‘ recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses - type terminal and wristwatch terminals , ’ continued the patent			2
‘ such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen			0
' the system involves a camera for capturing an image , a storage unit that stores the ‘ key to hand mapping table ’ , a display and a control unit			0
numbers could be assigned to a forefinger , for example , while symbols could be assigned to the middle finger			0
alternatively , letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to bottom			0
for example , numbers could be assigned to a forefinger , middle finger and closed fist , pictured , while symbols could be assigned to a little finger			0
alternatively , letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm , from left to right and from top to bottom the proposed system involves a camera for capturing an image , a storage unit that stores the ‘ key to hand mapping table ’ , pictured left , a display and a control unit			1
this table would then be mapped onto the wearer 's actual hand			1
wearers would then use the table as a guide on the glasses ' display to type their message users would then use their thumb to ‘ press ’ the various keys on both hands			2
the camera would capture the movement of the thumb , or identify the force pressed onto each finger , to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly			2
reports in @entity141 in january were the first to suggest @entity1 is working on a @entity9 rival			2
the article explained the @entity20 would sync to a smartphone and let the wearer make and receive calls , and listen to music			0
this makes it simialr to how the @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 smartwatches work .			0

the patent was filed in 2013 to the @entity26
it details a virtual keyboard displayed via a @entity9 - style device
@entity162 - mounted camera maps the keys to the wearer 's fingers and palm
