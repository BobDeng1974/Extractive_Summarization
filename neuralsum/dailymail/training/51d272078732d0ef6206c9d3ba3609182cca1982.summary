' it is much more interesting and challenging to represent a complex set of feelings by framing the model 's hair and shoulders in a proper - suggestive , dreamy or even scary and nightmarish - background , instead of simply and plainly picturing her expression			0
' this also leads the watcher to actively focus on what the photo makes her / him feel - and possibly to imagine what the photographer 's and the model 's feelings may have been - instead of passively admire or dislike the final result of the photographer 's work - just as straight portraits usually do			0
