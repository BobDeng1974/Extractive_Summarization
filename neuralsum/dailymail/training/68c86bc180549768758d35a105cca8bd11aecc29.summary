by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 12:05 est , 11 january 2014 restrained : the mayor of @entity3 said firearms officers had attended 10,000 incidents in the last four years @entity6 praised @entity8 ’s armed police units as ‘ fantastically restrained ’ yesterday			1
the mayor of @entity3 said firearms officers were deployed to around 10,000 incidents over the last four years , and only fired their weapons on six occasions			1
mr @entity6 was among several senior political figures who rallied round the @entity13 following the @entity15 inquest verdict			1
@entity16 appealed for a calm response from family and supporters to the verdict that @entity15 was lawfully killed by a police marksman			1
the prime minister said he hoped people would respect the ‘ proper judicial process ’ and welcomed the stance taken by @entity15 ’s aunt @entity26 , who said she wanted ‘ no more violence ’			2
mr @entity16 also backed a proposal to make armed officers wear cameras and microphones to record their actions			1
‘ we have to respect judicial processes in this country , we have to respect the outcome of trials and the work that juries do , ’ the prime minister told @entity34			0
‘ i very much respect @entity43 ’s aunt for saying they want to pursue their case through the courts rather than on the streets , i think that ’s absolutely right			0
’ mr @entity16 acknowledged there was still some racial prejudice in the @entity51 but said efforts were being made to ‘ break down the barriers ’			2
he said : ‘ we are on a journey , we have n’t cracked all these problems			0
there is still racial prejudice , there is still discrimination			0
‘ but i think what you can see is governments of all colours , whether @entity64 or @entity65 , have been trying to break down these barriers and try to make sure that people are valued for the passion in their heart and the thoughts in their head rather than the colour of their skin or their sexuality			0
protection : @entity16 called for armed officers to wear cameras and microphones on duty ‘ we have made huge progress over the years but there is always more to do			1
’ mr @entity6 expressed his sympathy for @entity15 ’s family , but emphasised the ‘ incredible pressure ’ under which armed police operate			1
‘ on any given day highly trained @entity13 firearms officers can and do face life - threatening situations in which they have to make instant judgements under incredible pressure , ’ the mayor said			1
deputy prime minister : @entity92 said there were ' questions to be asked ' about how investigations into police shootings are handled ‘ our police were deployed to armed responses about 10,000 times in the last four years , and only on six occasions have they actually fired their weapons , discharged police weapons			1
‘ no police operation begins with the intention of ending with the loss of life of a member of the public			2
and i just would stress that if you look at how our police operate they are fantastically restrained , and those split - second decisions are all the more difficult if someone is clearly carrying a lethal weapon			2
’ however , a leading government crime adviser blamed the police reaction to the shooting for widespread riots in @entity3 in 2011			2
@entity119 , a former aide to @entity16 , said their failure to speak directly with the @entity15 family , coupled with the mixed messages coming out of @entity8 in the aftermath of the killing , made people take to the streets across the country			1
‘ they should have had one very senior officer , who was speaking to the @entity131 and the public alone , and not had all these different conflicting stories coming out , ’ he said			0
‘ they should have gone straight to the family and dealt with the family directly – that ’s the kind of thing that started the riot , and not the fact that @entity43 had been shot			0
’ @entity92 said there were ‘ questions to be asked ’ about how investigations into police shootings are handled			0
the deputy prime minister said that while he ‘ totally understood ’ the angry reaction to the finding in some quarters , he wanted to stress that the case had been considered by a jury			0
he said : ‘ this is a jury made up of people randomly selected just like anyone else who has been called up for jury service			0
‘ it is not the police acting as judge and jury			0
