last year , 18 - year - old college freshman @entity10 was driving to @entity11 , @entity12 when he stopped at the scene of a roadside accident to help a stranded woman			1
according to mother @entity17 and father , also named @entity10 , this was typical behavior for their son			1
good samaritan : @entity10 was tragically killed a year ago while trying to help a woman stranded along the side of the road noble death : just as @entity25 ( left ) died trying to help someone , he also helped people in his death , like 69 - year - old @entity29 , who now has @entity25 's heart pumping inside him ‘ he died a noble death , ’ said @entity10			1
as he helped the woman , the younger @entity10 was struck and killed by a passing truck , while the woman he sought to help survived			1
and so , thanks to @entity10 , did three other men			1
these are the people with whom @entity10 and @entity17 chose to spend the one - year anniversary of their beloved son ’s death			1
trying to heal : @entity25 's father , also named @entity10 ( right ) listened his son 's heart as it beat inside 69 - year - old @entity29 better times : as the recipients of @entity10 's organ 's gathered with their families and with @entity10 's , @entity10 's mother @entity17 told stories about her beloved son in attendance were the three men saved by @entity53 's organs as well as their grateful families			1
thanks to one of @entity10 ’s kidneys , a man named @entity56 was able to attend the event			1
‘ even though that truck may have hit that kidney , it ’s working fine ’ @entity56 said to the laughs of a room everyone in the room			2
@entity67 and @entity29 were also able to attend			0
celebratory : @entity25 smiles with her son 's organ recipients @entity67 ( center ) and @entity56 ( right ) happy families : rather than a day of sorrow , the @entity74 celebrated the many people their son helped live barns received @entity53 ’s pancreas and other kidney while 69 - year - old @entity81 received his young heart			0

‘ first thing i told her , ’ @entity29 told @entity89 while holding back tears , ‘ is i do n’t feel worthy			0
he was such a good kid with his whole life ahead of him			0
’ bittersweet : ' he died a noble death , ' said @entity25 's father , pictured with his two sisters and mother though @entity25 died while being the good samaritan his parents say he was his whole life , it is a happy irony that he helped so many people after his own death			2

' we ’ve been at the threshold , on the door of despair , ' @entity10 said			2
' but never entered in			0
we ’ve always been at peace			0
