by @entity0 @entity2 's players have been getting to know new boss @entity3 and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits			1
here , @entity6 has exclusive extracts from @entity0 's explosive new book on the @entity9 which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at @entity13			1
the @entity13 dressing room has superstars and superstars have egos			1
but @entity2 players are about to learn that @entity3 is big enough to take on any truculent star who thinks he is bigger than the club			1
born winner : @entity3 celebrates @entity24 's @entity23 title victory back in 2010 first leg : @entity26 looks bemused at @entity28 's antics while @entity29 smiles at the crowds superstars : the @entity2 squad are set to learn that @entity28 is capable of taking on the biggest egos for the @entity9 , moving into @entity2 will be a re-run of when he was made manager of @entity37 giants @entity24			1
@entity28 spent four months fighting to impose his will on a dressing - room full of big - name players who thought they had a divine right to wear the shirt			1
volatile @entity44 striker @entity43 , one of those who fell out with the forthright coach , revealed just how far @entity28 went to show who was in charge			0
‘ i remember how he once tried to make it clear that he was n’t afraid to withdraw the so - called big names , ’ @entity43 said			1
‘ he just dropped his trousers to show us that he had the b * * * s to do so			2
’ @entity54 in 2009 sounds much like the remit for @entity2 now : a big club fallen on bad times ; huge expectation but fear of failure ; taking over from a manager who had been in charge for less than a year			1
@entity2 fans should be warned that if he follows the same blueprint , and he probably will , expect things to get worse before they get better			1
@entity28 ’s start at @entity54 was so poor and so disruptive that by late october he was one game from the sack			0
yet he survived , and finished that first campaign by winning the @entity23 and @entity72 double as well as getting to the @entity74 final			0
@entity54 were in a mess when he arrived after the 300 - day reign of @entity77 and @entity28 was seen as the saviour , just as he is in @entity79 after @entity81 ’ failure			2
hard at work : @entity83 is put through his paces during @entity2 training in @entity86 on monday fall - out : @entity43 ( right ) recalls one occasion at @entity54 when @entity28 dropped his pants to prove a point he announced himself at his first press conference by reciting the club ’s motto : ‘ @entity93 ’ ( we are who we are ) and asserting : ‘ i am who i am : confident , dominant and honest ; a workaholic , innovative but also warm and family friendly			1
’ few agreed with the second part of that statement as he set about imposing his plans			0
within days of taking over , he made it clear that defender @entity102 , captain of @entity104 ’s national team and a first choice at @entity24 for five years , did not fit into his plans and sold him to @entity108			1
he continually left out @entity26 , the @entity109 12 months earlier , because he did n’t agree with @entity28 ’s plan to play him as a no 10 , preferring to stay on the left wing			2
it took @entity28 10 matches of tinkering before he settled on a preferred line - up , during which time the team seemed rudderless and the coach ’s credentials were questioned			1
for the first four months he and @entity24 looked incompatible			1
there was speculation that he would be sacked if @entity24 could n’t beat @entity120 in late october			1
with four minutes left and the score 1 - 1 , @entity28 replaced @entity43 with defender @entity122 and moved centre - half @entity123 up front			2
a home crowd of 69,000 whistled and jeered but two minutes later @entity127 headed in @entity129 ’s cross			0
it proved one of several season - defining moments			2
the tensions in a frustrated team regularly bubbled to the surface , and sometimes spilled into public view , such as when @entity43 was substituted at half - time in a game against @entity139 and the @entity44 promptly went home			1
success : @entity28 took ten games to settle on a preferred line - up before leading @entity24 to the title as one of the mutineers who could n’t get on with @entity28 , he was given short shrift			1
‘ we have rules and we have to work within the rules , ’ said the coach			0
every player , whether he is a world champion or whatever , has to accept he does not always play			0
@entity26 said that the coach ’s philosophy was hard to understand			0
‘ in training no - one is laughing			2
everything is too serious , ’ he said			0
defender @entity158 gave an interview in which he criticised everything from the club ’s transfer policy to tactics			0
@entity28 ’s time at @entity165 was punctuated by conflict			1
despite his success in the first two seasons , they were three fraught years			0
he struggled to connect with the @entity171 fans and his failure to master @entity173 often led to him losing his cool at press conferences			0
when he left he announced : ‘ friends of the press i am leaving			0
’ he had to fight to make players understand his vision and his tactical rigour caused friction			0
that was nowhere more clear than in his relationship with @entity185 , the @entity186 prima donna who had cost @entity165 € 20million			1
for two seasons he was at the top of the scoring charts but then fell out with his manager in the third			0
conflict : @entity28 had to fight to make players at @entity165 understand his vision and tactics @entity185 refused to play on the left of a 4 - 3 - 3 system and his punishment was a spell on the bench.telling the @entity200 to stick to his position on the left or make space for others instead of roaming freely may well have been integral to a tactical plan but it was not the best way to survive the football politics of @entity209			1
replacing @entity165 superstars with a busload of former @entity213 players , did not endear him to the locals either			1
in the end there were more enemies than friends ; more tiffs than trophies			0
only time will tell how his methods will go down in @entity2 ’s dressing - room			1
tactical mastermind : @entity28 , pictured with assistant @entity224 , will be keen to get his methods across @entity225 will continue to spend - @entity226 at @entity24 , even the club ’s management had doubts about the way @entity28 was emerging as a control freak as he fought to deal with issues behind the scenes			1
there are echoes of sir @entity236 in @entity28 ’s style but , initially , it did n’t go down well at @entity24			1
president @entity239 said : ‘ @entity24 can no longer be controlled by one person			2
@entity3 is of the opinion that he has to organise everything by himself , but an individual can not handle all of that			2
’ the great @entity245 told the individualistic @entity9 to ‘ delegate more responsibility ’			2
the board even questioned , albeit implicitly , the professional confidence of their head coach by suggesting it might be better to switch from a 4 - 3 - 3 system to 4 - 4 - 2			0
@entity28 simply stuck to his methods			0
he said : ‘ when i started with @entity213 in 1991 in the first half of the season the people only wanted @entity255			2
that was n’t fun for me			0
not fun : @entity28 's first few months at @entity213 were difficult as fans would have preferred @entity255 ‘ with @entity165 in 1997 it was the same			1
it took four or five months before it was much better			0
it was similar with @entity263 and exactly the same with @entity24			2
‘ i predicted at the beginning of the season we would need a few months ’ patience until everything worked out			0
the trophies are handed out in may			0
’ he was proved right			0
by the end of the season the @entity37 were partying with their two domestic trophies and despite missing out on a treble when they lost in @entity277 to @entity278 ’s @entity108 , they had re-established themselves at @entity281 ’s top table			0
@entity2 fans will pray that , even if the going gets tough for the first few months , their new manager will be proved right again			1
and that he ’s still got the b * * * s to do the job			0
