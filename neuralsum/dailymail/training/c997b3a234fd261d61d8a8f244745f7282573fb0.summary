by @entity0 after the excesses of the weekend , it ’s natural to worry about the effects on the body			0
now scientists have found monday is the day we fret most about our health			1
research shows health - related @entity9 searches peak on the first working day of the week , with tuesday scoring almost as high			1
but as the week wears on , we lose interest in medical matters , according to psychologists at @entity14			1
health - related @entity9 searches peak on the first day of the month , a study has found ( library image ) it ’s estimated that there are an average of 160 million health - related searches on @entity9 alone every day of the year			1
researchers wanted to see if there was any correlation between when we worry most about our health and weekly patterns in sickness			0
for example , numerous studies suggest heart attack rates spike on a monday			2
a 10 - year study in @entity32 revealed cardiac deaths peak then before hitting a low on tuesday			0
weekend binge - drinking , coupled with the stress of going back to work , is thought to put the heart under added strain			1
heart attacks , strokes and high blood pressure all peak early in the week - which scientists say is linked to excess at the weekend ( library image ) other studies meanwhile , suggest wednesday is the gloomiest day of the week – possibly because it is the furthest point from the weekend			1
the @entity50 team analysed internet searches on @entity9 for health on every day between 2005 and 2012			2
they broke it down as a percentage of overall search volume and found that monday and tuesday queries were 30 per cent greater than the rest of the week combined			2
searches dropped by three per cent on wednesdays , 15 per cent on thursdays , almost half on fridays and by a whopping 80 per cent on saturdays			0
on sundays , interest in health bounced back slightly – before peaking again on mondays			0
in a report on their findings the researchers said the results tally with evidence that blood pressure , heart attacks , strokes and infectious diseases all seem to peak early in the week – a health pattern known as circaseptan rhythms			1
they said one explanation is that monday is ‘ akin to a mini @entity75 ’ , where the excesses of the weekend result in a demand for health information			2
‘ poor health choices during the weekend may promote a desire to cleanse come monday			0
‘ there is strong potential for improving public health			0
‘ health promotion campaigns could immediately be made more cost effective by targeting the population early in the week rather than uniformly across the week			0
