by @entity0 you could be forgiven for thinking it was just a normal back garden with its well - kept lawn and trimmed hedgerows			0
but one buyer has clearly seen some added potential in this tiny courtyard plot in central @entity8 after they paid out a staggering £ 84,000 - even though it has no planning permission			1
the land , in @entity12 , is just 0.05 acres in size but after its sale is now worth the equivalent of £ 1.68 million per acre			1
this courtyard garden with no planning permission has been sold in @entity12 for a staggering £ 84,000 having been put on the market for just £ 28,000 it was only expected to sell for around £ 28,000 - but ended up selling for three times this figure to a foreign buyer			1
the new owner will now have to sit on their £ 84,000 investment as it ca n’t be built on			2
for the same price they could have bought themselves a @entity31 - listed one - bedroom flat in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the sale has netted the land ’s owner a quick profit of £ 31,000 , after they bought it eight months ago for £ 53,000			0
@entity39 , head of auctions at @entity41 , said : ' little bits of @entity8 , such as this , are in scarce supply and people want to get their hands on their own little piece of @entity12			2
' @entity49 environments can easily change and so this could be a very long term investment bought with grandchildren and inheritance in mind			0
despite being just 0.05 acres , the tiny courtyard garden is in a prime location in @entity12 , close to @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 ' who knows what it might be possible to do with it in 20 years time			2
' the patch of land is in a residential area close to upmarket shopping areas such as knightsbridge and @entity59 as well as @entity69 and @entity57			0
access into and out of the quaint courtyard garden is through two gates and is surrounded by buildings			0
property valuation site @entity74 estimates the average property price in the area surrounding the garden , is £ 2,180,840 the sale follows the £ 700,000 paid for a row of disused garages in @entity82			2
the six garages , in @entity84 , @entity8 were sold in april for ten times their value , after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer			0
the garages , which each had a rental potential of £ 65 a month , were also sold without planning permission for development			1
but that did not deter interest , with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded ' a first '			0
the anonymous buyer , who is understood to be a developer , secured the garages for £ 700,000 - four times the average @entity104 house price , and one - and - a - half times the value of a typical @entity8 property .			1

small garden area in @entity12 , @entity8 , was only expected to sell for £ 28,000

land , with no planning permission , now worth equivalent of £ 1.68m per acre
same price would buy @entity31 - listed one - bed flat in @entity32 , @entity33
