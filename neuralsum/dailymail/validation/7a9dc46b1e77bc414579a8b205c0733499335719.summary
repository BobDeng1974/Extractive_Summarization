@entity0 appreciates fans may get bored of @entity2 this season if he and @entity4 are again totally dominant			1
ahead of this weekend 's season - opening grand prix in @entity7 there is a feeling @entity4 will start the campaign as they finished 2014 - as the superior team			1
last term @entity4 set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16 , with current champion @entity0 claiming 11 of those , as well as equalling @entity17 's 2011 haul of 18 poles in a season			2
@entity0 poses on @entity21 beach on thursday ahead of the season opener in @entity23 the reigning world champion stands with a fan as she takes a selfie ahead of this week 's @entity7 gp @entity0 was speaking at the first pre-race press conference of the season in @entity23 on thursday while there was some relief @entity4 stopped @entity17 's four - year run of title - winning success , should they again blitz the field in 2015 then the already - declining global television audience figures may dip further			1
assessing the situation , @entity0 said : ' a year of dominance is a great thing for a team as a whole , but as a racing driver i 'm sure the fans will want to see close competition			0
' asked if it would be bad for the sport should he win the title by august and whether the fans would get bored , @entity0 replied : ' personally , i would get bored , but i can only speak for myself			2
@entity0 and @entity4 team - mate @entity50 pose in front of the world 's media ahead of the first race last term @entity4 set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16 , with @entity0 claiming 11 @entity0 speaks to the media next to @entity21 beach in @entity23 on wednesday ' if i was a fan watching and the championship was won by then it would n't look so good , would it ? ' but then it 's almost impossible to win it by then , and if you look at most of the recent seasons they 've gone down to the last race			1
' @entity4 , however , were eye - catching over the three pre-season tests as they not only racked up the most laps , but also the quickest , and not even on the best type of rubber available			1
' it 's a work in progress , but of course it feels great , ' said 30 - year - old @entity0 , who starts the season favourite to win a third title			1
' you know it 's great to see all the work that 's been put in by the team , and throughout testing it felt really good			0
@entity4 drivers @entity50 and @entity0 will go head - to - head again for the title ' testing is not always the greatest when you 're in cooler conditions like in @entity90 and @entity91 , but generally it was pretty awesome			1
' with the second title to his name and a car beneath him that is again going to be the one to beat , you would expect @entity0 to be relaxed heading into the new season , but far from it			0
@entity0 appreciates , as at the start of the any campaign , the hard work is only just beginning all over again			0
' i definitely do n't feel i have less pressure , ' said @entity0			0
@entity50 won the opening race in @entity7 last season after @entity0 suffered an engine problem ' the pressure is the same it is every year , but honestly , i did n't arrive at the tests or here thinking , ' okay , i 'm world champion '			2
' i 'm thinking , ' @entity112 , i 've got to do everything again , and i 've got to actually do it better than i did before '			0
' i know everyone else will have taken a step as well , so how do i do that ? it 's not easy to better a season like last year			0
' in terms of performance it was the best year i think i 've ever had , but it does n't mean i ca n't beat it so that 's what i 'm trying to do			0
