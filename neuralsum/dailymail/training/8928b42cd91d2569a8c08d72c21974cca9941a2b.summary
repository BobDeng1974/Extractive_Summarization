just as the human face has evolved considerably since stone age times so it is expected to keep changing in the future			0
today the human brain is three times the size of our primate ancestors			0
as our brains grew so did our heads get bigger , our skulls expanded and our features became flatter			2
now with the advent of wearable technology , such as @entity13 , how will our heads and faces evolve in 20,000 years , 60,000 years and even 100,000 years from now ? 100,000 years : the human face will have evolved to be proportioned to the ' golden ratio , ' with unnervingly large eyes featuring a sideways blink 2013 : a typical man and woman this was the question posed by artist and researcher @entity25 from @entity26 when he quizzed dr @entity27 , who holds a phd in computational genomics from @entity30 in @entity31			1
based on their discussions @entity25 has created a stunning series of images which display one possible evolution for the human race over the next 100,000 years			1
dr @entity27 believes that key to our future evolution will be man ‘ wresting control ’ of the human form from natural evolution and adapting human biology to suit our needs			2
as genetic engineering becomes the norm , ‘ the fate of the human face will be increasingly determined by human tastes ’ writes dr @entity27 , while foreheads will continue to expand as our brains continue to grow larger			0
20,000 years : humans have evolved to have bigger heads due to larger brains , while on their eyes are ' communications lens ' , a more advanced version of ' @entity13 ' as man achieves total mastery over human morphological genetics , the human face will become heavily biased towards features that humans find fundamentally appealing : strong , regal lines , straight nose , intense eyes , and placement of facial features that adhere to the golden ratio and left / right perfect symmetry			1
dr @entity27 believes eyes will grow ' unnervingly large ' as the human race colonizes the solar system and people start living in the dimmer environments of colonies further away from the sun. eyes will also develop in other ways - that would seem startling from our viewpoint today - with new features including eye - shine enhance low - light vision and even a sideways blink from re-constituted plica semilunaris to help protect our eyes from cosmic rays			2
skin will also become more pigmented to help alleviate the damage by harmful uv radiation outside of the earth ’s protective ozone			0
dr @entity27 also predicts that people will have thicker eyelids and a more pronounced superciliary arch ( the smooth , frontal bone of the skull under the brow ) , to deal with the effects of low gravity			0
there will be other functional necessities : larger nostrils for easier breathing in off - planet environments , denser hair to contain heat loss from a larger head , reports @entity113			0
as well as practical developments to suit changing environments there will also be more cosmetic developments			0
parents will choose precisely the genetic makeup of their offspring - selecting the color of their eyes , hair etc. 60,000 years : human beings have even larger heads , larger eyes and pigmented skin			1
a pronounced superciliary arch makes for a darker area below the eyebrows dr @entity27 predicts a trend towards humans wishing to look as natural as possible even as there are greater numbers of technological advancements under the skin			2
' communications lenses ( commlens ) in contacts and miniature bone - conduction devices implanted above the ear will work in tandem , ' predicts dr @entity27			1
' bone - conduction devices , with embedded nanochips , will communicate with some external device for communications and entertainment			1

artist @entity25 has created a stunning series of images displaying the evolution of the human race over the next 100,000 years
humans are set to develop larger heads , larger eyes and pigmented skin
advancements in genetics mean parents will choose how they want their offspring to look with perfect symmetry of features
miniature bone - conduction devices implanted above the ear will work with communications lenses on the eyes , the ' @entity13 ' of their day
