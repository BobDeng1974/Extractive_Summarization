the next biggest complaint was drunk or noisy next - room guests , followed by building work going on close to the hotel			1
guests also cared little for poor quality food at their hotel or for being hassled by travel reps to go on excursions in the poll by insurance company @entity19			2
what annoys @entity21 most on holiday : dirty linen and grubby towels according to some 77 per cent of holidaymakers in a recent survey travel reps flogging excursions was also particularly annoying but other guests bagging the best sunbeds annoyed only 31 per cent of the 2,004 @entity32 adults surveyed			1
despite the @entity32 obsession with talking about the weather , rain ranked only eighth on the list			0
commissioned by @entity19 travel insurance , company boss @entity38 said : ' we put a lot of thought , effort and money into our annual breaks , so it ’s not surprising that we expect the hotels , guest houses , restaurants and travel companies to put the same amount of effort in			0
' once you arrive on your holiday , if there is any aspect of it that you are unhappy with , do n’t be " typically @entity58 " – make sure you get something done about it			0

some 32 per cent of the 2,000 survey participants did not leave tips at bars and restaurants while 29 per cent said they used their room ’s mini bar fridge to keep store - bought drinks and snacks cool rather than consume the hotel ’s supplies			0
@entity90 , head of @entity70 's online business said : ‘ we can understand how holidaymakers often feel entitled to the food from the breakfast bar			0
