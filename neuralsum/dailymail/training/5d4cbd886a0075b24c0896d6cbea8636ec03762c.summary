by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:42 pm on 26th july 2011 @entity3 officials said they sent two fighter planes to intercept @entity6 - 27 jets after the @entity8 aircraft breached its airspace for first time in 12 years			1
the @entity11 had reportedly crossed a boundary to pursue a @entity14 spy plane sent on a surveillance flight over @entity8			1
@entity3 's @entity16 said it sent two aircraft to intercept the @entity8 jets , which had briefly crossed a line in the centre of the @entity22 considered an unofficial air boundary between the two states			1
