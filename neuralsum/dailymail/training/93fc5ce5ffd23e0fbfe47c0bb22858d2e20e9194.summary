a deadly hospital superbug could be treated using capsules of frozen faeces from healthy people , a new study has found			1
the gut infection @entity5 ( @entity6 ) can be life - threatening , especially in the elderly			1
but scientists in the @entity9 found introducing ' normal ' gut bacteria from a healthy donor 's excrement , rebalanced a @entity13 difficile patient 's system , curing their illness			1
they successfully cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in the study at @entity20 in @entity21 of their diarrohea , improving their condition			1
a new study has found capsules of frozen facecal matter from healthy donors can cure @entity13 difficile patients of their severe diarrhoea			1
doctors in the @entity9 cured 18 of the 20 patients taking part in their research			1
( @entity35 picture ) in healthy people the bacteria @entity6 lies harmlessly in the gut			1
but the feared infection is caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the intestines			1
while natural bacteria that protect against infection are decimated by the drugs , @entity6 multiply			1
the result is severe diarrhoea , which can cause fatal complications , including swelling of the bowel from a build - up of gas			2
the new research builds on a @entity55 study published in 2012 where ' stool transplants ' were used to restore the balance of the gut in mice suffering @entity6			2
but the methods used were invasive and presented problems for human patients			0
the researchers developed a method whereby they could freeze healthy stool samples , enclosing them in capsules for patients to swallow			2
they gave 20 patients 30 of the capsules , which contained gut bacteria from four healthy donors			1
the aim was to replace the illness - causing bacteria with non-harmful strains			2
the findings showed 14 of the 20 patients ' diarrhoea was cured over an eight - week period			1
of the six who showed no signs of getting better , they were retreated and four were subsequently cured			0
all the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate @entity6 and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics			2
some had suffered two episodes of severe infection requiring hospital treatment			0
the patients ranged in age from 11 to 89			0
all the study participants were given two capsules on two consecutive days , and doctors followed them up six months later to see if their symptoms had resolved			0
those taking part also reported an improvement in their overall health			0
asked to rate their condition on a scale of one to 10 , patients reported an improvement from an average of five before treatment , to eight after taking the capsules			0
the results have been hailed significant , due to @entity6 's resistant nature to antibiotics			2
but researchers warned ' larger studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate long - term safety and effectiveness '			0
in healthy people @entity6 bacteria lies harmlessly in the gut			1
but some antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut , decimating healthy bacteria that prevents infection , while allowing @entity6 , pictured under the microscope , to multiply , causing severe diarrhoea and potentially life - threatening complications dr @entity124 from @entity125 , who was also involved in the report , warned against people trying to create their own ' home brew ' capsules			1
he told the @entity131 : ' the use of capsules simplifies the procedure immensely , potentially making it accessible to a greater population			0
' but while we are striving to make this treatment more accessible to patients it is important to remind people of the potential dangers of attempting ' home brew ' faecal microbiota transplant using faecal material from family members or friends			1
' this procedure should only be performed under strict medical supervision with material from thoroughly screened donors			0
' hospitals across the @entity55 face monthly targets for both @entity13 difficile rates as well as those of methicillin - resistant @entity155 ( @entity156 )			2
a spike in cases of the so - called ' hospital superbugs ' forced the @entity160 to introduce the new infection - control measures in 2007			0
since then the number of cases have fallen rapidly			0
@entity160 figures show there were 14 , 687 reported cases of @entity6 in @entity167 from april 2012 to march 2013 , compared with 52,988 in 2007			0
the study is published the @entity169 .			0

introducing ' normal ' gut bacteria from healthy donors ' excrement helps ' rebalance ' a @entity13 difficile patient 's system curing their diarrhoea
doctors at @entity20 in @entity21 cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in their study
@entity6 can be life - threatening , especially in the elderly
in healthy people the bacteria lies harmlessly in the gut
feared infection caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the gut allowing @entity6 to multiply causing severe diarrhoea
researchers warn people must not attempt ' home brew ' capsules
