there have been times during @entity3 ’s career as the last line of defence when he has had a raw deal			0
being made the scapegoat for a mistake that allowed @entity9 to equalise for the @entity10 in @entity12 ’s opening @entity14 fixture in @entity15 four years ago is one of them			0
returning to the @entity18 team , to play behind a defence as nervy as new born kittens , is another			1
@entity21 at home was the ultimate anxiety test			1
@entity18 keeper @entity3 punches the ball clear during the win over @entity21 on monday night @entity3 makes a save from @entity27 of @entity21 at @entity28 @entity3 comes out of his box to clear the ball as @entity31 holds off @entity32 last weekend , when @entity34 deputised for @entity18 ’s first - choice keeper against @entity36 , they looked lost in the big wide world of the @entity38			1
@entity3 ’s double save here , brilliantly denying @entity42 ’s long ranger in the 80th minute and smothering the rebound from @entity44 , makes west @entity45 feel a whole lot better			0
here , in a match @entity48 simply had to win to prevent chairman @entity50 pulling the trigger on @entity52 , the former @entity12 keeper offered composure and class			0
@entity55 knows they needed it			0
in the first half especially , for all that @entity58 bullied @entity27 , @entity18 ’s defence played as though the ball was on fire whenever it came near them			1
even the match winner , @entity64 , on defensive duties at set pieces , launched a couple of unnecessary balls high into the stands			2
fortunately , when he was presented with chances at the other end , he was clinical			0
his goals — he notched twice last night against this wretched @entity21 team — could keep @entity48 in the top flight			2
at times , before @entity64 gave them the cushion of a two - goal advantage in the 69th minute , they played as if they had put their boots on the wrong feet			1
@entity81 of @entity18 , pictured tussling with @entity27 , looked nervous in defence @entity21 's @entity84 defender @entity83 is challenged by @entity18 's @entity86 defender @entity85 this defence , comprising left back @entity31 , central defenders @entity81 and @entity89 , plus right back @entity85 , still needs working on			1
if their first touch was bad , their second was usually a tackle			0
to think that @entity81 was an @entity12 international , briefly , when he made his debut against @entity95 at the @entity96 in november 2012			0
this is a different player , someone who has been shifted around a couple of lower - end @entity38 clubs since he was allowed to leave @entity101 by @entity102			0
@entity81 looked a bag of nerves before @entity106 ’s soothing opener , afraid to influence the game at a stage in his career when he should be shouting the odds in this @entity18 team			2
he steadied himself in the second half , but @entity18 were 2 - 0 ahead with 21 minutes left on the clock by then			1
@entity21 barely posed a threat			2
@entity52 has made some big calls of late , jettisoning @entity116 after the team ’s failure to get to grips with the 3 - 5 - 2 formation used at the start of the season			1
this team conceded 18 goals in the league before @entity21 ’s arrival at @entity28 and this defence needed surgery			1
@entity21 striker @entity32 chases @entity18 's ' @entity31 under the floodlights in the capital @entity58 stretches to challenge @entity132 international @entity27 @entity3 made some decent saves , particularly in the first half when he got down quickly to save from @entity135 when the @entity21 midfielder plucked the ball out of the sky			1
at least this is a start , building from the back as @entity52 restructures a team with limited ambitions			0
staying in the @entity38 is achievable and @entity48 ’ manager has done it before , miraculously , with @entity145 back in 2006			0
next up for @entity48 is @entity146 , a short journey across town to @entity149 and a date with the @entity38 leaders on saturday afternoon			0
a couple of seasons ago , when @entity52 had replaced @entity155 as manager of this team , they went to @entity146 and famously came away with a 1 - 0 win			1
@entity161 scored the only goal			2
the renaissance began here and this @entity18 team will come to rely on @entity3 in the turbulent weeks and months ahead			2
without him , there would be no defence for this @entity18 team			0
@entity116 was dropped after failing to get to grips with @entity18 's formation @entity52 has had to make some big decisions with his struggling @entity18 side			1

@entity18 defeated @entity21 2 - 0 to lift them off the bottom of their table after their clash at @entity28
@entity64 scored the opening goal with a *stunning* half *volley* from @entity179 's knock down
@entity64 doubled the lead shortly after the second half by *nipping* into score his fourth goal of the season
