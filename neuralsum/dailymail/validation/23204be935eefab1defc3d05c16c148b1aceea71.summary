@entity6 has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2015 regular season for sending text messages to the sideline during games last season			1
the league announced its punishment on monday , ending an investigation that hung over the franchise during yet another turbulent offseason and threatened to undermine the @entity3 ' upcoming draft			1

@entity3 has 10 picks in the upcoming draft , including two in the first round ( @entity68 12 and 19 ) and six of the first 115			2
the @entity3 , who went 7 - 9 last season , could be positioning themselves to make a run at one of the top quarterbacks , and losing any assets would not only have weakened their bargaining power , but prevented a team with several holes from adding young talent			1

the rule forbids communication to the sidelines , coach 's booths , locker room or any other club - controlled areas			0

the texting inquiry was just one of several issues to hound the @entity3 this winter			2

throughout the inquiry , @entity51 professed his loyalty to @entity6 , who was promoted in february 2014 when team president @entity136 and @entity138 @entity137 were fired			0
' we accept the league 's ruling , ' @entity51 said			1
' @entity2 made a mistake and takes full responsibility for his role in violating the policy			0
