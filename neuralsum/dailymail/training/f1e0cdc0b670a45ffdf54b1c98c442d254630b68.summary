for author @entity1 , raw chicken is coloured blue			1
pain , of whatever variety , is orange , while different letters show up in different hues			1
@entity1 is one of the estimated four per cent of the population with synaesthesia , a neurological condition that makes sufferers see the world in vivid hues			1
here , @entity1 , author of a semi-autobiographical new novel named @entity13 that charts the adventures of a woman with the condition , reveals what living in a real - life rainbow is really like			1
@entity19 : author and synaesthete @entity1 sees pain as orange , chicken as blue and the letter a as yellow ' speaking about the condition , synaesthete @entity29 once said : ' @entity30 is not a condition – it ’s a super-power ! like flying or throwing fire from the finger			1
' but i did n't know that growing up			0
i had never heard about synaesthesia , a condition that affects approximately four per cent of the population and turns letters and numbers into vivid colours			1
my ability to taste colour and even hear it made me different			2
but , as i was to discover , seeing the world through a kaleidoscope would prove to be a stroke of luck that would reverberate throughout my life			0
i was also nine when i started my first book – a thriller called @entity52 in which lurid orange jelly beans attack a city simply by being orange			2
' my parents loved the fact that their young daughter was writing a book , but they worried that the premise made no sense			0
but it made sense to me			0
incredible : many blind people , among them @entity68 , perceive the world around them in bright colour colourful world : both @entity73 and @entity74 are reported to be among the synaesthete population how could they not know that particular colour orange is violent ? seeing it inflicts pain – i tried to tell them : stomach aches , head - aches , dizziness , even vomit			1
forty years later i have begun to understand synaesthesia – a neurological field of study that ’s in its intriguing infancy			2
there are synaesthesia and neurology labs doing amazing research – dr. @entity94 ’s program in @entity95 , @entity96 is one			2
there ’s a sensory integration lab at the @entity100			0
there are advancements being made at the @entity103 and the @entity104			0
it seems we may be on the cusp of solving important cognition issues of age - related dementia , @entity110 , dyslexia , and improving knowledge retention for students			0
in my case , i ’ve learned enough to know that orange does not inflict pain on most people – not even on most synaesthetes			1
agonising : for author @entity1 , the colour orange is inextricably associated with feeling pain @entity121 : although pink to most of us , raw chicken is blue according to @entity1 not everyone will agree with me that undercooked chicken is blue			1
it does n’t look blue - just the fact of it is blue			2
it ’s a perception , not an actual visible colour , even in the mind			2
i think it ’s the texture and smell of raw chicken that ’s blue – the sliminess , the soft gelatinousness of it			1
the danger it represents , eating raw chicken , somehow in my mind ’s eye , is just blue			1
many blind people – including @entity68 – are known to be synaesthetes , which makes sense when you exchange the word ‘ see ’ for ‘ perceive ’			1
evidently , his musical notes are perceived in colour – same as @entity74 and @entity73 and @entity151			1
so too , @entity153 and @entity152			0
many creative geniuses in both visual and performing arts report synaesthetic experience – @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161			0
but all synaesthetes are different			0
the letter ‘ a ’ for one person is yellow and for another it ’s blue , while some do n't associate a colour associated with ’ a ' - even if the rest of their alphabet is in colour			1
most people do not associate the colour of cream with the transitional moment of wakefulness to sleep , like i do			1
but as i finally made sense of synaesthesia , i was able to write my own synaesthesia novel that needed to be written			0
in ‘ @entity181 loses her virginity at age 17 in the back of a car in a powerful explosion of colours and smells and cross-wired senses			0
gift : according to @entity1 , seeing the world through a rainbow of bright colour is creative gift she ’s with her twin sister ’s boyfriend , so add to all the sensory chaos , a big dose of guilt			1
soon after , @entity181 marries a man whose career later moves the family from @entity203 to @entity204 , and she has to figure out who she really is – what her true colours are , you might say – to try to save herself , her marriage , and her family			0
@entity13 is sort of a grown woman ’s coming - of - age story , as she comes into an acceptance of herself , her colours , and smells and cross-wired experience			0
in @entity181 ’s case , synaesthesia is both a blessing and a burden			0
for most people i ’ve interviewed it ’s generally viewed as a gift			0
but even those who hear loud music or experience powerful phantom smells or must navigate through fogs of false vision -- even then , no one seems willing to lose it			0
' @entity1 is the author of ‘ @entity233 ’ ( £ 7.99 , @entity234 ) , available now at @entity235			2
