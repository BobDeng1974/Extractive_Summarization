caught out : @entity0 has been given the first points on his driving licence in 30 years after being caught speeding after being chased out of @entity4 by an angry mob , you would think that @entity0 would keep a low profile for at least a few weeks			1
but the under fire @entity8 presenter has found himself in trouble again after getting a speeding ticket for the first time in 30 years			1
the controversial motoring show host wrote in his column that he had been travelling ' 80 something ' in a 60mph zone , and brushed off the incident , saying it was ' nothing catastrophic , nobody died			0
' @entity0 was snapped by a speed camera while driving too fast on a 260 - mile drive from @entity22 , @entity23 , to @entity24			1
despite noticing the cameras on a stretch of the @entity27 near @entity28 , @entity0 , 54 , was caught out for the first time in three decades			2
he was told he was driving too quickly to attend a speed awareness course and was given points on his licence			1
when asked what speed he was doing when he was snapped by the fixed camera , @entity0 told @entity35 : ‘ i ca n’t even remember , 80 something , 82 in a 60 , nothing catastrophic			1
’ he added : ‘ i was only a couple of miles over being allowed to do the [ course ] , it ’s not catastrophic , nobody died			0
’ road safety campaigners jumped on his comments as irresponsible			0
@entity43 , executive director of @entity44 , a charity for crash victims , said his comments were ‘ absolutely shocking ’			0
‘ we should penalise people for excessive speed – it ’s risk - related and it ’s dangerous , ’ she said , adding : ‘ we should expect more from him and he should be able to afford a car with a speed limiter if needs be			0
’ @entity0 previously caused offence with a speeding remark in 2008 when he claimed to have driven 186mph on a public road , saying : ‘ the speed limit ’s annoying for people who have a job to do			2
’ writing in his column for @entity64 last month , @entity0 moaned about the number of speed cameras he passed while on the long drive to @entity24 in a @entity68			1
earlier this month , @entity0 and the @entity8 crew were attacked by an angry mob in @entity4 after a row over the number plate on a car he was driving through the @entity75 country firstly , the @entity8 host passed a speed camera van on what he described as a ' magnificent road ' over @entity80			1
he said he was still ' lightly fuming ' when he was then restricted to a 50mph speed limit for a long stretch of the @entity27 between @entity83 and the turn - off for @entity28			0
the furious @entity86 presenter wrote in his column in september that he would like to ' stick some cocktail sticks into [ the ] eyes ' of the person who came up with the speed restriction			1
he added : ' and it gets worse because when the roadworks finally ended , i found myself on a stretch where there are speed - camera gantries every few hundred yards , to catch those who are desperate to make up for lost time			0
' it seems that despite taking note of the cameras , @entity0 did not slow down enough			2
today he complained that the cameras had caught him , handing him his first points since the 1980s			0
he wrote : ' last month , i wrote in a blind fury about how many speed cameras i 'd encountered on a drive from @entity22 to @entity24			1
