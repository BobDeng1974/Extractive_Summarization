by @entity0 step aside @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , we could soon be able to buy our internet from websites including @entity7 and @entity8			1
the online giants have been gradually buying up miles of unused fibre optic cables in a bid to expand their networks and control how much traffic they can send			1
reports in the @entity17 also state that by owning private networks the companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to			2

by owning private networks , the companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to during the late 1990s many companies laid more cable than they needed , meaning there were entire networks left unused			1
when fibre is used , it is ‘ lit up ’ , meaning these unused cables are considered dark			1
in 2008 , @entity7 invested in a £ 300million cable project to connect @entity42 to @entity43			2
it later bought up a further 6,000 miles of cable across @entity47 countries , including @entity48			0
@entity7 now owns 100,000 miles of cable routes globally			1
in november it announced the @entity52 project in @entity53 that connects home in the region to its 1 gigabit service for around $ 70 ( £ 43 ) a month			0
in june , @entity8 extended its @entity58 network and expanded its services to a data centre near the @entity61			1
both companies have also invested in submarine cables in waters around @entity47			0
legally , governments can submit court orders to companies for information and data held on their networks , whether its a private network or not			0
if @entity7 and other companies are leasing cable from a broadband provider , the provider will be served the order and it will be their decision to release information , for example			1
by owning their own networks , web companies can be the gatekeeper for this information and have greater control over what the government gets access to			0
it can also give a better indication as to exactly how governments are monitoring them and their networks			0
until recently , many of the cables laid under the ground , and in the sea known as submarine cables , were owned by network operators and broadband providerfs such as @entity97 and @entity3 in the @entity98 and @entity99 and @entity100 in the @entity101 according to the reports , @entity7 now owns 100,000 miles of cable routes , and in november it announced the @entity52 project which is currently only available in @entity53			1
by comparison , this is more than double the amount of cable routes owned by @entity101 operator sprint , according to @entity17			2
the enormous quantity of cables means that @entity7 is beginning to rival some of the telecom companies that have up until now considered them as clients			2
the @entity52 project means houses in the area can swap their internet service provider for @entity7 's service , which the company claims is 100 times faster than average speeds			2
until recently , many of the cables , pictured , were owned by network operators and broadband providers			0
by owning the cables themselves , web companies can reduce costs			0
they can also serve as much traffic as they want , meaning that videos do n't buffer and pages load quicker at peak times , for example @entity52 costs $ 70 ( £ 43 ) a month for @entity133 or $ 120 ( £ 74 ) with a tv subscription			0
in june , @entity8 extended its @entity58 network and expanded its services to a data centre near the @entity61			1
both companies have also invested in submarine cables in waters around @entity47			0
previously , websites could either rent cables from these providers , or pay a fee to use them			0
these providers could then control how much traffic was sent over the network , and at certain times could even ‘ throttle ’ the traffic to avoid the network from crashing when a lot of people tried to access it			2
by owning the cables themselves , companies can reduce costs and increase investment into making the services faster			1

web companies have been buying this so - called dark fibre to create more effective and faster ways to satisfy the growing traffic to its services .			1

@entity7 now owns 100,000 miles of fibre optic cable routes globally
@entity8 also extended its network in @entity58 by buying unused cables
by owning the cables , companies can control how much traffic they send
this stops internet providers from throttling traffic - making services faster
it also prevents governments from being able to *spy* on their services
