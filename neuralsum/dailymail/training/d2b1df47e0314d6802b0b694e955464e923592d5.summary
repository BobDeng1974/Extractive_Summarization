by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 16:27 est , 20 july 2012 eight men on trial for murdering three others during rioting last summer walked free from court to whoops and cheers yesterday – after jurors were told the detective in charge of the investigation ‘ lied ’ on oath			2
the defendants were sprayed with champagne as they emerged from @entity15 @entity14 after a jury took four hours to dismiss the three murder charges against each man			2
following the verdict , judge mr @entity19 appealed for calm on the streets as police said extra officers would be deployed at the first sign of any trouble			1
speaking outside court yesterday , mr @entity36 , 47 , urged people to ‘ accept the outcome ’ of the trial and appealed for ‘ peace and calm in our community ’			2
his son , @entity49 , 20 , and brothers @entity51 , 30 and @entity52 , 31 , were seen on cctv being catapulted almost ten feet in the air after being hit by one of three cars involved in what the prosecution called a ‘ modern - day chariot charge ’			1
the prosecution claimed the eight defendants – all in the cars involved – were guilty of a ‘ joint enterprise ’			1
they said the lead car , an @entity65 , had worked to lure a crowd of @entity68 men which included the victims on to the road , where they were then hit by one of the two following vehicles			2
but the defendants claimed the collision had been an accident involving no planning and many of them , including @entity80 , the driver of the @entity81 which hit the men – knew the victims			1
champagne showers : the newly acquitted are sprayed with champagne after all eight were found not guilty of murder following the conclusion of the 12 - week trial , it can be revealed that the officer in charge of the police investigation is under investigation himself for potentially jeopardising the prosecution by lying in the witness box			1
detective chief inspector @entity97 could face a charge of perjury after mr @entity19 ruled he had ‘ invented ’ an account given on oath about why defence barristers had not been told of offers of immunity to eyewitnesses until mid-way through the trial			2
the revelation , after the witnesses had given evidence , prompted the judge to temporarily halt proceedings to ask @entity112 to explain the mistake – only for him to claim prosecutors had been told of the issue at the start of the case			2
the defence argued the ‘ extensive ’ lies rendered a fair trial impossible			0
barrister @entity121 said @entity112 ’s actions amounted to perjury , which carries a maximum sentence of ten years ’ imprisonment			0
tragedy : from left , @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity52 were knocked down and killed during last summer 's riots while protecting their community from looters in @entity15 in his submissions to the judge , mr @entity121 said of @entity112 : ‘ he came to court and on any view lied pretty extensively about what he had said to counsel			1
’ defence barristers urged the judge to throw out the case , an application he dismissed			0
but he did tell jurors that much of the evidence of the eyewitnesses in question about the defendant ’s behaviour in the cars that night could be considered unreliable			0
@entity36 holding a picture of his son @entity49 the day after his son 's death yesterday , @entity152 refused to accept that the blunder was to blame for the failure to secure a single conviction and said the judge could have halted proceedings if he felt @entity112 had jeopardised the trial			1
the case has been referred to the @entity160 , which has now launched an investigation into the detective ’s conduct			0
@entity112 has not been suspended			0
defendants @entity29 , 21 , @entity165 , 26 , @entity166 , 31 , @entity167 , 27 , @entity168 , 30 , @entity169 , 24 , @entity80 , 30 , and @entity170 , 18 , all from the @entity15 area , hugged and shook hands in the dock as the verdicts were returned			1
moments later , the judge urged the people of @entity15 , including relatives in the public gallery , to respect the jury ’s findings that the deaths were a ‘ terrible accident ’			0
he said the deaths occurred at a time of unprecedented civil disorder			0
‘ it is important that however strong feelings are within the community in @entity32 and surrounding areas , that calm is maintained and that these verdicts are respected , ’ he added			0
mr @entity19 also directly addressed the victims ’ relatives , including mr @entity36 , in the aftermath of the verdicts			0
the judge told them : ' i know this has been really terrible for you , do n’t think i do n’t know that			0
' i know mr @entity36 has done wonderful things for the city in ensuring we did n’t have a complete conflagration last august			1

@entity225 , of the @entity226 , said prosecutors had been confident the evidence collected offered a realistic chance of conviction			1
an @entity160 spokesman said : ‘ @entity232 was heard during the trial suggesting that certain witnesses may have been promised immunity from prosecution by the police in return for them giving evidence against the defendants			1
‘ the judge in a statement to the court has since raised concerns about the evidence given to him by a @entity248 during this questioning , this was the senior investigating officer in the murder case			0
