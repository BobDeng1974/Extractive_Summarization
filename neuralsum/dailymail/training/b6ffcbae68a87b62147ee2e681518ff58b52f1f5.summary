undergraduates at @entity9 will be given the opportunity to visit the @entity12 ’s first ‘ puppy room ’ where they can relax and play with the young dogs			1
after a similar service offered at a @entity17 university went viral , the initiative was brought to @entity9			0
puppy love : a student at @entity9 holds one of the @entity22 puppies brought in to help undergraduates calm down during exam time a successful trial run with @entity22 and @entity27 puppies was held in february , and now the @entity28 will run sessions throughout the exam term			1
‘ we received a huge amount of positive feedback from students regarding a similar initiative at a @entity17 university last year , ’ says @entity32 president of societies and student activities at @entity28			0
‘ we had a trial run a few months ago when we brought in the puppies for a few hours from @entity43 to see how the students would react			0
‘ we got a really positive reaction to that from both the guide dogs and the students , it really chilled them out , so that encouraged us to get this set up for the exam period			2
' dog days over : the ' puppy room ' scheme is being rolled out at @entity9 following similar schemes in @entity17 and the @entity58 top dog : the visiting puppies from @entity43 will be there for students during the exams the puppy programme is already available at several @entity66 universities with institutions such as @entity68 now providing dogs on site that students can borrow			1
miss @entity32 said : ‘ so many students read about the initiative when it was done in @entity17 and came forward asking us to do a similar initiative here and we do n't think it 's been done in the @entity12 before			1
’ it is hoped that the dogs will calm frazzled nerves and cheer the students up during the exam period in may			2
miss @entity32 added that the puppy room is ‘ essential ’ to improve and maintain the mental health of students during the most stressful period of their academic year , and help them build a home from home			1
she added : ‘ students struggle a lot with stress coming up to exam time , not only with exams , but also are a lot of deadlines with essays and dissertations that come up at the same time			1
‘ in addition to this there are the financial pressures for students as well as friends and family being far away			0
‘ we hand out packages for students , giving them recommendations on what they should eat and drink to make sure they stay healthy to avoid stress as well as handing out free tea and coffee before exams			0
‘ we also work with the sports and exercise team , who give out free massages to students and encourage healthy eating			0
