great news for customers , but bad news for bar staff everywhere - scientists have created a barman robot that can serve waiting punters much faster and more fairly			1
@entity7 , named after its creator , the @entity10 in @entity12 programme , has a tablet computer for a head showing big , comic - style eyes used to establish eye contact with customers			1
@entity7 ' mouth moves in sync with its speech and the one - armed metal body forming its torso is fixed behind the bar , where @entity7 accepts drink orders , reaches for the drink using its arm and a four - fingered hand and serves them to its customers			1
while 4 per cent believe prostitutes will be replaced by robots it can read a customer 's body language to spot who needs to be served first , and who does n't need or want a drink because they 're not paying attention			1
the robot 's behaviour is based on an earlier study by @entity51 that found 90 per cent of customers deliberately face the bar			1
by contrast , one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender , perhaps indicating that these are not as successful strategies			1
those not needing to quench their thirst subconsciously maintained a small distance to the bar and turned away from it by chatting to friends instead , signalling to staff that they did not want service , the scientists said			0
psychologist @entity72 , from @entity51 , claimed : ' effectively , the customers identify themselves as ordering and non-ordering people through their behaviour			0
' the study , published in online journal frontiers in @entity78 , looked at recordings of customers at nightclubs in @entity82 and @entity83 to analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff ’s attention			1
the findings formed part of pan-europe research team that developed the bartending robot			0
scientists found only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they wanted like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender the aim is to advance technology so that @entity7 can display socially intelligent behaviour that humans take for granted in daily life			1
@entity100 said : ' in order to respond appropriately to its customers the robot must be able to recognise human social behaviour			0
' @entity105 should be able to understand users who have no prior knowledge about the robot and who have not been briefed in any way			0
in the noisy environment of a night club , the system can not rely on its language components alone so the robot learns how to interpret body language			2
@entity83 researchers said busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them , instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers professor @entity100 added : ' currently , we are working on the robot ’s ability to recognise when a customer is bidding for its attention , thus , we have studied the process of ordering a drink in real life			2
' the robot requires a clear - cut definition of which signals indicate an order and which do not			0
without a proper definition , it will misinterpret its customers ’ signals , which could annoy people by responding inappropriately to their behaviour			0
the findings of the behavioral bar study were used to update @entity7 ’ programming			0
dr @entity72 said : ' with the update , @entity7 only talks to people whose position and body posture clearly indicate that they wish to order a drink			2
' only if the system is certain that the customers would like to order a drink , @entity7 will respond in @entity151 " how can i help you ? " but cutting the queue is a no - go with @entity7			2
it maintains the order of the customers by memorising who came first			0

@entity7 has a tablet for a head with a camera that reads body language
it can assess who to serve first and who does n't need or want a drink
scientists found 90 per cent of customers deliberately face the bar to be served , while 1 in 15 look at their wallets to signal they want a drink
