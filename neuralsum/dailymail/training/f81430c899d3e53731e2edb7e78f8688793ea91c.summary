' @entity19 saw the chef who could hardly stand he had been drinking so much and just like on @entity12 the staff were running round trying to sort things out			2
' some meals were served frozen , they ran out of stock on a pre-ordered menu and desserts were only served to half the guests			1
the couple say when they did complain , staff at the @entity40 , @entity41 - upon - @entity42 , @entity43 , were dismissive and told them : ' what do you expect for a cheap wedding ? ' ' we booked a three course meal for 65 guests and there was a 45 minute delay from the top table being served and the rest			1

some meals were served frozen , very unprofessional , arrogant staff and owner does n't have a clue ! ! ' i would n't recommend the @entity136 to anyone , i 'm disgusted at how we 've been treated and the response to our complaint was " what do you expect from a cheap wedding " well for one it 's the price they quoted for what we wanted and secondly what we received was n't fit for a dog			1
mrs @entity15 said when she complained the owner of the hotel told her she had spent £ 5,000 on her own wedding ' i 'm heart broken that we booked there , they ruined the best day of my life			1
