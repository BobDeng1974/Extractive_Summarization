by @entity0 published : 00:19 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 17 december 2012 first and youngest : @entity1 was the youngest of the 16 six - year - olds who was killed in the shooting on friday just three days after the young children were gunned down in their classrooms , a half - dozen of their bodies are now being prepared for coffins as the first funerals will be held on monday			1
the first funeral on monday is that of @entity1 , the youngest of the 16 six - year - old victims			1
the funeral for his friend @entity1 will be held at the same time at a @entity1 facility , and a wake will be held for @entity1 , also 6 - years - old , later that afternoon			1
@entity17 and fellow @entity19 student @entity1 will both have funeral services at @entity21 on tuesday , and @entity22 is going to be buried in neighboring @entity23 that same day			1
the first adult victim 's funeral will take place on wednesday when the 27 - year - old heroic teacher @entity27 has her service			1
student @entity1 will have his funeral on the same day			1
those are just six of the 20 funerals for the student victims that the town 's clergy need to coordinate and host in the coming week , a task so daunting that 100 funeral directors from across the state have volunteered to help the process			1
some have donated use of their hearses and time , while coffin manufacturers have given heart - wrenchingly small child - sized caskets for the victims			2
the @entity49 family , which includes @entity52 's twin sister @entity51 who he called ' his best friend ' and their 8 - year - old sister @entity54 , reportedly moved to @entity1 from @entity56 a year ago because they felt that @entity58 schools were not safe enough for the young children			1
house of worship : @entity52 's funeral will be held at the @entity63 temple on monday , kicking off a grim week where 20 young children and six of their teachers are laid to rest ' the reason they moved to that area is because they did not consider any school in @entity73 on the same level			1
that 's one of the reasons they moved , for safety and education , ' @entity52 's uncle @entity49 told @entity81			0
@entity51 survived because she had been assigned to a different class than her brother , placing her out of the gunman 's path when the shooting took place			0
@entity52 's mother was supported by their family rabbi when she saw her son 's dead body for the first time on sunday			2
the @entity95 reports that she listened to the suggestion of the social worker who warned that she should not lift the sheet covering the boy 's corpse , which only exposed his head and neck			0
@entity1 's only undertaker is so overwhelmed with grisly mortuary tasks like covering up bullet holes that he has been forced to hire an additional 30 staffers			1
@entity108 , the director of @entity109 , said he ’s hired between 25 and 30 new staffers to handle the 11 victims from friday 's @entity1 massacre , reports the @entity113			2
@entity108 said the additional workers will help handle what called it ' the week from hell			0
' ' i ’ve never seen anything like this , never , ” @entity108 said			0
' we added staff to meet the demand and do what we do			0
' since the funeral home opened in 1903 , none of the previous generations of morticians has been tasked with providing services for so many grieving families at once , according to the @entity81			2
@entity108 said his staff is working around the clock for a week ’s worth of wakes			0
and to conceal gruesome bullet holes			0
' we ’re trained to cover them up , ' he said			0
' we have people with special skills to do that			0
some caskets will be open and some will be closed			0
' for his biggest fan : before the @entity145 took the field against the @entity147 , @entity144 tweeted : ' today 's game is for you , @entity150 ' gesture : receiver @entity144 paid tribute to one of his fans , @entity1 ( right ) , whose family said will be wearing a @entity144 jersey when he is buried on monday the devout @entity159 family have announced that memorial contributions donated in the boy 's name will be used to fund the planting of trees in @entity63			1
@entity1 's remembrances have been a combination of intimately private and publicly broadcast			2
after his family said that they were going to bury the avid football fan in the jersey of his favorite @entity145 player , @entity144 announced that he would pay tribute to the little boy by writing his name on his cleats for their game against the @entity147 on sunday			0
though the nationally - televised game drew a great deal of attention to the young boy and their family , they decided to keep the wake on monday private .			2

@entity188 victim , @entity1 , will be the first one buried on monday
@entity1 will also have his funeral at the same time , followed by two more students on both tuesday and wednesday
