harmless : @entity22 officials say a @entity4 nuclear - powered attack given safe harbor from @entity7 ' as it posed no threat ' ( file picture ) the @entity23 's sources spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of ant - sub warfare			1
' while i ca n’t talk about how we detected it , i can tell you that things worked the way they were supposed to , ' one official said , adding that the submarine ' poses no threat whatsoever '			0
officials said the submarine was probably conducting anti-submarine warfare efforts against @entity22 ballistic and cruise missile submarines at @entity49 , @entity50			1

those @entity22 vessels are a known target of @entity4 attack subs			2
iron man : though @entity64 's regime has increased naval patrols and bomber flybys , @entity22 defense officials have downplayed the incidents as president @entity68 seeks stronger political ties to @entity70 flexing their muscle : officials say @entity4 sub patrols have increased in recent years however , the @entity4 sub was considered safe enough that it was given a safe harbor in @entity77 , @entity6 's commercial port during @entity7 , within listening range of @entity49			1

@entity113 is the designation for ballistic missile submarines			0
@entity4 's navy carried out hundreds of submarine patrols during the @entity109 to maintain first - and - second - strike nuclear capabilities			1
even when the @entity111 was in decline in 1984 it still conducted 230 submarine patrols			0
today it conducts fewer than 10 a year			0
' as was their primary mission during the @entity109 , @entity4 @entity127 [ nuclear attack submarines ] would likely be trying to track @entity22 nuclear missile submarines deploying from @entity49 , @entity50 , and to monitor @entity22 naval deployments from @entity133 , @entity134 , ' @entity125 , military analyst with the @entity126 , wore in an email			1

in both cases @entity22 and @entity168 interceptor jets met the @entity4 bombers			2
but @entity22 officials dismissed both incidents as the @entity68 administration seeks to establish closer ties to @entity70			0
