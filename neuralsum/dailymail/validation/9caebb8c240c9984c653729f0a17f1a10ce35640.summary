@entity0 scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries to help @entity2 shatter @entity3 ' 100 per cent record in @entity5			1
the @entity7 half - back twice demonstrated exceptional pace to punish errors by the reigning champions to put the @entity11 on their way to a 24 - 22 win and leave @entity14 still looking for a first victory at @entity16 since 2008			2
rovers , who claimed the scalp of @entity20 last month , were good value for a third successive home win that rounded off a good day for the club after they earlier announced the notable acquisition of @entity25 as football manager for 2016			0
@entity0 scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries @entity3 , who trailed 24 - 12 with with five minutes to go , could have snatched a point had former @entity2 co-captain @entity30 been able to convert @entity32 's last - minute try but it would have been tough on the impressive robins			1
saints stay top of the table but they were a shadow of the side that beat @entity39 a week earlier and coach @entity40 must now pick them up for their @entity42 derby at the @entity43			0
the champions were unfortunate to lose @entity46 hooker @entity45 to injury but they made an ideal start when skipper @entity49 , who began his professional career at @entity16 , re-gathered his own grubber kick to touch down and a goal from @entity30 made it 6 - 0 after just three minutes			2
it was @entity14 for the opening quarter but @entity45 was held up over the line and @entity0 twice punished their casual play to put his side in front			1
the former @entity61 scrum - half pounced on @entity49 's kick for his first long - range try and then picked off @entity30 ' pass to outsprint the @entity14 cover for his second			2
@entity66 converted both to put the @entity11 into a 12 - 6 lead but the champions were back level on 26 minutes when the ball was fed back from @entity49 's hoisted kick and @entity72 got @entity73 over at the corner			2
@entity30 landed the difficult conversion but @entity14 were forced to re-organise their team six minutes from half - time when @entity45 was forced from the field after taking a head knock			0
@entity80 demonstrated his versatility by switching from full - back , where he began as third choice in the absence of @entity85 and @entity86 , to hooker , with @entity73 going to full - back			0
rovers had a try disallowed when slow - motion replays indicated a knock - on by hooker @entity92 after he re-gathered @entity94 's kick but when @entity3 winger @entity95 again demonstrated his fallibility under the high ball his opposite number @entity99 struck with the home side 's third try two minutes before the break			1
the momentum was clearly with the @entity11 and @entity14 were forced to survive a torrid time in the third quarter			0
@entity66 was wide with a penalty attempt and then had a try disallowed after producing a flying finish at the corner only for slow - motion replays to reveal he was in touch			0
@entity0 could have doubled his try tally following breaks by @entity92 and @entity115 but @entity89 could not apply the finishing touches , and they had to settle for two successful @entity119 penalties to edge them 20 - 12 ahead			1
@entity2 thought they had sealed it when full - back @entity122 went over for a fourth try on 64 minutes but @entity14 staged a tremendous late fightback which caused some anxious moments for @entity128 's men			1
forward @entity129 went over on 75 minutes - @entity30 ' third goal cut the deficit to six points - and @entity32 took a return pass from @entity95 to go over four minutes later .			0

@entity0 scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries
@entity2 ended @entity3 ' 100 per cent record in @entity5 .
