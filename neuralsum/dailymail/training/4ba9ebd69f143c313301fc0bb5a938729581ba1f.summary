@entity0 was brought on in the last minute of extra-time just for the penalty shootout @entity4 goalkeeper saved two of five spot - kicks to send @entity7 through @entity0 distracted @entity9 ’s penalty - takers by telling them he already knew which direction their kick was going in – but it appears he had another technique to influence his opponents			1
for video footage of the shootout shows @entity0 deliberately walking to one side of his goal before four of the five penalties , diving to the opposite corner once the effort was taken			1
and on each occasion the @entity7 goalkeeper guessed right , saving from @entity25 and @entity26 to send the @entity27 into the semi-finals			1
mind games : @entity0 says he told @entity9 's players he knew which direction their penalties were going super sub : @entity7 's @entity0 makes the decisive save to deny @entity9 's @entity26 in the shoot - out @entity0 had only been brought on as replacement for @entity36 in the 120th minute of the goalless draw in @entity38			1
@entity39 has been praised for the psychological advantage the introduction of @entity0 gave his men			2
but the substitute played his own part , as he revealed : ‘ i watched them [ @entity9 ] against @entity46 and studied them and i told the players that i knew where they were going to shoot to make them a bit nervous			0
it happened before when i played against @entity52			0
i told him that i knew and i saved it			0
i just tried that again			0
i ’m so happy it worked			0
’ but did @entity0 ’s pre-penalty routine tempt the @entity57 into picking their corner ? judge for yourself by taking a look at our graphic below … power of persuasion : did @entity0 influence the @entity9 players with his pre-penalty routine ?			2
