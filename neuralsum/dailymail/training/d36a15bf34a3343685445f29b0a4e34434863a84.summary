by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 18:21 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 20:14 est , 8 january 2014 the @entity5 island of @entity6 is facing a huge dilemma - protect the homes of its residents and risk famous surfing beaches or abandon the coastal houses to the whims of the rising waters			1
the high @entity15 swell damaged at least five oceanfront properties in the neighborhood , rekindling a decades - old debate about how best the state and homeowners should respond to beach erosion and the increasingly threatening @entity22			1
some property owners want to be able to install a seawall or something similar to protect their property			0
rising tide : sandbags are piled up in front of properties damaged by severe beach erosion in @entity6 's @entity33 in @entity34			1
residents are revisiting the debate over saving their homes or the beach battle : ' we will endure ' is scrawled on the wall of a house damaged by beach erosion			1
experts warn that building a sea wall would damage the world - famous beaches instead location : @entity49 is at the mercy of the rising waters of the @entity22 doing so , scientists say , could lead the sand on the nearby coastline - including @entity54 , home to some of the world 's top surfing contests - to disappear			1
' do you build a seawall and potentially condemn the beach to extinction in front of the seawall but at the same time buy a lot of time for homeowners on the nearby land to figure out how to move away from that situation ? ' asked @entity72 , a @entity73 coastal geologist			2
' or do you not build a seawall , condemning the homes and the developed land to extinction , but allow the beach to survive ? ' @entity72 said building seawalls always comes to mind wherever severe erosion occurs			1
he said studies show seawalls built on chronically eroding shorelines like @entity54 will only lead to more erosion down the coast			2
@entity72 noted that other @entity6 communities have already lost large chunks of beach because of seawalls			0
these are stark options for @entity54 , where multimillion - dollar homes line the shore and where the globe 's top surfers converge each year for the @entity94 of @entity95			1
wild waters : the high @entity15 swell damaged at least five oceanfront properties in the neighborhood defenses : sandbags are piled up in front of this damaged home resident @entity104 did n't worry too much when she saw waves splashing close to her home on @entity6 's @entity33 on @entity108			1
she had seen the ocean edge close before			2
but before dawn , a neighbor woke her with a call			0
' everything was washing away , ' she remembered the neighbor saying			0
the water claimed @entity104 's deck that day , and washed away a concrete slab the next night - part of a fast - moving collapse of the shore that also ripped out a neighbor 's backyard and forced another to cut away rooms to save the rest of their house			2
property owners wanting to build a seawall would need to draft an environmental study and get a state permit , a process that could take months			0
in the short - term , they may receive emergency authorization to place sandbags and tarp in front of their properties to deflect the waves , said @entity139 , the coastal lands office administrator			1
@entity145 , whose family owns two houses next to @entity104 's that they rent to vacationers , her husband , @entity141 , some friends and volunteers ran out of burlap sacks and had to buy all the pillowcases at @entity151 and made bright orange , red and polka dot sandbags			2
' we need something that 's structurally sound , something that is really big , that can help us , ' she said			0
large surf that regularly hits the @entity33 each winter brought the @entity15 swell , not a freak storm			1
@entity104 said the beach fronting her home was particularly narrow because swells from the north that usually deposit sand during the summer were n't as frequent and westerly swells had taken away sand instead			2
@entity166 and northwest swells have continued to carry away sand this winter , she said			2
but more fundamental factors are also at play			0
one is that sea levels have been rising for years , pushing the ocean inland			1
attraction : the @entity33 on @entity6 in @entity34 brings in the globe 's top surfers each year for the @entity94 of @entity95 another is that the @entity54 coastline is chronically eroding , just like 70 percent of the beaches on @entity6 , @entity179 and @entity181 islands			1
in the long term , both @entity139 and @entity72 believe government agencies should encourage people to move away from the coast to eliminate the question of whether seawalls should be built			0
' we need to accommodate the erosion , allow it to occur , and we need to move away from it so it does n't affect our lives , ' @entity139 said			0
one option would be for a land conservation fund to buy properties along key shorelines and turn these areas into public parks , @entity72 said			0
in @entity34 , the counties decide how far back from the coast dwellings may be built			1
on @entity6 , people may only build homes 40 feet from the shoreline			0
@entity181 and @entity179 counties , however , have adopted tighter rules in recognition of the erosion creeping up on their coastlines			0
but even this may not be far enough , @entity72 said , noting these setbacks still allow buildings right on the sand dunes			0
construction may need to be 150 feet from the shoreline to get away from the dunes , he said			0
@entity49 homes , like many of @entity34 's coastal homes , were built on dunes that would now be feeding the beach with sand if they did n't have structures on them			1
the two - mile stretch of coastline from @entity229 to @entity230 was subdivided in the 1920s , according to ' beaches of @entity6 ' by @entity233			1
danger : these desirable homes are at serious risk from rising waters and beach erosion that was a time when scientists did n't know as much about sand dunes			1
the outlines of dunes are still visible in the rise and fall of pavement on the narrow road next to @entity104 's home			0
erosion like this will likely recur , @entity72 said , as sea levels rise and as climate change causes sea levels to rise even faster			0
this is especially true , he said , in places where sand dunes have been landscaped out of existence or are locked up by development			0
' the event on the @entity33 is a warning for all of us in @entity34 that these sorts of occurrences are part of our future , ' he said .			2

at least five oceanfront properties were damaged by coastal erosion in @entity34 over @entity15
long - standing debate about how to deal with the rising waters of the @entity22 has been *reignited*
building an ocean wall to shield the houses could mean damaging world - famous surfing beaches
but protecting the sand would mean *surrendering* *expensive* homes to the ocean
