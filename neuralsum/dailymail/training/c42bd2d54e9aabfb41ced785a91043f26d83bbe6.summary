shares in @entity3 will be sold to the public next month , before staff can vote on strike action under government plans published yesterday , shares are expected to begin trading on the @entity20 on october 11 , a week before the end of a ballot of workers over a possible strike			1
the @entity25 , which is opposed to the privatisation , is threatening industrial action over pay			1
@entity3 warned yesterday : ‘ potential investors should assume that national strike action and other forms of industrial action will take place across the whole of the group ’s activities during the period immediately after , and may take place during , the offer period			1
’ the earliest a strike could take place is october 23			0
shares will cost from 260p to 330p , although the exact price will not be known until nearer the time			0
the government is selling up to 70 per cent of its stake in the group , which could raise as much as £ 2billion for the @entity46			1
financial institutions such as pension funds began ordering shares yesterday			0
demand was so high that the offer was heavily oversubscribed , suggesting that the share price will be at the higher end of the scale			0
the @entity55 , which is opposed to the privatisation , is threatening industrial action over pay members of the public can collect order forms from the @entity60 or download them online			1
@entity3 yesterday published its prospectus , which sets out all the details of the company			2
it revealed that a host of banks advising the government , led by @entity67 and @entity68 , will receive more than £ 50million in fees for working on the deal			0
this summer , the @entity3 ’s @entity72 chief executive , @entity71 , was criticised for accepting a £ 250,000 payment from the firm to buy a home in one of @entity78 ’s plushest districts			1
she was forced to pay it back after business secretary @entity80 intervened			0
last year the group made profits of £ 324million after handling 17.4billion letters and 1.4billion parcels			1
it expects the volume of letters sent to drop by up to 6 per cent a year , while the number of parcels it collects is expected to rise by 5.5 per cent			1
under government plans , shares are expected to begin trading on the @entity20 on october 11 , a week before the end of a ballot of workers over a possible strike posties visit 75 per cent of the @entity99 ’s addresses every day , it is estimated			0
miss @entity101 said : ‘ @entity3 has a unique place in the @entity99 and that will not change			2
‘ we will now be better able to compete in what is a fast - changing and intensely competitive market			0
’ mr @entity80 said : ‘ today is an important day in the life of the @entity3			2
we have already committed to give eligible @entity3 staff a real stake by giving them 10 per cent of company shares free			2
‘ now the sale of government shares will give others a chance to have a real stake in this important company			0
’ however , critics claim most people are against the sale			0
@entity122 first minister @entity121 has vowed to reverse the move , and @entity124 last week voted to re-nationalise the group if it wins the election			1
labour business spokesman @entity127 said : ‘ this is in the face of huge opposition from the public and @entity3 ’s employees and a real concern about what the sale will mean for customers and communities			1
’ @entity138 's analysis consumers seeking a flutter on the £ 3.3billion @entity3 share offer will have to get their skates on			1
applications for a stake in @entity99 ’s emblematic letter and parcel delivery service must be in by october 8 , a remarkably narrow selling window			0
the government wants to make the shares as attractive as possible by offering a generous dividend of between 6.1 per cent and 7.7 per cent			0
at a time when bank deposit accounts pay virtually no interest and the return on ten - year government stocks , or gilts , is just 2.71 per cent , that is a tempting return			2
this is especially so because the company is promising a ‘ progressive ’ dividend policy			0
this means it should continue to rise at least at the rate of inflation in future years			0
generally speaking , people who took up privatisation shares in the past have done remarkably well , with @entity168 the outstanding performer , climbing 795 per cent since the @entity9 government sold it off in 1986			0
but like any share offering , the @entity3 retail sale will not be for the faint - hearted			1
like any share offering , the @entity3 retail sale will not be for the faint - hearted anyone picking up a share offer pack will be greeted with an alarming list of risks , from the need to invest in its it systems to the possibility that it could be affected by the vote on @entity122 independence			1
by far the biggest threats , however , come from the unions and the possible return of a @entity124 government in 2015 , which could try to take the @entity3 back into public ownership or impose price controls			1
there may be a strike soon after @entity3 reaches the markets , despite the fact that 10 per cent of the shares are reserved as freebies for the 150,000 - plus posties			2
in addition , it recently made one of the most generous three - year pay deals – at 8.6 per cent – for any industrial group			1
the key to the @entity3 ’s success will likely be its parcels service , which is highly profitable			1
as a ‘ royal ’ chartered enterprise , it pays no vat in @entity99 – although rivals are taking it to court over this issue			0
its main commercial challenge is the requirement to run a ‘ universal postal service ’ , which could be a costly anvil around its neck			0
but the biggest threat is that the @entity3 is snapped up by foreign buyers			2
that would be a tragedy for an organisation that traces its origins back to 1516 and is part of the fabric of the nation .			0

the sale could raise as much as £ 2billion for the @entity46
