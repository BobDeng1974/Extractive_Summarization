by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 08:11 est , 17 september 2013 gonorrhea has been classified as an urgent public - health threats in the @entity3 after it has grown drug - resistant gonorrhoea has been classified as an urgent public - health threat in the @entity3 after it has grown drug - resistant			2
at least 2 million people in the @entity3 develop serious bacterial infections that are resistant to one or more types of antibiotics each year , and at least 23,000 die from the infections , according to a new report			1
they also include diaorrhea - causing superbug @entity15 and a fast - growing killer ' nightmare ' bacteria dubbed a known as @entity17			1
it comes as experts warn we are fast approaching a ' post anti-biotic era ' where the ' cushion of drugs ' to protect us against diseases is gone			1
@entity25 of antibiotics has been held to blame for the increase in drug resistance			1
experts say it allows pathogens the opportunity to outwit the drugs used to treat them			1
and only a handful of new antibiotics have been developed and brought to market in the past few decades , with only a few companies working on drugs to replace them			1
dr @entity38 , director of the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , which released the report , said : ' for organism after organism , we 're seeing this steady increase in resistance rates			1
' we do n't have new drugs about to come out of the pipeline			2
if and when we get new drugs , unless we do a better job of protecting them , we 'll lose those , also			0
' @entity51 , acting director for the epidemiology and analysis program office at the @entity39 told @entity54 that bacterial resistance was identified shortly after antibiotics were first used in the 1940s , but that there had always been new drugs in the pipeline			1
but he said : ' the cushion of new antibiotics is gone			2
' we ’re right at the edge of this cliff where we ’re approaching the post-antibiotic era			1
” ' the first of its kind report was conceived to bring together as much information as possible about drug - resistant superbugs and how to slow their spread , with a hope of preserving the remaining drugs that still work , @entity38 said			0
drug - resistant @entity73 , causes 246,000 @entity3 cases of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea each year			0
the disease is increasingly becoming resistant to tetracycline , cefixime , ceftriaxone and azithromycin - formerly the most successful treatments for the disease			0
@entity83 is especially troublesome because it is easily spread , and infections are easily missed			0
in the @entity3 , there are approximately 300,000 reported cases , but because infected people often have no symptoms the @entity39 estimates the actual number of cases is closer to 820,000			0
if left untreated , gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease , ectopic pregnancy , stillbirths , severe eye infections in babies and infertility in men and women			0
' the three organisms that have been chosen as urgent are all increasing at an alarming rate to which therapies are limited , ' said dr @entity104 , an infectious disease expert at @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , and a member of the @entity111 's @entity110			0
@entity104 , who was not involved with the @entity39 report , said the pathogens in the urgent and serious categories - which include @entity115 , or @entity115 , and drug - resistant tuberculosis - are ' certainly worthy of immediate response			2
i do believe it 's a looming public - health crisis , ' he said			0
the @entity3 is not alone in raising the alarm over antibiotic drug resistance			0
last march @entity123 's chief medical officer for @entity123 said antibiotic resistance poses a ' catastrophic health threat '			0
they also include diaorrhea - causing superbug @entity15 ( pictured ) and a fast - growing killer ' nightmare ' bacteria dubbed a known as @entity17 that followed a report last year from the @entity133 that found a ' superbug ' strain of gonorrhea had spread to several @entity138 countries			1
the @entity39 report ranks the threat of drug - resistant superbugs into three categories - urgent , severe and concerning - based on factors such as their health and economic impacts , the total number of cases , the ease with which they are transmitted and the availability of effective antibiotics			2
among the top three threats deemed ' urgent ' is @entity17 , which @entity38 last march called a ' nightmare bacteria ' because even the strongest antibiotics are not effective against it			1
according to the report , @entity17 accounts for 9,300 healthcare - associated infections			0
the two most common types of @entity17 - carbapenem - resistant @entity157			0
and carbapenem - resistant e. coli - account for some 600 deaths each year			0
' for @entity17 , we 're seeing increases from 1 state to 38 states in the last decade , ' @entity38 said			2
and according to the report , @entity15 causes 250,000 infections and kills 14,000 people in the @entity3 each year , adding $ 1 billion annually in excess medical costs			1
deaths from @entity15 rose 400 percent from 2000 to 2007 due to the emergence of a drug - resistant strain of the bacteria .			1

experts have warned antibiotics are becoming *useless* against diseases
they include superbug @entity15 and killer ' nightmare ' bacteria cre
concerned experts warn we 're fast approaching ' post-antibiotic era '
