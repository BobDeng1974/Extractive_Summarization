whether it 's a cheeky monkey or a winking smiley , emojis have become a universal language to express how we 're feeling			0
but one designer claims that these characters fail to convey the emotions felt by introverts , such as the need to sneak off from a party , or to spend time reading			1
now , @entity13 - based artist @entity12 has changed this by creating more than 30 ' introjis ' that include activities typically associated with time spent alone			1
the ' @entity17 ' , created by @entity13 - based artist @entity12 , are designed to help introverts let loved ones know that they need their own space without providing a reason or excuse			1
activities shown here include leaving a party without telling anyone , listening to music , reading and recharging ' my boyfriend of three years broke up with me , citing the need for more time alone , ' she told @entity32			1
' i was surprised , as i 've always considered myself an introvert , too , but i realised that my enthusiasm about being in a relationship sometimes overshadows my ability to read others ' signals			2
' determined to create a better communication system for introverts , ms @entity12 came up with the concept of ' @entity43 '			1
she says this visual language helps let loved ones know ' that you need more time and space ' without having to provide a reason			2
the series of introjis also have characters that represent distress calls , in order for introverts to express when they are depressed or need company			1

in the centre is a introji to show someone is recharging while the right image depicts ' giving you space ' the left image shows a hangover , the centre image depicts spending time together relaxing , while the right image shows anxiety here characters convey activities such as reading , gaming , leaving stressful social situations and sneaking off from a party			1
' introverts tend to find the company of others draining , ' explains ms @entity12			1
' but communication is n't a one - way street			2
in the series , ms @entity12 designed certain icons with red backgrounds to indicate that the user does n't want company at the moment			1
meanwhile , images with blue and green backgrounds express that company is welcome			2
the series of introjis also have characters that represent distress calls , in order for introverts to express when they are depressed or need company			2
ms @entity12 is now hoping to transform her concept designs into a free app. she has created a @entity97 page to get suggestions from introverts on new designs			1
people who use emojis in text messages have more sex than those who do n't , according to @entity106 's annual dating survey			0
the @entity107 in @entity109 study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages , ethnicities , incomes and walks of life ; and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly than non-emoji users			0
the ' wink ' is the most widely used emoji overall , but when you separate men and women , men are more likely to pepper their texts with ' kiss ' and ' heart eyes ' emojis , while women prefer ' smileys '			0
according to biological anthropologist dr @entity131 , who helped lead the study , emojis are popular simply because they help us communicate more effectively in a medium in which sentiments can otherwise fall flat			0
' technology is dramatically changing how we court , but it ca nâ€™t change the brain systems for romance ' , she writes for @entity106			0
around 50 per cent of men and women agree that emojis ' show personality ' and around 35 per cent of both sexes say they make ' expressing feelings ' easier			0
just do n't spell your feelings wrong			0
the study also found that 54 per cent of single women and 36 per cent of men find misspellings and incorrect grammar to be the biggest text message turn - offs			0
the eyes have it : the ' wink ' is the most widely used emoji overall , but when you separate men and women , men are more likely to pepper their texts with ' kiss ' and ' heart eyes ' emojis , while women prefer ' smileys '			0
