thousands of people having keyhole knee surgery could be wasting their time , claim researchers			1
new research suggests that middle - aged people with mild osteoarthritis get little , if any , benefit as a result			1
a study investigated how best to treat torn meniscus , crescent - shaped cartilage that helps stabilise knees			1
in the @entity14 many patients have arthroscopic procedures either on the @entity16 or privately to reduce knee pain			1
thousands of people having keyhole knee surgery could be wasting their time , researchers have claimed this involves a procedure called debridement , which involves tidying up damaged cartilage and ligaments or removing loose debris from the joint			1
but a study published in the @entity29 found surgery is not more effective in the short or long - term than doing nothing			2
arthroscopy involves two small stab wounds made on either side of the front of the knee			0
one is for a telescope called an arthroscope , enabling the surgeon to see directly inside the area , and the other is for an instrument to carry out the surgery			0
surgeons typically smooth damaged cartilage surfaces on the end of bones , which can cause stiffness and pain , and flush out bone chips			0
the minimally invasive procedure allows for quicker healing than traditional surgery , but can still trigger complications such as blood clots , infection and nerve or blood vessel damage			0
during keyhole surgery , an arthroscopy , surgeons can smooth damaged cartilage surfaces on the end of bones , pictured is a computer generated image of cartilage @entity69 researchers analysed seven good quality trials , involving 811 knees in 805 patients , with an average age of 56 years			0
the procedure was carried out for symptom relief in patients with mild or no osteoarthritis , compared with similar patients who did not have arthroscopy for meniscal tears			0
in four trials there was no short - term pain relief in the first six months after surgery for patients with some osteoarthritis			1
there was no improvement in long - term function up to two years later in five trials			0
study leader dr @entity90 , division of @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , said : ‘ arthroscopic surgery for degenerative meniscal tears in the setting of mild or no concurrent osteoarthritis in middle - aged patients may have little , if any , effect on short - term and long - term outcomes in comparison with nonoperative management			1
’ he said doctors need to carefully weigh the costs and benefits when deciding which middle aged patients should undergo surgery			2
‘ with limited evidence supporting arthroscopic meniscal débridement for degenerative meniscus tears in the setting of mild or no osteoarthritis , an initial trial of nonoperative interventions should play a large role for middle - aged people , ’ he added			1
a 2008 @entity69 study found that patients undergoing surgery for knee arthritis did no better than those having physical therapy and taking medication			2
experts believe arthroscopy should not be used routinely to treat osteoarthritis , but say it may still help patients with mild symptoms or a recent injury			2
@entity16 guidelines recommend @entity135 only refer arthritis patients for arthroscopy when they suffer locking of the knee , not other symptoms .			0
