a menopause treatment which could prevent breast cancer , rather than causing it , may soon be available for @entity3 women			1
evidence shows the new hormone replacement therapy pill is even more effective at combating menopause symptoms , such as hot flushes , than the standard treatment			1
but crucially , early trials show it may prevent growth of breast cancer tumours			0
existing forms of @entity15 , by contrast , are thought to cause the disease			0
breast cancer : new @entity15 pill is better at combating menopause symptoms and it may prevent growth of breast cancer tumours researchers say it could be given to millions of women worldwide who are too afraid to take menopause treatment due to the risk of breast cancer			2
and they also believe it could be given to younger women with a strong family history of the disease to prevent it occurring			0
the pill – called @entity35 – has just been approved for use in @entity37 and will be available in chemists there from january			1
it is now being considered for use in @entity3 by the @entity43 watchdog – the @entity42 – which is expected to make a decision in the next few months			1
the drug contains the hormone oestrogen which combats symptoms of the menopause including hot flushes , night sweats , sleeping problems and thinning of the bones , or osteoporosis			1
but the problem with oestrogen , which is in standard @entity15 , is that it is thought to trigger the growth of cancer tumours			0
to combat this , a chemical called bazedoxifene is added to the @entity35 pill , blocking the cancer - causing effects of oestrogen			1
this means the drug has all the benefits of reducing menopause symptoms as normal hrt but does not trigger breast cancer			0
trials on 8,000 women have shown it reduces hot flushes by 85 per cent – making it more effective than standard @entity15 , which cuts them by 75 per cent			1
it also prevents fractures caused by bone thinning by 40 per cent and participants said it had improved their overall happiness			0
how previous pill was linked to disease but in tests on mice the chemical prevented the growth of breast cancer tumours – and scientists are convinced it will have the same effect on women			2
professor @entity89 of the @entity90 , who is an expert in the role of oestrogen in breast cancer , said : ‘ if this does what we think it does this is huge			0
’ unveiling the findings at the @entity101 conference in @entity102 , he added : ‘ i ’ve been around for 45 years studying breast cancer and when you look at the effects of these agents in animals , the animals have really predicted what ’s going to happen in patients			0
’ breast cancer is the most common form of the disease in women and in the @entity3 there are just under 50,000 new cases each year and 11,500 deaths			2
in 2001 and 2002 two major @entity37 studies suggested breast cancer was being triggered by @entity15 leading to millions of women worldwide abandoning the drug			2
in @entity3 , the numbers of women on @entity15 fell by half – only a million now take it today			1
doctors are concerned that many are suffering the debilitating symptoms of the menopause and putting themselves at risk of osteoporosis because they are too afraid to take @entity15			0
the new drug ’s manufacturer @entity131 has not revealed the cost of the pill – which would be taken once a day – but say it would be comparable to current forms of @entity15 , which is between £ 2 and £ 7 for a month ’s supply depending on the type			1
professor @entity89 said that if it was shown to prevent breast cancer , it could be given to thousands of younger women at high risk of the disease			0
this summer the @entity145 began offering these women the drug @entity148 , but it can have very unpleasant side effects such as depression , tiredness , blood clots , hot flushes and headaches			1
the professor said trials had so far shown the new pill had limited side effects			2
the drug could be available in @entity3 next year if the @entity43 watchdog approves it , although it may take several years to show it prevents breast cancer in humans .			0
