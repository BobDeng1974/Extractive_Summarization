by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail at 12.40pm on thursday in lane four of the @entity4 pool where he learnt to swim , @entity2 ’s @entity1 will begin his bid for @entity8 gold in heat three of the 200 metres breaststroke			1
he won silver in @entity12 four years ago , silver at the world short - course championships in 2012 and silver at the @entity17			1
it is now ‘ time to step up ’ , in his home town at his home @entity21			1
‘ i was always a bit wary of saying “ i want to win gold ” because i did n’t want to jinx it , ’ he said			2
‘ but everyone knows that ’s the result i want			2
this is the biggest event of my life			2
i feel like it ’s not just for me , it ’s for everybody			2
we ’re looking to win more medals than we have ever done , so i want to play my part in that			0
’ expectation will be pressing down on @entity1 ’s powerful shoulders as he dives into that pool			1
he has been training 30 hours a week for more than a decade , rising at 5.45am , practising until 10am , feeding up and then doing it all again from 2pm until 6pm			0
he is also the poster boy for these games and the timetable has been designed so he can , hopefully , get @entity2 off to a winning start			0
to his credit , @entity1 has embraced the hype and the swimmer has been talking to a sports psychologist to try to ensure he enjoys the experience , as well as achieving success			1
no pressure : @entity1 opens proceedings for @entity2 and will want a winning start ‘ the first time i had a taste of sports psychology was in the lead - in to @entity66 , ’ he says			1
‘ i wanted to walk out for the final and just be relaxed			0
now i know how to do that and the goal for me is getting the balance between enjoying the event — because it ’s my home games in my home town — and not putting too much pressure on myself			0
‘ but that ’s the lifestyle and i love it			0
i train to compete at events like the @entity21 , so i ’m so eager to make the most of it			1
’ pedigree : @entity1 won silver for @entity81 at the @entity17 @entity1 has been ‘ flogging ’ himself to ensure he arrives in @entity32 in the form of his life			1
he loves that aspect of his sport , but trying to push his body to its limits led to a heart scare late last year			1
he ‘ felt funny ’ during a weights session , but warmed up to swim anyway , dived in and then realised his heart - rate was through the roof			1
he was admitted to hospital with an irregular heartbeat			0
‘ they slow your heart - rate down and give you a bit of an electric shock and that re-sets it , ’ he explains			1
@entity1 describes this process very casually			1
he is wary of it being seen as an excuse for potential failure			0
he insists he does not feel any after - effects , but he knows the problem could have ended his career			0
‘ it was a strange situation , ’ he says			0
‘ at 25 , you do n’t expect to have heart problems — you ’re supposed to be in the shape of your life			2
i was pretty calm , but i had a 10 - minute period where i had a bit of a panic			0
‘ i was in the main theatre room and the doctor said , “ there ’s a 48 - hour window where , if a patient displays the same symptoms , we can treat it			0
outside that it becomes a bit more complicated and you might have to step away from swimming ”			0
‘ that made me think , “ i ’ve got to make the most of this ”			2
there is nothing to be worried about , but i ca n’t explain why it happened the first time and , if it happened again , i do n’t think i ’d be able to keep swimming			0
‘ it made me take stock and think i have to make the most of it			2
’ it is a thought that is driving on @entity1			1
for all the pressure that has been put on the @entity143 ahead of thursday ’s event , the greatest pressure still comes from within			0
seize the moment : after a heart scare last year @entity1 intends to make the most of his opportunity @entity1 is taking part in @entity150 this summer , a campaign to create a healthier nation and get more people swimming more regularly : www.swimbritain.co.uk @entity154 ready for 2014 @entity33			1

@entity1 competes in the @entity21 in his *hometown*
the @entity158 kicks off proceedings for @entity41 in the 200m breaststroke
@entity1 won silver in the @entity17 for @entity81
aiming to make the most of chance of success following heart scare in 2013
