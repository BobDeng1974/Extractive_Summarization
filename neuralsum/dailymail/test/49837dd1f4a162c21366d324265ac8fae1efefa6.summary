the @entity1 king blamed for sparking the violence against foreigners which has seen @entity6 's streets turn into battlefields running with blood over the past two weeks is no stranger to scandal			1
it was just a couple of years ago that @entity12 - who last month said foreigners should ' pack their belongings ' and leave - labelled homosexuals as ' rotten '			1
the dyed - in - the - wool traditionalist has also courted the wrath of women 's rights and hiv / aids campaigners for his hardline stance on controversial traditional virginity testing			1
zwelithini has been blamed for sparking outbursts of xenophobic violence like this @entity38 : the @entity12 is said to have told followers in a speech that foreigners were ' lice ' and ' ants ' and should be expelled from @entity6 - a charge he denies , saying it was bad translation frenzy : a burnt - out car in the @entity49 area of @entity28			1
@entity50 recently told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed ' this country would be reduced to ashes ' obscene : @entity56 arrives at the @entity57 in @entity58 in a @entity59 for her wedding to @entity50 in july			2
she became his sixth wife at the lavish ceremony @entity50 resurrected the outdated custom , in the face of widespread opposition , by claiming it helped the country 's fight against hiv / aids			2
but more recently , there was the revelation that he was bankrupt - despite the 54million rand ( £ 3million ) handed to him from the @entity6 government to keep the 67 - year - old , his six wives and 28 children in the style to which they are accustomed			1
and , as a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime , it is quite some lifestyle			0
while @entity50 continues to enjoy all the trappings of his royal status , @entity6 authorities arrested 11 men in @entity28 late on tuesday suspected of involvement in violence against immigrants , local television news reported			0
the men were held during a joint raid by the police and army on a @entity28 hostel			0
a wave of anti-immigrant violence has so far claimed seven lives in trouble spots in @entity27 and @entity28 , to where the government announced the deployment of defence forces on tuesday			0
a speech given by the @entity12 in @entity27 last month , denouncing foreigners as ' ants ' and ' lice ' who should leave the country , has been blamed for sparking the violence			1
the hellish scenes across townships in @entity6 are a far cry from @entity50 's opulent marriage to his sixth wife @entity56 , a 28 - year - old princess from the neighbouring kingdom of @entity120 , in july , which included a marquee , catering and flowers for 5,000 invited guests			1
according to @entity6 's @entity126 , the monarch paid out more than £ 55,000 on catering , around £ 10,000 on a sound system and £ 15,000 on decorations and flowers			2
in total , the extravaganza , attended by 5,000 people , cost an estimated £ 250,000			1
maintaining all six wives , their children and grandchildren in separate palaces , with generous allowances , private school fees and a retinue of personal staff , requires substantial funding , according to reports			0
and he decided they all needed new , imported military regalia to wear to the opening of @entity148 's state legislature later this year - at the not insignificant price of £ 155,000 , the @entity126 claimed			1
defence : @entity12 also claimed his words were badly translated in 2012 when he called gay people ' rotten ' nuptials : his wedding to sixth wife @entity56 ( pictured ) in july cost an estimated @entity155 , or about £ 250,000 opulent : another scene from @entity56 's wedding to the king			1
she was selected as his bride at the age of 18 while participating in the 2003 @entity120 reed dance power : @entity12 's speech last month is said to be the cause of the violence which has turned the streets into a battleground , sending foreigners running for the safety of special camps luxurious : but the @entity12 - pictured here right at the annual reed dance at @entity173 last year - more often comes under fire for lavish spending on his six wives , 28 children and numerous grandchildren funding : @entity12 is given @entity179 ( about £ 3million ) by the @entity6 government each year but that is not to say the @entity12 , who became leader of @entity6 's biggest tribal group aged just 20 in 1968 , does not have previous form on exorbitant expenditure			1
in 2012 , @entity50 asked for half a million pounds for a new palace for @entity187 @entity56 - as well as an extra million pounds on fifth wife @entity187 @entity189 's home , in @entity190 , which boasts five royal residences			1
four years before , the royal family had come under fire for spending more than £ 16,000 on linen			0
and just last month , the @entity126 reported that the @entity12 had bought each of his queens a new @entity198 sedan , in addition to a seventh model ' as a back up '			1
the monarch 's opulent lifestyle is in stark contrast to millions of @entity6 who , more than two decades after winning freedom , still do not have access to basic services such as clean water and electricity			2
but despite opposition politicians hitting out at the huge amounts lavished upon @entity50 and his family , it is unlikely to change			0
as @entity6 celebrates 21 years of democracy next week , the largesse enjoyed by the king at the taxpayers ' expense appears assured – at least while controversial president and fellow @entity221 clings to power			0
mr @entity221 , who himself has four wives and at least 20 children , has relied on the influential leader to deliver political support , both to him personally and the governing @entity228			0
@entity229 : the new @entity12 celebrate during their wedding , yet @entity12 is a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime bankrupt : but the @entity12 ( centre ) ran out of money last year following a particularly expensive few months , and had to beg for more funds - which the government , led by fellow @entity221 ( left ) , approved households : the @entity12 has also asked for more than a million pounds to build or renovate his wives ' palaces followers : but despite the extravagances , the @entity12 - pictured with prince @entity245 in 2011 - is still adored by millions of people , many impoverished , willing to follow his every instruction raid : @entity1 hostel dwellers on the staircase during a joint @entity252 and army raid in @entity28 yesterday			1
the raid was aimed at tackling gangs which have been hunting down and killing foreigners hands up : @entity1 up against a wall waiting to be searched during the police raid on the hostel last night fearful : potential gang members lie face down on the floor during the police and army action at the hostel in return , the king enjoys a budget far higher than @entity6 's other royal households and chiefdoms			2
indeed , the @entity6 government waved through an extra two million rand ( £ 110,600 ) just last month , to help him get to the end of the financial year			2
what 's more , his allowance looks set to rise to @entity275 ( £ 3.5million ) a year by 2017			2
and none of this takes into account the amount the @entity6 taxpayer is having to shoulder thanks to the inflammatory speech he gave in march			0
' we ask the foreign nationals to pack their belongings and go back to their countries , ' he said during the speech in @entity27			0
@entity50 has blamed bad reporting for his alleged hate speech , yet his attempt to call for calm this week contained a clear , but rather chilling hint at the power the firebrand believes he wields over his predominantly impoverished , young followers			0
he told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed ' this country would be reduced to ashes '			0
even so , the @entity6 government has been forced to declare ' an emergency ' over the issue , ordering troops onto the streets of its most volatile townships where disaffected locals have been ransacking shacks in search of migrants they accuse of stealing job and business opportunities			0
at least 7,000 foreigners are sheltering in camps for their safety and more than 900 have fled , including to @entity315 where despot @entity317 's government has likened the monarch 's alleged remarks to those made in the run up to the genocide in @entity323 20 years ago			2
outcast : there are about 7,000 foreigners sheltering in special camps in @entity27 and @entity28			0

@entity12 allegedly compared foreigners to ' ants ' and ' lice '
back in 2012 the 67 - year - old told followers homosexuals were ' rotten '
but father - of - 28 's lavish lifestyle with his six wives is equally controversial
last year he declared himself bankrupt having spent £ 250,000 on wedding
yet just last month he bought a @entity198 for each wife - plus a spare
