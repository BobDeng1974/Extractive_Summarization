by @entity0 ' the opportunities are enormous ' : drilling for shale gas should take place ' all over rural parts of the @entity7 ' , @entity2 has declared drilling for shale gas should take place ‘ all over rural parts of the @entity7 ’ , @entity2 has declared			1
the environment secretary risks a clash with green groups over his plans for the controversial technology , but says @entity7 must cash in on gas trapped in rocks deep underground to ‘ create prosperity and jobs ’			2
he said shale has already dramatically reduced gas prices in the @entity22 , now a net exporter of energy , and it would be done safely in @entity7			2
‘ the opportunities here are enormous , ’ he said during questioning by a @entity26 committee yesterday			1
‘ i would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the @entity7			0
’ mr @entity2 said opponents of fracking , such as those who besieged an exploratory well in @entity35 in @entity36 last year , were ‘ doing a good job at alarming the public ’ and admitted that the government had to do more to convince the country of its benefits			1
and he said the supporters of fracking had to make their voices heard , as he conceded opponents are currently getting their message across more effectively on @entity47 and @entity48			1
‘ we have to be more glass half - full ’ , mr @entity2 said			1
‘ the fact is i would like to see shale gas exploited all over rural parts of the @entity7			0
we need to get on the front foot			0
’ the shale gas thought to be beneath @entity55 alone could meet @entity7 ’s need for half a century			0
@entity57 has thrown his weight behind a drilling programme and offered generous tax breaks for fracking firms announced in january			2

mr @entity2 said ‘ it really is important to convince people			1
there is absolutely no way we are cutting corners or cutting down the rigour of our environmental regulation , and done professionally and properly there is nothing to fear			0

opposition : mr @entity2 said opponents of fracking , such as these who besieged an exploratory well in @entity35 , @entity36 , last year , were ' doing a good job at alarming the public ' @entity92 ’s @entity91 hit back : ‘ amidst the usual jumble of bogus claims and exaggerations , @entity2 has spoken one embarrassing truth - the government has failed to convince the public that fracking is safe			1
' this is why ministers are planning to speed up the issuing of fracking permits whilst stripping away legal protections for homeowners who do n’t want companies drilling under their homes			2

@entity2 tells @entity109 ' the opportunities are enormous '
he says opponents of fracking are ' doing a good job of alarming the public '
but @entity92 *accuses* him of merely making a ' jumble of bogus claims '
