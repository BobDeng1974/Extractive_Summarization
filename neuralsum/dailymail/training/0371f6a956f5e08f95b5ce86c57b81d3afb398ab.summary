by @entity0 published : 16:40 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 21:13 est , 28 january 2014 for @entity3 it was a moment of madness : he showed his studs and is set for a four - match ban			1
the consequence of his reckless challenge , when he launched himself two - footed at @entity10 10 minutes from time , will hit @entity12 hard as he will miss @entity14 games against @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 and the @entity19 clash with @entity16			1
to do what he did to a fellow professional is disrespectful and dangerous			0
pegged back : @entity24 's @entity23 , centre , celebrates scoring his equaliser against @entity12 marching orders : @entity12 's @entity3 , in yellow , is given a red card by referee @entity30 yellow peril : @entity12 midfielder @entity32 , centre , celebrates scoring his side 's second against @entity24 @entity36 connection : @entity12 striker @entity37 celebrates scoring the equaliser against @entity24 click here for our brilliant @entity40 @entity24 : @entity42 5 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 7 , @entity45 5 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 5 , @entity10 5 , @entity48 5 ( @entity49 90 ) , @entity23 7 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 ( @entity52 70 , 6 )			1

manager : @entity80 5 att : 31,284 referee : @entity30 ( @entity82 ) 7 man of the match : @entity23 * @entity86 ratings by @entity0 at @entity87 's when you play for a team chasing their first title since 2004 — and have served a ban for five bookings so receive a longer suspension for a dismissal — it is also rank stupidity			1
sadly , it also means @entity24 's outstanding performance is of secondary importance			2
instead it felt as though @entity12 ’s season could be shaped by @entity3 ’s dismissal			2
the advantage has swung the way of their title rivals and @entity108 ’s @entity107 will go top if they beat @entity110 on wednesday evening			2
@entity111 are also waiting in the wings			2
@entity24 played this game at full throttle , taking the lead when @entity44 converted @entity46 's teasing left wing cross			1
to @entity12 's credit they recovered from a dreadful first half to level through @entity37 and then went ahead with a delicious strike from @entity32			1
to see @entity12 panic as they did in the first half and for much of the second , when they were unable to put their foot on the ball , was extraordinary			0
@entity62 ’s team were full of exuberance , feeding off the raw , rampant enthusiasm of @entity51 in his first @entity14 start			0
at the age of just 18 he has the makings of a proper player , making life hell for @entity137 and @entity65			0
the kid did n’t give them any rest			0
equaliser : @entity23 score @entity24 's second goal against @entity12 vital strike : @entity32 scored @entity12 's second against @entity24 i will take that : @entity12 defender @entity65 wins the ball off @entity24 's @entity50 showing no fear : @entity24 's @entity51 was excellent against @entity12 in his first @entity14 start watching on : @entity24 manage @entity62 runs to the aid of his injured left - back @entity46 during the @entity12 match february 2 : @entity152 ( h ) february 8 : @entity154 ( a ) february 12 : @entity155 ( h ) february 15 : @entity16 - @entity19 ( h ) to play as he did , against a team with the best defensive record in the @entity14 , was something special			1
@entity51 , pinched from @entity163 ’s youth team two years ago , played because @entity165 ’s hamstring injury ruled him out			0
he inspired @entity24 ’s opening charge , linking brilliantly with @entity23 , @entity50 and the lung - busting runs of @entity168 down the right			1
@entity80 ’s team were untidy , sluggish and sloppy ; careless in possession as @entity24 built up a head of steam			2
@entity51 ’s early strike drew a save from @entity63 , flying to his right to tip the ball away for a corner			0
@entity24 took the lead in the 21st minute			2
@entity46 put in the hard yards , buying some time and space down the left and his cross was met by the head of @entity44 at the far post			2
they could have been two up when @entity51 ’s effort inside the six - yard box hit a post			2
opening strike : @entity24 's @entity44 , left , scores the first goal of the match against @entity12 at @entity87 's as half - time approached @entity80 was desperate to get his team back down that tunnel and at the break he tweaked his system , encouraging his side to be more adventurous whenever they were in possession			1
within minutes of the restart they were level when @entity64 , in an advanced position for the first time in the game , poked the ball into @entity37 ’s path			0
the @entity12 forward improvised , turning @entity64 ’s ball beyond @entity42 for the equaliser			0
it was a special strike			0
@entity24 were stunned , conceding again when @entity32 ’s sweetly struck effort on the edge of the area beat the @entity218 goalkeeper			1
it was a remarkable turnaround for @entity12 , but @entity24 responded with an equaliser of their own after 54 minutes			0
making his mark : @entity12 midfielder @entity68 keeps a close eye on @entity24 's @entity168 tough night : @entity80 says the red card was harsh on @entity3 as @entity12 drew 2 - 2 @entity23 read @entity50 ’s cut - back and steered @entity24 ’s equaliser beyond @entity63			1
it was a stunning response			0
@entity12 poured forward for the winner and @entity42 looked beaten when @entity32 ’s chip was somehow deflected on to the top of the crossbar			0
@entity63 rescued @entity12 again when he tipped @entity44 ’s effort around the post three minutes from time			0
@entity3 , who will start his ban on sunday against @entity15 , was nowhere near as lucky			1
start of @entity24 ' march : @entity44 enjoys opening the scoring against @entity12			1

@entity23 strike gives @entity24 a share of spoils at @entity87 's
@entity3 sent off after reckless challenge on @entity10
he will miss @entity15 , @entity17 and two @entity16 clashes
*saints* took the lead through @entity44 's first - half goal
*gunners* hit back through @entity37 and @entity32
draw gives @entity107 and @entity111 chance to close gap in title race
