by @entity0 published : 21:19 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 21:19 est , 15 september 2012 thousands of striking @entity2 public school teachers and their allies packed a city park saturday in a boisterous show of force as union leaders and the district tried to work out the details of an agreement that could end a week - long walkout			1
pushing strollers , toting signs and towing wagons of children , thousands of red - shirted teachers cheered and chanted as speaker after speaker urged them to stand firm until they have a deal in writing			1
they told the teachers that their strike was a symbol of hope for public teachers and other unions that have been losing ground around the nation			2
' i believe this is a very strong turning point when you have so many people coming out to fight alongside ( the teachers union )			1
' months of contract negotiations came down to two main issues : job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on student test scores			1
@entity39 leaders who announced a framework for a deal on friday said they would not end the strike - the first in @entity2 in 25 years - until they see a proposal in writing			1
saturday 's talks were aimed at settling on the exact language , and both sides were hopeful that the nearly 800 - member @entity75 could vote sunday to suspend the strike so children could be back in class on monday			2
addressing demonstrators saturday , @entity39 president @entity38 cautioned that ' we are on strike ' and that classes wo n't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support			0
the rev. @entity87 also addressed the crowd , saying the strike was a ' struggle for working people everywhere ' and that there was still a long road to ensuring all residents of the city have equal access to quality schools , especially in neighborhoods beset by gang violence and poverty			2
the mission : months of negotiations came down to two main issues : job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on test scores go get it : residents of a west side @entity2 neighborhood cheer public school teachers as they march after the rally ' our mission is very clear : we fight for equal , high - quality public education for all , ' @entity87 said			1
' when school opens again there will be 160 schools without a public library			0
... when school opens again , there will be schools yet without books			0
so we fight today for schools on the @entity127 and @entity128 to look like schools on the @entity130			0
' saturday 's talks took place at the offices of union attorney @entity134			2
on his way into the talks , @entity39 vice president @entity135 was optimistic that timetable was still possible			0
' we 're hopeful that we can do it but frankly like i said , the devil is in the details of this contract and we want it in writing , ' he told reporters			0
' we 're going to go in today and hammer ( out ) the details			0
' @entity39 members from @entity149 , @entity150 and elsewhere joined saturday 's rally in show of solidarity			0
for @entity149 teachers , the rally also served as a moment to celebrate a judge 's friday ruling striking down nearly all of a contentious state law championed by @entity161 gov. @entity161 that had effectively ended collective bargaining rights for most public workers			0
raging mad : a young boy , left , and a woman , right , hold signs critical of @entity2 mayor @entity168 @entity161 's administration immediately vowed to appeal , while unions , which have vigorously fought the law , declared victory			1
' people are energized by this , ' said @entity175 a high school social studies teacher from @entity177 who came to the rally with a busload of others			0
' i think that the line has to be drawn in terms of teacher bashing , union bashing and privatization of education			1
these forces and factors are not just in @entity2 , not just in @entity149 , but across the nation and ( @entity2 ) happens to be the spear point			1
' mayor @entity168 , who has blasted the union for engaging in a ' strike of choice , ' sounded optimistic friday , saying ' the tentative framework is an honest and principled compromise that is about who we all work for : the students			0
' the walkout in the nation 's third - largest school district canceled five days of class for more than 350,000 public school students who had just returned from summer vacation			2
until this week , @entity2 teachers had not walked out since 1987 , when they were on strike for 19 days .			1
