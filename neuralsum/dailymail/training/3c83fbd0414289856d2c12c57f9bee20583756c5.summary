@entity0 is looking to pull off a notable double when @entity2 visit @entity3 in the fifth - round of the @entity5 on monday			1
@entity0 was the manager of @entity6 five years ago when they stunned @entity2 1 - 0 in the third - round , ending a near 30 - year wait for a victory at @entity11			1
it is 43 years since @entity3 have faced the @entity13 and more than 55 years since their last win but , having done it once , @entity0 sees no reason why he can not oversee another shock			1
@entity3 boss @entity0 is backing his side to shock @entity2 in the @entity5 fifth - round @entity20 scored the goal in a famous 1 - 0 victory for @entity23 at @entity11 back in 2010 he said : ' every time i go to @entity6 people remind me about it			1
it 's a different football club , different personnel , but i 'll draw from the experience and what a great feeling it was to win at @entity11 that day			1
' you do n't get the opportunity to do that very often			0
i want to try to replicate that if possible			0
you have to have that belief that you can do it			0
' @entity6 ' match - winner , @entity20 , rejoined his old manager on loan from @entity42 in november but his chances of more heroics have been scuppered by an ear infection			1
' it 's affected his balance and he 's been having dizzy spells			0
it actually might make him a little bit brighter and better as a person but he 'll be unavailable for the game unfortunately , ' said @entity0 with a smile			1
' it would have been a fantastic fairy tale if he 'd been available for us			0
we were contemplating trying to sign @entity57 to find him with a pass ! ' not that @entity3 are short of a goal threat			1
at 37 , @entity60 remains a player more than capable of making life uncomfortable for @entity64 defences while @entity66 's five goals make him the competition 's leading scorer this season			0
at 37 , experienced striker @entity60 still knows how to make life awkward for @entity64 defences @entity3 midfielder @entity66 ( left ) is actually the @entity5 's top scorer this season with five goals but it is @entity74 of whom @entity2 will probably be most wary			1
the 26 - year - old has scored 14 times this season , including a brace against @entity79 on tuesday on his first start since suffering a shin injury in november			2
@entity0 said : ' he 's our talisman and to have him back gave everybody a boost			1
' we have n't rushed him back and it 's as if he 's never been away			0
he was moaning at me the other night when i took him off with 10 minutes to go because he wanted to get a hat - trick , and that 's the mark of a player			2
' i 'm sure if @entity2 's players are not aware of him at this moment , come monday night they will be because he ruffles a few feathers			2
' @entity2 and manager @entity92 may be under the microscope over their style of play at the moment but @entity0 is well aware there remains a huge gap between the top of @entity100 and the top of the @entity64			1
after three successive wins , the @entity102 do not lack confidence , though , and @entity0 said of the challenge : ' i think it 's got to inspire them			2
' you 've got to go into a game like this and enjoy it			0
our players may never get the chance to play against the likes of @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 etc again			0
' the one thing you have to say to them before they go out is have no regrets			0
we know the task that 's against us because of what they are and what they 're capable of doing but we 've got nothing to lose and they 've got everything to lose			0
' there 's always one shock , there 's always a hero , and hopefully it 's going to be a @entity102 player			0
' @entity74 has scored 14 times this season , including a brace against @entity79 on tuesday should @entity3 pull off the upset , it would be fitting timing , with the game coming just two days after the first anniversary of the death of their greatest ever player , sir @entity144			1
@entity144 was in the team when @entity147 reached the final in 1954 , 16 years after they lifted the trophy for the second and last time			0
' this football club has got fantastic history and tradition , ' said @entity0			2
' it 's quite poignant that this weekend is the first anniversary of his death so it would be a fantastic way to mark what he did for this football club			0
' the @entity3 boss , meanwhile , is also preparing to take part in a bicycle ride from @entity160 to @entity161 in june in aid of @entity164 @entity163			2
@entity0 's best friend , @entity165 , died from the disease last september			2
@entity3 will have to be at their best if they are to overcome @entity2 's star - studded line - up @entity92 is targeting @entity5 glory in his first season in charge at @entity2 @entity2 are currently third in the @entity64 table and are aiming to qualify for the @entity173			1

@entity0 wants @entity3 to upset @entity2 in the @entity5
he managed @entity6 to a famous 1 - 0 victory at @entity11 in 2010
@entity3 are currently *fourth* in the @entity100 table
