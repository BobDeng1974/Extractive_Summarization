by @entity0 and @entity1 builders have rubbished claims that thousands of diggers are being buried under @entity6 houses when excavation work has finished			1
it was claimed the equipment is left at the bottom of the luxury homes belonging to @entity6 's super-rich - who are increasingly expanding their properties downwards to get round tight planning regulations			1
the heavy machinery is needed to hollow out the ground to make way for swimming pools , cinemas , garages and other trappings of wealth			0
but , according to the new theory , many of the projects are so ambitious the diggers are left with no way to dig their way out again			0
construction : when basement excavations on @entity6 flats are finished , the diggers used are allegedly left in the ground because it is cheaper than bringing it back to street level ( file picture ) the strategy is often used for major infrastructure projects , such as the @entity40 , during which one boring machine dug itself into the ground to let the others pass			1
the strategy could fuel further outrage over the trend for ' iceberg homes ' , which has led wealthy residents of @entity6 's most well - to - do boroughs to complain en masse - even taking their grievances to the @entity50			1
construction apparently workers cover the entombed machinery with earth and concrete , leaving it stuck underground instead			0
earlier this week , @entity57 from the @entity59 magazine said equipment discarded under @entity6 was worth around £ 5million			1
he wrote : ' first , a crane would have to be hired ; second , the entire street would need to be closed for a day while the crane was maneuvered into place			0
' both of these stages were very expensive , not to mention unpopular among the distinguished local residents			0
' the phenomenon reportedly came to light when conversion specialists contracted to build ' sub-basement ' extensions to homes which had already been enlarged found the leftover machinery when they started digging			2
row : around £ 5million worth of equipment is thought to have been discarded around @entity6 , but builders say the claims are ' complete nonsense ' however , a top @entity6 builder has said that the claims are rubbish - and that the economics do n't stack up because @entity6 floorspace is so valuable			1
@entity82 from @entity6 developers @entity83 , has said the claims are rubbish and make no commercial sense			1
he told the @entity87 : ' with the basement space worth up to £ 8,000 per sq ft why would someone leave such valuable space filled with dumped equipment and fill in concrete ? ' much more valuable to extract and have as sellable space – oligarchs are rich but not stupid			1
' but if the strategy has migrated to private homes in @entity6 , it would be yet another sign of the heights to which the capital 's property market has soared			1
the average @entity6 home is now worth £ 459,000 , according to the @entity103			1
extravagant : multi-storey basement extensions - such as the one above planned by @entity106 heir @entity105 - are becoming more and more common ' it 's shocking ' : actress @entity108 says there is ' too much building work going on ' in her @entity6 neighbourhood developers said the loss of expensive equipment would also be costly to property developers and would risk breaking stringent @entity117 procedures			1
@entity118 , managing director of @entity119 added that the suggestion was ' utterly ludicrous ' and there are always procedures that can make sure the digger is taken out			0
' @entity123 ' : @entity125 guitarist @entity124 has complained about works near his home in @entity128 wealthy homeowners are digging downwards rather than sideways or outwards to fit in saunas , swimming pools , gyms , home cinemas and even workers ' quarters			2
actress @entity108 expressed the outrage of many earlier this year , hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket @entity139 - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes			2
the dynasty actress , 80 , told a residents ' maagzine : ' it 's really sad			0
i find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year			0
' @entity125 guitarist @entity124 also took umbrage at building work near his @entity128 home			2
writing online last month he said : ' @entity128 used to be a nice quiet decent place to live ... now it ’s becoming a hellhole '			0
well - heeled residents have started to hit back - in june of last year @entity158 , @entity159 , joined 57 other resident in @entity161 in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her @entity165 street			2
the 77 - year - old peer said : '' these sorts of basements are being built all over @entity169 , but it 's a conservation area and it 's not in keeping with the street			0
' also in 2013 , a group of @entity169 residents including @entity174 instructed lawyers to seek an injunction from the @entity50 to stop their council approving a bid for an underground swimming pool			0
over the last five years , there have been 800 planning applications for basements in @entity128 and @entity128 alone .			0

equipment is allegedly being left *undergound* when excavations are finished
follows the trend of basement extensions *underneath* @entity6 homes
builders have said claims made last week are ' complete nonsense '
*columnist* claimed total number of *vehicles* discarded is worth £ 5million
could fuel *opposition* to ' iceberg homes ' trend - *voice* by likes of @entity124
