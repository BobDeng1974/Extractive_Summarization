a stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers for the first time			1
the extremely rare phenomenon caused by stellar debris being consumed by the hole has never been observed before			1
known as ' relativistic jets ' , they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length			1
stunning : this illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star			1
such an event took place four billion light years from @entity18 @entity20 's @entity19 ( white , purple ) and x-ray telescopes ( yellow and red ) showing the bursts most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core , with masses of millions or even billions of suns			1
scientists were first alerted to the phenomenon in march after @entity40 's @entity20 telescope detected several bursts of x-rays from a quiet patch of sky			1
teams from both @entity46 and the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9billion light years away			1
as a star falls toward a black hole , it is ripped apart by intense tides			2
the gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of degrees			2
the innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole , where rapid motion and magnetism create dual , oppositely directed ' funnels ' through which some particles may escape			2
@entity71 driving matter at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the black hole 's spin axis			2
in the case of @entity78 +57 , one of these jets happened to point straight at @entity18			0
dr @entity81 , from @entity46 which controls @entity20 , said chemical analysis of the bright flash 's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns			0
writing in @entity90 , they concluded that the @entity20 satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light			0
dr @entity81 said : ' incredibly , this source is still producing x-rays and may remain bright enough for the @entity20 satellite to observe into next year			0
it behaves unlike anything we 've seen before			0
' the swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy			1
the black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star			0
the absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black @entity117 - massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses			0
by comparison , the sun is just one solar mass and the @entity18 is 1/332,950th of a solar mass.			0

astronomers watch as @entity40 telescope *captures* rare event
phenomenon only occurs once every *100million* years
