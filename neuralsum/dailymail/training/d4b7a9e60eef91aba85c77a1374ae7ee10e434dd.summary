the world ’s most extraordinary woman athlete ? those who love athletics and tennis and all the other sports in which women are achieving amazing things will have their favourites , no doubt			0
but if there is anyone right now who is coming close to matching the feats of the remarkable @entity14 , i ’ll be most impressed			2
indeed , the only thing that might cost her marks is that she is barely a woman at all			0
she is only 17 , for heaven ’s sake , and yet ruling the world in a sport in which a player ’s prime years are usually considered to be around twice her age			0
becoming world no 1 three weeks ago was astounding enough , but how she would cope was the acid test			1
think of @entity28 , who could not handle reaching the summit in the men ’s game in his mid- 20s			0
or @entity32 , who won majors for fun for a while but admitted her relief when she was finally relieved of the mantle			0
@entity14 holds the @entity39 trophy following her victory in @entity41 on sunday @entity42 has shot her way to the top of the world rankings at just 17 years old @entity46 ’s mother @entity45 could not hide her anxiety , tugging her hair and exclaiming : ‘ headache			1
she ’s too young to be no 1			0
’ so it was that @entity46 , born in @entity51 but a proud @entity52 , assumed the awesome responsibility at the @entity39 last week			1
the venue was @entity41 , one of the world ’s best courses and a test so devilish it would trip up any pretender			0
could she live up to her billing ? as ever , @entity46 took it all in her uniquely impressive stride			2
even when she stumbled early on during the final round on sunday she did not panic , getting back on track with a spectacular eagle three			0
@entity46 was the centre of attention in @entity41 and took time to sign autographs for keen fans @entity46 is coached by @entity71 who is best - known for tutoring sir @entity72 @entity46 has won nine times as a professional with six of her victories coming on the difficult @entity76 ‘ that ’s @entity14 , ’ says her coach @entity71 , who achieved fame tutoring sir @entity72			1
‘ she walks on this cloud and never gets overly excited or overly down			0
’ just to remind the world of her age , @entity46 broke into a fit of giggles walking down the 72nd fairway before putting the finishing touches to a classy two - shot victory			1
it was , believe it or not , her ninth win as a professional , and six of them have been achieved on the @entity76 , the toughest circuit in the women ’s game			1
this week she goes home to play in the @entity101 , an event she won as a 15 - year - old amateur			2
if @entity46 remains true to her word , we must enjoy her performances while we can			2
far from becoming burned out at 30 , she plans to retire and seek a second career as a sports psychologist			0
do you think she would have any trouble attracting leading sportswomen to pay top dollar to learn her secrets ? quote of the week ‘ if @entity118 wants to say what he said , it ’s up to him			1
but if i had a losing record like his in the @entity122 , i ’d just keep my mouth shut			2
’ @entity124 was not so merry in an interview last week when asked about the lefty ’s now infamous mutiny at @entity128 last year , when he publicly criticised captain @entity129 in the wake of yet another defeat at the hands of @entity133			2
@entity118 , who has played in 10 @entity134 and finished on the winning side just twice , currently trails @entity136 by one point to see who can run up the most losing matches in @entity141 @entity122 history			1
on tuesday , the @entity142 will announce @entity143 will be the next skipper , thereby giving him the chance to atone for being on the wrong end of the sporting miracle that occurred at @entity147 in 2012			0
@entity148 was unimpressed with @entity118 's behaviour following the @entity141 side 's loss at @entity128 @entity118 ( centre ) publicly criticised captain @entity129 following @entity133 's victory in @entity154 @entity155 is one in a million let ’s see			1
your brother helped @entity133 win the @entity122 on three occasions and proved , by near unanimous consent , to be the best captain @entity133 has ever had in masterminding victory at @entity128 last year			1
how on earth do you emerge from such a particularly large golfing shadow ? with a feat that has become the talk of the golf community in the @entity169 , @entity165 somewhat managed it last week			1
the vast majority of club golfers would be thrilled to achieve three holes - in - one over the course of a lifetime			1
@entity165 , younger brother of @entity176 , achieved three in the space of six days			1
captain @entity178 is doused in champagne following his team 's @entity122 triumph last september a plus - one golfer at the impressive @entity185 course , the @entity169 resident mustered the first of his aces at the difficult par - three fourth at @entity188 — home to the @entity190 each november — using a four - iron			2
he came up with another at the fifth on his home course a couple of days later before demonstrating that good things really can come in threes by holing out once more during his next round , with a nine - iron at the eighth			0
‘ i had a hole - in - one when i was 15 but had n’t had one since , so to have three in six days is an amazing , incredible feeling , ’ he said			0
clearly , when it comes to this sport , such feelings rather run in the family .			0
