@entity1 's dressing - room brains trust will take on an extra dimension if @entity3 , the @entity4 spin - bowling all - rounder , makes his international debut against @entity6 in @entity7 on may 8			1
the 23 - year - old @entity3 , who celebrated his call - up with four @entity9 wickets at @entity10 , graduated from @entity11 two years ago with a double first in politics and sociology			1
he is halfway through a 40,000 - word masters on the 1960s civil rights movement in the @entity18 south , and plays the piano to a high level			2
it 's fair to say he would be @entity1 's most academically gifted cricketer since @entity22 – another @entity11 double first – won three test caps in 2003			1
@entity4 's @entity25 been called up to @entity1 's @entity26 for the clash against @entity6 the left - handed batsman and left - arm spinner also has an eye on a career in academia one day ' i think my @entity4 team - mates enjoy having someone to talk to about things they do n't think about or talk about necessarily , ' @entity3 told @entity37			1
' i try to use the studies to avoid taking cricket too seriously			0
i think cricket is a sport , and is n't that important in the grand scheme of things			0
my studies and cricket are tools for each other , and i do try to see them in those instrumental ways			0
' @entity3 , part of a young @entity1 squad picked with the @entity52 in mind , opens in four - day cricket for his county , but bats in the middle order in limited - overs matches , bowls accurate left - arm spin and is an athletic fielder			1
@entity1 almost chose him for the test tour of the @entity62			2
@entity63 will captain @entity1 against @entity6 ' playing in @entity64 would be nerve - wracking because of the exposure , ' he said			1
' but when it comes to one - day cricket , i feel the gap between international and county cricket maybe is n't as big as between test cricket and the second division			0
' @entity3 's rise was accelerated by his five - wicket haul for @entity76 against @entity4 back in 2011 , when he removed @entity77 for 30 and helped the students to a 10 - wicket win			1
@entity77 , now a county team - mate , was going through a difficult patch against left - arm spinners , but @entity3 insists the pair have not spoken about the dismissal			1
' it 's never come up , ' he said			0
' i do n't know if it was a touchy issue for him at the time , but it was a touchy issue in general			0
anyone could have got him out – it just happened to be me			0
' @entity3 spent three weeks in @entity91 over the winter with @entity93 , where he talked about the art of left - handed batting with @entity96 and @entity97 , and life as a spin bowler with @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
he is juggling his time between playing for @entity4 and writing up his dissertation at @entity106 's @entity105			2
he does n't rule out a phd or a career in academia			0
if so , he would follow the path of his father , @entity111 , who hails from @entity112 in @entity113 , settled in @entity1 in his teens because his own father was an engineer in the @entity116 , and was awarded an obe 13 years ago for his work on race relations			2
@entity3 's @entity121 mother is a historian			2
between now and may 8 , the dissertation may have to wait its turn			0
' i 'd love to give it a go with @entity1 , ' he said			2
' things can happen quickly			0
a couple of good performances and it starts to snowball			0
' @entity130 a promising seam bowler who can bat a bit , the 22 - year - old @entity130 emerged through the ranks of @entity136 cricket before joining @entity137			0
took 43 championship wickets last season at an average of 26			0
@entity142 @entity146 's seam - bowling all - rounder was man of the match in the final of the 2013 domestic twenty20 tournament			1
son of former @entity1 all - rounder @entity150 , he celebrated his call - up with a typically hard - hitting fifty against @entity152			1
he 's a left - armer too , which is all the rage after the @entity52			1
his county captain @entity155 reckons he 's ' the @entity156 '			0
@entity157 an explosive keeper - batsman at @entity160 , the 23 - year - old @entity158 thrashed 458 runs in last season 's @entity162 at an average of 114 and a strike - rate of 154			2
made @entity1 's provisional 30 - man @entity52 squad when @entity168 withdrew because of an eye injury .			1

@entity1 have called up @entity3 to their squad for odi against @entity6
@entity4 all - rounder is a *top* - order batsman and left - arm spinner
but he is also a gifted academic , with a double first from @entity11
@entity3 could be @entity1 's most academically gifted player since @entity22
