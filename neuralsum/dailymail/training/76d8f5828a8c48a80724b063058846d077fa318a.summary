as the wedding vows say , they agree to build a life together ‘ for richer , for poorer ’			0
but just how rich or poor seems to be a secret among couples – with women the worse offenders for keeping their partners in the dark			2
a report reveals that one in ten people fail to tell their loved ones about all of their savings , while 63 per cent of couples ’ savings are kept in separate bank accounts			2
stash : one in ten people hide money from their partners - and women are the worst culprits , a survey found the average hidden stash is around £ 1,300 – an increase of 9 per cent since last year – meaning that @entity23 are furtively hoarding some £ 3billion all together			1
and , according to the research by @entity25 , one in eight women admitted concealing money from their partner , compared with one in ten men			1
the typical female had a stash of £ 1,400 , while men ’s hidden savings were around £ 1,100			1
men were also more likely to exaggerate their savings than women , with 5 per cent telling partners they had more put away than they did			2
the research also found that among those who shared a joint savings accounts , one in ten said their other half would not have to ask before dipping in – but the limit to take without permission was £ 286			2
@entity44 from @entity25 said : ‘ the number of couples keeping savings secret is on the rise with the @entity23 ’s hidden savings pot growing to just over £ 3billion			1
‘ however it is worth considering pooling funds between partners as combined savings could provide greater returns on interest			0
’ the survey of 2,000 adults also found a marked contrast in how different generations approached their banking			1
younger couples were more likely to have independent accounts , with 82 per cent of under - 25s saving separately – up from 80 per cent in 2013			1
this compares to just half of couples who are over 55			0
the @entity25 spokesman said they did not know why more people were keeping their savings separate – or even secret – as the economy started to improve			0
however @entity74 , from the @entity73 website , said many couples save independently to ensure they are both entitled to an @entity77 account – in which they can each put £ 15,000 a year			0
a separate report yesterday found savings among the over- 55s had risen by £ 10,000 in the last three years			0
