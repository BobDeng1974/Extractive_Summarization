if you think your @entity1 will be tiring spare a thought for the parents of @entity4 's biggest family - who started preparing for lunch at 1am			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , who have 16 children and another on the way , need a 10kg turkey , 7kg of potatoes and sprouts , 50 @entity14 puddings and litres of gravy to feed the 22 people expected today			1
the couple run a successful baking company , receive no state benefits and live in a ten - bedroom converted @entity21 care home			1
and thankfully the kitchen has two ovens so they can cook their mammoth @entity1 lunch			1
10kg turkey crown 50 @entity14 puddings 72 pigs in blankets 4kg of potatoes 70 mince pies 6 tins of @entity61 3kg of carrots , swede and @entity65 sprouts 30 rolls of wrapping paper cost : approximately £ 1,000 there are so many presents that the basement below their house is completely full and off - limits to the children , who get four each			1
this month they have already been to half a dozen nativities at least and their @entity1 costs them at least £ 1,000			1
mr and mrs @entity33 were childhood sweethearts and she got pregnant with their first child @entity78 , 25 , at the age of just 14			0
they proudly say ' no - one thought it would last ' but they are still happy after all these years			0
along with @entity78 , they are also parents to @entity84 , 19 , @entity85 , 17 , @entity86 , 15 , @entity87 , 14 , @entity88 , 13 , @entity89 , 12 , @entity90 , 11 , @entity91 , nine , @entity92 , eight , @entity93 , seven , @entity94 , six , @entity43 , four , @entity95 , three , and @entity96 , two			0
the couple also have two grandchildren and will have 22 guests for lunch this year			1
sadly mrs @entity33 lost baby @entity101 at 21 weeks in january but became pregnant again and her baby is due next year			0
despite the incredible number of guests everyone will get a seat - as long as they help with the cleaning up afterwards , which involves huge amounts of washing up including five dishwasher cycles			2
mrs @entity33 told @entity111 : ' @entity1 is exhausting , but i love it			1
' it 's such a magical time of year and it feels even more special with so many of us to celebrate			0
' full family : @entity96 , two , @entity95 , three , @entity43 , four , @entity94 , six , @entity93 , seven , @entity92 , eight , @entity91 , nine , @entity90 , 11 , @entity89 , 12 , @entity88 , 13 , @entity87 , 14 , @entity86 , 15 , @entity85 , 17 , @entity84 , 19 , @entity115 , 21 , and @entity78 , 25 , sandwiched by proud parents @entity6 and @entity7 @entity117 effort : each child will get four gifts each - but their parents use 80 metres of wrapping paper and spend two hours a night for a month getting them done siblings : @entity43 and @entity93 spend some time on the internet by the tree and will probably do the same on @entity1 excitement : mr and mrs @entity33 said that the children still believe in @entity1 so @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 will be very excited today the day starts with presents when the children get up at around 6.30am			1
breakfast follows where they usually need three loaves of bread , 12 eggs , two boxes of cereal and 18 pints of milk			0
after their 1pm lunch members of the family play separate games of @entity142 , watch films and play with their presents			1
this evening there will more food , including six tins of @entity61			0
@entity149 has become a military exercise			0
mrs @entity33 said : ' with such a big family , i ’ve become an expert at planning			0
it ’s not like me to leave anything to the last minute , so @entity1 preparation starts in september			1
online shopping for presents is handy , but i ’ll pick up things in town , too			2
' for christmas i have to keep a list – or i ’d go mad ! each of the kids gets one main gift and three smaller ones – that ’s 64 presents ! this year , @entity84 , 19 , has asked for driving lessons and @entity94 , six , wants a scooter			2
they all know there ’s a budget so they ’re not expecting a new xbox			0
' all the gifts need to be kept somewhere so @entity7 takes a few to work , while the rest are hidden in the basement			1
there are so many , i start wrapping when the kids are asleep , i spend about two hours each night			1
i get through at least 30 rolls of wrapping paper – it ’s the job i hate the most			1
' of course , none of this is cheap			0
our bakery business – which we bought before our fifth child @entity86 was born – supports our family , but i set aside a few pounds each week for @entity1			1
and i make use of the offers in shops '			0
mrs @entity33 says she wo n't be drinking because she is pregnant again - and admits she can barely remember a @entity1 when she was n't			1
and the couple - who feel ' incredibly lucky and blessed ' admit they believe this child will be their last			2
mrs @entity33 told @entity195 : ' we were n't planning on getting pregnant so quickly			0
i was n't sure it would happen , to be honest			0
' this will be the last , 18 is enough			0
i 've had bad morning sickness but it has stopped now so i am just waiting for the cravings '			2

9.30am : 10kg turkey crown is put in the oven and all the rest of the food is placed in trays and pots ready to be cooked 1pm : lunch is served thanks to two ovens with two sets of hobs			2
all 21 invited manage to get around the table - so no need for shifts			2
2pm : dishwasher is started and requires at least five cycles to get the through			2
other chores have to continue so some washing will be done using the family 's two washing machines and three tumble dryers 5pm : giant game of monopoly while the rest watch a film on tv and play with their new toys , or use the internet on their laptops			2
8pm : youngest children are bathed and ready for bed while the older children help with the cleaning up 11pm : exhausted - all the family are in bed asleep - and it all starts again tomorrow !			0

@entity6 and @entity7 , who have 16 children and another on the way , will be feeding 22 for @entity1 lunch
everybody will get a seat at their giant table but they must help wash up the dozens of plates and *cutlery* used
peeling of potatoes and vegetables started at 1am this morning and children were opening their gifts by 6.30am
couple started *buying* presents in september and spent two hours a day wrapping for a month to get job done
