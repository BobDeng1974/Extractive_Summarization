by @entity0 for @entity1 getting large equipment into space is no easy feat. at nearly £ 14,000 to send a kilogram into orbit , it 's expensive , and room is always limited			2
to deal with the problem , @entity9 has turned to the ancient art of origami , in the hopes of getting larger solar panels into space			1
these solar panels could someday be used in the form of an orbiting power plant that harvests energy from the sun and beams it back down to @entity20			1
the design , which looks like a flower blooming , was created by @entity9 mechanical engineer , @entity26 after two years of research , the space agency has come closer to that goal by creating a solar array with a diameter of 8.9ft ( 2.7 metres ) when folded and 82ft ( 25 metres ) when unfurled			1
the design , which looks like a flower blooming , was created by @entity9 mechanical engineer , @entity26			1
mr @entity26 partnered with researchers at @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , to pursue the idea that spacecraft could be built using origami folds			0
sending the solar arrays up to space would be easy , mr @entity26 said , because they could all be folded and packed into a single rocket launch , with ' no astronaut assembly required			1
' @entity45 , a student in mechanical engineering at @entity35 , unfolds a solar panel array that was designed using the principles of origami			2
these solar panels could someday be used in the form of an orbiting power plant that harvests energy from the sun and beams back down to @entity20 panels used in space missions already incorporate simple folds , collapsing like a fan or an accordion			1
one technique that has been used for an origami - inspired solar array is called a @entity64 fold invented by @entity65 astrophysicist @entity64			1
when you open the structure , it appears to be divided evenly into a checkerboard of parallelograms			0
with this particular fold , there 's only one way to open or close it : pull on one corner and the whole thing is open with only a tiny amount of effort			0
mr @entity64 intended this fold for solar arrays , and in 1995 a solar panel with this design was unfolded on the @entity82 , a @entity65 satellite			1
despite this test , the technology is still in its early stages			0
but now , with an emphasis on small satellites and large structures , mr @entity26 says arrays inspired by this fold could see renewed usefulness			1
solar power has had a difficult start on @entity20 thanks to inefficient panels and high costs			2
but in space , scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy			2
now , the space - based solar power – once merely the stuff of science - fiction – could be available sooner than expected if @entity65 has its way			2
within 25 years , the country plans to make space - based solar power a reality , according to a proposal from the @entity111 ( @entity111 )			1
the agency has outlined its plans to create a 1 - gigawatt commercial system for space - based solar power , which would provide about the same output as a nuclear power plant			1
in a recent @entity118 article by @entity119 , a professor emeritus at @entity111 , outlined the agency ’s plans create a 1.8 mile long ( 3 km ) man - made island in the harbour of @entity124			2
the island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity			0
the microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the @entity20			2
' the fact that we 're going both bigger and smaller may open up domains where it may be relevant again , ' mr @entity26 said			0
the fold that mr @entity26 and colleagues used is not a @entity64 fold , but rather a combination of different folds			0
mr @entity26 's prototype looks like a blooming flower that expands into a large flat circular surface			1
mr @entity26 envisions that foldable solar arrays could be used in conjunction with small satellites called cubesats			1
and he says the origami concept could be used in antennas as well			0
it could be especially appropriate for spacecraft applications where it 's beneficial to deploy an object from the centre , outward in all directions			0
@entity155 was originally intended for folding paper , which has almost no thickness , so mr @entity26 and colleagues had to be creative when working with the bulkier materials needed for solar panels			0
' you have to rethink a lot of that design in order to accommodate the thickness that starts to accumulate with each bend , ' he said			0
the art has been the subject of serious mathematical analysis only within the last 40 years , mr @entity26 said			0
there is growing interest in integrating the concepts of origami with modern technologies			0
' you think of it as ancient art , but people are still inventing new things , enabled by mathematical tools , ' he said			0
@entity26 ( pictured ) , a researcher at @entity9 's @entity179 in @entity180 , holds a prototype of a solar panel array that folds up in the style of origami			1
' you think of it as ancient art , but people are still inventing new things , enabled by mathematical tools , ' he said			0

prototype solar array has diameter of 8.9ft ( 2.7 metres ) when folded
but when unfurled , the solar array is around 82ft ( 25 metres ) wide
it looks like a blooming flower that expands into flat circular surface
@entity9 envisions that foldable solar arrays could be taken into space using small satellites , called cubesats , to create a huge orbiting power station
