a poster advertising @entity1 ’s perfume rogue has been banned in areas where children are likely to see it because it presents the pop star in a ' sexually suggestive ' way			1
the advert features an image of the @entity11 - born singer sitting on the floor with her head and shoulders leaning against a wall and her legs raised against a large bottle of perfume			2
the @entity19 said it imposed a placement restriction on the poster , which was produced on behalf of perfume company @entity22 , after a single complaint that it was offensively sexual , demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children to see			1
rather , they claim , @entity1 is depicted as being in a position of power , as indicated by the name @entity52 , which the company claims suggests ' one with the courage to challenge boundaries '			0
the @entity57 noted that the image showed @entity1 wearing clothes , and showed her looking directly at the viewer with an expression ' of defiance rather than vulnerability '			1
it said the overall impression of the singer was one of confidence , and concluded that the ad was ' unlikely to be demeaning to women or to cause serious or widespread offence '			0
controversy : the @entity19 said a single complaint was made saying @entity1 's advert was offensively sexual , demeaning to women and featured images not suitable for children @entity22 said @entity1 was known for her provocative songs and persona			1
on monday the singer left nothing to the imagination in a racy dress at the annual @entity84 however it noted that the advert was not given a placement restriction and had appeared in a number of places where it was likely to be seen by children			0
in a statement the @entity57 said : ' while we did not consider the image to be overtly sexual , we considered that @entity1 ’s pose , with her legs raised in the air , was provocative			2
' ' because of this , and the fact that @entity1 appeared to be naked except for high heels , we concluded that the ad was sexually suggestive and should have been given a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children			1
' it ruled that the ad must not appear again without a placement restriction to reduce the possibility of it being seen by children			0
not the first time : to promote her perfume ' @entity114 ' in june 2012 , this large poster showing a completely nude @entity1 was erected in @entity117 's @entity116 @entity119 ' , another perfume released in 2012 , featured an advert showing @entity1 wearing nothing but cream lace lingerie , a piece of gauze fabric draped strategically over her crotch it is not the first time an advert featuring @entity1 has caused controversy			1

she posted the image on her @entity140 account , accompanied by the caption : ' make sure you smell sexy , especially naked , this fall			0
' also in 2012 the cosmetic tycoon @entity143 - the head of @entity145 ’s parent firm @entity144 - complained that the brand had been tainted by the singer promoting its products			0
branding her ' too sexy ' , @entity143 said the singer should have been considered a ' no go ' for the brand ’s family image			0
@entity1 has also appeared in racy advertisements for @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity157 fashion range @entity156 ,			0

@entity19 said poster was *inappropriate* for children
features @entity1 wearing wearing only heels with legs resting on bottle
single complaint *prompted* the @entity19 to *investigate* the poster 's *suitability*
it ruled the advert was sexually provocative , but not demeaning to women
as such it can now only be *displayed* in areas where children wo *n't* see it
