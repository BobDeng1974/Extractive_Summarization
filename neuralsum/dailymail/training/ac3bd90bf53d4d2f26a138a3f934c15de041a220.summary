by @entity0 for @entity1 a beetle that appears the whitest shade of white to the human eye has been examined by scientists			1
researchers say that the scales on the @entity10 beetle can scatter light better than any other animal or plant			1
they believe its reflective coating could be copied to make brighter computer screens and paints as well as whiter paper			1
researchers say that the scales on the @entity21 ( pictured ) can scatter light better than any other animal or plant , making it an inspiration to scientists looking to develop new reflective materials the beetle has developed its extraordinary whiteness to blend in with the white mushrooms common in its native @entity31			1
another species called @entity34 has the same pigmentation			0
animals use a rainbow of colours for camouflage , communication , mating and to control their temperature			0
pigments in their skin absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others - giving them a colour			2
so to appear the whitest shade of white , the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally			1
to appear the whitest shade of white , the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally			1
they do this using a specially - adapted internal structure ( pictured ) to make a reflective coating the ultra-white @entity10 use the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule which is found everywhere from the shells of mussels to the structure of mushrooms – to reflect light			1
a magnified image of the @entity34 beetle , which has the same pigmentation , is pictured the @entity71 pit viper has ultra-black markings to help it blend into the forest floor			2
its black scales reflect less than 11 per cent of light , according to @entity78 , making it the ' blackest ' of creatures			1
the snake is also the heaviest viper with the largest venomous fangs			0
but scientists have engineered a material that is blacker than the snake			0
@entity88 firm @entity87 claims to have created the ' blackest ' material last month			0
@entity90 absorbs all but 0.04 per cent of light that hits it to give it its ultra-black appearance			0
the material is made from nanotubes that are 10,000 times thinner than a human hair			2
the tubes are packed so tightly together that entering light can not pass through them and gets ' lost ' inside them			0
the material could be used by the military and the space industry			0
the ultra-white @entity10 uses the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule that is found everywhere from shells to mushrooms – to do this			1
scientists at @entity112 have shown that the beetles have optimised their internal structure to produce maximum ‘ white ’ with minimal material and effort			1
scientists likened them to a painter who needs to whiten a wall with a very small quantity of paint			0
lead researcher dr @entity123 , of the @entity112 ’s @entity124 , said : ‘ current technology is not able to produce a coating as white as these beetles can in such a thin layer			1
‘ the lessons we are learning from these beetles is two-fold			0
‘ on one hand , we now know how to look to improve scattering strength of a given structure by varying its geometry			0
‘ on the other hand the use of strongly scattering materials , such as the particles commonly used for white paint , is not mandatory to achieve an ultra-white coating			2
’ co-author on the study , dr @entity143 , of the @entity144 in @entity145 , said : ‘ these scales have a structure that is truly complex since it gives rise to something that is more than the sum of its parts			0
’ in recent years , many engineers have been turning to nature to inspire ‘ new ’ types of structures			0
using technology perfected by the beetles , scientists hope to make paper , plastics and paints a brighter white			2
they also believe that white - light reflectors inside computer and tv displays could also be made whiter and lighter , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity170			2
the beetle ( pictured ) has developed its extraordinary whiteness to blend in with the white mushrooms common in its native @entity31 scientists at @entity112 have shown that the beetles have optimised their internal structure ( pictured ) in order to produce maximum ‘ white ’ with minimal material and effort			1

@entity112 scientists say scales on the @entity10 beetle can scatter light better than any other natural device
its scales reflect all wavelengths of light equally to appear ultra-white
beetle uses dense network of chitin molecules to scatter light
it produces white coating in a thinner layer than man - made techniques
beetle developed its white colouring to blend in with mushrooms in @entity31
reflective coating could be copied to produce brighter screens and paint
