@entity1 president @entity0 said the growing crisis in @entity3 threatens @entity1 but rejects the idea of sending troops to fight militant organizations ' wherever they pop up '			1
@entity0 said his administration would not fall into the trap of ' whack - a - mole ' foreign policy when a global , targeted response was needed to counter extremists			2
i think it 's important for us to recognize that @entity16 is just one of a number of organizations that we have to stay focused on , ' @entity0 told @entity21 ' @entity20			0
' this is going to be a global challenge and one that the @entity1 is going to have to address but we 're not going to be able to address it alone			0
' we 're going to have to have a more focused , more targeted strategy and we 're going to have to partner and train local law enforcement and military to do their jobs as well			0
' he said @entity29 militants that have seized @entity3 towns pose a ' medium - and long - term threat ' to the @entity1 because of their extreme ideology , but expects that the local populations would reject @entity16 because of their violence			1

the capture of @entity86 , situated on the @entity104 , and the nearby settlement of @entity87 , also raises the prospect that @entity16 militants are marching towards a dam at @entity109			1

@entity86 's mayor , @entity142 , said the militants ransacked the town 's government offices and forced local army and police forces to pull out			0
@entity86 and @entity87 had remained under government control since nearby @entity149 fell to the @entity29 militants in january			1

@entity1 secretary of state @entity52 has urged @entity54 nations not to fund groups behind @entity16 militants
