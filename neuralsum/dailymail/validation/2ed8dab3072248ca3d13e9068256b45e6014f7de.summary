@entity0 , 55 , won a long legal battle against being returned to @entity2 to serve four years in prison for attempted murder a man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in @entity9 – after judges refused to extradite him			1
@entity0 , 55 , has won a long legal battle against being returned to @entity2 to serve four years in prison for attempted murder , despite committing further crimes , including an assault , while living in @entity15			1
he earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee @entity2 because of @entity18 discrimination – and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting			1
last week ’s @entity23 ruling is a sharp reminder that while the @entity27 talks of ejecting foreign criminals , in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here			0
@entity0 , who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in @entity9 with his two sons in 1999 , made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away			1
in any case , his lawyers claimed , she died as a result of hanging herself , not because of the 14 bullets he ‘ accidentally ’ fired into her defenceless body			0
a @entity2 court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence , sentenced him to four years in prison , and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from @entity9			1
his lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds , arguing that he had a new @entity55 ‘ partner ’ in @entity9 – who actually lives a hundred miles away – and that he now had grandchildren in @entity15			1
and last week @entity9 judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving @entity59 the right to remain free here , after ruling it ‘ oppressive ’ to send him back to prison in @entity2 after so long			1
he was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife			0
speaking in broken @entity63 to the @entity64 last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable @entity67 in @entity15 , @entity0 said he had every right to remain in @entity9 , adding : ‘ @entity2 is dangerous – they still want me there			1
’ the case began in 1994 , amid the chaos of the @entity73 wars , when @entity0 , an ethnic @entity55 and former soldier in the @entity75 army , lived with his wife @entity76 and two sons in the village of @entity79			2
the area was declared part of a @entity55 republic but was also claimed by @entity2			2
@entity9 court documents note : ‘ after a quarrel with his wife @entity76 , she went out of the house , stood on a ladder , took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself			2
as she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious , the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body			0
‘ the cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant ’s gun			0
the defendant was charged with murder			0
’ the subsequent trial – by a @entity55 court – heard that @entity0 had fired 14 shots from his handgun ‘ causing a number of injuries ’			2
last week , @entity9 judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving @entity59 the right to remain free in the @entity9 , by ruling in the @entity23 ( pictured ) that it would be ‘ oppressive ’ to send him back to prison in @entity2 he told the court ‘ that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder , he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away , but did not know in which direction			1
’ after a single pathologist claimed mrs @entity126 had already died of strangulation before being shot , he was initially cleared of murder			0
in 1999 he then flew to @entity63 with his children and successfully claimed asylum , saying that his ethnic @entity55 children were discriminated against by @entity2 at school – but also complaining of ‘ local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife ’			2
while he began a life on benefits here , @entity2 ’s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial , with @entity0 ’s village now a part of @entity2 , and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder			1
four doctors said mrs @entity126 was still alive when her husband shot her			0
he was given a four - year prison sentence on the grounds that he ‘ had an intention to kill ’			0
@entity2 , a member of the @entity151 , some years later sought @entity0 ’s extradition , and in 2006 @entity9 police arrested him			1
a @entity9 court swiftly rejected the request , noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife			0
but in 2014 he was arrested again , and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the @entity23 in @entity15			0
last week ’s @entity23 judgment in @entity59 ’s favour , by judges @entity162 and mrs @entity163 , the conclusion of the long legal battle , noted : ‘ the offence for which the extradition of mr @entity0 is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one			2
moreover , mr @entity0 has not led a blameless life as a @entity9 citizen			2
‘ he has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013			0
nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite mr @entity0 by reason of the passage of time			0
’ the ruling was also sharply critical of the @entity2 legal system , and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago			0
and in reference to the @entity188 ’s ‘ right to a family life ’ clause , judges said @entity0 had ‘ been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006 , although they do not live together ’			1
far from living together , the @entity64 has discovered that ‘ partner ’ helping provide him with a ‘ family life ’ to maintain here is an ethnic @entity55 born in @entity9 and living 100 miles from him in @entity192 .			1

@entity0 , 55 , moved to @entity9 after being cleared of murdering his wife
he won asylum by claiming he fled country *due* to @entity18 discrimination
but @entity2 court convicted him in his absence during a retrial in 2000
@entity2 asked for his extradition from @entity9 in 2005 but lawyers fought move
they said he had right to family life with new @entity55 partner in the @entity9
@entity0 continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault
@entity23 has now ruled it ' oppressive ' to send @entity0 back after so long
