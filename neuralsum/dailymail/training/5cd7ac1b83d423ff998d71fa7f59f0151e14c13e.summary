by @entity0 @entity2 @entity1 on thursday rammed through a measure opening a new investigation of the deadly assault in @entity6 , @entity7 , vowing to dig deeper in a search for truth			1
@entity10 declared it merely a political ploy to raise campaign cash and motivate voters			0
a bitterly divided @entity2 voted 232 - 186 to establish the panel that speaker @entity16 insisted would answer questions that linger almost 20 months after the sept. 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity20 diplomatic mission			1
seven @entity10 , many facing tough re-election campaigns , broke ranks and joined @entity1 in supporting the probe			2
the panel 's investigation will be the eighth on @entity6 and will examine the entirety of the attack that killed @entity20 ambassador @entity29 and three other @entity20			1
independent , bipartisan and @entity1 - led probes have faulted the @entity31 for inadequate security at the outpost , leading to four demotions			1
no attacker has yet been brought to justice			0
speaker of the house @entity16 is asked about the special select committee he has formed to investigate the deadly 2012 attack on the @entity20 diplomatic post in @entity6 , @entity7 on thursday @entity1 say they 're unsatisfied with explanations so far , and they have leveled a range of accusations against president @entity44 , former secretary of state @entity45 and other senior administration officials			1
chief among them : that the administration misled the @entity20 people about the nature of the attack during a presidential election campaign and stonewalled congressional investigators			1
' we will not take any shortcuts to the truth , accountability or justice , ' @entity16 said during @entity2 debate			2
@entity10 remain divided over whether to boycott the select committee			2
they are concerned that their participation would grant legitimacy to what they believe will be a partisan forum			0
but they also worry that if they avoid it they wo n't have the chance to counter @entity1 claims and defend potential witnesses â€” including @entity74 , a possible 2016 presidential candidate			2
party leaders will meet with their rank and file friday morning to decide on the next step			2
rep. @entity79 , @entity80 , leaves a closed - door @entity1 strategy meeting at the @entity82 in @entity83 on wednesday			1
speaker of the house @entity16 has tapped @entity79 to chair a special select committee to investigate the attack on the @entity20 diplomatic outpost in @entity6 , @entity7 @entity89 rep. @entity89 of @entity90 criticized the ' song and dance ' she said came from @entity74 when @entity2 members wanted to question her about @entity6 a few months after the attack			1
@entity74 's testimony before the @entity96 was delayed when she missed a month of work toward the end of her tenure after suffering a virus , then a fall and a concussion , and then brief hospitalization for a blood clot near her brain			0
rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , said no evidence uncovered in any of the investigations thus far suggests wrongdoing by the administration			0
@entity1 claims have descended into ' the crass and unbelievable , ' she said			2
rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , said the questions ' have been asked and answered time and time and time again , ' and he added : ' let 's end the political circus			0
' @entity6 has produced 13 public hearings , the release of 25,000 pages of documents and 50 separate briefings			0
the select committee wo n't be the only inquiry , as other @entity1 - led congressional panels continue their probes , including a @entity129 investigation which just last week took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing a @entity132 member			1
secretary of state @entity133 has n't said when he might testify			0
@entity2 majority leader @entity134 , @entity135 , followed by rep. @entity136 , @entity137 , leaves a closed - door @entity1 strategy meeting in @entity83 on wednesday @entity10 deride the effort as a conservative campaign designed to energize @entity1 voters in typically low - turnout midterm elections			1
@entity16 's legislation creates a select @entity144 through the end of the year			0
it will have to be reapproved when a new @entity147 begins in january or go out of existence			0
the select committee has no explicit financial constraints			0
the @entity44 administration says officials tried to provide the public with the best information available after the attack at a time when @entity20 embassies , consulates and other facilities were facing angry demonstrations across the @entity162 world over a @entity164 video mocking @entity162 's @entity165			1
the administration originally attributed @entity6 to a similar protest that extremists hijacked , but retracted that account amid severe criticism			0
@entity2 @entity10 have issued several demands if they are to participate in the select committee			1
@entity16 already has rejected their call for equal representation on the panel , deciding instead to fill it with seven @entity1 and five @entity10			2
the democrats also seek guarantees they 'll have equal access to documents , say on subpoenas and right to question witnesses			0

@entity2 votes 232 - 186 *largely* along party lines to establish a select commitee to further investigate the sept. 11 , 2012 attack on the @entity20 mission in the @entity7 city
the investigation will be the eighth into the attack the killed @entity20 ambassador @entity29 and three other @entity20
@entity1 say they continue to be frustrated from a lack of answers from the @entity197 on the *incident*
