he said : ' i do n't like worrying my family , and i 've gotten dirty looks from locals who 've lost their homes and think storm chasers are insensitive			0
' but i love the buzz you get when you 're standing in sight of a tornado			0
' i appreciate it 's not everyone 's idea of fun and most of my family and friends think it 's mad but i love watching the full force of @entity61			0
' it 's the best show on earth			0
' when people find out what i do for fun they usually think i 'm mad			0
' but when they see the photographs i 've taken , they all say it 's amazing and they want to try it ! ' this stunning photo of a super storm cell forming on the horizon was captured by @entity8 in @entity23 in june this year @entity8 escaped death by minutes when one of the largest tornadoes recorded hit @entity38 in 2013 - but he did capture this image in the past four years , @entity8 has visited @entity28 ( pictured here ) , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 to chase storms as a child @entity8 , from @entity83 , was fascinated by thunderstorms and spent hours staring at the sky as they happened			1
his fascination with extreme weather continued and his passion grew as he watched more and more documentaries about storms			0
in 2010 the consultant engineer went on his first ever storm chasing holiday to @entity28 with @entity94 , and he has not looked back since			2
now , every summer the dad - of - one shuns a traditional family beach holiday and leaves behind his quiet suburban life to set foot in @entity7 's @entity12 chasing the deadly storms			1
he has been on more than 20 chasing tours and has seen 26 tornadoes across the @entity102			2
he has also watched supercells - a thunderstorm characterised by the presence of a deep , persistently rotating updraft - lightning storms and dust clouds			2
@entity8 and @entity108 ' smashed windscreen which was broken during a tornado - chasing trip in @entity28 earlier this year this photo of mammatus clouds was captured by @entity8 during a storm - chasing trip in @entity23 in june 2014 luckily @entity8 has escaped injury over the past four years but he said there have been a few close calls			1
on his most recent tour in may this year @entity8 's van was bombarded with baseball - sized hail stones came close to smashing the reinforced windscreen to pieces			1
' it was like being in a war zone			0
we could n't even drive away because the other windows are n't toughened glass so they would n't have protected us , ' @entity8 said			2
' we just had to wait for it to stop and hope the windows lasted or someone could have been killed			0
' on another tour in @entity32 , the group were watching @entity134 videos in the car before noticing a tornado was forming right in front of them			2
he added : ' we were caught completely off guard but thankfully no one was hurt and we were perfectly positioned to watch it develop from start to finish			0
' the hobby has cost @entity8 ( right ) £ 10,000 and means that wife @entity14 ( left ) is left alone to look after their 20 - month - old daughter @entity8 and @entity108 pictured in @entity148 in 2013			1
the daring couple have traveled all over mid-west @entity7 chasing tornadoes but @entity8 's most dangerous trip was to @entity38 in may 2013 , where he escaped death by minutes after one of the largest tornadoes the country has ever seen hit			1
the two and a half mile - wide twister raged through @entity158 and the surrounding suburbs for forty - five minutes			2
@entity8 said : ' it was terrifying			2
thousands were left without homes and twenty - four people were killed , including three storm chasers			2
' i realised then that there was a whole other side to chasing that i had n't really expected			0
' we were staying in a hotel with a lot of people who had lost their homes and it was humbling to talk to them about how the storm had affected their lives , but we also got a lot of dirty looks for being storm chasers			0
' people think they 're insensitive but storm chasers collect a lot of important meteorological data and they 're often the first ones to report dangerous weather systems to the authorities so they actually save lives as well			0
' @entity8 is a consultant engineer but the married father - of - one spends his holidays chasing storms like this one in @entity23 @entity8 eventually hopes @entity14 will join him on one of his trips when their daughter is older			1
@entity14 , who goes on her own annual fitness holidays to @entity193 , said : ' we 're both very independent people			0
' i know @entity8 's always been interested in weather and he loves photography so it made sense to combine the two			0
' i would never stop him from going because i know how much he loves it			0
' @entity8 's storm - chasing hobby is dangerous but it has allowed his to capture stunning images like this one taken this summer another image of storm clouds taken by @entity8 on a tornado - chasing trip to @entity23 over the summer months of 2014			1
