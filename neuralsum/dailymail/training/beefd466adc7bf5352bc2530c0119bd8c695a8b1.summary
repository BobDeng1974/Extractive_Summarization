@entity4 said : ' i heard one of my friends whisper " do n't worry about the leftovers - @entity4 will hoover them up "			1
' i was mortified - i nearly broke down in tears there and then			2
' i knew i was big but did n't realise what other people thought of me - especially what i considered to be a friend			0

swapped junk food for healthy meals and discovered love of running
dropped more than five stone in eight months , reaching a slim 10st 9lb
