cocktail lovers rejoice ! @entity2 researchers have developed what could be the ultimate ingredient for the piña colada of the future			1
in what is thought to be a world first , they have developed a new breed of pineapple that is not only sweet and juicy but which has the added tropical taste of coconut			2
@entity2 's @entity13 today announced it is in the final stages of developing the new variety			1
the pina colada pineapple : researchers with the @entity2 @entity13 believe they are the first in the world to develop a coconut - flavoured pineapple - which could revolutionise cocktail making the agency 's research station in in @entity24 has been working on the new breed , to be known as the @entity27 pineapple , for more than a decade			1
' taste tests tell us that @entity27 is a winner - it has this lovely coconut flavour , which you wo n't find in any other pineapple in @entity2 , ' horticulturalist @entity34 told the @entity2 @entity36			1
the piña colada was first served on august 15 , 1954 , at the @entity39 ’s @entity38 in @entity40 , @entity41 by head barman @entity42			0
according to legend , @entity44 's managers had asked him to mix a new signature drink for the bar that would delight the demanding palates of its star - studded clientele			2
@entity44 accepted the challenge , and after three intense months of blending , shaking and experimenting , the first piña colada was born			0
he made the drink using local @entity54 rum mixed with @entity56 coconut cream , which was invented the same year at the @entity57			1
these days the @entity58 defines the piña colada as a @entity60 and stipulates that it must contain one part white rum , one part cream of coconut , and three parts pineapple juice			1

the @entity27 would do away with any need for coconut at all			0
mr @entity34 said the researchers did not initially intend to create a pineapple that tasted like coconut			0
' when we 're doing the breeding , we 're not actually looking for a coconut - flavoured pineapple or any other particular flavour , ' he told @entity99			2
' we 're looking for a nice flavoured pineapple			0
we 're looking for a variety that is sweet , low acid and aromatic			0
' the @entity13 confirmed the development but said anyone hoping for a ' pina colada ' pineapple will have to wait			1
