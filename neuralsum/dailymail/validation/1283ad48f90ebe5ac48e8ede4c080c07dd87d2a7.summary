@entity1 's top football clubs , all out of the @entity2 before the quarter - finals , are concerned their chances of signing the next generation of stars are being hampered by the @entity8 ’s new regulations governing agents			1
the rules , which come into force next month after @entity12 passed the buck on managing the middle men to national associations , include a ban on agents earning money for representing players under 18 years old			1
as a result , clubs fear there will no longer be a level playing field in the global hunt for young talent because the players ’ representatives will want them to sign for teams in countries where the agents ’ code is far more relaxed			1
@entity31 vents his frustration on the sideline as @entity35 crash out of the @entity2 @entity36 ( second left ) was at his mesmerising best as @entity37 beat @entity38 on wednesday and @entity40 clubs , who will abide by the rules , have further worries on how these restrictions will be policed by the @entity8 , with agents no longer needing a licence to operate			1
the competitive market in signing teenage prospects is shown by the @entity50 juniors who have just reached their fourth consecutive @entity52 final			1
among the class of 2015 are @entity54 , plucked from @entity55 at 13 , while @entity58 , on the fringe of the first team , arrived from @entity59 at 16			2
@entity58 is on the fringe of the @entity50 first team having arrived from @entity59 aged 16 @entity63 ’s rugby coverage has been recognised for its class by most of its pundits , presenters and commentators being plundered for the @entity68			2
@entity69 are taking on loan @entity70 , @entity72 ( right ) , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 while @entity78 have made temporary signings in @entity80 and @entity81			2
after the fallout from @entity1 players ’ bad behaviour on a @entity87 promotional day during the @entity88 in @entity89 , it makes sense that none of the @entity1 backers have been given sponsorship days with the squad during the 2015 tournament			1
however , the @entity96 claim the team have behaved ‘ impeccably ’ on sponsorship duty since @entity99 took charge in 2012			2
the @entity96 claim @entity1 have behaved ‘ impeccably ’ on sponsorship duty since @entity99 took charge @entity103 spent £ 46,272 on a survey by research company @entity105 ‘ reassuring ’ the organisation their no - compromise approach to funding only @entity109 medal contenders is overwhelmingly the right one			2
as predicted , the only real change is that participation numbers will now be taken into consideration in judging sports with equal medal chances			0
so basketball , whose loss of backing from @entity103 led to enough criticism of the no - compromise strategy for the survey to be commissioned , will continue to rely on special case hand - outs from @entity1 to afford to participate in elite competition			0
at a time when the @entity126 need to get their pr act together , head of selectors @entity124 chose not to front a print - media briefing when announcing the @entity132 squad for the @entity133			0
this meant when @entity124 , a hapless public performer , got in an embarrassing tangle with @entity78 ’s @entity136 over @entity137 and his possible @entity1 return , he did not have the press conference to redress the mixed messages coming out of the @entity126 over what @entity137 has been promised — which is nothing			0
@entity137 's possible @entity1 return got @entity124 in a flap with @entity78 's @entity136 swimming have been remarkably positive about @entity1 taking a whopping £ 667,895 from their grass - roots monies after a steep decline in participation			1
in fact @entity150 ceo @entity149 even welcomed ‘ @entity1 ’s continued investment ’			0
the sport realises the cuts could have been more drastic and the lost cash will at least stay in the sport as swimming pool operators , working with @entity150 , have been charged with making venues more customer - friendly			0
@entity12 president @entity160 has not only turned down the opportunity to take part in a live tv debate with his three rivals , but also the opportunity to speak as a candidate at the @entity167 in @entity168 next week			0
instead @entity160 only wants the microphone to address @entity167 as @entity12 president			0
meanwhile , there have been a flurry of national association football chiefs from around the globe coming into @entity175 for audiences with @entity160 , which @entity12 somehow claim is ‘ business as usual ’ rather than electioneering			1
@entity12 president @entity160 turned down the opportunity to take part in a live tv debate with his three rivals			0
