it is almost seven months since @entity1 took over at @entity2 and you would have to say that they are still not where they would have hoped to be in terms of team development			1
they may be satisfied with their position in the table — they can return to third place if they beat @entity16 — and it ’s difficult to argue with a run that has produced one defeat in 16 games			1
but there is still something that does n’t quite gel about this @entity2 team			2
@entity24 has been asked to play in midfield in order to accommodate the likes of @entity27 @entity28 has been playing at the tip of the diamond in recent weeks with @entity24 playing in a deeper role @entity32 has been given the chance to prove his worth by partnering @entity35 in attack @entity24 's @entity38 heat map against @entity39 showed he barely featured in attack , with much more time spent either out wide right or in his own half the back - three line - up looks as though it will be dispensed with for now			1
although there have been injuries which have hampered @entity49 ’s ability to play that system , there simply are not enough players who have adapted to it			1
they really look more comfortable in a back four at this point			2
earlier in the season it was the defence which had proved the big problem , but in that 16 - game unbeaten run they have conceded just seven goals			2
it is not an assured back line just yet but it is a long way from the chaos of the 5 - 3 defeat by @entity67 in september			2
in attack , though , i only see glimpses of a team who are really clicking and usually that is only at @entity74			1
@entity49 has now had long enough with them that offensively they should look comfortable , especially with the array of talent he has at his disposal			2
the individuals themselves can look impressive at times — @entity35 , @entity27 or @entity24 — but , especially away from home , it still looks as though they are sorting out how to play			1
and it ’s a long way into the season to be still sorting this out			2
at the heart of that is the problem of where to play @entity24			1
@entity49 wants to play two up top and the versatility of @entity24 means that he is the one to drop in to midfield , with @entity94 and @entity32 as the strikers			1
i do n’t have a problem with @entity24 in midfield			1
in fact , i think it can suit him and become his best position in the later stages of his career			1
but which part of the midfield do you play him ? former @entity108 star @entity28 has been given a free licence to roam around behind the main strikers @entity1 is struggling to find a way of getting the best out of his attacking players @entity32 and @entity24 , pictured travelling to @entity114 , are expected to be involved against @entity16 if he is one of the attacking players in a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , with at least one midfielder holding a defensive role , then i think he can thrive in that position			1
he has the licence to break into the box from the deeper positions and face the play , rather than have his back to goal			1
i think that could work to his advantage			2
he also has the vision to play great passes and pick out his team - mates from midfield , so i understand why @entity49 wants him there			1
i can even see him at the tip of a diamond in midfield , but that seems to be the role for @entity28			1
what does not work is when he is playing in a diamond as one of the central midfielders behind @entity28			1
that is not his role			2
there ’s too much tracking back to be done in that position and he will end up in very deep positions			1
you want @entity24 to be the hub of the team , breaking into the box			1
also , in that position , you have to pull wide at times to give the team tactical stability			1
that again takes him away from the action			2
@entity24 played on the right of a midfield diamond against @entity159 on tuesday the @entity2 captain , pictured scoring against @entity16 in march 2014 , has not scored since @entity162 i can see that the diamond formation might seem the most natural way for @entity49 to go at the moment but it wo n’t get the best out of @entity24 — and if you do n’t get the best out of @entity24 then it ’s difficult to see that it will be best for @entity2			1
it is important they do work out a style which does flow in these final months of the season			2
if they qualify for the @entity177 then i ’m sure most people at the club would say that was a job well done for this campaign			2
next season , of course , the expectation will be much higher			2
but they do need that top - four spot to ensure they can keep recruiting the best players next season			1
and that is not at all certain			0
@entity190 are coming on a good run ; @entity192 have @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 coming back ; @entity196 already have @entity198 back , which should make an enormous difference			0
plus , my old club @entity200 are so well set up that they will cause all those teams more worries before the season is over			0
i said at the start of the campaign that @entity2 would not finish in the top four unless they got their defenders back			0
it ’s still looking like it will be a close - run contest and , with a couple of their rivals in the ascendancy , @entity2 can not afford to look like a team in transition			0
the @entity215 will be hoping to secure a spot in next season 's @entity177 during the next few months it was sad to leave @entity219 this week but once @entity220 had decided that he could n’t go on , it felt like the right thing to leave at the same time			1
@entity220 brought me in there to do a specific job and , once he had gone , there seemed no point in staying			0
it was a surprise how quickly it all turned out			0
@entity220 has been in pain for some time with his knees and the news that he needed an operation was a real blow to him			0
last time that happened he was on crutches for 12 weeks			1
that said , we were in and out of the relegation zone and i reckon if @entity220 had been able to stay , we would have climbed out of the bottom three once again			0
@entity237 decided to leave @entity219 following @entity220 's resignation from the west @entity114 outfit everyone on the coaching staff was aware that we needed better results			1
but equally it looked as though fortunes were going to ebb and flow throughout the season among the teams towards the bottom			0
each week another team or manager seems to be under pressure			0
we were confident we could make sure it was n’t us by the end of the season			0
i ’ve heard all the theories as to why he left but i do n’t believe it was related to the january transfer window			0
the club tried to bring in the right players but , as deadline day approached , it simply became harder and harder			0
@entity237 enjoyed his time at @entity219 but it was only right to leave the club following @entity220 's departure i have enjoyed the past six months , however			1
i ’ve never been in a pure coaching role before and , though i was apprehensive when i went into it , i discovered that i really enjoyed it			0
clearly as manager there has to be a degree of distance between you and the team			0
you ’re always the man who has dropped half of the squad , so it ’s impossible to be too close			0
but that was n’t the case as a coach and i found i liked being that much closer to the players			0
i also enjoyed coaching the @entity282 at times			0
there are a good crop of players coming through at @entity219 from there			0
my hope for the club is that they do now stay up under a new manager			0
there were some good people at the club and i enjoyed my time there			0
as for the future , i have some business interests and i enjoy writing this column and of course i have my punditry with @entity298 and @entity299			0
some offers have come in but for now i ’ll take stock and work out what is best for me and my family .			0
