by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 29 march 2013 a former chief constable who was criticised for his actions during the @entity4 disaster will keep his estimated £ 1m pension			0
sir @entity6 also faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood yesterday after he was heavily criticised over his reaction to a watchdog report on the @entity4 disaster			1
the @entity11 said he would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct had he still been a serving officer			2
but , because he resigned from his £ 225,000 a year job as head of @entity17 last october , it is powerless to take disciplinary action against him			1
@entity20 , of the @entity19 , said sir @entity6 should be stripped of his knighthood , police pension and other accolades mrs @entity20 's son , @entity25 , was among the 96 football fans killed in the crush at @entity4 victims ’ families described sir @entity6 , 57 , who denies any wrongdoing , as an ‘ absolute disgrace ’ and renewed their calls for him to lose his knighthood and lucrative police pension			1
the row centres on sir @entity6 ’s alleged dealings with his police authority following the publication of a damning report on @entity4 last year			1
the @entity11 said the chief constable attempted to influence public perception as the @entity42 was deciding whether to refer him to the watchdog over the findings of the @entity47 report			2
it said : ‘ while it was evident sir @entity6 made no attempt to prevent the referral happening , the @entity11 investigation concluded that he attempted to manipulate the public perception of the referral process for his own self - interest			1
’ the watchdog added it had concluded sir @entity6 ‘ had a case to answer for discreditable conduct and abuse of authority , breaches which , if proven in a disciplinary hearing , would amount to gross misconduct as they would justify dismissal			1
however , as sir @entity6 left the police service in october 2012 he can not face a disciplinary hearing in which the evidence could be tested			1
instead , the @entity11 is publishing its findings for the public to judge ’			2
complaints were sent to the @entity11 about his involvement in the aftermath of the @entity4 disaster sir @entity6 was a chief inspector with @entity71 at the time of the disaster and was at the match as a spectator on the day @entity11 deputy chair @entity75 said the aftermath of @entity4 had become synonymous with police attempts to cover up the truth , manipulate messages and defect blame @entity20 , of the @entity19 , said sir @entity6 should be punished over his conduct			1
she said : ‘ the man is an absolute disgrace			0
in the @entity11 ’s own words , this was gross misconduct and , in my mind , that is a very serious offence and the fact that he resigned should not mean that this report is the end of it			2
we want to see him stripped of his honours – his knighthood and his @entity95 from @entity97 @entity96			0
i believe he resigned to protect his pension			0
’ mrs @entity20 , who lost her 18 - year - old son , @entity25 , in the disaster , said the @entity11 report was ‘ another step on the road to justice ’ for the 96 victims of the @entity4 tragedy			2
@entity107 , of the @entity108 , added : ‘ it is frustrating to know that serious allegations can be levelled at this man yet no action can be taken			0
’ sir @entity6 is the latest in a string of chief constables to leave their jobs under a cloud yet keep their full pension			1
he was a chief inspector with @entity71 at the time of the disaster in 1989			0
he attended the @entity121 semi-final involving @entity97 and @entity122 at @entity124 ’s @entity4 ground as a spectator			0
sir @entity6 ( pictured in 2008 ) today questioned the ' fairness ' of the @entity11 report after the tragedy , he was involved in the resulting force investigation			1
his involvement in that inquiry has provoked waves of allegations and criticism from the families of those who died and has dogged his career , which included a stint as the chief constable of @entity139			0
he quit as @entity141 chief in october , saying the controversy had become a ‘ distraction to policing ’			0
he is said to be entitled to an annual pension of more than £ 83,000			0
pictured during the 25th anniversary memorials , fans hold up placards that spell out ' @entity149 ' during a match between @entity97 and @entity151			0

former head of @entity17 ' would have faced dismissal '
sir @entity6 questioned the ' fairness ' of the @entity11 's process
left police force in october last year so can not face disciplinary action
