mother of collaboration : lady @entity2 invented collaborations with her 1916 collection for @entity5 @entity6 sparked a retail frenzy this past weekend with his ode to cheap clothes at @entity10			1
but while the collection may have disappeared from store shelves , the concept of design collaborations has deeper roots than fast fashion may imply			0
the institution was actually started in @entity18 in 1916 by @entity20 survivor @entity19 , whose couture house @entity22 changed the landscape of fashion for the modern era			1
while little - known outside of fashion historian circles , @entity22 ’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety			1
the house of @entity22 , revered for its feminine @entity31 glamour , defined the era ’s aesthetic with clothes that overflowed with frills , florals , and sweet colors			1
it was the go - to label for @entity40 aristocracy , as well as gentries in the @entity42 and @entity43			2
but @entity22 was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes			2
it was a game - changer in the realms of fashion business practices , as well as marketing			0
@entity22 ( who often went by @entity22 , professionally ) created the first - ever designer collaboration with a two - season run for @entity5 she was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows , release a branded perfume , and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques			1
@entity22 was founded in 1893 according to @entity61 , author of the self - published book @entity63 , as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage			2
@entity22 built @entity22 ’s name on attention - grabbing antics			1
she was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition			0
@entity22 ’s sister , the novelist and film producer @entity75 , offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the @entity80 , whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady - type figures			1
haute couture : @entity22 's designs epitomized the @entity89 era 's hyper feminine aesthetic and overflowed with frills , florals , and sweet colors @entity22 ’s many publicity stunts earned her label a certain sense of notoriety — one which was tempered by her lofty social title , which she earned in her second marriage to @entity101 landowner and @entity103 fencer sir @entity102			1
‘ how she presented herself went a long way in the business , the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive , ’ said @entity104 , a fashion history professor at @entity105 , @entity106			0
it also paved her foray into the lingerie industry — a move that is well marked with cultural transgressions			0
while @entity22 did not reinvent lingerie garments , she did revolutionize underpinnings by ushering the then - utilitarian objects into the decorative arena			1
her undergarments were sold out of a boudoir in her atelier named @entity122 , an environment where women were meant to feel comfortable shopping for lingerie with risqué style names like ' @entity127 '			0
she also named her ready - to - wear designs with monikers like ‘ @entity130 ’ and ‘ @entity131 ’			0
famous fans : @entity22 often created custom designs for performers , including famous members of the @entity80 , making it the first label to capitalize on celebrity culture ‘ she allowed respectable women to shop for lingerie — if @entity22 is saying it ’s ok to buy it , then it ’s ok , ’ @entity104 continued			1
says april @entity144 , a research associate in @entity146 ’s special collection archives , ‘ in some ways she reminds me of [ @entity149 designer ] @entity150 , because she has done that collaboration with @entity152 and is infamous for pulling publicity tricks			2
’ ' @entity22 definitely had a keen mind for publicizing herself			2
she was really interested in promoting her brand through the force of her own personality ' @entity22 even reportedly used mirrored runways in her shows , allowing front - row patrons an especially premium view — up the models ’ skirts			2
‘ quite similarly [ to @entity150 ] @entity22 definitely had a keen mind for publicizing herself , she was really interested in promoting her brand through the force of her own personality , ’ @entity144 added			0
@entity22 ’s influence hit its peak in the @entity89 era , a time when ruffled extravagance was de rigeuer among the world ’s wealthy			1
but when the @entity175 hit , a need for simplified elegance suddenly arose			0
catwalk ready : @entity22 was one of the first brands to stage runway shows for its clients , as shown in this photo where models present themselves in the brand 's newest designs tasked with maintaining her relevance , @entity22 decided to expand her potential reach to the everyday person			1
in 1916 , two years after the war began , @entity22 teamed up with then mail order - only business @entity5 on a small co-opted collection			1
the designs -- which included daywear , special occasion items , outerwear , and even suits -- were ‘ very close to her couture aesthetic , super feminine with lots of ribbons , lots of layers , lots of lace , and sumptuous material like velvets , chiffon , and silks , ’ said @entity144			0
with inflation , the garments ( priced from $ 25 to $ 40 ) , would cost between $ 500 and $ 900 , which @entity144 says is ‘ very comparable to the cost of high - end ready - to - wear today			1
’ the designs , which were still custom - tailored ( customers had to fill out forms with their full - body measurements ) , were remarkably less expensive than @entity22 ’s couture pieces that , with inflation , would run in the ballpark of $ 5,000			2
self - promotion : @entity22 was a trailblazer for fashion marketing , as seen in this early advertisement which promotes one of her standalone stores influential : @entity22 's couture , seen in an advertisement ( left ) and on a model ( right ) was favored by aristocratic women who enjoyed her plush outlook on feminine attire the collaboration lasted two seasons			1
there is very little documentation that charts its financial success			0
@entity104 says that the collection likely received ‘ an even stronger reaction to the one we had in this age to @entity239 for @entity240			0
’ ' maybe she did lose a few high - end customers			1
the @entity243 person was n’t reading @entity5 - that was for the staff ' elaborating , she said : ‘ maybe she did lose a few high - end customers			1
the @entity243 person was n’t reading @entity5 , that was for the staff			0
’ while @entity22 ’s attempt at widening her audience likely worked , her label ultimately did not manage to adapt itself to the vast cultural changes of the early 20th century			2
‘ once you have @entity254 and @entity255 on the scene you just have a different idea about what fashion could be , ’ @entity104 said			0
‘ @entity22 is not about simplicity and i really stress that the @entity175 started modernity , it ’s simpler			2
’ reinvented : @entity22 's great - great - great granddaughter @entity262 has restarted the brand , using its feminine archives as inspiration the new @entity22 look : the designs , which are handmade in @entity269 , retail between $ 140 and $ 400 @entity22 continued to design into the @entity270 , but ‘ she did n’t groom a successor , at that time once a designer would pass away the whole business would close			1
those who had diversified later on , like @entity254 , made sure there was someone to take over the business , ’ @entity104 added			0
the house of @entity22 entirely dissolved by 1933 , and lay dormant until 2005 when her great - great granddaughter decided to reinvigorate the house for the modern era			1
@entity262 , 43 , now oversees the house of @entity22 , which operates as a lingerie - only label			1
she grew up playing dress up in the label ’s archive of relics , ‘ cutting them up and remaking them for our dolls and our dogs , ’ she told @entity294			0
along with two other employees , @entity262 has re-established @entity22 , pulling inspiration from her great great great grandmother ’s original designs and sketchbooks			1
‘ the fashion has changed but the color ways and the essence has not , ’ she said of the new @entity22			0
while @entity303 would not release sales figures , she stressed that the label has found success in specialty boutiques			0
the designs , which are hand cut and hand sewn in @entity269 , retail between $ 140 and $ 400			0
fashion frenzy : @entity10 's recent collaboration with 3.1 @entity6 sparked a retail storm and racks in store were cleared by eager customers nationwide ca n't get enough : @entity240 's designer collections have been equally popular , with young fashionistas grabbing armfuls of designs from last year 's @entity313 at a @entity18 store ‘ i think the ultimate goal is to have boutiques in @entity18 , @entity327 , @entity328 , and @entity329 and to reinstate the brand as it was 100 years ago , ’ @entity262 said of her aspirations for the label			1
in the meantime , fashion historians are eager to bring @entity22 ’s original legacy into the public spotlight			2
in the last decade her work has been commemorated with retrospectives at the @entity337 as well as the museum at @entity146			0
‘ i think when historians look back on today , one of the hallmarks of this period will be all of the high - low collaborations , ’ said @entity104			2
‘ when they look for the precedent and see that it is @entity22 , i think that is what she will be remembered for			0
’ says @entity144 , ‘ she deserves a more thorough investigation for her contributions , she was a line - crosser and there are definitely people who would be interested in her story			0

lady @entity2 's high - end label @entity22 created two collections for @entity5
the designer also staged one of the world ’s first runway shows and released a branded perfume
@entity22 's great , great , great granddaughter , @entity262 , 43 , has now *relaunched* the house of @entity22 as a lingerie label
