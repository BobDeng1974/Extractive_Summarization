amateur oceanographers or curious travellers no longer have to leave the comforts of home to reach the depths of the ocean floor			2
researchers are creating a @entity8 ‘ street view ’ of the world ’s coral reefs and other underwater scenes with 360 - degree photos that reveal the marvels of marine life in stunning detail			2
the captivating panoramas show the wonders of the ocean like they have never been seen before			1
one of the most fascinating images captured by the crew ’s 360 - degree cameras shows @entity46 , a bronze sculpture covered in corals , at the bottom of the @entity50			2
the haunting statue was deliberately dropped in the water in 1965 , and it depicts @entity27 with his arms raised toward the ocean 's surface			0
back to school : scientists are learning how to use an underwater camera to map the @entity50 @entity46 , a bronze sculpture covered in corals , was deliberately placed on the sea floor in 1965 the sanctuary surrounding the archipelago at the southern tip of @entity50 offers world - class diving , swimming , snorkelling and fishing for visitors , but not everyone can afford to go there			1
@entity50 is the world ’s third largest barrier reef with more than 6,000 species of marine life and shipwrecks			0
the online gallery , described as scuba diving from your computer , gives people a glimpse of what they ’re missing			0
@entity83 , chief of the conservation science division with @entity39 ’s @entity38 , said : ‘ this allows people who ca n't get underwater to understand what we mean by putting up a special preservation area around this particular spot			0
’ the team ’s basketball - shaped cameras are tethered to scuba divers and powered by small motors			0
@entity96 is teaching @entity31 scientists to use a panoramic camera that will allow them to map and record reefs in the country ’s protected areas , document any changes to the vulnerable ecosystem and educate the public about conservation efforts			1
new depths : @entity21 has already mapped portions of @entity109 ’s @entity108 and underwater mountains off @entity111 in @entity112 by mapping reefs , scientists will be able to document any changes to the vulnerable ecosystems and educate the public about conservation efforts @entity96 started its underwater survey in 2012 , snapping more than 400,000 photos			1
it has already shared incredible scenes from @entity109 ’s @entity108 , colourful ecosystems in @entity125 and @entity126 and underwater sea mountains off the @entity111 in @entity112			1
thanks to the group ’s efforts , travel buffs can now browse a collection of high - resolution images on @entity134 and other websites			1
the mapping is taking place as the world ’s reefs are in a dramatic state of decline			0
@entity96 says over 40 per cent of the world ’s corals have been destroyed over the last 30 years due to pollution , destructive fishing and climate change			0
if the decline continues , it will pose a major threat to 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for food , tourism income and coastal protection			0
@entity21 and the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) are mapping coral reefs in the @entity31 for the first time			1

panoramas show ocean wonders like they have never been seen before
scientists are mapping a @entity31 marine sanctuary for the first time
@entity134 already has images of @entity108 , @entity111
