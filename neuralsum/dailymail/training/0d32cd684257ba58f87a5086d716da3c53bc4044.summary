but he says mr @entity1 had a fight with his brother , the then 49 - year - old @entity18 , in november 2011 over their father ’s inheritance			1
‘ he pinned me down , ’ said mr @entity1			0
‘ i was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down			0
’ on september 5 , 2012 , @entity28 was blasted to death along with his wife @entity30 , 47 , his mother - in - law @entity31 , 74 , and @entity32 , a 45 - year - old @entity6 cyclist			1
now mr @entity1 , who comes from an @entity35 - @entity34 background , is on police bail following his arrest on suspicion of planning the murders – claims he also vehemently denies			1
instead he told the @entity39 that he believes mr @entity32 was the real target of the gunman and that the @entity6 police were concentrating on the @entity43 out of bigotry towards foreigners			1
‘ i have told the police from the beginning that i am an open book			2
i have nothing to hide , ’ said mr @entity1 , who was arrested in june			0
@entity51 , the @entity6 prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry , pushed for mr @entity1 ’s arrest but has since admitted that the case against him ‘ would not last 20 minutes ’ in a court of law			1
mr @entity1 , a payroll manager who lives in @entity58 , @entity9 , said he was in @entity59 , @entity60 , on the day of the murder , and his alibi has been confirmed			0

’ mr @entity1 said a feud over a £ 1millon house in @entity86 , @entity9 , was the only problem in an otherwise ‘ smooth ’ relationship between the brothers			0
the @entity6 claim that one of the reasons mr @entity1 was arrested was because of a series of mysterious phone calls to @entity95 when he could have been ‘ hiring ’ a hitman			2
but mr @entity1 said this was absolute fiction , saying : ‘ i have no idea where @entity95 came from ; i ’ve never even been asked about @entity95			0
’ mr @entity1 said he would be prepared to take a lie detector and was on ‘ a mission to find out the truth			0
’ he thinks the possibility of mr @entity32 being the target has been played down because of the influence of the ‘ rich , powerful local family ’ of @entity32 ’s girlfriend , the pharmacy heiress @entity106			2
mr @entity32 had just started three years paternity leave from the nuclear components factory where he worked , and was relying on the now extremely rich ms @entity106 to support him			2
road : mr @entity32 and the @entity112 were killed by an unknown assassin near @entity7 investigation : police outside mr @entity67 's home in @entity9 hunting for clues into his death it was ms @entity106 ’s father , @entity120 , who suggested the cycling route towards the village of @entity123 along which mr @entity32 died			1
in the year since mr @entity32 ’s death , his surviving family have refused to release a photograph him , have never paid public tribute to him , and have attempted to keep all details of his life a secret			2
