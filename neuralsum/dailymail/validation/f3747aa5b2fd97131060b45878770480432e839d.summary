@entity1 's miserable career at @entity2 reached a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager @entity5			1
@entity1 has not played a minute of football for @entity2 's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over @entity9 last month and was left on the bench as @entity12 's stuttering team were knocked out of the @entity13 by @entity14 at home on monday night			1
now the £ 250,000 - a - week loan signing from @entity17 has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the under 21 team in their game against @entity21 on tuesday night			1
@entity1 losing his footing as he tries to escape the attentions of @entity24 ( left ) @entity1 reacts as a chance goes by ( left ) while @entity26 ( right , centre ) is congratulated on his goal @entity1 's spectacular fall from favour is starkly shown by the ' @entity32 ' badge on the arm of his @entity2 shirt @entity12 's decision to select the 29 - year - old in the @entity37 is indicative of the @entity2 manager 's ongoing concerns over the @entity42 international 's fitness levels			1
however , the @entity2 boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury			1
@entity1 has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of november and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal			0
@entity2 officials say @entity1 , one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last january , was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first - team 's clash with @entity21 at the same venue on sunday afternoon			1
@entity1 heads the ball towards goal but his drought goes on after another unsuccessful outing @entity66 reported earlier this year that @entity1 feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels			2
but on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from @entity5 after an anonymous performance			0
in a poor first half @entity1 dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker @entity81 's goal - bound effort wide from an offside position			0
@entity2 coaches ( left - right ) @entity83 ( @entity85 ) , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 ( fitness ) watch on @entity1 looks to get in between the @entity21 defence at @entity91 as @entity2 are held by @entity21 @entity1 has another effort on goal but is again frustrated as @entity2 searched for the winner expertly marshalled by @entity21 ' centre - half pairing of 17 - year - old @entity96 and @entity97 @entity24 , 28 , the @entity17 man cut a desperately frustrated figure			1
in the second half he was at it again when he diverted @entity103 's shot into the arms of @entity21 keeper @entity105 before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end			0
in contrast @entity109 right back @entity26 , fighting for his future at @entity2 , was a standout			0
he calmly intercepted @entity112 's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively @entity21 midfielder @entity115 's opener			0
having only scored four times during his six months at @entity2 , the chances of @entity1 being retained in the summer are almost nil			1
@entity2 have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while @entity1 feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by @entity12			2
after monday 's cup exit against @entity14 , @entity12 reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign @entity1 and release @entity126 last august			2
@entity126 returned to @entity91 to score the winner in @entity14 's 2 - 1 win			1
last night @entity126 said : ' @entity2 is a club that means so much to me			2
i 'm a fan and it 's hard to knock them out			0
i 'll always respect the fans			0
i had a lovely reception from them and i 'm thankful for that			0
' the @entity42 looks bemused as he is substituted before shaking hands with coach @entity138			0

@entity1 named in @entity2 under 21 side to play @entity21 on tuesday night
a day earlier the @entity42 was an *unused* substitute as @entity2 were knocked out of the @entity13 by @entity14
@entity1 is paid £ 250,000 - a - week and @entity2 have an *option* to *buy* him for £ *43.2million* in the summer
his *demotion* on tuesday night represented a new low in his loan stint at the @entity91 club
@entity5 does not usually ask players to play in the reserves unless they are returning from injury
