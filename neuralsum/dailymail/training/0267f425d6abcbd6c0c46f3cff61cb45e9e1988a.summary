@entity2 's @entity8 may boast idyllic scenery but it is overrun by pet dogs and the noise has prompted officials to take drastic action against repeat offenders			1

paw pooch : dog owners in @entity2 are turning to pet psychologists to save their animals from a draconian new law that makes ' incessant barking ' an offence following surging complaints from angry neighbours , the law in @entity8 is quite specific on noisy dogs , banning ' barks , bays , cries , howls ' that go on continuously for ten minutes or intermittently for 20 minutes within a half hour			1
the law still allows for a dog to bark over the allotted time limits if its owner is being attacked			2
some owners have complained that the new law infringes their rights but neighbours counter that 24 - hour barking is such a problem that they have to run fans next to their heads at night just to get to sleep			2
owners whose dogs fall foul of the law have been allowed to get professional help as a part of a plea deal to ensure they can hang on to their animals			2
experts such as @entity50 , who runs the @entity51 , are now offering classes in ' dog whispering ' where he teaches owners to make more effort to try to understand their troubled canines			0
mr @entity50 , a retired psychology professor , teaches that endless barking is often a result of dogs getting bored or of owners failing to communicate in a way their dogs can understand			0
he encourages owners to take their dogs on ' play dates ' with other dogs to make their day more interesting and cut down the tendency to bark just for something to do			0
' you have to focus on the cause as well as how to correct the symptoms , ' he said of incessant barkers			0
' in most cases , they do n't really need a therapist to come to their house			0
[ @entity77 ] just need a little better information about communication and mutual respect with a dog			0
' other parts of the @entity83 are cracking down on dog barking including @entity85 , which last year imposed a law imposing fines of as much as Â£ 630 ( $ 1,000 )			2
as in @entity2 , a few towns have set a time limit as to how long a dog can bark before it is breaking the law			1
but local officials stress that @entity2 's largest island has a particular nightmare with noisy dogs			1
people there use dogs to hunt wild pigs and many people own at least five and some as many as 30 .			0

officials on @entity2 's @entity8 have taken action with a new law making ' incessant barking ' an offence
police can write barking tickets , fine noisy dog owners and remove an uncontrollable yapper to a pound
