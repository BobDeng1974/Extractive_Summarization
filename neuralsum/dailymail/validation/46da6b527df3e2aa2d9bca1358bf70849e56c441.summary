it ’s one of the most famous scenes from any movie , let alone @entity3 : two raptors enter the kitchen , stalking two children - their human prey			1
but as the raptors make their screeches and calls , you might be surprised to know these sounds actually come from tortoises having sex			2
it turns out that many of the dinosaur sounds in the hit 1993 film were made by recording modern animals - including , bizarrely , tortoises mating			1
other dinosaur sounds were ' voiced ' by a variety of animals			1
these include horses , donkeys , cattle and a dog for the @entity40 in an interview for @entity43 , sound designer for the movie @entity41 confirmed the odd choice of sound effect			1
in august last year , researchers trained four red - footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats			2
the animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display , and even learnt which side of the screen to press			0
the animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real - life , offline experiment			2
professor @entity64 from the @entity65 led the study , alongside researchers from the @entity68			0
‘ yes , it ’s a mating tortoise , ’ when asked about the sounds they make			0
specifically , he says the ‘ bark ’ when one velociraptor first comes in the kitchen was created by recording a tortoise successfully mate with another at @entity75			2
‘ it ’s riding on the back of the female tortoise			0
so it ’s climbing up her shell basically , and then it falls off			0
it ’s a little sexual , ’ he said			0
this confirms what was reported by @entity86 back in 2013 , that tortoise sounds were behind the noise of the raptors			0
but this was n’t the only bizarre animal noise used in the movie ; it turns out horses , donkeys and even cattle were used for some of the other dinosaur calls			1
‘ the brachiosaur ’s singing is one of my favourite sounds in the movie because it ’s beautiful , but like all good sound design it 's made from a non-beautiful source , which is donkeys , ’ mr @entity41 told @entity86			1
in an interview for @entity43 , sound designer for the movie @entity41 confirmed the odd choice of sound effect			1
‘ yes , it ’s a mating tortoise , ’ when asked about the sounds they make			0
shown is a stock image of @entity117 giant tortoises ( @entity118 ) mating and even the @entity40 got the animal treatment , with mr @entity41 ’s own pet @entity122 terrier being used to voice the huge dinosaur			1
the fourth @entity126 film - called @entity124 and starring @entity127 - is scheduled to be released on 12 june 2015			0
and a trailer confirmed velociraptors would be making a return in the film - but whether they will similarly be voiced by mating tortoises you ’ll have to wait and see whether similar sound effects have been used			1
