’ the @entity8 interrupted her schedule for only an hour to attend the christening ceremony , have a cup of tea and a slice of cake , and pose for the official photographs			1
after the christening , she was driven straight back to @entity25 , and by 6pm she was hosting a reception for @entity24 , with several hundred guests thronging the @entity45 and @entity46			1

the talks , which also included a tour of @entity93 ’s private gardens to see a tree the peace campaigner had planted there last year , began at 1.45pm and ended at 2.30pm			0
this gave @entity75 and @entity92 just a few minutes to freshen up before meeting @entity120 and @entity82 with baby @entity121 at neighbouring @entity19			0
