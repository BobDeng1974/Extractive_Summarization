@entity0 can raise a smile as he imagines the vitriol that is likely to spew his way when @entity5 ’s side visit @entity6 ’s in the @entity7 on wednesday night , but there is still sadness at how he left @entity10 in scandal 15 years ago			1
‘ the tin hat may have to come out that 's for sure ! ’ laughs @entity0			1
‘ i think the fans wo n't be too complimentary about us			0
this was always going to be the case after what happened			2
’ @entity0 , 41 , regrets his actions from earlier in his career and now views it as his responsibility to advice his younger players against making similar mistakes			1
regret : @entity0 was sad that the t - shirt incident overshadowed the fact he enjoyed a good spell at @entity10 the @entity29 manager was a player at the @entity30 for two years following a controversial £ 2.5million move in 1997 from his boyhood club @entity32 , where he played more than 200 games			1
having provided a vital contribution from midfield as @entity38 ’s team earned promotion to the @entity40 , he then made a very ill - advised decision while watching the 1999 fa cup final at @entity43 with friends from @entity45			2
he pulled on a t - shirt bearing the words ‘ @entity51 * * * * * * * ’ in reference to @entity32 ’s rivals and his employers			1
photographers caught the moment and @entity0 ’ s time on @entity54 was over			1
@entity38 sold him to @entity55 and @entity56 , born in @entity58 heartland @entity57 , later said he had already been harbouring doubts about playing against @entity32 while wearing the red and white stripes of @entity10			1
only twice has he encountered @entity10 since , both during the 2005/06 season after he returned to @entity32 for a final campaign			1
he enjoyed two victories and received a reception he describes as ‘ hot , very vocal ’ during the 4 - 1 win at the @entity30			1
he expects more of the same on wednesday night in the @entity29 dugout			1
‘ being a player at the club and the well - documented incident that made us have to leave probably adds a little bit of spice , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i had two terrific years and that turned sour			2
‘ i ’m now more mature and in a position where i feel it is a regrettable incident			2
i 've had to move on from it			0
‘ it was n't as if i was walking round the streets of @entity78 , it was just a matter of seconds but you can imagine the amount of camera flashes			0
passionate : @entity0 is hoping to take @entity29 to the next level after just staying up last season ‘ i look back on it as stupidity			1
it 's not something you should be doing			2
‘ the toughest thing for me is everyone forgets the job i did for them as a player			2
that 's the biggest regret			2
it 's difficult for me to ever go and watch a game there like my other clubs			0
‘ that was my choice but i 'm a lot more mature now			0
i ’ve had to pay the consequence of my action			0
i 'd be disappointed if one of my players had done that			0
‘ i can not turn back time or change the past but i can affect the future			0
i 'd like to help players in the future			0
’ he adds : ‘ when the draw was made the phone was red hot			0
most of it was from the @entity32 end but there are still people i know from @entity10 days so it was a mixture			1
i do n't think i 'll be getting involved with anything with the @entity10 fans			1
‘ it is a special fixture			0
it ’s a @entity40 club and we had really good fixtures in this competition against @entity123 and @entity124 last year			0
‘ i saw @entity10 against @entity125 and it is a tough game as they looked very good			2
they could be a decent bet for top half of the @entity40			0
but i 'd love to cause a shock			0
' video we have to improve - @entity131			0
