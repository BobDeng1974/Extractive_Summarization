a baby orangutan finally has the strength to sit up and feed himself fruit after being caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life			1
@entity8 stole hearts around the world when his horrific story of neglect at the hands of his owner was revealed by @entity16			1
now donations to the charity nursing him back from the brink of death have now topped £ 20,000 - many of them from kind - hearted readers			1
vets from the @entity26 animal welfare charity said he is strong enough to lift a bottle of milk to his mouth and suck the juice from pieces of fruit			2
he was rescued in @entity35 by a @entity37 - based charity from a hellish life as a family pet and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home			1
he enjoys sucking the juice from slices of fruit strength : the tiny orangutan can now lift a bottle of milk if it is not too heavy and can sit up on his own since the baby orangutan 's plight was publicised , he has become an international celebrity and his story has prompted the biggest response for an individual appeal ever witnessed by @entity61 , the charity that brought him to safety in his native @entity64			1
@entity66 , from @entity61 , said : ' when @entity16 reported the story of @entity8 the baby orangutan on january 22 , it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world			1
' @entity8 has appeared on websites , blogs and tv in @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
' celebrities including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 have tweeted about @entity8 – and charity @entity61 has received a staggering £ 20,000 in donations towards the appeal to help treat and care for the little baby			1
' the charity is aiming to double that amount in the weeks ahead to cover the costs of @entity8 's care for what is likely to be six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild			1
' and if little @entity8 does n't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest , @entity61 will have to cope with the costs of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life			1
' and the latest news is that , slowly but surely , @entity8 is on the mend			2
' the charity estimates it will cost about £ 5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan			2
although he is in a stable condition , he is still not out of the woods and simple tasks exhaust him			0
before @entity111 was rescued , his owner had n't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him			1
her ignorance and neglect were killing the baby slowly and painfully , but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand @entity111 over			2
tasty : @entity8 sucks the juice from a piece of fruit after living off canned condensed milk for the first 10 months of his life ' we just hope we got to him in time and that someday , although it will be a long time from now , he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan ' @entity132 , the ceo of @entity61 charity said : ' he was deprived of all the nutrients that are vital to the development of a young baby			1
' his little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent			0
' he was completely unable to move or even sit up on his own			0
at more than a year old he should have been strong enough to climb and swing : instead he was as helpless as a newborn baby			0
' when our team lifted @entity8 out of his cage in @entity147 in @entity64 to prepare him for the journey to our rescue centre ten hours away in @entity150 , his eyes literally filled with tears and he cried in agony			1
' everyone was distressed beyond words to see how much pain he was in			0
i do n't know how much longer he could have endured so much suffering			0
' @entity8 had severe anaemia and months of malnutrition had left his joints swollen and badly deformed			2
he also had to be treated for a serious metabolic disease that may have caused permanent damage to his bones			0
the little orangutan could only sit up on his own for short periods and could not move his arms and legs fully			0
exhausted : @entity8 sleeping on a makeshift bed alongside his orangutan and @entity170 soft toys shortly after his rescue helping hand : @entity8 is being cared for by staff at @entity61 after being saved from the chicken coop weak : his little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent @entity179 now reports that @entity8 continues to improve every day			1
she said : ' each milestone achieved is a wonder , but we remember that it 's all relative			0
' the swelling and pain in his body has receded , but this has revealed the misshapen and weak muscles of his arms and legs			0
@entity61 , based in @entity192 , @entity191 saves animals , big and small , from suffering around the world			0
work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in @entity197 , rescuing primates from captivity in @entity35 , and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries			0
wherever possible , the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild			0
@entity61 works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals			0
sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision - making and determines the course of its rescue operations			0
it also works with other like - minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect			0
' @entity8 can lift a small bottle of milk to drink on his own now , but only if it 's not too full or heavy			1
' he is trying new foods all the time , and he is willingly opening his mouth to eat , but we are blending his food because he still has n't learned how to chew			2
however he enjoys sucking the juice out of slices of fruit			0
' we are excited that @entity8 can now sit up on his own for short periods of time before dropping off to sleep with the effort			1
' the team remains optimistic , as @entity8 has a strong spirit and is being provided with supplements , vitamins and the care he needs to correct his abnormalities and help him continue to develop			2
' we just hope we got to him in time and that someday , although it will be a long time from now , he will be able to live in the forest as a normal orangutan			0
