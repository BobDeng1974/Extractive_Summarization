by @entity0 @entity1 has been suffering from the cold after a fight with another ostrich left her with a large bald patch a zoo is appealing to @entity7 's knitters to help them keep one balding ostrich warm this winter			1
@entity1 , a female bird who lives on @entity9 in @entity10 , lost all the feathers on her back last summer during a fight with another ostrich			1
they have since failed to grow back , leaving @entity1 suffering from the cold and looking a little like a half - plucked chicken			1
zoo manager @entity17 said : ' most of the animals have grown glossy coats of furs or feathers to keep them warm this winter but @entity22 suffers from a rather large bald patch on her back meaning she is much more prone to feeling the cold than the other animals			1
' we have tried to put blankets on her to keep her warm but if anyone is willing to knit her a jumper , i am sure she would appreciate it very much			1
' we are also hoping that the warmth and natural fibres from a woolly jumper may stimulate the hair follicles in her back and cause her feathers to grow back			2
' ostriches naturally roam across central and southern @entity42 , and so are poorly suited to the cold			2
in their arid home they derive most of their water from the food they eat , which includes plants , roots and seeds , as well as insects , lizards and other small creatures			2
the species , the world 's largest bird , also has the largest eye of any land animal , and contrary to popular belief they do not bury their heads in sand when threatened			0
instead they lie low to the floor , perhaps giving the appearance of burying their head , before using their long legs and fast pace to flee predators			0
their legs are also useful for kicking , and can easily kill a human or lion with a single powerful blow			0
keepers hope the jumper 's natural wool fibers and the warmth it provides will mean the feathers grow back as well as ostriches , @entity9 zoo is home to a host of other birds , including emus and sacred ibis , whose distinctive long bills are used to probe mud for insects and beetles			1
@entity96 are related to ostriches , are similar in appearance and are also flightless			0
the emu is slightly smaller than its relation , and lives predominantly in @entity102 , rather than @entity42			0
like ostriches they will eat both plans and small insects , but will also swallow rocks in order to aid digestion .			0

@entity1 has a bald patch after fighting with another ostrich last summer
keepers are asking the public to knit a jumper to help keep her warm
they also hope the natural fibers might *encourage* feather - growth
