by @entity0 - jones published : 05:56 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 06:40 est , 17 january 2014 taking it on the chin : @entity4 , 49 , faces questions over his role as a director of @entity8			1
the @entity10 - based firm was used to funnel money between npower and its @entity15 owner @entity13 a top businessman who helped the @entity15 owners of @entity19 avoid paying millions of pounds of tax is now advising @entity21 , it has emerged			1
@entity4 , the former boss of the energy giant , oversaw the transfer of money through a @entity10 company which saved @entity13 from paying corporation tax in the @entity27			1
the loophole has since been closed , but questions have been raised over the suitability of mr @entity4 to sit on the @entity21 given his role in helping @entity13 with tax avoidance at a time when energy bills have been soaring			1
official figures released last year showed that the amount of tax lost through non-payment and avoidance increased in 2012 to £ 35bn			0
between 2008 and 2012 , mr @entity4 , 49 , was a director of @entity8 , which was run on a tiny budget out of an office in @entity10 and was used to divert billions of pounds from @entity13 , @entity19 's @entity15 owner , to the @entity27 company			1
this meant that @entity45 , which only had one employee earning less than £ 10,000 a year , made £ 885 million over four years on which it would only be required to pay as little as 5 per cent in the tax haven			0
although the scheme was legal , it is estimated that it saved @entity13 from paying millions of pounds of tax and has led to criticism of mr @entity56 's role advising @entity21			1
he was appointed as a @entity59 adviser at the start of last year , weeks after resigning as the chief executive of npower with an £ 850,000 payoff			0
@entity64 , the @entity66 mp and chair of the @entity68 , told the mirror : ' if mr @entity4 has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance , there is no way he should be advising the organisation whose job it is to maximise the tax collected			1
' raising questions : @entity64 , the @entity66 mp , said ' there is no way ' @entity4 should be advising the @entity21 if he has been involved in ' aggressive tax avoidance ' @entity78 of @entity79 echoed mrs @entity64 's comments			2
' he is a @entity15 national who has been a director of a company that has clearly been involved with tax avoidance			2
' how this qualifies him to supervise our national tax authority is hard to explain			0
' a spokesman for @entity19 argued that the reason they paid ' little or no @entity27 corporation tax ' was because of the investment @entity13 had made in the @entity27			1
' it is @entity59 policy to use tax reliefs to incentivise investment and it is saddening to be criticised for investing in secure and lower carbon energy that is desperately needed in this country , ' he said			0
' @entity19 does not engage in tax avoidance – borrowing money to fund investment in vital assets in the @entity27 is not tax avoidance			0
' the fact that we borrowed from @entity10 made no difference to our @entity27 corporation tax			2
' a spokesman for @entity21 said that ' rigorous vetting ' would have been carried out before mr @entity4 was appointed and that any conflicts of interest would have been checked			2
' non-executive directors bring valuable external and commercial experience to @entity21 , ' he said			0
' however , they are not responsible for the day - to - day management of @entity21 , nor are they responsible for tax policy or for handling confidential individual or corporate taxpayer issues			0
