by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 10:17 est , 26 october 2012 a dying schoolgirl desperately seeking a bone marrow transplant to save her from a rare deadly illness is being kept alive - with horse blood			1
@entity5 , 11 , has a form of aplastic anaemia which doctors believe can only be a cured by a transplant			1
the condition , also called bone marrow failure , affects the blood and is caused by the bone marrow and stem cells not producing enough blood cells			1
so far , @entity5 ’s desperate family have failed to find a match for the youngster			2
@entity5 , 11 , is dying from rare aplastic anaemia , which attacks her immune system			1
doctors are keeping her alive with medicine made from horse anitbodies			1
pictured with her mother @entity24 and sister @entity25 instead , the schoolgirl is having her dangerously weak immune system boosted - by horse blood			1
a serum from the equine blood is injected into @entity5 because it contains antithymocyte globulin ( @entity32 ) - an antibody which doctors hope will kick - start her immune system			1
incredibly , the treatment has a range of bizarre side effects , including the growth of facial hair			1
there is also a risk @entity5 could contract a deadly infection - but medics believe her illness is so bad the chance is worth taking			2
@entity5 will have to wait for four weeks after the treatment is completed to find out whether it has been successful			2
if it does n’t work , her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to come forward and save her life			1
@entity5 ’s mother @entity50 today launched an urgent appeal for more donors to sign up to the bone marrow register to ‘ secure @entity5 ’s life ’			1
she said : ‘ it ’s very difficult at the moment not knowing what will happen			0
my biggest fear is it not working and having to go through it again			0
‘ a transplant would secure @entity5 ’s life			2
even if we do n’t find a match , donors could save other people ’s lives			0
' @entity5 's sister , @entity66 , 24 , added : ' we are just desperate for her to be well again			2
@entity5 wants to go to sleepover parties and not worry about getting sick			0
she has just started secondary school and is only able to do three days a week			0
the nursery school teacher , added : ' there are so many risks with this treatment and her body could reject it or relapse from it at any time			0
doctors hope the antibodies will kick - start @entity5 's immune system			1
if not , her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to save her life ' she 's my little sister - i take her to have her nails done and treat her to shoes to try and cheer her up			1
' but there are only so many pairs of shoes you can buy - she just wants her life back			0
' every year , thousands of patients with blood cancer and other blood disorders are given transplants of healthy bone marrow			1
their own diseased marrow is first destroyed to prevent the new marrow from being rejected and to create space for the transplanted tissue			0
@entity5 , who lives with her family in @entity102 , @entity103 , was diagnosed with the condition by doctors at @entity106 after she had ten nose bleeds in just two weeks			1
the condition means her bone marrow fails to reproduce red and white blood cells and platelets , which prevent bruising , and leaves @entity5 with little resistance to infections			1
@entity5 , a student who loves football and swimming , has to have blood and platelet transfusions every week - spending days at a time in hospital			2
staff at @entity122 ’s hospital and the @entity124 charity , which manages the @entity126 bone marrow register , have searched world - wide but failed to find a suitable donor for @entity5			1
research shows that family members are not necessarily compatible and it is more likely that a complete stranger will be an exact match			0
children who do not have a brother or sister who is a good bone marrow match can be treated with a immunosuppressive therapy using antibodies from horse and rabbit blood			1
the horse therapy reduces the number of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream using drugs such as antilymphocyte globulin ( @entity32 ) and ciclosporin , which stimulate the bone marrow to restart blood cell production			1
@entity151 , consultant paediatric haematologist at @entity106 , @entity152 , said ; ' for children who do not having a sibling bone marrow match the second option is an unrelated match			2
' if , as in this case , we can not find a match we use horse @entity32 , which has an 85 per cent survival rate			0
' the antibodies are given to the patient in a liquid medicine intravenously through a central line in the neck			0
unfortunately , the main side effect of ciclosporin is extra hair growth on the body , which can be quite obvious on the face			2
patients can also suffer from high temperatures , rashes and swollen , painful joints			0
@entity5 has to be kept in hospital for three weeks and closely monitored in isolation as she will be prone to fatal infection while undergoing the treatment			0
dr @entity180 , consultant paediatric haematologist at @entity106 , @entity152 , said : ‘ ideally bone marrow is the best option but without a match we use @entity32			2
‘ it is a pretty intensive treatment and can result in serum sickness , but we can only carry out marrow transplants if we have a perfect match - it is essential for this condition , otherwise it wo n’t work			0
‘ @entity5 will be in hospital for three weeks and she will be kept in isolation and closely monitored for infection which in many cases can be fatal			0
’ he added : ‘ for most people , a transplant is a long - term solution			0
occasionally , many years down the line , people relapse			0
’ @entity203 anaemia affects only one in every 200,000 people and in many cases the reasons behind the condition are not clear			0
experts estimate only about 30 to 40 children are diagnosed with aplastic anaemia each @entity212 can affect anyone at any age but seems to occur most often in children and people over 60 years old			2
to help @entity5 visit facebook.com / thehelpzoecampaign @entity124 runs the @entity126 register of bone marrow donors			1
donors need to be between the ages of 16 - 30 and in good health			0
