@entity0 have agreed a deal with @entity2 for @entity3 with the goalkeeper set for a medical on wednesday as he finally heads for a permanent exit			1
the @entity7 spent last season out on loan at @entity9 after being frozen out by @entity10 , with seemingly no way back into the manager 's plans			1
@entity3 did fly out to @entity14 with the @entity15 last week and trained with the squad but did n't even make the bench against @entity18 in the @entity19 on monday night			1
@entity3 was eager to come to @entity2			1
' he wanted to embark on this adventure even though he knows that , in @entity37 , he has a keeper in front of him who , if nothing changes , will always remain the number one			0
' @entity10 has made no secret of preferring @entity44 in between the sticks as the @entity47 ' keeper immediately commanded the no 1 spot at @entity49 on arrival			1
the writing was on the wall for @entity3 from the get - go and @entity0 have allowed the 31 - year - old to talk to the @entity55 champions after a bid in the region of £ 2million			0
@entity3 has attracted interest from @entity9 and @entity59 although neither are able to match his financial demands with the keeper commanding around £ 110,000 a week			0
however , the finances are no problem for wealthy @entity2			1
@entity65 is for @entity3 to agree			0
@entity67 's side face an @entity68 on wednesday , but @entity3 is unlikely to be involved			0
and that could be a recurring theme , with @entity37 an immovable object in goal for @entity2			1
current @entity2 reserve @entity73 and rival @entity75 each featured in two games last season			2
@entity3 fits the bill as an experienced alternative after starring on the @entity82 and international stage for @entity0 and his country			0
@entity0 are wrapping up a deal for @entity86 from @entity87 and are continuing negotiations with @entity89 over a £ 16m deal for @entity92 left - back @entity91 which could yet include 20 - year - old midfielder @entity94 going to @entity89 on loan			0
no chance ! @entity10 has frozen out @entity3 , who spent time out on loan at @entity9 last year no moving : @entity44 has been @entity10 ' no 1 goalkeeper since signing from @entity100 as well as adding to his defensive ranks , @entity67 also seems keen to keep hold of the players he has and on tuesday dismissed reports linking central defender @entity105 with @entity106			1
@entity92 's @entity108 radio suggested the @entity110 club were closing in on the @entity112 defender , an alternative candidate to his compatriot @entity114 to reinforce the @entity117 side 's defence this season			0
but speaking at a press conference in @entity120 , where @entity2 are currently preparing for the new season , @entity67 said there was no truth whatsoever to the story and he had no intention of letting the former @entity127 defender go			2
@entity128 : @entity67 says @entity2 defender @entity105 wo n't be leaving the club this summer ' i do n't usually say anything about things i read in the newspaper , but i am planning 100 percent with him here , ' @entity67 said			1
the @entity7 added that he did not expect club bosses to order him to sell any of his first - choice players either as the @entity136 prepare an assault on a hat - trick of @entity140 titles this season			2
he need not worry about that in the case of @entity105 , though , with @entity27 telling the @entity145 newspaper that the rumours were ' laughable '			0
@entity105 joined @entity2 from @entity127 in 2011 and he extended his contract until 2018 only last december			2
