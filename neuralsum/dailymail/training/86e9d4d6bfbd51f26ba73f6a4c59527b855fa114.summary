@entity0 has brushed aside calls for a ‘ conscience clause ’ to protect @entity3 who are persecuted for their beliefs			1
the prime minister yesterday dismissed the idea following the scandal over the decision by the state equality watchdog to sue a bakery firm which refused to bake a cake celebrating gay marriage			1
the cake , ordered by a gay rights group , would have been decorated with a slogan saying ‘ support gay marriage ’ and two characters from @entity18			1
the @entity19 is now taking the @entity21 owners of the bakery to court for breaking sexual orientation regulations			0
questioned by @entity25 , mr @entity0 declined to offer support for the idea of laws to defend @entity21 beliefs			2
instead he told the @entity30 that gay equality rights are part of being @entity33			0
’ the prime minister ’s line contrasted with his call three months ago for more support in @entity33 for @entity21 and the moral code that goes with it			2
mr @entity0 ’s latest intervention comes at a time of deepening political and legal argument over the rights of @entity3			1
one senior judge , @entity52 deputy president @entity51 , has backed the idea of a ‘ conscience clause ’ to help @entity3 who want to live by their belief that gay sex is wrong and that same - sex relationships can not be marriages			1
the gay marriage cake case , which stemmed from the refusal of the @entity21 - owned @entity61 to make a propaganda cake for the @entity64 pressure group , appears likely to extend the reach of equality laws			1
in the past the law on sexual orientation , passed amid a @entity70 rebellion by @entity72 ’s government eight years ago , has been taken to mean that businesses could not refuse to serve customers on the grounds that they are gay			0
however the @entity78 - based bakery which is now being taken to court by the @entity19 in @entity80 did not refuse to serve its customer , activist @entity81 , on the grounds that he was gay			0
@entity83 cuts the cake , made by another bakery , with the @entity18 puppets and ' support gay marriage ' slogan decorated on it @entity61 - named after a verse in the @entity89 - turned down an order for a cake featuring @entity18 puppets @entity93 and the slogan ' support gay marriage ' rather its owners refused to produce a cake designed to convey a message with which they did not agree			1
mr @entity0 was asked at @entity43 ’s questions by @entity103 mp @entity102 if he believed the legal action against the bakery was ‘ an oppressive threat to religious freedom ’			2
mr @entity102 suggested that ‘ such freedoms should be protected by the introduction of a conscience clause			2
’ the prime minister said : ‘ i was not aware of the specific case , and i will of course go away and have a look at it			2
‘ however , i think that a commitment to equality — whether we are talking about racial equality , equality between those of different sexes , equality in terms of people who have disabilities , or , indeed , tolerance of and equality for people with different sexualities — is a very important part of being @entity33			0
’ the pm claimed he was not aware of the incident but said ' equality ' was an important part of being @entity33 @entity0 was responding to a question by the @entity103 ’s @entity102 , who said afterwards : ‘ there have been a number of cases across the @entity33 where so - called equality legislation has impeded the ability of people to uphold their religious beliefs			1
‘ this latest case locally has seen a family - owned bakery threatened by legal action because they would not print a political slogan onto a cake			2
such a message ran contrary to the company ’s christian values			0
‘ it is disappointing that the prime minister would not comment on the need for religious freedom to be protected through the introduction of a conscience clause			1
’ the @entity158 mp added : ‘ tolerance needs to be a two - way street , but this case highlights that currently those who can not support a particular political campaign may find themselves forced before the courts			0
’ the idea of a conscience clause was raised last month by @entity51 , the judge who presided over the most important @entity21 rights case yet to come before the @entity33 courts			1
in the case , which involved @entity178 guest house owners @entity170 and @entity171 and their refusal to accommodate a gay couple in a double room because they were not married , @entity51 found against the hoteliers			0
but last month @entity51 made a speech in which she said the decision may have been wrong , that the law may have been too harsh on @entity3 , and that the law should find a ‘ conscience clause ’ to allow @entity3 to live by their beliefs			1
mr @entity0 ’s support for equality is in line with his introduction of same - sex marriage laws			0
his government also decided to oppose @entity3 who went to the @entity192 claiming their beliefs meant they should be able to wear a cross at work and be excused jobs that meant they would have to help gay couples			0
however the prime minister has also said in recent months that @entity33 is a @entity21 country and that @entity21 beliefs are important			1
mr @entity0 wrote in the @entity200 in april : ‘ i believe we should be more confident about our status as a @entity21 country and , frankly , more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people ’s lives			0
‘ for people who do have a faith , that faith can be a guide or a helpful prod in the right direction , and whether inspired by faith or not , that direction or moral code matters , ’ the prime minister said .			0
