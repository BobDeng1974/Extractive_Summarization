by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 18 july 2012 they have a reputation for faultless efficiency and planning events with meticulous detail			2
so perhaps we should be worried that @entity7 already believe @entity8 will be an ' @entity9 - sized disaster '			1
@entity7 's leading news magazine has launched an attack on @entity13 ’s preparations for the @entity8 , poking fun at facilities and warning that the @entity9 are destined to go down in history as a gigantic ' soggy mess '			1
provocative : a @entity7 magazine article has poked fun at @entity13 's preparations for the @entity9 , warning we can expect an ' @entity9 - sized disaster ' venue : an aerial photograph of the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity7 say it will host a ' soggy mess ' the article in @entity30 trashes numerous aspects about the @entity9 , from the ' clattering ' tube system that will transport most spectators to @entity9 venues to pavements that are ' too narrow ' and a passport control situation at @entity37 bordering on chaotic			1
' @entity26 and the @entity9 are clearly not made for each other , ' it said			1
' visitors will need determination and , most of all , patience to reach the venues at all			1
and , for the locals , it all ca n’t end soon enough			2
' controversial : the article appeared in this edition of @entity30 , @entity7 's leading news magazine the article claims that the @entity8 , which will run from july 27 to august 12 , will be an ' arduous obstacle course for everyone '			1
' starting this week , the world ’s biggest financial centre will be gripped by a special condition usually only seen in wartime , ' it reads			0
' its 7.8million inhabitants are about to be joined by an average of 1million additional visitors per day			2
' the already overloaded public - transportation system will be burdened with an additional 3 million fares per day			0
' a total of 109 miles of the city ’s streets will be closed off to normal traffic			0
' almost twice as many soldiers as @entity13 has in @entity65 , a helicopter carrier and special forces units armed to the teeth will make the city look like it ’s under siege			0
' the @entity7 , whose last efforts at hosting the @entity9 saw @entity73 athletes murdered in @entity74 in a security fiasco in 1972 , then criticise an aspect beyond our control - the weather			1
it reads : ' and then there ’s @entity83 ’s classic bad weather , which has some wondering whether the @entity84 will turn into a fiasco			0
' the weather has been cold , wet and gloomy since the spring , with last month proving to be the wettest june on record			0
' the meteorologists ’ @entity9 forecasts are nothing short of dismal : rain , rain and , yes , more rain			1
and it wo n’t just be falling on the athletes , but also on the most highest - priced seats in the @entity24			0
3 the number of times @entity26 has held the @entity9 ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 ) 30 new bridges built inside the @entity98 in @entity25 , east @entity26 200 number of buildings that had to be demolished to accommodate the site 587 acreage of @entity98 3,000 @entity103 footage of world 's biggest @entity104 - just 200 yards from stadium 200,000 total workforce needed 700,000 total capacity for all venues 4billion people expected to watch the @entity111 9.3billion cost in pounds sterling of staging the @entity9 ' optimistic planners decided not to cover those seats , unlike the rest of them			1
' the long and rambling article takes aim at many features of @entity121 life , even making fun of child obesity			2
' and the children ? they have n’t become athletes , either , ' it states			0
' on the contrary , the boys and girls of the @entity129 are among the fattest in the @entity131			0
' @entity26 ’s poor @entity132 now has an @entity98 and the largest shopping centre in the @entity131 -- but it ’s still poor			1
' the article finishes : ' though @entity26 has many natural gifts , they are n’t of the kind that makes it ideal to host such a major event			2
' and because @entity13 is both a debt - ridden and democratic country , it was n’t possible to radically reshape @entity26 for the event , as the @entity143 did with @entity144 in 2008			2
' the 2012 @entity8 will probably end up looking like the host city itself : a little chaotic , a little infuriating , never perfect , but with a lot of room for improvisation , charm and talent			0
' those who live there will be delighted , of course , but only once it ’s over			0
' ' under siege ' : two soldiers pass the @entity24			0
the article comments on the large numbers of @entity160 personnel on duty at the @entity9 lampooned : @entity7 have made fun of @entity26 's ' clattering ' @entity163 , which will take the majority of visitors to @entity9 venues getting ready : a carpenter checks the track at the velodrome in the @entity98 in @entity25 , east @entity26 @entity170 carries the @entity9 flame on the torch relay leg between @entity173 and @entity174 , in @entity175 poking fun : the article claims that , for @entity178 , the @entity9 ca n't end soon enough			1
