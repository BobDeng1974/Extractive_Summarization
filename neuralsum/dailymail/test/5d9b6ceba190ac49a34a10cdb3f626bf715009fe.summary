education secretary @entity0 today signalled she would quit the @entity2 if the @entity3 entered a power - sharing deal with @entity5			1
the senior @entity6 said @entity7 is ' not my cup of tea ' and would question whether she was ' happy to serve ' with the @entity5 leader			1
@entity13 has urged @entity5 supporters to ' come home ' to the @entity6 , but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the @entity17 party if he falls short of a majority			1
the @entity5 leader was greeted with silence in the hall when he said during the debate about the @entity32 that of the 7,000 diagnosed with @entity27 , 60 per cent were born abroad			1
after saying this was something the other leaders would be ' mortified that i dare to even talk about it ' , he said : ' you can come to @entity28 from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with @entity27 and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to Â£ 25,000 per year per patient			1
' i know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world , but what we need is to put the @entity32 there for the @entity28 people and families who have paid into this system for decades			2
' it later emerged the comments were pre-planned in what @entity5 insiders called a ' shock and awful ' strategy			2
in an interview with the @entity59 , mrs @entity57 condemned the remarks			0
she said : ' to say that in a calculated way to appeal to your core vote is pretty stomach - turning			0
' she added it is a ' legitimate question ' to ask senior @entity3 about the make - up of future coalitions , if as the polls suggest no party gets an overall majority			0
@entity5 leader @entity7 , who spent today on a boat in @entity72 with reality tv star @entity73 , has said he is not seeking ministerial office in a coalition			1
but mrs @entity57 suggested she would not be willing to sit around the @entity2 table with @entity5 : ' i can give you the answer which is that we are not talking about anything but a majority government			2
' but i think if we end up in coalition discussion territory people will have to ask themselves who they are happy to serve with			2
' it is difficult envisaging what might happen but @entity7 is not my cup of tea			2
' mr @entity7 , who spent today on a boat in @entity72 with reality tv star @entity73 , has said he is not seeking ministerial office in a coalition			0
but he would demand a referendum on @entity28 leaving the @entity94 as the price for @entity96 supporting a @entity6 minority government			0
however , recent polls have suggested support for @entity5 is slipping and mr @entity7 might struggle to win his own seat in @entity101			1
mr @entity7 yesterday admitted @entity5 has ' slipped back a bit ' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party 's supporters has waned			1
the @entity5 leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in november to just 12.25 per cent today , with voters appearing to switch to the @entity3 in the run up to the election			1
mr @entity7 is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the @entity3 in @entity101 , @entity114 - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his @entity6 rival just two months ago			0
speaking on a tour of the @entity118 , he added : ' we are exactly where we were last august , having won the @entity122 elections - we were on 14 - and - a - bit per cent			0
' we won the @entity122 elections , we found that level and we did have a rally in the @entity125 through the remarkable events of first @entity127 and then perhaps more remarkably the @entity128 by - election ' we 've slipped back a bit since then , there are 30 days to go and i think the issues @entity5 is campaigning on are back in play			1
' @entity13 has urged @entity5 supporters to ' come home ' to the @entity6 , but has stopped short of ruling out having to rely on the @entity17 party if he falls short of a majority mrs @entity57 is the only senior @entity6 minister defending a marginal seat , in @entity140			1
elected in 2010 , with a majority of 3,744 , mrs @entity57 became a treasury minister in 2013 before being promoted to the @entity2 in july last year			0
her rejection of the idea of power - sharing with @entity5 comes after weeks of contradictory statements from senior conservatives			1
in january , @entity6 chairman @entity148 insisted his party would not enter a deal with mr @entity7			2
he said : ' i can rule [ it ] out , we are not going to do pacts and deal with @entity5 , we are looking for an overall majority			0
' but mr @entity13 has only said that he is pushing for a majority , telling @entity157 in february : ' i 'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory			0
' on tuesday he issued a plea to those who had left the @entity6 fold : ' look , we 've heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we 'll change those things			0
come with us , come back home to us , rather than risk all of this good work being undone			0
