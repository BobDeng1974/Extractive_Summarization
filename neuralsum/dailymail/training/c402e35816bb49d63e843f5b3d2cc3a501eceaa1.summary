with the @entity2 countdown under way , there was a moment when @entity5 squared up to @entity6 after the @entity8 midfielder nobbled him with a reckless first - half challenge			1
these are the final - day fears for any top player , the injury scares that can ruin the best - laid plans of any @entity15 manager			2
on sunday , as @entity5 kept his 14th clean sheet of another title - winning season for @entity20 , he came through unscathed			1
@entity21 can breathe a sigh of relief			0
@entity5 will recall that the wheels came off for him earlier in the season , notably in defeats at @entity43 and @entity44			0
he spent a few weeks in the cooler , taken out of the team after his costly error at @entity48			0
by the time @entity20 played their next game , in the @entity51 at @entity52 , @entity49 had taken his place in the team			0
on sunday , as @entity5 wrapped up his second @entity27 title - winners ’ medal , he appeared back to his commanding best			1
he was submerged by @entity20 fans as they raced on to the pitch to salute their heroes and laud @entity61 for his first league title			0
as inept and lamentable as @entity8 were , @entity5 was safe and secure in goal			0
back in august , @entity5 began the season with a clean sheet as @entity20 beat @entity52 4 - 0			1
on sunday he finished it with another			0
he is in good nick , enjoying his football again after that early - season wobble			0
bad patch : @entity5 ( centre ) was dropped from the @entity20 team after his error allowed @entity44 win 2 - 1 in october support : despite his poor form , @entity15 boss @entity21 insisted @entity5 would be his number one choice this is all good news for @entity21 , who backed him throughout his difficult period			1
even when @entity5 was unable to force his way back into the @entity20 team , @entity21 picked him to start a prestige friendly against @entity82 at @entity83 in november			2
@entity21 always said @entity5 would be his first choice at the @entity2 and he will be in goal when @entity15 face @entity86 in @entity87 on june 14			1
@entity15 - and @entity5 - could do without @entity20 ’s trip to @entity89 this week to show off the @entity27 trophy and a game against @entity92			1
@entity21 has been assured @entity5 and @entity93 , another @entity15 player in decent nick , will be rested from thursday ’s friendly			2
they will return at the end of the week before travelling to the @entity97 for the start of @entity15 ’s @entity2 preparations .			2
