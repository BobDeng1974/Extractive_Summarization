by @entity0 @entity1 makes her departure from @entity4 in this week 's explosive episodes @entity7 's honeymoon seems like it might be permanently on hold			1
she and her husband @entity9 were due to fly to the @entity10 earlier this year , when she was asked to return to @entity4			1
now , having worked for five months on the soap 's major summer storyline leading up to her dramatic departure this week , @entity1 says the couple only have one thing on their minds - and it 's not lying on a beach			1
' we 're both exhausted and really need this honeymoon , ' says @entity21 , who married theatre director @entity22 in march			1
' most people would just book it			1
but we 're thinking , " what if a job comes in ? " you could say we 're workaholics ! @entity9 is working at the @entity28 and i 'm already auditioning for other roles , so i might be tied up in another drama by the end of the year			2
' @entity33 - born @entity1 's been in the thick of the action since joining @entity4 as troublesome @entity35 in 1998 , aged just 13			1
her storylines included killing her headmistress in a hit - and - run accident , attempting suicide with an overdose and catching a sexually transmitted disease			2
later , @entity35 joined the police			2
in 2008 , however , @entity1 thought she risked being typecast and decided to spread her wings			1
she won roles as @entity46 in @entity49 musical @entity47 , and as @entity50 in the @entity52 tour of @entity53			2
but @entity21 , now 28 , was lured back by the promise she 'd be at the heart of a blockbuster plot			2
' i jumped at the chance , ' she says			2
the plot involved @entity35 , who 's dying of asbestos - related lung cancer mesothelioma , bringing her five - year - old daughter april back to the village so the youngster 's father @entity64 can care for her			2
desperate for money for april 's future , corrupt copper @entity35 teams up with crook @entity70 for a series of robberies , including one this week			1
' there 's a hostage situation , where @entity35 has to make a split - second decision that will have tragic consequences , ' @entity1 reveals			1
' it will really shock viewers			0
' ' i 'm very proud of @entity35 's final scenes , which include a dramatic robbery and a hostage situation			0
she also makes a touching video message for her daughter april to see when she grows up			0
i was very nervous about the scene but it went so well the whole crew applauded			0
' @entity35 manages to record a video of herself for her daughter to watch when she 's gone - and @entity1 says filming the emotional scenes left her worn out			1
' i 've cried so much i feel i 've been through therapy , ' she says			0
@entity1 believes the storyline is a fitting finale to her @entity4 career			1
' hopefully this will show casting directors i mean business			0
but even if nothing happens after this i 'd feel very happy and proud i got to play this great storyline			0
' that does n't mean she is n't sad to go			0
' there were tears on my last day , ' she admits			0
' but it 's definitely the right decision			0
' @entity1 turns 29 on friday and has very clear goals			1
' by this time next year i 'd love to have appeared in a period drama or performed at the @entity110 , ' she says			0
' at 30 , i 'll start thinking about having a family			0
oh yes , and of course i 'd like to visit the @entity10 ! ' holidays – beach or city ? i like @entity115 , where there are shops , shows and cocktails ! meat or fish ? fillet steak every time – i 'm a real @entity123 or cats ? i 'd like a furry dog like a @entity126			0
i 've got my fingers crossed for my birthday this week ! wine or spirits ? vodka – with lime and lemonade			1
but my hangovers are getting worse as i get older ! @entity135 ? @entity137 – it 's the perfect blend of comedy and @entity139 or @entity140 ? @entity140 – she 's versatile , down - to - earth and a great role @entity144 or football ? i associate tennis with strawberries , sun and @entity149 's – so that wins it for me !			0
