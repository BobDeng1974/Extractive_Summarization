by @entity0 a tiny new species of animal dubbed the ' water bear ' has been discovered living in @entity4 - and it 's so tough it can survive in space			1
scientists found the creature - a member of the tardigrade family - on a trip to @entity11 some 3,500 miles ( 5,600km ) south of @entity12			1
a number of them , no bigger than half a millimetre , were lurking on mosses within a crater hollowed out by ancient glaciers			0
the tiny creatures are certainly strange - looking with their eight chubby legs , little claws and probing heads			2
these bears are less than 1mm long and are found in the sea , in fresh water and on land			2
some experts have compared their shape with jelly babies or moles but tardigrades they should not be judged by their ' cute ' appearance			0
they are virtually indestructible - they will not die even if they are boiled , frozen , squeezed under pressure or desiccated			0
in fact , they can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened			0
members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains , hot deserts and the deep ocean - and now in @entity4			1
members of the tardigrade family have been found in high mountains , hot deserts and the deep ocean - but never in @entity4			1
and they 're so resilient to harsh environments they 've even been exposed in space by astronauts - and remarkably survived the experience			0
the water bear is the only kind of creature known that can survive in the vacuum of space			2
the widespread and ancient microscopic animals , found in moss and lichen , feed on plant cells or small invertebrates			0
but they can survive the rigours of @entity4 because they have also been tested with extremes of cold , heat , pressure , dehydration , poison and radioactivity			1
members of the tardigrade family ( new species , pictured ) have been found in high mountains , hot deserts and the deep ocean - but never in @entity4			1
their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red - orange body colour and cushions behind its claws ( pictured )			1
there was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species water bears can be completely dried out for years - and then spring back to life as if nothing had happened dr @entity100 of the @entity101 , who helped verify the find , said : ' under the microscope they are slow walkers but they look like bears walking			1
' they have four pairs of legs but they can hold their back tow legs down and arch themselves up to reach things			0
' the cone - shaped mouth has a little hole in the middle for food and it has two eyes which can sense light too			0
' their muscles help them manipulate their claws like a human hand being opened and drawn back in again and they look rather like an armadillo			0

the widespread and ancient microscopic animals , found in moss and lichen , feed on plant cells or small invertebrates water bears have been tested with extremes of cold , heat , pressure , dehydration , poison and radioactivity ' but if you can imagine any environment , you will probably find a tardigrade there - they have an incredible resistance			1
' they 've been tested in space , under liquid nitrogen , put under pressure and had chemicals thrown over them but they 're fine after being washed in water			0
' researchers even breed from the ones that were sent into space on @entity159 and @entity160 missions			0
' researchers led by dr @entity162 from the @entity163 in @entity164 found the new creature while on a trip to @entity11			1
their examination under an electron microscope revealed various unusual features - including its red - orange body colour and cushions behind its claws			1
there was also a distinctive pattern of hairs on its body - suggesting the scientists were dealing with a new species			2
further studies are to be carried out to determine how these new features benefit the animal but it is the furthest south a member of this tardigrade genus has ever been found			2
it was already known to be present in large swathes of @entity186 and @entity187			0
dr @entity100 added : ' it does n't seem to travel well so it 's quite an unusual genus to find a new member of , particularly in @entity4 where there are relatively few good tardigrade habitats			0

creature was found on @entity11 , 3,500 miles south of @entity12
it is a member of the tardigrade family - a micro-animal with 8 legs
new species has a red - orange body colour and cushioned claws
they have *previously* been found in hot deserts and the deep ocean
water bears can survive extremes of cold , heat , pressure , dehydration , poison and radioactivity
