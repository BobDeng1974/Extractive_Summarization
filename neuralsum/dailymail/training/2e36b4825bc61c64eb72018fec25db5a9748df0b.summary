@entity0 , 37 , wants to be named to show up police and help other victims of sex attacks @entity4 has admitted that their investigation was flawed by @entity6 last updated at 11:22 pm on 1st march 2012 hurt : distraught @entity0 , 37 , says her life had been wrecked after she was attacked when her drink was spiked on a night out a mother has told how her life was left in ruins after police made her feel like a liar when she reported being raped			1
@entity0 told officers she was sexually assaulted in her own home by a man who had spiked her drink in a nightclub			1
but she says the detectives did not take her allegations seriously and sided with her attacker			2
her claims were backed up by an internal inquiry that found key witnesses were not interviewed and the suspect ’s house and car were left unsearched			2
although a suspect was arrested , the case did not reach court through lack of forensic evidence – another failing in the police investigation			1
miss @entity0 , who has waived her anonymity to detail her ordeal , said her life was in ruins despite being vindicated by an apology from @entity40 police			1
‘ i know what happened to me – i was violated in the most horrendous way , ’ said the 37 - year - old mother of four			1
‘ someone raped me and no one ’s been punished			2
but i was made to feel like a liar			2
my whole life has changed			2
i went from being bubbly and outgoing to being paranoid and scared			2
‘ because of this horrendous experience i lost my business			0
‘ i now suffer from panic attacks , depression and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			1
sorry is not good enough			0
my life stopped when i was raped			0
i have spent all my time since then trying to get justice			0
‘ i just hope what i have been through helps change things for other victims			1
’ miss @entity0 was attacked on a night out with friends in her home town of @entity61 in july 2008 to celebrate the opening of a beauty salon she had set up			1
because she was driving , she bought only one glass of wine , which she asked a doorman to look after while she went to the lavatory			0
‘ i vaguely knew this guy , as i had seen him in my local gym and i thought as a doorman he would be responsible , ’ she said			0
‘ after i finished my drink i started to feel very peculiar – my legs felt funny and my friends said we should go home			0
‘ apparently this doorman offered to drive my car home , as i felt awful and my friends had had too much to drink			0
the next thing i remember is waking up and he was on top of me			0
‘ i wanted to scream and scream but nothing would come out of my mouth – it was as if i was paralysed			0
my young children were asleep next door and i was just terrified			0
apology : det @entity86 , of @entity4 , has said a new structure was now in place for ' allegations of rape are always taken seriously			1
' ‘ i must have passed out as when i woke up again my head really hurt , i was totally naked and he had gone			0
‘ i was so terrified and distraught i went straight to the bathroom and started scrubbing myself with a nail brush			0
’ miss @entity0 said her attacker had warned her ‘ not to do anything stupid ’ after the incident			1
she defied this harassment and reported the crime to the police five weeks later			1
however , the @entity101 decided not to proceed with charges due to lack of evidence			0
after making a complaint to the @entity105 , miss @entity0 was told in may 2010 that @entity40 police ’s professional standards department would review the investigation			1
her complaint was upheld last june when the force apologised			0
officers reopened the investigation but could not re-interview the suspect as there was no new dna evidence			1
miss @entity0 said the force ’s response had made her feel she was being branded a liar			1
the investigation stated : ‘ forensic opportunities were not considered , telephone evidence not sought , key witnesses not interviewed regarding the connected harassment incident , or re-interviewed in the case of the female acquaintances who had been with the complainant			2
‘ equally , searches of the suspect ’s home or the car used were not carried out , neither was he re-interviewed after conflicting accounts were obtained from the witnesses			0
’ while revealing that the officer who interviewed miss @entity0 was trained to deal with rape inquiries , the report states the officer in charge of the inquiry had no specialist training in sexual offences			1
detective chief superintendent @entity139 of @entity4 said : ‘ @entity0 made a complaint to @entity4 via the @entity105 in relation to how her case was investigated , which was reviewed by our @entity143			1
‘ as a result the @entity143 made a number of recommendations , which assisted with the new structure for rape investigations			0
@entity4 has created a countywide @entity150 with specialist rape - trained officers who work with the victim from the outset to ensure they receive the best possible support , advice and guidance			1
they follow national protocol and best practice compiled from forces throughout the country			0
’ earlier this week a criminal justice joint inspection study criticised police in @entity164 and @entity165 for dismissing more than one in ten rape allegations to secure a higher conviction rate and meet targets			2
it warned that target cultures have put forces under pressure to keep recorded crime to a ‘ minimum ’ and that foreign rapists could be escaping justice because police are failing to check the background of suspects .			2
