@entity0 , 22 , asked a waiter to give her ' date ' an old photo and letter			1
the note detailed jibes the bully made at school about her weight and mono - brow for one @entity12 student , revenge was a dish best served cold			1
after nearly ten years of waiting , @entity0 last week got her own back on the bully who called her ‘ manbeast ’ as a teenager			1
the 22 - year - old had been reunited with her former classmate at a university @entity21 ball			1
she had undergone a stunning transformation in the intervening years – so much so that the young man apparently did n’t recognise her and asked her out to dinner			1
but miss @entity0 – who was picked on at school because of her weight and appearance – did not show up			1
instead , she asked a waiter to hand the man a photograph of her younger self accompanied by a note			1
the letter , which she later posted online , read : ‘ hey , so sorry i ca n’t join you tonight			1
‘ remember year 8 , when i was fat and you made fun of my weight ? no ? i do – i spent the following three years eating less than an apple a day			1
so i ’ve decided to skip dinner			2
‘ remember the monobrow you mocked ? the hairy legs you were disgusted by ? remember how every day for three years , you and your friends called me manbeast ? ’ she added that he probably did n’t – or he would n’t have deemed her attractive enough to treat her ‘ like a human being ’			2
‘ i thought i ’d send you this as a reminder , ’ she said			2
‘ next time you think of me , picture this photo , because she ’s the one who just stood you up			2

@entity74 student @entity71 , who is from @entity75 , later received a reply on @entity54 from the man she stood up			0
it said : ‘ hey … for what it ’s worth , i was actually here looking for a chance to meet up to make friends , not because you are very good looking			2
‘ i guess i had it coming though , and certainly do n’t blame you for standing me up			0
the letter @entity0 wrote to a former bully who asked her out on a date , along with a picture of her as a school child ‘ i ca n’t change who i was 8 years ago , and i wo n’t insult your intelligence by pretending it did n’t happen , but i hope you believe me when i say i ’m a different person now			1
‘ i can only apologise and wish you the very best			0
i guess i wo n’t hear from you again but i mean it when i say i hope you have every success you deserve			0
’ speaking after the story spread around the world , miss @entity0 said : ‘ i think it ’s crazy and quite overwhelming , i was n’t expecting it to go this viral			1
‘ i think every tabloid ever has now printed something on me			0
i was pretty happy with @entity103 magazine though – i was listed hero of the week , alongside @entity107			0
’ do you know the man in this story , or are you him ? if so , please contact the @entity112 team on @entity113 @entity0 later received a reply on @entity54 from the man she stood up that apologised for his behaviour			1
