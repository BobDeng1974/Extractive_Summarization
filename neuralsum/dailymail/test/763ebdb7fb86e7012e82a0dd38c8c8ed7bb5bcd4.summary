for many people there is nothing worse than wasting food , especially when it comes to that half eaten loaf of bread			2
but now @entity7 has come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap			1
and whilst it might sound like an unusual move , they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time			1
@entity7 have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven the first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap			1
it does n't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water			0
then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside			2
for a small loaf you need to allow around 6 - 7 minutes and for a large , or particularly wet one , around 12 to 13 minutes			0
the experts say it works because : ' the water turns to steam , which rehydrates the bread ’s crumb , or interior , while the heat of the oven firms up the crust			0
' when you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is @entity51 spoke to @entity53 nutritionist @entity52 who said that the water trick does actually work , but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day			1
' whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water / heat method , it is beneficial not to waste food , ' she said			0
' ' once you have put your ‘ watered ’ bread in the oven or microwave , make sure you eat it within the day , as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria			1
@entity69 says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day she continued : ' there is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread , and you must watch out for mould			2
' bread should be disposed off if it has orange , green , yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache			0
' when bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that it is about to go mouldy , so give the bread a thorough check before consuming			0
