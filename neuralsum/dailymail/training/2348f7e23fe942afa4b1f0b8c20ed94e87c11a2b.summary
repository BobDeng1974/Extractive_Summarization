by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 18 october 2012 a dazzling white smile is a prerequisite for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red carpet : they do n't call it a @entity8 smile for nothing			0
but not every a-lister in @entity11 is keen to buy into the trend for the blinding white fake teeth that have become so prevalent in the showbiz world today - and motormouth @entity15 is one of them			0
the @entity19 presenter has been voted as having the worst celebrity teeth in the @entity11 after a poll was carried out to discover which famous face had the most discoloured teeth			2

' although @entity64 has paid a lot of money for his dazzling white teeth he was still voted as having the worst cosmetic smile while @entity28 topped the list of bad celebrity smiles for his yellow teeth bad cosmetic dentistry obviously runs in the family after @entity74 and his cousin @entity75 were voted as having the worst whitened teeth it was n't only tan - toothed stars that were drawing criticism though			1
