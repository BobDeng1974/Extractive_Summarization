by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 15:18 est , 4 november 2013 a memo has been reveals that shows how the president was warned about problems with the implementation of his signature healthcare legislation years before the website went live			1
one of the campaign staffers who became an expert on president @entity11 's health care legislation during the 2008 race wrote a memo to @entity14 in 2010 warning that there would be catastrophic issues with the roll out			1
@entity18 has now shared a copy of the memo that he sent three years ago with @entity21 , showing how called for the inefficiencies to be addressed but was ignored			0
head start : healthcare advisor @entity18 sent a memo to @entity14 warning him of the problems with the proposed healthcare roll out in may of 2010 ' i do not believe the relevant members of the @entity30 understand the president 's vision or have the capability to carry it out , ' @entity18 wrote in a memo to @entity14 , who was working as a top @entity36 economic advisor at that point			1
in the wake of the massive technical problems with the website , there have been a number of memos and documents released showing the waves of unheeded warnings			2
the most explicit of which came from the tech contractors hired out to create and test the website before the launch on october 1			0
the september 6 report states that they viewed it as a ' near certainty ' that problems would result from their ' limited testing timeframes ' and the small number of predetermined scenarios that they were given for trouble shooting			0
blame game : @entity14 , who previously served as the treasury secretary , was heading up the @entity62 at the time that he received the memo the major differences between that report , which was directed to the @entity66 , and the memo written by @entity18 are the time and direction			2
mr @entity18 's memo was written more than three years before the contractor 's report , and he sent it directly to @entity14			1
mr @entity14 went on to serve as the head of the @entity36 's @entity62 , meaning that he worked closely with the administration and should have been able to alert his colleagues about the stern warning as they crafted their public message			1
' you need to have people who have understanding of the political process , people who understand how to work within an administration and people who understand how to start and build a business , and unfortunately , they just did n't get all of those people together , ' mr @entity18 told @entity87			0
' it is frustrating any time you really want to see something succeed because you believe it 's good for people , and it does n't get off on the right foot			0
' under fire : the president 's @entity96 website has been up for more than a month and he continues to ignore calls for it to be taken down and rebooted given the major technical problems			0

president @entity11 's healthcare aide sent a memo to then *-* @entity36 advisor @entity14 in may 2010
said that the people involved in the healthcare roll out did not know how to run a business and were *lacking* in necessary *skills*
this is one of the *earliest* warnings released in light of the failed website
