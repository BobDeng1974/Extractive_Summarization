he banned reporting of the case of @entity0 , 30 , and her brother @entity13 , 34 , to prevent them allegedly being shamed in the eyes of their community			1
in the latest farce involving secret justice , the pair were told they could enjoy the court ’s protection because members of their family would pass judgment if the case was reported			1

however , following a challenge by the @entity4 , the restriction was lifted – enabling the case to be reported			1
judge @entity36 reversed his original ban after deciding that the principle of open justice was more important than saving the embarrassment of a defendant			2
after almost a year of court appearances and legal argument , miss @entity0 has been convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice , while her brother was acquitted of the charge			1
they were on trial accused of helping their father , @entity50 , dodge a speeding fine by pretending he was not driving at the time of the offence			0
in a saga with echoes of the @entity59 scandal , he allowed a man who worked for the family to take the blame instead			0
at the beginning of the hearings , miss @entity0 ’s barrister , @entity63 , argued she would not give evidence properly in the presence of the @entity68 because she was afraid of family repercussions			1
he said she did not want to criticise her father in public – though she was quite happy to have her mother sit in the public gallery			0
‘ miss @entity0 is quite upset that if matters are reported she does n’t feel she would be able to give her evidence as freely as she would have done otherwise , ’ said mr @entity63			1
‘ culturally , it ’s very difficult for them to say things in public			0
the evidence would be impacted on by the cultural background of @entity82			0

some months later , the day before @entity112 was due before magistrates , her brother faxed the court a letter on @entity112 ’s behalf , saying he wanted to plead guilty by post			2
@entity112 was fined £ 100 with £ 30 costs and six penalty points for the speeding offence			1
prosecutor @entity122 said : ‘ there is no dispute in this case that the man actually driving the car was @entity83 ’s father			1
‘ it was hoped by supplying the false details that the trail would be lost and the fixed penalty unit would eventually take no further action			0
but the suspicions of the unit were aroused			0
’ @entity83 successfully argued he did not realise what was going on and had only been trying to help @entity112 by filling in the form using information provided by him			2
