@entity0 has made a thundering comeback after being sent into exile by the scientific community			1
the long - necked dinosaur was one of the largest animals to ever walk the @entity7 with its legacy captivating children 's imaginations the world over			0
but despite the ' thunder lizard ' being deep rooted in popular culture , for more than a century scientists believed the infamous dinosaur never existed			0
the giant dinosaur and its evocative name - meaning ' thunder lizard ' - has enthralled generations of @entity20 since 1903 , experts have believed the creature was originally misnamed			0
pictured is a @entity0 as researchers see it today -- with a @entity25 - like head the researchers looked at 477 anatomical features across 81 individual dinosaurs found in museums throughout @entity29 and @entity30			1
instead of the traditional method of plotting how similar each species is to the others , they instead used a ' specimen - based protocol '			0
this meant they could analyse each individual animal , despite its species , and allowed them to look at differences within each species , as well as between different species			1
the main shape of the tree supported what other paleontologists had previously proposed			0
but fossils that were originally labelled @entity0 appeared different from two @entity0 species			1
most of the differences were in tiny anatomical features , but one distinctive trait was that @entity0 has a wider neck than @entity0			1
since 1903 , experts have been arguing the creature was originally misnamed			0
instead of belonging to the genus , or species ' family ' @entity0 , they said it should in fact have been classified as ' @entity0 '			1
now new research has shown that it is , after all , sufficiently different from @entity0 to deserve its own genus name			1
scientists from the @entity64 and @entity65 submitted the evidence for resurrecting @entity0 in a study almost 300 pages long published in the open access journal @entity70			1
' the differences we found between @entity0 and @entity0 were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera , and much more than what you normally find between species , ' said dr @entity78 , one of the authors from @entity80			1
the researchers used statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of ' diplodocid ' dinosaurs - a group that included some of the longest animals that ever walked on the @entity7			1

pictured is the revised family tree the scientists claim that three known species of @entity0 exist — @entity0 , which was the first discovered , along with @entity124 and @entity125			1
they also found two members of the group , @entity25 and @entity129 , may have reached lengths of up to 112 ft ( 34 metres )			0
@entity0 , also from the group , had an average length of 75 ft ( 22.8 metres ) , and weighed around 16.4 tonnes , they said			2
colleague @entity132 , from @entity133 in @entity65 , said : ' our research would not have been possible at this level of detail 15 or more years ago			0
' in fact , until very recently , the claim that @entity0 was the same as @entity0 was completely reasonable , based on the knowledge we had			2
' in 1877 , @entity143 ’s crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed @entity0			1
two years later , he found another giant dinosaur and named it @entity0 ( pictured ) @entity132 ( left ) and @entity147 examine a @entity149 skull , a genus of diplodocid dinosaurs , as part of the study the complex history of the the @entity0 has its roots in the ‘ bone wars ’ of nineteenth - century			1
this was characterised by a race between paleontologists @entity161 and @entity143 defined the era to find dinosaur fossils			0
in 1877 , @entity143 ’s crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed @entity0			1
two years later , he found another giant dinosaur and named it @entity0			2
in the early 1900s , after discovering a fossil that was similar to both @entity0 and @entity0 , other researchers decided that the two dinosaurs were of the same genus			2
eventually , palaeontologists agreed that @entity0 should be named @entity0			2
this was under rules that state that the first name given for an animal takes priority			0
@entity0 has a complex history			2
in the 1870s , palaeontologists led by @entity143 discovered two enormous partial skeletons of long - necked dinosaurs in the @entity30 and shipped them to the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183			0
@entity143 described the first of the creatures as @entity0 , the ' deceptive lizard ' , after the @entity187 hero @entity188			2
two years later , he named the second skeleton @entity0 , the ' noble thunder lizard '			2
neither skeleton was found with a skull , and @entity143 reconstructed one for @entity0			2
however , his reconstruction , based on evidence from another long - necked dinosaur , @entity194 , was later found to be wrong			0
shortly after @entity143 's death , scientists from the @entity196 of @entity197 found another skeleton similar both to @entity0 and @entity0			1
in fact they were so similar that experts decided it would be correct to treat them as two species from the same genus : @entity0			1
the final blow to @entity0 came in the 1970s when researchers showed that @entity0 / @entity0 was not closely related to @entity194 but @entity25 , another dinosaur from the same era			2
@entity25 had a slender , horse - like skull , rather than the box - like one reconstructed by @entity143 and modelled on @entity194			0
@entity0 is one of the most charismatic dinosaurs of all time , inspiring generations of children thanks to its size and evocative name			0
but researchers long believe @entity0 was in fact a misnomer , and it should be correctly referred to as @entity0 ( artist 's impression pictured ) paleontologists @entity132 and @entity147 are pictured measuring a sauropod dinosaur femur on the right			0
on the left is an artist 's impression of @entity0 the myth was born that @entity0 was actually an apatosaurus with the wrong head			0
in science , the distinction between species and genera is without clear rules			0
but the researchers argue the to resurrect @entity0 was not a matter of personal preference ' we tried to be as objective as possible whenever making a decision which would differentiate between species and genus , ' said professor @entity132			1
' it 's the classic example of how science works ' , said professor @entity147 , a collaborator on the research			0
' especially when hypotheses are based on fragmentary fossils , it is possible for new finds to overthrow years of research			0
' pictured is @entity0 as researchers imagined it in the late 1800s : aquatic , and with a large , robust skull			0

since 1903 , scientists have been claiming @entity0 does *n't* exist
they said the famous species should be classified as an @entity0
new study calculated the differences between families of @entity264
@entity0 had a thinner neck and *slightly* different bone structure
