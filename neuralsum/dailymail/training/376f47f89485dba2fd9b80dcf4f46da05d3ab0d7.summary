by @entity0 a multi-millionaire who believes @entity2 should be separated into six separate states says he has gathered enough signatures to place it on the ballot in two years			1
venture capitalist @entity7 , 55 , says the @entity9 is too large to govern efficiently , and that people living there would be better served by a more localised government			2
the technology investor has proposed splitting the state into six : @entity15 and @entity16 would become @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity18 would make up @entity19 , the @entity21 area would be known as @entity22 , and @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 would make up @entity26			2
' it ’s important because it will help us create a more responsive , more innovative and more local government , and that ultimately will end up being better for all of @entity47 , ' said @entity48 , a spokesman for the campaign			1
' the idea ... is to create six states with responsive local governments - states that are more representative and accountable to their constituents			1
' @entity48 said monday that the campaign had gathered more than the roughly 808,000 signatures needed to place the measure on the november , 2016 ballot			1
@entity7 and other supporters plan to file the signatures with @entity2 secretary of state @entity62 on tuesday			1
but the plan has raised bipartisan hackles across the state , and opponents say it stands little chance of gaining voter approval			1
if @entity2 did vote for the change , it would then be up to the @entity71 to authorise the new states ' inclusion into the union which opponents say is also unlikely			2
should @entity2 be split into six separate states ? ' this is a colossal and divisive waste of time , energy , and money that will hurt the @entity2 brand , ' said @entity82 , a @entity83 political strategist who has formed the group @entity84 with @entity86 strategist @entity85 to fight @entity7 ’s plan			1
' it has zero chance of passage			0
but what it does is scare investment away ... at a time when the governor is leading us to an economic comeback			0
campaign : mr @entity7 , who made his name investing in companies such as @entity101 and @entity36 has set up a website to promote his scheme the six carved out states would look like this : @entity106 : the northern part of the state , including @entity109 and @entity111 counties			1
@entity22 : the wine country counties of @entity113 and @entity114 , as well as the @entity116 region			0
@entity34 : including @entity117 , @entity118 and most of what 's considered the @entity120			0
@entity26 : the vast central valley farm region , including @entity122 and @entity24 counties			0
@entity19 : including @entity18 and @entity17			0
@entity2 : including what 's called the @entity125 and @entity126 , plus @entity15			0
' @entity7 's plan would split the world ’s eighth - largest economy along geographic lines			2
one state , to be called @entity34 , would include the tech hub along with the @entity120			0
@entity106 , named after the third @entity41 president , would encompass the northernmost region			2
the state capital of @entity21 would be in @entity22 , while @entity2 would be made up of @entity15 and the eastern suburbs of @entity137 itself would be part of a state called @entity19			0
were his plan to be implemented mr @entity7 , who made his name , and some of his fortune , investing in @entity36 and @entity101 , would find himself living in the @entity34 state as he lives in @entity146 - located between @entity117 and @entity118 , and ranked number two on @entity149 's most expensive zip codes			1
proponents say the division would help create a more business - friendly environment , solve the state ’s water issues , and ease traffic congestion			2
more than 38 million people call @entity2 home , making it the most populous state in the @entity41 , and if it was to be its own country it would boast the world 's eighth largest economy			1
@entity2 is also the third largest state by area , taking in almost 164,000 square miles of coastline , mountain ranges , several huge cities such as @entity17 and @entity15 , and desert			0
urban : the state is home to several huge cities , including @entity17 which has a population of 3.85million diverse : @entity2 covers almost 164,000 square miles - from densely populated cities to the desert , such as @entity175			0

@entity7 says he has enough signatures to place it on the ballot
wants to chop the most populous @entity41 state into smaller entities
says it will create responsive local governments
plan has raised bipartisan hackles across the state
opponents say it stands little chance of gaining voter approval
