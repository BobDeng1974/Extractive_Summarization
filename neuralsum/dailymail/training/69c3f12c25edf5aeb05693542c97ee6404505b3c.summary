the amount of space junk orbiting earth has reached a ' tipping point ' where continual collisions are thickening the already dense cloud shrouding the @entity8 , a @entity1 report has revealed			1
in practical terms , it means that the amount of junk floating around the planet will make it increasingly difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet , effectively trapping us on earth			0
it also poses ' potentially catastrophic risk ' to astronauts , satellites and the @entity22			1
surrounded : this @entity1 image shows the wider circle of space junk surrounding @entity8 , as well as the tighter cluster of objects in low orbit around the planet junk cloud : @entity32 , this computer - generated @entity1 graphic shows objects of space junk in @entity8 's orbit that are currently being tracked - hundreds of thousands more are not being tracked - while , right , the size of the objects has been exaggerated in this @entity38 image to add emphasis to the threat since the first object , @entity43 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			1
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
it is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity8 's orbit			1
the picture above shows a ball of twisted metal , thought to be fallen space junk , on a farm in @entity61 , @entity62 , in 2008			0
' we 've lost control of the environment , ' said retired @entity1 senior scientist @entity66 , who authored the report			1
there are 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
it is estimated that there are as may as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity8 's orbit , traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1
several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk were put forward in an earlier report called ' @entity84 ' , by a @entity86 science think - tank			2
it mentions giant cosmic versions of harpoons , nets , tethers , magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella - shaped device that would sweep up tiny pieces of debris			0
while the new report does not recommend using the technology , mr @entity66 said it is needed			2
he favours one private company 's idea of a satellite that is armed with nets that could be sprung on wayward junk			0
attached to the net is an electromagnetic tether that could either pull the junk down to a point where it would burn up harmlessly or boost it to safer orbit			0
the latest evaluation report says : ' scenarios uncovered conclude that the current orbital debris environment has already reached a ' tipping point '			1
' that is , the amount of debris ... currently in orbit has reached a threshold where it will continually collide with itself , further increasing the population of orbital debris			0
' the increase will lead to corresponding increases in spacecraft failures , which will only create more feedback into the system , increasing the debris population growth rate			0
' the report , limiting future collision risk to spacecraft , was commissioned by @entity1 last april to evaluate its programmes on ' space junk ' , officially known as @entity134 ( @entity135 and @entity136 )			1
while it says that the current @entity140 programmes have used their resources well , it notes that there was a 10 year - plan between 1981 and 1991 to combat the problem , there has been no concerted effort since 1991			0
fallen : a piece of space junk that landed in a field in the rural @entity140 in the 1990s it also warns that the proposals to begin tackling the issues are expensive and could be sidelined or underfunded in the current economic climate , despite the threat it poses in the future			2
since the space age began 54 years ago , civilization has littered the area just above @entity8 's atmosphere with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches , as well as old satellites			1
when scientists noticed that this could be a problem , they came up with agreements to limit new space junk and those plans had been working			0
those agreements are intended to make sure what is sent into orbit eventually falls back to @entity8 and burns up			1
but two events in the past four years — a 2007 @entity175 anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash - in - orbit of two satellites — put so much new junk in space that everything changed , the report said			2
the widely criticized @entity175 test used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground , the report said			0
' those two single events doubled the amount of fragments in @entity8 orbit and completely wiped out what we had done in the last 25 years , ' said @entity66			1
all that junk that means something has to be done , ' which means you have to look at cleaning space , ' said mr @entity66 .			0
