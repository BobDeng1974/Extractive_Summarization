by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:19 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 4 october 2013 when a pensioner arrived at school to take his six - year - old granddaughter to the gp , teachers fetched a girl from class and off they went			1
only it was n’t his granddaughter – and because the 74 - year - old has very poor sight , he did not notice			1
the man , who has not been named , then took her on a mile - long bus journey to the @entity6 , where she was prescribed @entity16 , and dropped her off back at school			1
mistake : the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , sent the wrong six - year - old to the @entity6 with a pensioner who had come to collect his granddaughter it was not until the youngster went home and showed the medicine to her puzzled parents that the mistake was discovered			1
yesterday @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , launched an investigation into how such a blunder could have happened			1
the mistake took place on tuesday after the girl ’s parents telephoned the school to say her grandfather would arrive to take her to the doctors ’ because she was ill. but the girl handed over to him was not his granddaughter – although she is in the same class , shares the same first name , has similar blonde hair and is around the same height			1
and when she was asked if it was her grandfather , she nodded			0
@entity6 : the grandfather took the girl to the @entity47 , @entity20 , ( pictured ) where the doctor did n't realise he had seen the wrong girl			1
the girl 's father realised it was down to several ' honest mistakes ' last night the girl ’s father , a 36 - year - old systems tester for an it company , said he thought his ‘ shy ’ daughter may have thought the man was her dead grandfather			1
‘ a little bit of pressure was put on her and she felt like it was the right thing to do to agree it was her grandfather , ’ he said			0
‘ we have pictures of him up in our home so i think she got confused			0
’ the father , who asked not to be named , realised something was wrong when his daughter said at home , ‘ here is my medicine ’			1
on the bottle were the name and details of a different girl in her class			1
he added : ‘ my daughter ’s been known to tell a tale or two so i took her to the surgery and the doctor said , “ i saw her this morning with her grandfather ”			0
‘ it could have been worse			0
the doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for			1
’ he said he now realises the confusion arose after ‘ several honest mistakes ’			0
‘ it is very strange that a grandfather would not know his granddaughter , but i understand he has poor sight , ’ he said			1
‘ thank @entity100 it was an innocent thing done by a confused old gentleman			0
’ he added : ‘ the first thing i thought was the worst			0
i had to ask my daughter the sort of questions no parent ever wants to ask , “ did he do this , did he do that ”			0
when your daughter has been walked round town and taken on a bus by a strange man it makes you sick to the stomach			2
’ map : aerial view to show @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 ( circled left ) and the @entity47 ( right ) where a grandfather took the wrong girl to the doctors on the bus the girl ’s parents believe the receptionist wrote down her first and second name rather than the correct surname			1
both girls are six , in the same class , are the same height and have blonde hair			2
the mistaken girl lives with her father , @entity135 manager mother , 37 , and younger brother in @entity19 , @entity20 , has not suffered an ill - effects from the incident			1
but her father said : ' i went ballistic			0
the first thing i thought was the worst			0
' i had to ask my daughter the sort of questions no parent ever wants to ask , ‘ did he do this , did he do that			0
when your daughter has been walked round town and taken on a bus by a strange man it makes you sick to the stomach			2
it ’s every parent ’s worst nightmare			0
' everyone knows to tell their children not to go with strangers but i want to tell every parent in that school - tell them again tonight			2
' he added : ' my daughter ’s been known to tell a tale or two so i took her to the surgery and the doctor said ‘ i saw her this morning with her grandfather ’			0
' it could have been worse			0
the doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for			2
' the practice manager of the surgery said she ’s been there for 25 years and she ’s never seen anything like it			0
' the school is now reviewing its safeguarding policies			0
headteacher @entity181 , who called staff into a crisis meeting after the incident , said the safety of pupils is ' of the utmost importance '			1
mrs @entity181 said : ' the safety and care of all of our children is of the utmost importance to us and we are treating this matter extremely seriously			1
as soon as we realised this had occurred , we launched an investigation			2
' this has not only involved speaking to staff to find out how this could have happened , it has also involved reviewing all our procedures in connection with children ’s safety			2
' i have also spoken with the mother of this child to offer our sincere apologies over this regrettable incident and to assure her that we are reviewing all our safeguarding policies - with the help of the council - to ensure this never happens again			2
' the practice manager at @entity47 , where the girl was taken , have refused to comment			1
the incident has been referred to social services by police .			0
