by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 22 february 2013 tv presenter @entity0 , who is currently fronting @entity1 , was recently invited to visit @entity2 in @entity3 to see how money raised by the charity is helping make a difference to the lives of families there			1
during her stay , the 35 year old was shocked to learn that millions of children around the world are dying from diarrhoea , an illness that can be treated quickly here in the @entity17			1
as she recalls in her own words below , she was moved to tears when she met one mother who had lost her two year old daughter after she became sick with diarrhoea from drinking dirty water ... tragic : @entity0 at the graveside of two year old miracle who died because her diarrhoea could not be treated emotional : the presenter was shocked that so many mothers like @entity31 , pictured , are losing their children to treatable illnesses it ’s early morning and i ’m driving through lush green mountains to reach a rural village called @entity38 , enveloped by fields of tobacco and maize			1
although beautiful , the stunning scenery masks the real hardship that people here are facing			0
it ’s the rainy season and while the crops are thriving , the 400 families in this village are struggling to find enough food to eat while they wait for the next harvest			0
i ’m visiting during the hunger months , which bite between january to march when two million of the country ’s 16 million population regularly go without food			0
the wet weather also means that they have to deal with a sharp rise in cases of malaria and diarrhoea			2
preventable : @entity0 hopes people will donate to charity so less families will suffer in the future comfort : @entity0 said she struggled to imagine what @entity31 must have been through in this village alone , i ’m told that 84 out of 89 households have experienced childhood deaths or serious illnesses , from preventable diseases like diarrhoea , pneumonia and malaria			1
that ’s a truly shocking statistic			0
i meet @entity31 , 23 and her husband @entity80 , 30 , who live here with their gorgeous eight month old son @entity82 and 10 year old daughter , @entity84			1
as if conditions are n’t hard enough , @entity31 tells me that the borehole that supplies their clean drinking water regularly stops working leaving the whole village thirsty			1
it means they ’re all forced to use the filthy water from the nearby river to drink , cook and wash their clothes			2
not surprisingly , it makes them all sick with diarrhoea , which leaves their babies and children dangerously dehydrated , and explains why there are so many deaths here			1
like other mums , @entity31 has no choice but to use the murky river water			2
she shows me a bucket full and i know if i drank it , i ’d be rushed to hospital but they have no option			0
maternal : @entity0 hopes to become a mother herself one day health risk : but the people in @entity2 often have no choice but to drink the dirty water as she shows me the river , i ask whether her family has suffered much illness			1
that ’s when she tells me that her two year old daughter miracle died after having diarrhoea from drinking the water			1
' it 's so awful , i ca n't stop myself from crying			2
i hope to be a mum one day and the thought of losing a child is just too terrible ' i ’m completely gob - smacked			0
i had no idea that she had lost a child due to drinking this water , it ’s so awful , i ca n’t stop myself from crying			1
i hope to be a mum one day and the thought of losing a child is just too terrible			0
i put my arm around @entity31 and give her a big hug as she describes what happened on that february day in 2009			0
tearfully , she tells me that @entity138 became poorly with diarrhoea in the afternoon and they took her to a clinic the next day			2
but it was while she was being transferred to hospital to receive treatment that the terribly weak toddler lost the will to live			2
it ’s utterly heart - breaking to hear and i ’m at a loss to know what to say			0
i look up and see children swimming and playing in the river			2
it ’s such a worrying sight			0
we take clean drinking water for granted back home			1
we just go to the kitchen and turn on the tap and there it is			0
my younger sister @entity159 has a 14 month old baby called dash who i absolutely adore			0
for me the thought of him having to drink this brown disease ridden water and not surviving something like diarrhoea is unthinkable			1
hope : money raised by @entity169 helps provide clean drinking water for the villagers and vaccines to protect the children from illness back home we can treat diarrhoea easily			1
but it ’s one of the leading killers of children worldwide , claiming the lives of around 1.5 million children every year			1
but despite this grim statistic , there is hope for the future			0
thanks to money raised through @entity187 , @entity169 is funding @entity188 to purchase more vaccines in @entity2 , giving thousands of children a chance of a healthy life			1
in the @entity17 we ’re protected from birth from preventable diseases			0
imagine if the children in @entity3 had the same opportunity			1
miracle might still be with us			0
eye - opening : @entity0 with @entity31 and her family whose experiences made her realiise how much we take for granted in the @entity17 my day at @entity203 ends with @entity31 and her husband taking me to @entity138 ’s graveside			2
it ’s a peaceful spot tucked away among the fields of crops and trees			0
a simple headstone records her short life ‘ born 11 september 2007 - died 8 february 2009 ’			0
it ’s such an incredibly emotional moment			0
i just ca n’t believe how unfair it is that a mother with an eight month old son has to visit her two year old daughter ’s grave			2
the rotavirus vaccine came too late for little miracle and her brother @entity82 , but with your help and just a £ 4 donation to @entity187 , we can help to protect thousands of children from easily preventable illnesses like diarrhoea .			1
