controversial : the @entity14 accepted @entity17 chief @entity16 's resignation after she dismissed two deputies and suspended other career federal employees over the $ 820,000 conference it also included a $ 95 - per - person dinner and reception as well as various violations of federal laws and policies , and costs for a clown and a comedian , according to the @entity39			1
' as the agency @entity41 has entrusted with developing the rules followed by other federal agencies for conferences , @entity17 has a special responsibility to set an example , and that did not occur here , ' the inspector general concluded in its report			1
@entity17 chief @entity50 and @entity16 's top adviser , @entity51 , were forced out			1
four @entity17 employees who organized the five - day conference for the @entity17 's western region have been placed on administrative leave pending further action , a @entity14 official said			1
the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the embarrassing episode within the federal agency that oversees office space and supplies , transportation and management tasks			0
' on his first day in office , president @entity70 made clear that the people who serve in his administration are keepers of the public trust and that public service is a privilege , ' @entity14 chief of staff @entity68 said in a statement			0
' he was outraged by the excessive spending , questionable dealings with contractors and disregard for taxpayer dollars			2
forced out : @entity17 chief @entity50 , left , and @entity16 's top adviser , @entity51 , right , were fired after the controversy ' he called for all those responsible to be held fully accountable given that these actions were irresponsible and entirely inconsistent with the expectations that he has set as president			1
' the planners spent more than $ 136,000 on a pre-conference visit to @entity6 , including $ 57 lunches , according to an internal review first reported by the @entity39			2
that report also found ' redundant and wasteful ' practices , such as hiring outside event planners when the agency already has in - house workers for those tasks			0
those outside planners received a $ 12,000 commission from the resort , which the investigators said ' strongly indicates that further discounts might have been available to @entity17 if @entity17 had contracted the hotel directly			1
' the report also found costs that exceeded the original projections and officials who skirted federal rules that set aside some contracts for small businesses			2
the internal review found questionable actions , such as the event planner asking the hotel that an agency employee who arrived a day early get ' a friend of a friend of the owner rate ( wink )			2
' another agency employee sought a discount on a $ 98 purse from the hotel gift shop			1
she received a $ 30 break			1
the conference also spent $ 75,000 for a training exercise to assemble 24 bikes that were later donated at the agency 's direction to the @entity132			1
any equipment purchased with taxpayer dollars is supposed to be sold during government sales , but planners attempted to skirt those rules by having the trainers claim ownership of the cycles			0
luxurious : the @entity22 and @entity141 in @entity23 , @entity24 , where the 300 - person event that included $ 6,300 on a commemorative coin set , and $ 75,000 on a training exercise to build a bicycle in 2010 , took place plush : one of the expensive rooms in the @entity6 hotel where the five - day conference took place planners spent $ 31,000 on a ' networking reception ' that featured a $ 19 - per - person ' @entity155 artisanal cheese display ' and $ 7,000 in sushi			1

' sen. @entity179 , the top @entity180 on the @entity181 , called the conference a ' junket '			0
' it is never appropriate for an agency to fund lavish conferences that waste tax dollars , ' she said			0
' this is especially true at a time when @entity155 families are struggling to put food on their own tables and the @entity155 government is piling up debt at an historic pace			0
' @entity16 seemed to agree			0
' i find the information in your report to be very troubling as it outlines potential violations of federal procurement laws and agency policy , ' @entity16 said in a memo that accompanied the inspector general 's report			0
' over the top ' : taxpayers footed the bill for a $ 3,200 session with a mind reader amongst other lavish expenses unnecessary : the luxury $ 800,000 training conference also allegedly featured a clown the @entity14 found out about the draft internal report in early march , and @entity68 and @entity14 counsel @entity217 investigated the conference for employees of @entity17 's western region			1
@entity70 later was told of the findings and demanded accountability			0
@entity16 put in place new rules to prevent future spending , such as dealings that went around bidding rules , ignored contracting requirements and questionable expenses such as tuxedo rentals - but they were not enough to keep her in her job			0
' i fell i must step aside as administrator so that the agency can move forward at this time with a fresh leadership team , ' @entity16 wrote in her resignation			0
' collectively , the people of @entity17 now must review , repair and rebuild			1
