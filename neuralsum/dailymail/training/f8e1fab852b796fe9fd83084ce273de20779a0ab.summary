a century ago , @entity0 was a bustling community of 200 people who passed their days hunting seals and their long winter nights dancing beneath the wide @entity7 skies			1
but now , after a series of tragedies , the island stands deserted , reduced to a collection of crumbling , empty homes - a mere skeleton of the thriving neighborhood it once was			2
seventy years ago , as the island 's men were shipped off to battle in @entity20 and a savage outbreak of tuberculosis claimed many of those left behind , numbers began to dwindle			1
the lure of jobs and better medical care on the mainland also added to the exodus , and finally the @entity29 closed the island 's only school in 1959 because of fears of a rock slide			1
' in short , the fabric of @entity0 extended family life was shredded without cause , ' the @entity58 reported			2
' the stated reason for the move ... was that a boulder was about to roll down the hill and crush the school			0
more than 50 years later , the boulder still has n't moved			2
' before the tragedies and fears of rock slides , families had lived on the island - which is 40 miles west of the mainland - for thousands of years , propping their community up on the steep , rocky banks			1
the island , which is just a mile long , was inhabited by a group of @entity78 who called themselves @entity80 , which means ' @entity81 '			0
the small village was named @entity0			2
the men gained fame as hunters and ivory carvers , and survived on walrus , seal , birds and berries before heading to the mainland in the summer to sell their carvings			2
former homes : an image from 1928 shows @entity0 when around 200 residents would have lived there villagers : @entity0 residents in kayaks in an image taken around 1892			1
the kayaks are the characteristic @entity0 style as they carry more than one person or items on deck community : a group of men aboard a ship from the island in 1898 ; the men caught seals and fish way of life : pictured in 1928 , an @entity78 man on @entity0 uses a bow - drill to drill a hole in a walrus tusk today , the mystique of the tiny deserted island lives on , with the granddaughter of former residents finally achieving her wish to visit their one - time home			1
@entity125 had been raising money to fund a two - week trip to @entity0 , a tiny village of houses built on sticks along the jagged island , when an unnamed foundation donated $ 32,000			1
ms @entity125 had been struggling to raise the money to visit when she received the anonymous gift			0
' i 'm still in disbelief , ' mrs @entity125 , who is half @entity78 , said			0
' i 've been trying to wrap my head around it			0
' for years the 35 - year - old , who lives with her husband and children in @entity141 , has felt drawn to the village , which was deserted in 1966			1
she wants to spend two weeks at the remote spot , taking photographs and finding inspiration for her writing			0
today : the village , built on the slope of the island , is now deserted following fears of rock slides treacherous : @entity0 is a mile in size and around 40 miles from the mainline , and 90 miles from @entity48 on her fundraising page mrs @entity125 says she wants to make the trip while ' my mother and her remaining siblings - as well as others who were born and raised on the island - are still alive , interested , and capable of making the trip together to ensure that @entity163 remain connected to our ancestors , culture , and place of origin '			1
the writer , who is planning a novel about the 1971 @entity170 , hopes the trip will help others ' gain an understanding of the challenges of reversing federal policy and returning people to their homes , even for a brief visit of several weeks '			0
reaching @entity0 is no easy feat. with no landing spot for a large boat , mrs @entity125 will have to use a helicopter or small boat to reach the village			2
she will also need a tent that can stay up as strong winds blow across the deserted settlement , which is about 90 miles from the gold rush town of @entity48			0
roots : poet @entity125 is organizing a trip to the remote @entity0 to connect with her heritage memories : the poet plans to document her trip to the remote island , to preserve the @entity78 culture connection : @entity125 holds a walrus ivory letter opener , carved by her grandfather who was one of the island 's last residents ms @entity125 plans to set up a website about the ghost town , and had campaigned to raise funds for her trip on the fundraising site @entity207			1
she had raised more than $ 15,000 through her online campaign , when the anonymous group made its $ 32,000 donation			0
' it is unusual for an anonymous gift to come in this large , ' @entity207 program officer @entity213 told @entity214			0
' but it 's not uncommon for foundations and corporations to give to projects			0

the tiny deserted @entity0 is 40 miles from the @entity7 mainland
for thousands of years , a small community lived on its rocky banks
but last century , men were shipped to @entity20 , others lost their lives to @entity228 and fears spread about rock slides - so the inhabitants moved away
now the granddaughter of former residents is hoping to visit the island
