the @entity1 rationing body is poised to ban the use of a drug that could delay the need for chemotherapy among men with advanced prostate cancer the @entity1 rationing body is poised to ban the use of a drug that could delay the need for chemotherapy among men with advanced prostate cancer			1
@entity11 , which gives at least four months ’ extra life , is offered to men on the @entity1 after treatment and when they are running out of options			1
the pill ’s manufacturer , @entity19 , and campaigners want thousands to receive earlier treatment before chemotherapy , but draft guidance from the @entity24 would ban this			2
last year , abiraterone was used before chemotherapy by 3,000 men in @entity29 through the @entity30 , which picks up the bill when a treatment is awaiting approval by @entity24			1
it was the second most requested treatment backed by the fund			0
doctors say the figures show the drug , which was developed by @entity40 scientists , is now more likely to be used before chemotherapy , and some men have survived on it for almost five years			2
sir @entity44 , chief executive of @entity24 , said the drug would not be cost - effective at this stage of treatment			1
a month ’s treatment costs £ 3,000 , but the @entity1 and the @entity30 pay less through a discount scheme			2
