an online children 's shop has sparked outrage by selling t - shirts that @entity5 users describe as ' sexist '			1
children 's clothing e-tailer @entity8 is offering t - shirts for little girls with slogans such as ' born to wear diamonds ' , but ones for young boys with statements such as ' superhero ' - and they have n't gone down well on the web			1

girls vs boys : these t - shirts sold on @entity8 have sparked outrage on the net because of their ' sexist ' slogans ' by contrast , their boys t - shirts are all about surfing and playing drums and being a superhero			2
' they 're by no means perfect , but they paint the picture of a pro-active kid putting himself out there and making things happen			0
if the company does n't want to mix all the shirts together - boys and girls basically have the same bodies at those ages , why ca n't they choose for themselves ? ' the t - shirts , which are priced at around Â£ 8 ( $ 12 ) each , also feature a girl 's top with a check - list that reads : ' my best subjects : shopping , music , dancing ' with a tick by each and then : ' math ( well , nobody 's perfect ) without a tick by it			0
offensive : the t - shirts have caused offence to web users , with one saying : ' when you start marketing garbage to little girls that 's all diamonds rule , math @entity27 , you 're officially a sh * * * company ' the boys range , however , features t - shirts saying : ' i was born to ride ' and ' winning runs in my family '			2
one user wrote on @entity81 : ' something that continually disturbs me about these articles involving sexist t - shirts for kids is that they all seem to be at lower end retailers - @entity88 's , the @entity8 , etc. ' i 'm not saying they 're okay anywhere or that they do n't exist everywhere , but it 's interesting to me that these are being directly sold to and affecting disproportionately girls on the lower socioeconomic end of the spectrum - the ones that are already statistically more likely to achieve lower education levels , get pregnant earlier , be victims of abuse , etc. ' whilst @entity5 users added comments such as ' another place not to shop ' , ' do n't worry if you 're not good at math # genderbias ' and ' more sexist crap for your kids '			1
the @entity110 - based company , that also sell children 's shoes , accessories and baby clothes , ship worldwide and have an outlet at @entity118			0
@entity8 has been contacted by @entity119 for a comment			0
different messages : one web user pointed out that the boy 's t - shirts paint the picture of an active kid putting himself out there but is less than impressed with the girl 's version all together : one @entity19 writer says the t - shirts should all be advertised together so children can choose what they want to wear , yet the site clearly markets them separately not happy : @entity5 users have given their opinion on the children 's t - shirts			1

web users believe online children 's shop is selling sexist t - shirts
girls t - shirts say ' born to wear diamonds ' and boys say : ' born to be a superhero '
@entity5 users call items ' sexist crap ' and ' gender bias '
