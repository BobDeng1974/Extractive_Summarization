by @entity0 nearly half a million women are being denied a 7p - a - day pill that could prevent breast cancer because of @entity5 red tape			1
those with a family history of the illness should be offered @entity9 or the similar drug @entity11 , which can cut their risk by 40 per cent			1
the medicines watchdog @entity13 urged doctors to offer the pills to high - and moderate - risk women for prevention last june			1
cheap cure : those with a family history of breast cancer should be offered @entity9 or the similar drug @entity11 , which can cut their risk by 40 per cent , and cost less than 7p per day the drugs cost less than 7p a day , and experts say giving them to at - risk patients will not only save lives , but millions of pounds in treatment costs for chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery			1
however , a year after doctors were told to start prescribing them , the drugs are yet to be licensed for use – despite the fact they are known to be safe			0
as a result , gps are unwilling to hand them out , fearing patients could sue over any side effects			0
doctors had been told to offer @entity9 or @entity11 to any women over 35 who have more than a 17 per cent risk of breast cancer based on their family history , compared with the average risk of 12.5 per cent			1
this amounts to about 488,000 women in @entity50 and @entity51 – the equivalent of 3 per cent of the entire age group			2
charities say they are ‘ deeply concerned ’ by the delay , which they fear could lead to women needlessly dying of breast cancer			1
taking action : conservative mp @entity60 is introducing a @entity61 urging health secretary @entity62 to grant new licences for the breast cancer drugs immediately @entity65 , head of policy at @entity67 , said : ‘ it ’s incomprehensible that there are low - cost , effective treatments out there which are not routinely available to patients because of red tape			1
' @entity75 is preventing potentially life - saving drugs from being made available to the thousands of women who could be eligible for them			0
‘ any delays could mean the difference between life and death for thousands of patients , and this is simply unacceptable			0
’ last year ’s guidelines were hailed by campaigners as a ‘ truly historic moment ’ and a ‘ tangible ’ way for women to drastically reduce their chances of getting the illness			0
taking too long : medicines watchdog @entity13 urged doctors to offer the pills to women with high - or moderate risk of breast cancer last june but 12 months later , the charity says there is no evidence the drugs are being used on any ‘ substantive scale ’			1
this is because the official medicine and @entity103 has still not licensed the drugs for the purpose @entity13 has already recommended them for			2
@entity67 added that such delays are also preventing a further 34,000 women with breast cancer being given a drug that could cut their chance of dying by 17 per cent			1
it wants all sufferers over 50 to be offered bisphosphonates , which cost less than 30p a day			0
they are routinely used to treat osteoporosis , but research has shown they also prevent breast cancer spreading to the bones			2
the charity is backed by @entity119 mp @entity60 , who is introducing a @entity120 ’ @entity121 urging health secretary @entity62 to grant new licences immediately			0
he also hopes it will also be used for other drugs which have been licensed for one condition , but have been shown to be effective at treating another			0
‘ it clearly makes sense to address this barrier to accessing drugs and i ’m delighted to have the opportunity to do so , ’ he said			0
around 50,500 women develop breast cancer in the @entity133 every year and it causes 11,500 deaths			2
of those diagnosed , around 2,400 patients have inherited faults in known breast cancer genes including @entity139 1 and 2			2
both @entity9 and @entity11 are licensed in the @entity140 to prevent breast cancer , and are taken by around 40,000 women – but researchers say this figure is still ‘ very low ’			1
the drugs work by blocking the hormone oestrogen , which is known to trigger the growth of cancerous cells			0
however , they can cause side effects such as hot flushes , headaches , nausea and , in rare cases , blood clots and strokes .			0
