gruesome : @entity6 prepares to chew on the baby rat during the sickening 45 - minute video clip all done : the 31 - year - old then opens his mouth to prove he has gobbled the entire hairless baby animal the 31 - year - old had been charged with aggravated animal abuse in april after police were alerted to the footage which had drawn complaints from horrified internet users			1
