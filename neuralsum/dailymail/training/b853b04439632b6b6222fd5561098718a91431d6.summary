a goal to repay his £ 3.25million fee in one go ? quite possibly			0
@entity3 brought a sparkle seldom seen at @entity5 with a wonderful strike to avert the danger of another exit to lower - league opposition for @entity10			1
the @entity11 marked his first @entity12 start following his move from @entity14 in a style @entity10 hoped , rather than expected			1
picking up the ball from @entity17 on the right , he drove at @entity19 , cut inside and waved his left - foot like a wand to send the ball arcing beautifully into the far corner			0
a moment to get the @entity12 fans off their seats , a moment that gave hope for the future			1
this was only their second goal in more than 11 hours of play but @entity3 is a player alright , his strike the high point of an appearance full of promise			1
@entity12 january signing @entity3 celebrates scoring his side 's opening goal @entity40 attacking midfielder @entity3 is all smiles after scoring his first goal for @entity12 since his recent move all of @entity12 's outfield players celebrate @entity3 's @entity46 fourth round goal against @entity48 side @entity47 @entity49 doubled his side 's lead to ensure @entity12 progressed to the fifth round of the @entity46 @entity12 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : given 6.5 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 5 , @entity58 6 ; @entity59 5 ( @entity60 90 ) , @entity3 7.5 ( @entity61 87 ) , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity17 5 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goals : @entity3 51 , @entity49 71 booked : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity59 manager : @entity10 7 @entity47 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : camp 6 ; @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 6 , @entity19 6 ( @entity73 60 , 5 ) ; @entity74 7 ; @entity75 6.5 ( @entity76 79 ) , @entity77 6.5 , @entity78 7 , @entity79 6.5 ; @entity80 6 ( @entity81 60 , 6.5 ) subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 goal : @entity81 90 manager : @entity89 6.5 attendance : 27,415 referee : @entity92 7 @entity93 : @entity3 @entity49 added a second goal that ultimately proved the winner when @entity81 struck in added time for the visitors			1
it was only the third time this season @entity12 have scored more than once in a game			1
so an upset of sorts			0
it is @entity3 ’s contribution , however , that will live in the memory			1
@entity5 was given a much - needed lift 10 minutes before kick - off with the announcement that @entity107 had signed a new four - and - a - half year contract			0
the @entity110 midfielder addressed the crowd via a video over the big screens , but his words were largely inaudible and it needed the stadium announcer to clarify the positive news			0
@entity107 was absent from the @entity12 line - up , which featured six changes to @entity10 ’s last selection			1
@entity3 was handed his full debut , and @entity55 returned from suspension to captain the side			1
@entity125 , @entity56 and @entity59 were the trio who could not be classed as regular starters			0
@entity89 stuck to his usual pattern and made wholesale changes – eight from the team that lost to @entity130 in midweek			0
@entity71 and @entity72 retained their places , as did @entity78			0
he was instrumental in @entity47 performing better than the @entity134 side throughout the first half			1
@entity78 ’s movement and passing – operating in front of @entity12 the defence – appeared an illustration of what @entity10 ’s team have lacked during their barren scoring run			2
@entity12 failed to register a shot on target in the opening period – but should have done after nine minutes			2
@entity49 timed his run to meet @entity53 ’s cross from the right without breaking stride but sent his header wide as the home fans readied themselves for a cathartic release of noise			2
from then , it was @entity89 ’s @entity48 leaders who fashioned the better opportunities			0
@entity78 put through @entity77 with a one - touch pass and the @entity47 midfielder rounded given to send a shot towards goal			1
@entity56 recovered to clear near the line			0
in the 32nd minute @entity74 struck from range requiring a tip wide from given at full - stretch and then @entity78 saw a shot deflected into the side - netting			0
@entity74 tried again , this time sending a curling effort just over			0
@entity12 's new no 25 runs to celebrate in front of the @entity5 faithful @entity47 goalkeeper @entity171 fails to stop @entity49 's shot from hitting the back of the net shortly before half - time @entity74 fed @entity80 but as the striker bore down on goal to pull the trigger @entity54 performed an excellent sliding tackle			1
@entity17 was continuing to perform with little gusto and boos from the @entity5 greeted the interval whistle			0
the stage seemed set for another exit to lower league opposition			0
but up stepped @entity3 to produce a different kind of @entity46 magic			2
@entity10 wheeled around in celebration that his january signing had paid immediate dividends			0
turns out @entity12 scoring was this game ’s @entity46 shock , and the surprise was doubled with another lovely goal 19 minutes from the end			1
@entity59 picked out @entity53 ’s run down the right and the @entity197 pulled back a first - time cross to @entity49 , who applied a cushion finish into the far corner			2
@entity47 found the net in injury time , when @entity70 pulled back a cross for substitute @entity204 to convert			2
could the @entity205 do a @entity206 ? no. as they pushed for an unlikely equaliser , @entity12 mounted a counter-attack that saw @entity17 feed substitute @entity61 whose shot was heading in until @entity171 stretched a hand			2
@entity12 advance , and all of a sudden find themselves with an opportunity to find a silver lining from this most gloomy of seasons			2
cherries striker @entity81 wheels away in celebration after scoring in the closing stages of his side 's @entity46 encounter @entity17 looks dejected after his side squandered an opportunity against the @entity205 there were plenty of empty seats at @entity5 as fans of the @entity134 outfit decided against seeing their side in action @entity12 announced the news of @entity107 signing a new four - and - a - half year contract on their big screen @entity3 runs at @entity47 's @entity78 as he attempts to bring the ball forward for his side @entity47 manager @entity89 barks out instructions to his side during the @entity46 clash @entity239 of @entity47 sports a bandage on his head during his side 's 2 - 1 defeat against @entity12 @entity10 congratulates goalscorer @entity3 after taking the @entity11 off in the 87th minute @entity12 and @entity47 players shake hands after the final whistle , while @entity3 ( right ) looks in buoyant mood @entity89 applauds @entity47 's travelling supporters after the final whistle at @entity5			1
