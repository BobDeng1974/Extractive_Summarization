two daredevils trying to scale a dangerous rock face in @entity2 without climbing gear are due to reach the end of their 3,000ft journey tonight			1
@entity6 , 36 , and @entity7 , 30 , have been working their way up the sheer face of @entity10 since december 27 - and their only concession to modern climbing techniques are ropes to catch them should they fall			1
they started climbing the final 11 sections - known as pitches - on the rock face tuesday night , and are expected to close on the summit by wednesday evening , a spokesman said			1
ropes are attached to stop them falling - but they have no climbing aids to get them up the rock face struggle : the men have spent weeks climbing the @entity31 peak , which has only razor - thing ledges to grip which have eviscerated their hands struggle : the two men have been climbing the @entity10 rock face for some three weeks now			1
pictured above is @entity7 on january 9 reaching for one of the @entity40 formation 's many sharp , narrow ledges triumph : @entity7 is pictured here after finishing a particularly grueling segment of the dangerous wall			2
neither he nor partner @entity6 use climbing aids to scale the mountain - but both are attached by ropes to save them should they slip home for now : the men are sleeping in tents pegged to the face of @entity10 and ascend every day to where they left off their endeavor will be the first ever ' free climb ' the segment known as @entity57			1
the two men , who sleep in tents pegged to the side of the rock face , have struggled for days to reach the final stretch			0
@entity7 has recently started out again after tearing the skin from his hands on @entity10 's razor - sharp ledges , which forced him to spend two days resting so he could heal			1
on tuesday night the spokesman said : ' we will update you on their progress this evening as best we can , but it is likely that they will finish up the climb tomorrow evening			2
' the men often start climbing at dusk , because the heat of the day can make their hands sweaty and slippery			2
both of them have been training for more than five years to make their bid for the summit			0
the climbers have been keeping their fans updated intermittently on social media			0
earlier this week , after finally finishing a segment from which he had fallen 11 times in seven days , making no progress , @entity7 said : ' momentum is a powerful force			0
when it 's on your side , everything feels a bit easier			0
when it 's not on your side , it feels like wading through mud			0
' for 7 days , my momentum was halted by @entity99			0
it took everything in my power to stay positive and resolved that i would succeed			0
long way down : @entity6 , pictured examining his sore hands , has been climbing with his buddy since december 27 sheer wall : the rock face offers little in the way of support , and what ledges there are can slice up the hands of the climbers ' now that momentum has returned to my side , i 'm staying just as focused and resolved because a lot of hard climbing remains			1
' the day before @entity6 , who had made faster progress than his climbing mate , posted in support of @entity7			1
he said : ' today @entity7 managed to climb pitch 15 in the most inspired climbing moment of his life			1
' it was such an intense and incredible thing to witness			0
it 's not over yet , but things are looking good			0
intense : the men have been living in the @entity31 national park while attempting the feat			2

@entity6 and @entity7 have been climbing since late december - nearly three weeks
attempting first unaided climb of 3,000ft @entity10 in @entity2 , @entity31
spokesman said that they are expected to triumph wednesday evening
the men use no climbing aids - but are attached by ropes in case they fall
