by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 2 august 2013 a tycoon who turned an ancient woodland into a wasteland has been ordered to pay almost £ 1million			1
@entity4 , who is said to be as wealthy as the @entity5 , allowed workmen to decimate the beauty spot so a vehicle track could be built to his pheasant shoot			1
a huge swathe was cut through picturesque @entity11 in @entity12 , flattening trees , churning up soil and disturbing wildlife			1
wasteland : @entity4 , whose £ 300million estimated fortune ranks him 277th in the @entity19 , admitted two counts of damaging @entity11 , a 72 - acre @entity21 in @entity12 tycoon : @entity4 , 47 , who lives at @entity23 in @entity12 , owns the @entity25 chain and is said to be as wealthy as the @entity5 , allowed trees to be felled on land where he has the shoot heritage : the court heard @entity11 is one of the county 's finest conservation sites , featuring birch , oak , and alder trees , damp sandstone outcrops where mosses and liverworts thrive before the illegal felling , the area was sheltered by birch and oak trees			1
mosses and liverworts grew on sandstone outcrops and birds such as pied flycatchers , redstarts and wood warblers thrived			2
but by the time mr day ’s workmen had finished , the landscape – which provided stones for @entity50 – was a scarred scene of destruction			2
the 47 - year - old , who owns the @entity25 chain and is worth around £ 300million , told a court he did not know the work was to be carried out and had not authorised it			1
@entity50 , which stretches across northern @entity59 , was built in 122 ad on the orders of the roman emperor @entity61 to mark his empire 's northern frontier			0
it took eight years to build the 73 mile - long wall from the @entity66 to @entity67 on the @entity68			0
it is believed to have provided a barrier between @entity71 and @entity72 and is thought to have been where the army could determine who was allowed access to the empire			1
it remained in use until the early fifth century when , with the empire collapsing and the city of @entity83 itself under threat , the @entity80 left @entity87 shores			0
it is the largest monument from the ancient era in northern @entity90 and is a @entity91			2
but because he had allowed it to happen at the site of special scientific interest , he pleaded guilty to two charges of letting unauthorised work be carried out			1
he was fined £ 450,000 and ordered to pay legal costs of £ 457,000 when he appeared at @entity98			0
judge @entity99 said the multi-millionaire had been ‘ grossly negligent ’ over the work , which severely damaged protected flora in the ancient woodland			1
judge @entity104 also criticised the businessman ’s defence for ‘ seeking to use the power of his wealth to avoid responsibility ’ and which had rebounded to his ‘ lasting disgrace ’			0
day , whose fortune ranks him at 277th in the @entity19 , lives at @entity23 , a 19th century mansion near the @entity116 market town of @entity117			2
the son of a newsagent , he is a self - made man who grew up on a @entity122 council estate			0
he has previously been criticised for his handling of the 72 - acre woods , which he bought in 2010			0
he angered townsfolk when he told a parish council meeting that , while 6,500 young pheasants had been released into the wood ready for shooting , 12,000 would be more appropriate for an area of that size			0
he also said : ‘ we do n’t have to come up with replanting schemes if we do n’t want to			0
we own the woods , we can please ourselves			0
’ impressive residence : @entity135 , @entity4 's home at @entity23 , a 19th century @entity137 - style country pile near the small market town of @entity117 , is just a mile away locals complained on internet forums about the woodlands being destroyed			1
one wrote : ‘ i have seen these woods turned from their beautiful appearance , to what can be described as a farm			0
‘ heavy machinery , no less than four diggers , three tractors and a host of 4x4s have been driven around the wood			0
’ the court was told that in november 2010 , trees were felled and land was excavated to make a ‘ significant ’ track			1
in his defence , @entity157 , said @entity4 had neither known about nor authorised the work , and the prosecution had accepted this			1
the court also heard @entity4 had already begun to repair the damage			1
famous structure : the cliffs at @entity11 still bear the marks of @entity71 stonemasons who worked during the building of @entity50 ( pictured ) in around @entity170 the judge – who took court officials and legal teams to the woods to examine the scene – said the fine had to reflect legitimate public concern about the protection of conservation areas			1
after the hearing , @entity180 , of @entity181 , which brought the prosecution against day , said : ‘ legal action is always regrettable , and we were disappointed that a woodland of such ecological importance , and one that is very special to the local community , was so severely damaged			1
’ a spokesman for @entity4 said after the hearing : ' as acknowledged by the judge in this case , @entity4 did not deliberately set out to damage a @entity21			2
' mr @entity4 is passionate about the countryside and committed to conservation			2
he was shocked to find that damage had been caused to the site by contractors			0
' as soon as he became aware of this , he worked closely with @entity181 to carry out a full restoration programme , which was completed over two years ago			0
' mr @entity4 intends to appeal against the sentence			2
the fine is nine times the amount imposed for previous similar offences			0
