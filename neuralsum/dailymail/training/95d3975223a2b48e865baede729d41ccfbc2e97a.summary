@entity5 was told he was an ' old , aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth ' by the director of a window and conservatory firm , who sent the note after meeting with him about a job opening			1
in the email , @entity13 , from @entity14 , also claimed mr @entity5 was ' one of the most irritating , rude , obnoxious and arrogant people ' she had ever had the ' misfortune ' to meet			1
cutting : the email , pictured , from @entity13 at @entity14 , also claimed @entity19 was ' one of the most irritating , rude , obnoxious and arrogant people ' she had ever had the ' misfortune ' to meet ms @entity13 said the ' therapeutic rant ' was sent by mistake and that she had written a second , more professionally - worded one that was intended for mr @entity5			1
mr @entity5 , a former serviceman , met with ms @entity13 for an informal conversation about an opening for a self - employed labourer at the company , based in @entity29 , @entity30			1
he claims he thought their initial meeting had gone well and that ms @entity13 had agreed to get in touch later that day			1
when he heard nothing back , mr @entity5 sent her an email saying : ' just a quick email to say that you promised to phone me today			1
i rang your mobile but you did not answer			0
i sent a text you did not answer			0
when you promise something you carry it through			0
' he then received the e-mail , which contained several expletives			0
@entity49 interview : mr @entity5 , a former serviceman , met with ms @entity13 for an informal conversation about an opening for a self - employed labourer at the @entity14 , pictured , based in @entity29 , @entity30 one line in the message read : ' i only wish i 'd have seen your cv beforehand , to save us both the time , as i would have probably noticed your main job role as professional p * * * *			1
' the 48 - year - old , from @entity63 , @entity30 , said his confidence had been knocked by the personal attack			1
he said : ' there 's no way as a professional , and especially as a director of a company , that you would treat somebody that way			2
i really did n't expect something as nasty as that			0
' @entity5 , sincere apologies for not replying to you today , as it happens i actually have a job , and other things to do with my day other than reply to you , when i had already had the misfortune of wasting 30 very long minutes of my life speaking to ; not only the most inappropriate person for this job role , but probably for any role , you will spend the next few years applying for , only to get rejected as soon as they meet you			1
you are without doubt one of the most irritating , rude , obnoxious and arrogant people i have had the misfortune to meet , and your email just solidifies this			2
also , for an old aesthetically challenged guy with no teeth you have an unbelievable amount of confidence ! so you say , you did n't notice the word ' professional ' on our website ... belive me , if i had been anything other than ' professional ' , i would have told you what i was actually thinking which was ' this guy is an absolute * * * * , get the * * * * out '			2
but no , alas , i stayed ' professional '			2
i only wish i 'd have seen your cv beforehand , to save us both the time , as i would have probably noticed your main job role as ' professional p * * * * '			2
good luck for the future @entity13 ms @entity13 admitted she had sent the wrong email , but defended its message , saying she had been left ' genuinely shocked ' by mr @entity5 's behaviour , claiming he was ' belittling and offensive '			1
she said : ' ironically , i had read something that day which said if you are angry or upset you should write it down and get it all out to move on			0
' so that evening at home i did this			0
i then wrote another email reply to @entity5			2
' unfortunately , i now realise that it was in fact the other email which was sent in error , which was never supposed to be seen by him			0
' i must stress this was my personal opinion , and not the opinion of the company , and the email written , although sent in error , was in retaliation to a person insulting me			2
' ms @entity13 claims the meeting with @entity5 was not an official interview as they were looking for a self - employed labourer to help carry out basic tasks such as carrying materials and dig holes			1
she added : ' @entity5 was so unbelievably rude , inappropriate and insulting , towards me personally and also the company			1
' i actually thought it was a joke			0
i was waiting for the hidden camera crew to jump out and say " ha , got ya "			0
' i was genuinely shocked , hurt and angered by his behaviour and attitude , and the things he said			0
' we have worked very hard to build this family business up and when someone is insulting the business it does feel like they are hurting a member of your family			0
' he was derogatory , belittling and offensive and i felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time he was there			0
when he left i politely said ' thanks , i 'll give you a ring to let you know '			0
' that evening , a few hours later on the same day he came in , he sent an email , which was also rude , insulting and harassing			2
' @entity5 had therefore rejected the self - employed role in this email , so he was not looking for feedback			1
he said he was not interested			0

@entity5 met with boss of window firm for informal meeting about job
the 48 - year - old was later sent cutting email by director @entity13
but ms @entity13 defended her note , saying mr @entity5 was ' rude and insulting '
