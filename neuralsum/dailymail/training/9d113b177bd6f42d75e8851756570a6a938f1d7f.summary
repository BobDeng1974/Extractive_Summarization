there is another fight of significance for @entity4 boxing taking place here this saturday night			2
@entity6 will be the star attraction as he battles @entity8 at the @entity9			1
but meanwhile , just a stroll down the @entity13 at the @entity14 , @entity11 ’s @entity10 will be taking on @entity15 for the vacant @entity17 middleweight title			1
not only is his big chance coming , at just 25 , but if @entity10 prevails he will beat both @entity36 and @entity37 in the race to become the first member of the travelling community to win a world title			1
even so , @entity36 will be rooting for @entity10 : ‘ we ’re mates and i wo n’t be jealous if he pulls it off			1
i will be delighted for him			0
and if he does come through it will make for a massive domestic fight for us next year			0
’ @entity10 , whose only previous world title shot ended in defeat @entity50 , is again the underdog			2
@entity15 enjoyed a stellar amateur career , winning multiple world titles			2
but it has taken the talented @entity57 time to adapt to the professional ring			0
@entity10 remained on course for a world title shot with a stunning knockout of @entity62 in june @entity25 ( right ) will face the winner after his victory over @entity27 ( left ) last month however he seems to have settled into the paid ranks now and is a heavy betting favourite to see off @entity10			1
@entity36 sees it rather differently , believing @entity15 would be the easier opponent and saying : ‘ i think his style would suit me perfectly			1
he ’s good but the way to beat him is to keep him busy , keep the pressure on , wear him down – and that ’s what he will get from me if we meet			0
‘ with @entity10 you have to bring your a-game or you ’ll be in trouble			0
he will be dangerous in the first few rounds			0
’ nevertheless , he slightly favours @entity15 to prevail , saying : ‘ i keep wavering between the two but in the end i think @entity15 will edge it on points			0
’ @entity15 v @entity10 will be televised live on @entity32 from 2am sunday morning .			2
