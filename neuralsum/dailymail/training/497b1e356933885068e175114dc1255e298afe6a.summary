no sooner had @entity3 striker @entity2 condemned @entity1 's @entity0 hopes than the internet does what it does best - come up with virals about the match			1
@entity2 , unsurprisingly , was the subject of many of them following his double in @entity3 's 2 - 1 victory , with some depicting him as @entity13 , others highlighting his miraculous recovery and one even seemingly looking like he has the @entity16 in a headlock			0
others included a dig at @entity20 , thought by some to be at fault for @entity3 's second goal , a focus on a @entity25 fan in the @entity3 end and the @entity16 seemingly looking for revenge			0

@entity2 scored two goals against @entity1 for @entity3 in what was a vital @entity0 clash for both nations
a number of @entity2 images have since gone viral online and on *social* media
