by @entity0 published : 16:24 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 7 june 2013 @entity1 will require doctors to collect umbilical cord blood from babies born to some young mothers , under a new law intended to identify statutory rapists and reduce the state 's rate of teenage pregnancy , the highest in the country			1
the measure , which takes effect on july 1 and is the first of its kind in the country , targets certain mothers who were 16 or younger at the time of conception			2
under the law , doctors and midwives will be expected to retrieve umbilical cord blood in cases where the father is 21 or older or when the baby 's paternity is in question			1
samples will be stored at the state medical examiner 's office for testing in the event that police believe the girl was the victim of statutory rape			1
but they will not automatically be entered into the state 's criminal dna database			0
new law : doctors and midwives in the state will be required by law to collect samples of umbilical cord blood from babies born to some girls under the age of 16 supporters of the law say it offers an important new tool to prevent older men from having sex with younger girls			1
critics argue , however , that it violates privacy and will do little to deter teen pregnancy			1
' we think it 's a very invasive law to a woman who is already in a vulnerable situation , ' said @entity64 , executive director of the women 's fund of @entity1 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to women 's rights			1
@entity1 leads the nation in teen live - birth rates with 55 out of 1,000 babies born to young women between the ages of 15 and 19 , according to 2010 data from the @entity74			1
the national average was 34.2 live births per 1,000 population and the lowest was 15.7 , in @entity78 , the @entity74 reported			0
governor @entity79 said , ' as governor , i am serious about confronting and reducing teen pregnancy in @entity1			1
unfortunately , part of this epidemic is driven by sexual offenders who prey on young girls			0
this measure provides law enforcement with another tool to help identify these men and bring them to justice			2
' first in the nation : officials will analyze the samples and try to identify the fathers through matches in the state 's dna database @entity1 is the first state to pass such a law , said the bill 's author , @entity101 state representative @entity100			1
the state will pay for the costs of the collection and testing of cord blood , @entity100 said , adding that testing will be conducted as needed as part of criminal proceedings			0
an estimate of those costs was not yet available			0
@entity79 also championed a 2012 state law requiring doctors to preserve fetal tissue in abortions involving girls under 14 if they suspect the pregnancy resulted from a sex crime against a minor			2
the latest measure puts @entity1 in uncharted territory and opens it to legal challenges , according to @entity124 , a constitutional law professor at @entity125			2
' the argument is that the @entity97 is abandoned or about to be abandoned as medical waste , and a person does n't have constitutional privacy over trash , ' he said			0
' but i think people are understandably nervous about the government collecting and permanently storing information from their dna			0
' @entity124 said the law puts doctors in the awkward position of acting as law enforcement officers			0
the state medical association successfully pushed for a penalty exemption for doctors who do not comply in good faith			0
' physicians would rather the @entity143 supervise and regulate the practice of medicine instead of having government intrusion between doctors and patients , ' said @entity150 , immediate past president of the @entity151			0
@entity64 said the state would be better off pursuing proven teen pregnancy prevention methods , such as comprehensive sex education and access to confidential health services			1
@entity1 requires public schools to teach sex education , but the instruction is limited to either an abstinence - only or abstinence - plus curriculum , which critics say is not comprehensive enough .			2

law gives officials another tool to determine the fathers of children born to women under age 16
requires doctors to take blood samples from umbilical cords born to those women when father is older than 21 or paternity is *uncertain*
@entity178 is first of its kind in the @entity180 and is intended to identify statutory rapists and cut @entity1 's teen pregnancy rate
