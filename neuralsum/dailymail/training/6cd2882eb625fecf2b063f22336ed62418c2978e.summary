by @entity0 the @entity3 government spied on major human rights groups such as @entity5 and @entity6 , the whistleblower @entity1 has claimed			1
he told @entity8 's largest human rights watchdog that the @entity9 had ' specifically targeted either leaders or staff members ' in a large number of groups			1
mr @entity1 's evidence - via video link from @entity16 , where he has been in hiding since last year - came as he mocked claims he had taken 1.7million documents as a ' scare number ' with no meaning			1
allegations : @entity1 appeared before the @entity22 via video link from @entity16 mr @entity1 said ' trillions ' of private communications were monitored , including those of human rights groups the @entity9 whistleblower spoke for more than an hour to the @entity22 , a human rights group with 47 member states			1
he defended his decision to leak thousands of documents , saying : ' my motivation is to improve government , not to bring it down			0
' despite the changes which had been made because of his revelations , he said : ' i remain in a position of significant legal jeaopardy '			0
he was then asked if the @entity3 had tracked ' highly sensitive and confidential communications ' of groups including - but not limited to - @entity5 and @entity6			1
he told council members : ' without question - yes , absolutely they do			2
' the @entity9 has in fact specifically targeted the communications of either leaders or staff members in a number of purely civil or human rights organisations of the kind described in the question , including domestically within the borders of the @entity3			1
' in an interview before the hearing , the whistleblower - whose first claims emerged in june last year - said @entity3 officials were exaggerating when they said he stole 1.7million documents			1
hearing : the hour - long session was a rare public appearance for mr @entity1 , who is hiding in @entity16 interview : mr @entity1 's evidence - via video link from @entity16 , where he has been in hiding for almost a year - came as he mocked claims he had taken 1.7million documents as a ' scare number ' with no meaning watchdog : the @entity22 is a separate body from the @entity67 and includes 47 member states he told @entity71 magazine it was ' simply a scare number based on an intentionally crude metric - everything that i ever digitally interacted with in my career			1
' he added : ' every single one of those officials knows i do n’t have 1.7million files , but what are they going to say ? ' what senior official is going to go in front of @entity83 and say , " we have no idea what he has , because the @entity9 ’s auditing of systems holding hundreds of millions of @entity3 ’ data is so negligent that any high - school dropout can walk out the door with it ? " ' ' the @entity9 ’s auditing of systems holding hundreds of millions of @entity3 ’ data is so negligent that any high - school dropout can walk out the door with it ' - @entity1 , in @entity71 interview mr @entity1 , 30 , left his job as an @entity9 contractor and fled to @entity101 before his revelations on mass surveillance were first published last summer			1
when charges were filed against him he left @entity101 for @entity16 , where he was trapped in the @entity107 capital 's airport for more than a month before being granted temporary asylum			0
yesterday 's hearing in @entity110 saw several council members criticise @entity3 tactics and call for an end to indiscriminate data collection			2
it came on the day the @entity116 struck down @entity67 data protection rules , saying they caused ' particularly serious interference ' with the right to a personal life and personal data			0
in his evidence mr @entity1 also criticised the @entity125 spy agency @entity124 , and reminded members the @entity9 collected countless explicit images - including from webcams			2
he said ' trillions ' of communications were intercepted , adding : ' the vast majority had no intelligence value at all and roughly 10 per cent of images were intensely private , depicting nudity or other intimacy			0
' anger : several members of the council used the platform to condemn mass surveillance by the @entity3 authoritarian : mr @entity1 warned regimes could compile , for example , a list of ' all the @entity143 in @entity144 ' people 's sexual orientation was already being collected without their knowledge , with horrific potential consequences if an authoritarian regime obtained the same technology			1
he gave the example of making a list of ' all the @entity143 in @entity144 '			1
the court in the @entity3 which approved data access was held in secret and was unaccountable to the public , he added			2
' human rights can only be protected if we ensure that our laws have a clear meaning and the meaning of the words within those laws can not be secretly interpreted by any legal body or intelligence agency without the public 's consent , ' he said			0
@entity169 centre - right mp @entity168 told @entity170 : ' the @entity3 is always saying they want to protect human rights defenders			1
but if they have a special program to eavesdrop on @entity5 or the @entity175 , there might be a potential problem			2
' the council invited the @entity178 to give evidence , but it declined			0
a senior judge has launched an investigation into how @entity125 's police and spy agencies access citizens ' private information			2
interception of communications commissioner @entity187 launched the investigation after finding @entity125 authorities were given permission to access phone records and e-mails more than half a million times last year			0
he said he had also studied mr @entity1 's claims , but found no evidence of ' indiscriminate mass intrusion '			0
however , he added : ' it seems to me to be a very large number			0
it has the feel of being too many			0
' my office is in the process of undertaking an inquiry into whether there might be an institutional overuse of authorisations to acquire communications data			0
' a @entity208 spokesman said the review was welcome but stressed : ' communications data has played a significant role in every major security service counter-terrorist operation over the last decade , and is used in 95 percent of all serious and organised crime investigations			0

he told @entity22 they included @entity5 and @entity6
@entity9 ' targeted leaders or staff ' of several groups in the @entity3 and beyond
