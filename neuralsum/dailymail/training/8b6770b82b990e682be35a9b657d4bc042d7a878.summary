an overweight @entity0 has been put on an intensive weight loss regime after gorging on chicken dinners led to him ballooning to more than nine stone			1
@entity5 shocked staff at the @entity7 when they discovered he tipped the scales at just under 60kg - 9st 5lbs - which is double what he should weigh			1
@entity5 , who is just three - years - old , has now been placed on a strict calorie - controlled diet and it is hoped his strained joints will get some help from the centre 's hydrotherapy pool - once he can fit into it			2
obese : @entity18 tips the scales at a staggering 60kg - 9st 5lbs - which is double what he should weigh weighing in : a stunned vet at the @entity7 in @entity23 , @entity24 , puts @entity5 on the scales staff at the re-homing centre in @entity23 , @entity24 , are currently taking @entity5 - who weighs more than famous singers @entity27 and @entity29 - for three short walks a day			1
@entity5 can currently only walk around 100 metres before getting out of breath			2
but staff hope this will improve as he loses weight			2
the 41 - week plan is aimed at helping him lose one per cent of his body weight a week before reaching an initial target weight of 35kg			1
it is hoped @entity5 - who currently weighs the same as 150 tins of dog food - can eventually slim down to around 30 - 32kg which is a healthy size for a @entity0			1
the @entity0 , whose elderly owner recently passed away , is joined at the centre by his brother @entity46 , who weighs 44kg , but they have to be fed their restricted calorie dog food separately in case @entity5 helps himself to his brother 's			1
unhealthy : @entity5 's shocking weight - which is around the same as 150 tins of dog food - is putting strain on his joints and organs hard work : @entity5 can only walk around 100 metres before he gets out of breath and needs a rest @entity59 , @entity60 : ' @entity5 is the largest dog we have had at @entity63			2
' his diet had basically been full chicken dinners and other human - based food			0
he will eat pretty much anything			0
' but we know that with some attention and a very strict diet we can help him shed those pounds			2
' he now eats two small meals of restricted calorie dog food a day and we take him for three short walks			0
' we are hoping hydrotherapy will help him lose some weight a little bit quicker by releasing some of the strain on his joint , but unfortunately he â€™s too large for the tank at the moment			0
' calorie counting : @entity5 , pictured with @entity7 staff member @entity81 , has now been placed on a 41 - week plan with a strict calorie controlled diet to help him lose the weight contrasting physiques : @entity87 , who weighs nearly 60kg , looks significantly larger than black @entity88 , pictured left , who weighs a healthy 24kg at @entity91 in @entity23 she added : ' he is such a loveable dog			1
none of us have seen a dog so overweight			0
he wants to play with everyone so we feel sorry for him that he ca n't yet			0
' his plight highlights the danger of over-feeding your pet and even worse feeding them a human diet			0
' what is fine for us to eat is not for them , especially when combined with very little exercise			0
' once @entity5 is re-homed - the new owners will need to have room for both @entity5 and @entity46 - he will return to @entity63 for weigh - ins every two weeks to make sure he 's still on the right track			1
paws for thought : @entity116 director @entity115 hopes @entity5 's case will show other dog owners how it important it is to feed their pet appropriate food looking for a new home : when @entity5 is a healthy weight the @entity7 will help him find a new home with his brother @entity46 who weighs 44kg @entity116 director @entity115 said : ' the concern with @entity5 is the strain this excess weight is putting on his body , particularly his heart and joints			1
' human food is not an ideal balanced diet for your dog			0
' treats and special meals should be dog friendly , occasional and certainly not a replacement for his regular diet			0
' such treats are often highly calorific so if you are giving to your dog , reduce his daily meal portions accordingly			0
' information on @entity5 and other dogs at @entity23 can be found at www.dogstrust.org.uk or they are on @entity147 at @ @entity148			2
keeping on track : once he has been re-homed , @entity5 will continue to visit the @entity7 in @entity23 every two weeks for weigh - ins to make sure he stays a healthy weight			1
