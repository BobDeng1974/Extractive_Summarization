rape victim : @entity12 , who was pardoned by the @entity1 president earlier this month , with her daughter in a @entity15 jail			1
she was today released she was initially sentenced to two years in jail , but which was incredibly increased to 12 on appeal			2
a first release offer , which she eventually agreed to , staggeringly stipulated she must marry her attacker			2
but her lawyer , @entity31 , today said her new found freedom did not actually depend on her going through with the ceremony			2
it is now not known whether she intents to proceed with the ritual , which may also see her rapist freed , to restore the honour of her family			1
her lawyer confirmed to the @entity40 today , however , that she did have a ' safe place ' to go , which suggests she may not			1
@entity12 's case attracted international attention after she took part in a documentary film commissioned by the @entity46			1
its release was later halted			2
hidden : it is not known whether @entity12 , who was found guilty of adultery , will now actually marry her attacker to restore her family 's honour @entity31 said she hoped her client would be released shortly , and that there was a place for her in a women 's shelter			1
the palace statement said justice minister @entity57 asked a panel of top legal officials to order her release			2
the film in which @entity12 featured , a documentary on women in prison , was blocked from release by the @entity46 mission in @entity1			1
they feared it might compromise the safety of the women involved because it showed their identity			0
the film - makers have been pushing for the film to be released , and say @entity12 wanted her story to be told			1
film director @entity74 said : ' i made a promise to these women that i would get their stories out			0
i am glad that i 've been able to honour that promise to @entity12			1
' i still hope that our film can be released , so people can hear the stories of the other women , and perhaps increase their chance of getting justice as well			0
' @entity46 spokeswoman @entity86 welcomed news @entity12 would be freed but declined to comment on whether the film would be released			1
@entity12 's case had been condemned widely by human rights groups			1
an online petition started by @entity31 has been signed by more than 6,000 people			0
@entity31 said she is still trying to ascertain whether the attacker will also be released if they agree to marry			0
' after assessing @entity12 's case , ( they ) decided that her remaining sentence in jail should be pardoned under the current rules and regulations of the country and she should be released , ' the palace statement said			1
@entity12 was initially sentenced to two years in jail , which was later increased to 12 years on appeal			1
she was given the choice of marriage or serving a jail sentence			2
her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal , and the requirement for her to marry was dropped			0
@entity12 became pregnant as a result of the attack and gave birth to a daughter in the @entity14 women 's prison in @entity15 almost a year ago			1
earlier this week , she spoke of her ordeal and the day that started her long nightmare			0

she told @entity123 : ' he had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work			0
he closed doors and windows			0
i started screaming , but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth			0
' and the network also tracked down @entity12 's rapist , who denied attacking her , but said she would be a likely target if she got out of jail			1
he insisted that it would be her family , not his , that may kill her because of the dishonour			2
@entity31 also welcomed what she said was a decision to review the cases of other women in the same jail			0
she said : ' the judiciary has effectively supported the elimination of @entity148 by allowing for her to be released , for allowing for her to be pardoned			0
' precedent definitely has been set			0
as i understand it , the judiciary today was also reviewing the files of other women in @entity14			0
' the presidential palace declined to comment on whether other cases were under review .			0

@entity12 's lawyer says not legally *bound* to marriage
