@entity0 famously once said that if a company makes a stylus for a tablet , then ' they blew it '			2
so , the late @entity6 co-founder would n't have been impressed with the latest plans for the firm 's so - called super tablet - the @entity10 an analyst believes that , following a wave of @entity6 patents hinting at a smart pen , the firm could launch a stylus by the second quarter of this year			1
an analyst believes that following a wave of @entity6 patents ( example pictured ) over the past five years , which each referenced a stylus - style device , the firm could finally launch the pen by the second quarter of this year			1
the claims were made by @entity26 of @entity27 to @entity28 the claims were made by @entity26 from @entity27 to @entity28			1
' a stylus can be more convenient to use than the combination of keyboard and mouse in some cases , ' said mr @entity26			1
' therefore , we believe @entity6 's stylus will improve the user experience of 12.9 - inch @entity10			1
' @entity6 ’s @entity40 platform originally came with a stylus when it launched in the 1990s			1
and the trend took off with the launch of the palmpilot			2
but , at the 2008 @entity46 event , @entity0 slated the stylus			2
he said : ' who wants a stylus ? you have to get ‘ em , put ‘ em away , you lose ‘ em , yuck			2
' he added : ' so let 's not use a stylus			2
' we 're going to use the best pointing device in the world			0
' we 're going to use a pointing device that we 're all born with - born with ten of them			0
we 're going to use our fingers			0
we 're going to touch [ the @entity62 ] with our fingers			0
' he later said that any company that uses a stylus for a tablet had ' blown it			0
' recent patents include ' @entity69 ' , awarded in march 2014 , and ' @entity70 ' in january 2010			1
in fact , @entity6 has filed more than 22 separate patents for a smart pen , dubbed @entity74			1
last february , one patent in particular featured detachable modules including a camera , audio recorder , laser pointer , power source and more			0
other functions detailed in the patent include a communication circuit , gyroscope and accelerometer			0
however , mr @entity26 said he does n't expect @entity6 's debut stylus to have these features			1
instead , the company will add them gradually over the coming years , or users could choose which features they wanted			0
and he expects 3d handwriting to be featured on later models , too			0
these could be called ' expansion models ' , and were hinted at in the february @entity74 patent			0
early @entity74 patents , dating back to may 2012 , featured just a speaker and haptic feedback			1
although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010			1
this haptic feature would make the @entity74 vibrate as it moves around the screen , to tell a user they ’ve performed a certain action			0
@entity6 has filed more than 22 separate patents for the so - called smart @entity74 , since 2012			1
although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010			1
in february last year , one such patent included images of a ' modular stylus '			1
each module is shown having a different function including a camera , recorder , laser pointer , and more early @entity74 patents featured just a speaker and haptic feedback			0
a separate patent ( pictured ) added orientation features in which the @entity74 would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at			0
this means users could change the thickness or style of a line , or make writing more closely resemble their own @entity125 already makes a smart stylus for use with its own products , in particular the @entity130 range , known as the @entity130			1
the tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch , yet it will also work even when its hovered about the screen , adding what @entity125 calls a ' magic wand ' effect			0
double - tapping the pen on the screen opens a post-it - style note , while pressing the tip activates the @entity130 menu			2
@entity6 began filing patents for the so - called @entity74 back in 2012			1
for example , if the stylus was used with a drawing program or app , the feedback would be designed to mimic a brush or pencil			0
a separate patent added orientation features in which the @entity74 would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at			0
this means users could change the thickness or style of a line , or make writing more closely resemble their own			0
@entity125 already offers a smart stylus , called the @entity130 , designed to boost productivity on the @entity163			1
the tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch , yet it will also work even when its hovered above the screen , adding what @entity125 calls a ' magic wand ' effect			0
@entity125 already makes a smart stylus for use with its own products , in particular the @entity130 range , known as the @entity130 ( pictured )			1
the tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch , yet it will also work even when its hovered above the screen name : popular suggestions for the name of the tablet include @entity181 - taking its lead from @entity6 's @entity62 , and the @entity183 size : the tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch screen , although other dimensions up to 12.9 inches have also been suggested			1
rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick			0
design : the leaked ' sketch ' suggests that the @entity181 will be similar in design to the @entity192 2 , with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges			0
@entity198 : the image differs from the smaller tablet however , because of grilles on the top of the shell , which suggest the device will include stereo speakers , as rumoured			0
launch : sources have suggested different launch times , but there is some consensus the tablet may make its debut before the summer			0
double - tapping the pen on the screen opens a post-it - style note , while pressing the tip activates the @entity130 menu			2
rumours about an upcoming @entity6 ' super ' tablet have been gaining traction recently after at least two images were leaked that appeared to show the device			2
one photo of a mould was reportedly taken at @entity6 manufacturer @entity228 's factory in @entity229 and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide			2
it follows a leaked sketch from earlier in the month that claimed to show one corner of the so - called megapad , @entity234 or @entity181			1
the latest image was posted on @entity229 social network @entity236			0
if the rumours are true , the @entity234 would be significantly larger than the current @entity192 2			2
experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height , 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep ( 305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm )			0
mr @entity26 said he does n't expect @entity6 's debut stylus to have a range of smart features			1
instead , @entity6 will add them gradually , or users could choose which ones they wanted			2
another patent for an @entity6 stylus is shown in particular , the stylus could be used with @entity6 's rumoured ' super ' tablet , dubbed @entity234 ( leaked mould pictured )			1
experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height , 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep ( 305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm ) @entity6 's @entity234 is expected to have either a 12.2 - inch or 12.9 - inch display			1
a stylus ( patent image pictured ) could help productivity on the giant tablet by comparison , the @entity261 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm )			0
the @entity263 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity234 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch screen			1
this would put the @entity267 on par with @entity125 's 12.2 - inch @entity269 , which launched in february			1
the leaked sketch , also reportedly taken by an employee who works at @entity228 seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound			0
the image was released by @entity278 website @entity276 , which has previously leaked details from unannounced smartphones and @entity6 gadgets which proved to be true , citing a @entity228 source			2
the source said that initial testing for the @entity181 was stopped in the summer and @entity6 ’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet .			2

@entity6 was awarded its first smart stylus patents back in 2012
the @entity291 firm has filed more than 22 separate pen patents

the claims were made by @entity26 of @entity27 to @entity28
