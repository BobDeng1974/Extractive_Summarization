the prisoners who survived are believed to have moved to @entity35 near @entity36 or to @entity38 's @entity37 , about which virtually nothing is known			2
the closure came as @entity2 leader @entity26 consolidated his grip on power following the death of his father in 2011 , @entity26 - @entity45 now the @entity6 has called for an inquiry into their fate			1
the report stated : ' @entity2 's 2009 currency devaluation ( whereby camp authorities were reportedly unable to purchase food in markets to supplement the crops grown in the camps ) , combined with bad harvests , resulted in the death of large numbers of prisoners after 2010 , ' the report states			1
' if even remotely accurate , this is an atrocity requiring much closer investigation			0
' while the report covers all of @entity2 's gulags , it focuses a large part of its attention on the situation in @entity24			1
intelligence : human rights campaigners glean evidence of @entity24 through satellite images secrecy : @entity24 was believed to have been located in the @entity73 of the country on the @entity76 border @entity6 spoke to defectors , including former guards , and occasional camp survivors to compile the report			1

@entity6 estimates even after the closures of two camps , about 130,000 people are still being held in labour colonies across the country			0
the report stated : ' through this vast system of unlawful imprisonment , the @entity2 regime isolates , banishes , punishes and executes those suspected of being disloyal to the regime			2
' they are deemed " wrong - thinkers " , " wrong - doers " , or those who have acquired " wrong - knowledge " or have engaged in " wrong - associations "			0
' the report added : ' @entity2 denies access to the camps to outsiders , whether human rights investigators , scholars , or international media and severely restricts the circulation of information across its borders			1
' brutal : the new leader closed camps to consolidate his grip after the death of @entity116 ( pictured ) few prisoners ever make it out to tell the tale			2
those who have paint a bleak picture of life on the inside			0

they face abuse by guards , torture , sexual violence and can even be worked to death			0
those caught attempting to escape are executed			0
@entity145 , co-chairman of @entity6 , called for the @entity146 to be granted access to the camps as soon as possible			0
she said : ' an accounting of the fate and whereabouts of all of @entity2 's political prisoners , including those missing and those who have died in detention , should be of highest priority to the @entity157 commission of inquiry and the entire international community			1
' stalinist : there was a national outpouring of grief when @entity26 died , while thousands languished in jail			0

thousands of prisoners are missing after the closure of brutal @entity24
