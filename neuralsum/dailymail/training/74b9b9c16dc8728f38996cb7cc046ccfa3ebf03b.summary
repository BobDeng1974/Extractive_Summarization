by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 11 october 2013 strokes have fallen by 40 per cent in just 16 years thanks to the growing use of statins			1
the prescribing of blood pressure drugs have also helped cause rates to plummet among older people - those most vulnerable to their devastating effects			1
huge advances have been made in the treatment of patients with high cholesterol and high blood pressure			1
professor @entity15 , chairman of charity @entity17 @entity16 , said stroke rates were plummeting ' throughout the @entity16 ' as a result of better treatments six million @entity16 take drugs to lower their blood pressure , usually for life			1
in addition , more than eight million take statins to reduce cholesterol levels - meaning these are now the most widely prescribed drugs in @entity16			1
many older people have also heeded campaigns to have medical checks , and to make lifestyle changes such as cutting back on salt			2
as a result , the incidence of strokes has dropped from 247 per 100,000 in 1995 to 149.5 in 2010 , according to researchers at @entity38			0
professor @entity15 , chairman of charity @entity17 @entity16 , said stroke rates were plummeting ‘ throughout the @entity16 ’ as a result of better treatments			2
‘ we ’ve got better blood pressure drugs now and they are used more effectively , ’ he said			1
‘ in the past @entity43 would prescribe one drug			0
‘ but we now know they work more effectively in combination , and they are often more acceptable to patients , with fewer side effects , so they take them and do n’t leave them in the medicines cupboard			0
‘ statins cut the risk of stroke by 30 to 40 per cent so they have also played a part , but we need to do more			2
’ he said the study demonstrated a huge proportion of strokes were preventable			0
‘ every patient who ends up on a stroke ward is a sorry indictment of our failure to help prevent it , ’ he said			0
huge advances have been made in the treatment of patients with high cholesterol and high blood pressure dr @entity71 , lecturer in medical statistics at @entity38 and lead author of the research , said ‘ this study on the trends in stroke is the most comprehensive in the @entity16			1
it shows a 40 per cent overall reduction of stroke over 16 years , which is good news			1
’ strokes affect around 152,000 @entity16 each year , often triggered by high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels			1
patients with hypertension – the medical term for high blood pressure – are routinely advised to change their lifestyle and eat less salt , lose weight , drink less alcohol , eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more			2
the study , published in the medical journal @entity94 analysed records on 4,245 patients living in @entity97 who had their first - ever stroke between 1995 and 2010			0
but the findings are likely to apply to the rest of the country , say researchers			0
six million @entity16 take drugs to lower their blood pressure , usually for life			1
in addition , more than eight million take statins to reduce cholesterol levels - meaning these are now the most widely prescribed drugs in @entity16 the rate fell in men , women , white groups and those aged more than 45			1
but it did not drop among those aged 15 to 44 years and black groups			0
‘ the reasons for this are not entirely clear but it could be because of a rise in diabetes and obesity in these groups , ’ dr @entity71 said			0
‘ if this trend is not reversed we could face a major public health concern because long - term disability , as a result of stroke , will put a strain on health and social care services			0
’ researchers are calling for greater efforts to identify younger people at risk , including those with diabetes			0
co-author professor @entity141 said : ‘ it is essential we begin to understand the reasons for the differences in incidence and how we can address them			0
without this we are only going to see widening health inequalities amongst the @entity16 population			2
