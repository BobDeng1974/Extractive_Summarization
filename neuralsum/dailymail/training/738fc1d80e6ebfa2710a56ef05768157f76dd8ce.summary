sometimes a result can mask an injustice but @entity2 knew exactly what he was doing when he took out @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
there was no possibility of him playing the ball and he made a challenge which could have seriously injured the @entity5 player			1
@entity12 defender @entity2 ( left ) was booked for a wild challenge on @entity5 's @entity4 hazard was on the receiving end of the tackle after attempting to dribble past @entity2 @entity2 tackled @entity4 at knee - height with the ball already gone during their @entity20 match the tackle sent the @entity23 international flying in the air at the @entity25 on monday night hazard was left in a heap on the pitch after @entity2 's wild tackle on monday night the fact that he was given a yellow card means the @entity33 can take no further action			1
@entity35 is not rated as one of the top @entity20 referees and after missing such a blatant red card one can understand why			2
@entity2 should be gone here			2
the first foul by the @entity5 byline was worthy of a yellow , too			0
his manager @entity42 is not helping either			0
he has been complaining since the first minute			0
@entity5 ’s only problem would come if they allow themselves to be sucked in to a scrap			0
@entity2 's tackle had @entity5 boss @entity45 ( centre ) fuming on the touchline @entity45 was apoplectic ( left ) at the challenge but appeared calm as he spoke to @entity2 at full - time @entity50 ca n't fault @entity12 performance			1

@entity5 *won* 2 - 0 away at @entity12 in the @entity20 on monday night
@entity12 defender @entity2 *scythed* down @entity4 in the first half
knee - high tackle left @entity5 *playmaker* hazard in a heap on the pitch
