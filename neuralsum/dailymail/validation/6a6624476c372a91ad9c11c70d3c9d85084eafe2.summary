a radical extension of @entity2 ’s flagship housing policy is set to be included in the conservative manifesto as @entity5 bid to woo working - class voters			1
the @entity7 would be extended to up to 2.5million housing - association tenants , transforming the lives of many			0
the reform , backed by senior conservatives including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , is expected to be included in a ‘ big doorstep offer ’ on housing from the @entity5			1
pictured , mrs @entity2 at the @entity22 in 1989 the party is also considering plans to force councils to sell large , expensive council homes in order to fund higher numbers of cheaper properties			1
a @entity31 source said : ‘ the prime minister has been a big supporter of @entity7 to buy , so that more people can own a home of their own			2
but our manifesto will be announced nearer the election			0
’ enabling housing - association tenants to buy their homes would likely require major changes to the @entity41 , forcing associations to sell properties at discounts set by government			2
the @entity46 has increased @entity7 to buy discounts , meaning more council homes are already moving to the private sector			1
prime minister @entity50 ( pictured left ) is a big supporter of @entity7 to buy , a @entity53 source said , and the reform is backed by senior conservatives , including the mayor of london @entity13 ( right ) but housing associations have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing			1
