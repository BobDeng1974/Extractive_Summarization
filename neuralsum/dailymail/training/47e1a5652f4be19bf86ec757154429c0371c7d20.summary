by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 26 july 2013 councillors in a seaside resort are hoping to ban naked events over fears the charity fundraisers are scaring away families			1
@entity7 in @entity8 has been the venue for a sponsored skinny - dip and a nude bike ride in the past few weeks , with many locals saying the fun events livened up the area			1
but the leader of the district council is now stepping in and attempting to block any further naked get - togethers in order to protect the town 's ' image '			1
protest : dozens of cyclists took to the town 's roads to demonstrate against the dangers of riding bikes last month , more than 100 people stripped off and went for an early - morning dip in the sea on a @entity7 beach to raise money for @entity31			1
and on saturday , around 35 naked cyclists took to the town 's roads in protest against the dangers faced by bike riders - and the organiser plans to hold the event again next year			1
@entity40 , @entity41 leader of @entity42 , railed against the nude events and vowed to stop them happening again			2
' @entity7 is a traditional family seaside resort and in my opinion people riding around on bikes with no clothes on does nothing to enhance our image - in fact it harms it , ' he said			1
leave your clothes behind : the swimmers were raising money for @entity31 good - natured : but local councillors have criticised the events because they are not family - friendly ' they did not apply to use land under our responsibility so there was little we could do other than work with other agencies on a bit of a damage - limitation exercise			2
' however , i now want to get together with the police and others round the table and come up with a plan to put a halt to naked events in our area before it all goes too far			0
' @entity76 , the councillor responsible for health and safety , added : ' i will certainly be bringing this matter up with the police and will suggest that we investigate what we can do in the future to prevent a repeat of what we have witnessed this summer			0
' the council singled out the cycle ride as being more damaging than the swim , as it took place in the town centre during the middle of the day			2
but @entity92 , the organiser of the bike protest , insisted he was making an important argument and pledged to attract up to 100 cyclists to next year 's event			2
good fun : the nude events are said to have gone down well with most locals despite the controversy intrusive ? officials are worried the nudity has driven away tourists from the town 's beaches ' the event was to protest against car culture and the idea of riding naked is to highlight the vulnerability of cyclists , ' he said			1
' being naked in public is n't an offence in itself			0
' similar events are held in towns and cities around the world and across the @entity119 in places like @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
' the @entity123 event attracts thousands of people and benefits shops and traders in the area			0
' the 47 - year - old , who is also hoping to break the world record for the largest ever naked fun run , continued : ' there were more people in favour of our event than against it			0
we got a huge cheer as we rode down the @entity139			0
' an @entity141 spokesman said : ' there has been a precedent from similar events held in @entity121 and @entity123 in the past and it was deemed that there were no legal grounds to prevent it going ahead			0
