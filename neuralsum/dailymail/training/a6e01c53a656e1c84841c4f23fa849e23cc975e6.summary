strung between the palm trees in the middle of @entity3 was a crude , home - made banner			2
black spray paint on what appeared to be a white sheet			0
‘ @entity11 — @entity12 te apoya , ’ it read			1
‘ @entity13 — @entity12 supports you			0
the @entity12 team arrived at their beachfront home in @entity18 , to the west of @entity20 , on thursday night to a hero ’s welcome			0
@entity23 may be the big villain of this @entity24 in the eyes of many , but critical and ethical faculties have been suspended in his homeland			1
the fans that congregated around the team bus were unequivocal			0
‘ @entity31 is corrupt , ’ they chanted			1
‘ @entity31 does not play football , but destroys it			1
yet , for @entity12 , the banishment of @entity11 is a disgrace , not a comic caption on @entity69			1
arriving in @entity18 the captain , @entity70 , was taken almost immediately to the hotel ’s gym , where he met that other noted arbiter of fair play , @entity33			1
the pair enjoyed a long and animated conversation , in @entity77 , for the benefit of the television network covering @entity33 ’s trip			1
@entity81 is a @entity82 company based in @entity83			0
do your own jokes , you know you want to			0
the television screens high on the wall had @entity11 ’s clash with @entity51 of @entity52 on an almost constant loop , interspersed with the most telegenic outrages of @entity93 past			1
@entity94 tackles , spitting at the referee , flying elbows and a torrent of red cards and redder mists were edited into a giant ball of malcontent			0
yet it all kept coming back to one man , now close to quarantined back home in @entity12 , considering his next move			0
@entity33 was flat on his back lifting weights when @entity70 entered , but on sighting the captain he clambered to his feet to offer warm and effusive congratulations for sticking up for @entity11 in public			1
glum - faced : @entity11 will miss @entity12 's next nine matches and ca n't play for @entity114 again until october 26 @entity115 persecuted by media - @entity70 there was no doubt where @entity33 also stood , having made his feelings plain by going on air to present his television show @entity122 — it means ‘ the @entity123 ’ — wearing a t - shirt with the message ‘ @entity126 ’ ( ‘ @entity23 , we are with you ’ )			1
the pair began to talk for the @entity81 cameras and it was clear this was going to be no rigorous inspection of moral standards and the boundaries of professional behaviour			0
‘ they treated him like a criminal , ’ said @entity70			0
‘ escorted out of our camp by the police			0
why would n’t i defend him at that press conference ? he ’s such a great guy and this ban is very harsh			2
‘ it hits him at the very top of his level , at the best moment in his career			0
it is a very sad time for @entity12 and for @entity23			1
’ @entity70 added that he hoped the team could grow stronger through adversity and with the support of the people			0
‘ i do n’t understand it , ’ @entity33 told him			1
‘ the whole world was waiting to see @entity11 at this @entity24			1
he had scored 31 goals in @entity158 last season			0
’ they then agreed that he had been banned only due to historical stuff			2
that this ancient history was two previous offences for the same crime seemed of little import			0
‘ this is the most important moment in @entity23 ’s life , ’ @entity70 concluded			1
if he meant that he had to now choose one path , glory or infamy , therefore introducing the first tiny concession that behind this furore was a basically contemptible act that could never be repeated , he left the thought unsaid			0
national hero : @entity11 was greeted by hundreds of @entity175 after his early exit from @entity177 fervent fans : @entity11 supporters gather at @entity180 to welcome their hero home they parted with a hug of pure simpatico , as it is called in these parts ; both victims , in their own minds at least , of terrible injustice			1
it has not taken long for @entity33 — still bitter over his expulsion from the 1994 @entity24 for drug offences — to identify with @entity11 , whom he sees as another renegade genius living beyond @entity31 ’s margins			1
speaking earlier on his show , @entity33 compared @entity31 ’s punishment to sending @entity11 to @entity197 in handcuffs			1
‘ the @entity31 sanction is shameful , ’ he said			1
‘ it is a way of punishing @entity12 clubs for asking the @entity203 federation for a fairer share of money			0
it hurts that they have cut short the career of a lad who is a winner			0
it ’s an excessive suspension and @entity31 can not talk about morals to anyone			1
‘ a player works hard the whole year to be able to play at the @entity24 and they kick him out like this			1
‘ remember @entity214 and what he did in the 2006 world cup final ? @entity31 then gave him the @entity217			1
in this @entity24 there have been much greater incidents than @entity11 ’s			1
he did n’t kill anyone			0
this is an unjust punishment , the act of an incredible mafia			2
’ @entity33 ’s guest was @entity12 president @entity225 , who had earlier made a wasted journey to @entity180 outside @entity227 , where @entity11 was expected to return			1
that the head of state should wish to welcome home a footballer ejected from the @entity24 for biting an opponent affords some insight into the skewed @entity12 mentality over this			2
@entity235 looks like a much - loved grandpa and has modern , liberal , left - wing views on gay marriage , abortion and wealth distribution , but he knows how to work a crowd , too			2
home support : a @entity12 displays a banner reading : ' @entity31 corrupt			2
we support you @entity11 ' biting wit : tourists joke in front of an advert on the @entity57 he gives 90 per cent of his salary to charity and has refused to move from a one - bedroom farmhouse to the palace that comes with his office			1
this makes him one of the most enlightened political leaders on any continent , but not immune to the odd act of pure populism			0
the gathering at @entity180 included fans with banners and large cardboard cut - outs of @entity11 ’s face , some with false vampire teeth , celebrating an act that should provoke only revulsion			1
@entity235 instinctively knew on which side his bread was buttered			0
‘ we feel that this is an assault on the poor , ’ @entity235 said			0
‘ this gang will not forgive @entity11 because he never went to university , he is n’t educated , he grew up on the field , he is a natural rebel and expresses his anger naturally			2
‘ we have seen all the games and this is a different punishment			2
this is the most indignant punishment			0
here they add everything together but the boy really should n’t be blamed			0
it ’s a match and these things happen			0
there ’s no need to look into every incident , because if we did that in each game we ’d play five - a - side			0
’ iconic figure : @entity11 has become one of the lasting memories of this @entity24 leaving a mark : a young @entity11 fan poses with vampire teeth at @entity180 of course , there are plenty of working - class people in @entity300 who go through a considerably more impoverished life than @entity11 is experiencing without biting anybody , but @entity12 is in no mood for logic or social realism right now			1
they are the victims here , the tiny nation of three million — ‘ @entity311 … vamos @entity12 ! ’ it says on the team bus , which translates as ‘ three million dreams … let ’s go @entity12 ’ — that has been conspired against by the superpowers of @entity158 , @entity52 and @entity31			2
do they have a point ? not really			0
there is no way @entity31 could look at this incident in isolation , considering the recidivism in @entity11 ’s behaviour , meaning wider comparisons are inappropriate			1
yet they are being made , constantly			0
one debate concerns the case of @entity326 of @entity327 , banned for 10 international games — but not from all football — for using the @entity330 inspired ‘ @entity331 ! ’ chant after @entity327 ’s win over @entity334			2
‘ not as bad as @entity11 ? ’ it was asked on @entity177 television			2
yet equivalency can be used to pick holes in any sanction : certainly when , to the banner - wavers , the apologists and @entity342 , the only correct punishment is no punishment at all .			2

@entity33 has publicly backed @entity11 following his @entity31 ban
@entity33 wore a t - shirt with the message ' @entity23 , we are with you '
@entity33 blasted @entity31 as a ' mafia ' and likened @entity11 's punishment to being thrown into @entity197
@entity33 was *slapped* with a 15 - month ban from football during the 1994 @entity24 after testing *positive* for the banned *stimulant* *ephedrine*
