’ prosecutors claim @entity8 pulled out of the queue in her @entity33 to overtake the truck - but did not see that @entity10 , who was further back , had also pulled out to overtake in her @entity35			1
mr @entity17 told the court : ‘ i looked in my mirror and saw something flying through the air			1
i must have seen some sort of collision with plastic flying			2
i was not sure what it was			2
‘ i saw the blue @entity35 come in front on me at an awkward angle as if it was not going to make it			0
i knew the driver did n’t look right - and when it touched the grass it seemed to lose it altogether			1
‘ it was more or less back straight and went sideways into the tree			0
it careered across the front of me and seemed to lose control when it hit the grass more			0
it all happened so quickly			0
‘ it hit the tree very hard			0
there was an orange flash and a bit of smoke			0
i saw a girl running down the road			0
i said “ that was a big one ”			2
she shouted : “ that was my sister ”			1
’ @entity67 , defending , said to mr @entity17 : ‘ you remember the lady ( @entity8 ) being very upset			1
she was effectively being hysterical			0
when you saw her she was not running to the blue car			0
in court : @entity8 ( centre ) , who was on her way home at the time of the crash , denies the charge ‘ she had been to the blue car and was running back to you			1
you knew that a blue and a grey car had been involved in an accident			2
’ mr @entity17 said : ‘ the lady ( @entity8 ) was in such a state , other people led her way			1
’ mr @entity67 added : ‘ she was someone who was beyond self - control ? ’ mr @entity17 replied : ‘ definitely			2

’ also dead : the women were sisters of private @entity92 , a soldier killed in @entity93 in june 2012 asked about his statement by mr @entity67 , mr @entity17 replied : ‘ i might have said that in the heat of the moment			1
it was not going over fast			0
when you are doing 40mph , everything seems quick			0
’ @entity102 , a delivery driver who was driving a red @entity104 transit van and witnessed the crash , told the jury : ‘ the blue car ( driven by @entity10 ) got out and was passing me			1
i thought she should not have done that			0
i said “ @entity109 ”			0
' she should not be doing that			0
there was a car coming in the opposite direction			0
my fear was she was not going to make it back in time to avoid the on - coming traffic			2
' i was doing about 40mph , so maybe it was doing 50mph			0
i thought she had gone too far to the right and clipped the barrier			0
she lost control of the car and skidded across the road			0
' i did n’t see another car bye or near the other car when it hit the barrier			0
’ meanwhile , @entity130 senior accident investigator @entity129 told the court that @entity8 failed to look in her rear - view mirror to check before she pulled out			1
he said : ‘ however long @entity10 was in that offside lane , @entity8 would have had a clear view of @entity10 behind her			1
‘ in my view it is not safe to pull out if you do n't have a clear view , because you can not be sure you are not pulling out in to the path of another vehicle			2
’ mr @entity129 told the jury he had visited the scene of the accident and that scuffing on the two women ’s cars matched , showing the older sister was travelling faster at the point of impact			1
he said : ‘ in my view the most likely scenario is @entity10 had moved out of to commence and overtake behind the transit van , behind the ( @entity152 ) @entity151			1
‘ the minimum distance between the two sisters is 27 metres when @entity10 pulls out			1
we do n't know the exact gaps			0

‘ she said : " other cars were overtaking a hgv in front , and my sister was behind me			1
i pulled out to overtake too - into the path of my sister behind me ”			2
’ ' there was an orange flash and a bit of smoke			0

i provided oxygen and a drug through a mask on the face			0
