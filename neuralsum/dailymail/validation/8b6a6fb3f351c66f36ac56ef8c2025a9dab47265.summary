you know you ’re having a bad day at the office when @entity4 ’s @entity3 is celebrating a goal like he ’s @entity6			1
that ’s precisely what happened to hopeless @entity9 on saturday			0
@entity3 converted @entity4 ’s third goal inside 42 minutes at a rampant @entity11 after earlier strikes from @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 ( right ) pulls his best @entity6 celebration after scoring the @entity4 ' third goal the @entity4 defender wheels away after scoring his side 's third goal in the 3 - 1 victory @entity3 is chased by his @entity4 team - mates as he races towards the corner flag @entity3 takes part in the beginning of his ronaldo-esque goal celebration as fans laugh behind @entity6 shows hos his trademark celebration ends after netting against @entity30 in midweek @entity6 's trademark celebration fails to win over @entity33 fans during a @entity35 clash and @entity37 was @entity3 ’s enthusiasm with his first goal in close to 100 appearances for the @entity4 , you can perhaps forgive him for his rather cringe - worthy celebration			1
picking up the ball inside the @entity9 penalty area , @entity3 slotted the ball past @entity9 stopper @entity45 with a cool left - footed strike			1
the 25 - year - old then sprinted off towards the corner flag before leaping up in the air and stretching his arms behind his back			0
@entity6 has n’t played in the @entity52 for the best part of six years following his mega-money move from @entity55 to @entity56 in the summer of 2009			2
but for a moment it was as if the world footballer of the year was back in @entity61 ’s top flight			0
@entity62 has taken struggling @entity4 to within two points of his former club @entity64 @entity13 was credited with opening the scoring before colliding heavily with the goal post @entity14 gestures to his shin after doubling the @entity4 ' lead at @entity11 it summed up an embarrassing 45 minutes from @entity9 who are set to be cast further adrift of @entity71 as they , along with @entity72 and @entity73 , stare at immediate relegation back to the @entity75			1
in contrast , @entity4 , flying - high under @entity62 , are set to move to within two points of his old team @entity64 in 11th place			0
it is n’t the first time a @entity52 star has mimicked one of @entity6 ’s iconic celebrations			2
earlier this season , @entity85 attracted much hilarity when he puffed out his chest in the same vein as the @entity56 star after scoring in @entity92 ’s win against @entity93			0
@entity92 striker @entity85 ( centre ) raised a smile by copying @entity6 after scoring against @entity93			0
