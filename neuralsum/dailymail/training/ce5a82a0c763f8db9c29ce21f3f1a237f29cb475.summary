was the note written in anger by a resentful @entity2 , desperate to escape his unhappy marriage ? or was it a play on words penned with the knowledge of @entity6 , that the musician carried around to remind him of their unconventional bond ? those who believe that @entity6 was involved in her husband 's death will point to the fact that the content and tone of this note wildly differs from his handwritten suicide note			1
