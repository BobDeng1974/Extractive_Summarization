secret affair : solicitor @entity1 spent thousands paying the rent for his @entity11 lover 's apartment in @entity14 as well as handing her £ 280,000 in cash scam : @entity1 claimed travel expenses for numerous fake journeys between @entity79 and @entity80 that he never took prosecutor @entity81 said : ‘ @entity1 , who was a trusted partner of @entity30 - a very important firm of solicitors in the city - made multiple fraudulent travel expense claims totalling £ 1.274m			1
‘ mr @entity1 had the authority , because he was trusted as a senior member of the frim to authorise his own expenses , though he had to account for that with supporting documents			1

‘ there ’s no doubt that the motive was financial betterment or greed			0

‘ it is a result of that mental illness that in part you behaved the way in which you did			0

‘ given the other financial difficulties he already had this behaviour was totally bizarre and , i would submit , a real indication of the extent to which he had become derailed with his thinking and judgement at this time of his life			0
