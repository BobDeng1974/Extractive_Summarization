@entity37 , @entity3 ceo , said : ' overall we are satisfied with the outcome			0
while disappointed with the award for swimming , we recognise we need to rebuild confidence that we can deliver medals at @entity2 level consistently before we can demand more investment			2

' everyone involved in swimming remains committed to working hard towards achieving success in @entity55 and beyond			2
' despite the cuts , @entity3 saw an increase in funding for four other aquatic sports - disability swimming , diving , synchro and women 's water polo			1
' we are delighted to see increased investment in disability swimming and diving which is richly deserved although there remains still much to do in these areas before @entity55 , ' said @entity37			2
' the funding of women 's water polo and synchronised swimming is welcomed as clearly @entity7 recognises the tremendous progress these two sports have made in the last four - to - five years			1
' @entity75 did better on the athletics track than expected , with the highlights including gold medal performances from @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , and this has been reflected in their funding			0
golden : @entity79 won two gold medals at @entity13			0

@entity94 performance director , @entity93 , said : ' we 're very pleased to receive the increased levels of support across both @entity2 and @entity99 performance programmes			0
' the investment in athletics reflects the progress made over the last four years and demonstrates confidence in our plans for the next @entity2 cycle			0
' @entity99 head coach , @entity106 , added : ' funding from @entity7 and the @entity108 was an integral part of our success in @entity112 this summer and we are absolutely delighted to be receiving an increased investment of 59 per cent into the @entity99 programme			1
' @entity115 , chair of @entity116 , said : ' the @entity117 would not be where it is today without the backing and support we have received from @entity7 and the @entity108			1
' there was also a welcome from sailing , with @entity127 performance director @entity126 saying of the increase from £ 22,942,700 for @entity112 : ' @entity130 's @entity2 award is broadly welcomed and will enable us to start implementing our plans for the @entity55 cycle , off the back of having successfully delivered another five medals at the @entity2 this summer to remain one of @entity138 's most consistently high - performing @entity2 sports			1
' we 're grateful to @entity7 for their continued confidence in the @entity127 's @entity140 , and look forward to the clarity and opportunity that these awards now provide us with in our planning for @entity11 and 2020			1
