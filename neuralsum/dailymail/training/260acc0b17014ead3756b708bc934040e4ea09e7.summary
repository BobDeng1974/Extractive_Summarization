by @entity0 @entity1 handed @entity2 a huge injury boost as he trained ahead of their @entity5 quarter - final against @entity6 at the @entity7			1
@entity1 missed @entity2 's 4 - 0 win over @entity9 at the weekend after it emerged that he may have chipped a bone in his foot			1
@entity12 also trained after missing the @entity9 game but @entity14 , who came off at @entity15 suffering from dizziness , and @entity17 did not take part			0
@entity1 appeared to have no adverse reaction to the injury and he seemed in good spirits during training			2
@entity2 boss @entity37 revealed that @entity1 was ‘ touch and go ’ for the second leg at the @entity7 after suffering what was thought to be a badly bruised toe in last week ’s 1 - 1 draw at @entity55 , but it now appears that the damage may be more serious			1
however , the 28 - year - old @entity59 forward is determined to play in @entity2 ’s biggest game of the season with the help of powerful painkilling tablets as @entity37 ’ side bid to end @entity6 ’s reign as @entity67 champions			1
and @entity6 coach @entity19 was in no doubt that @entity1 would line up for the @entity69 on wednesday night			1
he said : ' @entity1 is going to play , 100 per cent			2
he is going to play , i bet you a big big glass of beer			0
' @entity19 described @entity1 as ' a big player , one of the best i have seen in my career			0
' the odds remain against @entity2 as they take on the @entity67 champions , despite their creditable performance in the first leg			2
yet for @entity1 , confidence that @entity2 can not only triumph but go on to win the competition , is still high			1
ouch ! @entity1 picked up his injury in the 1 - 1 draw between @entity2 and @entity6 last week waiting game : manager @entity37 will give @entity1 every chance to prove his fitness the @entity59 forward told @entity90 : ' of course ( i believe we can win it )			1
' everyone has their favourites every year - the likes of @entity98 and @entity6 - but it does not always happen			0
' when @entity100 won it they nearly went out of the competition three times			0
' we believe we can go through			0
we have good enough players			0
' it will be tough because in my opinion @entity6 and @entity98 are the two best teams left in the competition , so we have to be at our best			0
spot on : @entity1 has been back among the goals in his last few games , including a penalty against @entity113 volley good show : @entity2 team - mates congratulate @entity1 after his wonder goal against @entity118 ' we are ready			1
it 's an exciting game for us all - the players and the fans - and it 's a massive game to be involved in			0
' there is an 11 - day gap between the @entity6 clash and @entity2 ’s next fixture away to his old club @entity127 on april 20 , and it is hoped that will be enough to allow a full recovery			1
@entity1 is understood to have been reassured that he would not risk worsening the problem , with the @entity133 in @entity134 just over two months away			0
a similar move backfired when @entity2 met @entity6 in this competition four years ago			2
@entity1 aggravated an ankle injury in the second leg and it was later claimed that contributed to his below - par display at @entity142 2010			2
tread carefully : @entity1 will not want to aggravate the injury ahead of the @entity133 with @entity59 an omen ? @entity1 injured himself in the 2010 quarter - final against @entity6 before a poor show at the @entity133 after the training session concluded , @entity1 said he was feeling good about wednesday night 's second leg			1
he wrote on his facebook page : ' good training session with the lads ahead of the @entity6 match tomorrow night			2
' it 's a massive game for us against a top side but we 'll be going in confident and looking to progress into the semi-finals			0
