according to reports in @entity2 @entity1 are closing in on £ 12million rated @entity4 midfielder @entity3			1
despite revealing @entity1 are one of his two favourite teams in @entity8 - along with @entity2 rivals @entity9 has also been linked for a move to @entity11			2
what kind of player is he ? a very modern @entity15 – not a flair player but unflappable in the holding midfield role			1
he can dictate the pace of a game and organize a team			2
he has a great first touch and good awareness			0
and he ’s only 21 so he has plenty of years ahead of him to adjust to @entity24 football			2
he also has a reputation for being level - headed and willing to learn and improve – essential if he ’s to fit in at a big club and learn a new language			2
he was named in the league ’s team of the season at the end of the campaign			1
price ? @entity4 president @entity46 has said he will not negotiate for anything less than £ 12million			1
he also knows there are several clubs interested with @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity11 all keen			0
what ’s his preference ? he has been quoted as saying that his favourite teams in @entity8 are @entity1 and @entity9			0
but that answer may well differ according to who is asking			0
he has also said the @entity24 - based player he models himself on is @entity57			1
after a consistent performances for his club the @entity4 man featured in the @entity62 team of the season modelling himself on @entity66 midfielder @entity65 could be on his way to the @entity68 does he get forward as well as @entity57 ? he only scored three times last season for his club but he did score in the @entity74 @entity73 tournament for @entity35 against @entity75 last may			1
@entity35 went on to beat @entity76 in the final and he was one of the stand - out performers			2
he is not as attacking a player as @entity57 but he does n’t just sit ; he brings the ball out from the back			1
has he played for @entity35 yet ? he has moved up to the @entity82 and will step up to the senior team soon without doubt			0
he will definitely be part of the @entity87 team at @entity88			0
he ’s not the finished product though ? not by any means			0
@entity4 ’s previous coach @entity91 wanted to loan him out for experience and it was only when @entity93 took over as manager that he became first choice			1
so another project for @entity11 if @entity97 lands him then ? @entity1 seem pretty convinced they have him but who knows ? it ’s a long road to the first team at the @entity101			0
@entity97 would certainly be able to offer him first team football sooner so that may persuade him to turn his back on @entity1 and move to @entity104 .			0

the 21 - year - old @entity15 plays in a holding midfield role for @entity4
featured in @entity15 @entity62 team of the season after consistent displays
@entity3 said he bases himself on @entity66 midfielder @entity57
