@entity23 spokesman @entity50 told @entity0 on monday that there were no plans to use the system at upcoming races ' so we 'll have ample time to review			1
' @entity8 said the camera system consists of three ropes - a drive rope that moves the camera back and forth , and two guide ropes on either side			2
@entity8 said it was the drive rope that failed near the first - turn connection and fell to the track			2
hazard : cars race by as the cable hangs over the infield from an aerial @entity8 camera ' the camera itself did not come down because guide ropes acted as designed , ' @entity8 said in the statement			1
' a full investigation is planned , and use of the camera is suspended indefinitely			1
' @entity8 said it has used the camera system at the @entity80 , at last week 's @entity82 race and other major sporting events			1

@entity124 and @entity125 also reported damage			0
the cars were initially brought along pit row as workers cleared the ropes from the track			2
@entity23 first threw a caution flag before two red flags came out			2
it eventually allowed the cars to come into the pits , giving crews 15 minutes to work on their cars			2
affected : the cars of @entity116 ( 18 ) , @entity140 ( 5 ) and @entity141 ( 20 ) were believed to have been damaged by the fallen cable during the break , @entity116 's crew frantically worked to repair a number of problems to the right front wheel well			1

round - up : a worker cleans up a broken television camera cable that damaged several race cars during the @entity23 series @entity3 600 ' i just heard a big thunk on the right - front side tire and thought the right - front tire blew out , ' @entity116 said			1
' that 's how hard it felt ... it did have an effect slowing my car down and i could feel it like , " @entity178 , that 's weird			0
" i do n't know that anybody has ever seen that			0
maybe now we can get rid of that thing			0
' it was more bad luck for @entity116 , who has never won a @entity23 race at @entity1 and suffered his share of bad luck			2
@entity140 , who wound up finishing second behind @entity188 , said he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him when he saw something strange on the track			0
' i have never seen anything like it , ' @entity140 said			0
' i came off turn four and i saw it wrapped around @entity116 's car and it hit mine and i thought i had to be seeing things because there 's no way there could be a cable on the race track			2
teamwork : a crew gathers the cable from the track during a red flag in the race by the time we got to turn one i saw it again and saw @entity116 's fender and saw his car go down a little			2
that 's when i knew i was n't seeing things			0
' @entity23 said the camera system in question is from @entity219			1
