@entity0 is a senior pastor at the @entity1 in @entity2 and also a fully qualified @entity4 firearms instructor			1
the father - of - four normally has a bible in one hand and an @entity9 assault rifle in the other while spreading the word of the lord			1
@entity0 lives with his wife @entity13 , 38 , and his four children @entity15 , 17 , @entity16 , 15 , @entity17 , 12 and eight - year - old @entity18 in @entity15 , @entity2			1
former @entity20 @entity19 officer @entity0 believes that @entity21 wants him to preach using both his @entity22 and an @entity9 semi-automatic assault rifle at his @entity2 church the married father - of - four is a senior pastor at the @entity1 in @entity2 , pictured , where he regularly preaches about @entity21 and guns @entity0 , left , alongside wife , @entity13 , @entity17 12 , eight - year - old @entity18 and @entity16 , are all fans of their various firearms , apart from eldest daughter @entity15 , not pictured of the four children , eldest daughter @entity15 has no interest in firearms			1
but her younger brother @entity16 is an @entity4 apprentice instructor			1
he owns his own @entity37 hunting rifles , a @entity39 870 20 gauge shogun , several @entity41 rifles and a @entity43 pistol			1
@entity17 , 12 , is the proud owner of a shotgun , while 8 - year - old @entity18 received a pink @entity45 .22 single shot rifle for her birthday			1
@entity0 , who is a former @entity48 officer has his own personal arsenal consisting of more than 20 weapons			1
the evangelical @entity51 owns three break - action shotguns , a @entity54 handgun as well as an ar - 15 rifle			1
the ar - 15 rifle is the ' civilian ' version of the @entity59 assault rifle used during the @entity60			2
the @entity9 , however , does not have a fully - automatic fire setting , despite this , it was able to kill effectively in the @entity65 and @entity66 theatre massacres			2
@entity0 said : ' a guided tour of the different firearms that i own , that would take a while			1
' a running joke is if you know how many firearms you own , you probably do n't own enough			0
' as well as a pastor , @entity0 is also a fully qualified firearms instructor with the @entity4 and enjoys passing his knowledge onto his family at the range @entity0 , left , holds the front of the @entity9 semi-automatic assault rifle steady for his son @entity16 while out in @entity2 , surrounded by hundreds of spent cartridges @entity0 , left , with daughter @entity17 , said the only way he would ever willingly give up his firearms was if @entity21 personally told him to do so and despite the @entity22 's ' turn the other cheek ' message , the 38 - year - old pastor says scripture clearly justifies the use of lethal force			1
@entity0 said : ' what fuels my passion for guns and self defense ? first and foremost my @entity51 faith			1
' i wish everyone got along , i wish that everybody was nice , but they 're not			0
and until we get into that perfect world where @entity21 comes again , we need to be able to protect ourselves and in @entity102 22:36 i believe @entity21 said " let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one "			2
' people ask me all the time , well what about peace on @entity109 and goodwill to all men ? absolutely true , i believe very strongly in what @entity112 says in chapter 12 , verse 18 - he says if possible as far as it depends on you be at peace with all people , and i 'm a peace lover , i 'm friendly if you meet me			2
' but you know what ? there are some people who wo n't be at peace with you			0
' and while the former @entity19 officer 's message may be controversial , his views go down well with his congregation			0
but as his wife @entity13 acknowledges , his love of guns has not been to the taste of all his fellow worshippers			0
the trainee midwife said : ' if they are against guns , very against guns , they 're probably not going to stay at our church for a long time			0
i will just honestly tell you that			0
' and there have been some people that have left because they do n't like his stance on guns , they do n't like it being brought up in church , they do n't like the fact that he 'd go out to shoot with fellow members of the church			2
' members of @entity0 's church have left his congregation because of his views on the use of firearms and the fact that he will go shooting with some of his flock as well as preaching in church , @entity0 runs a popular females with firearms facebook page and believes that women should be taught how to shoot properly @entity0 claims that while is in favour of ' @entity172 ' he acknowledges that not everyone is peaceful and it is necessary to be well prepared just in case alongside his @entity178 website , the preacher runs the popular females with firearms facebook page and is a big advocate of women learning how to shoot			1
' listen , i 'm a martial artist , i have a teaching rank in a derivative of @entity185 and i know that i am big enough that somebody who is 100lbs , i can bum rush you , i can get through your martial arts , pin you to the ground and beat you to death , ' he said			0
' i know i can , but you know what i ca n't do ? if you 've got a firearm , i ca n't get past that			0
that 's a force multiplying tool , especially if we have distance , so i think that 's why females especially should be taught self - defence , especially with the use of firearms , because they 're effective			2
' surprisingly , @entity0 and his wife were raised in @entity206 in @entity207 , which has fairly draconian firearms laws compared with @entity2			1
she said : ' i was extremely afraid of guns going into my teenage years , to the point that this sporting goods store i worked at when i was a teenager , i would not even touch the guns , i would n't bring them out to show anyone			0
' however , after her husband decided to buy a weapon for home defense , @entity13 resolved to conquer her fears and learn how to handle firearms properly			0
she added : ' now i feel very competent , i feel safe , i feel powerful , not in a " ha - ha , look at me i can shoot this gun and nobody can mess with me " way , but in a more protective , feel powerful against somebody that might try and hurt me sense			0
' @entity18 , 8 , holds her pink @entity230 rifle said ' i like shooting because it is fun			1
my friends at school think guns are really dangerous and we should never own a gun ' the @entity0 family with some of their arsenal of more than 20 firearms			1
according to the @entity243 , if you know exactly how many guns you own , you do n't have enough according to @entity0 , if the president @entity245 attempted to take away his firearms by removing the @entity247 , ' that would cease to be a legitimate government ' and @entity0 and his children regularly head out on hunting trips or to the gun range for a spot of target practice			1
eight - year - old @entity18 said : ' i like shooting guns because it 's fun			1
' my friends at school think guns are really dangerous and you should never own a gun			0
i think that it 's okay to own a gun as long as you know how to use it and when it 's okay to use it and where it 's okay to use it			0
' while high school shootings like @entity65 have created a backlash against gun ownership in parts of the @entity274 , they have made the pastor even more determined to pass on his gun skills to his young family			0
he said : ' if you look at the murderer , the rampage that happened at @entity65 , that young man murdered his mother to steal her firearms , to then transport them in the cause of a felony , which was another felony , took them on a school campus			0
' he murdered 25 more people - and when did he stop ? he stopped when the police cars pulled up , he took his own life because good men with guns were there to stop him , and as soon as they were , he stopped			2
' a rifle in the hands of a good man is good , a rifle in the hands of an evil man is evil			0
so what does @entity301 think of guns ? it 's just a tool			0
' @entity0 regularly takes members of his family on hunting trips using some of the wide array of firearms which he currently owns he said : ' i wish that everybody was nice , but they 're not			1
and until we get into that perfect world where @entity21 comes again , we need to be able to protect ourselves ' the couple both have a concealed carry permit , but the couple carefully restricts their children 's access to firearms and only lets them use them under careful supervision - while all guns are technically owned by @entity0			1
he added : ' the firearms in my house have about as much appeal and mystique to my children as the mop in the kitchen			0
it 's not something that 's taboo , it 's not something that 's off - limits			0
' unsurprisingly , the preacher is a firm believer in the @entity20 @entity338 's @entity247 - the right to bear arms			2
he said : ' how would i react if the state wanted to take away my firearms ? ' i do believe that a government of the @entity20 that tried to do that would cease to be a legitimate government			2
' but with guns still firmly legal in @entity2 , he will continue to spread his faith in @entity301 - and firearms - to his devoted flock			1
' you can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the @entity354 , or my ex-employees used to call me minister @entity356 but my first and foremost commitment is to @entity21 , ' he added			2
' if you said @entity0 , @entity21 came and said give up your firearms today and you can show me definitely it 's @entity21 , i 'd give em up , because my commitment to @entity21 comes first			1
' but i do n't think he does , i think he says " @entity0 , you 're a bearer of the image of @entity301 , so protect that			2
protect it in smart ways " , and firearms today are the best way to do that			0
' he said : ' you can kind of get to be this caricature where people call me the @entity354 , or my ex-employees used to call me minister malice '			0
