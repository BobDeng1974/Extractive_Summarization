@entity0 , the former home secretary , said @entity1 needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team @entity0 suggested last night that @entity4 should underplay the fact that @entity1 is their leader during the election			1
as doubts grow over mr @entity1 ’s stewardship of the party , the former home secretary said he needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team – and not to concentrate campaigning on him alone			1
‘ the offer is a @entity4 government , not a @entity4 presidency , ’ he said			1
and he suggested that mr @entity1 was not exciting , saying that former leader @entity17 had once told him : ‘ if you want excitement , go to the races			2
’ the suggestion that @entity4 should campaign for victory without drawing attention to their leader will not be seen as helpful to the beleagured mr @entity1			1
concern about his performance has dramatically deepened after @entity26 finished a close second – just 617 votes from victory – in thursday ’s by - election in the @entity4 heartland of @entity31 and @entity32			1
as doubts grow over his leadership , @entity1 will address a meeting of the @entity36 this afternoon			1
one mp said : ‘ he will face some tough questions			0
but there is such disillusionment in the party that many people might just not turn up			0
’ yesterday @entity42 was forced to deny that mr @entity1 will be ditched for a more popular leader before the election			1
she said in a tv interview that there would ‘ absolutely not ’ be a change of leader - and claimed there was no ‘ wobble in the ranks ’ of the @entity4 over his future			2
former @entity4 mp @entity54 became the first party figure to openly call for mr @entity1 to go - saying the beleaguered leader was a ‘ complete disaster ’ and should quit to ‘ make way for an election winner ’			1
mr @entity54 was the mp for the seat of @entity61 in @entity62 - which was a top target for @entity4 at the next election , but which @entity26 are now predicted to win amid deep concerns about immigration			1
the senior @entity67 said the party ’s performance in the @entity31 by - election was not that of a ‘ government in waiting ’ and described mr @entity1 ’s leadership as ‘ a complete disaster ’			1
as doubts grow over his leadership , @entity1 will address a meeting of the @entity36 this afternoon but @entity77 , the charismatic former postman who was home secretary under @entity78 , dashed the hopes of @entity80 who want to see him return as leader by ruling it out			1
mr @entity77 said he ‘ hated ’ being on the front bench in opposition – serving briefly as shadow chancellor - and said he had made it ‘ perfectly clear ’ to mr @entity1 that ‘ i left and i ’m not coming back			2
’ in an interview with the @entity88 , mr @entity0 said he was determined to do no harm to the @entity4 leadership			2
‘ i am doing and saying nothing that in any way would damage the chances of electing a @entity4 government , ’ he said			1
but , in comments which were seen as admitting there is an @entity1 problem , he said : ‘ there is no point in @entity1 being something he is not			2
new @entity26 mp @entity102 claims a @entity4 mp could be next to defect ‘ i think he needs to build on two strengths : one is the idea of having a conversation with people rather than performing in front of them in a kind of parade ; and secondly building a team , as he has been doing , so this is a team approach			1
‘ of course , led by him			0
but actually the offer is a @entity4 government , not a @entity4 presidency			1
’ he added : ‘ it is perfectly feasible for someone to have a different style of leadership and be able to deliver			0
‘ if people want something that is just a performance , then they will be taken in by @entity123			0
@entity17 once said to me , ‘ if you want excitement , go to the races			0
’ @entity26 ’s best ever result in a @entity4 - held seat , on the day they won their first mp from the @entity128 in @entity129 , has triggered criticism that @entity4 has failed to confront voters ’ concerns about immigration			1
it follows a lacklustre performance by mr @entity1 in the @entity137 referendum campaign , which had to be salvaged by @entity78 , and a widely panned party conference speech			2
miss @entity42 yesterday insisted : ‘ there is not a wobble in the ranks and nor should there be			0
‘ i think what is absolutely evident is that the anger and concern there is amongst people when they ’re being told that a recovery has arrived and yet they ’ re not getting better off and feeling disconnected from politics			0
‘ that is being picked up on by @entity26			0
‘ but actually @entity26 , although they ’re tapping into that sense of despair , they do n’t provide the answers			0
‘ it provides a very big responsibility on us as the @entity4 when people see the economy not delivering for them , they ’re worried about the health service , it is our responsibility to listen to those concerns and work together to make sure that we get rid of this government and address those concerns			2
’ another current mp @entity168 said the party could not stand up to the ‘ street fighting ’ skills of @entity123 and should never have come so close to losing a safe seat			0
mr @entity1 penned an article for a sunday newspaper setting out how he would deal with immigration , and saying people ’s concerns needed to be addressed			0
he reiterated his party ’s two policies on the issue – to somehow better control who is coming in and out of @entity184 ’s borders and to enforce the minimum wage so firms can not undercut @entity184 workers by hiring deeper foreign @entity4			0
yesterday @entity42 was forced to deny that mr @entity1 will be ditched for a more popular leader before the election miss @entity42 said mr @entity1 ’s article on immigration yesterday was ‘ about a new approach which is saying ‘ we do want to talk about immigration , we do have these policies , and that these will actually solve the problems ’ not just set out a number like the @entity128 did ’ , referring to the target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands which the coalition has failed to meet			2
but he faces another potential crisis in the coming months as @entity128 signalled they are determined to force a @entity204 vote on the issue of @entity207 votes for @entity207 laws			0
mr @entity1 has so far refused to accept @entity210 ’s suggestion for a divide , which would mean @entity4 ’s @entity212 would not be able to vote on @entity207 - only issues			1
but he faced criticism of this from former @entity4 home secretary @entity216 who said he could no longer avoid the issue , and must come up with proposals ‘ very quickly ’			1
he claimed mr @entity1 ’s stance on the issue – promising to hold a constitutional convention in a years ’ time was ‘ hopeless ’ and ‘ foolish ’ and suggested @entity4 did not care about @entity207			1
miss @entity42 denied the @entity4 was like a ‘ latte - sipping liberal north @entity222 intelligentsia ’ as put forward by one unnamed @entity4 mp			2
she told the @entity225 on @entity226 ( keep ) ‘ that is not the reality , that is not the @entity4			0
there are people like myself from professional middle - class backgrounds representing a seat in @entity222			0
but there are people representing the north east , labour mps from the north west , west midlands , from @entity240 and @entity137			0
‘ actually , we have people in the @entity4 from all walks of life , from all different backgrounds and from different parts of the country			0
and it ’s working together , that broad - based team that listens and understands all parts of the country			0
that is how we ’re going to make the way forward under @entity1 ’s leadership			2

he said : ' the offer is a @entity4 government , not a @entity4 presidency '
former home secretary *'s* comments may not be seen as helpful to @entity1
his leadership has been shaken by *narrow* victory over @entity26 in by - election
