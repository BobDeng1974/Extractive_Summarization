@entity0 , 35 , has two wombs and two vaginas due to a rare condition - but she has beaten the odds to give birth to a healthy son , @entity6 a woman with two wombs and two vaginas has spoken of her joy at finally giving birth to a ' miracle ' baby			1
@entity0 , 35 , was born with the incredibly rare medical condition uterus didelphys			1
only three per cent of women are born with such an abnormality - which can cause complications with pregnancy - and she suffered four miscarriages as a result			1
mrs @entity0 's chances of conception were halved because each of her wombs had just one fallopian tube and one ovary - which makes having a baby even more difficult			1
but after 14 years of trying to have a child with husband @entity29 , 41 , she conceived a healthy baby in one of her wombs			2
their son @entity6 was delivered by caesarean section on december 9 - weighing just 5lbs 9oz			1
his birth came after 12 months of serious health problems , in which mrs @entity0 nearly died and her husband battled depression			1
she had a stroke and was rushed to hospital with liver and kidney failure			1
mrs @entity0 , of @entity44 , @entity45 , said : ' @entity6 's birth was the most amazing , unbelievable feeling			1
' i still ca n't believe he 's mine , even now			2
' for 14 years we tried to have our own children and we never gave up hope			1
we 've been through so much to have him , but i never gave up hope			2
' always have faith and hope			0
despite everything i honestly believe that there 's always something good at the end of it			0
' ' it is just amazing - you forget about all the pain			0
i love being a mum			0
we are just enjoying every minute with @entity6			1
' doctors made the shocking discovery she had two wombs when investigating why mrs @entity0 was having difficulty conceiving			1
only one in 5 million women are said to be affected by the rare condition uterus didelphys			1
the condition is normally diagnosed during an examination , a smear test or in a scan during pregnancy			0
it occurs because in a female foetus , the uterus starts out as two small tubes			2
as the foetus develops , the tubes normally join to create one larger , hollow organ			0
@entity6 was delivered by caesarean section on december 9 - weighing just 5lbs 9oz			1
his parents @entity0 and @entity88 , 35 and 41 , had faced a battle to have their own child , after mrs @entity0 had suffered four miscarriages			1
the risk of miscarriage is increased in women with uterus didelphys however sometimes the tubes do n't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ - so the woman is born with two wombs			1
as in mrs @entity0 's case , sometimes women with the condition will have pregnancy complications because each uterus can be smaller than normal			1
although mrs @entity0 has two vaginas , she has sex normally but becomes pregnant in one uterus			1
had she given birth naturally , it would have been through the vagina attached to that uterus , dr @entity113 , a consultant gynaecologist & obstetrician at @entity115 , told @entity116			1
however , caesarean sections are usually recommended in these women , to reduce the risk of complications			2
mr and mrs @entity0 had always wanted children since meeting at work in 2000			1
but after a year of trying with no success , the perplexed couple sought medical advice			2
uterus didelphys , also known as a double uterus , is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus , to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas , though this is not always the case			1
it occurs because in a female foetus , the uterus starts out as two small tubes			2
as the foetus develops , the tubes normally join to create one larger , hollow organ — the uterus			2
sometimes the tubes do n't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs			2
it often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan			0
in terms of physical anatomy , the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit , though they can be as big as a ' normal ' womb			0
uterus didelphys , also known as a double uterus , is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus , to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas , though this is not always the case it also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb			1
some women are also born with two vaginas , although they can have sex and menstruate in the same way as people with just one			1
' they may know they have two and be able to find them , or they may not realise , ' dr @entity113 , a consultant gynaecologist & @entity175 at @entity176 , told @entity116			0
' it can be painful because there are two squashed in the same area , so sometimes we do an operation to join them together , but its not necessary			0
' they could also have abnormalities of their kidneys and the tube which bring the urine from the bladder			0
' women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage , premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy			2
often caesarean sections are recommended , to reduce the risk of complications			0
there is no treatment or cure for the condition			0
mrs @entity0 , who at that stage weighed 19 stone , was told by her doctor to slim down - and she dropped more than 10 stone in two years			1
but concerned doctors also examined her uterus - and made the discovery of her double womb , cervix and vagina			2
she said : ' they told me i had a rare condition that meant my womb had split in two while i was in my mother 's womb			0
' as a result , i have two wombs , two cervixes and two vaginas			0
' but i never had any idea			0
all i could think was would i ever have a family ?			0
' the couple married in 2003 , still hoping they would one day become parents			0
then , in 2006 , mrs @entity0 endured a year of terrible ill - health			1
she suffered a mini-stroke in the may , her first miscarriage in the august and was diagnosed with epilepsy in the october			2
mrs @entity0 said : ' talking now about that year , it seems a bad year , but we just got through it			1
' my family were amazing , i could n't have done it without their support			0
' that first miscarriage happened very early , i was only about six weeks pregnant			2
we had n't even the time to get excited or be that happy			2
' but it was reassuring to know that we had fallen pregnant naturally			2
' the next few years revolved around ovulation , conception and timings			0
despite @entity244 , the couple endured the heartbreak of three further miscarriages between 2009 and 2011			2
after the last miscarriage , mrs @entity0 was referred to a specialist to see whether it would be possible to connect her two wombs , in the hope that it would help her carry a baby to full term			1
the stress and heartache of their losses weighed heavily on her husband , too			0
' my mother had passed away just before we lost the baby and i fell into a depression , ' said mr @entity88			0
' i was off work for three months			0
' determined to help her husband , mrs @entity0 made it her mission to put him first			1
' i made it my mission to get @entity29 well again and back to work			0
' i always encouraged him and finally he was able to go back part - time and build his hours back up			1
' the couple then began to consider fostering			0
' i kept saying that even if we had our own children i would like to foster , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' so we went through the process , which was long and hard , and finally in may 2013 a seven - year - old boy came to live with us			1
' having children was the last thing on her mind - and in september that year she nearly lost her life			2
she began to have cold sweats and hallucinations ; her temperature plummeted to @entity285 and she became hypothermic			0
she was rushed to hospital and slipped in and out of consciousness for the next eight hours			0
the doctors called her family to the hospital as her organs began to fail			0
mrs @entity0 spent a month in hospital recovering what doctors diagnosed as ischemic hepatitis - acute liver failure - caused by low blood pressure and dehydration - before she was flown back home to @entity45			1
the fourth miscarriage sent mr @entity88 ( left ) into a depression in which he needed three months off work and mrs @entity0 ( right ) forgot all about conceiving while supporting her husband to become well again			1
so when she fell pregnant for a fifth time and gave birth to @entity6 ( centre ) , the couple were over the moon as she recovered , the couple did not talk about conceiving - but she admitted that it was always in the back of her mind			1
and six months later mrs @entity0 became pregnant naturally			1
' i could n't believe it when it was positive , ' she said			0
' our obstetrician was amazing and saw us every week for the first 12 weeks			0
' getting to that milestone was a first for us and then we focused on 14 weeks			0
they then put a stitch in my cervix			0
' at the 20 - week scan , the thrilled couple were told they were having a boy			0
but the pregnancy was not straightforward and a month later , mrs @entity0 was given steroid injections for the baby 's lungs in case it was born early			1
' nobody knew when i was going to have the baby because of the half womb , ' she said			0
' i had to take it really easy , just in case anything would happen			0
' i was so nervous throughout the whole pregnancy and had to inject an anti-clotting medicine every day , ' she said			0
however , having a son made all the worry worthwhile , as she and her husband – and their entire extended family – are overjoyed			2
she said : ' i never thought my dad would get to see my children but on saturday we christened @entity6 and the priest who baptised him was the same priest who married my parents 37 years ago			1
