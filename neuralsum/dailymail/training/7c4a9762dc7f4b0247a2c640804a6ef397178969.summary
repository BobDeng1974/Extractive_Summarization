like any proud @entity1 , they wanted to celebrate @entity2			0
but when these friends arrived at @entity5 in national costume , the celebrations came to an abrupt end			2
their outfits of tall black hats , red skirts and white aprons apparently did n’t meet the dress code of the exclusive @entity14 store			1
the @entity16 women were celebrating @entity2 in @entity14 , but were refused entry to top department store @entity5 because of their traditional dress out for a fun time : the group said they were smartly dressed and well behaved on their national day a uniformed woman security officer told them : ‘ you ca n’t come in here dressed like that			1
’ the group , including a doctor , an @entity30 manager , a lawyer and a fashion designer , had spent £ 200 on their traditional costumes to make sure march 1 – the day the @entity16 honour their patron saint @entity34 – was one to remember			1
they were on a weekend theatre trip to @entity14 from their homes in @entity39 , @entity40 , and a trip to the @entity5 champagne bar was on their itinerary			2
yesterday @entity5 apologised for the blunder , and pointed out that the women were allowed in after security checks			1
the six travelled from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity14 for a theatre break weekend - and said everyone enjoyed their festive costumes it was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that the store backed down trip organiser @entity54 , 56 , said : ‘ we were gobsmacked – we were smartly dressed and well behaved on our national day			1
‘ the first woman security officer who stopped us was quite rude and just said we could not enter the store because we were in our national costume			1
as we stood there an @entity62 woman in a sari and an @entity65 woman in lovely colourful robes both entered the store without a problem			0
‘ everywhere we went people were happy to see us and wanted their photographs taken with us , until we got to @entity5 where we were shocked by the way the staff treated us			0
’ the women were eventually let in but say they were shocked by the way they were treated it was only when the women protested that they were being racially discriminated against that staff backed down			0
knitwear designer @entity78 , 50 , said : ‘ i could n’t believe it – would they stop a @entity81 from entering @entity5 in his kilt ? i do n’t think so			0
’ @entity5 yesterday apologised , saying it was a misunderstanding			0
‘ the security guard asked for the group to wait while she double - checked it was in keeping with our dress code , ’ a spokesman said			1
‘ the women did n’t want to wait and went to another entrance where they were admitted , as by that time the security team were aware they were wearing national dress			2
‘ we certainly did not deny them entry and always welcome all visitors in national costume			0
we apologise for any confusion			0
’ @entity5 today apologised saying it was a misunderstanding and the women from @entity16 were welcome			2

security officer thought costumes *clashed* with store *'s* dress code
group , including doctor and lawyer , wore tall black hats and white aprons
@entity5 apologises for blunder and women allowed in after security checks
