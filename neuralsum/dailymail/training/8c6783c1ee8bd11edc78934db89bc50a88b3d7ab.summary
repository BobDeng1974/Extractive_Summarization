@entity9 , who had a rare form of nasal cancer diagnosed in may , has continued taking part in practices and competitions with her squad			1
and , when her team heard about a fundraiser to take part in a @entity20 game , she helped them raise more than $ 2,500 in one weekend			1
determined : six - year - old @entity9 and her cheerleading squad have been raising money for cancer research ' she is tougher than any guy i know , ' @entity25 said of his daughter @entity9 , who wears a headband emblazoned with the slogan ' fights like a girl '			1
since finding out she has a type of cancer called @entity36 , @entity9 has had to have radiation treatments , but she was always ready for cheerleading practice			1
' we practice three , four times a week ... they are little girls			0
they get tired , ' assistant coach @entity43 said			0
' a lot of times [ @entity9 comes ] straight from radiation treatment , ' ms @entity43 said , telling 7 news that she ' never has a single complaint '			2

every $ 1,000 brought in is another chance to have the squad 's name added into the draw			0
' it is very overwhelming			0
there is a lot of people over here			0
way more than we originally expected , ' @entity9 's mother , @entity104 , said			0
