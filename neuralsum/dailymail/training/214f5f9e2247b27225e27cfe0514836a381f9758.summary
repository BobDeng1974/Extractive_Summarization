@entity0 should be on the @entity2 plane to @entity3 to give @entity4 an edge from the penalty spot and also provide a @entity7 in support of @entity9 , according to former captain @entity10			1
three @entity12 boss @entity11 is set to name his squad for the finals on monday following the end to the @entity17 season			2
although @entity9 will miss the chance to come up against @entity21 forward @entity0 at @entity23 's on sunday because of a minor groin problem , the @entity19 striker is expected to once again lead @entity4 's attack on the big stage this summer			1
frontman : @entity10 says @entity0 ( centre ) should be in @entity4 's @entity2 squad just who will offer support remains to be seen - with the likes of @entity19 team - mate @entity33 and @entity34 forward @entity35 also in the frame , while @entity38 frontman @entity37 could offer another choice as would @entity40 , now playing in the @entity41 with @entity42			1
however , @entity10 - who spearheaded a formidable front partnership with @entity44 in the run to the semi-finals of @entity47 and also played at the 199 @entity2 - believes @entity0 would provide a cool head were the dreaded penalty shoot - out to stand the way of @entity4 's progress once more this summer			1
' one of the reasons i would take @entity0 is for that eventuality - how important have penalties been for @entity4 at major tournaments in the last 25 years ? ' said @entity10 , who will be in @entity3 as part of the @entity60 's @entity2 coverage			1
support act : @entity35 ( left ) and @entity33 are in the frame to play alongside @entity9 ' @entity0 's record from penalties for @entity21 is amazing , but i would take him to @entity3 on merit for his overall contribution			2
' to have him on your team , knowing that if it goes to a shoot - out he is a virtual banker , is a great feeling for a coach			0
' in open play , if we are struggling to score , he is a great option to have - he came on and scored with his first touch in international football against @entity79 at @entity80 , and that is a decent knack to have			0
prolific : @entity0 ( left ) has never missed a penalty for @entity21 , scoring 34 out of 34 ' my four picks as forwards would be @entity9 , @entity35 , @entity33 and @entity0			0
' you do n't need to play for one of the top four to get a game for @entity4 now - look at all the @entity21 players who are in contention			0
' @entity10 believes a sense of realism might actually allow @entity4 to play with a freedom when for once the expectations of a nation will not weigh heavy on the ' @entity96 '			1
' i am sick of us coming away from a @entity2 , after so many of our players have had great seasons for their clubs , wondering why @entity4 have not done themselves justice , ' he said			0
@entity3 - bound : @entity10 ( left ) is part of the @entity60 's television team for the @entity2 this summer ' this time , i do n't think many people expect us to do well , and that might work in our favour			2
' i just wish an @entity4 side could come home from a big tournament and say , truthfully , they gave every last drop			0
' it would be great to see ( @entity116 ) @entity115 or @entity117 have a great @entity2 , something where we could see we are on the right track , people at home will accept that			0
