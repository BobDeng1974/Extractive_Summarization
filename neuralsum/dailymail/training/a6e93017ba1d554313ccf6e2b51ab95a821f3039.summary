by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 07:43 est , 30 july 2012 the death of @entity3 's liberation hero @entity2 could have been hastened by arsenic and blister beetle venom , according to a fresh post-mortem to mark his 229th birthday			1
the findings come after @entity11 president @entity10 ordered the 19th century revolutionary leader 's bones exhumed and examined to test his theory that @entity2 was assassinated			1
it was announced as @entity10 and a group of schoolchildren unveiled a new 3d image of @entity2 , which a team of researchers produced based on studies of @entity2 's remains			1
national hero : @entity11 's president @entity10 unveils a photograph - like portrait of @entity11 's independence hero @entity2 on the 229th anniversary of @entity2 's birth the socialist leader reveres @entity2 and has wrapped his left - wing reforms in the imagery and language of the region 's battle to break free of colonial power @entity36			1
' he was a true giant of the human cause , the human battle ... this is his face , ' @entity10 said , sitting below two giant prints of a life - like depiction of a distinguished - looking @entity2 boasting a gold - braided uniform and prominent sideburns			1
' now we know with precision and receive with infinite intensity the luminous presence of this gaze , this living face			0
' the big reveal did not offer much in the way of surprise			0
with his high forehead and aquiline nose , the latest image shows that contemporary artists got @entity2 's face pretty much right			1
@entity2 is a figure of reverence in @entity62 , where he helped to free @entity11 , @entity64 , @entity65 and , of course , @entity67 from the @entity36 colonial yoke			1
but in his 13 years as @entity11 president , @entity10 has strived to turn @entity11 - born @entity2 into a cult figure			1
one of his first acts on becoming president in 1999 was to push through a new constitution that changed the country 's name to @entity76 of @entity11			0
since then @entity10 has normally given televised speeches in front of large paintings of @entity2 , a brilliant soldier and military tactician who led independence forces against the @entity36 across the region , and ordered a striking new mausoleum built for @entity2 's remains , which will be finished soon			1
revolutionary figure : @entity10 and a group of schoolchildren unveiled a new 3d image of @entity2 , which a team of researchers produced based on studies of @entity2 's remains @entity11 's opposition accuses the president of cynically seeking to boost his popularity by linking himself to @entity2			1
right - wingers accuse @entity10 of being an autocrat who carefully avoids quoting some of @entity2 's words on freedom and rights			2
@entity10 denies it and cites @entity2 as the inspiration for his leftist policies			2
he has long suggested @entity2 was poisoned by enemies in @entity64 , rejecting the more common version cited by historians that he died of tuberculosis there in 1830 , aged just 47			1
two years ago , amid unusual scenes of a military honour guard in white biohazard suits and face masks exhuming the remains during a pre-dawn ceremony at the @entity117 , the president assigned a team to investigate @entity2 's death			2
revered : @entity2 helped to free @entity11 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity67 from @entity36 colonial rule but died aged just 47 in 1830 a year ago , it reported back that ' the @entity122 ' may have died of accidental poisoning - probably as a result of taking toxic medicines that were widely used at the time			1
they did not rule out tuberculosis			0
on tuesday , scientists said they did not find any evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis , the @entity132 reported , but they warned that the samples were degraded and findings inconclusive			2
the investigation did however turn up traces of arsenic and venom from lytta vesicatoria , or blister beetle , according to @entity140 , one of the medical researchers			0
both were common remedies for respiratory illnesses at the time , she added			1
nevertheless , @entity10 has not abandoned his theory that @entity2 was murdered by enemies loyal to the @entity36 throne			2
after the scientist heading the 3d image project explained how it had been created using multiple scans and the latest forensic facial reconstruction methods , @entity10 said @entity11 were jubilant to see @entity2 's ' real face ' at last			1
' and not just in @entity11 , but in all the countries of @entity62 , the @entity157 and further afield , ' he said			0
' i believe @entity2 is born again every day in every one of us , in these people , in these children ... in the fight for the fatherland which never ends			2
' a few blocks away from the @entity168 presidential palace , a crowd of red - clad @entity10 supporters cheered and sang happy birthday as two giant canvases bearing the picture were unfurled on the face of a grand theatre			0
the new picture and birth certificate are not the only events to mark @entity2 's birthday			2
the @entity11 government also hopes to soon inaugurate a long - delayed new mausoleum for the independence hero			0
the towering 160ft white structure in downtown @entity182 is not quite yet finished , but it will soon be the resting place for the bones of @entity2 , which since 1876 had been kept along with those of another 100 @entity11 national heroes and heroines in the adjacent @entity117			2
its construction has been delayed , shrouded in secrecy and alternately hailed as fit for a hero of @entity2 's historical grandeur and criticised as an exaggerated reflection of @entity10 's own ego			1
its solemn black granite - floored interior is ready , but the surrounding plaza is not			0
workers have been toiling day and night in recent weeks , laying patio tiles , wiring lamps , landscaping and molding concrete steps			0
@entity10 shows the pistols of independence hero @entity2 during a ceremony to mark the his birthday critics have called the expensive memorial , thought to have cost more than Â£ 74million , a waste of money , while some critics have likened its sloping walls to a skate park and said it denigrates the @entity117			1
but others believe @entity11 deserve a towering monument			0
' i do n't think it 's exaggerated at all , ' said @entity217 , a 47 - year - old housewife from the west - central town of @entity219 as she admired it from her car			0
' the @entity221 , although spectacular , had become pretty small as the city grew			0
' @entity223 , a historian and leading expert on @entity2 , considers the mausoleum @entity10 's way of deepening his own identification in people 's minds with the national hero			1
' the political intent is that president @entity10 be proclaimed the agent of @entity2 's will and interpreter of the gospel of @entity2 , ' he said			0
' this monument will tie together both figures , ' he said , ' and will not just be the mausoleum of @entity2 but also the entrance of president @entity10 into the pantheon of patriots			0
' adulation of @entity2 transcends both sides of @entity11 's polarized pre-vote politics			0
@entity10 's election rival , state governor @entity247 , began tuesday by tweeting a string of inspirational @entity2 quotes from his @ hcapriles account			0
but in a speech later that day , he said : ' this government prefers to build a mausoleum to the liberator rather than honor his memory , ' the best way to honor his legacy is solving the problems of the nation			0
