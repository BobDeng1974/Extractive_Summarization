@entity0 was ridiculed yesterday after laying a wreath honouring the @entity2 dead with a scruffy message that read : ' from the @entity4 '			1
the note , scrawled with a black marker by an organiser , was left at the @entity8 in @entity9 yesterday and has been branded ' pathetic ' and ' distasteful '			2
but the @entity11 's team say he was denied the chance to write his own message and was only handed the wreath moments before he put it down			1
we must never forget ' and was signed personally by the prime minister			0
the @entity37 also wrote his own note , which said : ' in everlasting memory , @entity39 '			0
@entity41 also put down a wreath with a note in the same handwriting , which only said : ' from the deputy prime minister '			2
the incident has led to a row online with some calling mr @entity0 ' pathetic ' and others claiming he had been ' stitched up '			0
@entity49 wrote : ' i think @entity0 's message on the wreath is pathetic			1
he could n't even be bothered to write his own name '			0
@entity54 said ' he must have put a lot of thought into that tribute '			0
defence : @entity11 supporters say that mr @entity0 has been ' stitched up ' over the incident similar : the wreath put down by @entity41 also had a note containing his job title this tribute from the people of @entity66 was also written in the same black marker commemorations : prince @entity39 , @entity20 , @entity41 and @entity0 were taking part in a series of events being held 100 years to the day after the start of the @entity2 others , including former @entity75 mp @entity74 , compared the incident to accusations former @entity11 leader @entity78 wore a donkey jacket at the @entity8 on @entity80 in 1981			1
mr @entity78 denied the claims and said the coat was an expensive gift from his wife			0
ms @entity74 added : ' i am stunned by @entity0 's @entity2 centenary wreath message , which is arrogant , disrespectful and just plain rude			1
' @entity88 's former spin doctor @entity87 said in a blog post : ' did @entity0 ’s team really forget to have that conversation with the ceremony organisers ? ' was the first any of them knew about the message on the wreath really when it was handed to their leader 30 seconds before he had lay it			1
and is their operation really as lacklustre and resigned to their fate as @entity41 ’s , who did the same thing ? upset : @entity105 users have ridiculed the @entity11 for the message left at the @entity8 leaving : @entity107 ( left ) departs after attending a service of commemoration at @entity110 in @entity110 , @entity111 act of remembrance : prince @entity113 , @entity113 attends a service of commemoration at @entity116 in @entity117 ' or is it a more serious problem : that the fear of being the first to screw up after @entity0 ’s image speech means even the most effective staffers are scared to do their jobs properly , especially on an issue as sensitive as commemorating the war dead ? ' mr @entity0 's supporters said this afternoon any criticism was unfair			1
a source told @entity128 it was a government - organised ceremony and ' @entity0 was handed the wreath seconds before and had not chance to write his own @entity133 was essentially a label being used by the organisers to give him the right wreath '			2
a @entity11 spokesman added : ‘ we were very disappointed that @entity0 was not given the chance to write a personal message			2
’ a source close to @entity41 said : ' the option of hand signing was not one we were ever given			0
