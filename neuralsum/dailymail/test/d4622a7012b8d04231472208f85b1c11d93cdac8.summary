a little boy with autism has sent his toy bear on a round - the - world mission to help him raise awareness about the disability			1
in january 2013 , @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure , having been inspired by the story of a cancer - stricken girl who , unable to live her own dreams of world travel , sent her teddy bear in her place			1
hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition , @entity6 decided to send his @entity22 bear , called @entity23 , out into the world , carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism			1
now , the bear has circled the globe and then some , continuing to share his vital message , while inviting the world to join in with his journey online			1
' when i first decided to support @entity6 in his campaign , it was because i was happy to see him want to “ pay it forward ” ' @entity39 tells @entity53			2
' i fundraise each year to pay the $ 24,500.00/year tuition it costs for @entity6 to go to a special needs school			2
i was thrilled to support @entity23 because @entity6 had found a way to give back to our community ; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts			1
' hello , my name is @entity65			0
i have autism , and so does my pet polar bear @entity23			1
@entity23 is about to go traveling on an adventure ; and i need you to take care of him			2
my polar bear wants to raise autism awareness			1
just call him ' tikko the @entity74 ' or ' @entity75 '			0
guess what , this guy is much more different than the other polar bears you know			0
things you should look out for : to accompany @entity23 the autistic bear on his adventures , @entity6 included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism – using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like			1
each family who receivedtikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community – helping to spread @entity6 ’s message across the globe , while he remained at home in @entity102			1
but the mother and son could never have known what a phenomenon @entity23 would become			2
' in january when @entity23 took his first trip to @entity109 , i connected with another mom there whose child had autism , ' @entity39 explains			1
' there was little to no support for autism in @entity109			0
' hearing such a story from so far away , @entity39 began to research autism in the other countries @entity23 was visiting , and she shared what she learned on the campaign 's facebook page			1
and two weeks after the @entity23 had begun his adventures , @entity39 became involved in coordinating them			2
after media attention grew , and demand for visits from @entity128 increased , @entity39 received a donation of new @entity130 from toy company @entity131 , who offered 600 bears to the cause in order to help the family cope with the overwhelming amount of interest			0
‘ for the first few months there was only one @entity23 , ’ @entity39 explained			2
‘ it was n’t long before we realized we could reach people faster by having more @entity23 ’s available			2
so i wrote to @entity131 ( the maker of the @entity143 ) , and to date they have donated 600 polar bears to us ! ’ with so many @entity128 bears in the mix , running the campaign became a full - time job for @entity39			0
at the gate : @entity23 made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling a towering success : the little bear has made it to some of the world 's most instantly - recognizable landmarks she keeps supporters informed with daily updates on @entity23 's location on @entity162 and @entity163 , receives new @entity75 travel photos every day , and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites			1
however , @entity39 says : ' no matter how busy i am , i always have time to listen and offer support to those dealing with the challenges of having a child on the spectrum			0
' @entity23 's @entity162 page documents every destination he has reached in dozens of photos			2
he 's posed at some of the world 's most famous landmarks , hobnobbed with a-list celebrities , and even scraped the skies in a daring aerial show , all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his t - shirt : ' autism … it ’s okay to be different ! ' the campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism , not in the least the young boy who started it all			1
a message in motion : @entity23 spreads awareness with his motto : ' autism … it ’s okay to be different ! ' getting back to his roots : @entity23 has even made it as far as the @entity200 , which was a dream of owner @entity6 ' @entity6 feels a sense of purpose , ' says mom @entity39			1
' he feels he is not only helping the world , but also his school peers			0
he ’s gained confidence , and he ’s made & kept friends more easily			0
' he ’s matured a great deal since starting his campaign			0
it has also brought us closer together – we share a very special bond			0
' today there are still 20 @entity214 on the go , and the work is far from over			0
' @entity23 is still travelling , and will be for many years to come ! ' says @entity39			0
' he is just back from @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
he ’s currently in @entity221			0
' @entity128 is on the set of the @entity223 's @entity224 is packed and ready to visit @entity225 in @entity226			0
@entity23 is one busy bear ! '			1

@entity6 , 11 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , sends his *stuffed* polar bear @entity23 to other children around the world
each child who looks after @entity23 is *tasked* with raising awareness about autism in his or her community
