on monday the likes of @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 enjoyed kickabouts with kids in schools across @entity7 for @entity9 's admirable foundation			1
across the city , @entity10 and @entity11 were facing the world 's media ahead of tuesday 's @entity16 visit of @entity17			1
things have changed in these parts with the blue half seemingly in the ascendency after decades of red dominance			0
here , @entity23 examines whether @entity24 are now a bigger club than @entity9 ... @entity25 striker @entity3 shows off his dribbling during a school visit on monday @entity24 midfielder @entity11 ( left ) shares a joke with manager @entity10 on monday recent history @entity24 undoubtedly hold the upper hand			1
two @entity32 titles in three years have been greeted deliriously by the previously success - starved blue half of @entity7			1
this year they are locked in a two - horse race with @entity36 , with @entity9 lagging behind in the chasing pack as the home straight looms large			1
the noisy neighbours have cranked up the volume to 11 and it appears to be stuck there			0
getting past @entity17 in the @entity16 will see them hit the next level on their upwards trajectory			1
the @entity24 squad trained ahead of their @entity16 clash with @entity17 on tuesday @entity47 and @entity48 visited a school as @entity9 enjoyed time off with no @entity51 commitments @entity9 , on the other hand , are facing a fight to avoid a second season without @entity16 football			1
currently in fourth , @entity57 's men have a season - defining run - in with a resurgent @entity59 breathing down their necks			0
the @entity61 has a track record that can not be questioned and should be judged after next season , but at the moment they are lagging behind their cross-town rivals			0
@entity67 not even a contest			0
@entity9 's haul of trophies and @entity24 's barren decades make for some lopsided scorelines			1
top - flight titles ? that 'll be 20 to four			2
@entity74 ? three to none			0
@entity76 ? 11 to five			0
@entity77 sang ' the past was yours but the future 's mine , ' in @entity80 and @entity24 fans believe this so firmly they had the lyrics put on a banner			1
@entity24 celebrate winning the @entity32 last season - their second title in three years @entity9 celebrate winning the 2008 @entity16 - their third @entity51 title overall @entity88 @entity9 's summer frenzy had many wondering if @entity90 had gone on location to film a one - off @entity92 at @entity93			1
@entity94 , keen not to leave his new manager without stock , waltzed down the transfer aisle , lobbing the likes of @entity3 and @entity47 into his red trolley as the clock ticked towards deadline			0
there will be no repeat this summer with targets already identified and work underway			0
this is an approach akin to that now used at @entity24 , who these days tend to do their business quickly and , where possible , under the radar			1
@entity111 sanctions , which the club still believe were unjustified , have stopped them from widening the gap even further			0
squad again , @entity24 have the upper hand			1
as @entity117 continues to search for the right formula @entity24 's old guard is again clicking into gear			1
@entity10 has two quality players vying for each position			0
the spine of his team , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 would appear to be going nowhere			2
city have a strong squad that has been improved over a few seasons , leaving them in second in the league an indication of how much things have changed came in the season 's first derby , when @entity24 fans drfited away from the @entity139 a little deflated after a 1 - 0 win that , only a few years ago , would have been deliriously received			1
turnover often used to measure club size , @entity24 turned over a record £ 347million last year which they believe will rise again this time around			1
executives are confident that for the first time since their @entity149 takeover , the club will post a profit			0
commercial income was £ 166m , by far a club record , and more partnerships have since been announced			0
across town , however , @entity9 remain ahead			1
last year , they turned over a record £ 433.2m and made a profit of £ 23.9m			0
their commercial intake was £ 189.3m			0
@entity3 poses outside @entity9 's sponsored training ground at @entity158 this time around the club have forecast that , thanks mainly to the impact of no @entity16 football , turnover will drop below £ 400m			1
it could mean that , for the first time in living memory , @entity24 's turnover is more than that of their rivals			1
that said , @entity9 's record kit deal with adidas and rapidly expanding commercial machine should see a sharp swelling in the @entity93 coffers in 2015 - 16			2
officials remain relaxed about the large chunk of @entity180 debt that remains ( £ 380.5m )			0
@entity181 domestically and internationally @entity9 continue to lead the way			2
they regularly attract crowds of 75,000 to @entity93 - around 30,000 more than @entity24 get at the @entity139			2
that gap is expected to narrow when @entity24 complete the first phase of their stadium expansion which will see capacity rise above 55,000			2
a recent survey commissioned by @entity24 executives claimed that their global fanbase had expanded at the astonishing rate of 500 per cent in just three years			1
@entity2 and his team - mates regularly play in front of 75,000 supporters during home games city have plans in place to expand the capacity of the @entity139 to 55,000 the same figures claimed the club now had 37.97m followers across the world			2
that is dwarfed by the figure @entity9 famously use , which states that they have 659m supporters on the planet			2
this area is hard to measure			0
@entity94 recently pointed out in a call to investors , however , that four of the top five @entity214 soccer audiences were for @entity9 matches			2
@entity24 will no doubt take solace that their recent 1 - 1 draw with @entity36 attracted 1.34m viewers stateside , a rise of 316 per cent from the 324,000 who watched the same fixture in 2010			2
infrastructure it might not seem like it , with more than £ 1.15bn spent in six years , but from the start @entity24 's @entity149 ownership wanted to make the club a sustainable model			1
a big part of that process was getting the infrastructure right			0
when the new owners arrived they were stunned to find an ill - equipped training ground and a @entity32 club with no @entity236 department or chief finance officer			2
under the guidance of chairman @entity241 , the transformation on the pitch has been mirrored by that off it			0
the £ 200m @entity244 is one of the finest facilities in world football while the number of staff at the club dwarfs what it was just over half a decade ago			0
add to that sister clubs in @entity253 and @entity254 and @entity24 appear well - equipped for an assault on global domination			2
@entity9 's @entity158 training ground , pictured in 2006 , is being changed by @entity117 an aerial view of the @entity24 's new football academy which was launched in december last year at the last count , @entity9 had a @entity261 of 837 full - time staff			1
many of those are based in their @entity265 office			0
when it comes to capitalising on the @entity32 's global appeal , @entity9 are second to none and got a head start on many of their rivals			1
while @entity158 is world class , @entity117 ordered a number of renovations shortly after his arrival which should stand them in good stead			0
the club 's academy continues to churn out footballers but , given the changing nature of the game , the success of the class of ' 92 may never be repeated			0
conclusion @entity9 remain the biggest club and should do so for the foreseeable future			2
that is not to say that the gap has not been substantially narrowed			0
the longer @entity24 remain the dominant force on the field the more danger @entity9 will find themselves in of one day being overtaken			1
many more seasons without @entity16 football could have a dramatic impact			1
for generations , with @entity24 a laughing stock , @entity9 considered @entity59 their main rivals			1
some will stubbornly say that will never change			0
it already has , both on the field and off it .			0

@entity24 have won two @entity32 titles in three years
@entity9 face a battle to qualify for the @entity16
city have become one of the best teams in @entity307 in the last few seasons
