the multi-millionaire banker scooped £ 68,340 prize money after his horse romped home in the @entity13 ’ @entity14 ahead of favourite @entity16			1
@entity8 is one of 11 horses the @entity3 head of investment banking has competing in the festival , including the even more provocatively named @entity22			1
the name is believed to be a mocking reference to a 2011 newspaper article about mr @entity2 headlined ‘ who ’s the fat cat in the hat ? the rich world of @entity2			0
’ mr @entity2 , who was not at @entity5 yesterday but is expected later in the week , is a hugely divisive figure who helped run the @entity3 investment bank while traders bragged about manipulating @entity34 interest rates , which led to the bank being fined £ 290 million			1
critics see him as the epitome of the aggressive ‘ casino ’ culture under former @entity3 boss @entity40			0
@entity42 mp @entity41 denounced the banker ’s appearance at the @entity5 as an ‘ insult ’ to every taxpayer and small business in the country			0
he added : ' it shows just how out of touch these bankers are			0
’ @entity52 born mr @entity2 is worth £ 57m according to the @entity54 rich list			2
he cashed in £ 9.7million of shares bonuses last year , earned £ 44million of pay and perks in 2010 and is set to pocket up to £ 6million in deferred shares bonuses this year			0
with his 49 - year - old @entity60 wife , @entity59 , he owns 30 horses with @entity63 ’s champion trainer @entity62 thoroughbreds have won £ 588,125 in prize money this season			1
winning the race : banker @entity2 , who is worth an estimated £ 57 million has a total of 11 horses competing at @entity5 this year ( file photo ) taking the lead : @entity8 , in the lead , won the first race of the @entity5 yesterday , making an already rich @entity2 richer top horse : @entity76 riding @entity2 's @entity8 to victory in the @entity78 ahead of favourite my tent or yours yesterday last month , it emerged that mr @entity2 and four other bosses at @entity3 would share a jackpot worth up to £ 17million despite being tainted by a string of scandals			1
the awards were dubbed ‘ unjustifiable ’ and poorly - timed , as @entity3 tries to rebuild its reputation in the wake of the @entity34 interest rate - rigging scandal			0
last december mr @entity2 spearheaded a review of ethics and operations at @entity3 aimed at regaining trust after its reputation after the @entity97 catastrophe			2
as part of it , he imposed what he called a ‘ tabloid test ’ and wants to outlaw activities that would look bad if they appeared in the newspapers			0
but there will no doubt be widespread sympathy for mr @entity2 after another of his horses , @entity109 , lost the festival ’s @entity110 meaning he left without the race ’s £ 85,425 prize money .			2
