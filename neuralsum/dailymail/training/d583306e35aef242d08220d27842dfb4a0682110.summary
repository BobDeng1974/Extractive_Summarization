the proposed overhaul of the benefits system could save @entity12 £ 500million a year in sickness payments			2
‘ too many people are stuck on sickness benefits because of issues that could be addressed but instead are not , ’ he will say			1
‘ some have drug or alcohol problems but refuse treatment			0
in other cases , people have problems with their weight that could be addressed – but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice			0
it is not fair to ask hard - working taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who refuse to accept the support and treatment that could help them get back to a life of work			2

’ mr @entity0 will say that the next @entity28 government is determined to ensure ‘ that the hardest to help ’ receive the support they need to improve their lives			1
‘ that is why i have asked professor dame @entity84 to undertake a rapid review into how best to support those suffering from long - term yet treatable conditions back into work			1
