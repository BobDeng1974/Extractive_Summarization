fightback : defence minister @entity1 denied using the c - word and threatened to sue the @entity3 it was supposed to be a warts and all documentary showing what really goes on in the corridors of power			1
but the most explosive part of the fly - on - the - wall film about the inner workings of @entity12 was yesterday dramatically edited out amid claims it showed a @entity16 minister shout an obscenity at @entity18			1
@entity1 threatened legal action and issued a furious denial just hours before the final episode of @entity22 was to air on @entity23 last night			1
a comment that sounded like ' sanctimonious c * * * ' was shouted at the @entity26 during a @entity22 debate last june			1
it appeared to come from the direction of the defence minister but she said this suggestion was ' outrageous '			1
the heckling was recorded by programme maker @entity34 during filming in the chamber shortly after the queen set out the government 's agenda			1
in a preview tape seen by journalists , mr @entity34 said : ' official television coverage , even though it is heavily restricted , has fuelled public antagonism to mps			1
' but our cameras have witnessed the unsanitised version in which mps sometimes use the most offensive language			1
' miss @entity1 could then be clearly seen and heard on the back row of the @entity16 benches heckling mr @entity18			1
a publicist working for the production company behind the film emailed journalists on monday claiming miss @entity1 had sworn			1
miss @entity1 , 58 , was alerted and denied that she had used the word			1
the @entity23 then removed the sound of the heckling from the programme and the reference to the ' most offensive language '			1
instead in his narration , mr @entity34 referred to ' behaviour even rougher than is usually seen			1
' when told about the allegation by the @entity3 , miss @entity1 said she planned to contact her solicitor and the @entity66			1
footage : presenter @entity34 's voiceover to this footage of a @entity22 debate was changed , cutting out a reference to ' most offensive language '			1
instead he cited ' behaviour even rougher than is usually seen ' she insisted : ' i can absolutely assure you i have never used language like that			2
i would never use language like that and most certainly not in the @entity79 , nor against any opponent			2
' there is no way , i am telling you now , with the volume of my voice , that i would , even if i was minded to , which i am not			2
that word is never used in the @entity79			2
' miss @entity1 , who has been reprimanded by speaker @entity88 for behaviour in the @entity22 , said the debating chamber was noisy , but foul language was never used			1
when offered the opportunity by the @entity3 to view the footage , miss @entity1 said she had ' more important things ' to do			1
the @entity23 refused to comment on whether it had come under any pressure from @entity96 , her solicitor , the @entity98 or the @entity99			1
denial : @entity34 denied any knowledge of the scene and said the @entity23 had editorial control mr @entity34 yesterday declined to talk about the scene when contacted by the @entity3 and even claimed to have no knowledge of its existence			1
he said : ' i do n't know what you 're talking about			2
i do n't recognise what you 're talking about			2
anything you 're talking about is not in the programme			2
' the @entity23 has editorial control and they make the decisions on the way the programme is cut			1
' miss @entity1 , who once described herself as ' not a girl but a tough old bird ' , worked as a tv journalist before becoming a barrister			1
she was elected as @entity16 mp for @entity123 , @entity124 , at the last election in 2010			2
in 2013 , she apologised to @entity127 leader @entity126 after making lewd remarks about him			2
there is no list of banned swear words in the @entity22 , but terms deemed to be unparliamentary language according to the rule book include : pharisee , swine , jackass , hooligan , blackguard , cad , ruffian and insulting dog			2
in november communities minister @entity142 apologised for using a @entity22 speech on animal welfare to say obscene words after a dare at a dinner with @entity148 friends			1
a @entity23 spokesman said : ' changes can and are often made to the final version broadcast , as is the case with this episode			1
' @entity1 : ' it is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me ' i beg your pardon			1
i can be heard saying what ? no. absolutely not			2
and if you print that i will sue you because i would never			2
the c - word ? no absolutely not , i would never use that word and i would never use it in the @entity79 and i would certainly never use it â€¦ i 'm not having that			1
i can absolutely assure you i have never used language like that and i can equally assure you on the back row nobody , we would n't think of shouting a word like that , the foulest word			1
i 'm now going to ring both the press office here and at @entity174 , and i 'm going to ring my solicitor			2
i would never say that and that 's an extremely , extremely serious allegation			2
that word is never used in the @entity79			2
forgive me because i need to make a number of phone calls , because i 'm not having that			0
i would never use language like that and most certainly not in the @entity79 , nor against any opponent			0
i do n't use that word so you better not print it			0
there is no way , i am telling you now , with the volume of my voice that i would , even if i was minded to , which i am not			0
you guys should know this			0
you could n't shout out language like that			0
no , i 'm sorry			0
i would never use that word			0
i know that i do not use that word and if you print that i will bloody sue you because i would never use that word			0
i 'm going to go to the speaker			0
if there 's one person , well more than one , that the speaker would be listening to , it 's the likes of me			0
you heard me use the word c * * * in the @entity79 ? no sir			1
because i do not use it in my ordinary life and i would never use it in the @entity79 and i am profoundly offended at the suggestion i ever would			0
i just do n't use that word and anyone will tell you that because i 'm an old feminist who hates that word			0
if there 's word i loathe			0
and the idea i would call anybody in the @entity79 , i do n't use the word anyway , it 's just inconceivable , i do n't do that			0
i am sorry i absolutely do n't			0
you can hear how strongly i feel			0
you 're telling me you 've heard me use the c - word			1
you really are certain ? i do not use the @entity228			0
you know how that place operates , you do n't sit and shout out foul language			0
i think it is very important that you run this past your lawyers because you will not defame me , sir			0
i would never dream shouting out the c - word of all words			1
the one thing you never do is shout out foul language			0
you do n't behave like that			0
we 're noisy and i do n't say we 're not , but we do n't use foul language			0
i put my hands up when i do something wrong , but i 'm not having this			0
i would never do that			0
i 'm not having it			0
this is a very serious allegation			0
i can assure you i do not use the c - word and i certainly do not swear in the @entity79			1
i know some people do n't like our antics , but we do not			0
you better not defame me , i will have you , and i mean that			0
do forgive me , goodbye .			0
