' i 'm not backing down '			0
' i do n't see why i would offer an apology when i 'm actually speaking about the @entity8 communist regime and not the @entity8 people , ' she told @entity51			1
' i 'm very grateful to the @entity8 people and having them as trading partners , and i certainly know my @entity53 is '			1
after coming under increasing fire for his bizarre rant last monday night , @entity11 has delivered a letter to the @entity8 ambassador ' his excellency mr @entity57 '			1
in it he says : ' i most sincerely apologise for any insult to the @entity8 people caused by any of the language i used during my appearance on the @entity51 television program @entity63			1
' he went on to say that ' we always must have an open mind ' and that ' i now come to the realisation that what i said on @entity63 was an insult to @entity8 people everywhere and i wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincerely apology , that i am sorry that i said the things i said on the program			1
' @entity11 had said about the @entity8 that ' they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country ' , now he says sorry and that ' it is in the interest of the whole world that @entity9 and @entity8 have good relations '			1
@entity11 in the middle of that rant on @entity94 against the @entity8			2
today he 's done a complete backflip , apologising in a letter to the @entity8 ambassador , conceding he had insulted " @entity8 people everywhere ' friends again			1
this is a picture from back in 2009 where @entity11 and @entity100 of @entity8 celebrated the @entity8 first mining venture			0
he also added that ' it is in the interest of the whole world that @entity9 and @entity8 have good relations '			1
mr @entity11 had been roundly criticised for the rant and his comments labelled ' racist '			0
several community leaders and @entity106 said the tirade could hurt @entity9 's trade relationship with @entity8			1
the @entity4 leader tried to appease those critics by suggesting his comments were directed against @entity111 , with whom he 's locked in a series of legal disputes , even going as far as tweeting his position			1
on @entity3 's comment , foreign minister @entity116 said she hoped the senator would follow mr @entity11 's belated apology			2
' i hope that senator @entity3 likewise reflects on the comments that she 's made and the potential for harm with one of our largest trading partners , ' she told @entity51			0
agriculture minister @entity128 is travelling to @entity8 next week and expects to be quizzed about the ' unhelpful ' comments			0
mr @entity128 hoped @entity9 's trade talks with @entity8 would not be affected			2
@entity11 tried to fend off claims he was racist after the rant last monday by saying on @entity133 that the comments were aimed at a @entity8 company only @entity111 has accused mr @entity11 of using $ 12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013			0
the verbal spray included him calling @entity8 people ' bastards ' and ' mongrels ' who ' shoot their own people '			2
' the @entity8 government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free			0
so far they 've shifted $ 200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it			0
i do n't mind standing up against the @entity8 bastards and stop them from doing it , ' he said			0
he then claimed he was owed ' about $ 500 million by the communist @entity8 government			0
' ' we 'll be suing them and they 'll be answering the questions			0
we 've had ... an arbitration against these @entity8 mongrels - i 'm saying that because they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country			2
and we 're not going to let them , ' he said			0
in an attempt to smooth things over , foreign minister @entity116 told the @entity8 embassy that ' these were the comments of one member of @entity24 and not representative '			0
the @entity175 also chimed in by calling them ' over the top , shrill and wrong '			0
mr @entity11 will hope his letter of apology will bring to an end a forgettable fortnight for his party with his problems exacerbated by star @entity183 recruit @entity30 being forced to fend off plagiarism claims and @entity3 's suggestions @entity9 needed to significantly boost its military presence or risk ' letting our grandchildren become slaves ' .			1
