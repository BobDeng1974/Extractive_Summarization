by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:00 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 14:45 est , 27 december 2012 the @entity3 security bosses who resigned from their post after a damning investigation blamed the agency for ' systematic failures ' leading up to the terror attack on the @entity10 consulate in @entity11 , have reportedly not stepped down at all , drawing the ire of a @entity14 lawmaker			1
@entity15 , the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , and @entity17 , the deputy assistant secretary for embassy security , both quit after the independent probe last week			1
but an explosive new report on wednesday claims that not only have @entity15 has stayed put in the @entity3 , and has remained on the payroll			1
as the paper puts it , the ' resigning ' officials are merely changing desks			0
the revelations drew fire from @entity14 congresswoman @entity33 , a @entity34 , who called the @entity3 's actions ' pathetic			1
' @entity33 told @entity48 : ' if these reports are correct , they 're pathetic examples of yet another ruse about the tragedy of @entity29			2
' @entity3 officials proclaimed to the world that heads would roll after the deception related to the deceitful video excuse and the non existent spontaneous protest outside the consulate			1
' now we see that the discipline is a lie and all that has happened is the shuffling of the deck chairs			0
that will in no way change what the @entity68 found to be systemic failures of management and leadership in the @entity3			1
' attack : a @entity10 ambassador and three other @entity10 were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 ' systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the @entity3 resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for @entity29 and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place , ' the panel said as they released their findings last week			1
the report singled out the @entity88 and the @entity89 for criticism , saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in @entity29 , a city in @entity11 that was relatively lawless after the revolution that toppled @entity99 strongman @entity98			1
despite those failures , the @entity100 determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties and recommended no disciplinary action now			0
but it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future			0
the report appeared to break little new ground about the timeline of the @entity29 attack during which @entity99 ambassador @entity115 , information specialist @entity116 and former @entity117 and @entity118 - who were contractors working for the @entity120 - were killed			1
burning issue : ambassador @entity115 and three other @entity10 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the consulate in @entity29 @entity115 ' slaying was the first of a @entity10 ambassador since 1988			1
but it confirmed that contrary to initial accounts , there was no protest outside the consulate and said responsibility for the incident rested entirely with the terrorists who attacked the mission			0
in the immediate aftermath of the attack , administration officials linked the attack to the spreading protests over an @entity10 - made , @entity144 film that had begun in @entity145 earlier that day			1
those comments came after evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack			0
@entity150 ambassador @entity149 appeared on numerous tv talk shows the sunday after the attack and used the administration talking points linking it to the film			2
derailed : @entity149 appeared on numerous talk shows after the attack and used talking points linking it to the anti-islam film an ensuing brouhaha in the heat of the presidential campaign eventually cost her the job to replace @entity165 as secretary of state in president @entity168 's second term			2
the review board determined that there had been no immediate , specific tactical warning of a potential attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11			0
however , the report said there had been several worrisome incidents in the run - up to the attack that should have set off warning bells			2
while criticizing @entity3 management in @entity182 along with the local militia force and contract guards that the mission depended on for protection , the report said @entity10 personnel on the ground in @entity29 ' performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near - impossible situation			1
' it said the response by @entity88 agents on the scene and @entity120 operatives at a nearby compound that later came under attack itself had been ' timely and appropriate ' but absolved the military from any blame			0
' there was simply not enough time for armed @entity10 military assets to have made a difference			2
' the @entity3 sent a classified version of the report to lawmakers on tuesday and shortly thereafter released an unclassified version			2
the report made 29 recommendations to improve embassy security , particularly at high threat posts			2
in an accompanying letter to @entity218 , @entity216 thanked the board for its ' clear - eyed , serious look at serious systemic challenges ' and said she accepted all the recommendations			0
killed : ambassador @entity115 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity116 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity117 ( left ) and @entity118 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack some of those challenges were revealed in earlier congressional hearings when several @entity3 officials discussed competing demands for security and cost prohibitions			1
@entity216 said the department had already begun to implement some of the recommendations			0
they include increasing by several hundred the number of @entity240 guards stationed at diplomatic missions throughout the world , relying less on local security forces for protection at embassies , consulates and other offices , and increasing hiring and deployment of highly trained @entity88 agents at at - risk posts			0
members of local @entity99 militias provided some security around the consulate , but in the attack it became unclear whose side they were on			0
the report also called on @entity218 to fully fund the @entity3 's security initiative , noting that budget constraints in the past had led some management officials to emphasize savings over security despite numerous requests from the @entity29 mission and embassy in @entity268 for enhanced protection			1
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours ' for many years the @entity3 has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work with varying degrees of success , ' it said			1
this has led to efficiencies but also ' had the effect of conditioning a few @entity3 managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation			0
' it said the number of @entity88 staff in @entity29 before and on the day of the attack ' was inadequate despite repeated requests ... for additional staffing			1
' on her way out : in a letter to lawmakers , @entity216 urged @entity218 to support the @entity3 's security requests ' the solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from @entity218 to support @entity3 needs , which , in total , constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security , ' it said			2
' @entity218 must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary resources			0
' @entity218 has denied some funding requests from the @entity3 for more security			0
in her letter to lawmakers , @entity216 urged @entity218 to support the department 's security requests , noting that ' all of us ... have a responsibility to provide the men and women serving this country with the best possible security and support			0
' the @entity29 attack has highlighted the larger question of how @entity10 diplomats and intelligence officers can do their jobs in unstable environments , as @entity335 spreads across @entity336 , without also expanding their security			1
diplomats have said that overreacting to the attack could produce what some are calling a ' @entity29 effect ' that would wall them off from the people they are supposed to be engaging			2
in her letter to lawmakers , @entity216 said , ' we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security ' but she stressed that ' our diplomats can not work in bunkers			0
' ' we must accept a level of risk to protect this country we love and to advance our interests and values around the world , ' she said .			0
