by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:20 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:20 est , 29 december 2013 a call by the @entity4 for a total ban on smacking children has angered family campaigners			1
@entity8 said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to ‘ physical abuse ’ , and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters			1
she sparked controversy by calling for a total ban which would see parents facing criminal action for corporal punishment			1
@entity8 said smacking children should be made illegal because it was akin to ' physical abuse ' , and the current law gave pets and adults more rights to protection from violence than youngsters however , family campaigners claimed there were times when parents needed to smack young children because they were blatantly ignoring other punishments or warnings			1
under current laws , it is illegal for a parent to smack a child if it leaves a bruise , but a lighter smack or ‘ reasonable chastisement ’ are allowed			2
dr @entity43 said : ‘ personally , having been a teacher , and never having had an issue where i ’d need to use physical punishment , i believe we should move to ban it			0
‘ in law you are forbidden from striking another adult , and from physically chastising your pets , but somehow there is a loophole around the fact that you can physically chastise your child			1
’ dr @entity43 , who has two adult step - children , said that despite her strong feelings about the issue , her office was not planning to fight for a ban next year			2
however , family campaigners claimed there were times when parents needed to smack young children because they were blatantly ignoring other punishments or warnings @entity69 , of the @entity70 , said : ‘ it ’s right that we continue to push to get children equal protection in law			1
' it would not be intended to criminalise good parents but to put into law what more and more parents are already moving towards – finding better ways than smacking to discipline their children			2
’ but @entity81 , of family group parents outloud , branded dr @entity43 ’s comments as ‘ extremely irresponsible ’			0
she said : ‘ of course nobody should thrash or beat or abuse a child but there are times when you have to show a child that the parameters have been passed			0
‘ children have to realise there ’s a limit beyond which you can go			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ our policy on smacking is clear			0
we do not condone violence towards children			0
however , we do not wish to criminalise parents for issuing a mild smack			0

@entity8 say pets and adult continue to receive better protection
@entity4 says parents should face criminal action
they are currently allowed to strike a child if it does not leave a mark
