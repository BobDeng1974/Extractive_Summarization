the 27 - year - old graphic designer who hid under a sink and texted vital information to police as the terrorist @entity5 brothers were holed up inside a printing works has spoken for the first time			1
emotional and at times wiping away tears as he was shown footage of his boss telling how he pushed him into hiding , @entity15 , told @entity17 2 tv : ' i want to say thank you			1
' he gave me the seconds i needed to hide			2
it is thanks to him that i am here			2
owner @entity53 saw them just before they burst through the door and told @entity15 to run and hide so that one of them might live			2
@entity15 fled to the canteen kitchen			2
he said : ' i hid under a sink in a cabinet with two hinged doors 70cm by 90cm and 40cm deep			1
' most of the time they were in the boss 's office next door			2
i heard shooting and then one of them opened the cupboard next to mine			2
' then he opened the fridge he was only 50cm away			2
i thought he was going to open every cupboard			2
the printworks owner was sitting in his first - floor office at 9am when he heard a ring on the doorbell ' he took a drink from the sink and i could see his shadow			1
my back was against the pipe and i could feel the water flowing			0
' it was like you see in the movies			1
at that point the brain stops thinking , the heart stops beating , you stop breathing			1
' but the young designer knew that he had to somehow communicate what was happening to the outside world			0
carefully he texted his father first : ' i am hidden on the first floor			0
i think they have killed everyone			0
tell the police to intervene			1
' for eight hours the terrified @entity15 guided police in a series of text messages describing everything he could hear and where the terrorists were moving			1
carnage : the building 's blown - out windows			1
mr @entity15 texted his father : ' i am hidden on the first floor ' the scene at the factory in @entity112 , which was stormed by the two gunmen during the siege @entity116 prosecutor @entity115 said he sent vital tactical information as he crouched under the sink			1
at that stage he did not know that his boss had calmed the brothers , made them coffee and even dressed a wound one of them had sustained , before they let him go			1
as the @entity125 faced police in a final bloody stand off , @entity15 stayed hidden until police came and found him			1
' i could n't use my mobile at first , ' he said			0
' i was in the foetal position and could n't get to it easily			0
' then i took the risk			0
my first instinct was to turn it to silent , then vibrate but i had to make sure it was n't touching the cabinet			0
' the vibrations would have been heard			0
' when i got messages to my family one of them was beside the police so i was immediately reassured to know i was in touch with the outside world			1
@entity144 : the brothers get ready to escape after their killing spree at @entity52 last wednesday solidarity : mr @entity15 did not feel ready to joined the mass marches in @entity116 , but his spirit was with them ' i knew then i could give them information with my knowledge of the plant			1
' and i knew that a team would come for me			0
' visibly moved by remembering the hours he waited for the start of the assault , always in fear of being discovered , he described the moment he heard the operation begin			0
' i curled up well , protecting my head			0
i 'd been warned they would come for me and that i was n't to move			0
' but when i realised the police were about to enter , i disobeyed			1
i was too scared that the brothers had booby trapped the building and bombs were placed in the corridor by me			1
' i fled to the end of the room			0
the explosions and gunfire ceased and he said : ' then i heard voices , then the door opened and i saw the light			0
they guided me to a window and brought me out where a doctor was waiting			0
' he said he would have loved to join yesterday 's march in the capital but had n't the strength			0
' but my heart was with the people			1
i am in solidarity with the famililies in @entity190 and @entity191 who did n't have our luck			0
