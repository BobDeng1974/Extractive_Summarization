by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:01 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 02:58 est , 3 june 2013 billionaire : strolling through central @entity4 last month , @entity3 appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme billionaire @entity3 , wearing his late wife @entity6 's engagement and wedding rings around his neck on a cord , has made a rare public appearance a year after she was found dead in their £ 50million @entity4 mansion			1
last year a judge cited him as a tragic warning of the ‘ utterly destructive ’ effects of drug abuse , after he admitted hiding his crack addict wife ’s body for two months while he carried out a desperate charade to convince their servants she was alive			2
@entity3 , 49 , cut a pathetic figure as he stood in the dock but strolling through central @entity4 , the @entity26 heir appeared to be responding well to his drug treatment programme which was imposed by the court			2
sporting a new bushy beard , he wore a black leather jacket , striped polo shirt and @entity32 style hat as he walked with the aid of a walking stick close to the private clinic where he is being helped to end his addiction			1
it appeared an improvement from the last pictures of him in public with his wife , when he looked gaunt and confused as he stumbled through @entity4 close to the couple ’s £ 70million mansion			1
days after those images were taken in may 2012 , @entity3 ’s wife @entity6 died at the 50 - room property in @entity49 , @entity50			1
but rather than inform police , @entity3 banned staff from entering the couple ’s squalid ‘ crack den ’ bedroom in their otherwise - immaculate home			1
he said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day			0
in fact he was covering her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes , blankets and plastic sealed with industrial tape before covering it in deodorant to mask the smell			0
@entity3 hid her body for more than two months before he was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in @entity75 , south @entity4			2
close up : @entity3 looks to have his late wife 's wedding and engagement rings around his neck on a cord then : the photograph appears to show @entity3 is responding well to his treatment programme and contrasts with his gaunt appearance in early may 2012 , days before the death of his 48 - year - old @entity86 wife police who searched his car found a crack pipe , cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his @entity94 and noticed his pupils were dilated			1
when they later raided his house , 48 - year - old mrs @entity96 was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker			0
@entity3 received a ten month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a drug rehabilitation programme at a private clinic after he admitted the common law offence of failing to prevent his wife ’s lawful and decent burial			1
@entity109 was told that the couple had struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘ loving ’ family			0
younger years : @entity109 was told that @entity6 and @entity3 had struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ' loving ' family but their fateful decision to raise a glass of champagne together to toast the new millennium on december 31 1999 sent them spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything			1
judge @entity131 told @entity3 as he sentenced him : ‘ if ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families , it is to be found in the facts of this case			0
‘ you and your wife had every material advantage imaginable , and for a time a happy family life			0
your relapse into the misuse of drugs , together with that of your wife , destroyed all that			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s wealth comes from the world ’s largest food packaging firm , @entity26 , which was founded in @entity150 by his grandfather			2
like several other members of the family , mr @entity3 settled in @entity4 .			0
