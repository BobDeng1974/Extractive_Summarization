by @entity1 reporter published : 00:08 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 28 may 2013 a group of purported @entity4 engineers has lifted the veil on the company to reveal what makes it one of the most famously secretive enterprises in the @entity9			2
employees are told not to even speak to their wives about the projects they are working on			1
black cloth shrouds cover new products when designers are n't working on them			1
corporate security teams are looking over each engineer 's shoulder at every turn , and a unique system called - what else - ' @entity21 ' is used to monitor every prototype device			1
secrets : the late @entity4 ceo @entity26 is credited with setting the tone for his company 's culture of intense secrecy several former employees and their family members chimed in that ' fear ' is what keeps leaks from coming out - fear of immediate termination and massive lawsuits			1
current employees , though , reported that it was love of the products that kept employees from blabbing about the newest gadgets that @entity4 is releasing			1
many said they believe @entity4 fans genuinely want to be surprised by new products			2
the revelations come from the question - and - answer website @entity47 , which received two dozen responses when a user asked : ' how does @entity4 keep secrets so well			2
' the forum began last summer when rumors were beginning to swirl about the not - yet - released @entity53			0
numerous users who claimed to be current or former @entity4 employees chimed in			2
family members of @entity4 employees also added anecdotes about life at the company			0
perhaps the most jaw - dropping response came @entity62 , the wife of former @entity4 engineer @entity63			1
@entity62 told a story of how she happened to be in her husband 's the office in 2001 when he revealed to his boss that he had developed a way for @entity4 's @entity70 operating system to run on pcs with @entity73 processors			1
new images : videos emerged days before the @entity53 release last year of a prototype of the new phone			0
it is thought that product was leaked from a @entity82 factory at the time not even mr @entity63 's supervisor knew what he was doing			0
when he installed his version of the @entity4 operating system onto a @entity87 , his boss turned to mr @entity63 and told him that his wife was to , ' forget everything i know , and he will not be allowed to speak to me about it again until it is publicly announced			1
' i guess he had some kind of " @entity96 " memory wipe in mind , ' ms @entity62 writes			0
@entity4 's jump to pc compatibility and using @entity73 chips in @entity102 computers was one of the biggest announcements in its history when it went public in 2005			0
another former engineer , @entity106 - who now works for @entity108 - told a similar story when he was tapped to make @entity109 run on @entity110 ' i could n't tell my wife anything ; she knew i was working in a different building across the street and pulling very late nights , but she did n't know what i was doing , ' he writes			1
new @entity4 ceo @entity117 has only strengthened the anti-leak policies put in place by his predecessor ' when i had to travel to @entity123 @entity122 ... she asked to come along			0
i had to say " no way " ... my parents heard i was travelling to @entity126 , but did n't hear anything else ; they suspected i was involved with something related to the @entity129 ... ' his own co-workers did n't know what he was working on			0
' we were asked to just sort of disappear - the phrase i often use to describe it was " make people think you 've picked up a drug habit and are n't coming in regularly			0
" i was n't even allowed to tell my manager ; all he knew is that i 'd been borrowed for a secret project , ' he writes			0
a poster who claimed to be a current @entity4 employee described tight security at @entity4 headquarters in @entity146 , @entity147			0
' all prototypes are laser marked with serial numbers and tracked by a central tracking system ( called @entity21 )			2
physical security is also highly prioritized , with prototypes required to be locked up when not in use , ' the engineer writes			0
locked down : often times co-workers do n't even know what other members of their group are working on , employees say @entity161 , a former @entity4 account executive , write that employees work under threat of being fired if they leak something			2
' the secrecy is upheld throughout the organization knowing that there is a corporate security team pretty much looking over your shoulder at all times and where even minor violations are grounds for immediate termination , ' he wrote			1
labs where new products are developed are guarded by cameras , locked doors with key - card access available only to the few developers working on the project , and secretaries trained to monitor anyone who enters or leaves the area , said one poster who claimed a family member used to work for @entity4			1
@entity4 take security , even in their very secure areas , just one step farther with a dramatic flourish : ' in labs , every project is kept under black cloths , just in case someone gets into a section they were n't supposed to be in , ' the @entity47 poster writes			1
' plus the labs are all sectioned off and you have to sign into your part of the lab. '			0
