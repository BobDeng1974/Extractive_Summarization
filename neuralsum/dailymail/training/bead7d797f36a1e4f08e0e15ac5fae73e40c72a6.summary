@entity0 intends to play @entity1 as much as possible and in a more attacking role in midfield when the @entity5 captain joins the @entity6 this summer			1
@entity1 ended speculation over where his future lay on wednesday when he announced he will join the @entity10 champions from july			1
@entity12 's mock - up of how @entity1 could look in the colours of @entity6 @entity1 discusses his future move in a video interview with @entity6 the @entity5 captain insists he has not moved to the @entity10 for a ' holiday ' but to continue winning medals @entity18 ( 5 ) : 2002 , 2005 , 2011 , 2012 , 2014 @entity10 @entity19 ( 4 ) : 1998 , 2002 , 2010 , 2011 @entity21 ( @entity20 ) ( 9 ) : 1996 , 1999 , 2001 , 2002 , 2005 , 2009 , 2011 , 2012 , 2014 winners ( regular season ) ( 8 ) : 1996 , 1998 , 1999 , 2001 , 2002 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 what @entity1 could look like for @entity6 in @entity10 in our mocked - up picture the former @entity29 skipper 's decision to end his long association with the @entity32 club was , in part , due to being told his playing time would be managed by @entity36 boss @entity35			1
it appears that will not be a problem at the @entity6 , whose head coach @entity42 has already started calling @entity1 ' @entity43 ' and is keen to get him playing further up the pitch			1
' i will manage his minutes , i 'm going to try and get him on the field as much as possible , ' said @entity42 in a conference call			0
' my best guess is that we will play him closer to a forward than towards our centre - backs			2
he 's a player with obviously very good attacking qualities and we want to get him pushed as close to goal as we can , when we can			0
' i think we can accommodate that through a variety of positions			0
it 'll take a little bit of time but we 'll get it figured out by the time @entity43 arrives			2
' @entity42 revealed the @entity6 have been tracking @entity1 for some time			1
but he admitted to thinking , until recently , the possibility of bringing him to the west coast club was remote			0
' on and off over the years , @entity43 has always been a name that we 've examined as a potential player to come to the @entity6 , ' said @entity0			1
' i would say my thinking was that it was going to be a long shot to acquire @entity43 , but as we got closer towards the end of the year the interest on both parties picked up and we were very fortunate to be able to secure a deal			0
' the @entity36 icon admitted that he was a ' scouser through and through ' and would have to adapt to new lifestyle @entity1 has guaranteed @entity6 supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment @entity1 assured @entity5 fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club arena is confident @entity1 will have few problems adapting at the @entity86			1
' he 's @entity88 speaking which makes the transition a little bit easier , he 's been to the @entity91 a number of times , knows players on our team so i think when he steps in he 'll be able to contribute right away , ' said @entity0			2
' he understands the challenge that lies ahead , he knows this is n't going to be an easy process , he has no desire to come to a league where he 's in retirement			0
' he wants to continue to excel , he 's such a great professional that i think that we 're going to see he 's going to come in and make our team better right from the start			0
' @entity1 is expected to link up with former @entity5 team - mate @entity106 at the @entity6 , with @entity42 confirming he expects the @entity107 to remain with the club despite speculation linking him with a move			1
' they 're two outstanding players , they 've played together before , they know each other , ' added @entity42			0
' i think in a short period they 're going to be able to have a great understanding of each other , and i 'm quite confident that we 'll see that they 'll be able to create chances for the @entity6			2
