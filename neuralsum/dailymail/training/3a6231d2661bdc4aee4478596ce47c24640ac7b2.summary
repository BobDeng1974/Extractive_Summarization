by @entity1 reporter published : 03:53 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 01:36 est , 3 april 2013 if you know someone who ’s recently undergone a transformation – lost weight , toned up , suddenly seem incredibly smiley all the time – perhaps they ’ve become a client of @entity9			1
it has become such a phenomenon that @entity12 in - the - know refer to that ' @entity9 glow '			1
for @entity9 has become the gym in @entity15			1
founded by @entity16 seven years ago , it recently moved to new premises at the @entity18 in @entity19 , and is patronised by the likes of @entity21 , @entity22 and countless other supermodels and @entity25 a-listers			1
the rumour mill is abuzz that an @entity28 outpost will open later in 2013			2
@entity16 ’s accompanying @entity29 and @entity31 diet and exercise books ( @entity33 , @entity34 ) have become bestsellers , and the gym ’s @entity36 shakes - which stars like @entity21 regularly tweet about - went global in january			1
fitness guru : @entity16 set up @entity9 seven years ago and has fast become the go - to guy in the capital thanks to his innovative approach @entity9 is far more than just a place to come to work out and tone up ; it ’s a mecca for anyone with body issue demons to exorcise			1
the level of post-session support is such that , if you ’re having trouble making the right food choices , you can even text @entity9 staff for guidance			2
the positive attitude is infectious and the overall effect is cathartic , as any devotee will tell you			0
' it 's not like you come in to do a healing session , but it is just a very healing place , ' says @entity16			2
' it ’s not so much what we do , it ’s why we do it – and the reason we do it is to change people ’s lives			0
' a-list fans : @entity21 , left , and @entity70 have worked out at the @entity19 gym bestseller : @entity16 also imparts health and fitness advice in his book ' @entity29 and @entity76 ' at @entity9 , the crack team of trainers rotates , so that your sessions are always interesting and challenging , you reap the benefit of different experts ’ specialities , and you wo n’t be knocked off your fitness course if one of them is away			1
your attitude to your own health and fitness is key to your level of success , says @entity16			1
' it 's not about ' what 's more important , food or exercise ? ' it 's the attitude			0
you ca n't really have one without the other , ' he explains			0
in short : it 's a holistic approach			0
' i want to change your mind - set as well as your shape , ' continues @entity16			2
' i believe that if we start changing the conversations people have with themselves , then we can really take the shame and guilt away from people ’s relationship with food			0
' so your trainer might talk to you about your emotional food triggers , for example			0
' but it ’s not like in the middle of a session we say ‘ ok , we ’re going to talk about the mentality now			0
that ’s part and parcel of the session			0
' if you feel like some super intensive treatment , you could always move in to the hotel , have your daily training session in the gym and the indoor pool , and eat only the @entity29 and @entity31 menu – even couples are doing it together			2
get that @entity9 glow : the gym is based at the @entity18 in @entity15 's @entity19 ' i truly believe that @entity9 was born when we moved to the @entity18 , ' says @entity16			1
' because it gave us the facilities we need , this amazing , beautiful space and infrastructure to take us to the next level			0
' and how @entity16 feels about the @entity138 is pretty much how clients feel about @entity9			1
a next level never seemed so easy – and pleasurable – to achieve			0
