@entity3 boss @entity27 started with @entity4 up front at @entity24 and the 26 - year - old continued his rich vein of form with his 12th goal of the season in just 20 games			1
@entity4 impressed @entity6 last season also and has now scored 23 goals in 38 games since joining from @entity37			1
@entity1 has also been watched by @entity38 while @entity39 failed with a £ 10million offer for the @entity42 striker in the summer			1
@entity4 ( right ) was on target at @entity24 on satruday - despite their 3 - 1 @entity45 defeat @entity3 may well have been wiser to take that offer in light of their transfer embargo imposed by the @entity49 on monday			1
they will now be under restrictions to what , if any player , they can bring in			0
there is also interest mounting in @entity3 ' 23 - year - old winger @entity55 , with several @entity11 and @entity45 clubs represented at recent games			1
@entity0 have considered moves for the likes of @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 but @entity62 will be staying in the @entity64 and @entity63 is expensive			2

they are evaluating the squad and are prepared to make changes in january			0
@entity96 are also among clubs keen on midfielder @entity98			0
there is interest in the 29 - year - old @entity102 star from @entity103 and @entity104 also but @entity105 hopes to persuade him to make a quick return to the @entity11 with @entity96			0
@entity74 's team - mate @entity98 ( left ) is attracting interest from @entity11 side @entity96 @entity109 want @entity111 midfielder @entity110			1
the 27 - year - old is in and out of @entity114 ' side at the moment and the @entity117 club sense he could be open to a return home			0
