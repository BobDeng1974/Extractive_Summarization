speaking in february of this year , @entity44 president @entity56 called for retrospective action to be taken against divers			1
‘ @entity60 evidence can be used for serious breaches of the principle of fair play such as brawling , spitting at opponents , verbal insults and racist slurs , or for incorrectly awarded red or yellow cards , ’ he said			1
' in cases such as these we must make use of the avenues already open to us and intervene after the event if necessary			0
