from mysterious markings in the @entity7 desert , crop circles , religious messages and even corporate logos etched into fields and rocks in @entity13 , strange sites that only reveal themselves from a birds - eye - view are scattered across the world			1
natural phenomena including a heart - shaped lake in @entity21 and the ‘ @entity22 ’ – a strange rippling in the land that looks like a face – in @entity26 , are clearly visible from the air			1
is this @entity29 's secret headquarters ? a building in @entity32 , @entity30 seems to show the super hero 's symbol on its roof a collection of the ‘ strangest ’ sites found on the massive interactive map include man - made wonders such as giant animal carvings in rock and a psychedelic guitar - shaped forest planted in @entity44			1
a farmer called @entity46 planted 7,000 cypress trees to create the shape in the fertile agricultural region of @entity44 's ' @entity50 ' in memory of his wife			0
markings of concentric circles on fields and strange geometric patterns in the desert might have alien believers and conspiracy theorist scratching their heads and looking for information about how the artworks were created			1
it appears as if people are trying to take advantage of @entity4 as a way of spreading messages , as one site shows that people have carved ‘ @entity70 loves you ’ into the landscape of @entity73 , while a @entity75 flag is painted onto a hill in @entity77 to make a political point			2
the ' @entity22 ' in @entity79 , @entity26 , @entity26 looks a little like a face if viewed from above			0
a website called @entity82 has collected what it claims are the strangest sites seen on @entity4 a message from above : people in @entity87 , @entity73 have used @entity4 to spread the word someone in @entity13 must really love @entity90			1
the logo seems to be sculpted in sandy soil in @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity13 corporate logos for @entity96 and @entity90 have also been spied from high above the clouds			1
the sites were curated by website @entity82 , which also collected views of less mysterious locations , such as giant airplane parking lots , a swastika - shaped building in @entity104 and huge herds of animals on the run in @entity108			1
in the past week it has been revealed that a distinctive circular pattern made from sand in the @entity113 desert is an environmental art installation			0
town planners seem to have made a feature of this heart - shaped lake in @entity119 , @entity21 presumably not the work of aliens with a penchant for surfing the @entity124 , this @entity96 logo is etched into a corn filed in @entity126 , @entity127 is this a human or a cat ? this ' big friendly giant ' guards @entity131 , @entity132 in @entity13 it was spotted from above and some people thought it could be anything from a landing strip for alien spacecraft to an ancient monument to the gods			2
it appeared in 1997 and has been baffling tourists and users of @entity4 ever since			2
the design , which measures over one million square feet , was created by artists @entity144 , @entity146 and @entity147 to celebrate ' the desert as a state of mind , a landscape of the mind ’			0
this strange pattern can be found in a desert in @entity154 and might have alien believers and conspiracy theorists scratching their heads about what it might be and how it was created this guitar is located in the fertile agricultural region of @entity44 's ' @entity50 '			0
the guitar - shaped forest was planted by a farmer called @entity46 in memory of his wife and is made up of 7,000 cypress trees ‘ desert breath ’ features two interlocking spirals , one with vertical cones and the other with conical depressions in the desert floor			1
it was originally designed with a small lake at its centre , but recent images on @entity178 , show the lake has since emptied			0
a giant swirling design etched into the @entity113 desert could trick the eye into thinking an alien spacecraft has landed			0
but the mesmerising pattern is , in fact , the work of three artists making a political point : this giant @entity75 flag is painted so that it can viewed from the air in @entity191 , @entity77 if you look closely , you can see a giant target marker in this patch of arid scrub land in @entity7 , @entity196 is @entity197 lost ? this giant lion is carved into the countryside in @entity200 , @entity201			0
