by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 24 april 2013 @entity1 at home in @entity3 @entity6 @entity5 pottery designer @entity1 has revealed how in her darkest moments - following the horse - riding accident that left her mother severely brain - damaged aged 53 - she would go to the cinema alone and drink neat vodka to numb the pain			1
the mother - of - four , whose pretty polka - dot teapots and plates speckled with little pink hearts are stocked in middle class kitchens all over the country , says she used the fiction of film and theatre as an escape			1
speaking in a new book by ad - man @entity25 titled @entity26 : how a @entity28 of @entity27 , @entity29 - who founded her eponymous earthenware company based in @entity32 in 1985 , and in 2011 turned over £ 15m of profit - says : ' i 've built a switch - off mechanism , otherwise i 'm not sure i 'd have survived			1
' i can remember the horror of sleepless nights i 've had			2
sometimes , you have to sort of use an escape like fiction ; theatre is very good ; cinema is brilliant ; cinema and alcohol are very , very effective			2
' i can remember going to see @entity44 , at a very hard time , sitting in the front row having had two large vodkas , feeling absolutely no pain at all			2
' @entity49 , 51 , who was one of eight siblings and now has @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 with designer husband @entity55 , continues : ' i think a tragedy like this fires you up			2
i do n't exactly understand why , but in some strange , probably quite simple way , what you 're doing in your career , you 're doing it for her			1
' it 's often unfocused and there can be anger , but there 's a real longing to put it right - even though you ca n't really			1
' @entity49 discusses the stress of having to put her mother into care while juggling two young children and a business , and how when she turned 40 she was on the verge of a breakdown			1
@entity1 began designing earthenware when she was looking for a birthday present for her mother but could n't find any designs she liked she says : ' whatever it was , i was exhausted			1
and i started finding the work pretty ghastly ... and lonely			2
but then you think that it 's very selfish on the other people who are struggling for me to be failing on not one , but two counts : the business is n't growing and i 'm personally finding it exhausting as well			1
' you feel there must be something very badly wrong with you personally			2
you 've got to be ready to admit that things have to give			2
it 's a little bit like making your house look impeccable for a magazine , which i 've always been very careful not to do			1
' you can make yourself extremely miserable trying to do everything perfectly			0
no one is perfect , but women get forced into thinking they have to be			0
' @entity1 at her pop - up shop in the @entity102 in @entity103 @entity49 developed rheumatoid arthritis which left her incapacitated , and was told she would only rid herself of it when she cut the stress out of her life , so @entity55 began helping wit0 the company 's administrative work			1
' i think he 'd seen how tough it had been for me , ' she says			0
' but it turned out that he could do it just as well as me ; better in fact			1
i 'd tripled the size of the business and then he more than doubled			0
' explaining how her childhood influence her business , @entity49 says : ' i think that the brand is very informal and i think that , luckily , i am as well			0
' i think it 's what my mum was			0
@entity127 's influence is very pervasive ; strangely , probably more in the business than in my family life			1
' i feel that i 'm trying to capture the spirit of what she made my home life like as a child ; what was unusual and special about it			0
and then turn that into a business			0
it ’s a strange thing to want to do really , is n't it ? ' @entity127 is still alive , so i ca n't mourn her because she 's alive , but i want to explain her			1
i sort of feel that when we get this business right - in any aspect of the business - it 's explaining her and what she stood for			1
and that feels very necessary - strangely			1
' an @entity1 personalised teapot , £ 50 , left , and an oven design she did for @entity152 , £ 9,999 @entity153 , £ 32 money ' although my parents and stepfather were always generous , i think i inherited a bit of angst about money from my grandparents : not having quite enough , living tight , feeling worried			1
however , once you start to make what once might have seemed a lot of money , it brings its own new set of hideous responsibilities			0
in @entity55 and @entity168 , you just could n't find a couple who have less desire to stay in fancy resorts or hotels or drive fast cars			1
for him , money means land to do something beautiful with ; to me , it 's about trying to make some lovely things happen here			0
and do funny things : like , i have a sister with learning difficulties and it 's her birthday next week , so i 'm hiring a pink stretch @entity184 to collect her and take her to the circus			0
i just like to do stupid things like that			0
it only cost a few hundred quid , but it 's what mum could n't have done because she was always careful with money			2
' @entity5 design ' in this country , we 're still not training enough engineers or investing enough in design and we 're being overlapped by the rest of the world			0
if i had my way , i 'd like all children to go round factories while still at primary school			0
we do bring quite a few in here , but not enough			0
' her new project ' we 've bought the site of @entity208 , but all that 's left is a shard and ruins			0
it 's a beautiful place in a lovely , funny , mad village , obsessed with @entity216 dancing			0
i 've increasingly realised , when you lift the carpet of @entity220 silliness , even in the soft @entity221 , that there 's still lots of real life going on in @entity5 , and this is an example ; another really strange and interesting connection we 've been able to make with a very rural community			0
' extracted from @entity26 : how a @entity28 of entrepreneurs made their names by @entity25 , founder of @entity231 ad agency @entity230 , and @entity232 ( @entity233 , £ 20 )			2
