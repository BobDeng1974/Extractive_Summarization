@entity0 will end his self - imposed @entity2 exile on tuesday night - after admitting that he elected to stay away from @entity4 games while the battle raged for control of the troubled club			1
@entity0 , who steered the @entity9 giants to nine league titles in a row , revealed that he got fed up of being accused of ‘ taking sides ’ in the @entity13 versus @entity15 fight for the future of the financially - stricken outfit			1
but days after @entity18 tycoon @entity13 prevailed in his bid to take control , @entity0 will be back cheering on @entity21 and his team against @entity23 on tuesday evening as they bid to reach the semi finals of the @entity26			1
@entity0 won nine league titles in a row when he was in charge at @entity2 @entity0 celebrates a @entity4 goal during his time in charge of the @entity9 outfit @entity0 handed the managerial reins to @entity21 in 2011 , but returned to the club as chairman in may 2013 only to quit less than three months later following a period of bitter in - fighting			1
explaining his non-attendance at matches since quitting as manager and then as chairman , the former @entity42 boss said : ‘ at first i did n’t go because i did n’t want people thinking i was - not interfering , exactly - but going to watch @entity44 ( @entity21 ) and the other boys i ’d left there			1
that was initially my main reason for not going back			2
‘ but when ( former chief executive ) @entity49 asked me to go on the board i went back and going to games was another aspect of ( the role )			2
‘ but since i left the board , the reason i do n’t go back is because is everybody keeps saying to me : ” you are supporting that side ; or you are supporting the other side			2
” i thought : “ i ’m better off not bothering going			2
” @entity21 ( near ) was @entity0 's assistant when he was in charge of @entity4 @entity0 celebrates @entity4 ' victory over @entity64 in the @entity66 final in 2011 ‘ so i have n’t been to an awful lot of matches since i left			1
i watch the tv coverage and i read a lot about the club but i do n’t go along to many games			2
but i do miss going to the games			0
i ’ll go on tuesday night to see how they do against @entity23			1
’ @entity0 was speaking as one of his @entity2 idols , @entity75 was inducted into the @entity78 alongside @entity80 legend @entity79 , and former @entity64 and @entity82 striker @entity81			1
capped 22 times for @entity42 , @entity75 - now aged 75 - played 227 games for @entity4 as a winger			1
he scored 98 goals for the @entity2 club before moving to @entity88 and @entity89 – on each occasion teaming up with @entity0 who had previously cheered him from the @entity2 terraces as a boy			1
‘ i went to @entity2 and watched @entity94 play in the late 1950s and early 1960s @entity4 team , ’ said @entity0			1
former @entity4 director @entity15 in the stands during the club 's match against @entity99 @entity13 has given @entity4 a £ 2 million bailout , and wants full control of the club ‘ he also worked beside my old man when he was a boy , strangely enough			1
‘ at that time , @entity4 had a fantastic team and it was an enjoyable period to go and watch them			1
‘ @entity107 was one of the main players and the number of goals he scored for a winger was fantastic			0
‘ nowadays we do n’t have wingers of that type			0
‘ @entity42 were lucky back then because we had @entity79 and @entity115 who were similar types			0
‘ they were direct and they threatened the goal as much as they created opportunities for other players			0
‘ so @entity107 was a guy i really enjoyed watching as a boy			0
‘ he also came to play at @entity88 along with @entity124 when i was a player at @entity125 and they were both fantastic professionals			0
‘ they could have tailed off at the end of their careers but they had a great attitude and it was great for a young player like myself to see that			0
‘ it was a big thrill for me			0
i ’d never have imagined i would have played alongside @entity75			0
he was terrific , so down to earth			0
‘ then , later , @entity107 was assistant manager at @entity89 when i went there for a year			2
we had a good young team at that time but unfortunately they all got sold			0
that stuff happened even back then			0
‘ then @entity107 became a manager and he transferred me back to @entity88 ! ‘ but it ’s great to see him inducted into the @entity78			2
his family was there with him and it was great to see them share in the honour with him			0
