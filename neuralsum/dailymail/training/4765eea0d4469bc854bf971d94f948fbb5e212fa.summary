by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 14 may 2013 the toll of @entity3 veterans who have killed themselves since the war ended has been laid bare			1
an authoritative study of the emotional and mental cost of the conflict discovered 95 troops who fought in the @entity9 had committed suicide since 1982			1
but while grim , the findings undermined the claim made by the @entity13 in 2002 that more @entity3 veterans had taken their own life than the 255 soldiers who died on the battlefield			2
@entity18 , pictured here drinking after the battle of @entity20 , was found dead in his car in january police believe @entity18 , who was found six miles from his home , died of carbon monoxide poisoning the @entity13 had said in 2002 it was ‘ almost certain ’ the number of suicides exceeded the conflict death toll			0
but campaigners insisted it still proved more needed to be done to tackle post-traumatic stress disorder and mental illness caused by horrors of war			1
commodore @entity34 , chief executive of veterans ’ mental health charity @entity36 , said : ‘ the number of @entity40 war suicides this study reveals is too many ‘ indeed , any suicide which is directly linked to service in the @entity44 is too many			1
‘ but what this study does , for the first time , is help us understand the needs of veterans and impact of psychological injuries long after the guns fall silent			0
@entity54 with his wife @entity55 , 51 , daughter @entity56 , at 23 and son @entity57 ‘ what we see is quite a lot of veterans who talk about or are concerned about suicide			1
they do n’t follow through but it is still a cry for help			0
’ military charities believe the @entity66 is facing a ‘ ticking timebomb ’ of ex-servicemen who are suffering potentially life - changing mental disorders following intense conflicts			1
in january , @entity71 – who featured in iconic film footage celebrating victory at the battle of @entity20 – was found died six miles from his home in @entity76 , @entity77			0
the father - of - two went missing as news bulletins were featuring the latest demands by president @entity81 for @entity66 to surrender the @entity3			1
television reports included the @entity20 footage of @entity18 and fellow paratroopers			0
he was shown smiling at the camera and drinking from a bottle of @entity88			0
the same clip featured in the 2006 film @entity90 and @entity91 , the 2011 film about former prime minister @entity93			0
@entity18 served with @entity94 in the @entity3 , and previously in @entity95			0
troops who do not get help for mental illnesses often face problems including homelessness , social exclusion , mental health problems , drug and alcohol abuse and fall into crime			0
the @entity106 announced in 2010 that it would investigate the circumstances of 21,432 @entity3 veterans three decades after the war			1
the aim was to find out whether suicide rates were more common than in the general population			2
the study , up to the end of december 2012 , found that 1,335 @entity3 troops had died , compared to an estimated 2,079 deaths if they had experienced the same mortality rate as the general @entity66 population			1
it meant the veterans had a 36 per cent lower risk of dying			0
of those @entity3 veterans , 95 - or 7 per cent - had killed themselves or a coroner had recorded an open verdict			2
that meant the veterans were 35 per cent less likely to kill themselves than the general population over the three decades			0
an @entity106 spokesman said : ‘ every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families and relatives of all those lost who bravely served in the @entity3 conflict			2
a view of @entity20 , the @entity40 settlement which was recaptured from @entity138 forces by paratroopers from the @entity140 in may 1982 the @entity142 flag flying over @entity143 , @entity144 , for the first time after the @entity9 started after being hoisted by @entity146 , @entity147 ‘ whilst this extensive study suggests that the rate of suicide amongst those who served in the conflict is in fact lower than the @entity66 civilian population we are clear that the mental health of our personnel and veterans remains a top priority			1
’ he said the government had committed £ 7.2million to improve mental health support for military personnel , including creating a 24 - hour helpline in conjunction with @entity36			1
the spokesman added : ‘ we would encourage any @entity3 veterans or serving personnel who need help to come forward to access the wide range of support available			2
’ veterans or their families can call the helpline on 0800 138 1619 .			0
