@entity0 has questioned whether @entity1 have the mental strength to complete an unbeaten season as he warned @entity4 are out to wreck their ‘ invincible ’ ambitions			1
the @entity6 , who excelled in @entity4 ’s 1 - 0 defeat against @entity9 , was part of the @entity12 side that marched imperiously through the 2003 - 04 campaign without losing a game in the @entity15			1
it has become a source of debate as to whether @entity20 ’s current squad can replicate that achievement following their flying start , with another question being how many trophies @entity1 will actually win			2
@entity0 ( right ) impressed during @entity4 's defeat to @entity9 in the @entity26 @entity27 ( right ) scored the winner for @entity9 as they eased into the knockout stages @entity0 , though , has explained how difficult it is to see off all - comers and predicted that the biggest tests still await @entity1 , despite them having travelled to @entity35 and the @entity36 already			1
next up for @entity1 is a collision with @entity4 on saturday lunchtime and there is much riding on the outcome of that contest , particularly given the history between the two clubs			1
the wounds @entity1 inflicted on april 27 this year when winning 2 - 0 , after all , are still fresh			1
‘ @entity1 have a good team , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ with the squad they have of course they can do it , but its not the only quality			0
every game is challenging and sometimes things do n’t go well for you but you need to be able to come back and carry on fighting			0
the season has just started			2
@entity1 continued their unbeaten @entity15 run against @entity60 last weekend @entity12 went a whole season unbeaten in 2003/04 and @entity1 have been tipped to follow suit ‘ it ’s a great chance ( to end the argument ) ! but the most important is we want to win the game			1
it ’s a very important game when you think what they do to us last season , that cost us the league and now we have the chance to beat them			2
i ca n’t wait for that , honestly			0
‘ every game for @entity4 you want to win and @entity1 are playing well now			1
when you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams			0
@entity1 attack and @entity4 attack as well			1
i think you are going to see a great game			0
we want to win ‘ this season they will attack … with the players they have they ca n’t defend all the time			2
i think they will just try to score goal and we will try to score goals			0
it ’s going to be a great game , definitely			0
’ @entity93 famously slipped , allowing @entity94 to score for @entity1 as @entity4 lost 2 - 0 in april @entity94 ( left ) raced through and calmly finished past @entity95 to give @entity1 the lead back in april having been out in the cold for most of the season , starting only in @entity100 games against @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity0 seized his chance to impress @entity104 in the @entity105 and he hopes to have given his manager a dilemma			1
‘ i was talking to somebody ( before game in @entity9 ) and i was saying that @entity110 wo n’t score … and he did n’t score ! ’ @entity0 said with a smile			2
‘ at the end of the day , we could have gone with a draw but we are still there			0
we will do everything to win those two [ group ] games coming			0
‘ i ’m ready for @entity1			2
any position , i am ready to fight for my club , i play from my heart , that is what is important			0
it does n’t matter which players play we will give 100 per cent			0

@entity0 was part of @entity12 team that went the whole season unbeaten
@entity4 welcome @entity1 to @entity130 on saturday lunchtime
