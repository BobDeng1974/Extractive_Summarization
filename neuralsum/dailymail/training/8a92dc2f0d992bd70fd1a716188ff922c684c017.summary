by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:09 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 4 june 2013 @entity2 would be broken up into a good bank and a bad bank under radical plans to be considered by @entity6			2
toxic loans which might never be repaid would be placed in the ‘ bad ’ arm while the profitable business could be sold off under proposals expected to be set out by a powerful commission of mps and peers			0
however , the chancellor is understood to be ready to resist the idea , preferring to sell off the taxpayer - backed bank even if it means making a loss			1
split : a powerful commission of mps and peers is reportedly planning to call for @entity2 to broken up into a good and bad bank the @entity22 is set to back the idea of splitting @entity2 , according to the @entity24			1
the @entity26 government owns 82 per cent of @entity2 , after the £ 66billion bailout in 2008 which also took a 39 per cent stake in @entity29			1
mr @entity6 is prepared to sell the government ’s at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in @entity26 history			0
allies hope the sell - off could come before the 2015 general election to give the public a chance to take a stake in the lenders			1
a long - awaited report from the @entity22 was sent to its members in the last week and they have until monday to read it through , with a final report due by the end of the month			1
@entity6 has warned of ' very considerable obstacles ' to the idea of splitting @entity2 however , mr @entity6 has warned of ‘ very considerable obstacles ’ to the idea , which would involve spending up to £ 9billion in taxpayers ’ money to buy up shares the government does not yet own			0
however outgoing @entity54 governor sir @entity53 has supported the idea of a break - up			2
former @entity58 chancellor @entity57 , who sits on the @entity22 , argued that nationalisation followed by a split would enable the government to boost lending and re-privatise the ‘ good ’ bank more quickly			1
and archbishop of canterbury @entity64 has asked whether the government ’s ‘ lack of will to break up the banks ’ was a ‘ recipe for a repetition of the disasters of the last few years ’			0
@entity2 itself has claimed it is well on the road to recovery , despite reporting losses of £ 5.2 billion for 2012 , driven by a £ 390 million settlement for rate - fixing , £ 1.1 billion provision for mis - selling and it glitches			0
yesterday it emerged @entity2 shrunk its net lending by £ 1.6 billion from january to march this year , but has borrowed £ 750 million from the funding for lending scheme designed to boost loans to businesses			0
@entity2 chairman sir @entity86 said on presenting full - year results that the institution ’s recovery would be ‘ substantially complete ’ by the middle of 2014 , paving the way for its return to the private sector			0
supporters of a break - up see it as a way of freeing the bank from long - standing bad debts , which could help it to lend more to businesses and boost the economy			1
the move is also said to be favoured by the commission as a way of increasing potential investor confidence in the ‘ good ’ part of the bank and increasing the chance of a successful reprivatisation			0
backers : the idea of breaking up @entity2 is backed by former @entity58 chancellor @entity57 ( left ) and outgoing @entity54 governor sir @entity53 the so - called ‘ bad ’ bank would be held on to by the government , avoiding the need for a fire sale of the more toxic assets and allowing them to recover in value			1
but the @entity121 is reportedly considering the alternative of transferring the group ’s troubled @entity124 operations to the @entity127 government in an effort to shore up @entity2 ’s balance sheet			0
the commission ’s recommendation could potentially be watered down by the time of its final report , but if not , the chancellor would face a difficult dilemma			0
there has also been mounting speculation over the government ’s plans for @entity140 after shares have recently risen above the 61.2p level at which the government said it would break even on its 2008 bailout			1
a @entity121 spokesman said : ' the government ’s policy remains that @entity2 continues to become a stronger and safer bank that supports the @entity26 economy , which in time can be returned to full private ownership when it ’s in the interests of the taxpayer to do so			2
' as the chancellor has said , we need functioning banks supporting the real economy instead of nursing their wounds , and we will set out the way ahead once the @entity159 has completed its work			2

taxpayer owns *81* *%* of troubled bank after 2008 bailout
chancellor wants to privatise it ahead of 2015 election - even if it means making a loss
@entity22 expected to recommend break up
