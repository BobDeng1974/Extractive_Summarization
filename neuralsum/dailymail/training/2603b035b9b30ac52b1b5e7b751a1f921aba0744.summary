by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 10:54 est , 22 march 2013 staff at a zoo in @entity3 are watching their step after a highly dangerous snake escaped from its enclosure			1
@entity8 's black mamba - one of the fastest and most venomous snakes in the world - is believed to be hiding somewhere in the zoo grounds after it was reported missing over a week ago			1
now , desperate staff at the zoo in @entity3 's capital are using infra - red cameras in a bid to find the six - and - a - half foot ( two metre ) missing reptile - before it finds one of them			1
@entity3 's most feared snake : @entity8 's black mamba is missing from its enclosure marketing manager @entity23 said he hoped the snake was hiding in the roof of a service building behind its terrarium			1
staff have placed snacks of rats , mice and chicks in the service area in a bid to tempt the snake out , but it has yet to bite			1
mr @entity23 's team is using cameras which can pick up radiation emitted by bodies and even objects as cold - blooded as killer snakes			2
another theory is that the snake may have been stolen			2
zoo staff say there is a trade for indigenous reptiles such as @entity48 , as they have named the missing mamba			1
however despite the uncertainty over the snake 's whereabouts , a friday night zoo tour and sleepover at the attraction are still going to go ahead - albeit at a distance from the snake enclosure , and with guards on hand			1
mr @entity23 told @entity60 live : ' we would like to assure the public of our utmost commitment to resolving this issue as quickly as possible			0
black mambas can kill lions with just one bite thanks to the powerful venom in their fangs ' there is no additional threat to the public			0
' the @entity73 hunts planned for @entity73 weekend will also go ahead			2
hundreds of children are expected to flock to the zoo to hunt for 20,000 chocolate eggs			0
bites from the black mamba nearly always result in the victim 's death			0
black mambas are known as @entity3 's most feared snakes , and with good reason			0
just two drops of their venom can kill a human , and they have up to 20 drops in their fangs			0
the venom contains a fast - acting neurotoxin that paralyses and kills it prey			0
such is its strength , black mambas can kill a lion with just one bite .			0

six - and - a - half foot snake has been missing from its enclosure for a week
@entity8 staff fear it is either hiding in the roof or has been stolen
a sleepover at the zoo *tonight* will go ahead for those *brave* enough
