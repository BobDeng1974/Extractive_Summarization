@entity1 ’s sensational stoppage of all - time middleweight great @entity2 forces another revision of this column ’s world pound - for - pound ratings			1
now the first in the heroic history of @entity8 fighting men to win world titles in four different weight divisions , @entity1 climbs back into boxing ’s elite			2
when they fought in @entity15 two weekends ago @entity2 was clearly past his prime , his phenomenal athleticism limited by the succession of injuries which had kept him out of the ring for almost a year			2
sensational : @entity1 surprisingly stopped @entity2 and climbed back into boxing 's elite champion : @entity1 would be too mobile for @entity24 and would beat the @entity25 , says @entity26 nevertheless the @entity27 remains a master of his craft and forcing his corner to pull him out in the tenth represents a considerable triumph			1
@entity1 looked to be on the wane himself after he was taken apart by @entity34 a couple of years ago but such is the fraternity of the hardest game that he has the @entity34 to thank for his renaissance			1
the pair have sparred frequently since @entity1 was taken on by @entity34 ’s master trainer @entity26			1
their sessions at @entity26 ’s @entity44 gym in @entity45 gave @entity46 – the best possible coaching put into practice courtesy of one of the two greatest boxers of our time			2
@entity26 says : ‘ i was confident @entity1 was going to beat @entity2 and of course it pleases me that he ’s made me look good while doing it			1
’ helping hand : @entity34 has let @entity1 train in his @entity44 gym , with successful results strong words : @entity26 reckons the new , improved @entity1 would knock out @entity24 1 ) @entity24 ( unchanged ) 2 ) @entity34 ( unchanged ) 3 ) @entity62 ( unchanged ) 4 ) @entity63 ( unchanged ) 5 ) @entity64 ( unchanged ) 6 ) @entity65 ( up 1 ) 7 ) @entity66 ( up 1 ) 8 ) @entity1 ( new ) 9 ) @entity67 ( unchanged ) 10 ) @entity68 ( unchanged ) with @entity34 now back in the big - time following his brilliant reversal of that scandalous decision given against him and favour of @entity67 , @entity26 ’s stock is now sky - high again			1
he gives much of the credit for his remarkable defiance of parkinson ’s disease to the adrenalin generated by the rigours of the sport and @entity1 is supplying an additional surge			0
he has also given his career and earning potential a significant boost			0
although the closeness of their professional relationship makes a return match with @entity34 unlikely , @entity1 could be back in the mix for a chance to avenge his 2012 defeat by @entity24			1
@entity26 says : ‘ the new @entity1 , with his improved movement , would be too mobile for @entity24 now and i believe he would knock him out			1
’ all powerful reasons for welcoming him to the top 10			0
i bring him in at eighth , which with @entity2 dropping out serves to lift @entity66 another place higher to seventh in this list ( above right )			0
@entity99 goes by the ring moniker @entity101 and it always looked as if he would be walking into the den of his feline namesakes in @entity15 on saturday night			0
and so it was that although the brave boy from @entity108 had only been off his feet once before , in his only previous defeat , he was on the wrong end of a mauling by @entity113 ’s @entity112			0
a bridge too far : @entity99 was well beaten in @entity15 by @entity112 since he had been decked in the first and the third rounds and was taking a beating , it might have been a kindness had his corner pulled @entity120 out at the end of the sixth			2
but the inevitable stoppage was delayed only for another minute and 19 seconds			0
@entity120 had said himself that he considered @entity112 to be the weakest of the 154lb belt holders			0
so the sad conclusion has to be that although he is fine competitor at domestic and @entity129 level , he may be just short of world class .			0

@entity2 past his prime but @entity1 's victory was still huge
@entity1 looked to be on the wane after losing to @entity34
but @entity8 got back on track by using @entity34 's gym
@entity26 reckons @entity1 could knock out @entity24
@entity99 fell short in beating by @entity112
