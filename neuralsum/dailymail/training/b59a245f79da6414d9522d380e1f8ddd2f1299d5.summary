by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 09:51 est , 8 october 2012 a mother whose 11 - year - old son sneaked aboard a passenger jet then flew to @entity5 alone is furious after three airline staff were told they would all keep their jobs			1
@entity9 jumped on a plane at @entity11 and travelled over 1,000 miles without a passport , cash or boarding pass			1
three @entity16 workers were suspended in the wake of the incident , and warned they could be dismissed while the airline reviewed procedures at all their @entity22 airports			1
but today it emerged the staff members had been told they will not lose their jobs and are back at work after being retrained			2
jetsetter : @entity9 with his mother @entity27 , who is furious that @entity16 staff have not been sacked after the 11 - year - old sneaked on to a plane at @entity11 @entity5 alone : @entity9 managed to get on to the plane even though he had no passport or boarding pass @entity9 ’s mother @entity27 , 30 , said : ' i ’m disgusted with @entity16			1
three months on and i have not even had so much as an apology			0
i still have n’t had a letter , any correspondence or anything			0
' that would have been the bare minimum that i would have expected after my son got half way to @entity5 before anyone realised			0
' it ’s a disgrace that these people can be reinstated after what happened and that ’s what i find hard to understand - this was a vulnerable child who was by himself			1
she added : ' i knew that the staff were being investigated and i was hoping that the outcome would be that someone would be held accountable and sacked for it			2
' at the end of the day they let a child who was alone get through all the security and on to a flight heading to @entity5			0
' it ’s a disgrace and i ’m very angry that the staff have not been sacked and have only been re-trained			1
i think it ’s outrageous and i still ca n’t get my head around it			0
' they put my son ’s life at risk by not doing their job properly and checking			0
alarm bells should have been ringing			0
' i really do dread to think what could have happened if he ’d got out of @entity5 airport			0
i do n’t think i would ever have seen him again			0
' @entity76 said he climbed on to the @entity16 plane looking for a toilet after slipping away from his mother near to @entity11 @entity9 from @entity80 , near @entity81 , @entity11 evaded five separate checks to board the plane at @entity83 after giving his mother the slip at a shopping centre near her her home			1
he was only noticed by staff after the aircraft had taken off , and he spent two hours in the airport in @entity5 as the plane 's crew were quizzed by @entity93 authorities			1
@entity9 was brought back on the return flight and reunited with his mother			1
mrs @entity27 added : ' thousands of people pass through that airport and i thought that it was meant to be one of the top ones for security , especially because the @entity100 were approaching and security was meant to have been upped			0
' they could have let anyone through			0
' they should have done a head check when people boarded the plane but that never happened			2
i ’m glad that this procedure will be put back in place but it does not excuse what happened and that is what failed @entity9			2
' i ’ve still not had any answers about how he ended up on the plane before he was spotted			2
i ’d like to ask them how he got through without a passport and boarding pass			2
' she added : ' thankfully i got my son back but it could have been much worse and i ’d hate to think that it could happen to another child , especially if these people are still employed			0
@entity9 on a less jet - setting holiday : as a toddler riding on a donkey in @entity128 ' @entity9 could have got all the way to @entity5 and i dread to think what could have happened , he could have ended up dead			1
' he got through five security checks and when he got to the one where the body scanner is they just told him to put his hands out and he said they said " off you go "			0
' he was not stopped by anyone official and there must have been hundreds of people passing through who were going on their holidays who did n’t stop him			0
' as part of its review @entity16 reinstated a headcount of passengers on every flight after it emerged that crews did not routinely carry out the check and concluded that this was the main reason why @entity9 was not spotted sooner			1
the practice is not legally required by the @entity154 - whose rules state the final check can be cabin crew checking boarding cards as passengers get on the plane from a walkway			1
a spokesman for @entity16 said the incident had been ‘ thoroughly investigated ' and all staff involved had been retrained and were still employed by the airline			1
he added : ' following a full and thorough investigation , revised procedures have been implemented			2
' head counts are now in place across each of our flights from all airports , including those where airbridges are in use , and additional staff training has been carried out across the business			0
' we continue to liaise closely with @entity11 regarding security processes			2
' aviation security expert @entity180 said : ' the fact that the @entity182 has not come forward with an investigation would suggest that the actions taken by @entity16 are proportionate given the risk involved			1

@entity9 sneaked away from his mother near @entity11 - and managed to board a plane without a passport or boarding card
three @entity16 workers suspended - but *re-instated* after investigation
@entity9 's mother @entity195 said it was a ' disgrace ' the staff had been reinstated
