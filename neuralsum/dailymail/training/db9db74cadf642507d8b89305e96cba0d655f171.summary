it was just an average day in the @entity1 according to one local man , whose car trip was interrupted by an unexpected visitor			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , was driving from the @entity7 to @entity8 for a weekend fishing trip at about 9pm when he was forced to stop at the main crossing where a four metre long crocodile was lazing about			1
' it just would n't move , ' mr @entity5 told @entity13			1
' the video shows an enormous crocodile resting on the left side of the road , unmoving			0
after some shouting and flashing of lights , the fierce animal finally began to retreat into the grass by the side of the road , allowing the car to pass by			0
but the spectacle is a normal one in @entity36 according to mr @entity5 , who said he often catches sight of the reptiles at his favourite fishing location			1
' it 's pretty run of the mill , he 's just a little extra big , ' he said of the event			0
mr @entity5 said crocodiles were a regular sight in the area and that the only thing that was strange about this particular encounter was the sheer size of the reptile ' i was just worried that he could have done a fair bit of damage to the car			2
' the fisherman certainly appeared quite unperturbed in his recording , in which his companion could be heard calling out : ' move out of the way '			0
' we 've got a crocodile in the way , ' mr @entity5 is heard saying before the croc finally darts off the road , at which point his friend is heard saying : ' bye , bye gypsy ' .			2

the four - metre - long croc was resting at the main crossing at @entity36
