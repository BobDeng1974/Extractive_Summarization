by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale some members of the @entity3 board want @entity4 to appear before them to explain @entity7 ’s horrendous @entity6 performance			1
the @entity3 confirmed on wednesday there would be no official inquiry into the shambles but instead a continuous analysis of what went wrong and where to make changes before @entity15			2
this is the first sign of discontent within the @entity33 high command at how events unfolded at the @entity6 in @entity29 at a time when the @entity3 insist that full confidence in @entity4 remains intact			1
there is also board sympathy for the strategy — advocated by members of the @entity3 ’s defunct international committee — that @entity7 managers ’ contracts should always run from one major tournament to the next with any extension governed by performances			0
and what is certain is that the @entity3 board ’s backing for @entity4 , whose deal runs until 2016 , would not be so solid if someone like @entity53 ’s @entity52 were available			0
out : @entity7 were knocked out of the @entity6 after losing their first two @entity55 matches			0

@entity3 members was @entity4 to explain @entity7 's @entity6 exit
the @entity3 confirmed that there would be no official inquiry into the shambles
