by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 23 february 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 23 february 2013 hit : @entity1 and mr @entity2 were once the main attraction of saturday early evening television and now @entity5 wants to replicate their success @entity5 is planning to launch an ambitious game show – billed as a cross between @entity10 and the generation game – which would see him dominating saturday night tv			1
@entity5 , 53 , is putting together a pitch for the as yet unnamed project with his television production company @entity15			2
it would air over the autumn tv season in the teatime slot that was once home to mr @entity2			0
the programme , which could be on screen as early as september 2014 , is expected to be the subject of a fierce bidding war between @entity24 and @entity25			1
both channels are keen to fill the slot before their peak - time reality shows @entity29 and @entity30 with a ratings - winning series			0
it could mean @entity5 , who is believed to be worth £ 200 million and is in negotiations to keep @entity30 on @entity24 , controlling up to four hours of saturday night television			1
the new family show – like @entity30 – would run for two hours			1
a production source said : ‘ there are lots of ideas being talked about but this is the one that we are most excited about			0
‘ the series would be a family - style game show , featuring parents and their children competing for prizes in quizzes and games in a similar vein to something like @entity10 , @entity54 or @entity55			1
‘ it is not a reality tv format in any way			0
the idea is for it to run in an early - evening weekend slot , probably on saturday nights , starting around 5.30 to 6pm when families have got in for the evening and are watching together			2
' it ’s not a replacement for something like @entity30 – it would run before that			0
‘ it is still at a very early stage but once the programme is more polished and ready to be taken to commissioners , we would be having talks with all the broadcasters , not just @entity24			2
’ the saturday teatime slot is a crucial battleground in the autumn ratings war , with peak - time shows such as @entity29 and @entity30 boosted by inheriting millions of viewers from programmes earlier in the evening			0

the series drew audiences of nearly seven million			0
@entity24 has a £ 100 million deal with @entity5 to screen @entity30 and its sister series @entity108 , which stars @entity87 , @entity86 and @entity85 as judges			2
the current deal expires at the end of this year and negotiations are believed to be under way about keeping both programmes on air in 2014			0
