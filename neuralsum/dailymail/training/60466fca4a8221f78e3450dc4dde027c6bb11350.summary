now , the most famous ditty in the @entity13 language has found itself in the middle of a legal battle after a film production company filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the copyright protecting the song			2
the proposed class action asks a federal court to declare the song to be in the public domain and that @entity24 , the music publishing arm of @entity25 , return ‘ millions of dollars of unlawful licensing fees ’ it has collected for reproductions and public performances of the song			1
songwriters : the simple four - line ditty was written in 1893 by @entity32 and @entity33 , two sisters from @entity35 , @entity36 , and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teachers ‘ more than 120 years after the melody to which the simple lyrics of “ @entity10 ” is set was first published , defendant @entity25 / @entity41 boldly , but wrongfully and unlawfully , insists that it owns the copyright to “ @entity10 , ” ’ the lawsuit said			1

’ but if you want to use it in a television show , a movie , or a television commercial , you 'll pay anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 30,000 for those rights			0
’ @entity87 , who wrote a 68 - page article about the song , told @entity102 in 2008 that one of the weaknesses of the copyright case is the murky authorship of the ' @entity10 ' song			1
the other is the fact that the song 's owner failed to properly renew the copyright on the standard version of the ditty in the 1960s , thus opening the door on a legal challenge			1
