@entity0 has urged @entity1 to chase a ' once - in - a - lifetime opportunity ' in @entity3 next season if excluded from @entity7 's @entity6 squad			1
@entity0 believes former @entity8 team - mate @entity1 must not fall into the trap of ' hanging on ' too long in the hope of rekindling his @entity7 career			1
sale fly - half @entity1 is expected to be named in @entity7 's second - string @entity15 squad on wednesday , in a senior snub that could lead him to join @entity17 in the summer			1
the decision to omit @entity19 playmaker @entity1 may prompt him to move across the @entity21 next season 27 - year - old @entity1 posted this on his @entity23 , proving he is working hard on his fitness at @entity25 talisman centre @entity26 could miss the entire @entity6 with continued groin trouble , while @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 are primed to be selected at fly - half ahead of @entity1			1
' i think the problem is you can be hanging on your entire life , ' former @entity33 flanker @entity0 told @entity38 of @entity1 's position			1
' sometimes your face does n't fit , or there 's too much competition around , and you need to make the right decision to suit yourself and suit your game			0
@entity7 head coach @entity46 will announce his @entity6 squad on wednesday the @entity7 head coach has twice assured @entity1 that he remains in his plans in the past two weeks ' i do n't regret one minute going to @entity3 , it was one of the best experiences of my life			1
' if i thought it would have affected my @entity7 chances , because the rules were different then , then i probably would n't go			2
' if i was on the fringe of the squad looking to play rugby and i had a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to go and play in @entity3 , you 've got to go and play in @entity3 , have n't you ? ' i think that 's what you 've got to do			2
only he knows what the @entity7 coaches are saying to him , only he knows his own situation			0
' but i respect anyone who broadens their horizons , @entity67 chose to go to @entity71			0
@entity8 flanker @entity0 claims playing rugby in @entity3 is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity ' the worst thing you can do is get to 33 having hung on and still not really been involved , then gone over and miss the entire boat			1
' @entity0 believes nine - cap @entity1 will face a difficult decision on whether to move across the channel in the summer if deemed @entity7 's fourth - choice fly - half			1
@entity7 stick rigidly to the policy of not selecting overseas - based players unless in ' exceptional circumstances '			2
' @entity29 ( @entity84 ) has been eased in and turned out to be outstanding , ' said @entity0			0
the 29 - year - old , in action for club side @entity8 , is set to be named in @entity88 's @entity7 @entity6 squad ' @entity1 's unlucky because there are some very good 10s about , i think he has been unlucky not to be involved as much and it must be frustrating for him - because he would get into most teams or most squads , but @entity7 are blessed with some good backs			1
' i 've no doubt that if he keeps sticking with it he will keep knocking at that door because a couple of injuries and he 's right in the mix. ' but i think certainly he has the skill - set , the attitude now and the ability to perform			0
' @entity106 's @entity105 could step up to fill the void from @entity109 's leg break at number eight , while 36 - year - old @entity111 has been pressing for a recall with his form at @entity114			1
@entity0 has settled at openside flanker at @entity8 , but said he is ready to fill the number - eight breach as back - up to @entity117 if required			2
@entity111 is another in - form player who needs a last - minute change of heart from @entity7 â€™s coaches ' i 'd do it without thinking about it , ' he said			2
' i 've played what i think are some of my best games for @entity7 at eight			2
but you never know what 's going to happen			0
' i think there is enough cover in the squad to cope with the injuries			0
' @entity130 is interesting because everyone chats about him , but he 's contracted abroad and knows the rules			0
' @entity111 's been playing well for a while and his addition to the squad if it happened would be a good one			0
' but i think there are other number eights out there playing well who could slot in there			0
' essentially it 's more about the balance of the back - row than the numbers on the shirts			0

27 - year - old fly - half last played for @entity7 in @entity149 last june
@entity46 names his @entity6 @entity7 squad on wednesday
@entity0 spent two years in @entity3 with @entity33 from 2009 - 11
