by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 05:44 est , 3 january 2014 @entity1 has launched an impassioned defence of the @entity4 's enduring appeal and described it as having ' a philosophy that allows everyone to dream			1
' the @entity8 boss knows all about the @entity4 's ability to make dreams come true after leading @entity11 to a shock 1 - 0 win over @entity14 in last may 's @entity16 final			1
as he prepared for a third - round tie with @entity18 at @entity19 , he made it clear he was at odds with @entity24 manager @entity23 's claim that it was an ' unwanted distraction			1
' holders : @entity1 holds the @entity4 as @entity11 manager after upsetting the odds at @entity16 @entity28 v @entity14 ( 12.45pm ) @entity29 1 @entity32 v @entity30 ( 5.15pm ) @entity33 sunday @entity35 v @entity34 ( 12pm ) @entity33 @entity37 v @entity36 ( 2.15pm ) @entity29 1 @entity39 v @entity38 ( 4.30pm ) @entity29 1 reflecting on the way his @entity11 side defied the odds last season , and how he joined a club with a rich @entity4 tradition when he agreed to take over from @entity46 in the summer , @entity1 said : ' it is unique			1
every country has a knock - out competition , but there is nothing in the football world that compares with the @entity4			2
' it is unique in its unpredictability and also in its philosophy that anyone is entitled to chase a dream			0
we are going to give it everything we have got , here at @entity8 , and we are all looking forward to third - round weekend			0
@entity64 man : but @entity1 hinted that the likes of @entity66 may be rested for the @entity18 clash controversial : @entity23 risks the wrath of @entity24 fans after saying his side could do without the @entity4 ' do i understand @entity23 's comments ? i can understand what he is saying , because every manager knows his squad and the numbers at his disposal			1
i am looking at 21 or 22 players who are all ready to represent @entity8 , and that excites me			0
' but if you 've got 11 players , and you are facing two cup competitions , as well as a @entity85 programme , it is a different matter			0
' each manager has to assess the situation and make his own decision			0
' i have seen for myself that a good run in the @entity4 can generate competition for places , and that can have a beneficial effect			1
' it can present an opportunity for a young player , and suddenly he becomes a regular in the side by grabbing it with both hands			0
' it is vital to the fans that we try and win a trophy , and i am very aware that the association between @entity8 and the @entity4 is quite remarkable			1
i am fascinated by the links between this club and the @entity4 over the years			0
' i have read all about the 1933 final being the first one where numbers were worn , how @entity8 wore one to 11 and their opponents 12 to 22 and how that made @entity113 the first - ever no 9			0
' more recently , how the @entity4 was the first trophy for @entity115 and for @entity116			2
' so the @entity4 and @entity8 have had a beautiful relationship , and i am excited about the challenge of trying to add a few more chapters to the success story			2

@entity1 looking for @entity4 run to boost *confidence* and competition
