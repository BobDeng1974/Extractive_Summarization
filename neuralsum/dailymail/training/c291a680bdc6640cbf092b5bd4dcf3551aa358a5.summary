spectacles for horses , a bicycle railway and a steam - powered man that can pull carts filled with people			1
these are just some of the wacky inventions that were designed by innovative victorians looking to make the next big technological breakthrough			0
they are documented in a series of black - and - white illustrations that were uncovered by @entity13 , an author and family historian from @entity15 , @entity16			1
bizarre breakthroughs : the steam man , left , was invented by a @entity20 professor in 1893 to pull wagons filled with people			0
the sunshade , right , was designed in 1885 for @entity25 soldiers fighting in the @entity27 desert future of commuting ? those using the bicycle railway , pictured , pedaled on an inverted bike that rode along a single track on top of a wooden fence			1
plans for the innovative network were scrapped after five years mrs @entity13 came across the images in a collection of rare magazines from the late 1880s while carrying out research for the genealogy company she runs with her husband , @entity42			1
she said : ' the volume was packed with articles about everyday life in @entity47 times , and as soon as i saw the illustrations of the latest inventions of the day , i was hooked			1
' i loved their charm and quaintness , as well as the diversity of technology , from an automatic egg - boiling machine , which was no doubt the @entity47 housewife 's dream , to a steamship made out of paper ! ' diagrams of hundreds of long - forgotten inventions are published alongside insights into @entity47 life in mrs @entity13 's book , @entity65 : @entity66			1
one striking illustration taken from the book shows the steam - powered man , which was invented in about 1893 by a @entity20 professor named @entity71			1
professor @entity71 dreamed that all tasks would one day be carried out by robots and set about building a mechanical man , made of steel and tin and powered entirely by steam , that would pull a wagon filled with commuters through city streets			0
seeing things more clearly : mr @entity83 , from the opticians @entity83 & @entity84 , developed a set of bi-focal spectacles for horses , shown in the photograph , in order that the animal might see distant objects more clearly the futuristic figure was said to have stood six feet tall and could walk at a brisk pace of five miles an hour			0
the trunk of the figure , which looked like a knight in armour , contained the furnace , boiler and engine , and the limbs the mechanisms for walking			0
it is not known what became of the steam man			0
while professor @entity71 's endeavours in early robotics amounted to a quirky one - off piece , other early @entity47 inventors came closer to reaching the mass market			1
inspired by the success of the railroad , an unnamed @entity114 inventor from @entity115 , came up with the idea of a bicycle railway			0
his single rail was mounted on a wooden fence , and an inverted bicycle - with wheels above the handlebars - was placed on top			2
saving lives ? the @entity127 lifebuoy ( left ) was a safety device that could be found on board @entity47 ships			0
right : a woman holds the hand - grenade fire extinguisher ( left hand ) , billed as a way to put out small house fires all - terrain vehicle : the road and river cycle was introduced in @entity114 for travelling across roads and rivers in a single vehicle , thereby eliminating the inconvenience of having to travel for miles around stretches of water there was no danger of falling of , and no need to use any form of steering , which meant commuters could freely look about and enjoy the scenery			1
it also combined exercise with travel			0
though plans were underway to double the track for coming and going passengers - and also to provide stations at intervals which offered fresh supplies of vehicles - the bicycle railway closed down just five years after its opening			2
similar trials were made in @entity164 across @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , but by the turn of the century this unusual mode of transportation fell out of favour and the tracks were ultimately dismantled			0
other inventions , like the sunshade that was designed for soldiers in the desert , sought to tackle smaller - scale problems			2
doomed : the aerodrome , pictured , was invented by professor @entity179			2
it crashed shortly after takeoff on its first flight , paving the way for the @entity184 to invent their own flying machine early animator : in 1893 a @entity188 inventor named @entity189 developed his own motion picture technique based on the same principle as the zoëtrope , above			1
he later transposed the same principle to drawings , and was ultimately responsible for showcasing the first ever animated cartoon at a public exhibition the sunshade was conceived by the women in the @entity199 , who wanted to make life more comfortable for the @entity25 soldiers involved in the bitter @entity203 of 1885			0
the drawing of the invention shows a man with a kind of sunshade made from paper and bamboo , worn as a virtually weightless backpack - leaving his hands free to carry a notepad and pen			2
mrs @entity13 said that while the majority of the inventions that are featured in her book were made by the inventors , very few of them stood the test the time			1
she said that her favourite invention is probably the first one she saw when she opened the book : an office chair railway			2
she said : ' it ran from a clerk 's desk to the different bookshelves in his office , so he did n't have to keep getting in and out of his seat all day			0
' i think it would be fun to re-invent that ! ' mrs @entity13 , who runs @entity233 with her husband , is now planning a follow - up book entitled @entity236 , which will be published next year			1
she added : ' people often see the @entity238 as stuffy and repressed , but really many of them were full of creative ideas , and in our modern technology - obsessed world i feel we owe a debt of gratitude to our 19th century forebears			0

@entity13 uncovered the illustrations in rare magazine collection
*remarkable* black - and - white images have been compiled into a book
