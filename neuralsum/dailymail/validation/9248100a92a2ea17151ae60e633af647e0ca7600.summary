it 's normally women accused of high maintenance beauty routines and spending hours to get ready			0
but are men starting to taking over as the main bathroom hogs ? in a new interview , @entity6 has revealed that although he takes just 15 minutes to get ready each morning , that 's only after he 's spent an hour or more indulging in a pampering regime			1
' if i have to be somewhere in the morning , the actual getting ready takes 15 minutes , ' @entity6 told @entity11			1
' @entity6 's far from ready to walk out of the door after his morning beverage ritual however , which consists of a double espresso and glass of water , for both a caffeine and hydration boost			2
next , comes jumping in the steam shower he has preheated , before tackling his hair and skin			0
he said : ' my hair is curly , so if i 'm , going somewhere on my own , not a work event , i will run the straighteners over it			0
i also use coconut oil as a moisturiser			0
' you can do anything with it - eat it , cook with it , use it on your skin			0
' who hogs the bathroom in this house ? part of @entity6 's morning routine involves preheating his steam shower for an hour while he drinks a cup of coffee in silence			1
so when does fianc√©e @entity53 ( right ) get her turn ? then , comes the agonising decision of what he 's going to wear each day			0
picking an outfit the night before just is n't an option for the popstar			0
instead , @entity6 needs to walk into his wardrobe and pick out clothes which match his mood for the day			2
' i could pick out a million things the night before , but if i wake up and i do n't feel as good as i did the day before , i wo n't want to wear any of it			0
' in contrast , @entity68 model and it girl @entity66 has said she can be up and out of the house in a mere seven minutes			1
@entity68 fashion icon @entity66 may give everyone style envy on the front row , but the model claims her daily ' getting ready ' routine takes her a mere seven minutes			1
pictured : @entity66 attends the @entity77 show during the @entity78 last month talking to @entity80 , the front row regular said , ' in real life , it 's around the seven - minute mark			2
but for fashion week , i try and put in a bit more of an effort			0
' for @entity66 however , more of an effort means just three minutes added to her normal routine			1
compared with @entity6 's painstaking grooming process , @entity66 's final @entity78 regime takes her a maximum of 10 minutes			1
@entity78 ready in 10 minutes or less ? it girl @entity66 claims that to get ready for big events like sitting front row at @entity78 , she needs just an extra three minutes of preening time			1

@entity6 reveals daily regime which takes over an hour to complete
model @entity66 however , takes less than 10 minutes to leave the house
are men now more likely to hog the bathroom than women ?
