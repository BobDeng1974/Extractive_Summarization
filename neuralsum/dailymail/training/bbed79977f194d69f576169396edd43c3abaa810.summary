a @entity1 try and @entity3 's subsequent conversion one minute from time gave @entity5 a 24 - 23 victory over @entity7 in a rain - soaked @entity9 encounter in @entity10			1
the @entity5 trailed @entity7 for much of the match but a 65th - minute yellow card for @entity13 , in his 100th test , swung the game in the hosts ' favour and their persistence paid off as the @entity7 defence finally buckled in the closing stages			0
the result , @entity5 's first win over @entity7 in the @entity9 in four attempts , means they also have their first victory of this year 's competition and will look forward to next saturday 's encounter against @entity28 in the @entity29 with renewed confidence			2
left it late : @entity32 and @entity33 celebrate @entity5 's dramatic victory over @entity7 try : @entity35 runs in for the @entity7 only score of the game battle : @entity5 and @entity7 players compete for the ball in a brutal encounter a fortnight to reflect on a 51 - 20 defeat to @entity44 in @entity45 saw @entity5 coach @entity46 replace @entity47 with @entity3 at fly - half and the men in gold made a blistering start as full - back @entity52 scored inside 90 seconds			1
inside centre @entity54 received quick ball from the breakdown , and having stepped inside opposite number @entity58 , he offloaded to @entity52 who gathered the low pass to dive over			0
@entity63 , also returning to the number 10 jersey in place of @entity66 , reduced the deficit to two points four minutes later when he kicked the first of his six penalties as the @entity5 were whistled by @entity72 referee @entity71 for not releasing			0
@entity35 put @entity7 into an 8 - 5 lead in the 13th minute , cutting inside from the right wing to touch down after the @entity7 stretched the hosts ' defence with some quick passing			0
all over : @entity5 's players celebrate their win eyes on the prize : @entity7 's @entity63 takes a kick at goal divine intervention : @entity35 celebrates his try pass master : @entity87 spins a pass out for @entity5 a marauding run by outside centre @entity90 resulted in a penalty for the @entity5 which @entity3 duly converted to square the match at 8 - 8 , but @entity7 were in front immediately from the restart when the @entity5 gave away a needless penalty			1
@entity63 's second penalty of the match stretched @entity7 's lead to 14 - 8 in the 25th minute , before @entity3 narrowed the gap to three points with his second penalty of the night shortly before the half - hour mark			2
that proved to be the final score of the half as @entity7 went into the interval with a 14 - 11 lead			0
@entity3 hit back with a penalty two minutes after the restart to square the match at 14 - 14 before a scrambling @entity5 defence was forced to concede another penalty which @entity63 kicked to return the @entity7 into the lead			2
the @entity115 lynchpin then stretched his side 's lead to 20 - 14 in the 49th minute after a collapsed scrum before he squeezed over his final penalty just after the hour - mark to stretch the visitors ' lead to nine points			0
stretching : @entity125 try scorer @entity124 competes for the ball with @entity35 solid : @entity5 's @entity32 and @entity7 's @entity129 clash in @entity10 the momentum then swung back in the hosts ' favour when @entity13 was sin - binned for a high tackle with 15 minutes left on the clock and @entity3 reduced @entity7 's winning margin to six points with his fourth penalty with 10 minutes to go			1
with the clock ticking down to full time , a fine , one - handed offload from @entity52 found @entity90 and he passed to @entity1 , who cut in from the left wing to score @entity5 's second try with less than two minutes to go before @entity3 held his nerve to slot the subsequent conversion to send the majority of those assembled in the @entity146 into a frenzy .			1

@entity1 's last gasp score - followed by @entity3 's conversion - earned @entity5 a dramatic win in @entity10
the boot of @entity63 looked like kicking @entity7 to a *crucial* victory
the *flyhalf* *bagged* *18* points to add to @entity35 ' try
@entity52 had scored a try for @entity5 in the first minute
@entity3 kicked four penalties as the home side claimed its first win of the *tournament*
@entity7 face @entity44 in @entity166 next saturday
need to win to retain *realistic* hopes of *clinching* the @entity9 trophy
