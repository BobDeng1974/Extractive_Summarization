‘ they know my feelings like i know their feelings			2
i have been here for four months , we know the players and the players know me			0
‘ we feel the same , very disappointed and frustrated , and not happy because our performance was not good enough			2
‘ it ’s clear we need to improve a lot			1
we need to improve and this is clear to analyse			1
always in football you need time , different methods and philosophy but we need to improve quick			2
‘ in football you never have time , a long time – you need to take a result			0
we need to find a solution quickly and in the next few weeks , we change our mentality and find a solution , this is my challenge in the next few weeks			0
’ @entity54 's late red card added salt to the wound on a day when @entity2 never really found their form @entity58 scored his first goal for @entity5 and their lead was doubled when @entity62 scored again before the break			1
@entity64 gave @entity2 hope with a brilliant volley , but their changes of snatching an equaliser were lost when @entity54 was given a straight red			1

@entity101 celebrates his side 's win at @entity12 after keeping faith in @entity58 , and being rewarded ‘ he has bided his time and i have just stared to reintroduce him now and he has had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs to and he looks a very accomplished player again			0
‘ we are going to benefit from his ability and his goal - scoring because he is a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field			2
he hits shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react early enough and he will score goals for us this year			0
