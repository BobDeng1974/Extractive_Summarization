by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 15:36 est , 10 june 2013 while the country ’s largest breast cancer charity , @entity5 , announced it was cancelling half its 3 - day races nationwide next year , ceo @entity2 ’s compensation package has increased considerably in the past two years			1
and at $ 684,000 , the pay itself is enough to raise eyebrows , not to mention @entity2 ’s 2012 announcement she would be stepping down as @entity5 ceo			1
her announcement came in august in the wake of the early 2012 controversy over the charity ’s short - lived decision to pull funding from @entity18 to provide breast cancer screenings			1
@entity2 has remained listed as the organization ’s ceo in the ten months since			0
the cause ? @entity5 founder @entity2 is under fire for her $ 684,000 paycheck as her organization cancels events nationwide due to flagging turnout according to @entity28 , @entity2 has received a 64 percent raise since 2010 despite a steep drop in donations made to the organizations and in participation in @entity5 ’s signature races nationwide			1
@entity5 says @entity2 ’s raise came prior to last year ’s defunding debacle			2
@entity5 spokesperson @entity36 told @entity37 ‘ did not receive a pay increase in 2011 and did not accept one in 2012 , nor will she receive one in 2013			2
‘ our ceo pay reflects the comprehensive and global nature of our work , ’ @entity36 continued			0
‘ we 're active in breast cancer programs in 30 countries			0
’ ' difficult to sustain ' : the group 's 3 - day walk , once a national event in 14 major cities , has been canceled in 14 of those cities for 2014 as participation and giving drop the @entity55 reported last week that @entity2 took the raise in november of 2010 , before which she took in $ 417,000 per year			1
despite the reach of the charity she founded , @entity2 ’s pay may not be in be in synch with its revenue			0
@entity63 , hers outweighs ceo pay at some of the largest @entity66 charities			0
at @entity68 , listed as the largest charity in the @entity66 by @entity70 in terms of donations received , total revenue was over $ 4.1 billion as of october 2012			0
@entity73 , a website billed as ‘ your guide to intelligent giving , ’ lists @entity68 ceo @entity79 ’s pay as $ 763,394			2
moving on ? the rankling over @entity2 's pay stands out after the @entity5 ceo said she would soon move in august 2012 but has remained in the position since charity navigator lists the pay of @entity85 , ceo of @entity70 ’ # 4 charity @entity86 , — which had a revenue of $ 1.2 billion as of october 2012 — at about $ 408,000			1
meanwhile , @entity5 for the @entity88 is listed at # 40 by @entity70 in terms of donations and had $ 327 million in revenue as of october			0
though her organization brings in about a third of that raised by @entity86 , @entity2 makes hundreds of thousands more than the @entity96 - based charity ’s head honcho			0
‘ this pay package is way outside the norm , ’ @entity73 ’s ceo @entity97 told @entity28			0
‘ it 's about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size , though @entity2 took a lot of heat after yanking funding to @entity18 for breast exams and all but resigned in 2012 , the ceo is still benefiting from a giant bump in pay she took in 2010			1
below is @entity2 's pay compared with that of ceo 's of @entity66 's far larger charities : @entity79 , ceo @entity115 , which had $ 4.14 billion in revenue as of october 2012			1
compensation : $ 763,394 @entity119 , ceo @entity120 , which had $ 3.65 billion in revenue as of october 2012			0
compensation : $ 501,122 @entity85 , ceo @entity86 , which had $ 1.18 billion in revenue as of october @entity126 : $ 408,958 @entity2 , ceo @entity5 , which had $ 327 million in revenue as of october 2012			1
compensation : $ 684,717 ‘ this is more than the head of the @entity120 is making for an organization that is one - tenth the size of the @entity120			0
’ @entity135 ’s site lists @entity120 ceo @entity119 ’s pay at just over $ 500,000			0
more in line with her pay are @entity2 's reportedly lavish lifestyle and taste			2
in 2012 , a @entity55 report titled ' @entity2 : a @entity143 , a scandal , and a @entity145 ' questioned @entity2 's previous earnings ( which the report listed as ' over $ 400,000 at @entity5 ) in light of a huge expense bill she sent the organization			1
according to the report , ' @entity2 billed the foundation for $ 133,507 in expenses from june 2007 to january 2009 , according to her filings with the @entity66 @entity155			1
' over that time period , @entity2 was doing more than working at @entity5 , however			2
under @entity156 , @entity2 was the chief of protocol for the @entity158 , a full - time position			1
@entity2 -- who was also ambassador to @entity160 from 2001 to 2003 -- returned to full - time work as @entity5 ceo at the conclusion of her time with the @entity164 , at which point some of her employees said things began to change			1
' it was like suddenly she expected someone to carry her purse , ' said one @entity55 source for the 2012 report , which sourced from ' a half - dozen former @entity5 employees who held a range of jobs at the charity			2
' ‘ an imposing figure who flies first class , prefers five - star hotels , and generally exhibits an entitled air ... employees do n’t call her “ @entity2 , ” ’ said the sources , ‘ they are expected to call her “ ambassador @entity2			0
” ’ @entity2 started the @entity5 foundation at the start of the 1980s to honor her sister , who lost her battle with breast cancer and for whom the organization is named			2
in her personal biography on the @entity5 website , @entity2 credits ex-husband @entity196 for her ability to grow the company so successfully			2
@entity196 , who @entity2 calls ' a brilliant entrepreneur who mentored and encouraged me ' made millions as founder of @entity202 , a pioneer in casual dining that housed such restaurants as @entity206 's , @entity207 's , @entity208 's , and @entity209 's			0
@entity2 , a resident of posh @entity210 , @entity211 , divorced the man who @entity66 can thank for the now - ubiquitous salad bar in 2003 , but the two remained business allies until his death in 2009			0
previously held in 14 cities , the 3 - day walk , billed on its @entity219 page as ‘ a 3 day , 60 - mile walk for women and men who want to make a personal difference in the fight against breast cancer , ’ will be held nationwide as planned in 2013			1
however , the event has been cancelled in 7 of those cities for 2014 and @entity5 blames a drop in participation			2
via the @entity219 page : ‘ we are saddened to share that the 3 - day will not be returning to the following markets in 2014 : @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity96 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 , @entity241 … while the 3 - day has brought great awareness to the breast cancer cause , participation levels over the last four years have made it difficult to sustain an event of this magnitude in 14 cities			1
’ the race will continue as planned in @entity249 , @entity250 / @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and the @entity256			0
as participation and donations to the @entity250 , @entity264 - based charity flag — whether due to economic troubles or anger over the 2012 @entity18 controversy or some other reason — @entity135 says news of @entity2 ’s salary will only make matters worse for @entity5			1
drop in numbers ? the breast cancer awareness foundation took major heat in 2012 after pulling funding from @entity18 , which some now blame for flagging participation in the group 's races ‘ when donors realize that her salary is so high and so out of comparison to what it normally would be , ’ he told @entity28 , ‘ i am certain there are going to be some donors who are no longer going to support this organization because they have lost trust in its decision - making			1
’ @entity286 , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 and has raised over $ 20,000 for @entity5 through her participation in races and other events , also believes @entity2 , and not poor participation , is the organization 's problem			1
' if @entity2 were smart , she ’d say , " @entity294 , i took $ 685,000 in salary last year			0
whatever we need to make these events go on , how about i give up my salary for a year , " ' @entity296 told the @entity55			0
' she is their biggest liability			0

ceo @entity2 's took a big pay raise from $ 417,000 in 2010 and continues to benefit from the bump in pay despite announcing in 2012 she planned to step down from the job
7 out of 14 3 - day races were cancelled in cities nationwide for 2014 due to drops in participation
some blame controversy over @entity5 's decision to defund breast exams at @entity18 in 2012 for lower turnout
between 2007 and 2009 , @entity2 billed the *non-profit* $ 133,507 in expenses while working full - time for the *federal* *government*
