by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 17 october 2012 new pictures of the surface of @entity3 taken by @entity5 's @entity4 show what looks like a giant hot cross bun rising out of the mysterious moon 's crust			1
steam from baking often causes the top of bread to lift and crack			2
scientists think some similar process involving heat may be at play on @entity19 's largest moon			1
hot cross bun : scientists observing data from @entity5 's @entity4 spacecraft discovered this image of bread - like cracks in the surface of @entity3 , which is the larges moon orbiting @entity19 deja vu : scientists have seen similar terrain on @entity31 , where a dome - shaped region about 20 miles ( 30 km ) across has been seen at the summit of a large volcano called @entity36 similar terrain has been pictured before on @entity31 , where a dome - shaped region about 20 miles ( 30km ) across has been seen at the summit of a large volcano called @entity36			1
researchers believe the @entity3 cross , which is about 40 miles ( 70km ) long , is also the result of fractures caused by uplift from below , possibly the result of rising magma			2
' the ' hot cross bun ' is a type of feature we have not seen before on @entity3 , showing that @entity3 keeps surprising us even after eight years of observations from @entity4 , ' said @entity52 , a @entity4 radar team scientist at @entity5 ’s @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			1
' the ' bun ' may be the result of what is known on @entity60 as a laccolith , an intrusion formed by magma pushing up from below			0
the @entity64 of @entity65 are well - known examples of this geologic phenomenon			0
' the image showing the bun - like mound was obtained on may 22 , 2012 , by @entity4 ’s radar instrument			2
another group of @entity4 scientists , led by @entity73 , who is based at @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , has been scrutinising radar images of @entity3 ’s southern hemisphere where they found the shorelines of ancient seas			1
@entity3 is the only place other than @entity60 known to have stable liquid on its surface , though the liquids on @entity3 are hydrocarbon rather than water			0
so far , vast seas have only been seen in @entity3 ’s northern hemisphere			2
but now , a new analysis of @entity4 images collected from 2008 to 2011 suggests there were once vast , shallow seas at @entity3 ’s south pole as well			1
this image from @entity5 's @entity4 spacecraft shows an ancient southern sea that used to sprawl out near the south pole of @entity19 's @entity3			1
the red outline traces the ancient shoreline			0
within this basin is the largest present - day lake in @entity3 's southern hemisphere , @entity103 @entity3 , pictured above in an image taken by the @entity4 spacecraft , is one of the most @entity60 - like bodies in the @entity108			1
with a thick atmosphere , a diameter between that of @entity60 and the planet @entity112 , and a network of seas , lakes and rivers , it is in many respects more like a planet than a moon like the @entity60 ’s			0
with surface temperatures at a chilly @entity124 , researchers believe @entity3 's environment is too cold for life as we know it , but its environment , rich in the building blocks of life , is of great interest to astrobiologists			1
the satellite 's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen ( like @entity60 ’s ) , and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide , which may have played a role in the emergence of life on @entity60			0
the liquid on its surface is not water , but super-cooled methane and ethane			0
last month scientists revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to @entity3 , which is @entity19 's largest moon dr @entity73 and her colleagues have found two good candidates for dry or mostly dry seas			1
one of these dry seas appears to be about 300 by 170 miles ( 475 by 280km ) across , and perhaps a few hundred feet deep			0
@entity103 , the largest current lake in the south , sits inside of the dry shorelines , like a shrunken version of a once - mighty sea			0
scientists led by @entity159 , another radar team member based at the @entity161 in @entity55 , think @entity3 is subject to cycles analogous to @entity60 ’s @entity164 cycles , which explain climate changes in terms of the way our planet orbits around the @entity170 such cycles on @entity3 would cause long - term transfer of liquid hydrocarbons from pole to pole			2
by this model , the south pole could have been covered with extensive seas less than 50,000 years ago			0
' the seas on @entity3 are temporary hosts for experiments in prebiotic chemistry , and we know they are cycling from one hemisphere to the other over 100,000 years , ' said dr @entity73			2
' i ’d love to get a closer look at the seas of the north or these dry seabeds to examine the extent to which this prebiotic chemistry has developed			0
' the @entity4 team has confirmed some of the stability of @entity3 ’s northern seas by looking at radar images from @entity4 taken about one @entity3 season ( in this case , six @entity60 years ) apart			1
the newer images , from may 22 , 2012 , on the same flyby as the hot cross bun images , show the shorelines stayed about the same , indicating the northern lakes are not transient weather events , in contrast to the temporary darkening of parts of the equator after a rainstorm in 2010 .			0

scientists believe cracks on @entity3 's surface are caused by a similar process to that which makes bread lift and crack
images were captured by radar instruments by @entity5 's @entity4 spacecraft
more images sent back by the probe show that the moon 's southern hemisphere was once covered by great seas
