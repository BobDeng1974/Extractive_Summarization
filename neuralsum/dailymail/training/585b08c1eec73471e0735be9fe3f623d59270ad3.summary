technology has already changed the way we communicate , but now it 's revolutionising the way we fall - and stay - in love			1
from gadgets that let you hold hands with distant loved ones to watches that share your heartbeat - the future of relationships is getting a lot more hi - tech. but despite being heralded as a new era in expressing our affections , some experts have warned that a reliance on apps , gadgets and robots will leave us emotionally stunted			1
‘ everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused			2
so there are dangers ... just as there are with cars , trains and ships , ’ said robotics expert professor @entity21			2
wrist to wrist @entity48 is on of the first major firms to push ' virtual connection '			1
its @entity51 , expected to launch in spring next year , includes a feature called ' @entity53 ' that lets wearers ' communicate without words			1
' @entity48 said it offers ' fun , spontaneous ways to connect with other @entity48 watch wearers , wrist to wrist			1
' researchers recently claimed people are so engrossed in their phones , they are unable to accurately read how people are feeling in real - life			1
this is the result of less face - to - face time interaction , according to a psychologist at the @entity72 's @entity71			1
it found children in particular are glued to electronic devices for nearly five hours each day , and this could be leaving them emotionally stunted			2
a separate study recently found that we spend more time on our smartphones than with our partner			1
the average smartphone user tends to spend two hours ( 119 minutes ) a day using their gadget , the study found			2
yet , the amount of time we spend with our other halves per day is just 97 minutes - a third less - on average			2
the study , from network operator @entity89 looked at exactly what we use our phones for and how much time each activity takes each day			0
this includes being able to sketch messages to a friend , send voice memos , and also the ability to send a heartbeat			1
it reads a user 's heart rate , using a built - in sensor , before sending it to a fellow wearer , who feels the heartbeat on their wrist			1
hold hands ... even if you 're 100 miles away elsewhere , people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of @entity116			1
when one user squeezes their @entity33 , the corresponding @entity118 in their loved one 's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand , simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other			1
when combined with @entity129 , for example , the experience is said to be ' immersive '			2
@entity130 is also changing the way gamers virtually interact with characters - or even fake girlfriends			0
lie on your virtual girlfriend 's lap earlier this year , @entity139 firm @entity138 unveiled a bizarre pillow , shaped like a pair of girl 's legs			1
when used with an @entity130 virtual reality headset , it lets men sit next to a virtual girlfriend , ' touch ' them and rest their head on her lap. each of the virtual partners are based on the @entity152 cartoon character , which is the mascot for an open - source cross-platform game engine called @entity152 designed by @entity154			1
this ' lap pillow ' mimics the shape of these character 's legs			2
when one user squeezes their @entity33 , the corresponding @entity118 in their loved one 's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand , simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other			1
when combined with @entity129 , for example , the experience is said to be ' immersive ' ( pictured ) although many companies have attempted to create gadgets that help virtually connect loved ones , @entity48 became one of the first major firms to feature it in an upcoming product			1
its @entity51 includes being able to sketch messages to a friend ( left ) , send voice memos but also the ability to send a heartbeat ( right ) ... @entity183 the same firm also released a virtual breast simulator			1
this consisted of a model with a fake pair of breasts fitted with pressure sensors , and which connects to an @entity130 headset			1
when the wearer squeezes the model 's breasts , a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest			1
cyber hugs all round elsewhere in @entity139 , a tech firm recently invented a chair that can hug people			1
research has scientifically proven that receiving and giving hugs releases the body 's natural ' love drug ' , oxytocin , calming the nervous system and boosting positive emotions			1

family meals have been decimated by technology , with children often spending their entire time tapping away on their phone - if they can be removed from their bedroom to come to the table at all			0
however , a free app claims to be able to solve the problem - by locking their gadgets at meal times			0
the free @entity270 app can show children how long they have , then lock their phone - and even show them how long is left until they can leave the table			0
adult streaming platform @entity274 , for example , recently announced it 's building an app for @entity130 that will ' put viewers into the action			1

and almost half ( 46 per cent ) thought technology was evolving too quickly and ‘ undermining traditional ways of life			0
’ ‘ everything that is useful has within it the potential to be abused			0
so there are dangers inherent in robots ; just as there are with cars , trains and ships , ’ said professor @entity21 who led the study			0

if we are unlucky they might treat us in the same way as we treat chickens , pigs and cows			0
