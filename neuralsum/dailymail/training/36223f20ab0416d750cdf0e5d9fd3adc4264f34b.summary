stormed : armed police raced to the home of @entity2 after he posted a new profile picture on @entity4 featuring an @entity5 , along with a toy mortar gun in the background there were five police officers at the door , two of them carrying submachine guns			1
and they were ready to smash the door open so it was fortunate @entity2 was in when they pulled up outside his home			1
they had come in search of a deadly mortar tube – spotted in the background of a picture that mr @entity2 had posted on @entity4			1
mr @entity2 , 43 , did indeed have a mortar in the home and promptly showed it to the squad			1
after inspecting the model mortar , the rather embarrassed team of officers apologised and took their leave			2
‘ i could n’t believe someone thought it was real , ’ said mr @entity2 , a model maker , at his home in @entity31 , @entity32			1
‘ it ’s tiny and quite clearly a toy			2
i ca n’t stop laughing			0
i think it ’s hilarious			0
’ the mortar , or at least part of it , was featured in a picture mr @entity2 took of an @entity43 figure and a toy @entity45 dog			1
he posted the picture on @entity4 ‘ as a laugh ’ because he says he looks rather like the @entity49 figure and owns an @entity45			1
the mortar was near to a tv remote control which showed how small it was			2
nevertheless , someone called in the police			0
he says that the officers did manage to ‘ see the funny side ’ even though their mission had ended in farce			0
cause of alarm ? the @entity4 profile picture of mr @entity2 showing an action man and his model mortar mr @entity2 said : ‘ i was stunned			1
five officers turned up in unmarked police cars			0
‘ they flashed the search warrant in my face and said it was lucky i was in so they did n’t have to break my door down			0
everyone has been laughing about it and i think it ’s funny			0
‘ the @entity5 looked a bit like me so i decided to put it as my @entity4 picture			1
‘ i did n’t even notice the mortar in the background			2
‘ over a month later , there were the cops , threatening to bust down my door			0
’ mr @entity2 posted the picture on december 7 and the police arrived at his home on january 28			1
mortars are portable , short - range weapons used to fire shells or bombs at a steep angle to drop them on to enemy lines			0
' i think it 's hilarious ' : mr @entity2 said he could n't believe someone thought the gun was real and reported it to the police @entity32 police spokesman @entity97 said : ‘ the information was given to us in good faith and we acted with good intentions			2
‘ we are sure that the community would rather we acted quickly on information given to us of this nature , in case it had turned out to be a weapon			0
‘ the officers attending were hugely relieved that it was n’t anything more sinister and we would much rather have a result like this than to put the public in harm ’s way by not taking action			0

in the background was a toy mortar gun , about six inches tall
