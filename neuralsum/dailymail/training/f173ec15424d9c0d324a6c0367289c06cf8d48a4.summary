by @entity1 reporter a woman who thought she was having a stroke had to get out of the ambulance and take the subway to a @entity7 hospital because the driver and paramedic were arguing so aggressively			2
' they were constantly bickering back and forth with one another , and to the point that i felt so uncomfortable , ' @entity10 said of the emergency response team she was matched with on saturday			2
ms @entity10 , a veteran , called 911 because she ' started having numbness on the left side of my face and this tingling '			1
frustrating : @entity10 called 911 because she thought she was having a stroke but because the paramedics were bickering , she did not feel safe in the ambulance and got out symptoms : she felt a tingling on her right side and thought she was having a stroke but it was later @entity30 , a disease that causes paralysis on one side she thought that she was having a stroke but it was later determined that she had @entity30 , a form a facial paralysis that requires immediate care			1
