the party stalwart also questioned the ' character ' of the new generation of @entity14			2
ramping up pressure on the @entity8 leader , he said mr @entity3 's attempts to appear strong by seeking a confrontation with the unions were ' not enough ' and he needed to put forward a ' coherent ' agenda			1
lord @entity2 said mr @entity3 had to set out a ' very clear idea ' and a ' vision ' about what he wanted to achieve as @entity8 leader			1
he is the latest senior party figure to criticise mr @entity3 over his low - key leadership style and lack of policies			1
former home secretary @entity28 this week likened @entity8 ’s policy process to a ‘ pregnant panda ’			2
in a typically forthright interview with @entity32 , @entity2 dismissed suggestions that @entity8 was holding back policies to prevent other parties stealing them , saying : ' sometimes i think that 's a cover because we might not have thought what the f * * * ing best alternative is , but anyway ... see the real problem now is there 's got to be coherence			1
' he said it was getting ' bloody close ' to the stage where mr @entity3 would have to set out the policies to back up his @entity48 agenda			1
lord @entity2 said : ' he 's called " weak , weak , weak " every day , every minister going on television , but as soon he gets into the scrap with the unions it becomes ' strong , strong , strong '			2
' but what about your policies ? what are you doing about that ? ' he compared the battle to that fought by @entity62 to reform the party , saying it resulted in ' the perception of the leader ... is he 's become strong '			1
' that is exactly what has happened to @entity3 at the moment , but it 's not enough , you really have to have a very clear idea , a vision of what you 're going to do			1
' that 's about campaigning , about drawing the differences , and not being buffeted about by the problems that come from a government who have chosen a different set of priorities			2
lord @entity2 is the latest senior party figure to criticise the @entity8 leader @entity3 , pictured ' it 's not only to say ' we vote against ' - you need to put that into a coherent policy			1
our campaigning has to remind people ... traditional values in a modern setting			0
you have to deliver change but connected to your principles and beliefs			0
' because the belief of the @entity98 is just money , money money , it always was			0
if we talk about whether we want to be different to the @entity98 you better find some framework in which we achieve it			0
' lord @entity2 , a former trade union official , compared his background to that of @entity8 's current mps who had been ' researchers , things like that '			1
he said : ' the party is moving on , it 's a different system , and it 's producing different people			2
there 's less to pick from			0
there 's not many of them coming out now			0
' most of them have been to university			0
well , fine , great , they 've got more brains but i 'm not sure about the character			0
' you 've got to have a message and a vision and a leader that feels they are taking that on and believe in it			0
in politics , character is still part of it			0
' another former deputy labour leader , @entity131 , told the magazine : ' we 're very much into the politics of personality , the politics of instant response , the politics of gimmick rather than principles			0
' the @entity8 needs to demonstrate what it stands for			2
when i was a young man , it was clear what it stood for : there was a large army of the poor , there were masses of houses that needed to be built , and there was n't a health service			0
' the @entity8 could say these things are so obvious that we do n't need to set out our ideology			1
now it 's more complicated			0
society has changed , and we need a firm ideological question because people do n't know what we stand for			0
' the most damning question asked of @entity162 during his premiership was [ @entity165 ] @entity164 saying to him : " well , what is the @entity8 for ? " @entity3 can answer that question , and must go on answering it very loudly and very clearly			1
' he praised mr @entity169 for making the party ' more socialist than it was three years ago ' , saying ' the @entity8 is moving in the right direction ' .			1

the peer is the latest senior party figure to criticise mr @entity3 over his lack of policies
the former union official said @entity8 's current mps had been ' researchers , things like that '
