i remember it being 20p short , it might have been more or a bit less than that			1
' i remember having a conversation with the bus driver			2
i said i was ‘ short ’ and i said could i get on anyway and he said ' no. ' the victim said her last memory of the night was walking towards home alone			2
she could recall nothing about the attack and her next memory was waking up in hospital about 8.30am the same day			0
attack : the woman was allegedly set upon and raped at @entity25 's @entity70 @entity71 , prosecuting , told the court the woman ' was effectively turfed off the bus and left stranded in @entity25 at 3am in the morning			1
' she then called her mother who agreed to pick her up in the family car			2
the victim volunteered to walk a short distance to the edge of the city centre so her mother would not have to negotiate a one - way system she was unfamiliar with and to avoid driving on streets busy with late - night revellers			1
@entity86 heard the victim was grabbed by the neck and dragged in to @entity25 ’s @entity70 where she was beaten and raped			1

mr @entity71 described the attack as ' savage and almost devoid of any mercy			0
' mr @entity71 told the jury that ' in the cruelest of circumstances ' the mother had pulled up on a stretch of the road where she expected her daughter to be walking , and just yards from where she had been attacked			2
tragic : a night bus drives through @entity25			0
the victim tried to get on board a similar one but was refused because she was 20p short the mother called her daughter ’s mobile phone twice and on each occasion she could hear a male voice making ' grunting ' sounds before the line went dead			1
police in a passing patrol car stopped to ask the mother if was all okay and she explained that she was looking for her daughter , who , unbeknown to her and the officers , lay injured nearby			0
moments later the defendant ran to the police car and banged on the roof			0
the court heard he told the officers he had been walking through the park and had come across the victim who had already been attacked			2

i think a girl has been raped or something			0
' he claimed to the officers that mud and the woman ’s blood were transferred to his body and clothes when he tried to help her to her feet			0
the girl was found nearby sat with her knees pulled tight to her chin and she was naked from the waist down			0
when told he was being arrested on suspicion of attacking the woman , the defendant replied : ' this is what you get for trying to help someone			2
' tests showed the defendant was around two - and - a - half times over the legal drink - drive limit			1
