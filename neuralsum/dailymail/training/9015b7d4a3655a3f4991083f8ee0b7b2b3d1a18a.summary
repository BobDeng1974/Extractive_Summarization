when @entity10 and @entity11 lost their home and restaurant business in 2008 they vowed never to use credit again - even when building their new house			1

downsize : the @entity30 share this 168sq ft home with their two children new beginnings : @entity11 and @entity10 with their children @entity27 and @entity28 cosy : the family have made the most of the inside space and enjoy curling up on the sofa with a good book with a galley kitchen , lounge - diner , bathroom and two loft bedrooms , the family have managed to squeeze their new lives into a tiny space			1
' we decided to go this small because , after going through such financial stress , we decided to never use credit again , ' mrs @entity50 told the @entity55			2
' [ we ] built a home that we could afford to build to completion so that we could live comfortably in our space while we continued to build the rest of our homestead			1
' it cost the couple $ 12,000 to make their tiny house , which was built on a flatbed trailer using materials found on @entity66 and from other sources			2
the three - acre plot of land it is built on cost the couple $ 25,000 , according to @entity72			2
and most of the construction was done by mr @entity11			1
' @entity11 learned his building skills from his father and his eight years working in construction during the building boom in @entity4 , ' mrs @entity50 said			1
' it â€™s genetic ; he comes from a long line of @entity82 handy - folk			0

they have ducks and chickens and a large vegetable plot so they can grow as much of their own food as possible			0
while the small house has given them peace of mind and a mortgage - free existence , the couple admit that with two children aged eight and ten , sometimes the space can feel a bit tight			0
room has to be found for bookbags , guitars , yoga mats and , in winter , extra coats and boots			0
' we still have the stuff of everyday life , but there 's a lot of shuffling about , ' mrs @entity131 , who writes the @entity133 blog			0
but when asked if they felt anything was missing , all mr @entity11 could think of was a tub - the family have only a shower in their bathroom			1
by sacrificing space , the family have managed to make big savings and are well on their way to building a more regular - sized 1,400sq ft house on their plot of land			0
the construction of the new home , and details about life in their tiny house , is chronicled on the family 's @entity156 page			0
