the @entity0 has been accused of using a tax breaks scheme to increase its public funding			1
yesterday it emerged the corporation has set up artificial companies to attract tax credits , prompting claims that it is behaving in a similar manner to huge private firms such as @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the broadcaster has already saved more than £ 500,000 according to reports , with a share of up to £ 265million over five years available			0
the @entity0 has been accused of behaving like tax dodgers ' @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 ' by using a multimillion - pound tax break scheme to increase its income it has taken advantage of a decision by @entity23 in 2012 to allow cuts in corporation tax to high - cost @entity27 - made dramas , comedies and animation , in an attempt to increase filmmaking in the @entity27			1
independently - produced programmes , or those made by @entity35 , which is the @entity0 ’s commercial arm , would be eligible for the cuts , the chancellor indicated			2
but @entity0 shows produced in - house for public - service channels could not be claimed for , because the @entity0 is non-profit making and therefore does not pay corporation tax			1
the @entity0 then created a commercial subsidiary for drama – @entity44 – and a subsidiary for comedy – @entity0 @entity47			0
it is through @entity49 that £ 520,133 has been reclaimed as nominal corporation tax for two dramas : the interceptor and one child			1
the @entity0 could receive more , as there is a total budget of £ 205million for tax relief to drama , and a further £ 60million for animations			1
@entity60 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , criticised the move			1
she told the @entity63 : ‘ it is wrong for the @entity0 to deliberately set up an artificial structure to get taxpayers ’ money as it is for @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 and they should stop it			1
' i believe in the publicly funded service but they have got to behave properly			0
' the @entity0 said the government is aware of this approach and has voiced no objections			0
but @entity60 's attack is likely to embarrass @entity75 , the director - general , who has attempted to clampdown on the internal @entity0 gravy train			1
the @entity0 does not pay corporation tax , as it is non-profit - making			1
@entity23 announced in his 2012 budget that the cuts in corporation tax would apply to high - cost dramas , comedies and animations made in @entity27			1
the creative industry tax reliefs work by increasing the amount of allowable expenditure , so when the company makes a loss , it is able to ' surrender ' the loss			0
from april to december last year the high - end tv tax relief supported more than £ 233 million of investment in high - end @entity27 - produced television			2
@entity23 said programmes aired on the @entity0 's networks could be eligible if they were made by independent producers or the corporation 's commercial arm , @entity35			2
but the @entity0 could not claim the money for shows produced in - house for public - service channels , because this would breach @entity106 rules on state aid			2
the @entity109 's letter to @entity110 said the scheme giving tax relief to drama had a total budget of £ 205million for the five - year period to april 2018 , while a further £ 60million was available for animations			2
the @entity0 said : ' the @entity0 is committed to investing as much money as possible into the shows audiences love and by applying for tax credits , we can invest even more money into our programmes			0
' this in turn delivers wider economic and cultural benefits by ensuring productions are shot in the @entity27 rather than abroad			0
it also allows the @entity0 to compete on an equal footing with independent productions , including those commissioned by the @entity0 , that use the tax credit			0
' the @entity27 tax credits are available to all productions which satisfy the clear , objective criteria set out in the relevant legislation			0
having taken the appropriate legal , tax and regulatory advice , the @entity0 considers that it is best able to deliver the benefits associated with the @entity27 tax credit via commercial subsidiaries			0
the government is aware of this approach and has voiced no objection			0
' @entity23 offered tax breaks to attract high end tv productions , dubbed the @entity146 , to build on the global success of the @entity149 period drama			2
from april to december last year the high - end tv tax relief supported more than £ 233 million of investment in high - end @entity27 - produced tv between april and december 2013			2
@entity23 said @entity0 's networks could be eligible if they were made by independent producers or the corporation 's commercial arm			0
so the @entity0 set up @entity156 to secure a rebate of up to 20 per cent on high - profile shows			1
it works by increasing the amount of allowable expenditure , so when the company makes a loss , it is able to ' surrender ' the loss .			0
