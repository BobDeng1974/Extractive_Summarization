@entity0 limped off after 15 minutes of saturday 's 25 - 18 @entity6 victory over @entity7 and will now miss the @entity8 against @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
' i 'd be very surprised if @entity0 plays any part in the autumn			1
he 'll clearly be missing for a few weeks as a minimum , ' @entity16 director of rugby @entity17 said			1
@entity2 centre @entity0 has been ruled out of next month 's autumn series because of a groin injury @entity0 limped off after 15 minutes of saturday 's 25 - 18 @entity6 victory over @entity7 @entity0 was outstanding against the @entity9 during @entity2 's three - test tour in @entity9 last summer a time frame for @entity0 's return is expected in the coming days with the @entity25 and @entity26 having suffered a different groin injury to the one that sidelined him for three @entity32 games last month			1
@entity17 stresses that @entity0 's rehabilitation will not be rushed to enable him to make the end of @entity2 's @entity35 , which begins against the @entity9 on november 8			1
' @entity0 's had scans and we 're still waiting for the exact prognosis			2
he wo n't be fit for the autumn internationals for sure , ' @entity17 said			2
@entity2 coach @entity40 ( left ) will have to plan for november without his hard - running centre @entity0 ' you 'd imagine it being four weeks plus before he 's back on the field			1
he 'll struggle to be involved			0
' we had the @entity2 doctor in and everybody 's aware of the situation			2
it 's a continual dialogue			0
' we know how good @entity0 is , he does n't need to prove himself , he just needs to get himself fit			2
that 's the key for me			0
if he 's right and fit then he 's as good as there is			0
@entity2 v @entity9 , november 8th @entity2 v @entity10 , november 15th @entity2 v @entity11 , november 22nd @entity2 v @entity12 , november 29th ' it 's not about him playing at the back end of the autumn , it 's about him being fit and making sure he 's 100 % so he can come back and do what @entity0 does			1
' @entity0 first damaged his groin in the 24 - 20 @entity32 victory at @entity64 on september 13			1
' it 's a slightly different injury			0
he went to push off and accelerate and he thought he was going to score , ' @entity17 said			0
' he backed himself , felt his groin go and there was no power			0
for @entity0 to come off immediately is unusual - he was in a fair bit of pain			2
@entity72 centre @entity70 is set for a call - up to replace @entity0 in @entity75 's @entity2 squad ' at this point we just need to find out exactly what the problem is and find the right treatment			1
' before his groin was very tight so we rested it , rehabilitated it and he was feeling good			0
he trained properly and there were no issues			0
' but clearly there was something there that there should n't have been and he 's done something else now			0
' the news is a major setback for @entity2 , who have been robbed of their main strike weapon for the entirety of a key part of their 2015 @entity97 preparations			2
if fit , @entity0 was a guaranteed starter against @entity9 and his absence leaves a gaping hole in the midfield			1
' @entity0 did his pectoral muscle last year , but these things happen , ' @entity17 said			2
' he 's a powerful man and a powerful athlete who is still developing and growing to a certain degree			0
' of course he 's frustrated but he 's pretty level headed and is a good pro. his concern is to get fit			0
' @entity108 is a huge thing at the end of next year and he wants to be a part of that			0
' @entity2 head coach @entity40 names his 33 - man elite player squad for the autumn on wednesday lunchtime .			1
