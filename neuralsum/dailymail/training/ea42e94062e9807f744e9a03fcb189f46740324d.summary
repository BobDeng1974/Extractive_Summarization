scientists have managed to peer into the brains of mice so clearly that they watch as memories are formed			2
they saw how certain proteins changed and clustered on nerve cells , as memories were forged after tickling the creatures ’ whiskers			1
the technique could shed light on how we learn as well as what goes wrong in disorders like autism , alzheimer ’s disease and schizophrenia			0
this is a single nerve cell in the cortex of a live mouse			0
individual branches are shown in different colours and the bumps on the branches are where synapses form ‘ as far as we know , no one has ever been able to look at receptor proteins in live animals before , ’ said professor @entity28 , director of the @entity29 at the @entity30			2
‘ this allows us to get a more accurate picture of what ’s really happening as the brain processes experiences into memories			0
’ researchers at the university in @entity43 , @entity44 , studied ampa receptors , which are proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals in the form of the molecule glutamate			1
glutamate is the major mediator of electrical signals in the central nervous systems of mammals and is involved in most aspects of normal brain function including cognition , memory and learning			0
the receptors themselves play a role in strengthening synapses , which are the connections between nerve cells that form memories			1
up until now , scientists were limited to studying @entity69 receptors in nerve cells in tissue samples , or grown in the laboratory , but neither of those methods could preserve the complex circuitry , hormones and neurochemicals of a living brain			1
researchers studied @entity69 receptors - proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals and play a role in strengthening synapses , which firm @entity85 image shows the formation of synapses on a nerve shaft in a mouse 's brain after different periods of time , after its whiskers were stimulated to solve that problem , professor @entity28 ’s team , led by dr @entity97 , engineered mice whose ampa receptors glowed under the light of a special microscope			1
the type of microscope they used is capable of focusing at a depth of half a millimetre , meaning it can peer into the brain ’s outer layer - the cortex			2
thousands of nerve cells carry information to the cortex from every part of the body and each of a mouse ’s whiskers has a group of dedicated nerve cells called barrel fields			1
the team took images of animals ’ brains immediately before and after researchers tickled a single whisker on each mouse for an hour , according to the study , published in the journal @entity132			0
they were surprised to find that tickling increased the number of @entity69 receptors on nerve cells and strengthened the synapses of the barrel fields of the tickled whiskers , forming memories			1

the reserachers took images of animals ’ brains immediately before and after researchers tickled a single whisker on each mouse , for an hour after monitoring the mice over a few days , they discovered that the @entity69 receptor levels remained high , suggesting that the whisker - tickling experience had a long - term effect on the mice ’s memories			1
dr @entity97 explained : ‘ the mysteries are the purpose that is served by strengthening these synapses , and whether more @entity69 receptors are being made or if they are moving in from somewhere else			2
‘ future studies will address those questions			0
’ professor @entity28 explained : ‘ this technique opens up many more possibilities , like visualising learning at the molecular level as it is happening in the intact brain in healthy mice and in mouse models of brain disorders			0
’ the researchers plan on using the new technique to see what happens as mice learn a complex task			0
they hope to peer deeper into the brain to areas like the hippocampus , which has a crucial role in memory formation and has been implicated in neurological disorders like autism , alzheimer ’s disease and schizophrenia , once optics technology improves			0

these images of the formation of memories were taken in a live mouse 's brain			0

scientists from @entity30 in @entity43 created mice with brain receptors that glowed under the light of a special microscope
receptors help nerve cells strengthen their connections to form memories
they were able to see nerve cells clearly , to observe how memories form
this has been *previously* *impossible* , until the new imaging technique
images show that tickling the whiskers of mice increased the number of @entity69 receptors on their nerve cells - forming memories
