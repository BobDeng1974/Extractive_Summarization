by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 07:32 est , 10 may 2013 billions of noisy red - eyed cicadas have started to surface in @entity2 after 17 years underground			1
the infestation , named @entity4 by scientists , has not been seen since 1996			0
before that it last appeared in 1979			0
they do not bite or sting , and will not crops or other animals			0
lots of people will not even see them , though they could certainly hear their mating call , which was once recorded at 94 decibels			1
and the insects can even be transformed into a high protein , low - carb meal			1
click here to open a live interactive map of the invasion the cicadas have been living underground for 17 years and will emerge when the ground temperature hits @entity24 the cicadas , seen here in @entity2 , shed their shells and spread their wings before finding a mate the recipe book by @entity31 , below , can be found here			1
the recipes include : @entity34 dumplings @entity36 tacos cica - delicious pizza sizzling chili cicadas @entity40 cicada tartlets banana cicada bread chocolate chip trillers cicada - rhubarb piece and , ms @entity31 's favourite , chocolate covered cicadas the magicicadas are only after sex			1
after a few weeks up singing their loud mating call up in the trees , they will die and their offspring will go underground , not to return until 2030			1
since 1996 , this group of one - inch bugs , has been a few feet underground , sucking on tree roots and biding their time			1
they will emerge only when the ground temperature reaches precisely 64f			1
' this particular brood is extremely large ' , pest controller @entity60 told @entity63 , who saw a swarm at a farm in @entity67			0
' i 've never seen so many in one location in my life			0
they were on almost every blade of grass			0
' sightings have been reported within @entity2 and as far away as @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity77			0
a live online tracker by @entity79 is encouraging residents to report ground temperatures and sightings to be passed on to scientists at the @entity84			0
and most customers appear to have taken mr @entity60 's advice to avoid pesticides and ' let @entity88 take its course '			0
a recipe book by scientist @entity31 advocates collecting the creatures for food - though not without consulting a doctor first , and not if you suffer from a nut or shellfish allergy			2
she told @entity97 that about 8pm to 9pm is the prime time for cicada gathering			0
' you 're going to look at the low - lying shrubs on the ground , ' she said			2
' you 're probably going to need a lot because they 're great			0
' ms @entity105 , who wrote the book during her phd at the @entity108 and now works for the @entity110 department of agriculture , advised grabbing the magicicadas off bushes and putting them into a paper bag or basket			1
' newly hatched cicadas , called tenerals , are considered best for eating because their shells have not hardened , ' says the book			1
' they should be blanched ( for 4 - 5 minutes ) soon after collection and before you eat them ! ' not only will this make their insides solidify a bit , but it will get rid of any soil bacteria that is living on or in them			2
you can then cook with them immediately , or freeze them			0
' the insects are expected to arrive in such numbers that people from @entity2 to @entity136 will be outnumbered roughly 600 - to - 1			1
this year 's group of nagicicadas is known as @entity4 and has begun to emerge on the @entity139 of the @entity110 the insects do not sting or bite and pose no threat to humans or crops ' it 's just an amazing accomplishment , ' @entity143 , a @entity144 entomologist , told the @entity147			1
' how can anyone not be impressed ? ' there are ordinary cicadas that come out every year around the world , but these are different			1
they are called magicicadas - as in magic - and are red - eyed			1
and they are seen only in the eastern half of the @entity110			1
there are 15 @entity110 broods that emerge every 13 or 17 years			1
last year the swarm affected only a small area , mostly around the @entity162 of @entity163 , @entity163 and @entity164			2
next year , it is the turn of @entity166 into @entity167 and @entity168 ; and @entity169 and @entity170			2
@entity4 is one of the bigger groups			0
several experts say that they do n't know how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30billion seems like a sensible estimate			2
at the @entity178 , researcher @entity177 said it could be closer to a trillion			0
if 30billion magicicadas were lined up head to tail , they would reach the moon and back			2
' there will be some places where it 's wall - to - wall cicadas , ' says @entity108 entomologist @entity188			1
strength in numbers is the key to cicada survival : there are so many of them that the birds ca n't possibly eat them all , and those that are left over are free to multiply , he says			0
some scientists think the magicicadas come out in the odd 13 and 17 - year cycles so that predators can not match the timing and be waiting for them in huge numbers			1
another theory is that the unusual cycles ensure that different broods do n't compete with each other			2
and there 's the mystery of just how these bugs know it has been 17 years and is time to come out , instead of 15 or 16 years			1
' these guys have evolved several mathematically clever tricks , ' @entity188 says			0
' these guys are geniuses with little tiny brains			0
' while they stay underground , the bugs are n't asleep			2
as some of the world 's longest - lived insects , they go through different growth stages and molt four times before ever getting to the surface			1
they feed on a tree fluid called xylem			0
then they surface , where they molt , leaving behind a crusty brown shell , and grow a half - inch bigger			1
as six - year - old @entity234 shows , the cicadas are harmless @entity234 has already encountered her first magicicada - and scientists say there could be between 30billion and a trillion of the insects waiting to surface the timing of when they first come out depends purely on ground temperature			1
that means early may for southern areas and late may or even june for northern areas			2
the males come out first as nymphs , which are essentially wingless and silent juveniles , then climb on to tree branches and molt one last time , becoming adult winged cicadas			2
they perch on tree branches and sing , individually or in a chorus			0
then when a female comes close , the males change their song , they do a dance and mate , @entity188 explained			0
the males keep mating and eventually the female lays 600 or so eggs on the tip of a branch			2
the offspring then dive - bomb out of the trees , bounce off the ground and eventually burrow into the earth , he says			0
' it 's a treacherous , precarious life , ' @entity188 says			0
' but somehow they make it work			0

magicicadas have begun to surface across the @entity139 of the @entity110
the insects appear in 13 or 17 year cycles and affect different areas
the red - eyed bugs are different from the cicadas that are seen every year
when they emerge , they shed their shells and spend three weeks mating
