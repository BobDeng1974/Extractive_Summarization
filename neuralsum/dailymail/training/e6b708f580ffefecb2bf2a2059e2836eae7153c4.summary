' weather conditions are significantly associated with ratings , ' the authors write			2
' reviews written on warm or cool days are more likely to be rated high than those written in cold or hot days			1
reviews written on rainy or snowy days tend to have lower ratings than those written on days without rain or snow			1

' science has shown that weather impacts our mood , so a nice day can lead to a nice review			0
a rainy day can mean a miserable one			2
