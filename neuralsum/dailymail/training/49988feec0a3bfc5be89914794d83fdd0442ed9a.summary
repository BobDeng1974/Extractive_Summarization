by @entity0 this creative teacher has taken recycling to a whole new level by creating scale replicas of cars from old beer and coke cans			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity9 , @entity10 , has been creating vehicles from aluminium cans for eight years			1
the colourful branding on the well - known cans forms the paintwork of hot rods , roadsters and other classic cars and even the steering wheels and headlights are painstakingly recreated			1
detail : some of the cars , like this buggy , took 30 cans to create although it looks as though it used less cola : the bright yellow branding of this can forms a brilliant paintwork for the model hot rod : the raised engine was another detail that brought this classic car to life beer can : the flimsy aluminium is painstakingly bent into shape to create the bodywork of the car mr @entity8 , who moved to @entity10 from @entity41 , originally trained as a draughtsman before retraining as a technology teacher			1
after he emigrated , he became interested in creating scale models of aircraft , classic cars and bikes from kits			2
a keen bass player , it was when he got to 40 years old while he was designing and building string instruments , that he had an accident and shattered his left wrist			2
his dreams of becoming a full - time instrument repairman were halted but it was while he was recovering he came up with idea			0
grille : the corrugated grille on this model is created perfectly from tiny strips of the lager can can cars : @entity8 has created these mini masterpieces from what some people would throw away labour of love : mr @entity8 has been creating these cars since he had an accident eight years ago even the ring pull is used on this car as mr @entity8 said he got the idea while recovering from an accident scale : the model even has a tiny steering wheel and miniature dashboard dials he stopped throwing away the recyclable cans and started experimenting			1
he 'd seen model aircraft built from cans before , but only using the plain interior aluminum			0
so he expanded upon the idea and built his first car in 2006 , the @entity84 , made from 8 @entity88 cans			0
he 's since built a number of incredible ' can cars ' , each individually designed with care and amazing attention to detail			0
mr @entity8 moved to @entity10 from @entity41 and originally trained as a draughtsman branding : the writing on the outside of a @entity97 can is still visible in the interior of the model car first car : mr @entity8 built his first car in 2006 , the @entity84 , made from 8 @entity88 cans @entity101 : this buggy has a speedo and a set of pedals as well as a tiny handbrake all made from the can vehicles include classics such as the @entity110 and are made from such classically designed cans as @entity101 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity97 , among others			1
each vehicle can take up to 30 cans , like the @entity117 , to manufacture			1
the @entity119 are available for purchase or , for the adventurous , plans are available to build your own version of @entity8 's @entity119			2
writing on his website , mr @entity8 said : ' i have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can and looking at the shape of the bottom thinking " that could make a really cool wheel "			1
' i decided to put pencil to paper and try and make a racing car using the bottoms of cans as its wheels , and the graphics as the decoration for the body			2
windows : this hot rod even has the standard red brake lights and circular windows in the back mr @entity8 had model aircraft built from cans before , but only using the plain interior aluminum classics : vehicles include such classics as the @entity110 and are made from several cans he 's since built a number of incredible ' @entity156 ' , each designed with care and attention to detail ' during the design stage , but more importantly during the construction , great care must be taken to ensure that the graphics on the can match up from one panel to the next			1
for what may appear to be just one can moving across a bonnet and down around a mudguard there could actually be five or six cans used to create that effect			0
' some of the cars have required over 30 cans for their construction			1
' due to the cans being as thin as a piece of paper , a wooden inner structure had to be made to support the flimsy shell before carefully cutting and creasing the panels to shape			0
' other materials used include superglue , galvanised wire , electrical cable , tiny nuts and bolts , and washers , aluminium tubing and a few pins from a sewing kit			0
@entity8 started designing the cars when he shattered his wrist in an accident and could n't work mr @entity8 said : ' i have always religiously recycled but often spent time looking at the graphics on the can ' although these are not models of real cars , the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale ' the small details that can be included really do add enormously to the effect			2
' although these are not models of real cars , the size of them would put them at about 1:10 scale			0
they do not have any working features , just nice to look at			0
