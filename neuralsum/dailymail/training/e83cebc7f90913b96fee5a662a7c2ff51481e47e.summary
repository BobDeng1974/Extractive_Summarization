the sun - kissed break at @entity36 , a luxury holiday chateau in @entity38 which is owned by @entity39 , the @entity40 ’s nephew , was followed by a tour of @entity42			0
but royal sources do not believe that the future @entity44 or @entity40 was conceived in the searing heat of the @entity46 , during the tour to celebrate the @entity48			1
this is because @entity2 was said to have been taking anti-malarial tablets while on the tour , which is not advised during pregnancy , and so it is unlikely that she was trying to conceive there			1

many predicted that would come after the tour was over			0
they were pictured in @entity17 clinking their glasses topped with water at a @entity101 @entity100			0
their decision to have a dry night and forgo the champagne fueled speculation that the @entity2 may be pregnant and has since been the subject of global fascination			2

night off : the @entity176 couple spent a night out together in october after spending time apart night out : the royal couple were taken out of the club 's back door and rushed to their car home following the trip , the couple have spent more time apart , with @entity2 attending solo engagements and @entity58 back at work as an @entity188 helicopter pilot			1
