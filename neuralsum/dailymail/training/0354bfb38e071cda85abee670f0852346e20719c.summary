changing tyre : nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full - size spare wheel as standard , according to research undertaken by a car website the reluctance of car - makers to provide traditional spare tyres has led to a huge rise in puncture call - outs in just four years , research reveals today			1
nine out of ten new vehicles are now sold without a full - size spare wheel as standard , according to car website @entity14			1
around a quarter ( 27 per cent ) are fitted with the ‘ space - saver ’ tyre , which can not be used for long distances , and less than half ( 46 per cent ) come with a repair kit – usually comprising an air - pump and a self - sealant			1
other alternatives include cars fitted with ‘ run - flats ’ , tyres that are reinforced to allow the motorist to continue driving on a puncture for a limited time			2
the trend has led to a huge rise in the number of wheel - related call - outs to breakdown organisations			0
the @entity33 alone says it has seen the number of motorists calling for roadside recovery due to tyre - related breakdowns rocket from 293,000 in 2010 to 357,000 in 2013 – an increase of nearly a quarter			1
the rise in calls from drivers without a traditional spare tyre is even more dramatic – up from 29,000 in 2010 to nearly 94,000 in 2013			1
remarkably , the @entity33 predicts it will handle more than quarter of a million such calls next year – a near nine-fold increase on 2010			0
the @entity33 has developed its own ‘ universal spare wheel ‘ which – which fits eight out of ten cars - and has been used more than 30,000 times since launch in january			2
a smaller version is being tested for cars like @entity53 and @entity54			0
the @entity56 report says that among the worst manufacturers for lack of a traditional spare tyre or ‘ space - saver ’ are @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , which do n’t provide one			1
among the best are @entity70 ’s @entity69 , @entity71 car - maker @entity72 and @entity74 ’s @entity73 which do			0
it notes : ‘ the phasing out of the spare wheel by car manufacturers has resulted in a surge of tyre and puncture related problems , with almost one in three of @entity14 readers reporting a tyre - related breakdown in the past two years			2
‘ with puncture and other tyre - related breakdowns on the rise , these cutbacks can come at a huge cost to the consumer , with some having to pay more than £ 600 to buy a full - size spare , in addition to the necessary jacking kit and brace			1
’ the report notes that the smaller ‘ space - saver ’ tyres were the most likely spare wheel fitted as ‘ standard ’ and were provided in just over a quarter ( 27per cent ) of all cars in the research			1
but the report notes : ‘ however , the space - saver is not designed to be driven for long distances , with most having a maximum recommended speed of around 50 mph , restricting drivers to short distances			2
’ a @entity109 's spare : around a quarter of vehicles are fitted with the ‘ space - saver ’ tyre , unsuitable for long distances ; less than half ( 46 per cent ) come with a repair kit – usually an air - pump and a self - sealant the demise of the spare tyre is being accelerated by @entity118 pressure on car - makers to cut pollution and @entity122 emissions from vehicles while improving fuel efficiency , say experts			1
@entity126 , managing editor of @entity14 explained that the @entity118 test - cycle for determining a car ’s co2 emissions uses a car ’s weight to calibrate the rolling road for the test			2
the heavier a car , the more fuel it uses and the more co2 emissions it generally produces			0
governments – including the @entity139 – tax a car according to how much co2 emissions a car produces according to a ‘ polluter pays ’ principle			0
so lighter cars usually qualify for lower tax			1
mr @entity126 said : ‘ for many car manufacturers , the spare wheel is seen as an easy route to cut weight			0
a typical 17 - inch alloy wheel weighs about 20kg , which can add up to nine grams of co2 to the vehicle ’s emissions			0
' in the short run , the owner benefits from lower vehicle tax , but in the long run they could be punished by a costly call out at the roadside			0
’ @entity33 technical director @entity162 said : ‘ the motor industry is under pressure to meet @entity166 and @entity139 greenhouse gas emissions targets and reducing the weight from cars by scrapping the spare wheel helps to make vehicles more fuel efficient			1
‘ so car manufacturers are increasingly supplying emergency puncture repair kits consisting of a tyre sealant and inflator pack instead of a spare wheel			2
’ but many drivers find emergency tyre repair kits ‘ awkward and messy to use ’ , he said			1
and often they ca n’t drive the car away afterwards as sealant kits only work with small holes			0
mr @entity162 added : ‘ many people do n’t realise they do n’t have a spare this until it ’ s too late			0
they often say i ’ve just spent £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 on a new car and i do n’t get a spare			0

around a quarter of new vehicles sold come with only a ' space saver ' tyre
just less than half are *shipped* to *customers* with a tyre repair kit
demise of spare tyre helped by @entity118 rules on fuel efficiency
lighter cars are more fuel efficient and a full - size spare can weigh 20kg
