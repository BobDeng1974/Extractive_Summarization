by @entity0 and @entity1 the former @entity3 pilot who stumbled on the @entity5 gun massacre described yesterday the carnage that confronted him			1
@entity7 , 53 , said he initially thought there had been a terrible car accident but then saw a ' lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them '			1
he compared what he saw to a scene from the tv crime series @entity17 : @entity19			0
first on the scene : @entity7 described finding the murdered @entity22 family as ' like something out of a @entity25 movie ' hero : mr @entity7 is seen here training in @entity27			1
he is a keen competitor in the triathlon mr @entity7 was cycling up a remote mountain road near @entity30 when he came across the bloodbath in a secluded car park			1
he was the first witness to arrive at the picturesque spot where @entity36 engineer @entity34 , 50 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , his dentist wife @entity39 , 47 , and her mother @entity40 , 74 , were each shot twice in the head			1
speaking publicly about the murders for the first time , mr @entity7 revealed how he found the @entity45 ' daughter @entity44 , seven , stumbling around			1
from a distance it looked as if she was ' larking about like a child would '			0
but as he approached he realised she was bleeding and moaning			1
@entity44 had been shot in the shoulder and badly beaten around the head			2
nearby was the family @entity53 containing the bodies of her parents and grandmother			2
next to it lay the body of @entity60 , 45 , a @entity5 cyclist who police believe may have been killed because he was in the ' wrong place at the wrong time ' and witnessed the attack			1
the @entity53 's wheels were still spinning and its engine was revving			1
inside , mr @entity7 saw the three bodies			1
video : @entity7 tells how he discovered the scene of the @entity5 massacre the @entity5 prosecutor leading the murder hunt said yesterday that the motive lies in @entity36			1
@entity74 was speaking in @entity75 after travelling to @entity38 to meet @entity36 police officers working on the case			2
he said it was ‘ without any doubt that the reasons and causes have their origins in this country ’			0
the comments add weight to the theory that the family , from @entity37 , were killed because of a dispute in @entity36			2
the @entity90 - led investigation is focusing on mr @entity22 ’s work , his relationship with his relatives and links to his native @entity95			2
yesterday officers continued to search the family ’s home			0
mr @entity7 , whose full name is @entity100 , told the @entity101 how when he first arrived he smelled ' burning rubber and that sort of hot burning engine smell '			1
he said : ' it seemed like a good idea to turn the car engine off , so i went around to the driver 's side and i needed to break the window to get in			2
' but the window was already “ star crazed ” anyway and i noticed some holes and i was starting to think “ is that a bullet hole ? ” as i was breaking the window			0
i had my cycle gloves on so i literally pushed the window , as it was already crazed , and turned the ignition off			0
' things were a lot calmer then because the engine was n't revving , the wheels were n't spinning and i started taking stock of the people who were inside			1
it became fairly evident that the injuries of the people inside did n't match what one would think people would be like from a car accident in a car park			2
secluded : police and forensic officers check the @entity53 at the murder scene in a secluded car park near @entity30 in the @entity5 , left , while a close - up , right , shows the windows shot out tragic : mr @entity7 was first on the scene to discover the bodies of engineer @entity34 , ( pictured ) 50 , his dentist wife @entity140 , 47 , and her mother ' then i moved around to the other side and looked into the rear			1
i have never seen people who have been shot before for real , apart from @entity25 stuff , but it seemed to me to be just like a @entity25 scene			0
' and if someone had said “ cut ” and everyone had just got up and walked away , that would have been it			0
but unfortunately it was real life			2
so it became quite obvious now , taking stock , that it was a gun crime			0
' asked about the condition of the people inside the car , he said : ' well if you have seen csi : @entity19 it was pretty much how you would imagine a set from csi : @entity19 would be like			0
there was a lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them			0
' mr @entity7 is regarded by @entity5 police as a potentially vital witness – someone whose identity they had been keen to protect			1
but yesterday , in an unexpected move , the aviation consultant and former @entity177 training captain agreed to give a tv interview about the horrific events on wednesday of last week			0
remarkably , he delivered his chilling testimony in a very matter of fact way			0
continuing his account , he said : ' now i was getting a little anxious , because i thought maybe there is some crazy person in the woods			0
i pulled out my mobile phone and tried to call the rescue services and of all the moments in the world to have no signal on your mobile phone , that was it			0
' mr @entity7 gently put @entity44 ' in a recovery position ' and set off on his bike to get help			1
