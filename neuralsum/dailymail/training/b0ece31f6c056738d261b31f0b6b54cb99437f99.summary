by @entity0 published : 01:53 est , 19 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:37 est , 19 february 2014 a deranged nanny hated her bosses so much she replaced a bedside water bottle with toilet effluent and dipped their toothbrushes in the loo , she has confided to a @entity11 advice columnist			1
the former live - in nanny revealed the dirty secret and said after suffering in the role for three months , she got her bosses , a married couple , back for being " annoying and inconsiderate "			1
' i occasionally took revenge by sneaking into their bathroom and dipping their toothbrushes in the toilet , ' she said			1
wrong : the nanny 's revenge could result in serious medical implications according to @entity27 , the woman said before quitting for the sake of her mental health , she invented other deranged ways of getting revenge			1
' the wife kept a drink bottle by the bedside table and i also put some toilet water into it as well , ' she said			1
' it made me feel better about my crappy situation at the time but now that i 've quit ( and regained some of my sanity ) , i 'm consumed with guilt			2
' the woman said there may have been some serious consequences as a result of the action she took			2
' i heard from a mutual acquaintance that both of them are having some kind of health problem - exactly what , i do n't knowâ € ” and i 'm worried i may have caused this , ' she said			2
she finished by asking for some advice			1
' should i call and confess ? we did n't exactly leave on good terms			0
' the response from ' @entity60 ' was amusing but possibly not as reassuring as hoped			0
' this is indeed a crappy situation all around			0
i 'm actually surprised you quit because given your response to what you say was intolerable treatment by your employers , you attempted to cause them grave bodily harm - you all sound perfectly matched ! ' she said			0
think twice : the advice columnist said the drastic revenge was stomach - turning ' making people ingest fecal matter without their knowledge is indeed likely to make people ill and leave their doctor baffled			1
' but despite confessing all , the disgruntled employee was advised not to own up to the horrid act as she could face drastic consequences			1
' part of me would love to tell you to rush to confess			0
however , i will extend you a courtesy that you did n't give your " inconsiderate " and " rude " employers , ' she said			2
she said legal advice should be sought in the wake of the stomach - turning revenge			1
' while i think this couple should know the source of their illness , confessing could leave you open to potential prosecution			0
you may deserve it , but you need to consider the stakes here			0
' ' so my suggestion is that you pay for a consultation with a lawyer and explain the situation			0
you also should find out what are the potential medical consequences of drinking toilet water			1
it may be that the need to get a proper diagnosis for this pair is crucial to their treatment , and you must consider that and bring it to the attention of your lawyer			0
' @entity116 finished off by offering one last piece of advice			2
' while your behavior makes my stomach turn , i am slightly heartened that you seem to recognise what you did was an abomination			0
i hope in the future you recognise that if you 're in a poisonous situation , you simply get out without trying to poison anyone else , ' she said .			0
