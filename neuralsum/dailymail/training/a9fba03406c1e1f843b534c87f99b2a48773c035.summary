@entity0 has been accused by the @entity1 of reclaiming land on a reef in disputed islands to build an airstrip just days after @entity6 described @entity8 's actions in the region as ' provocative '			1
if confirmed , the airstrip would be the first built by @entity0 on any of the eight reefs and islands it occupies in the @entity13 in the @entity14			0
it would also mark a significant escalation in tensions involving several nations in the area			0
@entity0 claims almost the entire @entity14 , an area rich in energy deposits and an important passageway traversed each year by $ 5trillion worth of ship - borne goods			2
@entity1 foreign ministry spokesman @entity42 told @entity44 that @entity0 had been moving earth and materials to @entity47 , known by the @entity0 as @entity48 , in recent weeks			1
he said @entity0 was reclaiming land in violation of the @entity51 on the conduct of parties in the @entity14 , an informal code of conduct for the region			0
' they 're about to build an airstrip , ' @entity42 said			0
he said evidence of the @entity0 activity on the reef had been shown in aerial photographs taken by the @entity63			0

@entity8 and @entity73 each accused the other of ramming its ships near the disputed @entity76 where @entity0 has moved a large oil rig the @entity1 and @entity39 already have airstrips in the area			1
the ministry had already lodged a protest with the @entity0 and raised the issue behind closed doors at last weekend 's summit of the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity42 said			2
tensions in the @entity14 were already high after @entity0 moved a large oil rig into an area also claimed by @entity25			1
@entity8 and @entity73 each accused the other of ramming its ships near the disputed @entity76			1
it came as @entity25 's prime minister sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defense of the country 's sovereignty following @entity0 's deployment of the oil rig , but said that ' bad elements ' should n't be allowed to engage in violence			1
the message , sent late thursday and friday to subscribers via major state - owned cellphone operators , did n't directly condemn the riots that have broken out this week following @entity0 's decision to deploy the rig off the coast of central @entity25 on may 1			1
@entity25 's prime minister sent a text message to millions of citizens urging them to act in defense of the country 's sovereignty following @entity0 's deployment of the oil rig on the lookout : a @entity25 coast guard officer watches one of his vessels vessel in the @entity14 @entity25 patrol ships sent to disrupt the rig are currently locked in a tense standoff with @entity0 ships guarding it			1
anti-china protests that started peacefully have ended in violence and vandalism , with 400 factories suspected of having links with @entity0 destroyed or damaged by mobs			0
one @entity0 worker was killed and scores more injured at a huge @entity39 steel mill that was overrun by a 1,000 - strong crowd			0
' the prime minister requests and calls on every @entity25 to boost their patriotism to defend the fatherland 's sacred sovereignty with actions in line with the law , ' the text message said			2
' bad elements should not be allowed to instigate extremist actions that harm the interests and image of the country			0
' there were no reports of any new violence or protests on friday			0
firefighters stand across from the main entrance of @entity154 as the @entity39 bicycle factory burns , in @entity156 , @entity157 province , @entity25 protesters stand on the corner of a street in @entity157 province , near @entity162 in @entity25 @entity25 's authoritarian leaders typically clamp down on public protests of any sort , but have allowed them this time			2
preventing people from demonstrating would have given fuel to domestic critics of the government who already accuse it of being soft on @entity8			0
the government is also able to use the nationalist sentiment of its people to amplify its protests to @entity8			0
but violence that harms foreign investment and risks spinning out of control is unlikely to fit into this strategy , and the government will attempt to ensure that it does n't break out again , most analysts say			0
@entity0 and @entity25 have tussled for years over competing territorial claims , as have the @entity1 and @entity0			1
but @entity8 's desire for oil and gas , and its growing economic and military might , have seen it take an increasingly assertive stance to its claims in the sea , triggering increased tensions and incidents between it and claimant states			2
the anti-china violence on the streets is only inflaming the relationship further			0
@entity0 said its foreign minister , @entity198 , called @entity25 foreign minister @entity199 on thursday and expressed @entity8 's ' strong condemnation and stern protest ' over the violence against @entity0 and other foreign nationals and businesses			1
