so i get in my car and i just went , started crying , started getting really emotional and i think it was just a mixture of what i ’ve just said , saying goodbye to people for maybe the last time , and the pressure that i put myself under			2
clapping them off : @entity0 after his final match in charge of @entity2 , at @entity35 ‘ it sounds stupid now , but it ’s just not me , it ’s just not me at all			1

maybe i was a little bit too soft			0
baby steps : even though @entity0 was advised by sir @entity118 ( right ) , he was still not prepared for the job ‘ i do n’t care where you are in the league and i do n’t care if the results have been going badly , if you step on to that pitch as a @entity2 player you give it your all , and if you do n’t then you deserve not to play the next game			1
‘ i think i ’ve always had a will to win			0
from an early age i was used to winning and it ’s that fear of losing because you know losing is a much bigger emotion than winning			0
‘ when you win it ’s great , but then it goes away			0
