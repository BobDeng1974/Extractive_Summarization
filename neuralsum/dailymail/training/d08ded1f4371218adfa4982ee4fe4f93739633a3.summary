by @entity0 last updated at 3:12 pm on 22nd december 2011 scientists still have only seen glimpses of the ' cosmic dawn ' , when stars were forming in the calm , dark cosmos			2
an international team lead by @entity7 of the @entity8 has found the most vigorous star - forming galaxy yet seen from the period - a huge mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year			1
it 's one of the most distant galaxies ever seen by mankind - and it 's also unique			2
although nine galaxies have been detected from the period just after @entity20 , the 750 - million - year - old @entity21 was forming stars far faster than the others , when most of the universe was still cold and dark			1
a researcher at the @entity8 has found the most vigorous star - forming galaxy yet seen from the cold , dark period just after the @entity20 - a large mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year the team obtained calculated the galaxy 's distance from @entity36 to confirm that it is one of the most distant galaxies ever discovered			1
analysis of @entity42 images showed intense brightness that made it clear stars were forming rapidly			0
the astronomers found a large mass of gas , equivalent to about a hundred @entity49 per year , was forming stars			0
team leader @entity7 said , ' the significant finding about @entity52 is that it demonstrates the existence of a vigorous star - forming galaxy when the universe was still very cold and dark			1
' the star was discovered by the @entity57 in @entity58 - then astronomers observed it with a spectrograph from the @entity62 , also on @entity58 , to confirm its distance from earth			0
astronomers have so far detected nine galaxies from the period 600 to 800 million years after the @entity20 - the ' cosmic dawn ' - but @entity52 - 108036 the most active star - forming region detected to date @entity69 at the @entity8 , a team member and the leading author of the article , said , ' we went back and repeated our observations on three different occasions over two years			1
we observed the feature at the same wavelength on each occasion			0
it is undisputed evidence for the huge distance to the galaxy			0
' the astronomers searched for a sign of detection by using recent observations of the @entity88 field with the @entity42 's newly - installed camera , @entity90			0
they confirmed detection of @entity52 in the @entity90 image ; the galaxy 's intense brightness in the intrinsic ultraviolet indicated that it contained many young , massive stars			2
' the amount of stars born every year was more than ten times higher than those in the other galaxies at a comparable distance , ' explained @entity69			0
' we 're surprised to know that such a vigorous galaxy existed at a time when the universe was only five percent of its present age			1
