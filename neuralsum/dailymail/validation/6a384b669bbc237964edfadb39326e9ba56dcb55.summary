from peacocks to birds of paradise , male birds are well known for showing off their brightly coloured plumage as a way of attracting a mate			1
however , new research has suggested that males birds may actually be growing less distinct from their female counterparts over time			2
the findings challenge a key element of the evolutionary theory that was first proposed by @entity13 156 years ago			1
male and female @entity14 's ( pictured above ) both share the same brightly coloured plumage , suggesting another force other than sexual selection is driving the evolution of bright colours in feathers of some birds rather than the bright colours of male birds appearing because of sexual selection - where a trait evolves over time because it is seen as attractive or a signal of fitness by the opposite sex - other forces of natural selection are at work			1
the researchers say that the environment a species lives in , how it cares of its young and migratory behaviour appear to influence a species plumage			1
@entity39 tails may be hard to miss , but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird 's pretty plumage			1
scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear			0
male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate			2
researchers at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them			2
most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz			0
when peacocks shake their tale feathers , most humans hear a rustling sound			0
but the scienitsts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal @entity72			1
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response			1
experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound , but know that some can feel vibration through their legs			0
professor @entity85 , a biologist at the @entity86 , said : ' a lot of research has focused on how plumage color is related to mating success , especially in males			2
' so this should hopefully get researchers to think more about how color affects survival , especially predation and foraging success , in both sexes			0
' the debate over the differences in colour between species of birds has raged ever since the time of @entity13 and @entity105			1
while @entity13 based his theory of sexual selection on the idea that brightly coloured males were preferred by females , giving them a competitive advantage , @entity105 pointed out that in many species females are as brilliantly coloured as the male			1
he suggested instead that the differences between the sexes - known as sexual dichromatism - were the result of females needing better camouflage to prevent their nests from being raided by predators			2
some scientists have also puzzled at how bright plumage in males can have evolved when it potentially makes them a more visible target for predators			0
this would suggest that sexual preference for bright colours plays a more powerful role in determining the evolution of a species than other pressures			2
in an attempt to test these ideas , professor @entity85 and his colleagues decided to analyse the plumage of 977 species of bird - around 10 per cent of all known species			1
using museum specimens , they measured the spectrum of light reflected from the plumage of both male and female birds			1
they found that on the whole males tended to have brighter feathers than females			0
male northern cardinals usually have bright red plumage ( left ) while females are a drab grey or brown ( right ) this male @entity158 finch has bright and vibrant plumage			0
females have similar colours but are not as bright but in about 45 per cent of bird species both sexes had plumage that the same level of brightness			1
by looking at where the birds sat in the phylogenetic tree , however , they were able to conclude that over evolutionary time the colour difference between species appears to have declined			2
in some cases males have become duller in their colours while in others females have evolved brighter plumage			2
they found both sexes would have duller plumage when the birds tended have more sedentary behaviour or bred in the tropics or had young that needed more care , and in species where males played little role in caring for young			1
peacocks have brightly coloured plumage that they shake to attract the much duller coloured peahens to mate writing in the journal @entity194 , professor @entity85 and his colleagues said : ' although most studies of bird plumage focus on dichromatism , evolutionary change has most often led to similar , rather than different , plumage in males and females			0
' overall , both natural and sexual selection have influenced the evolution of bird coloration , but in many respects , they have acted on two different axes : sexual selection on an axis of sexual differences and natural selection on an axis of color ( for example , dull or bright ) in both sexes			1
' thus , debate about the causes of variation in bird coloration may be resolved by recognizing that natural and sexual selection have generally acted on two different axes			1
' biologists have been baffled as to how male @entity225 emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring			0
while the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate , it should also make them easy for predators to spot			0
however , researchers from the @entity234 in @entity235 and the @entity236 of @entity237 , @entity238 , have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry @entity241 - their own cloaking device			0
they discovered that the lizards ' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from			0
when viewed from above , the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds			0
however , when viewed from ground level , the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate			0
iberian emerald lizard 's skin makes the invisible from above but gives them bright colours at ground level			0

study was *conducted* by researchers at @entity86
they measured the male and female plumage colour of 977 bird species
the researchers found some species show differences between the sexes while others have evolved so both sexes have the same plumage colours
the findings challenge @entity13 's theory of sexual selection in birds
