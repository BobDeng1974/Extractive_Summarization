it accentuated their symbolic role as boundary zones , and the role of the king as the divinely appointed guardian or gate keeper of the community			0
by the ninth and eighth centuries @entity39 , these elaborately decorated gateways , with their ornately carved reliefs , had come to serve as dynastic parades , legitimizing the power of the ruling elite			0
