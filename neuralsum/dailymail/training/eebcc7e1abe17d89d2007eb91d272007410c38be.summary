a group of cannibal seals have been blamed for a mystery wildlife slaying which saw the bodies of 80 others wash ashore			1
police launched an investigation when the carcasses of dozens of harbour seals first appeared on the @entity10 coast five years ago with ' corkscrew ' wounds on their skin			1
they were the victims of a batch of larger rogue grey seals , scientists have revealed , after previously blaming the deaths on sharks in @entity20			1
predators ? a batch of rogue grey seals have been fingered as the culprits of more than 80 seal pup deaths across the @entity26 ( file image above ) the animals washed up in a sea colony near @entity31 , @entity32 , and in the waters of the @entity34 and @entity35 , their bodies partially eaten			1
investigators considered other factors such as boat propellers and other sea life before discovering the animals had been killed by the larger species keepers even watched one of the creatures killing five smaller seals at the @entity46 in @entity35			1
the animal left wide , slashed cuts known as spiral or corkscrew wounds on each of the victims			0
there are only two species of seal permanently residing in @entity56			0
they are the @entity58 and the @entity60 seal			0
both spend much of their time in the sea but come ashore to breed and moult			2
the animals , which often co-exist in patches of water along the coastline , can be difficult to tell apart - especially when their coats are wet			2
grey seals have a more distinctive face with hooked noses			1
they are also larger than the common seal , with an adult male the largest land - breeding animal in @entity56			2
' @entity78 environment secretary @entity77 said : ' the clusters of ” corkscrew seal ” deaths were unusual and worrying , ' said @entity78 environment secretary @entity77			0
' in common with many of the creatures that live in our seas , seals are animals that are loved by the public			1
' it is very important that we understand what caused these unusual deaths and we now have important evidence that natural predatory behaviour is likely to be the main cause , rather than ship propeller injuries as we first thought			2
' this provides some reassurance for the shipping industry			0
' this information will help to inform regulators , developers and others enabling them to take it into account in their activities			0
' @entity106 will continue to monitor our seal population for further injuries and any evidence about the causes			0
' more than 80 harbour seals and pups were killed in the slaying			1
the species ( pictured above ) is slightly smaller than the grey seal			0
