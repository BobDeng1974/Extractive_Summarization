@entity0 looks to have secured at least another season at @entity2 not least because of his exploits at this @entity4			1
@entity5 striker @entity0 has hit three goals and been credited with two assists enhancing his reputation as a world - class striker			1
but for some time the @entity2 hierarchy have seen him a disposable asset and it was thought he would be put up for offer this summer with the club looking to sign @entity14			1
all white on the night : @entity0 has scored three times for @entity5 at the @entity4 , including a double against @entity18 in training : @entity0 is put through his paces for @entity5 ahead of their last - 16 clash against @entity23 on monday just to confirm what already know ( that @entity25 are better than @entity26 ) , since the 1966 @entity4 win the @entity27 's have advanced further than @entity26 all eleven subsequent @entity4 finals			1
real though have backed off their pursuit of @entity14 with @entity30 now in pole position to sign the disgraced @entity33 striker			2
and manager @entity34 , who he retained his job by winning the @entity37 , has argued the case to keep @entity0 with the club 's hierarchy			1
the player has also benefited from the support of former @entity5 @entity4 winner @entity43 , who is being groomed as @entity2 's next boss , having just left his role as @entity34 's assistant to take charge of @entity48 , @entity2 's feeder club			1
@entity23 's @entity50 is the first @entity51 manager to lead an @entity51 side into the knockout stages of a @entity4			1
on the previous nine occasions @entity51 sides have gone beyond the group stages they have been managed by overseas bosses			2
this is the fourth time @entity23 have made this stage			2
as a player @entity50 played most of his football in @entity61 , was captain of @entity23 in 1994 but was then controversially dropped and last year as @entity23 manager led them to @entity66 success			2
@entity68 favourites over stormy @entity23 making history : @entity23 's @entity50 is the first @entity51 to guide a team from @entity51 to the knockout stages the build up to @entity73 's clash has been about avenging the injustice they believed they suffered when @entity25 knocked them out of the 1982 @entity4			1
a low scoring win for @entity25 over neighbour @entity79 would see both countries go through at the expense of @entity73			2
after an early goal for the @entity27 , the game was played at walking pace and both sets of players celebrated at the end in what has become known as the @entity91 game			0
but it 's not the only time there has been some dodgy goings at @entity95 not least for @entity96 in 1974			0
the @entity97 had beaten a rough and raw @entity98 2 - 0 and held @entity100 0 - 0			0
but inexplicably @entity98 then lost 9 - 0 , a record at the finals , to @entity103			0
the ' brown envelope ' suspicion surrounding that capitulation was heightened given @entity98 then only lost 3 - 0 to @entity100 in their final game			0
@entity103 then had to hold @entity96 to a draw , which they did , to qualify thanks to that goal difference stacked up against @entity98 whose manager was @entity113 and , er , a @entity114			0
@entity115 suffered heartache by going out on penalties to @entity118			0
but their players then displayed great heart and generosity by donating all their @entity4 bonuses to fund a new national training centre			1
the squad issued a statement saying : ' we do not want extra bonus , or money			0
we only play for @entity115 and its people			0
' all we want is for you to support our effort to find a land and create a sports centre that will house our national team			2
' heartbreak : @entity115 crashed out of the @entity4 after losing a dramatic penalty shootout to @entity118 could @entity137 eventually succeed @entity138 as the rock of @entity141 's defence ? how the 20 - year - old copes with the @entity5 attack today will be a great test for a player @entity141 signed from @entity146 two summers ago and spent last year on loan at @entity149			1
case for the defence : @entity137 signed from @entity141 two summers ago and has been on loan at @entity146 @entity23 should have progressed to the quarter - finals of the 1994 @entity4 and perhaps gone all the way			1
they were leading @entity155 1 - 0 and looking in control but then @entity155 's enigma of that era @entity159 suddenly showed what he could do			0
@entity155 equalised when @entity159 scored from the spot in extra time			0
@entity155 went to lose the final to @entity100 in a penalty shoot out in the decisive kick by @entity159 known as the @entity166 which went way over bar .			0

@entity0 looks to have secured at least another season at @entity2
the @entity5 striker has *netted* three goals at the @entity4
@entity34 has argued the case to keep @entity0 at @entity2
he has also benefitted from the support of @entity5 *legend* @entity177
