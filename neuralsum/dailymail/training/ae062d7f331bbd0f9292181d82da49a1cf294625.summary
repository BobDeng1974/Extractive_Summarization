dried tomato skins left over from the making of @entity3 ketchup are to be used inside @entity5 cars as a plant - based alternative to plastic			1
the tinned - food giant known for its ' 57 varieties ' is looking at how it could use its bio-waste to create a ' green ' replacement for petroleum - based plastic inside the cars such as the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity5 scientists are testing the durability of tomato fibre – made largely from waste peeled tomato skins , stems and seeds – for potential use in making wiring brackets and storage bins			2
innovative : the dried remains of tomatoes from @entity3 tomato ketchup factories will be used to develop compartments for the inside of @entity5 cars in a bid to cut down on petroleum - based materials the firms say it will reduce the use of petrochemicals used in the manufacture of plastic and so reduce the harmful impact on the environment			1
@entity5 plastics research specialist @entity45 said : ‘ dried tomato skins could become the wiring brackets in a @entity5 vehicle or the storage bin a customer uses to hold coins and other small objects			1
‘ we are exploring whether this food processing by - product makes sense for an automotive application			0
project : how @entity5 and @entity3 intend to work together ‘ our goal is to develop a strong , lightweight material that meets our vehicle requirements , while at the same time reducing our overall environmental impact			0
’ it is part of a project begun nearly two years ago when @entity5 began collaborating with @entity3 , @entity65 , sports clothing firm @entity66 , and @entity67			2
the scheme is a bid to accelerate development of a ‘ plant - based plastic ’ to help reduce use of petroleum - based materials currently in use			1
@entity3 ’s research and development associate director @entity75 said : ‘ our researchers were looking for innovative ways to recycle peels , stems and seeds from the more than two million tons of tomatoes the company uses annually to produce its best - selling product , @entity83			0
‘ we are delighted that the technology has been validated			0
' although we are in the very early stages of research , and many questions remain , we are excited about the possibilities this could produce for both @entity3 and @entity5 and the advancement of sustainable 100 per cent plant - based plastics			2
’ @entity5 said its commitment to ‘ reduce , reuse and recycle ’ is part of the company ’s global ‘ green ’ strategy to lessen its environmental footprint while accelerating development of fuel - efficient vehicle technology worldwide			2
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ @entity5 has increased its use of recycled non-metal and bio-based materials			0
' @entity108 is used to make electrical cowl brackets introduced in the last year , @entity5 ’s bio-based portfolio now includes eight materials in production			0
' other examples include coconut - based composite materials , recycled cotton for carpeting and seat fabrics , plus soy foam seat cushions and head restraints			1
' @entity5 employs 183,000 employees at 65 plants worldwide , including @entity121 .			0
