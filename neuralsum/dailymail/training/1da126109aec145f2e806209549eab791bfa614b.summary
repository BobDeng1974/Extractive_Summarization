little did the drivers of the snow plow know that surveillance cameras were watching their every dig. video shows the snow plow heading straight for a state transportation truck that was left at the @entity16 , @entity18 yard all day and night on february 5			1
watch video a storm left @entity16 with 11 inches , and the snow plow driver decided to put most of that remaining snow on the truck in the lot			2
@entity26 footage shows how other cars moved so that the snow plow could do it 's work but that one truck remained stationary			2
the driver who uses the truck lives in @entity16 but is not permitted to drive state vehicles home with him when he is not working			0
he is meant to keep them in in municipal lots			0
when the driver discovered his truck beneath tons of snow and finally dug it out the next day , he noticed that the left rear corner panel was dented			0
no charges were filed and the incident will not be addressed publicly but @entity16 's city manager @entity41 said the employees would be disciplined			2
' the fact that the vehicle was completely covered to the extent that you could not tell there was a vehicle under the snow exhibits that the behavior was intentional , said @entity51			1
the drivers , whose names have not been released , have apologized for their actions			0
they wont be causing anymore mischief -- on camera , that is			0
look closely and you 'll see a snowplow pushing snow over a truck in the parking lot footage shows cars driving away from the snow plow so that it may shovel away the snow more easily the driver of the truck was not permitted to drive the state vehicle home so he left it in the parking lot for the mischievous snow plow driver to bury the snow plow drivers might have thought twice about burying the vehicle had they seen this surveillance camera looming above them			1

surveillance footage *captured* footage of a snow plow burying a state owned truck that was left *overnight*
the snow plow drivers did not face charges but they ' will be disciplined '
' the fact that the vehicle was completely covered to the extent that you could not tell there was a vehicle under the snow exhibits that the behavior was intentional ' , said town manager @entity41
