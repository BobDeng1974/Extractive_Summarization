by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 six years ago @entity2 was contemplating putting his economics degree to use after being released by @entity4 but now finds himself at the head of a queue of left - arm bowlers competing to fill the missing link in @entity11 ’s attack			1
@entity2 could never have dreamed that he would be playing in sunday 's second one - day international against @entity12 at @entity13 when his native county turned their back on him just after he had left @entity17			1
‘ there were dark times in my early years on the county scene when i wondered whether i would end up making it , so to be here now is amazing , ’ said @entity2 , who has been given his big chance in the early summer internationals			2
he 's flying now : @entity2 is leading @entity11 's attack six years after being released by @entity4 hat - trick : @entity2 wraps up warm as he trains at @entity25 ahead of the second odi vs @entity12 only when @entity4 had second thoughts and invited @entity2 back for a trial at the start of 2009 did his fortunes take a turn for the better			1
‘ i initially turned it down and went away but if i ’m honest there was n’t a huge amount of interest from other counties , ’ admitted @entity2			0
‘ so i agreed to go back on trial for the first eight weeks of the season			0
thankfully i went back in and performed well and they ended up signing me again			0
’ even then @entity2 did not exactly set the county scene ablaze and he was far from a regular in the @entity4 side before @entity43 asked him to make the same short journey from @entity45 to @entity46 that made @entity47			1
‘ in five or six years i only played around 16 first - class games and they were generally when there was an injury to someone else , ’ said @entity2 , 27			2
‘ so i never really got the chance to get going in that format			0
there were times when my position was touch and go so i ’ll always be grateful to mick for coming and signing me for @entity58			0
’ toppling the king : @entity2 looks on after cleaning up @entity61 legend @entity60 age 27			0
county : @entity58 first - class career matches : 47 wickets : 119 best bowling ( inns ) : 5/81 best bowling ( match ) : 7/148 average 33.92			2
5wkt inns : 2 @entity2 has excelled with @entity72 to such an extent that he was invited to bowl at @entity11 ’s @entity76 batsmen for a month last winter and has been picked by @entity77 , a big fan of left - arm seamers after promoting @entity79 to the @entity11 side in his first spell as coach , in his first three games back at the helm			1
it was three years ago that @entity86 , the @entity11 bowling coach , said his attack would be complete if he could find a good left - armer and now @entity2 has his chance ahead of a promising crop that includes @entity91 , @entity92 ( both of @entity93 ) and @entity94 , @entity95 ' young star			1
‘ i did wonder at one stage of my career whether i ’d end up in a suit down in @entity100 but i ’d certainly rather be running around on a cricket field , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ playing for @entity11 was beyond my dreams growing up but it ’s been amazing so far and i want to carry on doing it for as long as i can			0
’ well done : @entity2 gets a pat on the back from @entity106 ( right ) during a good display against @entity12			1

@entity2 nearly dropped out of cricket after release by @entity4
@entity43 took a punt on @entity2 and took him to @entity58
the left - armer was taken by @entity11 to @entity115 as a net bowler
@entity2 has *impressed* in his two internationals against @entity12
