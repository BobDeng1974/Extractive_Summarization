@entity0 is the right / left chicane at the end of the wide start straight at which the cars of @entity6 and @entity7 are likely to be close enough for mutual destruction			1
those two title rivals will start the @entity11 @entity10 on the front row of the grid , @entity6 on pole , @entity7 alongside him			1
within a few gear - flicking seconds , the road will narrow and the two of them will try to thread their silver @entity19 over the kerbs in the shortest and fastest way			1
both hope to reach the flat - out @entity23			2
but there are no guarantees that they will reach there , and none that they will leave there			0
@entity6 ( @entity19 ) 2			1
@entity7 ( @entity19 ) 3			1

@entity55 ( @entity56 ) in front of up to 100,000 in this crumpled cathedral of @entity11 motor racing at the centre of the tree - strewn @entity63 , the latest unmissable instalment of the 2014 world championship will unfold			1
most of those here with their banners are disciples of @entity51 , the team that @entity69 built into an icon of a nation , but with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace , it is the tussle between a cerebral @entity75 and an instinctive @entity76 that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon			2
the backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at @entity80 , where @entity6 and @entity7 collided on the second lap. @entity6 ultimately retired from the race			1
@entity7 , the aggressor , survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the drivers ’ championship to 29 points			1
the row afterwards was even more feisty			2
it ended up with @entity7 being fined by @entity19 and apologising to his team , his rival and the seemingly the whole world			1
both were warned to keep it clean , though their management will permit them to race free of team orders			0
back on track : @entity6 celebrates after claiming pole in @entity100 @entity102 setter : @entity7 leads the drivers ' championship by 29 points but will start behind @entity6 on sunday @entity106 : @entity7 was prevented from getting a fifth consecutive pole by his @entity19 team - mate so after @entity6 claimed his first pole since the @entity110 @entity10 more than half - a - season ago – on may 10 – the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments tomorrow along the fastest lap in @entity115 the keep - it - clean instruction be in their minds ? ‘ it wo n’t be ringing in my ears , ’ said @entity6			1
sitting next to him , @entity7 said : ‘ it ’s a question i am not able to answer			1
the message is that we keep on racing			0
’ fasten your seat belts			0
@entity6 was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference			1
‘ it is a great feeling to be up here he said , ’ with all the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted @entity7 ’s run of six poles in seven races			2
‘ as for me , i ’m … looking forward to it			0
’ @entity19 ’ outright pace suggest they should be too strong to be challenged , yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected			2
@entity6 sat out an hour of friday ’s second practice session with an electrical problem and @entity7 missed yesterday practice with a faulty gearbox			1
‘ every race is important , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ but time is running out			0
’ podium position : @entity39 took @entity45 to third as the only team to challenge @entity19 true @entity147 : @entity49 's future at @entity48 remains uncertain - his contract expires at the end of the year all the top six – @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity39 in third , his @entity45 team - mate @entity46 and the @entity48 pair of @entity47 and @entity49 are powered by @entity19 engines			1
to the disgruntlement of the @entity157 fans @entity50 starts in seventh place while the second @entity51 of @entity159 was only 12th fastest			2
@entity51 ’s recent dismal run of form led the @entity100 rumour - mill to suggest that @entity163 , the 67 - year - old team president , might stand down after more than 40 years of high - level service with the company			1
but with a sweep of his hair , he dismissed tales of his demise			0
‘ i told the @entity171 board in march that i was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people , the women and men of the @entity51 , ’ he said			0
‘ they are the most important part of my life and i took a commitment with them			0
@entity11 job : @entity50 carries the hopes of @entity51 and the @entity11 home crowd prancing pony : @entity50 speaks with @entity51 's president @entity163 ‘ we are preparing an historic record at the end of this year in terms of financial and economical results , so @entity51 is facing a fantastic moment			2
‘ if and when there is some news about me , i will be the first – i emphasise the first – to let you know			0
’ rookie : @entity48 driver @entity47 ahead of @entity51 's @entity50 dark horse : @entity54 will start the race from the fourth row along with team - mate @entity52 must do better : former world champion @entity159 went out at the second stage of qualifying @entity163 is not only a great survivor but among @entity200 ’s big beasts , a name to set alongside the likes of @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			1
@entity204 derided him as a bella figura – roughly translated as all fur coat and no knickers			0
living up to his theatrical billing , @entity209 enveloped @entity50 in a long , lingering , listing hug			0
another hugger was @entity6 , embracing his dad @entity213 on the way to the car			2
there is at least some love here among the enmity .			0

@entity6 claimed his first pole position since may 's @entity110 @entity10
his @entity19 team - mate @entity7 will join him on the front row
@entity39 will start in third with @entity46 fourth on the grid
@entity159 's *troubled* year continued as he failed to *progress* from @entity229
