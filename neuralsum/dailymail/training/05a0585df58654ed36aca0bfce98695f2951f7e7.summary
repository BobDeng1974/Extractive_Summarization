by @entity0 published : 23:34 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 9 august 2013 demand from wealthy overseas buyers for multi-million pound @entity5 homes is fuelling a property bubble in the capital , experts say			1
high - end property prices are soaring as @entity5 becomes ever more attractive to foreign investors seeking a ' safe haven ' for their cash , amid economic and political instability in many other parts of the world			1
meanwhile new figures reveal a boom in the buy - to - let market , with lending to landlords topping £ 5billion			1
booming market : the number of buy - to - let mortgage lenders has surged to levels not seen since 2008 some 40,000 buy - to - let mortgages were advanced in the three months until the end of june , worth £ 5.1bn in total			1
demand for buy - to - let properties has also seen house prices driven up further in the capital , where one expert described an £ 850,000 house in @entity34 that would give a gross rental yield of just 3.6 per cent before any costs to the landlord			1
' that just can not carry on , ' buying agent @entity38 told the @entity40 , adding that the capital was ' in a bubble '			0
but mr @entity38 said that , with @entity5 now on the radar of wealthy @entity45 , the bubble would ' grow before it pops '			2
boom : house prices are creeping up to levels not seen since the financial crash bubble : demand from wealthy overseas buyers is driving up property prices in @entity54 , @entity55 , and other boroughs of the capital identified as @entity5 the 40,000 buy - to - let mortgages advanced in the three months to the end of june marked an increase of just under a fifth from the first three months of the year , according to figures from the @entity63 ( @entity63 )			1
it included a 24 per cent rise in remortgaging as landlords took advantage of cheaper deals on offer from banks and building societies			0
demand : multi-million pound properties in @entity5 's most exclusive areas are being snapped up by international buyers it means the buy - to - let market is now at its most buoyant since the third quarter of 2008 , when the collapse of @entity80 investment bank @entity79 sent global markets into freefall			1
but it remains much lower than at the peak of the housing market boom in the summer of 2007 when £ 12.7bn was lent in just three months			2
@entity86 , head of policy at the @entity63 , said the recent surge had been driven by strong demand from renters as well as low interest rates			0
new role : @entity93 , governor of the @entity94 , said interest rates could stay at a record low she said : ‘ these conditions are creating more opportunities for landlords to remortgage , as well as helping to fund increased activity in the mortgage market more generally			0
’ but last night campaigners said the figures highlighted the widening gulf between the fortunes of borrowers and savers			0
dr @entity109 , a former government adviser and savings expert , said : ‘ this is great news for borrowers			0
‘ those who have got plenty of money and can afford a second property are able to borrow at record low rates			0
‘ but people who have done the right thing and saved for the future are being wiped out			0
’ meanwhile the number of properties in @entity5 's most desirable postcodes being snapped up by foreign buyers has sparked fears @entity126 buyers are being priced out of the market			1
buying agent mr @entity38 said the property market in the capital had ' lost touch with reality ' , pointing to soaring profits at upmarket estate agency @entity133 for evidence of ' everything you need to know about the housing market '			0
thanks to booming sales in @entity139 and @entity133 average sale price has risen 18 per cent to £ 3.2million			0
@entity141 and financial consultancy @entity142 identifies the most monied areas of the capital - including @entity139 and @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity145 and @entity146 - as @entity5			0
it said more than half of @entity150 properties that sold for upwards of £ 2million in the 12 months to march this year went to overseas buyers			1
when it comes to the most expensive of properties the trend is even more pronounced - the proportion of £ 5million plus properties bought with foreign cash is closer to 60 per cent , the report said			1
according to @entity161 , the prime @entity5 market is currently more overvalued than any time since 1995 at the latest			1
@entity5 : the rise in house prices across the country is most pronounced in exclusive areas of the capital @entity167 , the @entity139 - based managing director of estate agent @entity168 , told the @entity40 the boom in international buyers meant @entity5 was effectively becoming a ' land bank '			1
from @entity54 to @entity145 , house prices in @entity5 's most desirable postcodes are soaring			1
and a @entity142 report reveals that , when it comes to multi-million pound properties , overseas buyers account for more than half of all sales			1
but what is it that makes international buyers so keen to spend their money in @entity5 ? according to @entity161 , there are three main factors contributing to the popularity of the capital 's most exclusive areas			0
first , the weakness of the pound means beneficial exchange rates can boost foreign buyers ' spending power			2
second , the performance of global equity markets , and third , the perception of @entity5 as a ' safe haven ' in which to invest money - immune from the troubles of the euro			0
he said : ' would you put your money into the euro or sterling if you were a @entity207 ? ' do you trust @entity208 , @entity209 of @entity210 for laws on property , tax , the government and economic stability more than @entity126 ? ' but @entity217 chief executive @entity216 said it was inaccurate to suggest @entity126 buyers were being priced out of the market by overseas investors			2
' they are still the majority buyers of secondhand properties and that trend is increasing , ' he said			0
nonetheless prices continue to rise , with @entity226 forecasting prime @entity5 properties to go up by 8 per cent a year between now and 2018			1
sales director @entity228 said the estate agency was busier now than even 2007 - before the financial crash			0
while the rest of the country has not quite reached the heady heights of the @entity5 property market , house prices are rising thanks to the drop in mortgage rates since the government introduced its @entity240 to breathe life into the economy last summer			1
but the stimulus plan has caused misery for savers as banks have also rushed to cut interest rates on deposit accounts			0
the bottomless pit of cheap money from the @entity94 means they no longer need to attract savers ’ cash by paying competitive returns			0
on wednesday the @entity94 said that rates could stay at a record low of 0.5pc for another three years , as it unveiled its new ‘ forward guidance ’ policy			0
figures released today from estate agency group @entity260 show that house prices in @entity262 and @entity263 have reached their highest ever level - higher than the 2007 peak			2
an average house now costs £ 232,969 - an increase of more than £ 500 a month in the past year			1
according to @entity133 , which sells high - end property , the average price of its @entity5 portfolio is £ 3.2m			2
@entity270 also confirmed that house prices have been increasing at their fastest rate in three years			2
@entity273 , chief economist at @entity274 , told @entity40 : ' the danger is that , when a flood tide of mortgage finance meets a chronic shortage of housing , the result will be an escalation of house prices			2
