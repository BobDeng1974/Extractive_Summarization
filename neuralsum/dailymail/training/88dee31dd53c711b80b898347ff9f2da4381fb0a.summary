there is no clear link between passive smoking and lung cancer , @entity1 scientists have claimed			1
researchers from @entity7 say their findings add to a body of evidence which shows that while smoking cigarettes is strongly linked to cancer , passive smoking is not			2
their large @entity1 study of more than 76,000 women did not find a link between the disease and secondhand smoke			1
only people who live in the same house as a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer , they say			1
scientists from @entity7 claim only people living with a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer ‘ the fact that passive smoking may not be strongly associated with lung cancer points to a need to find other risk factors for the disease [ in nonsmokers ] , ’ said @entity27 , a medical student at @entity7 , who presented the study at the meeting of @entity30 in @entity31			1
researchers from the university and other institutions examined data from the @entity42 to come up with their controversial findings			0
data for 76,304 participants about passive smoking exposure in childhood , the adult home and work for was studied			0
of those that took part , 901 people developed lung cancer over 10.5 years of follow - up			1
the study , published in the @entity57 said the incidence of lung cancer was 13 times higher in current smokers and four times higher in former smokers than those who have never smoked cigarettes			2
unsurprisingly , the risk of the disease for both current and former smokers depended on their level of exposure			0
the study claims the incidence of lung cancer was 13 times higher in current smokers and four times higher in former smokers than those who have never smoked cigarettes however , among the women who had never smoked and those who were exposed to secondhand smoke , there was not any ‘ significant ’ statistical increase in lung cancer risk ‘ the only category of exposure that showed a trend toward increased risk was living in the same house with a smoker for 30 years or more , ’ the researchers claimed			1
while the latest study might surprise many , it is not the first research to come to the same conclusion			0
writing for @entity88 , author and journalist @entity90 pointed out that between 1959 and 1989 , two staunch anti-smoking campaigners called @entity92 and @entity93 surveyed 118,094 @entity94 in a bid to prove that smoking had damaging side effects to smokers ’ nearest and dearest			0
however , they reportedly discovered that exposure to ‘ environmental tobacco ’ or secondhand smoke , did not significantly increase a person ’s risk of lung cancer or heart disease – even if they had been exposed for long periods of time			2
the large @entity1 study of more than 76,000 women did not find a link between the disease and secondhand smoke mr @entity90 also said that the @entity116 came to a similar conclusion in 1998 after a seven - year study , as well as the @entity119 and the @entity120			1
but despite a growing body of evidence , politicians still went ahead with the smoking ban between 2006 and 2007 in the @entity125			0
epidemiologist dr @entity93 , an advisor to the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) from the @entity127 in @entity128 , said the latest study does not come as a surprise			0
he told @entity126 : ‘ the association is weak and inconsistent			0
’ ‘ we should not overstate the weak and uncertain association [ of lung cancer ] with passive smoking and should be looking for other , larger risk factors for lung cancer occurring in never smokers			2

scientists from @entity7 claim only people living with a smoker for over 30 years might be more likely to develop lung cancer
the research , which studied 76,000 women , adds to a body of evidence that argues there is no link between second - hand smoke and lung cancer
