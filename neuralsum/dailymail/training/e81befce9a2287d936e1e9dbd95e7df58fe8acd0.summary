by @entity0 for the @entity1 patients whose hearts have stopped beating will be given a dummy drug as part of a controversial @entity7 trial			2
paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water instead of the standard injection of adrenalin before carrying out @entity13 , according to a report by the @entity16 ’s @entity15			1
the trial , which will begin this @entity17 on 8,000 patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest , is aimed at assessing whether adrenalin shots actually increase survival rates			1
although it is widely used by paramedics and doctors , concerns have been raised that it has limited effect and may even cause brain damage			1
trial : paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water instead of the standard injection of adrenalin before carrying out @entity13 ( file picture ) but the study is regarded as highly controversial as patients and their relatives will not be told whether they are been given adrenalin or the placebo			1
neither will emergency crews administering the shots			2
it is being funded by the @entity46 's @entity45 and will begin this autumn in ambulance service areas in @entity48 , the @entity49 , the @entity50 , the @entity51 and @entity52			1
researchers at @entity54 who are overseeing the study said there would be local advertising campaigns in these areas telling patients how to opt out of the trial if they so wished			2
dr @entity62 , who is leading the trial said : ' we do not know that adrenalin does improve survival			1
' it is possible that it improves short - term survival but few patients leave hospital and it may be at the cost of neurological damage			0
@entity74 officers work with heart attack equipment ( file picture ) ' it may in fact be something that is custom and practice that is actually harming people			0
' there are sufficient grounds for concern that what we are doing at the moment is detrimental to people			0
' we would n't expect people would be put at unnecessary risk by this			0
' he stressed that the data would be regularly reviewed at regular intervals so that if the trial showed patients being given adrenalin were much more likely to survive it would be halted			1
around 50,000 people in @entity97 suffer a cardiac arrest outside hospital every year and only around 6 per cent survive			0
@entity101 injections have been given as part of the @entity13 process or cpr since the 1960s , but recently doubts have been raised over their effectiveness			1
research from @entity108 in 2012 on 417,000 patients found that although it initially restarted their hearts , adrenalin actually reduced their survival odds and increased the likelihood of them suffering brain damage			1
the study , published in the @entity117 , examined adrenalin use in people going into cardiac arrest before they arrived at the hospital			1
@entity122 showed that patients who were given adrenalin were less likely to survive a month , and if they were to survive , were more likely to suffer neurological problems			1
professor @entity125 , who is one of those leading the trial and specialises in @entity128 at @entity54 , said : ' the need to do this research is underpinned by a serious concern that although using adrenalin might help restart the heart in the short term , it causes severe brain damage leading to death a few hours or days later			1
' we want the best possible outcomes for all people who have a cardiac arrest , both now and in the future			0
' all patients will receive the treatment that is proven to improve survival from cardiac arrest , cpr and defibrillation			2
' @entity101 is an unproven treatment for cardiac arrest and may be harmful , which is why there is a need for this study			0
' one dilemma with the study is that relatives of patients who die may not necessarily be told that they were given a placebo drug			2
dr @entity158 , professor of @entity159 at @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , said the study was ' probably ethically justifiable – although ethically challenging because of the potential for harms to those who ca n't consent to them '			0
he said : ' i 'm not that keen on using passive means to inform relatives that their now deceased loved ones were part of a trial			0
' while there are costs and indeed risks as they note in doing this directly the risks are incurred by doing it indirectly and i think it 's a matter of respect that you inform people			0
' the @entity183 , the @entity184 , the @entity185 , the @entity186 and the @entity187 will be taking part in the trial			0
paramedics and clinicians will be blind to whether they are administering adrenalin or placebo			1
@entity194 , of the @entity183 , said : ' given the uncertainty of the evidence and the life - threatening nature of the condition being treated , it is important that we obtain the best evidence we can to provide the best treatment possible			0
' when doctors , nurses and paramedics do not know whether a treatment is effective it is common to undertake a research study			2
' we will always endeavour to act in the best interests of our patients , their safety of which is paramount			0
' the trial – which will cost more than £ 2.75 million – is expected to run until at least 2016 .			0

paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water
it will be given instead of an injection of adrenalin before cpr
trials will begin in @entity48 , the @entity49 , the @entity50
they will also be held in the @entity51 and in @entity52
