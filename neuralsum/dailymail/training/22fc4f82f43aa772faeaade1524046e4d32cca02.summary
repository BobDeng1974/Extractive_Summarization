the @entity0 will sue the state of @entity2 for alleged racial discrimination over tough new voting rules			2
this is the latest effort by the @entity7 administration to fight back against a @entity9 decision that struck down the most powerful part of the landmark @entity11 and freed southern states from strict federal oversight of their elections			1
@entity2 has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements			1
it is among at least five @entity23 states adopting stricter voter id and other election laws			1
diminishing voting rights : @entity2 and other southern states have enacted tougher new laws minorities feel target them , these protesters picketed in june against a similar law in @entity32 the @entity0 on aug. 22 sued @entity33 over the state 's voter id law and is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit over redistricting laws in @entity33 that minority groups consider to be discriminatory			1
@entity40 lawmakers in southern states insist the new measures are needed to prevent voter fraud , though such crimes are infrequent			1
democrats and civil rights groups argue the tough new laws are intended to make voting more difficult for minorities and students , voting groups that lean toward @entity45 , in states with legacies of poll taxes and literacy tests			2
attorney general @entity55 is expected to announce the lawsuit against @entity2 at a news conference monday , according to a person who has been briefed on the department 's plans but is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity			0
we 're comin ' for you : attorney general @entity55 and the @entity0 are suing southern states over their more stringent voter laws @entity55 will be joined at the news conference by the acting assistant attorney general for the @entity0 's civil rights division , @entity71 , and the three @entity73 attorneys from @entity2 , the person said			1
in the @entity2 lawsuit , the person said , the government will challenge requirements in state law that eliminate the first seven days of early voting opportunities and eliminate same - day voter registration during the early voting period			2
same - day registration allows voters to cast a ballot immediately after presenting elections officials with proof of their name and home address			0
the @entity0 challenge also is aimed at a provision eliminating the counting of certain types of provisional ballots by voters who cast ballots in their home counties but do not vote in the correct precincts			0
to the rescue : the @entity98 is spearheading the fight to defend minorities ' voting rights finally , the federal government will challenge a provision in the new law that requires voters to present government - issued identification at the polls in order to cast ballots			1
in @entity2 , a recent state board of elections survey found that hundreds of thousands of registered voters did not have a state - issued @entity112			0
many of those voters are young , black , poor or elderly			0
in remarks sept. 20 to the @entity115 , @entity55 said the @entity0 will not allow the @entity9 's action to be interpreted as " open season " for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights			1
the @entity0 will ask a federal judge to place the four provisions in @entity2 's new law under federal scrutiny for an indeterminate period - a process known as pre-clearance			2
however , the provision of the @entity11 that the @entity0 is invoking may be a difficult tool for the @entity7 administration to use			0
protect their vote : more protesters from earlier this year in @entity32 , picketing outside the @entity9 to defend the @entity11 a handful of jurisdictions have been subjected to pre-clearance , or advance approval , of election changes through the @entity138 provision it is relying on , but a court first must find that a state or local government engaged in intentional discrimination under the @entity145 's 14th or 15th amendments , or the jurisdiction has to admit to discrimination			1
unlike other parts of the voting law , the discriminatory effect of an action is not enough to trigger court review			0
nowhere is the debate over voting rights is more heated than in @entity155 , where the chaotic recount in the disputed 2000 presidential race took place			0
@entity155 election officials are set to resume an effort to remove non-citizens from the state 's voting rolls			0
a purge last year ended in embarrassment after hundreds of @entity73 citizens , most of whom were black or @entity169 , were asked to prove their citizenship or risk losing their right to vote .			0

@entity2 enacted more stringent voter id laws after a recent @entity9 decision
the nation 's *highest* court took federal oversight from the @entity11
the @entity98 is spearheading the effort to defend minorities ' voting rights in southern states
