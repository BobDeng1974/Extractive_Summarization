by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 19 september 2013 beautiful shoes are the foundation of any fashionable woman 's wardrobe , and as the editor of @entity7 , @entity5 has access to more stylish skyscraper heels than she could ever wear			2
so why , then , has the legendary fashion editor insisted on wearing the same pair of nude , pointy - toed slingbacks not just to every @entity13 show she has attended over the past few days , but almost everywhere she has been since 1994 , when they were first made - to - measure for the editor by @entity16 himself ? @entity16 showed his shoes at @entity13 for the first time this monday , when he revealed his reason for doing so : ' i wanted to get more in touch with normal people			1
' it 's shoe time ! @entity5 at the @entity24 show in @entity25 yesterday wearing a version of her favourite nude slingbacks			1
right : same shoes , same day - different dress june 1999 : an early sighting of the shoes october 2003 : @entity33 july 2004 : @entity34 fashion show april 2005 : out shopping in @entity36 september 2006 : fashion rocks concert june 2006 : at a fundraising event his shoes are not the most expensive out there , but still hover around £ 500 a pair , so the idea that he is connecting with ' normal ' is slightly moot			1
more importantly , he unveiled his shoes for next spring : they come in a riot of colours , from daffodil yellow to sugary pink , acid green and scarlet , and are adorned with tassels , bows , silver buckles , gold brocade , cream embroidery , zebra spots , florals ... all of which seemed infinitely more exciting than the nude pair , which have two intersecting straps over the front of the foot , that @entity5 seems to have had surgically attached to her tootsies			2
september 2007 : @entity67 show august 2008 : paired with a blue dress october 2009 : @entity69 august 2009 : at a film premiere so why does the fashion editor love them so much ? well , first off , these shoes are not really nude			1
they are produced expressly for @entity5 in two skin - coloured tones that perfectly suit her colouring			2
@entity16 made a last - a wooden model of @entity5 's foot - around which he sculpts her shoes , meaning each pair will fit her contours exactly			1
which means they are supremely comfy			0
a godsend , given she sometimes has to walk from limo to kerb			0
ms @entity5 takes delivery of several identical pairs each season , as she is very aware of that cardinal fashion rule : never wear a pair of shoes two days running , as they need time to breathe			0
the open toe reveals her ' meticulously groomed ' feet ( @entity16 's words , not mine )			1
like @entity100 , who for years has seemed melded to her @entity102 nude patent courts , ms @entity5 understands that nude goes with everything : jazzy prints , and every colour in the rainbow			1
nude is far more summery than black , and less severe			0
a closed shoe or , worse , an ankle strap , only serves to shorten the leg , and ms @entity5 ' has fantastic legs ' ( again , @entity113 ’s words , not mine )			0
@entity5 realises that her shoes , as she sits with her legs crossed in the front row , will appear in almost every catwalk photo for the rest of eternity , and , perhaps , ca n't be bothered to choose a fresh design for every appearance , to be picked over by people like me			0
september 2010 : with a red tweed @entity127 dress october 2010 : worn with a black coat at @entity130 awards september 2011 : @entity132 show september 2013 : @entity13 her manolos , like her glossy bob , love of fur and pastel cardis , are a trademark , a constant in an ever - changing sea of trends and mistakes and monstrosities that give you blisters			2
i applaud her , actually , opting for the boring over the barking , even as her sharp stiletto heel sank into the soggy turf at the @entity152 show on sunday afternoon			0
at least we now know that , contrary to all reports , she does n't walk on water after all ...			0
