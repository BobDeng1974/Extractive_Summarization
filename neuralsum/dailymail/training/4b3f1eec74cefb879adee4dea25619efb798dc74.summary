by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 08:33 est , 7 november 2013 a victim of an online ' rape club ' that allegedly preyed on underage girls was told by police that ' she was asking for it ' by wearing a skirt , it has been claimed			1
earlier this week police in @entity9 said two teenage boys , who called themselves the ' @entity11 ' and embarked on a campaign of luring girls into drunken group sex before boasting about their ' exploits ' on @entity16 , will not be charged			1
@entity18 police said the boys , aged 17 and 18 , would not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - had been ' brave ' enough to testify			1
' @entity21 ' : police said the boys , aged 17 and 18 , will not be prosecuted because no apparent victims - some as young as 13 - have yet been ' brave ' enough to testify but one girl , who is now 15 , has said she made a rape allegation to police two years ago and was made to reenact the alleged rape during a taped interview in front of officers			1
she says she told police that she had been raped by three boys from the @entity11 gang but they focused on why she wore a skirt when she met members of the group in 2011			1
' they said that i did n't have enough evidence to show , because i went out in clothes that was pretty much asking for it , ' said the girl , who was aged 13 at the time			1
police minister @entity44 said the case , which has sparked outrage in @entity9 , had been ' poorly handled ' and she had asked the police watchdog to conduct an inquiry			1
' i believe this is the right course of action to ensure the public has confidence in the police on this matter , ' she said after calling in police commissioner @entity55 for a briefing today			2
@entity9 prime minister @entity57 described the case as ' abhorrent ' @entity44 said the police treatment of the girl would be part of the @entity63 inquiry			1
' parents of young girls need to have confidence that complaints to police about sexual assault are investigated thoroughly and appropriately , ' she said			2
when the story broke prime minister @entity57 called the group 's alleged actions ' abhorrent ' but said it was difficult for authorities to prosecute them due to a lack of hard evidence			1
police at the time said they had been aware of the group for two years but took no action because none of its alleged victims was willing to testify against them			1
but it has since emerged that four girls complained to police as far back as 2011 , including one who made the formal statement featuring video testimony about what she allegedly endured			1
@entity57 told parliament on thursday that the performance of police was ' frankly , not good enough ' and he was disappointed ministers had learned details of the case through the media , despite requesting a full briefing			2
but he said a more important issue was that the allegations were properly followed up by police and the complainants , who were emotionally vulnerable and a potential suicide risk , were given adequate support			2
' these are fragile young girls that could potentially take their own lives , ' he said			0
' we already know that one of them has considered that			0
' victims ' rights advocates such as @entity117 mp and former sexual abuse counsellor @entity118 have said that if the claims made by @entity11 members are true then it amounts to a ' rape club ' and they should be charged accordingly			1
' grow up ! ' their actions have sparked anger across @entity126 police superintendent @entity127 said officers were reviewing evidence and hoping to speak to victims again to see if a prosecution was possible			1
' we will look at the whole evidence , at the time , to make a proper assessment , ' he told @entity135			0
@entity127 said investigators were aware ' very early on ' that one of the alleged gang members was the son of a police officer but the fact had no bearing on how the case was handled			1
detectives also confirmed that one of the boys is the son of a high - profile entertainer with ' an international profile '			2
the boys used the social networking account to post text and videos to recruit others to join their sex campaign			2
' a true roast is where you know you are going there intentionally to roast this female , ' says one in a video			1
' we do n't choose a roast , the roast chooses us			1
we have girls hitting us up to " hang out with us "			0
they know what we 're like ; they know what they 're in for			2
' a young man goes on : ' we take what we do seriously - some of you think this is a joke , it 's not			2
' you try and get with the amount of girls we do			0
this is hard , it 's a job , we do n't do this s * * * for pleasure			1
' speaking to @entity9 's 3 news on the condition of anonymity , one alleged victim described her ordeal			1
' i just kept blacking out ' cause i had drunken too much , ' she said			0
' you could say i got raped			0
i had sex with three guys at one time			0
' anger : others criticised the police for letting the boys get away with their lurid sex campaign a witness who claimed her sister was raped at one of the boys ' parties told @entity201 : ' i could name , like , literally 30 girls from all around @entity18			1
i went to one of the boys ' houses one day whose parents were away on holiday			2
and they had this room there which they called the layer			0
' they would take girls inside the layer			0
there was blood all over the walls and they would take three different girls in there at a time			0
' @entity221 said the behaviour described on the @entity16 page is rape			1
' it is not only morally reprehensible , it is criminal and illegal behaviour , ' the group said			0
the support group said the use of alcohol by offenders is often premeditated and planned			0
however , police say they can not prosecute until one of the girls comes forward			1
detective inspector @entity236 said : ' none of the girls have been brave enough to make formal statements to us so we can take it to a prosecution stage or even consider a prosecution stage			0
' he added : ' the page was left open for operational and tactical reasons , and whilst we acknowledge it was upsetting for the victims , it was being monitored for information or evidence that would assist our investigation			2
' he said the @entity253 alone does not provide evidence which would allow the case to be put before a court			0
their actions also provoked anger on @entity126			0
one tweeter wrote : ' # roastbusters grow up , get checked and have some dignity			0
little boys trying to play big games			2
' another added : ' their stupidity p * * * * s meeh off ! yes , of course you 'll be known , but for all the wrong reasons ! # @entity271 ' k here i am raging bout them lil fem % en $ , forgetting i have two exams too ! grrrr ... # @entity276			0
' a message from someone linked to the group said he made some ' major mistakes ' in a message posted on @entity126 , adding that he had made ' some dramatic changes ' to himself since appearing on the news			0
he added : ' i have not been happy with who i have become and if i suffer any consequences from my past actions then i guess i deserve it but i just want people to know i am a good person at heart and i have matured and have taken this as a massive learning experience			0
' he went on to say that he hoped no one else would go down a similar path			0
' all the girls that have been affected by this whole ridiculousness i apologise and wish the best for you			0
' but other @entity126 users were quick to call into question the sincerity of the apology			0
@entity303 posted : ' they 've been doing it for 3 years and that 's all he could come up with ? # @entity306 # @entity305			1
