@entity0 , pictured with her @entity1 , was inspired to write a fictional book based on the @entity4 and @entity6 ' dog @entity7 - published this week it is set to be the new royal bestseller ; a riproaring tale of the adventures of the @entity4 and @entity6 of @entity12 ’s @entity7			1
but behind the uplifting story of how cheeky @entity7 does battle with the @entity15 ’s corgi , @entity16 , lies a tale of personal tragedy			1
@entity0 , a former actress and model whose first book @entity22 the @entity23 : @entity24 of @entity25 is published this week , was inspired to write it following the loss of her fiance , @entity27 , a property developer who took his own life shortly before their planned wedding			1
she took long walks in @entity35 ’s parks to help her cope with the loss and it was while walking through @entity39 gardens with her own @entity7 , @entity1 , that @entity0 had the lightning idea for her book			1
‘ i ’ve always wondered what was inside those palaces and one day when we were walking , @entity45 bolted inside			2
i ran after her and two lovely guards came out with her			2
she looked very pleased with herself , ’ she said			2
‘ the royal family inhabits a ‘ secret ’ behind - closed - doors world we never really get to see			1
i started to think about life as a royal pup , with palaces and parks at your disposal			2
i saw the scope for mystery and adventure - secret passageways , tunnels and portals to other times			1
‘ a terrific picture implanted itself in my mind of the royal couple walking down a beach and @entity7 running in the wash and he just looked like this incredibly happy , fun dog and all those things just came together in that moment of @entity1 running around in the palace gardens			1
’ @entity6 received the dog as an early @entity73 present from her parents in 2011 after he was bred from their family dog , @entity77			1
@entity78 now plans a series of adventures for @entity7 after @entity81 , signed her up in a four book deal and described the series as a ‘ @entity84 for today ’s readers ’			1
negotiations are already under way for the film rights and @entity90 rights			2
@entity0 , 37 , credits her dog @entity45 , for the idea , but she also says she was inspired to complete the book by her own personal tragedy			1
in 2008 her fiancée , @entity27 shot himself just five weeks before their wedding amid the collapse of his business empire			2
he was 36 and had been suffering from depression			2
@entity0 says : ‘ suicide is like a bomb exploding			1
because the person who dies leaves injured people all around them , suffering incredible pain and grief			0
‘ you naturally look for someone to blame			0
mentally i accused every - one - creditors , @entity27 ’s friends , even my own family - for not supporting us both more			2
i was tortured about why i had n’t seen that he was in such a state of emotional crisis			0
’ the @entity4 and @entity118 pictured with son @entity119 and their @entity7 in 2013 @entity7 was given to the @entity6 as an early @entity73 present from her parents in 2011 - he features in this portrait with the royal couple and their son @entity119 at @entity39 in march 2014 it was @entity45 who comforted @entity0 through the bleak tragedy			1
after @entity27 ’s death , @entity0 decided a puppy would help soothe her grief			1
it seemed portentous that the cocker spaniel was born the day before the funeral			0
‘ it was a beacon of hope , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ the minute i got her she was the strangest thing			0
when i first took her home i put her on my lap and she put both her paws on my shoulders			0
dogs are incredible for depression they really pep you up and in grief she really gave me a reason to keep trudging forward			0
. ‘ she pretty much saved my life			0
i just remember thinking that night how lucky i was to have this little beacon of hope , because i had to take care of it			0
i could n’t just wilt away , which is what i wanted to do			0
i had to get out of bed and walk it , feed it , take care of it and keep going			0
the @entity22 the @entity23 : the secret of @entity25 by @entity0 is published this week ‘ she really pulled me through			1
otherwise i think i would have just crumbled			0
she is still keeping me going			0
without @entity1 i do n’t think i would have made it , in some very dark and sad times she was amazing			1
’ the death of her fiance came as a particular blow to @entity165 because her mother @entity167 , a successful model and actress in the 1960s , died of leukaemia when @entity0 was just 14			1
@entity0 says : ‘ she was very sick			1
i did n’t really know what it was , and she did n’t really want us to know about it			0
she was determined to beat it			0
she fought very hard for a very long time , had endless rounds of chemotherapy			0
can you imagine being this beautiful woman , come out of a divorce , want to build this wonderful future and it just went horribly wrong			0
‘ she did everything she could to fight it , she set up a charity called the @entity186 , she loved children , loved babies			2
@entity189 , became a huge source of support to the charity which meant a lot to my mother			2
she was very very helpful and once told me : ' your mother is an incredible woman , she is so courageous , do n’t ever forget that ”			0
’ after her mother ’s death in 1991 @entity0 and her younger brother , @entity196 , went to live with their father			1
he later married a woman with royal connections			0
‘ my stepmother @entity204 , has judged horses all over the world , and she ’s an incredible woman			0
she worked with @entity207 and @entity208			0
she and my dad hosted hunt balls at our house in @entity213			0
’ inspired by @entity214 ’s , @entity215 , she started scribbling fantasy and adventure stories as a schoolgirl - despite being diagnosed as dyslexic			1
so when she came up with the idea of the adventures of @entity7 , she knew she owed it to herself to see the project through			1
‘ i sat down to write and it was amazing how quickly it tumbled out , it was like i was destined to do it			2
during a tour of @entity25 it just all came together			0
i could feel it and the whole story just mapped out in seconds and it took just a couple of days to write ; then a year to perfect it			2
’ @entity0 says she was inspired to write the book after the death of her fiance just weeks before her wedding she came up with the idea for the book when her own @entity1 bolted into @entity39 whilst out on a walk			1
it was @entity45 who comforted @entity0 through the bleak tragedy of her partner @entity27 's death in the first story @entity7 is out for a walk with @entity246 and @entity119 in @entity247 when accused of a serious crime he did not commit - an attack on a swan , which are protected under the @entity15 ’s charter			1
in his efforts to prove his innocence , he crosses paths with a villainous corgi called @entity16			0
although several members of the @entity258 appear in the books , the focus is on the animals and their adventures			0
‘ it ’s not about the royal family as such , they are only mentioned fleetingly , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i actually think the animals are far more interesting			0
but at the heart of these stories is the loyal bond between @entity7 and the baby prince			1
i hope when he ’s older his parents will read the books to him			2
’ ‘ @entity7 and the @entity272 ’ out on 4 september ( @entity81 ) www.theadventuresoflupo.com			1
