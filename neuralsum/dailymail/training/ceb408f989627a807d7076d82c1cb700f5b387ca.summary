@entity0 failed miserably to put pressure on @entity3 leaders @entity4 as they were held to a 1 - 1 draw against @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 missed great chances for the @entity11 in an otherwise limp first - half which ended with the home side being booed off			2
@entity15 's side continued to struggle after the break but it looked like they would escape with three points when skipper @entity19 scored in the 78th minute following a @entity21 corner			1
rangers were boosted with the inclusion of @entity21 who broke off from @entity37 duty to take his place in the @entity39 midfield			0
the 20 - year - old was called up for the first time to the senior squad by @entity43 for the @entity3 qualifying clash with @entity45 at @entity46 on friday night and the friendly against @entity48 at the same venue			2
@entity43 did not involve @entity21 in the 1 - 0 win over the @entity51 allowing him to play against the @entity52 but he was as uninspiring as his team mates in the dreadfully dull early stages			0
midfielder @entity55 did have the ball in the net after six minutes but looked up to see the flag being waved for offside			0
fellow midfielder @entity60 found himself in referee @entity62 's book two minutes later for a foul on @entity64 on the halfway line			0
@entity55 ( left ) had a goal ruled out for offside as well as a missed chance in the final minutes the @entity6 team go to applaud their fans after holding on for a draw against @entity0 @entity6 manager @entity72 ( above ) was certainly the happier of the two managers after the game @entity15 was raging when the official then allowed @entity6 's @entity76 to boot the ball away after conceding a free - kick without taking any action			1
in between those two incidents , @entity80 forced @entity0 keeper @entity82 into a decent save at the expense of a fruitless corner after he was allowed to run 40 yards before despatching his shot from the edge of the box			2
the home side could not get going			0
in the 17th minute , however , @entity8 should have opened the scoring when a law through ball landed at his feet 14 yards from goal but the @entity7 striker blasted his shot straight at @entity6 keeper @entity95			2
just after the half - hour mark , following good work by @entity21 in midfield , @entity9 missed a sitter when he headed @entity101 's cross on the run from the right past the post from the centre of the goals			1
moments later , @entity82 was called into action again to divert @entity109 's 25 - yard shot round the post , and the half - time whistle allowed the home fans the chance to vent some pent - up frustration			1
@entity15 's side started the second - half with more of a tempo , @entity8 diverting a driven cross from @entity21 past the post with his head before the young playmaker drew a good save from @entity95 with a drive from outside the penalty area			0
law ( right ) of @entity0 clashes with @entity64 ( left ) of @entity6 before the referee intervenes @entity0 supporters booed the team off at half - time with the score 0 - 0 and were not happier at end of the game however , the home side soon regressed and in the 59th minute @entity15 replaced the ineffective @entity8 with @entity51 striker @entity130 before the injured @entity101 made way for @entity132			1
there was little improvement but growing disgruntlement from the home fans was put aside when , from @entity21 's corner , the ball landed at @entity19 who hooked it into the net from eight yards			0
instead of kicking on , though , @entity0 found themselves pegged back six minutes later when @entity82 parried a drive from @entity109 out to @entity25 who lashed it high into the net from close range			1
@entity145 was immediately brought on for @entity9 with @entity15 's last throw of the dice but although there was the expected late flurry , with @entity132 firing over in stoppage time from close range , there was to be no late goal to prevent the home side being jeered at the final whistle .			0

@entity0 booed off at half - time with the scores *goalless*
@entity19 scored in the 78th minute to give @entity0 the lead
but @entity25 levelled six minutes later to earn @entity6 a point
