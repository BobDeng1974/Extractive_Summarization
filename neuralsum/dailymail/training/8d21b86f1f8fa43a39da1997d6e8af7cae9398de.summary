by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 3 march 2013 in july 2009 , my husband took me to @entity3 , the scene of many of his youthful triumphs			2
we enjoyed a long , hot sunny day sipping @entity8 ’s			2
it was bliss , not least because since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis the summer before , i had become increasingly anxious about outings to beaches or markets , or even parties and weddings			2
for years , i ’d been suffering increasing tingling and numbness in my limbs that became impossible to ignore			2
a clicking hip while pregnant with my youngest son – now seven – was followed by weakness in my leg , numbness in both feet , night cramps and weak bladder control			2
after myriad appointments , tests and mri scans , i received my diagnosis : primary progressive multiple sclerosis			2
but like all variations of @entity39 , in which the immune system turns inward and attacks the nervous system causing a raft of worsening symptoms , there is no cure			1
you are on your own			2
anything involving walking and standing became difficult			2
but then came salvation : a little - known treatment which i had been taking for just a month at that point called @entity34 ( @entity34 )			1
i found , like thousands of other @entity55 @entity39 patients , that it vastly improved my symptoms			1
yet , incredibly , @entity34 – traditionally used as a way to treat heroin addiction – has not been licensed for use in @entity39 , so must be bought privately			1
and the majority of mainstream doctors dispute it is of any use , so trials are unlikely			0
i am an @entity65 - educated 50 - year - old woman and like any intelligent person i read about any new drug trumpeted as a miracle cure in the press , where there is the odd flash of hope			1
sadly , i have become used to taking the news of breakthroughs with a hefty dose of cynicism			0
any innovation takes an age to reach the market and waiting for drugs to be assessed means patients are left despairing			0
private help : @entity34 costs £ 300 a year - just 82p a day - but is not available on the @entity83 as it has not been trialled to combat @entity39 i wrote about my condition and its impact on a busy mother of three boys in this newspaper early in 2009			1
i received a slew of emails from readers , particularly fellow sufferers of @entity39 , who urged me – in sensible , enthusiastic and articulate ways – to try @entity34			1
it is a class of drug known as an opioid antagonist and works by inhibiting natural feel - good chemicals called endorphins , thus forcing the body to produce more			1
in turn this reduces painful symptoms and increases a sense of well - being			0
it is given to drug addicts in a dose of 50mg , but since 1985 in the @entity108 it has been used by a growing minority of innovative doctors in much smaller doses of 3mg to 4.5mg daily for the treatment of autoimmune disease			1
happy pills : @entity34 is an opioid antagonist and forces the body to produce endorphins when i asked , my gp maintained – and still does – that the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of @entity34 was weak			1
my neurologist feels the same , and says he would not support its use without further clinical data			0
but other medics feel differently			0
do n’t forget that the drug is available on the @entity83 already , just for different conditions			1
‘ @entity131 have given written approval of its use on the @entity83 , yet so many gps and neurologists still refuse to prescribe it , ’ says dr @entity128 , who is listed on the @entity130 website			1
he has a personal history of @entity39 and has prescribed @entity34 since 2000 , crediting the resolving of his medical problem to the drug			1
‘ at less than £ 300 a year – about 82p a day – the cost is minimal compared with , for example , beta interferon , another drug for @entity39 which costs between £ 9,000 and £ 12,000 a year , ’ he says			1
‘ the reason no one prescribes it is because it has n’t been trialled			2
’ i understand the refusal to prescribe new drugs without scientific basis but all i was left with was an airy suggestion to take extra @entity151 so i bought @entity34 through a website recommended by the @entity153			1
it asked for written confirmation from my doctor of my diagnosis , and i took my first dose in bitter - tasting liquid form in july 2009			0
what did i have to lose ? i did n’t notice any immediate difference to my left leg , but at least the day was not punctuated by frequent dashes to the loo			0
the next morning i realised i had slept better than usual because i had n’t been up during the night			0
walking to work the following week my leg had stopped dragging as it had been doing			0
the effects were minor , but noticeable , both physically and mentally			0
so i have continued to take @entity34			1
it feels positive to be taking something hopeful			0
@entity34 is n’t a miracle cure , and it ’s not held up as one			1
now my left leg is weaker			0
i ca n’t walk as far without getting tired			0
but , almost four years since i started taking it , it has n’t got worse			0
apart from a yearly check - up with my neurologist , i do n’t think about my condition			0
i still limp but the rest of my life – my sons , a husband , part - time work , holidays – continues			0
what is so galling is that @entity34 supporters are forced to come across as evangelical nutters			1
whatever happened to patient choice ? ldnresearchtrust.org ; @entity186			0

@entity34 ( @entity34 ) costs £ 300 a year privately
drug is not available on the @entity83 as it has not been trialled to combat @entity39
