asked in an interview with @entity2 before the @entity3 to name his favourite @entity5 defenders , @entity0 struggled initially , and then came up with the names of @entity7 and @entity8			1
remembering the hat - trick he scored against @entity8 in the 2012 @entity10 should send a shudder through the ranks of the @entity14 's other defenders – if this is what he does against someone he rates , then what will he do to the rest ? @entity20 have acquired the services of the man @entity22 called the world 's best no 9 when he coached him at @entity25			1
he got the winner for @entity43 against @entity44 in 2011 's @entity46 final and scored twice against @entity47 to retain the title			1
then came that @entity50 demolition			0
at best , @entity20 will only be playing one final ( the @entity52 ) this year but they have acquired the services of a man who has played in three since 2011 , scoring six goals and always ending up on the winning side			1
the son of @entity58 , a rugged centre back who played most of his career in @entity62 , @entity0 was named after @entity63 , @entity65 's no 15 in their 1982 @entity3 dream team			1
goal - getter : @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity68 on one of his first appearances for the club in pre-season prolific : @entity0 wheels away after netting for @entity43 against rivals @entity44 in the 2011 @entity46 final he soon showed himself to be worthy of the name with goals that earned him a move to @entity79 aged just 15			1
' he was like a rock , ' said former @entity82 defender @entity81 , impressed at the unflustered nature of the new arrival he tried to intimidate on his first day			0
@entity0 was already showing a resilience of character that would serve him well in the 27 - dorm block of youth team accommodation alongside @entity79 's @entity89 , where he boarded a long way from his family in @entity92			2
in 2001 , @entity94 's under - 16s went to @entity95 to play in a 32 - team tournament and he was all that anyone could talk about , shooting @entity94 into the semi-finals where he scored in the last minute against @entity99 and then headed his team in front against @entity102 in the final only to lose out 2 - 1			0
injuries slowed his progress and one torn ankle ligament kept him out for eight months			0
he kept the faith through the long period of inactivity and ' keeping the faith ' in @entity0 's case can be taken literally			0
deadly : @entity0 celebratesscoring in the 2012 @entity10 against @entity50 ( left ) and scores against @entity47 in the 2012 @entity46 final in @entity114 he can be seen dedicating goals and trophies to the heavens as a teenage prodigy			2
this is a player who has not ruled out working for the church when he retires			1
the faith was tested again when he tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee in 2006 but again he showed that iron will to come back just as strong			0
he scored a hat - trick against @entity127 in the @entity128 in 2007 when his team were 2 - 1 down , playing with 10 men , and needing to win by two clear goals			2
the feat is still referred to as the ' @entity134 ' by fans who celebrated a title a year later with @entity0 top scorer and @entity22 as manager			2
after 72 goals in two seasons at @entity43 he moved to @entity25 where he linked up again with @entity22			1
the coach instructed his new players that tactics would revolve around @entity0 – their passes would find him , and he would do the rest			0
@entity147 blow : @entity0 sits next to @entity92 coach @entity149 as he is ruled out the @entity3 in june two years older with another cruciate ligament injury , this time in the left knee , and a sabbatical in @entity68 behind him , it remains to be seen whether @entity0 is the same player that scored 52 goals in 67 games in @entity157			1
the desire from the player is definitely there			0
' i like how competitive the @entity14 is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition 's goal , ' he said at the end of last season			0
' i want to play in the @entity5 league			0

@entity0 joined @entity20 on loan on *transfer* deadline day
the *striker* has spoken of his desire to succeed in the @entity14
he has a prolific scoring record at @entity43 , @entity25 and @entity68
@entity0 has also scored six goals in just three @entity181 finals
the 28 - year - old has always come back strongly from serious injuries
he has not ruled out working for the church when he retires
