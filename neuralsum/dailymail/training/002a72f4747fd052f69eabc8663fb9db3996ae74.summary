by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 golf is not usually regarded as an extreme sport but @entity5 's @entity4 was given the scare of his life on the course in @entity9 on friday			1
@entity4 was playing the 14th hole of his second round at the @entity12 when he was suddenly attacked by a swarm of giant hornets			1
the 30 - year - old from @entity16 was forced to flee from the angry swarm and , after failing to escape his attackers , dived into a lake and took cover under water in a desperate bid to shake off the insects , which he described as ' three times the size of bees '			1
@entity4 eventually emerged from the lake , dried off and received several injections to treat the 20 stings he suffered			1
incredibly , @entity4 then resumed his round and he shot a remarkable score of 68 - four under par - which included two birdies after the terrifying incident			1
' i hit my tee shot just right of the bunker and chipped it out quite well , ' @entity4 said of the incident , which occurred on the fifth hole at @entity54 and @entity55			1
' so i 'm walking along and suddenly i felt something on my nose			0
i swatted it away and suddenly ... they were not bees , they were three times the size of bees			0
evasive action : @entity4 attempts to waft away the angry hornets after they attacked on the fifth hole @entity67 : the @entity69 star was unable to shake off his attackers despite his vigorous attempts back off : @entity4 ditched his shirt and jumped into the lake on the advice of other players ' they were huge and like 30 or 40 of them started to attack me big time			1
i did n't know what to do			0
my caddie told me to run , so i start running like a crazy guy , but the hornets were still there , so the other players told me to jump in the lake			1
' so i ran to the lake , threw my scorecard down , took off my shoes and jumped into the lake			1
it was the scariest moment of my career , for sure			0
i 've never been so scared			0
' i had to throw my shirt and hat away , and the towel i 'd been swatting them with			0
the referees and a doctor took me aside and gave me a couple of injections and told me to relax			0
after the injections i felt a lot better and could continue			0
without the help of the referees i could n't have finished the round , because i was in no state to play golf			2
happier times : @entity4 in more regular action on friday at @entity107 no slouch : @entity4 beat @entity109 to win the @entity110 in january another dive : @entity4 took the plunge into the water after winning the @entity114 in 2008 ' tomorrow it will be very , very scary to play that hole			2
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do , but hopefully i will play it as quickly as i can			0
' @entity4 , who won the @entity110 ahead of @entity109 and @entity119 in january , later added on @entity120 : ' in my room resting after a long and tough day out there ... @entity123 still in pain but i will be 100 per cent and ready tomorrow to go for a low one ... ' there are a lot of stories around the golf courses around the world but looks like i always have the crazy ones			2
maybe i start to write a book			0
' @entity133 took command of the tournament on friday after adding a 66 to his opening 65 for a 13 - under - par halfway total of 131 , four shots ahead of @entity140 team - mate @entity139 and @entity141 of the @entity142			2
in the swing : @entity144 's @entity133 is the tournament leader at the halfway stage fairway to heaven : @entity149 's @entity148 plays a shot on the picturesque course in @entity9 but the 40 - year - old 's superb performance was somewhat overshadowed by the bizarre incident involving @entity4			1
@entity4 is 11 shots behind the @entity144 and needs a miracle comeback to somehow claim glory this week			2
after this ordeal , that really would provide a sting in the tale .			0

@entity4 was attacked during second round of @entity12
@entity5 player jumped into lake to escape on advice of other players
@entity69 star suffered 20 stings during terrifying ordeal
but he played on and shot four under par score at @entity177
