administrators at a @entity2 university in @entity3 agreed to help an honors student start a campus club that would send money and supplies to the @entity9 terror army			1
hidden camera footage released monday morning shows officials and faculty at @entity13 advising a senior – identified only as ' @entity15 ' – about the best way to secure funding for a club she called ' @entity20 of the @entity9			1
' ' i want to start fundraising efforts on campus , and what i want to do is raise funds to send overseas , ' she told @entity27 , the school 's coordinator for @entity29 and student organizations			1
@entity27 offered to help her create the organization and agreed with her request to ' pass out @entity9 state flags and educate people ' at an annual student ' @entity37 ' fair			1
the video is from @entity39 , a conservative ' guerilla film - making group ' that last week captured a @entity43 dean agreeing that @entity9 and @entity44 would be welcome at the @entity46 school			1
it also once received tuition money from retired @entity81 great @entity80 , who graduated in 2012 with a doctorate in @entity83			0
his final ' capstone project ' – a load - lightened version of a doctoral dissertation – focused on ' humor and seriousness in leadership styles , ' according to the @entity90			0
the school 's mission statement says ' all members of our community ' must ' accept social responsibility to foster peace and nonviolence			0
' yet @entity27 was enthusiastic about @entity15 's terror - funding venture			0
' we 're not here to limit people and their clubs , he said			1
' if there a demand or a need , or an interest that students have to do this , we 're here to support that			2
' ' if you 've got ... people who are interested , and this is something you want take and run with , ' he added			2
' we 're here to help you get that done			0
' ' @entity117 ' : @entity27 explained that his office would n't make judgments about the kinds of activities and clubs college students wanted to sign up for the only objection ? asking students to support a group with ' @entity9 ' in its name , a multicultural program coordinator thought , might hold the organization back – so why not rename it ? @entity15 put the murderous @entity9 army 's credentials front - and - center			1
' they are terrorists , ' she told @entity27 , ' but , like , we 're trying to help them			1
we 're trying to , like , educate them and give them funding so that they do n't have to be impoverished and get involved in acts of violence			1
' ' you should create jobs and help promote education in the @entity64 , ' she added later , ' because that 's what helps reduce terrorism			2
' that was a subtle jab at @entity149 deputy spokeswoman @entity148 , who said last month on @entity150 that ' we can not kill our way out of this war ' with @entity9			2
' the @entity155 administration , @entity148 said , should instead ' go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups ' – including ' lack of opportunity for jobs			0
' at one point @entity15 expanded her fictional club 's mandate to include providing paper and pencils to the ' widows and orphans ' of dead @entity9 jihadis			2
@entity13 is a @entity2 institution founded in 1940 ; its enrollment includes more than 9,000 students , about half of whom are undergrads like @entity15 @entity175 : @entity13 administrators @entity27 ( left ) and @entity176 ( center ) , and professor @entity178 , helpfully counseled an undercover investigator about how to start a @entity181 student club fly the flag : @entity15 was told her fictional @entity181 group would be allowed to pass out @entity9 flags and ' educate ' people during a campus ' @entity188 ' event @entity189 : @entity80 earned an @entity83 doctorate in 2012 another part of her pitch to college officials was a mission that included providing flashlights to @entity9 fighters and their families			1
' a lot of the facilities have been destroyed ' in @entity201 and @entity202 , she said , ' so there is not a lot of electricity and power			2
' ' a lot of the fighters , they ca n't see at night , you know ? ' she continued			0
' so , like , people are attacking them and they ca n't see at night			0
and because they are so poor , like , they do n't have night vision and stuff			0
' @entity27 explored the idea , speculating about the ' thousands of dollars ' it might cost to send ' bulk shipments ' of flashlights to the @entity221 , ' like the ones at @entity223 and stuff			0
' the only objection @entity15 encountered was related to the group 's proposed name			0
' the only thing , as far as the name [ goes ] , ' she heard from @entity230 , the university 's associate director of international and multicultural programs , is that ' technically our country is at war with @entity9 '			2
@entity230 was quick to add : ' i am not saying that – at all – @entity9 represents @entity237			2
' but students might have ' some reservation ' supporting a group engaged in a ' humanitarian effort ' aimed at the terror group , she said			0
' it 's just unfortunate			0
' another multicultural program administrator , @entity246 , chimed in that @entity15 should rename her group ' students in @entity249 ' – ' as opposed to having the ' @entity9 ' [ name ]			1
' @entity39 has already stung a @entity43 dean who said on camera that the @entity46 school would welcome an @entity9 ' freedom fighter ' who wanted to run a training camp jobs for @entity256 ? @entity149 deputy spokeswoman @entity148 insisted in february on @entity150 that an employment program in the @entity201 and @entity202 could stem the tide of @entity9 a professor who runs the university 's honors program later agreed to serve as the @entity181 club 's faculty advisor			1
@entity15 explained that despite a less focused name that did n't include any mention of terror groups , her organization 's mission would remain ' raising money and sending it to the @entity64			2
' professor @entity178 responded : ' i 'll sign			0
i 'm glad to do it			0
' @entity15 , an email from a @entity13 administrator confirms , is set to receive an award on monday from the school , as the ' outstanding senior in the @entity278			1
' in december the @entity279 , a federal government agency , named @entity13 to the president 's @entity280			0
the distinction acknowledges universities that place a premium on community service efforts			0
@entity286 has contacted the university staff named in the video and has not received a comment from them			1
in a statement provided to @entity286 by the university , @entity291 , vice president for student affairs , said , ' there has been no formation of an @entity9 - related humanitarian aid group at @entity13 ' and that ' no paperwork ' has ' ever ' been filed to create such an organization			1
' if a student or students are interested in forming a recognized student organization , they are advised on the established processes to follow for approval , ' @entity291 stated			0
' however , submitting a request does not guarantee approval since the purpose of all student groups must be in accordance with @entity13 ’s @entity311 and @entity312			1
' @entity13 would not approve any group supporting a terrorist organization			1

honors student set to receive communications award at @entity13 in @entity72 told college officials she wanted to start a club to support @entity9
student organizations chief told her she could get funding for group called ' @entity20 of the @entity9 and @entity202 '
' they are terrorists , ' she told him , ' but we 're trying to help them , we 're trying to educate them and give them funding '
' we 're not here to limit people , ' the university administrator replied , and agreed with her request to ' pass out @entity64 flags ' at a school event
the *vp* for student affairs told @entity286 , ' @entity13 would not approve any group supporting a terrorist organization '
@entity39 , a conservative group run by guerilla *filmmaker* @entity39 , made the startling video
group *previously* filmed a @entity43 dean saying an @entity9 ' freedom fighter ' could host a training camp at the @entity46 school
