the history of @entity1 is littered with dramatic last - day title shootouts in which legends such as @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have put everything on the line ... and all without the need to award double points			1
ahead of sunday ’s showdown we look at @entity13 ’s most thrilling finales			1
1950 — @entity14 , @entity15 the first @entity1 season came down to a fight between the three @entity18 of @entity19 : @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity20 , with his straight - arm driving style , led but was being harried by @entity21 until his gearbox broke			1
@entity21 rejoined the race in his team - mate @entity27 ’s car but was hampered by further gremlins			1
with @entity31 way back in third , @entity20 , a qualified doctor and cavalry officer , won to become @entity1 ’s first champion			1
@entity33 ( pictured ) won in 1950 to become @entity1 's first ever champion 1959 — @entity35 , @entity36 @entity37 led the table coming into the final race but @entity40 , also in a @entity41 , was just 5.5 points behind after winning the previous two grands prix			1
@entity45 ’s @entity44 was also in contention			2
@entity40 , who had taken pole , retired with a broken gearbox			2
@entity44 was bumped on the first lap and took a long pit stop			1
it was all clear for @entity37 to win the race and the title			2
but he ran out of fuel			2
he got out and pushed the car over the line for fourth			1
it was enough for the championship , too			2
@entity37 pushed his car over the line to win the @entity61 in 1959 1964 — @entity62 , @entity63 @entity64 became the only man to win a world championship on two and four wheels			1
his rivals were @entity69 , who headed the standings , and @entity71 , who needed to win the race			2
@entity69 was running third , enough for the title , but he collided with @entity74 and his hopes were dashed			2
@entity71 , who started on pole , was driving brilliantly at the front only for his lotus to start leaking oil , eventually forcing him to stop			2
@entity74 let his @entity45 team - mate @entity64 through for second — and history			1
@entity64 is still the only man to have won a world championship on both two and four wheels 1976 — @entity82 , @entity83 ‘ by all the laws of humanity , ’ wrote @entity4 on the front page of the following day ’s @entity85 , ‘ i should not be motor racing champion of the world			2
’ it had been an insane climax to an insane season			0
@entity45 ’s @entity3 had almost burned to death at the @entity94 , allowing @entity4 to narrow the gap during the @entity97 ’s recuperation			0
it came down to @entity82			0
the weather was so bad that @entity3 retired after one lap. @entity4 carried on , took third and the title			0
@entity4 ( left ) was involved in a tense battle for the 1976 championship with rival @entity3 ( right ) 1984 — @entity105 , @entity106 the closest race ever in numerical terms , @entity3 beating @entity110 team - mate @entity109 by half a point			1
@entity109 won the race , equalling @entity71 ’s record of seven wins in a season ( although when the championship started in 1950 there were just six grands prix in @entity120 as well as the @entity122 race )			0
but @entity3 , helped by @entity123 spinning off , came second and that was enough for his third and final title			0
@entity3 celebrates after winning the @entity127 @entity126 at @entity128 in july , 1984 1986 — @entity129 , @entity130 all seemed under control for @entity123 — he was in third place , enough to beat his title rivals @entity133 and @entity109			0
but on lap 64 at @entity136 his tyre blew violently			0
‘ look at that , ’ exclaimed @entity137 on the @entity138			0
@entity123 somehow kept his @entity140 out of the wall but his race was over			0
@entity109 became world champion but @entity123 consoled himself with becoming ‘ @entity144 ’ and @entity145			0
left to right : @entity146 , @entity109 , @entity123 and @entity133 pose for the cameras in 1986 1994 — @entity129 a bitter day that , rightly or wrongly , shaped the reputation of @entity5 as a dirty fighter			1
the @entity151 , who started the race one point ahead of @entity155 , hit the wall in his @entity157			0
this allowed @entity69 to get alongside @entity5 , who then turned his car in on the @entity127 favourite			1
both men were out of the race , making @entity5 champion			1
@entity5 celebrates with his team manager @entity164 after winning the 1994 championship 1997 — @entity166 , @entity167 @entity5 was again cast as villain			1
he turned in on @entity169 at @entity171 corner , but this time it did not work for him			0
@entity5 ended up beached in the gravel , @entity169 survived and took third and the title			1
@entity5 was disqualified from the championship and admitted he regretted the incident — a rare mea culpa			1
@entity178 driver @entity169 gets out of his @entity140 - @entity13 car at the @entity166 circuit in @entity167 in 1997 2008 — @entity181 , @entity182 perhaps the most dramatic final day of all			1
in spitting rain , @entity184 of @entity45 crossed the line first			1
@entity187 needed to finish fifth or better to win the title but the @entity189 was sixth as @entity184 won			0
but in the next few seconds , @entity187 passed @entity191 ’s @entity190 , who was struggling on slick tyres on the wet track			0
news of @entity187 ’s late surge was relayed to the @entity184 family , who were already celebrating in the @entity45 garage			0
@entity187 won the title and @entity184 , in front of his home support , conducted himself graciously in numbing defeat			0
@entity187 celebrates in @entity181 in 2008 , after winning the @entity182 @entity126 at @entity204 2012 — @entity181 poor @entity205 , who lost out on the title on the final day of the season for the third time			0
the hero of the day was @entity211			0
the left side of his @entity213 was severely bruised in a collision with @entity215 on the fourth corner of the race			0
@entity45 ’s @entity205 , trailing by 13 points at the start , finished second			0
@entity211 , in a superior car , fought back doggedly to sixth			1
it was enough for his third title at the young age of 25			0
@entity211 won his third @entity226 's championship in a row at @entity181 in 2012			2
