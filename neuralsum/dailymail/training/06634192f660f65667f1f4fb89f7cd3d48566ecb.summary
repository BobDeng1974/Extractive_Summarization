mr @entity57 was told : ‘ no pressure was applied to drop this investigation			2
to suggest otherwise is to risk impugning the professional reputation and integrity of a number of journalists			0
’ the email referred mr @entity57 to a blog written by @entity77 editor @entity88 explaining the decision not to broadcast claims against @entity26			0

he told @entity152 : ‘ i would be delighted if there did n’t have to be , but not surprised if there did			0
‘ we have to find out who made mistakes , where those mistakes were made and what the consequences of those mistakes were			0
' it seems difficult to believe there were n’t any mistakes and those have consequences			0
’ he admitted that he and the @entity2 had misled the public because of mr @entity88 ’s inaccurate claims about why a report on @entity26 ’s predatory activities was shelved in 2011 , shortly after the former @entity174 presenter ’s death			2
@entity6 added : ‘ the @entity2 has n’t done as well as we should have done , to put it mildly , and that is an issue we will have to address in the aftermath of this			2
