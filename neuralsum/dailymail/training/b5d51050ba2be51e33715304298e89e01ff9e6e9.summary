by @entity0 it ’s not often little @entity2 send tremors across the world football - but that ’s exactly what they did in march when the part - timers from @entity10 football ’s lowest tier were just 12 minutes from eliminating @entity11 in a @entity13 quarter - final at @entity14			1
there was a similar , if not so well publicised , aftershock earlier this month when the @entity18 club announced they had sacked the manager responsible for their best run in the tournament since 1936			0
not only was @entity22 brutally binned despite steering the club to its biggest - ever payday – earning £ 400,000 before losing to @entity11 in a replay – his bulleting came just weeks after he had penned a new one - year contract and signed 15 new players for the new season			1

on the back of @entity22 ’s achievements , @entity2 had garnered bucket - loads of positive publicity on their way to the last - eight , especially after donating £ 10,000 of their cup cash to a children ’s charity			1
his abrupt departure shone a less favourable spotlight on the uncharacteristic ruthlessness of @entity2 , as @entity22 bemoaned his ‘ shock ’ and ‘ surprise ’ at being shown the door after a run that also saw @entity53 eliminated			2
on tuesday , however , as new boss @entity35 was officially paraded , the impressively plain - speaking @entity2 chairman @entity56 set the record straight in pretty damning fashion			0
for all the plaudits that accompanied their best cup run in 78 years , last season ’s seventh place finish in @entity61 was deemed ‘ unacceptable ’			2
the team ’s end - of - season performances , after @entity22 had signed his new deal , were deemed as particularly unappetising			0
