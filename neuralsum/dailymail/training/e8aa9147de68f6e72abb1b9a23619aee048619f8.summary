by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 11:36 est , 29 january 2014 a couple have defied all the odds to become parents to two daughters			0
@entity6 and @entity7 have two children thanks to @entity10 treatment , but having children nearly cost mrs @entity12 her life			1
mrs @entity12 had two rounds of @entity10 in 2008 the first of which failed and the second resulted in an ectopic pregnancy			1
@entity6 and @entity7 endured six rounds of @entity10 to have their two daughters - @entity21 ( right ) and @entity22 ( left ) she had to have her fallopian tubes removed following the ectopic pregnancy			1
in 2009 mrs @entity12 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , conceived again after more ivf but the pregnancy proved difficult			1
despite having had her fallopian tubes removed , mrs @entity12 was convinced she was suffering a second ectopic pregnancy			1
‘ i asked “ what ’s the chance of it happening again ? ” ’ said mr @entity7 , 31 , a support worker			0
‘ we were told there was more chance of winning the lottery three times in a week			0
’ mrs @entity12 , 33 , was pregnant with twins but unbeknown to medical staff , one of the embryos was growing in the scar tissue of one of the removed fallopian tubes			1
before @entity21 was conceived , mrs @entity12 had a failed cycle of @entity10 and another that resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - this meant she had to have her fallopian tubes removed ‘ deep down i knew i was having an ectopic pregnancy , ’ said mrs @entity12			1
it is known that the chance of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly higher after @entity10 treatment than after a natural conception			1
she was admitted to @entity53 when she was nine weeks pregnant and started to suffer intense pain			0
an ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside the womb , usually in one of the fallopian tubes			1
this means the egg will not develop into a baby			0
most women suffering an ectopic pregnancy start to show symptoms between week five and week 14 of the pregnancy			2
these symptoms can include abnormal bleeding and abdominal pain			0
if the ectopic pregnancy is detected at an early stage , the pregnancy can be terminated using medication			2
if it is detected at a more advanced stage , surgery may be required to remove the egg			0
without treatment , there is a risk that the egg could continue to grow and cause the fallopian tube to rupture			2
this can cause life - threatening internal bleeding			1
signs of a ruptured fallopian tube are a sudden pain , feeling faint , feeling or being sick and shoulder pain			2
about one in 90 pregnancies in the @entity88 are ectopic pregnancies			0
source : @entity91 mrs @entity12 was bleeding internally and by the time she reached theatre she was dangerously ill , despite having received blood transfusions			1
she said : ‘ at that time i was given a one in 50,000 chance of being alive			0
’ she was in theatre for five hours , with mr @entity7 facing the agonising prospect of losing his wife and unborn children			0
‘ when they opened her up they could see the membrane with @entity21 inside and they were going to take everything out , ’ recalled mr @entity7			2
‘ [ the consultant ] said he would n’t have given a million to one chance of the baby surviving , let alone @entity6			0
he did n’t tell us about that until much further along when we found out we were having a girl			0
’ instead of removing the womb in theatre , the consultant , mr @entity111 , managed to save both mrs @entity12 and one of the twins , @entity21 – he had to remove the one who was growing outside the womb			1
‘ the consultant said he had never seen anything like it in his whole career , ’ said mr @entity7			0
@entity21 , the surviving twin , was born prematurely at 35 weeks by caesarean section			2
she arrived on january 19 , 2010 , weighing 6lbs 1oz			0
but mrs @entity12 ’s hopes for her family did n’t end there			1
when @entity21 was two the couple started ivf treatment again in the hope of having a second child			2
they had two failed attempts before mrs @entity12 became pregnant with their second daughter , @entity22			1
mrs @entity12 was carefully monitored throughout her pregnancy again under the care of mr @entity111			1
the pregnancy went well until 37 weeks when mrs @entity12 developed pre-eclampsia and @entity22 was born by emergency caesarean on march 8 , 2013			1
@entity21 was one of twins but her twin developed outside the womb and caused mrs @entity12 to suffer internal bleeding			1
as a result , the twin had to be removed to save mrs @entity12 and @entity21 ‘ it ’s all been worth it , ’ said mrs @entity12			1
‘ it was tough at the time			0
@entity7 took some persuading after the second time round but he did say that if it was n’t for me we would n’t have @entity22			2
i ’ve got a few nice scars but a couple of trophies to go with it			0
’ the couple are indebted to mr @entity111 and the staff at @entity157			0
mr @entity111 said : ‘ i only played a small role so it is the hard work and dedication of all the nurses , doctors , midwives , and others that led to such a positive outcome for @entity6 and her family			0
‘ on behalf of myself and my colleagues , i ’d like to thank @entity6 for her kind words , and wish her , @entity21 , and the rest of the family , all the very best for the future			2

@entity12 *'s* first cycle of @entity10 failed and the second one resulted in an ectopic pregnancy - mrs @entity12 had to have her fallopian tubes removed
a third @entity10 cycle caused her to conceive twins but one developed in the scar tissue from the fallopian tube removal and caused internal bleeding
this baby had to be removed and doctors *feared* mrs @entity12 would die
*miraculously* , she survived and the other twin , @entity21 , was born *healthy*
the couple then had two more failed attempts at @entity10 before @entity22 was conceived - she was born in march 2013
