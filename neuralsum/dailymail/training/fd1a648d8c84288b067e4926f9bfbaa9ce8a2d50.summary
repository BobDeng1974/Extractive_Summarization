by @entity0 @entity1 , 62 , a shoplifter dubbed @entity4 's most prolific thief is back in jail after committing his 521st crime @entity4 ’s ' most prolific shoplifter ' has been sentenced to 16 months in jail and given an asbo banning him from his local high street today after committing his 521st crime			1
between february and march this year , @entity1 stole almost £ 600 worth of meat and alcohol from two supermarkets , and a handbag , two purses , a designer watch , clothing and perfume worth almost £ 3,000 from @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 the thefts meant he breached a four - month suspended prison sentence he was given last june for stealing £ 900 worth of goods			1
as @entity1 , 65 , was led away , judge @entity27 said he had ' never experienced in all my life sitting at the bar and bench ' a defendant who had kept ' coming back for more ' on so many occasions			1
@entity1 began his life of stealing in 1970 after falling out of a window and claiming a bump on the head made him a kleptomaniac , changing his personality and making him addicted to theft			1
during the next 44 years of offending he preyed on numerous high street shops - even taking his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip			1
the latest spree means he now has a total of 235 convictions for 521 offences , 432 of them for theft			1
if caught in any retail outlet outside @entity52 he must leave if asked to do so			0
the order will run for two years after his release			0
he must also pay a £ 120 victim surcharge			2
@entity1 was jailed for 16 months and given an asbo banning him from his local high street after admitting stealing handbags , clothes and a designer watch worth a total of £ 3,000 from stores including @entity20 after being told of @entity1 ’s catalogue of convictions judge @entity27 said : ' he is an indiscriminate thief and he should n’t be let near the shops			1
' it has affected the community of traders and everybody agrees he should n’t go around thieving			0
he is a risk to retailers - i have never seen anything like it			0
' this is a truly exceptional case , he has had every spindle opportunity not to commit these offences			2
now he is stealing high value items			1
' he told @entity80 ' it ’s theft , it ’s dishonesty and you are indiscriminate , targeting retail premises whether well known , international stores or ordinary traders			2
@entity1 claims suffers from kleptomania which compels him to steal , but psychiatric evaluations have found no evidence to back this up ' some of the victims of your thefts are institutions that can cover the loss but that does n’t take away the fact that you are a pest , you keep coming back for more			1
' everything that has been done for you has failed , you keep coming back for more			0
i think there is no other way of protecting these traders , ' one look at your antecedents means that it is totally hopeless			0
you say this is impulsive that you ca n’t help yourself			0
' you must go to custody and you have to stay in custody for a long time			0
this is your occupation , you target shops , a watch for £ 1,900 , purses , they are high value items			1
' i take into account your guilty pleas but i also take into account there is no psychiatric diagnosis that diminishes your responsibility			0
' in 1996 @entity1 's offending became so prolific his long - suffering wife @entity124 , then 46 , spoke out to condemn an 18 week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes , spirits and groceries as being too short			1
she said : ' he should have got at least 18 months			2
the only way he will stop is by being in prison			0
if he ’s in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he ’s locked up			0
' when he ’s out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again			0
i ca n’t tell you much about him because i do n’t really know him , he ’s been in and out of [ prison ] so much			0
the person who ’s suffering out of all this is me			0
' in 2008 mrs @entity80 was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to @entity142 , @entity143 , for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch			0
on a previous occasion @entity1 asked @entity149 staff to point out some perfume for him , then walked off with the £ 42 gift set they recommended today the court heard how in february this year @entity1 stole meat from @entity156 ’s worth £ 110 , alcohol from @entity158 worth £ 91 , clothes worth £ 172.96 from @entity21 and a designer watch worth £ 1,900 from @entity20 in @entity23			1
he also stole a handbag and two purses from the store totalling £ 570			2
@entity1 , of @entity164 , @entity52 , admitted seven charges of theft when he appeared before @entity52 magistrates in april , as well as admitting stealing alcohol from @entity169 worth £ 389 on 5th march this year			1
he was bailed , but went out and stole £ 335 worth of perfume from @entity22 in @entity23 the following day			1
prosecuting @entity171 said : ' in summary on the front page alone of his antecedent record there are offences involving theft and dishonesty between 1995 and 2014 , they are almost exclusively for shop lifting			2
' in @entity1 's defence , @entity180 said he should be made subject of a day - time curfew between the hours of 9pm and 6pm during shop opening times			1
mr @entity180 added : ' he seemed to think that would stop him going to shops			0
he has a compulsion , he does n’t drink alcohol ' he tells me he has no reason to leave the house as food is brought to him			2
. he returned to @entity20 - it suggests a compulsion in the theft not the profit			2
