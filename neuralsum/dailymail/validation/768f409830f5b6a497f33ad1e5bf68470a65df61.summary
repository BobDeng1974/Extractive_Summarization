with their intoxicating spices and complex flavours , @entity1 curries are enjoyed the world over			1
now , in a study of more than 2,000 recipes , scientists have discovered the secret behind curry 's popularity on a molecular level			2
they claim that unlike @entity13 dishes that tend to pair similar flavours together - such as beer and beef - @entity1 dishes use at least seven ingredients that do not contain overlapping flavours			1
now , in an analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes , scientists have discovered the secret behind curry 's popularity on a molecular level researchers at the @entity29 in @entity30 looked at how often overlapping flavour compounds were used in a dish 's ingredients			1
they reviewed of recipes on @entity35 , studying the subtle molecular - level differences that distinguish the cuisine , according to a report in the @entity39			0
' we found that average flavour sharing in @entity1 cuisine was significantly lesser than expected , ' researchers wrote			1
the study found that ingredients such as garam masala and bell peppers are usually teamed up with other ingredients that have no chemical similarity			1
out of the 381 cooking ingredients in the world , the research team from that @entity1 food used 200 in their cuisine			1
' each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients , ' the researchers said this is in contrast to @entity13 dishes that share like flavours			1
chefs , for instance claim that seemingly incongruous ingredients , such as chocolate and blue cheese , can taste good together because they share similar compounds			2
a spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories , according to a study			0
@entity77 , a bright - yellow compound found in the root of the @entity1 spice turmeric , prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain , and also removed pre-existing fear memories , researchers found			1
it is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders			0
psychologists from @entity90 trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound			0
scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze			2
hours later , when the same sound was played to the rats , those who had been given ordinary food froze			2
yet the rats fed the curcumin - rich diet did n't freeze , suggesting their fearful memories had been erased			0
an example is acetal , which can be found in whiskey , apple juice , orange juice and raw beets			2
strawberries , meanwhile , have flavour compounds that match white wine			0
in @entity1 dishes , the more overlap two ingredients have in flavour , the less likely they are to appear in the same @entity1 dish , the scientists said			1
researchers believe this makes the dish more tasty as the ingredients each bring their own unique flavour to the dish , rather than simply blending in			0

most curries contain turmeric , cumin , allspice , cardamon , ginger , garlic and capsicum - spices with strong anti-bacterial properties			0
this is largely why they 're found in dishes from hot countries , where meat needs to be preserved			2
separate studies have found that garlic , cinnamon and cumin can destroy up to 80 per cent of meat - borne bacteria , while ginger can slow bacterial growth by 25 per cent .			0

scientists studied the chemical compounds in 2,000 @entity1 dishes
they found ingredients were teamed together that had no similarity
this is in contrast to many @entity13 dishes that tend to pair flavours
out of the 381 cooking ingredients in the world , @entity1 food uses 200
