@entity0 will make a last - ditch attempt to persuade @entity2 to join them			1
but @entity2 , who was left out of @entity6 ’s @entity5 squad , is poised to leave the @entity7 and move to @entity8 @entity9 hope to rubber stamp a deal with the @entity13 left - back next week			1
curtain call : @entity2 's @entity16 career came to an end when the last @entity7 season finished there could be a new wave of @entity22 players on their way to the @entity7 after their great showing at the @entity5 and the involvement of @entity28 agency @entity26			1
@entity29 are taking @entity30 back from his loan spell in @entity32 , although the @entity33 could farm him out again and other @entity22 have attracted the eye of @entity28 scouts			1
three years ago @entity26 set up a fund to invest in several @entity38 and @entity39 clubs to help develop young players in return for an eventual return on their transfer fees			2
out to impress : @entity30 trains on friday ahead of @entity45 's semi-final against @entity47 the company has developed a strong relationship with former @entity51 striker @entity50 who is the @entity45 assistant coach and the company has a major tie - up with several clubs in @entity45			1
a number of players are now looking to capitalise on @entity45 ’s success at the @entity5 this summer by securing moved to club ’s in @entity6 or @entity59			1
@entity29 are poised to sign @entity60 from @entity61 this this week			1
the @entity33 believe they have an £ 8m deal in the bag for the @entity65 right - back who will take over from @entity67 after his move to @entity69			1
indeed @entity60 claimed in tv interview after @entity65 ’s defeat to @entity72 that he ‘ will be playing for @entity29 next season			1
’ @entity74 : @entity29 are believed to be close to completing an £ 8million deal for @entity65 's @entity60 ( right ) i am hearing while @entity78 has snubbed his uncle and @entity81 manager @entity80 to instead turn out for @entity82 ahead his move to @entity86 club @entity84 , @entity77 is poised to agree a move to @entity88			1
@entity77 has been playing a return to the @entity91 area for some time when he knew he would n’t get a new deal at @entity94			1
a luxury mansion on the @entity97 estate on the south east @entity91 / @entity99 border near the @entity100 is close to being fully renovated			0
done deal : @entity77 is set to sign for @entity81 when he returns from @entity102 i am also hearing @entity104 is one of several players on the way out of @entity94 and could move back to @entity107			1
@entity108 and @entity61 are two other possible destinations			2
@entity110 want £ 25m to sell @entity111 to @entity0			2
the @entity110 have already rejected a £ 20m offer from the @entity113			0
but they want more although it is possible they will consider one of the several squad players @entity0 have on offer as part of an exchange deal			2
why did n’t someone come up with ‘ shaving foam ’ idea at free kicks years ago ? it ’s so simple and so effective			0
it is hoped it will be adopted in the @entity7 this season			2
@entity129 will be shown the door by @entity94 as soon as new boss @entity131 gets his feet under the table			1
@entity134 , who sold @entity129 to @entity94 for £ 27m last summer , will be interested in taking the @entity137 midfielder back ; but only in a cut price deal at around £ 12m			1
the player would also have to agree to a compromise over his basic @entity141 would also be interested			0
boost : @entity137 's @entity129 has enjoyed something of a renaissance at @entity5 newcastle are also set to make a move for @entity69 ’s @entity146			1
@entity147 played just two @entity7 matches for @entity69 last season and has been told he can leave after the arrival of @entity67 from @entity29			1
the 26 - year - old has one year of his contract remaining and could be bought for as little as £ 5 million			0
young @entity154 right - back @entity153 , who came on as an early substitute in their defeat to @entity137 , has attracted the attention of several @entity7 clubs after his superb performance			1
and the 20 - year - old , who is currently at @entity162 , could secure a move to @entity0 if he impresses during a pre-season trial			1
wanted : @entity154 right - back @entity153 has attracted the attention of @entity7 clubs mon : astonishingly , @entity167 comes out and protests his innocence			1
the utter absence of remorse should have persuaded @entity171 to double his suspension			0
tues : at last @entity173 makes a form of apology but it ’s just a cynical way of keeping his move to @entity178 alive			2
who would have thought it ? @entity137 ’s 2 - 1 win over the @entity154 turns out to be one of the all - time @entity5 classics			1
weds : @entity178 officials fly into @entity91 and start formal talks with @entity0 about buying @entity173 who was off to @entity59 before his biting incident anyway			2
but @entity0 have had to take a cut on the £ 100m they wanted with the cash sum dropping close to £ 60 million			2
thurs : former @entity6 under 21 boss @entity192 slams @entity193 for not blooding players properly via the @entity196 set - up ; he 's right			2
fri : it was n’t pretty as @entity102 bruised their way in to the semi-final by beating @entity201 2 - 1			0
but with @entity202 now out @entity72 have the ability and the mental toughness to beat the hosts in the last four			0
@entity206 @entity207 has said he no longer wants to see @entity102 win the @entity5 because they are not playing @entity208			2
with @entity202 now out they lack @entity212 stars in the grand tradition			0
ironically @entity72 , who they now face in the semi-finals , used to pride themselves on grinding out results like @entity102 have but now play the more expansive football			0
in that respect , if this tournament is to be remembered as one of the best ever then i suspect @entity207 would like to see @entity72 beat @entity102 then lift the trophy for the first time since 1990			0
that was one of the dullest - ever tournaments , @entity6 ’s great exploits apart of course			2
in many ways i agree			0
it might seem romantic for @entity102 to win a sixth @entity5 in @entity232 next week but not if the imprint they leave is bruises not @entity212 soccer			1
mind you , the free kick @entity237 scored against @entity238 was in the grand tradition of @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 but the world really would seem upside down if a @entity246 centre half turns out to be their @entity5 hero			2
stunning : @entity102 defender @entity237 strikes an unstoppable free - kick into the top corner of the net set piece : @entity252 and @entity238 keeper @entity253 look on as @entity102 take the lead on friday substance over style for a sixth star : some believe @entity102 are abandoning the style that made them great ... particularly in the @entity5 in 1970 , which they won with a 4 - 1 victory over @entity261 btw @entity262 hit the nail on the head the other day when he said one of the problems of developing young talent in @entity6 is because there is less and less sport in school , especially outside school hours			1
there are several reasons for that			0
one of them is the academy system at big clubs			0
one of the many down sides of the academies is that they draw talent away from school , district and county teams which used to be a route to the top for many players			0
big @entity288 has told all the critics he has faced that they ‘ can go to hell ’			0
foot on the ball , @entity293 the @entity246 public will not take kindly to their romantic vision of football being revised and if he continues to go completely against the @entity212 spirit he could be the first manager to win a @entity5 and be sacked within days			0
@entity299 since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in @entity5 finals			0
thirty five of them are still alive			0
celebrated photographer @entity305 managed to track them down over the last few years and has compiled an amazing collection of portraits of @entity241 , @entity309 and so on but of course not @entity311 or @entity312			0
they are currently being exhibited at the trendy bar / gallery @entity315 which is in @entity316 , @entity91 just up to road from @entity318			0
back of the net : since 1930 there have been 56 scorers in @entity5 finals , including @entity241 in 1970 if you are in the area it ’s a must visit			1
there is also a great @entity327 exhibition there too			0
the unique collection will be up for auction soon and it is believed the collection could fetch over £ 100,000			0
that sounds a lot but not when you think @entity337 ’s bedroom installation art ‘ classic ’ is supposedly worth over £ 2m .			0

@entity0 will make an 11th - hour attempt to persuade @entity2 to join
we may be seeing a few @entity45 stars in the @entity7 after their @entity5 showing
@entity29 are poised to sign @entity60 from @entity61 this this week
@entity77 will agree a move to @entity81 to link up with @entity347
@entity129 will be shown the door by @entity94
newcastle are set to make a move for @entity69 ’s @entity146
