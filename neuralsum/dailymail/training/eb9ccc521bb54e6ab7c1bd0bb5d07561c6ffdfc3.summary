restrictions imposed on the movement of poultry after an outbreak of bird flu have now been lifted , the government has said			1
some 6,000 ducks were culled on a farm at @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , following the identification of ' highly pathogenic ' @entity13 bird flu last month			1
the disease was the same strain as one confirmed at a chicken farm in the central province of @entity19 , the @entity20 , and in @entity21			1
around 6,000 were culled on a farm in @entity10 , after bird flu was discovered last month - today the government has announced that restrictions imposed on nearby poultry farms have finally been lifted the farm is operated by the @entity29 's largest producer of duck and duck products , @entity32 , which sells ready meals to @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
most types of bird flu are harmless to humans but two types - @entity41 and @entity43 - have caused serious concerns			1
in a statement today , the @entity45 , @entity45 , said : ' on sunday , december 21 all restrictions following the outbreak were lifted			1
' this means that all poultry - keeping farms within the 10 kilometre ( 6.2 mile ) surveillance zone around the infected property are now allowed to move poultry and other animals without restriction			2
the farm which was found to be infected is operated by the @entity29 's largest producer of duck and duck products ' other restrictions covering the storage , transport and sourcing of meat products are also lifted			1
' a protected zone which imposed additional movement controls on properties within three kilometres of the infected farm was lifted on friday			1
' @entity67 , chief vet for @entity45 , said : ' protecting our country from animal diseases is important for our economy and our robust and thorough approach to tackling this outbreak means we are able to lift these restrictions at the earliest possible point allowed by @entity77 law			2
all poultry - keeping farms within the 10 kilometre surveillance zone around the infected property were temporarily banned from moving their birds around ' this outbreak should serve as a reminder for the poultry industry of the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity to minimise the risk of infection and i would urge keepers to remain vigilant for any signs of disease and report suspicions to their vet immediately			2
' following confirmation of the outbreak last month , all poultry on the infected premises were humanely destroyed and the affected farm was cleansed and disinfected			2
' the advice from @entity101 and the chief medical officer is that the risk to public health is very low and the @entity105 has said there is no food safety risk for consumers			0
' investigations are ongoing into the most likely source of the outbreak			2
' the @entity10 outbreak was the first serious case of bird flu in the @entity29 since 2008 when the @entity116 strand was found in free range hens near @entity118 , @entity119			1
when the strain was confirmed emergency restrictions were immediately put in place on the movement of birds and eggs			1
@entity45 carried out the cull on november 18 and began when a culling team dressed in chemical contamination suits marched into the first of six large barns			0
they put batches of 80 ducks in large plastic crates that were loaded into a 20ft long chamber where they were gassed to death in around 15 minutes			2
the dead ducks were soaked in disinfectant and dumped inside a lorry to be transported for incineration			0
at the time a @entity45 spokesman said the cull was being carried out in a ‘ safe and humane manner ’ by fully - trained staff from the government ’s @entity145			0
officials are still investigating how the virus reached @entity10			0
the @entity149 said it is possible the virus is still being carried around @entity29 by migrating swans which are showing no signs of disease			2
but environment secretary @entity155 insisted there was no risk to human health - as the @entity41 strain which has killed 400 people globally was ruled out at an early stage			0
instead it is the @entity13 strain found in @entity21 and the @entity20 , which has never been known to cross over into humans			1
@entity32 has 33 @entity29 sites for breeding , hatching , growing or slaughtering 7million ducks a year , mostly in @entity167 and @entity10			2
the farm at @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , where ' highly pathogenic ' h5n8 bird flu was found police guard the entrance to the farm after bird flu was discovered last month - 6,000 ducks have been culled bird flu - officially known as avian influenza - infects poultry around the world , often with no symptoms and no danger to people			1
but some strains have been known to cross into humans with deadly results , notably with the @entity41 and @entity43 varieties			0
the @entity41 strain first infected humans in @entity188 in 1997 before re-emerging in 2003 and spreading from @entity189 to @entity190 and @entity191			0
some 393 people have died from the strain since 2003 - more than half of the 667 who were infected			0
@entity196 had by far the most deaths , followed by @entity198 and @entity199			0
the @entity43 strain has caused particular concern since it emerged last year			0
it has not yet been reported outside @entity203 but the closure of live bird markets for several months as a precaution has devastated farmers			0
the incubation period ranges from two to eight days and symptoms include a fever , cough , diarrhoea , vomiting , abdominal and pain and bleeding from the nose and gums			0
antiviral drugs can lessen the severity of the disease and help patients survive			0
the biggest risk of catching bird flu is from direct contact with infected poultry , particularly carcasses			1
there is no evidence ' properly cooked food ' can infect people with the virus			0
the @entity13 strain , the one found in the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity29 , has never been known to pass to humans			1

more than 6,000 ducks were culled on farm after @entity13 bird flu was found
movement restrictions on nearby poultry farms have been lifted today
@entity241 was same strain as one confirmed at chicken farm in @entity20
the outbreak was the first serious case of bird flu in the @entity29 since 2008
