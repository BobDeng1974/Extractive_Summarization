by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 22 april 2013 after he was orphaned two years ago , scientists did not think a young chimp could survive without help from an adopted parent - and least of all from the alpha male			1
but that 's exactly what happened to ' @entity9 ' , the star of new @entity12 documentary , @entity13 , when he was welcomed in by patriarch ' @entity14 '			1
having previously shown great aggression over the other males to secure leadership of his chimp colony , @entity14 now proved he could also be the daddy of them all			2
they watched in amazement as @entity14 showed a tenderness towards the young orphan			1
he allowed tiny @entity9 to ride on his back , cracked nuts for him and delicately groomed his fur			2
before long , @entity14 was sharing his nest with @entity9 cradled inside his massive arms			1
such an adoption , which is extremely rare , is captured in all its poignancy in the film , which is released in the @entity46 next month			2
world - renowned primatologist professor @entity47 , who has spent more than 30 years studying the chimpanzees of @entity49 in @entity51 's @entity50 , where the filming took place , said such behaviour in the animal kingdom was almost unheard of			1
‘ i ’ve never seen a male like @entity14 take up the role of a mother like that , ’ he said			1
alone : @entity9 was orphaned after his mother was killed , possibly by a leopard @entity62 , who co-directed the film with @entity64 described the touching scenes as ' the best storyline we never wrote '			1
he said : ‘ it was amazing and very touching to see this big , normally gruff male pour his love and devotion into caring for @entity9			1
‘ it was pretty clear that the story of @entity9 and @entity14 was going to touch other people as much as it touched us			1
if we ’d scripted it , no one would have believed us			0
it was the best storyline we never wrote			2
’ ‘ it was very moving to see @entity9 ’s longing for some sort of protection and closeness and the tenderness that @entity14 showed him			1
' the project took 700 days of filming over three - and - a - half years and the crew endured a host of obstacles , including swarms of aggressive bees , torrential rain , extreme humidity and deadly snakes			2
they at first followed a different chimpanzee mother and baby , but when the crew came across @entity100 and her newborn @entity9 , they knew they had found a special chimp			2
‘ almost as soon as he was born , @entity9 was bouncing around doing all this look - at - me stuff			1
he wrote himself into the script			0
but we had no idea he ’d have such an eventful life			0
’ an older mum with seemingly unlimited patience , @entity108 nuzzles @entity9 with chimpanzee kisses in the film , tucks him up safely at night in a hammock of branches high in the trees , and makes a start on his education			2
for thousands of years , the chimps of the @entity119 have used a sophisticated technique to crack their favourite walnut - like cola nuts , handing their unique skill down through generations			0
helping hand : @entity14 cracks open nuts for the orphaned @entity9 they use tree roots as anvils and carry heavy stone hammers for miles through the forest			1
‘ one of the funniest things is seeing little ones like @entity9 trying to learn , because they keep getting it wrong , ’ @entity62 says			1
‘ they miss the nut and hit their foot instead			0
or they try with a piece of wood and the wood keeps breaking			0
’ heavily reliant on his mother , @entity9 will not be weaned until he reaches the age of four and will only become fully independent at the age of ten			0
but @entity9 has only reached the age of three when tragedy strikes - @entity108 is injured during a territorial fight with a rival band of chimps and never seen again			2
father and son : the adoption of @entity9 by a dominant male like @entity14 surprised scientists it is presumed she fell prey to leopards in her weakened state , leaving @entity9 vulnerable , hungry and left to die - that is until @entity14 , the patriarch and alpha - male steps in to become his new parent			1
@entity13 marks the fourth production from @entity12 's @entity165 division , which was launched in 2008			1
following the box office success of @entity168 , oceans and @entity170 , the film has already taken $ 30million ( £ 20m ) in @entity171 alone			0
@entity12 has pledged to make a significant donation to the @entity13 , @entity174 cause , set up by the @entity175 , which aims to highlight the plight of these animals			1
once numbering more than a million , in just 50 years there are now only 200,000 chimps left in the wild			1
it is predicted that within 20 years , through hunting , disease and decimation of forests , chimps will become extinct in ten countries			0
so what next for @entity9 and @entity14 ? unfortunately , filmgoers wo n't discover if there is a happy ending to this otherwise @entity12 - like tale			1
‘ we do n’t know , ’ @entity62 admits			0
@entity14 is alive and well and has been recently sighted			0
@entity9 , however , who would now be five years old , has not been seen for some time			2
‘ nobody knows where he is			0
but it ’s a big forest , so that ’s not unusual			0
he could be absolutely fine			0
‘ i hope people will feel chimps are just like us – with all the trials and tribulations in their lives that we have in ours			0
they ’re not so very different from us and they deserve our respect			0
’ chimpanzee will be released in cinemas on friday , 3 may			0
swing time : @entity9 plays among the woodland of the @entity119 , in @entity51 's @entity50			0

tough alpha male @entity14 shows his softer side by adopting young @entity9 in new @entity12 documentary , @entity13
such an adoption in the animal kingdom has never been seen by scientists or film - makers before
director @entity62 described touching scenes as ' the best storyline we never wrote '
@entity12 hopes to raise *awareness* of chimpanzees ' plight
over 50 years , number in the wild has fallen from a million to 200,000
