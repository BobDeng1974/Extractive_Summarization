by @entity0 published : 23:16 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 04:54 est , 20 november 2013 it is already @entity3 's longest war , but a new draft of a key @entity3 - @entity6 security deal reveals plans for military forces to stay on indefinitely in @entity6 - costing the taxpayer tens of billions			1
the wide ranging document , obtained by @entity11 , outlines plans to stay on until 2024 ' and beyond ' - maintaining bases in @entity6 and paying to support and train hundreds of thousands of @entity6 security forces			1
@entity6 officials hope that up to 15,000 @entity3 troops will remain in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawl date as the @entity3 faces a never - ending war against @entity19 and the @entity20 in the war torn nation			1
endless war : @entity3 soldiers arrive at the site of a suicide attack in @entity27 , the capital city of @entity28 south of @entity29 on september 8 , 2013 the 25 - page ' @entity30 and the @entity32 of @entity6 ' is to be debated in @entity29 this week by 2,500 academics and tribal elders in an event known as a @entity36 , which is @entity37 for ' @entity38 '			2
indeed , @entity6 president @entity39 has said that he wont sign it without the approval of the jirga			0
the draft agreement has been the result of back and forth negotiations between @entity3 and @entity6 officials and reveals multiple concessions and revisions			0
under the new definition of relations between the two nations , @entity6 would allow the @entity3 to operate military bases , train their security personnel and to conduct counter-terrorism operations against @entity19 after the current mission is due to end in 2014			1
@entity6 policemen look on they stand guard near the premises where the forthcoming @entity36 will be held in @entity29 on november 19 , 2013 @entity6 policemen guard checkpoints overlooking @entity29 , @entity6 as security in the @entity6 capital is tightened ahead of a @entity36 the agreement also makes provisions for the @entity3 to fund and equip @entity6 's police and security forces , because @entity29 can not afford it at the moment			1
the deal between the two nations would take effect on january 1st , 2015 and ' shall remain in force until the end of 2024 and beyond			0
' however , with two years notice from @entity75 or @entity29 the agreement could conceivably come to an end			0
one issue of contention between the two nations was in the july draft stating that @entity3 troops would have to train and plan their war on terror from the security of their bases and not be allowed to travel around the country			1
in addition , @entity3 troops would not be allowed to make arrests or enter @entity6 homes			1
@entity6 --- soldiers with the @entity92 's 1 - 320 @entity91 , @entity93 shield themselves from the dust as a @entity96 helicopter takes off outside @entity97 in the @entity98 in 2010 ' no detention or arrest shall be carried out by the @entity3 forces			2
the @entity3 forces shall not search any homes or other real estate properties , ' it says			0
this caused consternation as high up as the president , and is described by senior defense officials as the one issue which could derail the entire deal			0
however , a newer draft that has been seen by the @entity113 administration seems to suggest that @entity3 forces will be allowed to leave their bases and conduct full operations within @entity6			2
the question of how many troops will remain is still up for negotiation , with @entity6 officials telling @entity11 that they hope 10 - 15,000 will stay			2
tough decisions : @entity3 president @entity113 ( @entity122 ) visits with troops in the @entity125 dining facility at @entity126 on march 28 , 2010 while president @entity127 addresses troops at @entity126 in 2006 a soldier with an injured ankle from the @entity92 's 1 - 320 @entity91 , @entity93 is assisted past his burning @entity132 armored vehicle after it struck an @entity135 ( @entity135 ) in 2010 in @entity6 @entity3 officials tell @entity11 the number is closer to seven to eight thousand , with an additional contribution from @entity139			0
regardless , committing tens of thousands of troops to a minimum decade - long mission will cost the taxpayer billions			0
@entity3 and @entity6 officials believe the presence of @entity3 troops in the country will help the government establish itself in the long term and reduce the chance of the country slipping back into civil war			1
a spokesperson for the @entity152 did not comment on the draft version of the agreement , but said that ' the president is still reviewing options from his national security team and has not made a decision about a possible @entity3 presence after 2014			0

new @entity3 - @entity6 security deal proposes @entity3 troops to remain in @entity6 until 2024 and beyond
up to 15,000 troops could stay in military bases in the war - torn nation to train @entity6 security forces and conduct *anti-terror* missions
will cost the taxpayer tens of billions
