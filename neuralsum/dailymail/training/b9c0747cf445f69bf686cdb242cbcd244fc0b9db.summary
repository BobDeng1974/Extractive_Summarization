@entity1 manager @entity0 believes owner @entity2 will ultimately be successful in his attempt to change the club 's name to @entity1			1
@entity2 revealed this week that he put @entity1 up for sale in april , within a day of the @entity8 decision to reject his proposed rebrand			1
but the outspoken @entity10 has kept his options open by beginning a process of arbitration with the @entity14 - not the @entity17 as originally stated - and will remain at the helm his plans are upheld			1
@entity0 has long played the pragmatist in the ongoing stand - off between @entity2 and disgruntled sections of the fan - base , but has always been adamant that the local businessman is a positive influence on the club			1
@entity2 announced that he is trying to sell @entity1 after the @entity14 rejected his attempted name change he is desperate to maintain what has thus far been a productive relationship - last season brought their highest - ever league finish and a first @entity33 final appearance - and expects arbitration to eventually yield a change from @entity1 to @entity1			1
' i think there will be a positive outcome			0
that means he will stay and he will win his case			2
i genuinely believe that will be the case , ' said @entity0			1
' those are my thoughts			0
we have seen change before			2
one club ( @entity45 ) went from @entity46 to @entity47			2
@entity48 left @entity49 ... i never thought that would have happened back in the day			0
the fans even sang ' @entity52 till we die '			2
' but they moved into a nice new stadium and everyone forgot about it			0
' if he was looking to leave the @entity59 and move to @entity60 , then i can understand there would be all sorts of arguments raging			0
it is business as usual for @entity0 who says the owner 's views must be respected ' but when you talk about a name change , there is an ' @entity1 ' in there			1
' does that have to stay ? for me , can we find a middle ground ? i think we know now what the situation is so let 's see what the @entity17 says			1
' but i think it has a long course to play			0
' @entity2 's son @entity84 , the acting chief executive and vice-chairman , told @entity85 on friday that he expected a resolution to the @entity14 arbitration process by november			1
@entity2 senior has pledged his full commitment in the meantime , at least in the absence of a suitable buyer , and handed @entity0 a bumper transfer kitty in the summer to prove the point			1
and should his appeal be thrown out again and he ultimately leaves the club , @entity0 would expect his own future to be doubtful too			1
' if he leaves and a new man comes in , then what will he want ? they 'll want their own man , ' he said			0
many @entity1 fans oppose the name change but @entity2 is adamant that it must happen of he will leave ' of course , i do n't want him to leave and i do n't think the vast majority of the supporters do either			1
' like any good football club , the relationship the manager has with his chief executive or owner has to be strong			2
' if it 's not , then you ca n't work			1
i 've got on well with him over the last couple of years because he 's let me get on and manage			2
' i 'm fortunate enough to know that i never have any interference at all			0
not in buying of players , team selection			0
he 's never questioned why i played 4 - 3 - 3 or three at the back			0
' he 's let me manage and that for me is a breath of fresh air when i hear about the madness that goes on around the world			0
' i really genuinely feel like he does n't want to sell but he feels that strongly on it ( the @entity1 issue )			1
' when you see him come out and tell the world , there is no turning back			0
' i think he genuinely means what he says			0
that there is no grey area			0
but , as far as i am concerned , he has no real intention to sell			0
he does n't want to sell but will do if forced into a corner			2

@entity2 says he will give the club away if he can not find a buyer
but @entity0 maintains ' he does n't really want to sell '
decision over name will go to @entity17
supporters ' group @entity149 we die continue to oppose the change
@entity153 say they support @entity2 's *leadership* and hope he stays but *insist* the name should stay
