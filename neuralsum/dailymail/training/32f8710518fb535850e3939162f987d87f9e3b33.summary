@entity0 are anxiously monitoring @entity2 ’s fitness amid fears that he could miss the @entity5 semi-final showdown with @entity6			1
the 34 - year - old was substituted at half - time during saturday ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity10 to protect a tight hamstring			0
he has subsequently received treatment at @entity0 ’s @entity14 training base but his involvement in the weekend trip to @entity17 is in doubt			1
@entity0 captain @entity2 celebrates with goalscorer @entity19 at @entity10 on saturday the 34 - year - old had to be replaced at half - time at @entity10 last saturday with a tight hamstring with the first leg of the @entity5 tie played at @entity26 72 hours later , should @entity2 fail to appear at @entity27 , there would then be a question mark over whether he would be ready to face @entity30 ’s men			1
@entity2 brings the curtain down on his glittering @entity26 career at the end of the season and the perfect send - off would be to win a trophy before he joins @entity38			2
the @entity5 perhaps offers the best chance to fulfil that dream			0
no firm decisions will be made until later in the week and , until then , @entity2 will continue to work closely with @entity0 ’s medical staff to maximise his chances of being involved in the match with @entity6			1
@entity46 forward @entity45 poses for a photo with @entity0 captain @entity2 @entity45 is also unlikely to play in either leg of the semi-final			1
the striker has returned to training at @entity14 following extensive treatment in the @entity53 but the @entity46 international , who has not played since august 31 last year , has yet to join in a full training session			2
@entity0 — preparing to open contract talks with @entity57 , who has 18 months left on his deal — are desperate to bring @entity45 ’s goal threat back into their team but , at the same time , they are also aware of the need to be patient			0
it is looking certain , meanwhile , that @entity0 will return to @entity63 in the summer for their pre-season tour , with the likelihood being that they will play games in @entity67 and @entity68			0
a two - week tour of the @entity70 could also include a fixture in @entity72 and one in @entity73			0
when they played in @entity63 two years ago , a crowd of 95,000 saw them beat @entity77 2 - 0 in the @entity78			0
@entity45 's last game for @entity0 came in their 3 - 0 defeat of @entity81 in august 2014			2

@entity0 play @entity17 in the @entity83 on saturday
@entity86 ' side then face @entity6 in the @entity5
the first leg of their semi-final clash is at @entity26 on *january* 20
@entity2 is a doubt after a hamstring *problem* last weekend
