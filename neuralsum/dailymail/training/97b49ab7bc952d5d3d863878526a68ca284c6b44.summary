plagued by excruciating cystitis , @entity0 is too scared to leave the house , struggles to hold down a job and dreads having sex with her boyfriend			1
the 23 - year - old says she feels as though she has ' paper cuts and acid inside ' - and that the pain is ' unbearable '			1
she is one of 400,000 people in the country , the majority of them women , who suffer with a chronic form of the bladder condition , known by its medical name interstitial cystitis ( @entity18 )			1
cystitis is linked to infection , but interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall , which can follow childbirth , surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections , though sometimes there is no known cause			1
while it â€™s more common in women over 40 , it can affect younger women , too			0
miss @entity0 , from @entity47 , has suffered the condition since she was 11 years old , having been plagued by kidney and bladder problems since birth			1
the chronic bladder infections have left her in severe pain , and facing a constant urge to go to the toilet			1
she struggles to hold down a job and her social life has been sacrificed because of her illness			1
she claims the side effects from her medication cause anxiety , hair loss and early menopause , which means she can not have children			0
after 12 years of enduring regular painful bouts of cystitis , miss @entity0 was finally diagnosed with the chronic form of the condition earlier this year			1
but she is yet to find an effective medication to ease her condition			0
unfortunately , patients are frequently misdiagnosed as simply being prone to urinary infections			0
this means they are given antibiotics , which - because there is no infection - do not solve the problem			0
the former @entity78 student said : ' it feels like there are paper cuts and acid inside me and the pain is unbearable			0
' during a flare leaving the house is n't even an option			1
after the 23 - year - old 's social life suffered , her sister bought her a dog , @entity93 , last year to help her through her illness			1
she said : ' i strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like i do ' interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area			1
like regular cystitis , @entity18 sufferers experience an urgency and frequent need to urinate			1
but the condition does n't respond to treatment with antibiotics , because it is not caused by a bacterial infection			2
around 400,000 people in the @entity115 suffer the condition			1
more than 90 per cent of these cases are in women			0
the condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40			0
what causes @entity18 ? researchers are not clear on the causes of the condition			0
there is a school of thought that believes the illness is inherited			0
it is also thought to be linked to other conditions including irritiable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia			0
another theory is that one of the protective layers of the bladder wall may ' leak ' in people with @entity18 , allowing chemicals in the urine to irritate the bladder			1
people with @entity18 often have small areas of scarring , stiffness or bleeding on the wall of their bladder			2
lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms it is possible to reduce the symptoms by making some lifestyle changes			0
how is @entity18 treated ? there is no single treatment , with each sufferer finding different therapies helpful			0
treatments include : source : @entity158 ' i rarely want or initiate sex with my boyfriend because it 's so painful , i know i 'll suffer afterwards			2
' my illness definitely takes its toll on our relationship , but luckily he is extremely understanding			2
' i 've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness			1
' i wonder will i ever find a job that will accommodate my chronic agony and everything that comes with it			2
' as well as suffering with @entity18 , @entity0 also lives with endometriosis and vulvodynia - a persistent and unexplained pain in the vulva , the skin surrounding the vagina - which add to her agony			1
' @entity18 makes me feel completely useless so i suffer with severe depression and was diagnosed with @entity180 [ clinical depression ] in 2012 , ' said miss @entity0			1
' i 've received counselling from a psychologist to help me accept my conditions and to help me live with the chronic pain			2
' but that along with the eight medications i take per day has n't provided much comfort			0
' bladder and kidney infections are a regular occurrence for the @entity18 sufferer , but this year alone miss @entity0 has had a flare up every month			1
as a result of her condition , her education has also been sacrificed as she was too afraid to make the journey to college in case she desperately needed to toilet			0
she said : ' there are so many girls who are too embarrassed to speak out about @entity18 but it 's so common and awareness needs to be raised			0
' there 's so many support groups and foundations that are there to give support			0
' a @entity209 and @entity210 spokesperson said : ' @entity18 is a chronic condition and there is no cure			2
' sufferers can need to urinate up to 40 times in a 24 - hour period and the pain is excruciating			1
' many sufferers suffer exhaustion , anxiety and depression as a result of the disease - some are even suicidal			2
' we provide sufferers with information on the various treatments available to alleviate symptoms and support			0
' we also run local groups around the country so that sufferers can meet others with the disease and know that they are not alone			0
' miss @entity0 is now hoping to raise awareness about her condition			2
she has found support at the @entity239 group @entity238 , where she talks to women all over the world who share their advice and stories with each other			0
the condition causes miss @entity0 to suffer regular , painful bouts of cystitis - at least once a month			1
she said : ' i 've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness ' ' it 's nice to know you 're not alone and that there are other people going through the same thing			1
it definitely brings some comfort and helps during a bad day , ' miss @entity0 said			2
after miss @entity0 's condition destroyed her social life , her sister bought her a @entity266 puppy , @entity93 last year			1
she said : ' my illness takes its toll not only on me but on my whole family			0
' i strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like i do			2
' he 's my best friend and he instantly makes me feel calmer when i 'm struggling			0
