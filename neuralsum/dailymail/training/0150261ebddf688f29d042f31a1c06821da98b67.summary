click here to read @entity3 manager @entity2 's comments after the game ferocious in @entity5 , flimsy at home			1
if @entity3 ’s progress in the @entity9 has been without a hitch , uncertainty dogs their domestic form			1
a game at home to @entity15 , in theory , should have been a straightforward opportunity for @entity2 ’s squad to make up lost ground in their pursuit of a top four spot			1
when @entity23 gave them a first - half lead , all seemed to be going to plan			1
had this been a contest on a thursday night , @entity3 would , in all likelihood , have motored away but there is something about the @entity30 that means their footing is not so sure			1
@entity2 has been eager to embrace @entity3 ’s @entity5 adventure , but this was the first occasion when he admitted that , perhaps , the extra demands are having a negative impact			1
running out of energy and ideas in a lacklustre second half , @entity3 were booed off at the final whistle			1
‘ i do n’t think it was a negative reaction , ’ @entity2 argued			2
‘ i think it was the fans seeing that they had three points in the bag but then leaving with one			2
‘ our supporters have been magnificent			2
i think it was more about emotions than a moan			2
the longer the game went on , the worse it was for us			2
‘ we had five shots on target , 13 chances			0
@entity15 stopped the clock and made it difficult for us to build momentum			1
i ’m not bitter about the way the opposition played			2
‘ we need to learn from this			0
teams are coming here and making it difficult for us			0
we need to get back to where we are			0

having endured a month of misery , seeing his side plummet into the drop zone on the back of four straight defeats , finally @entity75 had some respite			0
it had looked as if the barren run @entity15 have endured was going to continue at @entity87 , when @entity23 pounced in the 34th minute , but @entity75 ’s introduction of @entity35 for the injured @entity165 could not have been better timed			1
@entity35 ’s arrival gave @entity15 an injection of belief and gave purpose to their play			1
within five minutes of replacing @entity165 , he had scored the goal to secure a point for @entity15 and allow @entity75 to relax			1
his side have suffered some cruel luck in recent weeks , so this was long overdue			0
‘ we need a result and we need to give everyone a lift , ’ said @entity75			0
‘ the last month has been difficult			0
‘ thankfully we have taken something from the game			0
if there was going to be a team to win it in the second half , it was going to be us			2
‘ it has been a frustrating time			0
the only time we have let ourselves down was at @entity188			0
we could be four , five six points better off			0
but others could say that			0
‘ this is the second season and that is harder			0
we have to deal with expectation			0

teams with brittle confidence would have folded when @entity3 started passing the ball with purpose , inspired by the surging runs and clever movement of @entity54			1
when @entity47 chipped a pass forward and @entity23 flicked it on , @entity54 scampered down the flank to stretch @entity15 ’s defence			1
he pulled the ball back for @entity23 , who did the rest , driving in from 10 yards with his left foot			2
it was his seventh goal of the campaign			0
yet that was as good as it got			0
@entity15 began the second half with purpose , preying on @entity3 ’s lethargy and they got their reward when @entity35 drifted beyond a limp challenge from @entity48 before drilling a shot beyond @entity38 at the near post			1
from that point , @entity15 — who almost won it when a header from former @entity3 player @entity73 dropped the wrong side of the post — were comfortable and @entity3 ran out of ideas			1
a point gained for @entity75 , two squandered for @entity2			0
‘ in the second half of the season we have to get back to our way of playing , ’ said the @entity248 manager			2
that lesson needs to be heeded otherwise their top four hopes will slip away			0
