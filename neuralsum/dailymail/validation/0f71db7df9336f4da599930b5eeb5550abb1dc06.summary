@entity0 travel away from @entity1 for a game that will shape the destiny of their season and @entity7 ' confidence is telling			1
' if we beat them , they can not do it , ' @entity7 proclaims ahead of a trip to @entity13			0
he had just been asked what the consequences would be if @entity16 , who were trying desperately to keep pace in the race for the @entity20 , lost to @entity0			1
his words are backed up by a swaggering display , full of devilment , wit and counter-attacking menace			0
@entity16 are left punch - drunk by a 3 - 0 defeat that could have been even heavier , as @entity29 – with two pressure penalties – and @entity31 ran amok			1
@entity29 scored two penalties as @entity0 won 3 - 0 at @entity16 on march 16 , 2014 @entity31 ( bottom ) was also on the scoresheet as @entity0 built a 14 - point gap over their arch - rivals @entity0 headed home that afternoon with a 14 - point gap over their rivals in the @entity40 and had effectively destroyed any lingering hope that @entity42 had of commandeering a top four spot			1
it was a day when @entity7 saw his players make a massive statement of intent , a day that suggested there was a shift in the balance of power of this rivalry ; leaving @entity13 then , you felt it would be a long time before the deficit would be clawed back			0
fast forward to march 16 , 2015			1
again @entity0 were away from @entity1 for a vital fixture and again @entity7 ' confidence in the build - up was telling but , this time , there was no performance of verve and invention to back up his pre-game message			1
there was , however , doggedness , determination and the result was just as crucial			0
@entity68 's freak goal , coming after they had spent much of a rain - sodden night in @entity70 riding their luck and defending for their lives , has set them up for another afternoon of destiny with their most bitter foe			2
@entity68 scored a second - half winner for @entity0 as they won 1 - 0 at @entity79 on monday night @entity68 runs off to celebrate his winner that moved @entity0 within two points of the top four @entity68 's ( right ) shot was deflected over the top of @entity79 goalkeeper @entity85 and into the net the goal was @entity68 's ( right ) third in the last three @entity40 games for @entity0 no trophy will be presented at @entity1 next sunday but there is the sense that the winner of @entity0 and @entity16 's latest showdown will take all in relation to the final spot in next year 's @entity20			1
it is going to be another day of reckoning			0
do not underestimate how much @entity0 needed this result at the @entity100			2
they have stylishly worked their way into contention for the top four with a long unbeaten run but @entity16 's victory over @entity105 had threatened to alter the landscape			2
what if a loss in @entity108 and had then be follow up with a defeat at @entity1 ? such a scenario would have left bleak consequences for @entity0			2
those result would have left them with an eight - point deficit and not enough time to claw it back , especially with some tricky assignments looming			0
as it is , they go into @entity120 football 's @entity118 brimming with confidence , two points behind @entity16 but ready to leapfrog @entity124 's men			1
they will need to step up on what they produced against @entity79 to topple @entity16 but @entity7 has a glint in his eye and faith in his team			1
@entity0 striker @entity130 ( centre ) tries to wriggle away from a challenge from @entity79 's @entity133 @entity0 might not have last year 's electric swagger but they certainly know how to fight and , in some ways , the results they have put together since losing at @entity13 on december 14 have been just as impressive as their unexpected title - charge			1
nobody proved that determination more than @entity68 , who emerged from a difficult first 45 minutes to keep on running and score the decisive goal , his challenge on @entity143 looping over @entity85 's head to leave @entity7 ' punching the air			0
@entity68 keeps on producing these important moments			0
for all the noise that is being created around @entity148 and his contract stand - off , the most pressing contractual issue @entity0 have is with their vice-captain			2
he has scored in each of his last three @entity40 games and has led the team with distinction in @entity29 's absence			0
young , hungry , talented @entity120 players like him are not ten - a - penny and it would be folly to let this drift			0
@entity0 should really get this business concluded			0
