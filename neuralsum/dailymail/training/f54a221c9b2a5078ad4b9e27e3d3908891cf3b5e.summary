by @entity0 last updated at 7:47 pm on 14th november 2011 a cellist who had his memory almost completely wiped out by a serious brain infection stunned doctors because he is still able to remember music			1
the @entity6 , who played for a famous orchestra , was barely able to recall anything about his life before 2005			1
but despite being struck down by the condition which affects just one in half a million people , he was able to recognise the scale and rhythm of music he was played			1
brain virus : the @entity6 , known only as @entity21 , suffered from herpesviral encephaliti and had his memory almost completely wiped in tests his musical memory was classified as ' normal ' - even though the rest of his brain was so badly affected he could not remember the layout of his flat , the @entity23 reported			1
the 71 - year - old - known only as @entity21 - has continued to play his cello in his own home			2
he suffered from an infection called herpesviral encephalitis which is extremely difficult to treat			0
the virus travels along nerves before getting into the brain			2
neurologist @entity38 , based at @entity39 , @entity40 , said the case is significant as it could give doctors a new insight into how memories are stored			0
the case is similar to that of @entity47 , a conductor who was also hit by the virus			1
he is still able to play music despite remembering very little before he suffered from the rare condition in 1985			1
neurologist mr @entity38 told the @entity23 that @entity21 had effectively lost everything apart from his knowledge of music			2
' he can hardly remember a thing			0
he has no memory of any personal or professional events , ' he said			0
' he is living in the moment , more or less			0
he has lost his whole life			0
' @entity21 's brother and care worker were the only people he could recognise			1
the medial temporal lobes , used to remember important information , were very badly damaged by the virus			2
mr @entity38 , speaking at a @entity67 event in @entity68 , said the case suggests that music is stored in a different part of the brain to other memories			2
doctors played @entity21 music he was familiar with before he was struck down by the virus in 2005			1
they then played him more recent work			0
asked which he knew better , the cellist said said 93 per cent of the time it was the older music			0
however , when the newer music was later replayed to @entity21 he said he was ' familiar ' with it in 77 per cent of cases			0
doctors are hopeful that they will be able to harness the cellist 's ability to recall music as he recovers from the virus			1
it is thought it may be possible to use music to get him to perform certain tasks - such as taking his medication .			0

@entity6 musician was only able to recognise his brother and carer after being hit by rare virus
but he still plays the cello and can still learn new music
