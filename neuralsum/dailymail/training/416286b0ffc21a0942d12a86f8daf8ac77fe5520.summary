@entity1 boss @entity0 has no doubt the cup upsets of the last few days will provide inspiration for his side in their @entity8 semi-final second leg against @entity9 - but also that @entity9 will now be on red alert about the prospect of becoming the latest giant - killing victims			1
there were some major shocks sprung by lower - league clubs facing @entity17 opposition in the @entity19 fourth round , most notably on saturday when @entity20 won 4 - 2 at @entity21 while @entity23 outfit @entity22 triumphed 2 - 0 at @entity24			1
and @entity0 , whose @entity26 promotion - chasers go into wednesday 's clash against top - flight @entity9 at @entity28 1 - 0 down in the tie , said : ' i read some quotes from @entity20 players saying the friday night game , where @entity34 drew 0 - 0 at home against @entity36 , gave them inspiration and belief , and we are going to try to use the weekend in the same sort of way			1
@entity1 trail @entity9 1 - 0 after the first leg of their @entity8 semi-final @entity46 wheels away after scoring the winning goal at @entity48 several high profile teams lost to lowly opposition in the @entity19 , including @entity21 's shock exit to @entity20 ' but the other side of it is that i think it all will have put @entity9 on high alert - if the first leg did n't already - that if you are not careful , lower - league teams can cause you a problem			1
' @entity0 's men are certainly no strangers to causing cup upsets themselves , the @entity59 having knocked out @entity17 sides in @entity63 and @entity64 on their way to last season 's @entity19 semi-finals , despatching another in @entity68 in the third round this term and seeing off two more in @entity71 and @entity72 during the current @entity8 run			1
and he has every belief those experiences will set @entity36 in good stead for wednesday			0
' we have still got quite a few of the lads from the @entity19 run last year , and the other ones are loving it too , ' @entity0 said			1
' every player and supporter is looking forward to wednesday night			0
' @entity0 also feels big clubs have been taking cup competitions too lightly in general			2
' i do n't think it is even to do with the teams they put out sometimes , ' the 48 - year - old said			2
' i just think with the majority of the lower - league lads being @entity96 and having been brought up with cup traditions , it just probably means a little bit more to them			2
blades boss @entity0 , with @entity100 ( right ) , hopes @entity19 upsets will provide inspiration @entity103 ( left ) celebrates scoring the equaliser in @entity36 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity106 at the weekend ' that is not anything too demeaning with regard to the foreign lads - i just think when you are brought up with it , it is inevitable that you are going to understand its importance a little bit more			1
' @entity36 are currently eighth in the third tier and still in both the main domestic knockout competitions , and @entity0 admits extended cup participation can make things tough in terms of sustaining league momentum			2
but he insists he never wants anything other than victory from a tie - something unquestionably the case on wednesday when the prize is a @entity129 final			0
' it is very difficult to maintain a challenge for promotion while you are still in both cups , without a doubt , ' said @entity0 , whose side drew their @entity19 fourth - round tie at @entity106 1 - 1 on saturday			1
' but when you come to these games , you ca n't say ' it would be better for us to lose today '			0
we do n't want to lose games			0
' people suggested we did n't want a replay ( against @entity106 ) , but we 'd take that rather than be out of the competition any day of the week			0
that is the attitude we have had in all of the cups			0
' @entity149 forced a replay at @entity151 after holding @entity36 to a goalless draw @entity17 champions @entity24 were dumped out of the @entity19 by @entity22 's @entity153 @entity9 will be looking to bounce back on wednesday from their @entity19 elimination at the hands of @entity17 basement boys @entity156 at the weekend , and despite being at home , @entity0 thinks his players may have an even tougher task on their hands this time than they did in the first leg last week			1
' it might be strange - we might have done the easy part , believe it or not , ' @entity0 said			2
' over two legs you get maybe one shot at these teams when they are not quite sure about you , and all the onus , expectation and pressure was on them at @entity48			0
' i think they may be a bit more relaxed at @entity28 , because they have a one - goal lead and the onus is very much on us now to go and create			0
' it will be an unbelievable achievement for the club , as a @entity26 club , to get to the final			0

@entity1 trail @entity9 1 - 0 in their @entity8 semi-final
@entity21 and @entity24 were knocked out of the @entity19 at weekend
@entity0 hopes the @entity59 will take inspiration from giant - killers
