today @entity7 ’s @entity6 ( @entity6 ) confirmed that the meat did come to factories supplying supermarkets in the @entity7 , and said it was trying to establish how much			1
the vast recall came as officials named @entity1 firm @entity13 en @entity14 and @entity15 as those who supplied the meat			1
the @entity19 and @entity18 said 370 different companies around @entity4 and 132 more in the @entity1 were affected by the recall because they bought meat from two @entity1 trading companies			1
beef ... or is it ? today 's news about the dubious meat coming out of @entity26 is the latest of several food scandals the food authority said in a statement that because the exact source of the meat can not be traced ' its safety can not be guaranteed ' , and said the @entity1 authorities had ' no concrete indications that there is a risk to public health '			1
miss @entity37 said the recall covers meat dating back from the very beginning of 2011 up to february 15 this year , when the companies at the heart of the recall were placed under heightened scrutiny and faced criminal investigations			1
she conceded that - because the recall dates back more than two years - some of the meat ' may already have been consumed '			1
the @entity7 @entity6 said : ‘ we have been informed by the @entity1 authorities that a small number of @entity7 businesses may potentially have received products from the company implicated in their investigation			1
' the @entity6 is following up with these businesses as a matter of urgency to determine if they have received products from the @entity1 company			1
’ the suspect shipments began in january 2011 , according to the @entity59			0
a spokesman said : ‘ at this stage , the origin of the meat is unknown but the @entity1 authorities acknowledged that horse meat had been mixed with beef			2
’ other countries known to have bought the affected meat include @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
miss @entity37 said authorities were bound by law to recall the meat if it is unclear where exactly it came from			2
she said : ' if meat has an unclear source then the law - the general food law - says it is no longer fit for human or animal food			2
' @entity1 authorities began a large - scale investigation into the country 's meat industry in february after the horse meat scandal broke across @entity4			2
this afternoon 's shock news is just the latest scandal in a long list concerning the dubious origins of some foodstuffs			0
supermarket giant @entity92 recalled all corned beef from its budget range last month after trace of a horse drug were found yesterday , the @entity6 said that the veterinary painkilling drug phenylbutazone - or bute - had been found in @entity100			1
@entity92 had already withdrawn tens of thousands of its own brand corned beef last month after it was found to contain up to 50 per cent horsemeat			1
the supermarket giant removed the £ 1.54 products from stores across @entity7 on march 8 - and tests this week showed quantities of horse dna above trace levels			1
@entity110 found the ingredients of one batch of the 340g tins were half horse , but @entity115 - based @entity92 has insisted it only found levels of up to five per cent			1
@entity92 , which last month said it had carried out more than 700 tests on products during the horsemeat scandal , has had eight products that have been positive for at least traces of horse			1
a spokesman for @entity92 said the chain has ' taken a belt and braces approach ' to testing for horse dna and quickly removed any products from its shelves ' whenever we 've had any concerns '			1
@entity131 , director of operations at the @entity6 , acknowledged it takes time to test for bute once horsemeat is found in a product			1
speaking on the @entity136 radio 4 today programme , he said : ' what we have found in this positive test result is a very low level of ( bute ) ... which is only really just above the limit of detection			2
' it 's very unlikely to ( do harm )			0
as the chief medical officer has said ... it 's extremely rare people have an adverse reaction to phenylbutazone			0
' this is considerably lower than a therapeutic dose and you would have to consume enormous quantities of meat , way more than anyone could physically consume , to get near a therapeutic dose			2
' mr @entity131 said it was important to understand how the product came to be contaminated and how it came to have bute in it			0
' if someone has done something which is illegal , and not taken due measures to prevent that happening , then they can face sanctions , ' he said			0
' but we need to determine exactly what has happened in this case before we can determine whether that will happen or not - which is true of any of the cases we have seen			0
' supermarket : the @entity174 - owned chain with 500 - plus stores , whose @entity100 is manufactured by @entity69 supplier @entity177 , has also scraped its @entity179 line ( file picture ) the @entity174 - owned chain with 500 - plus stores , whose @entity100 is manufactured by @entity69 supplier @entity177 , has also scraped its @entity179 line			0
@entity4 's horsemeat scandal erupted in january , when testing in @entity186 revealed that some beef products also contained equine dna , and the problems then spread across the continent			0
the scandal ensnared numerous well - known brands , prompting product withdrawals , consumer concerns and government investigations into the region 's complex food - processing chains			0
@entity199 fraud experts will lead the probe into the horsemeat scandal , co-ordinating the response to what ministers have claimed is an international criminal conspiracy			0
in the commons last month , environment secretary @entity206 described the adulteration of food products with horsemeat as a ' criminal conspiracy which covers 23 countries '			0
@entity213 , @entity92 's director responsible for the quality of all the store 's branded products , said : ' i know our customers will be just as concerned about this news as we are			2
even at such a low level , it is totally unacceptable			0
' i can reassure our customers that we are working closely with the @entity6 and our suppliers to deliver a wide ranging and rigorous programme of testing , to be sure that the products we sell are exactly what it says on the label			2
' @entity131 , director of operations at the @entity6 an @entity92 spokesman said : ' we have taken an extremely cautious approach since the very beginning and have carried out more than 700 tests , moving swiftly to remove any products from our shelves whenever we ’ve had the smallest concerns			1
' our commitment to you is to continue to test our products regularly and update you with the very latest news as soon as we can			0
' in march 2013 we withdrew tinned @entity100 ( 340g ) after receiving a positive test for horse dna above the one per cent trace level set by the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			2
' today , 9th april 9 , tests on further batches have shown a positive result for very low levels of horse medication called phenylbutazone , also known as bute , at four parts per billion			0
' the @entity6 has reassured us that the quantities we ’ve found pose a low risk to human health			1
they say : " @entity255 is not allowed to enter the food chain ; however , even if people have eaten products which contain contaminated horse meat , the risk to health is very low			0
" ' although there is a very low health risk , we are recalling this product			0
this simply means that we ask anyone who has tinned @entity100 ( 340g ) in their cupboards at home to bring it back into store for a full refund			0
' the tinned @entity179 ( 340g ) product , also withdrawn in march , has not tested positive for phenylbutazone			0
however as a precaution it is also being recalled as it is made in the same factory			0
' we want you to have complete confidence in the food you buy at @entity92 and we are happy to refund any product you ’re not 100 per cent happy with			2
