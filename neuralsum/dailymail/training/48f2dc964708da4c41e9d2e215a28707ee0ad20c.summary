by @entity1 reporter eating out with friends is more likely to lead to boring and unhealthy food choices because of the ' i 'll have the same as you ' effect , new research revealed last night			2
diners tend to pick similar , though not necessarily identical , menu items as the people they are eating with , said the study			1
and this could mean ditching the diet and any attempt to stick to nutritious or healthy meals for if one person orders dessert then the others will do so too , it added			1
choices : researchers at the @entity24 found diners tend to pick similar , though not necessarily identical , menu items as the people they are eating with but strikingly , the findings also showed just how boring people are because most groups of diners stick to the same kind of meals with little evidence of trying something new or different			1
researcher @entity35 of the department of agricultural and consumer economics at the @entity24 analysed hundreds of orders in a local full service restaurant			1
she found clear themes among individual groups of people on a table where they all order similar but not identical items off the menu			1
for instance , if someone has a meat dish , the others have a meat dish though not necessarily the same one			0
if one has fish , the others may			0
and the same for starters and dessert			0
options : diners may struggle to stick to nutritious or healthy meals as if one person in the group orders dessert then the others will do so too nutrition , calories and other health labelling does not make a difference , she told the journal @entity68			1
if one person goes for a high calorie choice then the others may do so too , she said			0
it suggests that despite going out for a meal , most people are ' less variety seeking ' than they think			2
she said : ' diners wanted to be different from their dining companions , but not too different			0
' diners are happier if another diner orders from the same food category as them			2
' and peer effects may outweigh the effects of nutritional information on food choice			0

researchers at @entity24 found diners pick similar foods to the people they are eating with
this could hinder attempts to stick to healthy meals , study finds
hundreds of orders at full service restaurant were analysed by researchers
