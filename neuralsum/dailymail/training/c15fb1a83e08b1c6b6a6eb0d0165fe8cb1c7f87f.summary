@entity0 experienced the highs and lows of football in @entity5 ' win against his former club @entity6 – setting up one and scoring another before being sent off late on			1
this win will be vital in @entity5 's chances of avoiding relegation this season and their moments of quality proved too much , with two moves which punctured a poor quality affair and punished their opponents			1
the first goal on 51 minutes was a swift , passing move			1
@entity0 played a one - two with @entity20 , whose return pass skilfully slipped in the striker			1
@entity0 committed a defender then passed into @entity24 who took a touch before finishing – the ball hitting @entity27 and looping up agonisingly over @entity28 who had rushed from @entity6 's goal			1

booked : @entity72 referee : @entity81 7 @entity82 : green attendance : 17,785 ( 1,583 ) ratings by @entity85 at @entity35 click here for more from @entity87 a single strike did not look like winning the match but @entity0 finished off his former club by finishing off another fine move with 15 minutes to play			1
this time @entity49 exchanged passes with @entity45 on the right , then cut the ball back to @entity54 who buried a low strike			0
it was a fine display from @entity5 's top scorer , until he was sent off two minutes later			1
already on a yellow card for a late challenge on @entity65 , @entity0 led with an elbow to contest a ball and caught @entity64			1
referee @entity103 did not hesitate to book him again and produce a red			0
manager @entity105 agreed that the two yellow cards were warranted , but added : ' he is not a nasty type of player at all			2
he was trying to defend and put shift in			0
he scored again which is great for us			0
' this fixture at @entity35 last season in the @entity114 was 3 - 3 , described by @entity51 in the match - day programme as a ' ding - dong ' affair			0
a few more displays like this and @entity6 will be back there next season			0
surprisingly , the visitors were the dominant side of the first half and @entity5 relied on goalkeeper @entity44 , extending his fine form of recent weeks , to keep the score level			1
on 12 minutes he was , admittedly , at fault when he dropped @entity129 's cross straight into the path of @entity70 , but his reactions to dive to his left to stop the follow - up effort were lightning			1
he was tested once more just before the half - hour mark			0
the ball came back out from a @entity6 corner to @entity66 , who hit a swerving drive from 25 - yards which was curving into the top right corner until the @entity5 goalkeeper tipped it on to the right post			2
@entity49 battles for the ball with @entity65 in a first half that saw plenty of passion , but little in the way of quality @entity66 , who came closest for @entity6 with a free kick that rattled the post , chases down @entity5 's @entity152 @entity20 goes down under a challenge from @entity6 defender @entity64 as @entity5 looked to continue their good recent home form @entity155 miles @entity5 105.8 65.7 @entity52 90 11.6 7.2 @entity51 90 11.3 7.0 @entity152 90 10.3 6.4 @entity6 112.3 69.8 @entity66 90 12.4 7.7 @entity72 89 11.3 7.0 @entity129 90 10.9 6.8 ' that was top corner all the way , ' @entity105 said			1
' i was behind it and as soon as he hit it i said , “ that 's in			2
” how he got his fingertips to that i do n't know			0
he 's a great keeper			2
you go one down and it takes the momentum away , he kept us in it at 0 - 0			0
' @entity5 suddenly realised they were playing at home to a side who they need to be beating if they want any chance of staying in the top flight			1
@entity49 carved out a chance for himself , running down the right flank and cutting inside before beating @entity28 with a low shot only to see defender @entity64 block on the line			0
as the whistle went for half - time two teams traipsed off who knew how crucial the next 45 minutes could be to defining their season			2
it was @entity105 's side who took the initiative early in the second half with @entity24 's strike , but @entity6 would not lie down			1
six minutes after they went behind , @entity66 flashed a ball across the box from the left - hand side and @entity72 was there at the back post of a tap - in only for @entity196 to stick out a leg and somehow not send the ball into his own net			2
then @entity74 sent a back - post header inches wide of the left post , teed up by a deep cross from the right by @entity69			0
@entity6 manager @entity204 said : ' @entity44 's made a worldy save			2
we need to be more clinical			0
we have been earlier in the season and we were n't enough against @entity5			2
' the performance was good , there was organisation , energy , quality , we 're putting in the right mixture but we need to win games			0
we have to turn that into wins			0
' for all @entity6 's endeavour , the game was finally sealed when @entity0 struck – and only his foolishness late on stopped him fully revelling in the victory			1
@entity65 runs away from @entity0 as the striker put in an all - action display , scoring @entity5 's second goal before seeing red referee @entity224 has to calm down a dispute between @entity20 and @entity6 goalkeeper @entity28 as players crowd around @entity28 collides with @entity0 as both players compete for a bouncing ball just outside the @entity6 box @entity52 stretches for the ball to poke it away from @entity6 's @entity129 as @entity66 offers support @entity24 is congratulated by @entity54 after giving @entity5 the lead which they never looked like relinquishing against @entity6 @entity0 celebrates scoring for the third home game in a row as @entity5 won their second consecutive game at @entity35 @entity54 is shown the first of his two yellow cards by @entity239 , which would prove costly as the striker now faces a suspension @entity204 shakes hands with @entity105 before the game , but despite their smiles both men knew it was a vital match to win the players line up together before the game to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the @entity251 day truce			1

@entity0 *double* home side 's *advantage* in the 74th minute
