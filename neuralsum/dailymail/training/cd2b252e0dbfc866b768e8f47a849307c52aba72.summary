it gave the nation an unexpected feel - good boost on a sun - drenched saturday and raised expectations that the 19 - year - old may yet make it all the way to the final			1
but five - time champion @entity51 stands in her way			1
the pair are on course to meet in the quarter - final , should they both advance beyond the next round			1

but her elevation to sporting darling leaves a quandary			0
what to call the famous slope at the @entity128 where spectators traditionally gather to raucously cheer their heroes ? when @entity0 is on court there appear to be two competing names : @entity153 and @entity154			2
the former , a light - hearted reference to the actor and singer , appears to be the most popular			2
@entity159 , left , was joined by her fiance @entity160 and fellow gold - winning cyclist @entity135 in the @entity93 however , others argue that @entity154 is a more natural choice because it follows the alliterative tradition of @entity167 and @entity167			1
@entity0 was born in @entity168 , @entity169 , but moved to @entity4 at the age of six			2
her father @entity171 , an oil company executive , sat in the stands but @entity0 mother ’s @entity59 remained at their new home near @entity176 to look after the family ’s two pet labradors			0
