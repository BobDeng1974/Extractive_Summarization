by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 is ‘ hungry for gold ’ and a slice of revenge on saturday after relinquishing his 10m synchronised title to @entity5 but he will have to overcome his own ‘ demon dive ’ as well as his great @entity8 rival if he is to top the podium in the 10m individual event			1
@entity1 and @entity12 were delighted to take silver last night on friday night - missing gold by the equivalent of a misplaced baby toe - having only formed a partnership last week and completed just three training sessions together			1
but if he is to upgrade to gold @entity1 needs to conquer the dreaded ‘ twister ’ dive , which has been his nemesis since @entity22			1
he traced his problems back to the @entity26 final , when his focus was disrupted by a flash from a camera in the crowd			2
@entity1 messed up and was allowed to repeat the dive , going on to win a bronze			1
but it has had him spooked ever since , with one prominent sport psychologist suggesting he might be suffering from ‘ @entity38 ’ syndrome - diving ’s equivalent of the yips			2
after faltering again when performing the dive at a @entity62 event in @entity63 in april , causing him to miss out on a medal , @entity1 admitted it was a ‘ massive problem ’			1
he said : ‘ when you look down , your knees go weak , your legs go to jelly and it ’s terrifying			0
‘ the twister is my nemesis dive and it always will be , i think			0
it ’s one of those things that i really struggle with			0
the more scared you are in that dive , the more detrimental it is			0
i have to go out there and feel as confident as i can			0
it ’s the dive that ’s the weakest on my list at the moment			0
’ @entity1 has reason to be fearful			2
if you said you were n’t scared by somersaulting backwards while twisting your body around with your head spinning just inches from the board , ‘ you ’re either lying or stupid , ’ he quipped			0
@entity1 has enlisted a sport psychologist and had what he termed ‘ trauma therapy ’ in an attempt to conquer his fears			2
dr @entity91 , a sport psychologist , suggested ‘ @entity38 ’ syndrome			0
‘ it tends to affect more of the artistic type of sports such as diving , gymnastics and trampolining where , for some unknown reason , it ’s not uncommon for athletes to be unable to complete their routine which they could normally do with ease , ’ he told the @entity93			0
‘ it tends to manifest itself in freezing			0
it ’s similar to the yips			0
’ falling through the air : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity12 ( left ) produced a near - perfect final dive to secure silver @entity1 was first encouraged to add the dive to his repertoire by former mentor @entity112 , who said he did not regret encouraging him to attempt the ‘ twister ’			1
‘ it ’s mind games and not about your physical ability to do the specific dive , ’ said @entity112 , ‘ all divers go through it			0
what you have is an increased level of anxiety , and the more nervous you get the worse the problem becomes			0
’ @entity1 , 20 , was still the no 1 attraction at @entity126 ’s @entity125 despite the success of the rest of @entity49 ’s diving team , namely @entity130 who won two golds and won silver this week			1
there were ‘ i love @entity1 ’ t - shirts and posters and several young girls screaming for ‘ selfies ’ with their sporting hero			2
the most enthusiastic support came from the front row , behind a @entity143 flag with ‘ @entity1 ’ emblazoned on it in gold lettering			2
@entity1 ’s mother @entity146 , brother @entity147 and boyfriend @entity148 exploded into cheers as he and @entity12 aced their treacherous sixth dive			1
watching on : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) improved their dives as the competition progressed success : the pair are an inexperienced diving duo but managed to rise to the occasion to finish second they were last of the four pairs going into the final round , after ragged dives in the third and fourth rounds			1
the tannoy system reiterated that - according to @entity165 federation rules - only a gold and silver medal would be awarded			1
‘ we knew it before but it made it a bit more dramatic hearing it halfway through , ’ said @entity1			2
against the grain , they nailed the forward four - and - a - half somersault , the hardest dive any pair attempted and dramatically increase their score to 399.54 , just 0.18 behind @entity5 ( left ) and his partner @entity180			1
‘ he ’s won six silvers but that ’s the first @entity165 gold @entity184 has won , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ he ’ll be hungry for another but i ’m hungry , too			0
’ gold : @entity8 @entity5 ( front and @entity189 ( back ) won the @entity165 title			1

@entity1 and @entity12 came agonisingly close to @entity165 gold
a near - perfect final dive secured silver for pair who had been struggling
there were only four pairs in the competition so just two medals awarded
the pair 's total of 399.36 was just 0.18 *shy* of the @entity8 ' total
@entity8 @entity5 and @entity208 claimed gold
@entity1 aims to win gold in saturday 's 10m individual event
he must overcome his ' demon dive ' that has *haunted* him since @entity22
