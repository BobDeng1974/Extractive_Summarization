during his 25 years on @entity1 , @entity0 earned acclaim for humiliating politicians with his scathing interview style			1
but far from hailing the presenter as one of the great tv journalists , the programme ’s new boss claims @entity0 ’s aggressive interrogations ‘ did n’t produce any real enlightenment ’			1
@entity12 , 46 , who took over as editor of the current affairs programme last september , also branded him ‘ petulant ’ and difficult to work with			2
the segment saw @entity0 call the comedian ‘ trivial ’ and ‘ facetious ’ for claiming voting was pointless			2
mr @entity12 , former deputy editor of @entity25 , said such scepticism towards his ideas was common from @entity0			1
‘ i ’d love to know if he was less petulant in meetings before i got there , ’ he said			0
‘ i think that ’s just his modus operandi			0
‘ he ’s dyspeptic about pretty much everything			0
' almost everything you suggest @entity0 will think is “ preposterous ” or “ infantile ” or an otherwise “ completely lamentable ” idea , and that ’s a challenge because you have to sell it to him			2
’ fearsome : @entity0 , above , left producers feeling ' terrified ' , claims @entity1 boss @entity12 as a result , he says , the programme ’s producers were ‘ pretty terrified ’ of @entity0			1

tv presenter left producers ' terrified ' , according to producer @entity12
interviewer ' swore ' at boss but his ' withering looks ' said to be more *effective*
@entity0 criticised programme ideas and ' *snarled* ' his way through meetings
often asked in interview *briefings* : ' why are we doing this *bloody* interview ? '
but he conceded that the ' thrilling ' presenter made politics more interesting
