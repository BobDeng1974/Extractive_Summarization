a 20 - year - old woman who had a rare genetic disorder that kept her looking like a toddler has died			2
@entity5 remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler , with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year			1
she died last week and her cause of death remains unknown			2
20 years old : despite her increasing age , @entity5 remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler , with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year			1
she died last week medical marvel : during her 20 years , @entity5 ( seen here at left with her younger sister @entity15 ) overcame a number of health issues that were resolved without doctor 's knowing what had happened ' while the outside world may have noticed @entity5 ’s physical stature and been puzzled by her unique development state , she brought joy and love to her family , ' rabbi @entity20 said during his eulogy , according to the @entity28			1
' her parents , three sisters and extended family showered her with love and respected her dignity throughout her entire life			0
' in january of this year , @entity5 and her family - including her 17 - year - old sister - made an appearance on @entity39 's talk show			1
they told how she is unable to talk , still has her baby teeth and like any infant , travels in a push chair - but doctors have never been able to explain why			2
her father , @entity45 , explained : ' from age one to four , @entity5 changed			1
she got a little bit bigger			0
but age four , four to five , she stopped			0
' family : @entity5 , then 16 , with her parents , her younger sister @entity15 , then 13 ( second left ) and their older sister @entity51 , then 19 ( left )			1
while her sisters developed normally , @entity5 stayed the size of a toddler supportive family : @entity5 appeared in january on @entity39 with her mother @entity57 , father @entity45 and 17 - year - old sister , @entity15 she has been examined by some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the @entity61 , however no formal diagnosis for @entity5 ’s condition has been given , leading doctors to term her condition @entity5 dr @entity65 , director of the @entity66 at @entity67 in @entity68 , explained that she has ' no apparent abnormalities in her endocrine system , no gross chromosomal abnormalities , or any of the other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental issues			1
' @entity5 stayed the same size for 15 years and required 24 - hour care from her parents			1
she is fed through a tube inserted into her stomach , because her oesophagus is so small that swallowed food could back up into her lungs and cause pneumonia			0
her mother , @entity84 , said : ' it 's been 16 years of on the job training , giving her medicine , knowing when she 's sick , knowing the right amount			2
' @entity89 love : tests have shown that @entity5 , who is three years older than her sister , may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature happy : the family said that they knew it was difficult for outsiders to understand @entity5 - since even some of the world 's best doctors did n't have a clue shopping trip : @entity5 , who stopped growing at age four to five , stayed the same size for 15 years and required 24 - hour care from her parents mr @entity45 added : ' the key with @entity5 is we do n't know what tomorrow brings			1
' scientists believe her unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of aging , leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age , such as @entity118 's			2
tests have shown that @entity5 , who was born in 1993 , may have suffered from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature			1
one of the factors that was the most difficult for doctors to diagnose was the fact that she had no obvious causes from a genetic standpoint			2
a leading genetics expert reported that there were ' no apparent abnormalities in her endocrine system , no gross chromosomal abnormalities , or any of the other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental issues			0
' in spite of that , @entity5 stayed the same size for 15 years			1
much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another			0
' @entity148 parts of her body , rather than all being at the same stage , seem to be disconnected , ' dr. @entity145 of the @entity146 said in 2009			0
when her condition was profiled by @entity151 when she was 8 - years - old in 2001 , she weighed about 13 pounds which is standard for children at about six months old			2
she stayed about the same weight for many years after that , but in 2009 dr @entity145 reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9 - month - old child			0
dr @entity65 is in the process of sequencing @entity5 ’s genome , which is comprised of two long strings of letters , one from the mother and one from the father			1
each string is three billion letters long , and changes in just one of these letters can lead to profound effects on development , physical appearance , and risk of disease			0
according to @entity177 , in the first six years of her life , @entity5 suffered series of medical emergencies from which she recovered , often without explanation			1
she survived surgery for seven perforated stomach ulcers , and suffered a brain seizure followed by a stroke that weeks later left no apparent damage			0
then at age four , she fell into a coma that caused her to sleep for 14 days			0
doctors diagnosed a brain tumor , which disappeared by the time she awoke			0
dr @entity65 hopes to find out whether any abnormal genes identified in @entity5 ' are involved in aging related processes , whether manipulating these genes could increase longevity and / or reduce aging related disorders such as @entity197 ’s , heart disease and many forms of cancer , ' he said			1
mrs @entity5 , who said during the @entity39 appearance that she loves @entity202 the way she is , explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her how old @entity5 is , she usually does n't answer truthfully			1
' my system always has been to turn years into months			0
so , if someone asked today , i might say , she 's [ 20 ] months old , ' she said			0
many doctors examined @entity5 during her life , and one of the most shocking discoveries was that none of her genomes were distinctly abnormal			1
mother and daughter : mrs @entity5 , who said she loved @entity202 the way she was , explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her how old @entity5 is , she usually does n't answer truthfully key to aging : scientists believe @entity5 's unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of ageing , leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age , such as @entity118 's instead , much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another			1
' @entity148 parts of her body , rather than all being at the same stage , seem to be disconnected , ' dr. @entity145 of the @entity146 said in 2009			0
one of the clearest examples of this is based on the fact that her brain was believed to have developed past different parts of her body			0
when her condition was profiled by @entity151 when she was 8 - years - old in 2001 , she weighed about 13 pounds which is standard for children at about six months old			2
she stayed about the same weight for many years after that , but in 2009 dr @entity145 reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9 - month - old child			0
@entity5 's case , while extremely rare , is not believed to be the only one of it 's kind			2
there are two other clear examples of individuals with very similar situations , though none of them have been categorically solved .			0

@entity5 remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler in spite of being born in 1993
she passed away last week *due* to *undisclosed* causes
no formal diagnosis for @entity5 ’s condition has ever been given , leading doctors to term her condition @entity5
doctors think a possible gene mutation may have switched off her ability to mature and have been studying her genomes for years
