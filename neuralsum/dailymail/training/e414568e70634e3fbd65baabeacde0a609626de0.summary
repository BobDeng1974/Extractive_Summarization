by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has warned his title rivals that he is building another @entity5 empire fit to last for up to a decade at the top			1
@entity2 has been thrilled with the impact of his £ 75million trio of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 and the way they have responded to his demands in pre-season , adding to the feeling his may be the team to beat in the title race			1
‘ we have the squad that we want to have , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we do n’t say it ’s perfect , we do n’t say it ’s the best			0
there is no manager in the world that says his squad is perfect and could not improve in certain positions			2
‘ we say we like very much our squad			2
it is a squad for tomorrow , for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people			1
so , i like my squad very much			2
’ drive : @entity51 @entity10 will add energy and direction to the @entity5 midfield @entity2 applauded the @entity56 board for striking fast to fulfil his requests in the transfer market			1
‘ i love the club because the club was fantastic and gave me the three targets i was asking for , in the left back , a midfield player and a striker , ’ he said			0
‘ in fact , they gave me two strikers because @entity35 is also back			0
‘ we have bought three people in @entity68 , @entity9 and @entity10 , all in the best stage for a football player , between 25 and 30			1
they are three experienced players with quality to strengthen immediately our team			2
last season we went into the season with a different profile when we bought people like @entity77 and @entity78 ; people that needed some time			0
we also went to people like @entity81 , but these players — @entity83 — are ready			0
‘ the squad improves , for sure , and the team can show qualities on the pitch that in the past we did n’t			1
the team has to be better			2
but obviously , this is the @entity89 and every team tries to be better , especially at the top			1
influence : left back @entity11 will add valuable experience to @entity2 's squad ‘ are we ready for that ? yes we are but this is @entity97			1
in other countries the title race is between two teams and sometimes only one			1
here it is between five or six			0
’ @entity5 ’s summer recruitment drive has been offset by the sale of @entity105 and @entity106 , just as their moves in january for @entity108 , @entity77 and @entity81 was offset by the sale of @entity110 and @entity111			1
it is dividend for their policy to buy younger players with a sell - on value , in line with @entity119 ’s @entity120 rules			0
even if that policy cost them a few trophies in the past couple of years , @entity2 has been able to raise funds for his rebuilding programme			1
special one : @entity2 hopes to get the best out of @entity130 this season @entity5 our biggest danger - @entity131 when @entity5 beat @entity133 on tuesday in their final pre-season friendly before they start the @entity89 campaign at @entity136 , they had the look of a vintage @entity2 team , akin to the one he assembled at @entity5 10 years ago and which lasted the best part of a decade			1
it looked well - balanced , with a ruthless physical presence			0
there was a giant goalkeeper , two big centre halves , the giant @entity108 prowling midfield , flanked by the energy of @entity10 and @entity148 , with the muscle and goal threat of @entity9 up front			1
this framework , @entity2 hopes , will get the best from @entity130 , @entity78 and @entity154			2
if there is a weakness , they are vulnerable should @entity9 or @entity108 be ruled out long - term , for any reason			1
there is also a shortage of homegrown players , which limits their scope to sign any more foreign players , even if they wanted to			0
@entity2 ruled out the idea he wanted @entity167 ’s @entity166 centre half @entity168 , valued at £ 30m			2
‘ we ’re not interested , ’ the manager said			0
‘ we have @entity24 , ( @entity172 ) @entity171 , ( @entity174 ) @entity173 and @entity81			0
‘ and we want to make @entity176 step - by - step part of the squad			2
he ’s training with us every day , playing a few minutes with us when it ’s possible , playing in the @entity179 and training with us as a first - team squad member			1
’ @entity81 , signed from @entity182 in january , is 19 but @entity2 plans to keep him at @entity5 as defensive cover rather than loan him out			1
@entity176 is a highly - rated , 18 - year - old @entity184 , who has graduated from the academy like @entity186 , a 19 - year - old @entity187 defender , who impressed at left back against @entity133			0
these teenagers are important to the squad			0
there are 18 senior foreign players for only 17 places in the official @entity89 squad			1
the most obvious omission before the end of the month is either @entity196 or @entity197			0
@entity2 says he will inform his goalkeepers on sunday who will be his no 1 and the other is unlikely to be content to sit on the bench for the entire season			2
@entity203 is at the club as back - up			0
@entity206 , back after a year on loan at @entity208 , could have a role to play as @entity5 try to balance their squad numbers because he was ‘ homegrown ’ , by @entity211			1
‘ we have one problem to resolve , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ we have one extra foreign player in at the moment and @entity206 is not a foreign player			0
‘ @entity206 ’s best position is on the wings where we have many solutions			0
we have @entity130 , @entity219 , @entity77 and @entity78 but he ( @entity206 ) is @entity220 and at this moment we have one foreign player who has to leave			0
‘ so until the end of the month we have to make that decision and @entity206 is involved in this process			0
maybe stays or maybe leaves			0
‘ because he is @entity220 , it is something we have to analyse as well			0
’ apart from this minor irritation , it is easy to understand why @entity2 is excited about the season ahead and he has refused to rule @entity35 out of monday ’s game at @entity136 , even though the 36 - year - old striker twisted an ankle in sunday ’s friendly against @entity233			1
‘ i do n’t want to say he ’s ready on monday but with the quality of our medical department and the mentality that he has , i ’m not saying it is impossible for him to recover , ’ said @entity2 .			2

@entity2 feels @entity5 are team to beat in @entity89 title race
