by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 in custody : @entity4 has been arrested on gun charges , but may face more accusations related to the disappearance of @entity8 the stepmother of the 12 - year - old @entity11 boy missing for 11 days until being found in the basement of his father 's home knew he was down there , police have revealed			1
@entity4 barricaded young @entity8 behind boxes and told him ' not to come out , no matter what he hears , ' the boy told police , according to court documents filed after she was arrested thursday			1
prosecutors also revealed the boy 's body is covered in scars from prior abuse , including one sustained from father @entity27 ' driving a pvc pipe into his chest ' as punishment for a transgression , authorities said			1
investigators found a bloody pvc pipe in the home , and ' mr. @entity27 disclosed physically disciplining @entity36 with [ it ] , ' police said			1
blood found on the boy 's clothes has not immediately been explained , but the reportedly abusive father 's lawyer claimed to police it was from eczema			1
' he scratched it like crazy , ' said attorney @entity47			0
the boy , who was found stashed behind ' boxes and totes , ' also claimed his stepmother would not bring him food , according to the @entity53 , which reviewed the court petition			1
' @entity8 reports sneaking upstairs to get food when everyone left the home , ' the filing said			1
a separate petition filed in juvenile court further detailed the boy 's treatment in the house of horrors			1
the storage closet is to the right , and the exit door , which was oddly left open is further down the corridor hiding out : this is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed @entity8 hid out during the eleven days he was missing found : @entity8 was found hiding in his father 's basement after he 'd been missing for 11 days @entity8 's grandmother told the @entity85 ' he was very skinny , and almost looked like a cancer patient			1
he had marks all over his arms and chest ' the last time she saw him			0
' these latest developments led authorities to remove the couple 's two younger children from their care and place them into protective custody			1
since his discovery , @entity8 ’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges , her two younger children have been taken into care and @entity102 has not been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his mother			1
there have been suggestions that abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance			2
his father has angrily denied the claims , calling them , ‘ absurd ’			2
but neighbors in the upmarket condo building close to downtown @entity11 have said they believe @entity8 simply ran away and used the tunnel to come and go as he pleased			2
one neighbor even said the home - schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried out their desperate search			1
missing : the townhouse in @entity11 where @entity8 was found alive on june 25 escape : the door at the end of the tunnel - at the bottom of the stairs - was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster			1
that means @entity8 could have come and gone as he pleased			0
it is usually locked from the outside one neighbor even said the home - schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried out their desperate search			2
@entity145 was granted exclusive access to the long corridor that joins all the condos and leads to the outside world			0
the outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men , but last week it was apparently left open so residents could get rid of a build - up of trash in a dumpster left outside			2
that means @entity8 could have left the property in the day , before returning at night			0
that would explain why @entity85 agents with search dogs could not find the boy during their exhaustive searches			2
there is also a communal storage space – seen in our pictures – where neighbors believe he could have easily hidden			0
there is even an accessible bathroom in the tunnel			0
dad under fire : @entity173 leaves the @entity174 on friday after a court hearing for his wife , @entity4 - @entity27 speaking to @entity145 , the neighbor , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ as far as i am concerned this kid ran away , then he was found and that ’s it			1
‘ he ran away two years ago , that has been in the news , so it does n’t take a genius to work out that the most obvious explanation here is that he ran away again			0
‘ i have heard he was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one occasion			0
the door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster			0
that means he could have come and gone as he pleased			0
‘ in my opinion he was going out in the day , messing around , eating and then coming back to stay in the corridor or in his basement at night			2
there is even a bathroom down there for him to use			0
a place to hide : @entity8 probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities - and the outside ’ he could have lasted down there for as long as he wanted			2
i do n’t know his parents that well , but they seemed like nice people to me			0
’ despite the neighbor ’s assertions , there is still a significant amount of suspicion surrounding @entity8 ’s parents , with many suggesting he would not have been able to stay hidden without an adult ’s involvement			0
stepmom @entity4 was arrested on thursday after apparently violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge			2
authorities had obtained a warrant for @entity229 's arrest on monday , but held out until thursday to take her into custody later claiming the search for @entity8 took priority			2
relief : @entity8 was able to use a toilet located in the tunnel the 37 - year - old had pleaded guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit earlier this year and had been put on a two - year probation period			1
she was in court today on the gun charge and released on a $ 5,000 personal bond and ordered to wear a monitoring device			0
arrest : @entity4 is arraigned for a probation violation of weapons charges at @entity248 in @entity11 on friday , two days after her stepson was found in her basement back with mom : @entity8 is now staying with his birth mother sources have suggested that @entity102 , a registered nurse , is a strict disciplinarian , who made @entity8 follow strict education and workout schedules			1
@entity256 news reported that @entity8 was made to complete 4,000 strides on an elliptical trainer without break , possibly on a daily basis			0
the day of his disappearance he took a break from his routine and his stepmother reported him to his dad , @entity256 reported			2
@entity8 was reportedly afraid of his father ’s reaction and decided to run away			0
police sources told @entity269 that @entity102 allegedly beat his son with a pvc pipe			1
blood was reportedly found in the boy 's room			1
following his disappearance on june 14th , @entity102 and @entity8 ’s biological mother @entity276 who lives around two miles away both made emotional television pleas for their boy ’s safe return			2
apparently @entity8 would split his time between his father ’s and his mother ’s homes			2
stunned : @entity27 was shocked into silence on wednesday when @entity289 's @entity288 told him his 12 - year - old son had been found alive in his basement , 11 days after he vanished @entity102 was on live television on @entity289 with @entity288 on wednesday when he learned that his son had been found in the home 's basement			1
' we 're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement , ' @entity288 said			1
as the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news - grabbing his chest and looking stunned - @entity288 demanded to know whether or not he had checked his basement			1
' i checked my basement , ' @entity27 said			0
' the @entity85 checked my basement			0
the police checked my basement			2
my wife checked my basement			0
i 've been down there several times			0
we 've all been checking			0
' he said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement , but the boy had not been found			1
@entity11 police chief @entity313 said when police found the boy , he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did not announce himself			1
@entity313 said that he believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier himself			0
he was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found nearby			0
overwhelmed : @entity27 clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found ' there 's no way he could have erected this make - shift area of concealment , i 'll call it , ' @entity313 told @entity269			1
' he certainly was excited to see us			0
i had a chance to actually talk to and embrace @entity8			0
' he indicated he was hungry			0
' @entity313 told reporters earlier wednesday that the boy 's father had taken a polygraph test about his son 's disappearance , but the boy 's stepmother declined to do so			1
mr @entity27 's test came back inconclusive , @entity339 reported			0
he also told authorities that @entity8 had ran away from home two years ago , but police found him after three hours @entity27 , who was last seen when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom , was discovered as authorities searched the home			1
