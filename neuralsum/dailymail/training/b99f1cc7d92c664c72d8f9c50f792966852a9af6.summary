' @entity3 was at the wheel of her @entity73 when she crashed into the cyclist on september 16 last year			1

accused : @entity3 outside court where she is standing trial accused of causing death by dangerous driving			1
she has already admitted the less serious charge of causing death by careless driving ' it was zoomed in			1
i could only see the road but nothing more ... i wanted to see the entire road on the screen to see which way it was sending me			0
i glanced at it for milliseconds			0
' @entity3 said she pressed the zoom out button and ' looked straight back at the road '			1
she then ' glanced ' back at the satnav and realised it had n't zoomed out enough			0
' it was always at different zoom levels at different times			0
the children when the car was parked often fiddled with the satnav so it could be anything , ' she explained			0
' i pressed the zoom out button again			0
i looked down to press the button and looked straight up			0
' @entity3 then suddenly burst into tears as her defence barrister @entity181 continued : ' had you seen the cyclist before ? ' ' no , i had n't , ' she replied , adding : ' he was on his bicycle			2
he was on it , but i did n't see anything else			0
