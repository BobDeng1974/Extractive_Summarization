it ’s a tentative anchors away for the world ’s first floating start - up as more than 250 companies have expressed interest in joining @entity5 , a massive ship anchored in international waters off the coast of @entity10 ’s @entity9			1
the concept of the visa - free metropolis is simple – allow entrepreneurs from any country to do business near @entity9 , even if they can not acquire a @entity19 visa			1
@entity5 says that start - ups from 52 different countries are expressing interest , a positive sign in getting the conceptual ship out into the open			1
@entity5 will charge around $ 1,600 monthly rent , and requires a cut of around 6.5per cent of company shares			1
while the massive ship offers hope for entrepreneurs wanting to do business in @entity19 , there is still little momentum for so - called start - up visas , which would allow those whose businesses earn more than $ 100,000 in venture capital to stay in the country indefinitely			1
the company ’s website states that only a passport is needed to live and work aboard the vessel , and that it will collect no taxes			1
' a lot of people say , " i 'd like to go to @entity9 " but there is no way for them to do it , ' said @entity68 , @entity5 ceo and co-founder , told the @entity70 in an interview earlier this year			1
@entity68 , the son of @entity73 immigrants , thought of the ship after listening to international classmates of his at the @entity77 business school lament about having to leave the @entity19 after graduation			1
politicians have wrangled with the issue , but efforts to change the system have stalled			0
a life on the ocean waves : another proposed design for @entity5 's floating start - up city , apparently modelled on a huge container ship live to work ? this third artist 's impression shows how luxurious live - work units would sit along side container storage areas and a helipad residents would be ferried ashore with temporary business or tourist visas , which are easier to get , to meet with investors , collaborators , partners and others			1
mr @entity100 said the ability to have face - to - face meetings can not be underestimated when trying to gain trust - and secure funds - from investors			2
' yes , we live in an interconnected age with @entity106 and other video conferencing			0
but if you want to grow a company , physical interactions are of paramount importance , ' mr @entity100 said			0
' we 're a startup			0
some people said if you 're not within a 20 mile radius , we wo n't talk to you			0
' the proximity to high - tech 's center , @entity9 , is also important			2
' the talent , the money , the expertise and a cultural acceptance of risk			0
elsewhere if it does n't work out , you 're a black sheep and the funds dry up , ' mr @entity100 said			0
the ship would be a remodeled cruise ship or barge that blueseed leases or owns			2
it would have all the high - tech amenities expected of a start - up incubator and the look of employee - friendly @entity137 giants @entity138 and @entity139 , famous for their modern campuses complete with gourmet cafeterias , exercise facilities and an environmentally - sustainable design			2
a live - work space would cost about $ 1,200 a month			2
@entity145 : more than ever , technology entrepreneurs are choosing the urban charms of @entity32 over the sprawl of neighboring @entity9 ; @entity5 's ceo hopes talent will also be drawn to their ship logistical support , including food and other supplies , would come from local businesses along the coast , helping the economies of @entity158 and @entity32 , though it has n't been determined exactly which port @entity5 would use			1
a helicopter would also be available for emergencies			0
critics deride the ship as a publicity stunt , and say investors would be better served contributing to ventures that help @entity19 create businesses			2
' i would say the whole thing is a perfect metaphor for how in corporate @entity19 the practice to grow talent and incubate business locally is drifting away - quite literally , ' said @entity174 , of the @entity175 , which advocates for limited immigration			1
but supporters of foreign entrepreneurship say immigrants are responsible for some of the most successful businesses in the world and if the @entity19 does n't try to attract them , others will			0
' the ship may sound like a crazy idea but it illustrates how seriously flawed the immigration system here is , ' said @entity188 , who runs @entity189 , which advocates for immigration reform			2
the organization published a report in june that said 40 percent of @entity195 companies were founded by immigrants or their children			2
@entity188 said countries including @entity199 , @entity200 and the @entity36 have programs to attract immigrant entrepreneurs			0
' while the @entity19 is driving people away , other countries are welcoming them with open arms , ' he said			0
' if you miss out on them , you miss their talent , their ideas and ultimately the jobs that they create and the taxes that they pay			0
' vision for the future : @entity5 founders @entity100 , left , and @entity68 , right , stand on the pier at @entity32			1
they hope to raise between some $ 30million to fund their ambitious scheme , with the launch planned for late 2013 @entity223 , a spokesman with the @entity224 , said the agency has not seen the proposal and it 's premature to comment			0
maritime experts say such an idea is feasible , but very costly			0
' a good single point mooring costs in the millions of dollars but it could restrain a ship - shape vessel in quite severe storms and in deep water , ' said @entity235 , ceo of @entity237 - based @entity236 , an engineering consultancy specialising in offshore and marine structures			1
' but it would be prudent if the vessel had its own propulsion if you had a @entity245 hurricane come along , ' @entity235 added			0
@entity5 's idea has started gaining steam			1
@entity9 investor @entity248 , a founder of @entity250 , announced he would lead @entity5 's financing search			1
mr @entity248 has been a big supporter of ' seasteads ' - self - ruling cities on the ocean - and both mr @entity68 and mr @entity100 worked at the @entity255			0
@entity5 wants to raise $ 10million to $ 30million over the next year and a half			1
the goal would be to launch in late 2013 .			0
