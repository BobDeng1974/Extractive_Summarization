' @entity39 were given a rather tougher draw pitted against holders @entity41			2
revenge : @entity10 sporting director @entity28 believes his team can get a difficult result this time round @entity41 may be a daunting prospect for @entity47 ' side , but @entity39 beat the @entity49 giants 5 - 0 on aggregate in 2009 including a 4 - 0 hammering at @entity51			1

' so i think we are in great shape and will keep developing and improving			0
' he added : ' if you look at @entity39 as a football club this is our competition , we 've won it five times and to play someone who has won it 10 times makes it extra special			2

' @entity114 wary of ' easy ' tag re-match : @entity117 , now departed from @entity98 , scored twice at the @entity118 last season achievable : @entity93 hit back in @entity11 and managed to get out of their group in second place last year @entity123 were given the toughest task of the @entity8 teams , facing @entity11 giants @entity126 and @entity129 runners up @entity130			2
