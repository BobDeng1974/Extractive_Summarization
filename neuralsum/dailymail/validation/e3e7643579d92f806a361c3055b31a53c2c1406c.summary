secretary of state @entity0 spent five minutes of a @entity2 hearing excoriating a group of 47 republicans who sent a highly unusual letter to the government of @entity7 warning that @entity8 could modify the terms of any nuclear deal it negotiates with the @entity12			1
' this letter raises questions of judgment and policy , ' he insisted , before @entity18 @entity17 sen. @entity17 cut him off and scolded him for delivering ' a well - written speech			0
' ' it 's not a speech ! this is not a speech ! ' @entity0 erupted			2
' this is a statement about the impact of this irresponsible letter			0
the letter does not have legal authority , and i think you have to ask what people are trying to accomplish			0
' @entity0 later staked out a position that lawmakers have no standing to change any nuclear agreement between the @entity37 and @entity7 because it wo n't be ' legally binding ' in the first place			1
' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it the capacity for enforcement			2
we do n't even have diplomatic relations with @entity7 right now			0
' he blamed @entity71 @entity70 sen. @entity70 and 46 other @entity73 senators for signing a letter on monday that ' ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of @entity37 foreign policy			2
' @entity0 , @entity37 's top diplomat and the @entity82 administration 's senior @entity80 negotiator , said he reacted with ' utter disbelief ' to the letter , which also warned @entity7 's leaders that an accord with president @entity82 's team could expire the day he leaves office			1
the letter itself is an unprecedented intervention by @entity8 into negotiations with a foreign power , @entity0 suggested			1
' during my 29 years in the @entity2 i never heard of , or even heard of it being proposed , anything comparable to this , ' he said			0
' this letter ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of @entity37 foreign policy			2
' ' when it says that @entity8 could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time is flat wrong , ' said @entity0 , who once chaired the committ he addressed on wednedsay			1
' you do n't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders of a country			2
' @entity70 , a freshman senator , does not sit on the @entity114 panel			0
the administration has been forced into a no - win situation in the @entity51 , with the so - called ' @entity117 ' gaining territory in @entity119 while the @entity7 help push them back			0
' they want us to destroy @entity122			2
they want to destroy @entity122 , ' @entity0 said during an exchange with @entity126 @entity125 sen. @entity125			1
' @entity122 is a threat to them , ' he said of @entity7			2
' it is a threat to the region			0
i think you are misreading it if you think there is not a mutual interest			0
' @entity0 claimed the @entity37 has ' the capacity ' to ' knock out @entity122 ' on its own , but ' we 're not going to get suckered into that			1
' ' the enduring transformation that has to take place here is not going to take place if the @entity37 just comes in and were to knock out @entity122 and that ’s it – go away , ' he said , adding that it 's ' not gon na happen			1
' but @entity70 's letter , also signed by senate majority leader @entity145 and several @entity73 presidential hopefuls , was exhibit a on wednesday			0
formal treaties require ratification by two - thirds of the @entity2 , but ' the vast majority of international arrangements and agreements do not , ' @entity0 said			2
' and around the world today we have all kinds of executive agreements that we deal with , ' including ' any number of noncontroversial , broadly supported foreign policy goals			0
' start of it all : @entity71 freshman senator @entity70 wrote a letter to @entity7 's leaders and persuaded 46 other republicans in the @entity2 to sign it with him the @entity82 administration and @entity2 @entity164 have harshly condemned @entity70 's letter , which was presented to leaders of the @entity168 republic as a primer on the @entity37 @entity170			0
it warned that ' the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time			1
' as @entity0 's turn on the hot seat began , protesters from the liberal anti-war group @entity47 interrupted – as they have done in other recent hearings			1
like @entity185 sen. @entity184 , who last month called them ' low - life scum ' as they were led out of a hearing room , @entity0 fired back at a woman who shouted repeatedly that ' the @entity37 is killing innocent civilians with drones ! ' ' killing more innocent people ? ' he asked aloud			1
' i wonder how our journalists , who were beheaded , and a pilot who was fighting for freedom – burned alive – what they would have to say to their efforts to protect innocent people			0
' enemy of my enemy : @entity126 sen. @entity125 heard @entity0 say that @entity7 is helpful in fighting the @entity122 terror army the secretary of state will meet @entity7 's foreign minister , @entity205 , next week in @entity206 for another round of talks			1
he said @entity70 's letter ' erroneously asserts that this is a legally binding plan			1
it 's not , that 's number one			0
' ' number two , it 's incorrect when it says that @entity8 could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time			1
that 's flat wrong , ' he continued			0
' they do n't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders			0
' neither the @entity37 nor @entity7 has emphasized the need for a legally binding deal because each has stronger forms of leverage			1
if @entity7 cheats , the @entity82 administration has spoken of re-imposing suspended sanctions			0
the @entity37 has also held out the prospect of military action if @entity7 makes progress toward a nuclear weapon			1
similarly , if the @entity37 does n't live up to its side of the bargain , the @entity7 can ramp up enrichment levels of uranium , taking them closer to nuclear weapons capacity			1
@entity8 , too , wields a threat : new forms of economic punishment of @entity7 that would be forbidden in the agreement			1
but such a move would almost surely require overriding a presidential veto and could pin any diplomatic collapse on the @entity37			0
negotiators from the @entity37 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 hope to seal a framework with @entity7 by month 's end and a comprehensive agreement by july			1
@entity0 scoffed at the notion that @entity82 's successor would discard a deal reached between so many powerful governments and adhered to by @entity7			1
' i 'd like to see the next president , if all of those countries have said this is good and it 's working , turn around and just nullify it on behalf of the @entity37 , ' he said			0
' that 's not going to happen			0
' ready to make history : @entity0 shook hands with new defense secretary @entity272 ( left ) as protesters anticipated the start of wednesday 's hearing questions about the process involved in any agreement with @entity279 - majority @entity7 are sensitive for a variety of reasons			1
@entity282 , @entity285 @entity284 countries and many @entity37 lawmakers are concerned that international negotiators could be placing too much trust in @entity7			0
the prospects of a ' nonbinding ' pact will hardly alleviate their concerns , even if none of them have professed faith in @entity7 abiding by the terms of an agreement that would ease sanctions in exchange for at least a decade of strict limits on the @entity7 nuclear program			2
@entity7 says its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research purposes			0
on tuesday , @entity305 , @entity0 's spokeswoman , raised the possibility of the deal assuming legal character through the @entity309			2
@entity305 did n't speak definitively on the matter but cited the example of a 2013 strategy agreed to between the @entity37 and @entity254 on @entity313 relinquishing its chemical weapons stockpile			2
that plan was then endorsed by the @entity317 ' top body			0
' this framework was not legally binding and was not subject to congressional approval , ' @entity305 told reporters during a daily press briefing			1
' it outlined steps for eliminating @entity313 's chemical weapons and helped lay the groundwork for successful multilateral efforts to move forward			0
' in that case , she added , the @entity37 - @entity254 agreement ' went to the @entity317 to the @entity309 vote			2
' @entity205 is the only one who has gone on record saying such a model would be followed with a nuclear deal			1
@entity37 negotiators have been more circumspect			0
making such a declaration would amount to telling @entity8 that it wo n't have a say on the accord , because it is not a treaty , but that the @entity317 will .			1

secretary of state testified before the @entity64
insisted @entity8 ca n't have a say in the terms of a nuclear deal with @entity80 because the agreement wo n't be ' legally binding ' in the first place
' @entity47 ' protesters interrupted him but this time he fired back at them
@entity0 also claimed that the @entity37 has ' the capacity ' to ' knock out @entity122 , ' but ' we 're not going to get suckered into that '
