@entity14 and @entity15 with their daughters @entity13 , 19 , and @entity18 , 3 , described how @entity19 told them to welcome the siblings into their home and said taking the leap of faith was ' so worth it			1
' however , @entity14 explained on wednesday 's show that he took some time to come around to the idea , as he was initially terrified by the financial burden bringing another five children into his home would create			1
' i am very practical and logical so i had to process through all of that and the enormous responsibility of that			0
' he said he was praying at church on @entity46 , when it became clear they had to be the ones to give these kids a better life			0
' at that moment i felt like @entity19 turned the intercom button on and said you know " i did n't ask you about the kids , i asked if you were willing , " ' he said			0
' it was that moment i could n't choose comfort over			0
. these kids just wanted parents			0
and instead of choosing comfort i chose to do that			0
' worth it : @entity14 and @entity15 , pictured second and third from left , described how @entity19 told them to welcome the children into their home and said taking the leap of faith was ' so worth it ' religious : @entity14 , pictured left with @entity15 and their daughter @entity18 , said he was praying at church on @entity46 , when it became clear they had to be the ones to give these kids a better life @entity78 , 17 , @entity79 , 15 , @entity80 , 12 , @entity81 , 11 , and @entity82 , nine , touched down in december , after an adoption process that lasted a year - and - a - half			1
the children said on @entity8 that they were enjoying school , and becoming accustomed to life in the states , where they recently saw snow for the first time			2
@entity14 said the language barrier had been interesting , but the kids ' @entity91 was very good and improving rapidly			1
' it 's been funny and very interesting at times , ' he said			2
' like they called the other day and he said ' i have hungry ' or they will say ' i am boring ' instead of ' i am bored ' so it has been interesting , it 's been fun			2
settling in : @entity14 said the language barrier had been interesting , but the kids ' @entity91 was very good and improving rapidly school : the children said they were enjoying school in their new town of @entity106 , @entity3 ' the kids really know a lot more @entity108			1
i do n't know @entity111 and they can understand me , it 's just when they 're nervous they do n't like to make a mistake by talking back in @entity91			1
' the family are moving to a bigger home in a few weeks to better accommodate their new family , which more than doubled in size after the siblings sent them an email imploring : ' we need a mommy and daddy ' more than two years ago			1
@entity14 said despite the cost , he does n't regret the family 's decision for a second			1
' i can just say when @entity19 asks you to do something it 's so worth it , ' he said on @entity8			2
' there 's nothing that compares to it			2
the first time we saw the kids at the orphanage they came running from off in the distance , about 50 yards and jumped up in our arms			2
even after two months that we 've had them now , it feels like they 've always been ours			0
' no regrets : @entity14 , pictured center with two of his daughters , said despite the cost , he does n't regret the family 's decision for a second thrilled : @entity14 , pictured , was obviously ecstatic when the president of @entity158 in @entity159 stood up to announce $ 500,000 worth of scholarships to the family however , he was obviously ecstatic when the president of @entity158 in @entity159 stood up during the program to announce the scholarships , saying how moved the school was to hear their story			1
' the practical side of me is sighing relief , ' @entity14 said			1
' that is amazing , thanks you so much			0
' the @entity172 's saw their small family expand more than double after they adopted the five orphaned siblings from @entity5 who had sent them an email imploring : ' we need a mommy and daddy			1
' their new children are now settling into school and home life in @entity106 , where they saw snow for the first time after arriving down in december			2
before the life - changing move , they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis			2
the children refused to be split up , making adoption seem unlikely			2
new additions : @entity14 and @entity15 ( back ) already had two children , @entity13 , 19 , ( right ) and @entity18 , 3 , when they took in the orphans : @entity78 , 17 , @entity79 , 15 , @entity80 , 12 , @entity81 , 11 , and @entity82 , 9 finally home : the @entity172 brood is pictured in the airport after touching down in @entity3 in december but in january 2011 , they met an @entity202 visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email to send back to his friends in the @entity202			1
when @entity15 and @entity209 received the message , they did n't think too much of it			1
' i remember @entity14 and i looking at that e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were , ' @entity15 , 30 , wrote on her blog			1
' i even thought , " someone rich should adopt them "			0
and then life went on			0
' shortly after , @entity15 took a trip to an orphanage in @entity221 and was devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own daughter had the security of a home			1
then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email			2
' somebody 's got to do it , and why ca n't it be us ? ' @entity15 said to her husband			1
' we may eat a lot of spaghetti			0
i will never buy another $ 100 pair of jeans again , and who cares ? if those are my reasons , it 's just practicality , ' she told @entity242			0
and so they embarked on the year - long battle to bring the children from @entity5 to @entity3 , hitting numerous roadblocks along the way , including missing identification records for the children			1
but over chats on @entity251 and visits to @entity5 , the @entity172 soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own			1
' we got told " no " a lot of times , and by then we were already crazy about these kids , so it was a rough part of the story , ' mrs @entity15 told @entity262			2
' and you had to keep trusting that we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for			0
' old life : the children are pictured chatting with their parents - to - be on @entity251 from their orphanage sticking together : the children had been in the orphanage for seven years after their parents died of @entity271 with the help of members of their church , the @entity172 raised the $ 85,000 needed for the adoptions to bring the children to their new home before @entity279			1
one particularly excited member of the welcoming committee at the airport was 19 - year - old @entity13 , who had not seen her father , stepmother or little sister since they left for @entity5 five weeks prior			1
she said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters			0
' i have n't met them , know the personalities , know who they are , ' she said			0
' i 'm excited about that			0
' the @entity172 returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community , with a stocked kitchen , @entity279 presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children			2
new life : the children are now attending @entity202 schools and their @entity91 is improving all the time @entity305 love : nine - year - old @entity306 holds her new little sister , three - year - old @entity18 ' people painted beds , people framed pictures - people made the girls ' room look like they had lived here for years			1
it was awesome to come home to that , ' @entity15 said			1
they also returned to a garden full of snow , which the youngsters had never seen before			0
life has picked up pace in the @entity172 household			0
@entity14 , 43 , runs a lawn care business , while @entity15 has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time			1
the children 's @entity91 is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages , making for some busy mornings in the home			1
' the sound of life is different , ' @entity15 said			2
' it 's a lot more loud and crazy , and half of it 's in @entity111 , half of it 's in @entity91 , and half of it 's in @entity345			0
but it 's really good			0
there 's a strange peace amidst the chaos			0
' @entity350 : the community rallied around the @entity172 to help them raise enough money for the children moving on : the couple returned home ( pictured ) to new bedrooms , a stocked kitchen and @entity279 present under the tree , organised by members of their church			2
they are now moving to a larger home but life is working out well , and most of that is thanks to the children , @entity15 said			1
pictures over @entity370 show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours			0
' these kids are fabulous			0
they have great attitudes , ' she said			0
' nobody fought me on going back to school the second day			0
everybody was up and ready , showers going on their own			0
so their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier			0
' she added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home , the children 's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet			1
