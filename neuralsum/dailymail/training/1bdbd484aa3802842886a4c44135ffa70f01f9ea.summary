only 23 per cent of those with the same grades from state schools were accepted , however , according to figures seen by the @entity40			1
among the 3,888 white pupils with a grades who applied last year , 28 per cent were offered places , but just 20 per cent of black @entity46 students got in - 13 of 67			1
