by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 2 march 2013 toiling fewer than 40ft under the ocean floor , the men knew that one false pick stroke could be their last			0
with the roar of the sea in their ears , these brave miners were forced to tunnel closer and closer to the surface in their quest for tin			2
stretching for more than a century , the dangerous work to extract metal from seams located under the @entity15 coastline claimed many lives and was only ended by economic concerns			1
gateway to the mines below the sea : the @entity21 in operation in the 1860s			2
from this site a shaft was dug reaching 240 fathoms or 480 yards below the sea and workers could hear the waves crash above their head as they toiled relic of the past : the @entity21 in @entity32 were built in 1815 and closed a century later in 1914			1
pictured is the remains of an engine house today now , the seabed near @entity37 in west @entity15 is to be dredged to capture tin washed out there by the prolific land - based mines which operated nearby			1
but beneath the ocean floor lies a vast labyrinth of tunnels extending more than a mile out to sea			0
the greatest concentration of tin and copper submarine mining in the world is located a few miles from @entity37 , notably the mines of @entity32 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
these run from west to east , and from earliest to most recent			0
the largest of these was @entity50 which was in operation for almost a century during the 1800s , and then assimilated into @entity51 which was one of the last mines in @entity15 to close down in 1990			1
yet the history of coastal mining in @entity15 stretches across the millennia , beginning in the @entity61 , approximately three and a half thousand years ago			1
one of the most important finds substantiating this claim is the discovery at the cliff top @entity65 , near @entity32 , west @entity15 , where 30 pieces of copper and smelted tin , along with axes of high tin content were excavated around this now - dilapidated fortress			1
the ‘ @entity73 ’ drill : deadly rock dust was created by such rock drills , powered by compressed air , before water jets were devised to absorb the lethal floating residue			0
pictured right is a map of the submarine mines at @entity51 , @entity50 and @entity32 more than 60 miles of intersecting tunnels lie beneath the @entity83			1
in @entity85 , a blind miner often helped others navigate when their candles failed further evidence of this rich history is provided by the 4th century bc @entity91 explorer @entity90 who visited the area of @entity37 , or ‘ @entity94 ’ , describing the courteous inhabitants ’ production of tin and its subsequent haul to an island named ‘ @entity100 ’ , believed to be @entity101 near @entity102 , for international trade			1
there is evidence of mining in @entity32 from ancient times , but the first records show a date of 1721			1
the ‘ sett ’ ( area ) of @entity32 includes one of the most picturesque and romantic mines in the area : the @entity21			1
these engine houses are still perched perilously close to the sea upon an outcrop of rocks at the foot of the cliff			0
more striking still is the fact that from this post extends a diagonal shaft reaching down over 240 fathoms or 480 yards below sea level and extending almost the same distance out beneath the @entity83			0
modern submarine mining : the sub-incline shaft allowing access to @entity50 from @entity51			1
it was completed by 1977 and officially opened by the @entity130 in 1980 who braved its descent new mine : a diver plugging the breach at the ¿ 40 backs ¿ area in the 1960s where the sea had infiltrated into the submarine levels of @entity50			1
this was an unprecedented and award - winning engineering feat @entity144 : a steam engine built in 1840 , its claim to fame being that it is the oldest @entity15 mine engine which also has remained in situ , and is to this day operational from the mid 19th century tourists would flock to these crowns and some would even attempt a submarinal descent			1
the most famous of these visitors being the @entity153 and @entity154 – or more appropriately the @entity155 and @entity156 – in 1865 , who were staying at @entity101			0
as technology progressed with the @entity160 , greater depths could be mined as water could be mechanically pumped out in larger quantities than buckets permitted			0
mechanised fans also allowed for ventilation which was always an issue for submarine mining because ventilation shafts could not emerge vertically into air as they could inland			1
@entity50 , nicknamed ‘ @entity169 ’ , made effective use of this technology , becoming a leviathan in the mining industry			1
by 1820 it had submarine mines			2
one of its engines is to this day still ‘ in steam ’ and it can be witnessed by visiting the mine , now a tourist attraction run by the @entity182			0
however , despite this technological progress , conditions were still dangerous and toiling for the miners			0
temperatures rose as miners descended with heat recorded at @entity189 at the deepest levels of 350 fathoms or 700 yards below sea level			0
another fear for submarine miners was of course the incursion of the sea itself			2
at @entity50 lies an infamous level or tunnel known as the ’ 40 backs ’ , named so because it ran a mere 40 feet from the seabed			1
in fact , the tunnel moved even closer to the seabed when miners followed a ‘ lode ’ or vein of ore , veering upwards			2
some miners , known as tributers , would be paid according to the value of the ore they yielded – rather than ‘ tut workers ’ who were paid per fathom plunged – so their profit and danger ran parallel at this point			0
here they could hear the crashing of the waves and the thuds of boulders being thrown around by the power of the currents above			0
eventually the danger outweighed the potential profits , and the place was abandoned			0
in 1919 , however , disaster did strike @entity50			1
the so - called ‘ man engine ’ – essentially an ingenious vacillating rod - lift carrying miners into and out of the lower depths – when fully manned , became crippled and smashed down through its deep shaft , killing thirty - one men and injuring many more			0
rusting now : the @entity233 lift at @entity85 ( left )			0
ponies were sent through this shaft , tail first with legs tied to their bodies due to the shaft ’s narrow width			0
they would remain working under the mine for years			0
pictured right , @entity244 of the derelict machinery before the headgear of @entity247 , @entity51 into the abyss : the @entity249 at @entity85 reaching down almost half a mile at 290 fathoms the tragedy was the death knell of @entity50 mining , and was a substantial factor in its eventual closure in 1930			1
more than two decades prior to this a mine known as @entity85 had become independent and renamed itself to @entity51			1
it outlived its southerly parent becoming very prosperous aided by the enhanced technology that the @entity261 provided			0
in the 1960s @entity51 decided to extend its mining to submarine regions when it was realised that much more valuable tin and copper were waiting out there rather than inland			1
living history : some of the tunnels are now accessible to the public at @entity51 dripping : submarine mining became possible with the advent of mechanised pumps draining the tunnels from the water constantly seeping through the earth @entity51 ’s matrix of tunnels would intersect with those undersea tunnels of @entity50 but first a problem needed remedying : it was discovered that after @entity85 mine had closed , the sea had indeed infiltrated its submarine tunnelling			1
the leak was at the fragile 40 backs area			0
an unprecedented operation involving divers from @entity287 , @entity288 , and a 35 - ton @entity290 vessel , was set in motion to plug the breach			1
this was finally completed in 1969 with a total of 2,500 tons of cement being employed			0
the submarine mines were dry and mining once again began			2
@entity298 : as well as tin , copper and other metals , the mines also yielded arsenic			2
any arsenic in the ore turned into a gas which then flowed into this labyrinth ; there it cooled and solidified into arsenic crystals which could be recovered and sold exposed : a precarious cliff entrance to the submarine labyrinth , or @entity312 ¿ in the local dialect , that lies beyond the waves at @entity85 stunning : the picturesque @entity85 mine overlooking the @entity317 , part of the @entity83			0
this area has recently been designated as a @entity320 along with the @entity321 , @entity322 , and the @entity323 in @entity324 by 1977 @entity51 had tunnelled a sub-incline shaft for good access to these depths , a shaft that was officially opened by @entity130 in1980			2
before this unveiling , her majesty , accompanied by the @entity155 and prince @entity330 , had ventured down the shaft themselves in a similar manner to their forebears			0
despite the wealth of copper , tin and other metals that lay there , @entity51 had to close in 1990 due to the collapse of the global price of tin			1
however , @entity51 now acts as a museum where visitors can not only access the industrial complex above ground but where they can also enter the shafts themselves			2
the submarine mines , however , can not be accessed because they are once more submerged , not with sea water but with land drainage : once the pumps had stopped , rain water gradually made its way down into those deep 60 miles of submarine tunnelling – dormant now but perhaps awaiting a new era of good tin pricing and technology capable of once again exploiting the treasures that lie hundreds of fathoms under the sea			2
furthest west ? the scenic @entity363 just to the west of @entity32 , crowned by a mine chimney			2
until two centuries ago this cape was considered to be the @entity368 s end tourist spot : the @entity21 at @entity32			2
visitors have been flocking to this beauty spot for almost two centuries precarious path : the @entity374 glistening over the @entity83 @entity375 : @entity376 would have been a familiar sight to miners at @entity85 and then geevor from the beginning of the @entity261			0

coastal mining in the region stretches back *3,500* years - and has claimed many lives over the millennia
highest concentration of tin and copper submarine mining in world is near @entity37 at @entity32 , @entity50 and @entity51
@entity50 , in operation for almost a century in 1800s , was assimilated into @entity51 , which closed down in 1990
plan now is to dredge seabed to capture tin washed out there
