a @entity1 woman was been forced to move home from @entity3 after discovering she was recorded as a male on her birth registry - and now claims she is technically locked in an ' illegal gay ’ marriage			1
mother - of - five @entity8 , 49 , says her world has been turned upside down after it came to light the registrar wrongly recorded her as a male when she was born in february 1965			1
mrs @entity8 says when she first noticed the mistake more than a decade ago when she applied for a full - time @entity3 visa she ' laughed it off ' and thought it would be put right straight away - but after years living in the @entity1 unable to move back she has turned to the prime minister for help			1
error : @entity8 , 49 , disocvered in 2003 that she had been registered as male at birth documentation : the details were later amended , but institutions including the @entity3 immigration office have told her the entry is legally binding - meaning she could not extend her visa but she was then told the information could not be altered because it is a legal document - which she claims has made her 23 - year marriage to husband @entity29 , 49 , invalid			1
the family , who were living their dream life in @entity3 , have since been forced to move back to the @entity1 after mrs @entity8 was unable to renew her passport due to the error			1
mrs @entity8 says the cost of the move and the paperwork trying to fight it has cost £ 150,000 - and the only person left who can help is @entity40			1
she said : ' the whole thing is absolutely disgusting			0
i ’ve lived nearly 40 years not realising i was actually registered as a boy and then all of a sudden my whole life fell apart			2
' it means my marriage is a complete farce because technically it ’s illegal			1
we had a big white wedding in a church and spent a fortune and it was all for nothing			0
' invalid ' : a vicar at the church where mrs @entity8 married told her that the birth certificate error means her wedding is not valid ' in the eyes of the law we were technically two men marrying and that was against the law at the time '			1
following her birth her parents were given a birth certificate correctly stating she was a girl - but it had been wrongly recorded in the register ’s office records that she was a male			1
mrs @entity8 found out in september 2003 when she ordered a copy of her birth certificate so she could apply for a permanent @entity3 visa			1
although the @entity72 accepted it was an error they said it was against the law to change it and there was nothing they could do			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' since i found out i have tried everything i can possibly think of to get it changed but it ’s like banging your head against a brick wall			1
' as far as i know i ’m the only person this has happened to and i feel like people do n’t understand and nobody wants to help			0
' we are a @entity90 family and it ’s a massive problem to me that my marriage is illegal			1
wedding : the ceremony marrying @entity95 and mrs @entity8 23 years ago , pictured , is reportedly invalid because of the birth certificate error marriage : according to church experts , the marriage recorded in the above certificate is not valid due to the error ' i want to marry @entity29 again as husband and wife but how can i when i ’m still classed as a boy ? it ’s a disgrace			1
it ’s clearly an error but due to statuary rules they wo n’t change it			2
' the couple contacted five different solicitors and spent money on legal fees as well as the cost of moving back to the @entity1 - around £ 150,000 in total			2
they were told that their marriage in august 1991 was illegal and they never should have been allowed to wed. a letter from the @entity119 in june last year apparently confirmed that the marriage was invalid in the eyes of the @entity122			1
mrs @entity8 , lives in @entity123 with her husband and their five children @entity29 , 26 , @entity126 , 24 , @entity127 , 23 , @entity128 , 21 , and nineteen - year - old @entity129			1
she says when the situation become known locally the family have even been the victims of homophobic abuse because of the ' gay marriage '			1
she said : ' they ’d picked up on what was going on and had told other kids at school that their parents were two men , even though i ’m quite clearly a woman			0
' there was a period of about two weeks when our home was vandalised and the word " queers " was painted all over the garage and the garden wall			2
vanished dream : the family , pictured above in @entity3 , say they had to return to the @entity1 because of the mix - up ' silly string was sprayed everywhere too and we were so scared we had to put up security cameras			1
' we washed the paint off and the cameras stopped them doing it again but we were incredibly embarrassed by the whole thing			0
' we live in a small community and we felt really intimidated			0
i ’m worried about the stigma this is giving my kids and i do n’t want people thinking i ’ve had a sex change			0
' some people might think the kids are adopted and that i ’m trying to hide the fact i ’m a man			0
' my death certificate will say i ’m a boy too and so when i ’m dead and buried , my family down the line will think there was this huge scandal			2
' the family , who moved to @entity3 on a four - year visa in 2004 , were forced to move back to the @entity1 a year later after living their dream life in the @entity180			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' it has always been our dream to move there for as long as i can remember			1
we finally emigrated on a temporary visa and planned to extend it permanently after that			2
birth : the mistake was made almost 50 years ago			0
mrs @entity8 is pictured above after her @entity189 ' i ’d found out the year before we went about the issue with my birth certificate but i did n’t think for a million years it would have any impact on my passport			1
' then , when i saw my passport was due to run out in 2006 , i started looking into it			0
the rules said it is a criminal offence if your circumstances change and you fail to notify the passport office			0
' i was terrified of what would happen but i knew i had to tell them			0
when i explained they said they could n’t issue me a new one unless i managed to correct the mistake on my birth resigtrar			2
' i felt sick with worry and i knew i had to come home to sort it			0
i thought if i did n’t , i ’d end up stranded in @entity3 or worse , i ’d get arrested			2
' the pair , who had set up a successful magazine business in just three months , were forced to pack their bags and return to the @entity1 after just under a year living down under			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' it hit us all really hard when we had to come home			1
at first i thought maybe i ’d get it sorted but that did n’t happen and our temporary visa soon ran out			0
' i feel like i ’ve been a prisoner in my own country for ten years and i want nothing more than to enjoy a family holiday with my kids			0
' we used to love going away together and i feel like this issue has not only affected me but it has deprived my children too			0
' i ’m not getting any younger and my time is running out			0
' mr @entity232 said : ' this has really battered us			0
we are at breaking point and i do n’t know what to do			0
it ’s made a mockery of the whole system and yet a lot of people do n’t seem to understand the seriousness of it			0
our life in @entity3 was unbelievable and we ’ve lost all that			2
' we are a very strong family and i know we can get through anything but this has been difficult for all of us			0
' @entity8 ’s local mp @entity249 has taken on her case and has written to @entity40 asking for her birth entry to be corrected .			2

@entity8 , 49 , was wrongly registered as male when she was born
mrs @entity8 , from @entity123 , now claims that the *decision* means her 23 - year marriage to her husband is invalid
the error also left her unable to extend her @entity3 visa , meaning she and her family had to move home
she has now turned to the prime minister in order to correct the error
