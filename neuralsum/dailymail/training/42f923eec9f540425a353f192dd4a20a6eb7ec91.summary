a famous @entity1 beauty spot that was stripped of its golden sand beach last winter is ready to welcome holidaymakers again after the sand reappeared following last wednesday 's storms			1
@entity6 on the @entity7 took a big hit last february when it was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand a short distance off shore			2
but more bad weather turned out to be a good thing for the popular family spot because it caused hundreds of tonnes of sand to be dumped back onto the shore			1
@entity22 beach is pictured before it was stripped of its sand during storms last winter holidaymakers were unable to enjoy a sandy beach at @entity22 during the warm summer months the sandy cove is located on the @entity7 and is protected by hills locals are celebrating the return of the sandy beach , although they admit it will take some time before it returns to its former glory			1
@entity33 , who owns the @entity34 , said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year after winter erosion stripped it back further than he had ever remembered			1
he said : ' it is unbelievable how much sand has returned over such a short period of time			0
' there is a large stone wall around the entrance of the cove and cafe and it 's normally covered by the sand and has not been seen for years			0
' last winter , the entire 7ft wall was uncovered			0
' the sand reappeared at @entity22 beach after last wednesday 's storms ( file photo ) the beach was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand off shore @entity33 , who owns the @entity34 , said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year without its golden sand holidaymakers and locals were unable to fully enjoy the beach over the warm summer , but mr @entity33 believes its return is perfectly timed for the october half - term holidays			1
' although it may take some time for the beach to recover fully , i am sure that in time it will be back to how everyone remembers it - a sandy , safe beautiful cove			2
' @entity72 ranger @entity71 said the sand 's return was good news for the beach , which is managed by the @entity76			2
' it 's not completely back to normal - that could take years - but from our point of view it shows that it 's all a natural process			2
' @entity72 ranger @entity71 said it could take years for the beach to return to normal beaches such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 suffered the same fate during last winter 's storms he added : ' @entity6 is a closed system , which means the sand has been just off - shore			1
this is n't sand coming in from deep water			0
' it 's what we would expect , although i think it will take a few more storms to fully recover			0
' ' the pool at @entity6 that formed on the beach , which became a bit yucky with algae and the lack of rainfall over the warm summer , has now disappeared			0
' the river has taken a new course			0
