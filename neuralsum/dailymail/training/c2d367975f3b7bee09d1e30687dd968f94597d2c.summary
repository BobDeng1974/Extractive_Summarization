by @entity0 , political correspondent one in 14 women giving birth in the @entity3 are either temporary migrants or visitors – and cost taxpayers £ 182million a year			1
these new mothers , around 50,000 , account for 7 per cent of @entity9 maternity spending			1

patients from outside the @entity36 are currently charged after receiving @entity9 care , but only a fraction of these costs are paid			1
under the health secretary ’s plans , they will be charged one - and - a - half times the cost of the treatment in advance			2
they will also pay a £ 200 upfront charge when they obtain a visa			2
health trusts who fail to track down those with no right to free care could face swingeing fines running to millions of pounds			2
but the plans show that migrants who refuse to pay in advance will still be entitled to emergency treatment – because of the @entity57			2
this includes all maternity services			2
treatment regarded as ‘ urgent ’ because it can not wait until the overseas visitor returns home will also be provided even if hospital staff can not secure a deposit			0
professor @entity65 , of the @entity66 , pictured , l in @entity67 , has said that the flow of @entity70 women flying in to give birth for free at @entity72 s and @entity73 , was so common details of the cost of maternity care were released in @entity78 documents accompanying the plan			2
it said research suggests ‘ overseas visitors and migrants ’ from @entity87 and beyond account for around 2 per cent of @entity9 resources but 7 per cent of its maternity spending			1

@entity100 mp @entity99 , who sits on the @entity101 said : ‘ people must not be allowed to come to this country to use maternity services that they are not paying for			0
i am glad the government is going to start charging these people but the worry is that many of them still will not pay			0
‘ perhaps we should be thinking about making sure our border controls are erected to stop women getting on a plane if they are heavily pregnant			0

there remains a maternity crisis in the @entity9 because of the growing birth rate in the @entity3			1
there is already a shortage of around 4,500 midwives in the @entity9 in @entity140			2
last week figures showed half of health trusts in @entity140 had to close their maternity units at least once in the last year because of a lack of midwives or beds , with closures lasting anything from a few hours to several days			1
patients from outside the @entity36 are currently charged after receiving @entity9 care , but only a fraction of these costs are paid the @entity78 estimates that just £ 73million was recovered from overseas visitors and migrants last year			1
it is not known how much was recovered for maternity care			0
mr @entity31 said : ‘ we have no problem with international visitors using the @entity9 as long as they pay for it – just as @entity3 families do through their taxes			1
‘ these plans will help recoup up to £ 500million a year , making sure the @entity9 is better resourced and more sustainable at a time when doctors and nurses on the frontline are working very hard			1
’ but doctors ’ groups questioned whether the plans were practical and insisted health staff were required to treat the sick			0
dr @entity172 , of the @entity173 , said : ‘ anyone accessing @entity9 services should be eligible to do so but a doctor ’s duty is to treat the patient that ’s in front of them , not to act as border guard			2
‘ there are question marks over whether … the @entity9 has the infrastructure and resources necessary to administrate a cost - effective charging system			2
‘ above all , it ’s vitally important these proposals do n’t have an impact on the care patients receive and that sick and vulnerable patients are n’t deterred from seeking necessary treatment , which can have a knock on effect on public health			0
