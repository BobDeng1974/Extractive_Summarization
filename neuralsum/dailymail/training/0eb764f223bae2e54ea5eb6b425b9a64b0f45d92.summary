space agencies are gearing up to send humans to @entity2 by 2030			2
but this is n't enough for @entity6 chief , @entity5			1
instead of a small crew , he wants to send a million people to the red planet by the end of the century			1
the @entity13 - founder believes that shuttling humans to @entity2 will be the only way to save humanity from extinction			2
the @entity13 - founder believes that shuttling humans to @entity2 will be the only way to save humanity from extinction ' i think there is a strong humanitarian argument for making life multi-planetary , ' @entity5 said in a recent interview with @entity29 at digital magazine @entity30			1
' excluding organic growth , if you could take 100 people at a time , you would need 10,000 trips to get to a million people , ' @entity5 added			1
' but you would also need a lot of cargo to support those people			2
in fact , your cargo to person ratio is going to be quite high			0
' however , @entity5 believes the feat is feasible			2
' it would probably be 10 cargo trips for every human trip , so more like 100,000 trips			0
and we 're talking 100,000 trips of a giant spaceship			0
' @entity5 ( left ) told @entity30 that the absence of any noticeable life on other planets may suggest that the days of humans populating @entity55 are numbered			1
@entity2 ( right ) , he believes , could provide a solution to helping mankind survive in a hostile universe a futuristic design of a protective dome on @entity2			0
last year at the @entity62 conference , @entity5 said that he believes humans need to either colonise other planets or risk going extinct – a fate he describes as ' inevitable ' if we stay on @entity55 last month , @entity67 evealed that @entity68 and @entity6 will build @entity70 's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the @entity72			1
the long awaited $ 6.8 billion ( £ 4.2 billion ) deal will replace the @entity74 and end reliance on @entity78 's @entity77 craft			2
the companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to @entity67			0
but last week it emerged that the pair of commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the @entity72 will be delayed after a losing contender protested the @entity67 awards			0
@entity90 , which lost out with its plans , said there were ' serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process '			0
last year at the @entity62 conference , @entity5 said that he believes humans need to either colonise other planets or risk going extinct – a fate he describes as ' inevitable ' if we stay on @entity55			1
his views were recently echoed by @entity101 who claims ' humanity stupidity ' will spell the end for mankind			2
@entity101 claims climate change , asteroids and crop disease are our biggest threats			0
@entity5 told @entity110 that the absence of any noticeable life on other planets may suggest that the days of humans populating @entity55 are numbered			1
' if you look at our current technology level , something strange has to happen to civilisations , and i mean strange in a bad way , ' he added			0
' and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead , one - planet civilisations			1
' @entity2 , he believes , could provide a solution to helping mankind survive in a hostile universe			0
the first group of settlers , he says , will need to pay their own way			0
he likens the trip to when people moved to the early @entity70 colonies			0
earlier this year , @entity5 announced his @entity6 firm was making ' progress ' towards establishing a smaller colony on the red planet by 2020			1
@entity5 has previously said he created @entity6 for the sole reason of developing rocket technology to get people to @entity2			1
he expects to sell tickets for $ 500,000 ( £ 296,900 ) a trip			0
the first step for colonising @entity2 according to @entity5 would be getting man physically on the @entity148 , a feat he expects within the next 15 to 20 years with a @entity151 capsule			1

@entity153 says it is ' inevitable ' that humans will go extinct on @entity55
he *envisions* taking 100 people at a time to red planet by end of century
@entity5 told @entity110 that the absence of any noticeable life on other planets may suggest that ' there are a whole lot of dead , one - planet civilisations '
he expects to establish a small colony of humans on red planet by 2020
