by @entity0 published : 07:06 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 22 april 2013 a car enthusiast has been reunited with his first car nearly 50 years after he sold it thanks to his brother , who tracked down the vehicle			1
@entity6 , 67 , was just 19 when his father bought his mother the 1934 @entity9 in 1965			1
but she did n't like the vehicle and handed the keys to her son			2
he learned to drive in the two - seater , and used it as a runabout to take trips with friends and woo his early girlfriends			2
first love : @entity6 , with the 1934 @entity9 he 's managed to buy back nearly 50 years after selling it			1
it was his first car , which he learned to drive in and used to woo his earliest girlfriends proud : the rare two - seater , which has a top speed of less than 50mph , is one of only 42 such models left anywhere in the world			2
mr @entity6 says all it needs now is a little work on the starter motor after enjoying a string of dates in the dark green classic car , mr @entity6 succumbed to practicalities and traded it in for robust mini van			1
but he was disappointed when the functional new vehicle failed to live up to the @entity40 's seductive draw and he bought a restored @entity40 taxi to try and recapture the vintage charm			2
returning to the classic @entity44 marque seemed to do the trick and in 1974 mr @entity6 drove the car to his own wedding ceremony			1
now he has incredibly been reunited with his first love - the very same @entity49 10 he learned to drive in - after his brother tracked it down as a surprise			1
' @entity53 ' : mr @entity6 and the car it as a runabout to take trips with friends and woo his early girlfriends , one of whom is pictured alongside the vehicle in this photo taken sometime in 1961 mr @entity6 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , now plans to woo his wife @entity66 , 66 , anew in the motor , which he says first helped him learn to be a romantic			1
' it was the vehicle i owned when i was about 19 or 20 and now i have the car back in my possession after 50 years , ' he said			2
' it used to be my passion wagon			0
' i remember driving it to @entity76 with a friend			0
it was a fabulous trip and we were looking to pull birds and we found a couple			0
' it was just a piece of kit that you started up and went somewhere in			0
you did n't think about doing it in those days , you just did it and it was perfectly fine for the job			0
' a piece of history : picture shows the original handbook for @entity6 's 1934 austin 10 @entity93 , which is still with the vehicle engine performance transmission suspension brakes construction the driver 's manual and , right , the spare parts guide : with a four - cylinder , 1,125cc engine brand new @entity106 @entity105 's were touted as having a top speed of 68mph and could accelerate from 0 - 50mph in 36.5 seconds he added : ' i was looking for something to do and my brother @entity114 found the old car up in @entity116			1
' i bought it as a non-runner , but it is in very good shape indeed and i have taken it up and down the road , although it needs some work on the starter motor , so there is hope for it yet			2
' the two - seater @entity9 owned by mr @entity6 is believed to be one of only 42 known models left in the world			1
he used to park the car outside the unicom telecommunications building where he worked but was told to move it by the managing director , who found it ugly			0
despite not even being able to reach 50mph on the open road the car still holds happy memories for the grandfather - of - two			0
the original sales brochure for mr @entity6 's @entity142 : mr @entity6 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , now plans to woo his wife @entity66 anew in the car , which first helped him learn to be a romantic other cars in the range : launched in 1932 it was @entity151 's best - selling car in the @entity152 and continued in production , with upgrades , until 1947 history : the logbook which shows that it 's the very same vehicle that mr @entity6 owned nearly 50 years ago his wife of nearly 30 years , @entity66 , said that she has played second fiddle to her husband 's love of cars throughout their marriage			1
' we met after he got the car and he did mention his @entity40 to me quite a bit , ' she said			0
' he is a big car enthusiast and the last car he had was another vintage @entity151 that he had for nearly 40 years			0
' that is the one that he had for the longest and he had that when we first got together			0
' he is always talking about his cars and he is particularly fond of this one because it his first car			0

@entity6 was just 19 when he got the keys to the 1934 @entity49
