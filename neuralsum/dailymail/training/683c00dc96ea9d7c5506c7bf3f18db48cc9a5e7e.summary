a sitting @entity1 congressman suggested on wednesday that the @entity2 would be better able to protect the president and his family if the @entity5 went old school with its security measures – and installed a moat around @entity9			1
@entity12 @entity11 rep. @entity10 made the idea part of his brainstorm in a q - and - a session with acting secret service director @entity16 during a @entity18 hearing			1
' would a moat – water , six feet around , be kind of attractive and effective ? ' a straight - faced @entity10 asked			1
@entity16 replied that changes to the presidential mansion 's perimeter fence was the main upgrade under consideration			1
' like a higher fence ? ' @entity10 followed up			2
' you 're right sir , a higher fence would certainly help us , ' the @entity2 director told him			1
@entity66 @entity65 congressman @entity65 , on the other hand , used talk of a fence upgrade as an opportunity to slap the @entity72 administration 's approach to securing @entity1 's southern border			0
federal officials have argued that fencing along the @entity1 - @entity77 border would be worthless			0
' i would think that if the admin 's gon na being consistent , ' @entity65 said , ' it 's now time to remove the fence from around the @entity5 – ' cause if it is n't good enough for our border , it should n't good enough for our @entity5			1
' or else , the conservative firebrand added , @entity72 's policymakers should admit that ' maybe there really is some real virtue in having a fence that slows people down			0
' in his testimony , @entity16 claimed the @entity2 conducts ' some of the best law enforcement work in the world , ' but conceded that it has ' fallen short ' with a series of public embarrassments that led to the resignation of former director @entity48			1
he also told lawmakers his agency was working with the @entity99 to come up with plans for new protective barriers around the @entity5 complex that would be aesthetically pleasing but more effective than the permanent fencing currently in place			1
an ashen - faced @entity16 recounted a 2011 shooting , a series of fence - jumping security breaches and @entity2 agents ' use of prostitutes while on overseas postings – potential security disasters for the president			1
he described them as ' missteps , ' saying that he is ' conducting a comprehensive , bottom - to - top assessment to determine the root cause			0
' @entity16 was named the interim chief in october after @entity119 , a knife - carrying military veteran , scaled the @entity5 's fence			1
@entity119 sprinted into the mansion itself , reaching the storied @entity123 before an off - duty @entity2 agent subdued him			2
an agent who should have been the first line of defense was busy with a personal cell phone call at the time			0
the negative public attention generated by that case , @entity16 said wednesday , had ' detrimental effects on workforce morale and operational security , both with potentially dire consequences			1
' @entity10 , the moat - proposing @entity136 , found it amusing			2
' this guy got further in the @entity5 than some of my @entity141 colleagues have ever gotten , ' he said , laughing			0
@entity143 , mostly : @entity2 details protect the @entity5 , the president and the first family other security lapses – @entity16 called them ' unacceptable ' and ' simply inexcusable ' – have added to the sense of crisis that has enveloped the service for most of 2014			1
one involved a november 2011 shooting on @entity154 in @entity155 that was n't considered an attack on the president until bullet damage and broken glass was discovered days later on the @entity5 's upper floor			2
' the delay in identifying evidence of bullet impacts on the structure of the @entity5 is unacceptable , ' a contrite @entity16 said			2
' as a result , the agency contemporaneously instituted a systematic process to search the exterior of the @entity169 following any reported shootings in the immediate vicinity of the property			0
' he also fell on his sword with respect to a security breach surrounding @entity72 during a september 16 visit to the @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180			2
as the president was whisked into an elevator to attend a briefing on the ebola virus epidemic , an armed private security guard was allowed to join him even though the @entity2 ' advance team ' had not screened him and was n't aware he was carrying a gun			1
that incident ' was self - reported , ' @entity16 said , ' and prompted an immediate after action review within hours of the president ’s departure from the area			2
' ' while the actions of individuals are still being evaluated , ' he added , ' the @entity193 provided guidance and additional written procedures to clarify and reinforce existing policies regarding armed contractors in proximity to the president to prevent similar incidents			0
' @entity66 @entity141 rep. @entity203 told @entity16 during the hearing that @entity2 can not make , and should never have made , the mistakes that got him hauled before @entity49			1
' there ca n't be mistakes , and if there are mistakes but for some other intervening reason , bad things are gon na happen , ' @entity203 said			0
' the can be no mistakes ever			0
you can not do a redo if there is a mistake of security of the president and the president 's family			2
' low - tech fence : @entity119 scaled the wrought - iron barrier in front of the @entity5 on september 19 and ran all the way into the @entity5 while carrying a knife in his pants pocket wednesday 's command performance marked @entity16 's first scheduled tap - dance before impatient lawmakers since @entity72 plucked him out of retirement to succeed @entity232 , whose stock seemed to plummet monthly after a much - ballyhooed start as the @entity2 's first female director			1
before his retirement , @entity16 had led @entity72 's personal protection detail , the visible - yet - invisible cadre of armed and earpiece - wearing agents trained to take a bullet for the president			1
now he 's in the position of arguing that the service is stretched too thin to perform its core functions with sufficient integrity			0
after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 , the agency was tapped to provide security screening for large public events that could been seen as juicy follow - on targets for @entity251 , including the @entity252 and the two major political parties ' quadrennial nominating conventions			1
and in addition to the 27 people who receive full - time , ' round - the - clock protection – the @entity72 and @entity258 families , former presidents , and key current government officials – the agency provided specific protection to dignitaries on 5,700 occasions during the 12 months that ended on september 30			2
those included at least 390 stops during @entity1 officials ' overseas trips			0
@entity272 member rep. @entity271 , right , greeted @entity16 before wednesday 's hearing @entity16 said wednesday that the @entity2 has ' fallen short ' with a series of public embarrassments @entity16 said the @entity2 needs , at minimum , the 6,572 paid ' full - time equivalent ' positions the @entity5 has requested in its 2015 budget			1
in addition to the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign season , he noted , the agency will be expected to protect @entity283 when he visits the @entity1 next year			0
in stark contrast to the confrontational grilling @entity232 received before a congressional committee the day before her resignation , lawmakers largely took it easy on @entity16 wednesday , noting that the breaches he was there to discuss all took place before his time at the helm			0
even conservative attack dogs like @entity299 chairman @entity298 and @entity301 chairman @entity300 respectfully held their tongues			0
' let the record reflect i was fair at least on [ this ] one occasion , ' @entity300 said when his time for questioning expired			0
@entity300 used his allotted questing period to express his concerns that the @entity2 not only has training issues that are negatively affecting agents ' ability to do their jobs correctly but also ' moral ' and ' character ' issues that stem from their hiring practices			0
the @entity316 said he was bothered by reports of agents drinking on the job and sexually harassing female officers – systemic problems that he said would n't be cured with any amount of retraining			0
if you need to go to training to learn to not send explicit texts , ' @entity300 insisted , ' you have no business being in the @entity2			0

@entity12 @entity11 rep. @entity10 asked the acting @entity2 director if @entity9 needs a six - foot moat to protect the president – but stopped short of *recommending* a *drawbridge*
@entity16 fell on his sword before @entity49 , promising to fix the *flailing* agency while he asked for more personnel to run it
secret service agents let a fence - jumper get into the @entity5 and were caught paying for sex while on a presidential ' advance ' trip in @entity343
agency is being squeezed as it covers more and more public events , including the coming presidential *elections* and a 2015 @entity349 visit
acting director was put in place after @entity48 , the service 's first female chief , quit last month following a series of security lapses
