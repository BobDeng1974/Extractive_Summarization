by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 18:41 est , 17 may 2012 after four exhausting and expensive attempts at @entity4 failed , @entity1 and @entity2 feared they were never going to have a family of their own			1
but five years after the couple ’s fertility nightmare began they are celebrating the birth of twins – thanks to the help of a side treatment which involved mrs @entity15 being drip - fed a diet of egg yolks and soya oil			2
doctors believe it could help more women achieve their dream of motherhood , with studies showing the concoction has a remarkable success rate at overcoming an immune system problem in which ‘ killer cells ’ attack a fertilised embryo			1
a delighted @entity1 and @entity2 with their twin boys @entity31 and @entity32 who were born following a fifth round of @entity4 mrs @entity15 , 33 , a teacher , and her husband @entity2 , 40 , a financial adviser , began trying for a child immediately after they married in august 2007			1
after two and a half years with no pregnancy the couple decided to try private @entity4 treatment			1
however , the first three attempts – costing £ 5,000 each time – failed and mrs @entity15 was told cells in her immune system were attacking the fertilised embryos			2
she was then offered ‘ intralipid infusion therapy ’			2
the blend of soya oil and egg products , high in calories and essential fatty acids , is usually used as a nutritional boost for post-operative patients and premature babies			1
it is thought the mix has a stabilising effect on cell membranes , which makes it harder for killer cells to attack			2
content : the newborns pictured sleeping at home			2
although mrs @entity15 had the treatment during her fourth @entity4 course , it took a fifth attempt before she became pregnant @entity31 and @entity32 , pictured in hospital , are now six weeks old and at home with their parents mrs @entity15 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ‘ we did n’t have a holiday for five years but it was all worth it when i found out i was pregnant in october last year			1
we were more than a little ecstatic			2
’ although mrs @entity15 had the treatment during her fourth ivf course , it took a fifth attempt before she became pregnant			0
on april 4 she gave birth at @entity82 to boys @entity31 and @entity32 , who were two months premature			0
@entity31 was the first to be born , weighing 3lb 2oz , followed two minutes later by @entity32 who tipped the scales at 3lb 10oz			0
precious cargo : @entity31 and @entity32 were born four weeks premature mrs @entity15 said : ‘ the first time the @entity4 did n’t work we were devastated			1
however , i ’d produced 18 eggs and they were frozen so they could be used for the next two rounds i had			0
‘ on the fourth @entity4 attempt i was given the soya oil and egg yolk			1
i thought it was a bit odd but by that time i was willing to try anything			0
‘ it was just like a normal drip in your hand but a nurse came to the house and did it			0
‘ i would recommend anyone who is struggling with @entity4 to try it – it has made our dreams come true			1
’ the couple spent a total of £ 25,000 on ivf courses			0
@entity112 infusion therapy is also occasionally used to help women conceive naturally , without any need for @entity4			1
a spokesman for @entity116 , which treated mrs @entity15 , said it offered the therapy to women if they think their only problem in getting pregnant is an over-active immune system			0
‘ sometimes it is given if the couple is trying to conceive naturally , ’ she said			0
‘ they may be having continual miscarriages but nothing seems to be wrong with them			0
’ the treatment is always administered by a qualified nurse under a doctor ’s instructions .			0

the rich fatty *solution* was found to boost @entity4 success rates by six times in a recent study
