@entity11 responded that they were on a public street and not her property , meaning she had no authority to make them go			2

one man reportedly had a broomstick shoved into his mouth			0
' i asked you to leave ! ' the crew reminded her they were on a public sidewalk , but that was n't good enough for her victim ? reporter @entity11 concedes he does n't know who the woman is , but says it 's possible she was one of the victims from the previous night 's kidnapping and assault reported in the home ' do n't touch me ! ' : eventually she is up in the faces of the news crew and threatening them over and over again			1
