the former @entity4 left - back , who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002 , was impressed by @entity11 when he played in that position during sunday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity14			1
it was @entity4 's best performance of the season , keeping them anchored in the @entity19 top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend 's crunch trip to @entity22 to play @entity23			2
@entity2 ( right ) was impressive for @entity4 in sunday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity14 @entity0 , seen here celebrating a goal with @entity25 in 1997 , believes @entity2 deserves his place in the team sunday 's clash between @entity4 and @entity23 will be pivotal in the top four race ' @entity2 's a good , honest pro , ' @entity0 told @entity30			1
' he can play at centre - half if you need him , left - back if you need him , and obviously he 's played mostly in midfield for us this season			1
i think he 's been a really good signing			0
' he 's a player who reads situations very , very well , i thought he played extremely well on sunday			0
it 'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against @entity23 , but it would n't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players , because they played so well			0
' that 's the manager 's decision and he 's got one or two back from suspension and injury , but i thought the team played very well on sunday			0
' blind sets off in pursuit of @entity51 's @entity50 during last week 's @entity52 sixth round tie blind celebrates scoring a late equaliser for @entity4 at @entity55 last month the @entity57 international also scored a crucial late goal at @entity59 earlier in the campaign @entity57 international blind , who arrived at @entity63 from @entity64 for Â£ 13.8m last summer , has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the @entity70 game			1
@entity0 added : ' i know @entity11 can fill in places and he 's done tremendously well for us in midfield			0
' he has n't played at left - back that many times , he 's not played centre - half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there			1
' i thought @entity81 and @entity82 were aggressive , did n't give @entity83 much room , and @entity85 played really well at right - back , so it was good to see and we 'll need plenty of that at @entity22			0
