by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 19:43 est , 17 march 2014 according to @entity4 , @entity3 ’s recreations were ‘ hunting , shooting , fishing , food , rugby , men ’			1
this most extravagant of characters was being uncharacteristically economical , for she could easily have added ‘ exploding shibboleths ’ to that list			2
though she will be remembered by millions as a tv chef , miss @entity3 , whose death was announced yesterday , was more influential and complex than that plastic term suggests			1
she was a former lawyer , an alcoholic and a daughter of wealth who plunged into penury through her own profligate faults			1
country character : @entity3 , pictured above in 2004 , has died at the age of 66 incidentally , she disliked the noun ‘ chef ’			1
‘ i am , ’ she would say , nostrils flaring , ‘ a cook			2
chefs are forever stacking and arranging the food			2
they forget what the food was about in the first place			2
’ it was a typically no - nonsense , ego - pricking statement			1
as soon as a dish was out of the oven she slopped it up on a plate and got stuck in			2
years of posing by poncy tv chefs went down the drain ! @entity3 was , in her eventful life , a pheasant plucker , master butcher , author , restaurateur , businesswoman and @entity46 of @entity47			1
she was also a campaigner , particularly for field sports and farmers ’ markets			2
she was the most prominent supporter of the @entity51 , throwing her considerable weight behind rural people ’s desire to see off the nanny state and be left to their own devices			2
fame : @entity3 , left , alongside @entity58 , right , in the @entity60 cookery series @entity62 's favourite : @entity3 with @entity58 in a @entity60 promotional picture from 1997 @entity3 was one of those countrywomen who , if told not to do something , are more likely to do it			1
was this not the essence of the woman ? she was disobedient			1
in the public ’s mind , she will forever be the larger half of the @entity60 cookery show , the one in the motorbike sidecar with a daft helmet that looked more like a @entity78 bomber pilot ’s headgear			1
she was the one whose accent was as clipped as a stately home ’s yew hedge			2
with it went a politically incorrect approach to hygiene , both in the kitchen and in her language			2
boy , she could be withering when she wished			2
more than any of these , however , @entity3 was a state of mind , an attitude , a two - fingered rebuke to convention			1
she saw that the man ( or woman ) in the ministry was often a fool			2
and like many people who ride in motorbike sidecars , she had a fatalistic side			2
she accepted that life had its potholes and sharp corners			2
the very fact that she had lived so much made her doubly , trebly human			2
@entity105 @entity104 was born in 1947 , the youngest of four children of a celebrated @entity108 surgeon and his soft - hearted @entity110 heiress wife			1
@entity3 loved her mother @entity111			1
she hated her father @entity112			2
@entity113 : @entity3 pictured smoking a pipe in her @entity113 youth , in 1968 her memoirs @entity117 ( 2007 ) accused him of being a violent drunk			1
‘ the first time i saw my father hit my mother i was six , ’ she wrote			0
@entity112 was a surgeon to the @entity123 and his circle included @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
the family lived in a nine - bedroom house in @entity108 ’s smart @entity130 and the appearance was one of prosperous distinction			1
she told of her father beating his wife and using physical violence against his children			0
these stories have been challenged by her sister and niece			0
what seems less open to dispute is that @entity3 saw herself as a victim			1
perhaps this most melancholy of women was trying to understand why , in her middle years , she fell so dreadfully into the bottle			0
all those @entity148 names sound more like roll - call at a convent school			1
she said that the last one , @entity152 , was in memory of her father ’s favourite pig			0
was he signalling a lack of interest in his fourth child ? he later said she was an ‘ unwanted ’ addition to the family			0
it may explain the sadness in those bloodhound eyes , the slight droopiness of the mouth			0
she was happier at boarding school ( the @entity166 , in @entity167 ) than at home			0
her headmistress , mother @entity169 , asked her why this should be and @entity3 told her about her father ’s roughness			1
mother @entity169 told her she was a wicked child to speak so ill of a fine , upstanding man and reported her remarks to @entity112			0
‘ it took me years to trust anyone again , ’ wrote @entity3			1
the old man wanted her to go into medicine			0
she chose the law and became a barrister ( the youngest female barrister in @entity182 ) in 1968			0
she claimed to have been a contemporary of @entity184 and said he had the camp nickname ‘ @entity187 ’			0
in fact , she was called to the bar eight years before @entity184			0
the law , at least in those days , was a place of @entity192 lunches and @entity194 dinners			0
@entity3 , once a slender , slightly bohemian figure , threw herself into the party scene			1
fondly remembered : @entity3 riding in a motorcycle sidecar alongside @entity58 her diabetic father was also a drinker - his breakfast orange juice was allegedly laced with vodka			1
her mother ’s death in 1975 distressed her greatly and she started drinking hard			0
she later wrote that she thought alcohol was ‘ the key to the universe , the abatement of pain ’			0
some said she was a good enough lawyer to have become lord chancellor one day			1
drink and rebelliousness prevented that			1
at her local pub in @entity216 they would give her four double gins and two small tonics in a pint mug when she arrived for the evening			0
her legal career collapsed , but she had enough money ( an inheritance of £ 2.8million ) to be able to ignore this			0
but in 1982 she went off the rails after the death of her boyfriend , an insurance salesman called @entity227 — ‘ the only real love of my life , ’ she wrote			0
they had conducted an affair for 14 years , much of it in restaurants ( until they were thrown out for becoming too rowdy )			0
when the drink killed @entity227 , she started a mad bout of boozing and one - night stands , including an assignation with an unnamed mp in the @entity240 - she claimed they made love behind the speaker ’s chair			1
later career : @entity3 in a photo opportunity for @entity247 with @entity3 during that time , when she was bouncing off walls in @entity250 pubs and bedding @entity252 republican sympathisers , she sought solace in two pints of gin a day			1
it was washed down with so much tonic that , she claimed , the quinine finally damaged her adrenal gland			0
she twice slept on benches at @entity108 ’s @entity261 coach station			0
she eventually came to her senses and , with her brother ’s encouragement , went to @entity265			0
she gave up drink and ended up running the @entity267 in @entity268 , a honeypot for creative types			1
a tv producer friend suggested she meet @entity58 , the eccentric office cook at the @entity273 magazine			1
they were teamed in 1996 as the @entity60 and a tv hit ( the @entity277 ’s favourite ) was minted			1
it was , wrote @entity3 , ‘ a great achievement for two old bats ’			1
though they were less close than the cameras suggested , there was a perfect chemistry			0
@entity58 gurgled with laughter , delighted in practical jokes and slowly roasted herself in the juices of conviviality			0
she was a good 20 years older than her co-star , yet she radiated an almost childlike delight			0
@entity3 was more private , bookish and acid			1
she was prone to bouts of introspection and anger at the modern world			0
the @entity296 loathed her forthright opinions but she should have been a feminist pin - up : an intelligent woman unfazed that she looked so unpretty			1
after @entity58 ’s death , @entity3 could have disappeared			1
that she did not was evidence that she had struck a public chord			0
lofty : @entity3 at the @entity303 in june 2008 fans loved her plain speaking and contempt for health and safety ( she thought environmental health officers a particular menace )			1
despite that la - di - dah accent , she had no time for snobbery			1
she was uninterested in hierarchy , except the gradations of egg sizes and the relative merits of decent vinegar			0
proper country pursuit : @entity3 out hunting i saw her sail past lots of famous faces at a @entity108 party to bury herself in conversation with a junior publishing assistant			1
she revelled in making modern , urban , moist - palmed @entity328 re-examine its platitudes and justify its incorrigibly spongy - brained ways			1
her long support for hunting probably cost her thousands of book sales			0
she cared not one jot			0
to her - and she was a considerable animal lover - the case against hunting was emotive and misguided			1
she considered hunting to be a perfectly proper country pursuit and could not abide the busy - body animal rights brigade who seemed to know a great deal less about animal welfare than the rural people they criticised			2
she was a bird - watcher , but also a bird eater			2
pink - foot geese ? yes , she said , beautiful creatures - and with a very delicate flavour			2
her views often got her in trouble			0
two years ago , she suggested that instead of a ministry cull , we should start eating badgers			0
after all , badger was once a regular dish for working men and in her youth she claimed to have seen badger hams in @entity361 pubs			0
‘ just like a jamon iberico , ’ she said			0
at first , one thought this is outrageous			0
but then , on further consideration , one realised that she maybe had a point			0
@entity3 distrusted modernism and smouldered with disdain for soppy sentimentalism			1
she was a stonking , snorting original and perhaps the only surprising thing is that , after the lakes of booze she drank earlier in her life , she made it to 66 .			2

two @entity60 star died yesterday aged 66 following a period of illness
but she was more influential and complex than ' tv chef ' suggests
she was a lawyer , *battled* with drink and plunged herself into penury
the essence of @entity3 was that she was disobedient - magnificently so
