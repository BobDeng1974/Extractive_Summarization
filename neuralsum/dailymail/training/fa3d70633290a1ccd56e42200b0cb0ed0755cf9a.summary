@entity0 bolstered his reelection coffers to the tune of $ 15million last night following a star studded @entity5 dinner where @entity6 played the suave host and chef @entity8 whipped up dinner			1
@entity0 reminded 150 of his @entity5 set donors that his famed @entity12 poster from the 2008 was derived from a photograph of @entity0 sitting next to @entity6 when @entity0 was a @entity14 senator			1
@entity6 had been in @entity15 advocating on behalf of @entity16			1
' this is the first time that @entity6 has been photo - shopped out of a picture , ' @entity0 said			2
' never happened before , never happen again			2
' obviously , ' the president said obliquely , ' yesterday we made some news			2
' the event , held under a stretched transparent tent outside @entity6 's sprawling tudor - styled canyon home that he bought about 20 years ago from @entity39 singer @entity38 , raised nearly $ 15million , a record for a single fundraiser			1
the guests paid $ 40,000 to attend , accounting for about $ 6 million of the evening 's financial haul for @entity0 's campaign and the @entity45			1
political pals : @entity6 and president @entity0 have met on a number of occasions , like this @entity16 event in april the invitation for the sold - out fundraiser on behalf of president @entity0 at the @entity54 home of @entity6 the remainder came from a raffle for small dollar donors			1
two winners - both women - got to take part in the dinner			2
one winner was @entity62 , 55 , a science teacher from @entity63			2
her son was in the @entity65 , and her husband - though a @entity66 - voted for mr @entity0 in 2008			2
the second winner was @entity69 , 45 , who works for a utility company in @entity71 , @entity72			2
she brought her husband , who served in the military , as her guest			2
in the advertisement for the competition , the upbeat president wrote : ' you 'll automatically be in the running to join me and @entity6 at his place on may 10th			0
' it 's not often i get away from work , so i look forward to spending a fun evening in @entity84 with a couple supporters like you			1
' photoshopped out : in his speech at the fundraiser , mr @entity0 reminded the crowd that @entity6 was actually sitting next to him at the event where the picture used for the famous ' @entity12 ' was taken sign of the house : @entity6 's drive warns of a pig because the actor was known for having one as a pet ' we raised a lot of money because people love @entity6 , ' @entity0 said			1
' they like me ; they love @entity6			0
' aside from a small number of brief interjections of serious talk , mr @entity0 kept the majority of his speech light			0
' and @entity112 and i -- people have commented on the fact that i 've got gray hair now			0
there was a blog post about look how wrinkly @entity0 is getting			0
it was sort of distressing			0
@entity6 does nâ€™t have to go through these things , ' he said			0
' sometimes the 2008 campaign gets romanticized and everybody says how perfect it was and i have to remind them , no , i was there			0
' ' better than the @entity125 ' : the food was prepared by celebrity chef @entity8 end of the night : @entity127 waits for his car after the extravagant dinner at @entity6 's home the big bottom line of the event will help the president 's re-election campaign funding , as he faces the huge sums of money raised by @entity66 groups like @entity138 , set up by @entity139			1
@entity0 's campaign chief @entity140 told @entity141 that it would take 181,000 of their small - time donors to match a recent anonymous $ 10m donation to @entity138			1
' so @entity6 is pitching in here , and lending his name to this event , and himself to this event			1
it 's really helpful to us			0
' crossroads , however , have seized on the planned dinner as another opportunity to attack @entity0 for being a ' celebrity president '			0
the star power certainly helps the @entity157 's bottom line , however , as @entity6 told the @entity158 last month that they had already raised around $ 10m , ' which is about double anything that 's ever been done before			1
all i know is that it 's the biggest fundraiser to date - ever			0
' at the dinner , mr @entity0 gave serious compliments to the host , adding : ' he seems to occupy a constant state of grace , and uses his extraordinary talents on behalf of something truly important			0
' in attendance : @entity6 's girlfriend @entity172 ( left ) , actor @entity169 ( center ) , and actress @entity171 ( right ) are among the 150 guests star - filled room : @entity179 ( left ) , @entity176 ( center ) , @entity178 ( right ) are all thought to be there the @entity125 - winning film star has hit the headlines recently for his involvement in the humanitarian campaign over @entity185			1
he was even arrested while attempting to draw attention to the bombing of refugees in the @entity190 valley			1
for @entity0 , the a-list party was not only a financial hit , it gave the president the kind of @entity5 buzz a @entity66 seldom gets			0
but the glitzy event , with its glamour and wealth , also has its risks and it set up a stark contrast with @entity0 's mission on friday to highlight the plight of struggling homeowners in @entity204			1
among those at the dinner were such actors and performers as @entity169 , @entity176 and her husband @entity209 , @entity179 , @entity171 and @entity178 , who shared a table with @entity6 and @entity6 's girlfriend @entity211			0
preparations : the catering trucks lined the street outside @entity6 's @entity5 home on thursday all the little details : a server is seen carrying in peanuts , but given that guests are paying $ 45,000 for a seat at the dinner , they 'd better hope the kitchen was focusing on the main meals serious security : police surrounded @entity6 's home for the days leading up to the event thursday night soda and beer : @entity231 is known about what is being served at the dinner , but beverages were seen being delivered to mr @entity6 's home on thursday there was speculation that other guests may include @entity0 supporters @entity238 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242			1
details have been kept strictly under wraps , but website @entity245 revealed that diners will be catered for by famous chef @entity8 , adding that the food would be ' better than the @entity125			1
' heading to @entity6 's house , along the exclusive canyon roads , families gathered at dinner time to gawk , wave and cheer the presidential motorcade			0
children manned a lemonade stand with a sign : ' presidents drink free			0
' around the corner , a boy held up another hand - drawn piece of cardboard : ' will trade @entity263 for @entity264 if you stop			0
' and yet one more : ' our gay family says thanks mr. president			0

diners have paid up to $ 40,000 to attend the glittering @entity84 event
