just before 11am on a crisp march morning , 30 men and women from one of @entity4 ’s most fashionable hunts gathered near @entity5			2
resplendent in their distinctive ‘ @entity11 ’ livery , @entity8 ’s @entity7 members passed around the stirrup cup for the traditional toast before the huntsman blew his horn and the riders cantered off , following their yelping hounds			1
at the fore was the hunt ’s joint master , the @entity21 mrs @entity19			1
known affectionately to her friends as @entity24 , mrs @entity19 is rightly proud of the hunt ’s 254 - year history			1
in the past both @entity27 and lady @entity28 have been masters , and today its 250 members include entrepreneur @entity31 , who is vice-president of its pony club			0
the @entity7 , one of the richest in the country , has long been a target for anti-hunt protesters determined to prove it flouts hunting laws on that damp morning of march 11 , huntsman @entity39 decided to take the hunt through picturesque @entity42 country on to land west of @entity44 , above the famous @entity45 , where – in keeping with hunting laws – a scented trail had been laid earlier for the hounds to follow			1
but what none of those riding that morning could have known was that the day ’s events would threaten to become a cause celebre , which is now the subject of a court battle			1
the @entity7 , one of the richest in the country , has long been a target for anti-hunt protesters determined to prove it flouts hunting laws and that , instead of ensuring the hounds follow the trail , the @entity57 willingly allows them to chase foxes whose scent they pick up			1
and in this pursuit , the anti-hunt campaigners have a willing partner : the @entity65			1
many in the hunting fraternity believe that the court case , in which a member of the @entity57 is accused of a single count of breaching the hunting ban by pursuing a wild mammal with hounds , is the result of collusion between the activists and a partisan @entity65			1
they are convinced that the charity has become an increasingly politicised lobby , bent on pursuing an obsessive and costly vendetta against @entity4 ’s hunting elite			2
as one insider observed : ‘ the lunatics are running the asylum			0
the @entity65 has become indoctrinated in an animal - rights philosophy , and that is its downfall			1
‘ the charity is a massive institution with 1,400 employees and an income of more than £ 120 million , and yet it is run by a board of 21 trustees , few with experience of running a business , and some who are , frankly , staunch animal - rights activists			1
’ it has even been suggested that , abetted by animal - rights activists , the @entity65 has been targeting well - heeled hunting communities in a cynical bid to raise its profile			1
@entity21 mrs @entity19 has been singled out as someone who represents everything the activists despise about @entity105 ’s hunting history many , too , are concerned that the charity is ‘ wasting ’ too much of its fortune – made up mostly from donations and legacies – chasing minor misdemeanours			1
the @entity111 reported in october that the @entity65 had spent £ 22.5 million on prosecutions in two years , and today we can reveal that the charity has been forced to take out an overdraft facility with its bank , @entity117 , for the first time in its 190 - year history			1
the @entity57 case epitomises the battle for the soul of the @entity105 countryside			1
so far as the hunters are concerned , they have today become the hunted – followed and filmed by a battery of anti-hunt activists including @entity8 hunt saboteurs , the anti-hunt group @entity130 , and monitors for the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			1
they hand over yards of footage to the @entity65 in the hope that it will provide evidence upon which the charity can press charges			2
in the dock is @entity39 , mrs @entity19 ’s fellow huntmaster			1
mr @entity39 has pleaded not guilty at @entity142 ’ @entity143 to breaching the hunting ban and will mount a vigorous defence when the case comes to trial in the spring			2
his solicitor , @entity148 , insists mr @entity39 is innocent			2
‘ he will vigorously contest what appears to be an extremely weak case , ’ he says			0
‘ i am very surprised it has made it this far			0
’ the prosecution ’s case will hinge on footage filmed as the hunt passed the picturesque village of @entity158			2
taken with a hand - held camera by @entity161 , from the @entity132 , it was subsequently passed to the @entity65 rather than to the police or the @entity163 ( @entity163 )			2
it is said to depict mr @entity39 allowing two hounds to chase a fox , allegedly in breach of the @entity167			2
the @entity132 has been delighted by the prosecution			0
its members and fellow activists have long disliked the @entity7 , seeing it as symbolic of hunting ’s aristocratic past			1
as one anti-hunt activist explains : ‘ it is run along feudal lines			2
landowners and farmers are encouraged to give permission for the hunt to make use of their land – there might , for example , be the offer of the loan of some farm equipment you especially need			0
’ mrs @entity19 has been singled out as someone who represents everything the activists despise about @entity105 ’s hunting history			1
a committed wildlife conservationist , mrs @entity19 has already been targeted by animal - rights activists , who mistakenly believed she supported trials for the government ’s badger cull and would allow one to take place on her @entity8 estate			1
she was forced to make a ‘ painful decision ’ to step down as patron of the @entity206 , fearing that the work of the charity , founded by her grandfather more than half a century ago , would be compromised by her continued presence			0
activists inundated the dwt ’s @entity213 and @entity214 pages with abusive messages			0
it became a systematic campaign eventually linked to the discovery of ‘ suspicious figures ’ hanging around mrs @entity19 ’s home			1
security had to be stepped up after a picture of the house was published on @entity225 ’s website with the words ‘ badger killer @entity227 ’ written , graffiti - style , in bright red			0
as for the court case , it is understood that even @entity161 , who shot the footage , is privately doubtful that mr @entity39 will be convicted			2
he has admitted to friends that the film was taken from some distance and identification will be disputed			0
whatever the outcome , the case will once again turn the spotlight on the close relationship between the @entity65 and the animal - rights movements			1
during the autumn , an independent report by @entity243 , a former chief inspector of the @entity244 , recommended that the charity should pass on any evidence of law - breaking to either the police or @entity163			0
since then , the charity has indicated that in future it will abide by the @entity243 recommendations			0
the case , however , calls that commitment into question			0
why , for example , is the @entity65 mounting this prosecution and not the police ? @entity259 , director of campaigns for the @entity261 , said : ‘ it clearly can not make an objective decision			2
we believe this decision involving @entity57 has a blatant political element to it			0
‘ the @entity57 has been harassed by employees of animal - rights organisations carrying out covert surveillance for almost ten years and , until now , there has not been a single prosecution , let alone a conviction			1
’ he believes the @entity57 has no case to answer			0
‘ we have every confidence that @entity57 was operating entirely legally on the day in question and we do n’t believe the evidence justifies the prosecution , ’ he says			0
even @entity278 , an anti-hunt supporter who regularly monitors hunts and reports his finding to the charity , admits that the @entity7 is well organised			1
‘ i would say it is one of the better managed and more disciplined hunts , despite some of the incidents recorded against it in the past , ’ he says			0
‘ generally speaking , if @entity288 and her husband are out riding , things tend to be calmer because they tolerate us – although they ignore us – and try to ensure none of the others gets involved either			0
’ so why is the @entity65 so keen to prosecute mr @entity39 ? its official explanation is that ‘ there is a public interest in bringing such a prosecution ’			1
a charity spokesman added : ‘ we look closely at whether the quality of the evidence meets the usual tests too			0
we take our enforcement role seriously			0
’ protest : an anti-hunt campaigner holds up his banner in 2005 after @entity306 was passed but one animal - rights supporter with knowledge of the case believes much of it is a face - saving exercise			1
‘ the @entity65 was very keen to run this one up the flagpole in the wake of the @entity243 report to prove it was still a force to be reckoned with , ’ he said			2
‘ but we ’re not confident it will go the distance and if it does , we do n’t think it will result in a conviction			0
‘ proving identification is incredibly difficult at the best of times			0
and this is n’t the best evidence			0
but they think there is a chance			0
’ certainly , as a charity the @entity65 is under pressure to explain its prosecutions policy			1
and internally it is riven with disagreements between the old guard , who fear donations will dry up if it becomes too political , and hardline activists			0
although the charity , whose patron is the @entity336 , remains one of the wealthiest in the @entity105 , with investment assets of £ 82 million , much of this cash is thought to be tied up in long - term deals			1
one person involved in animal rescue said : ‘ i have been told the past three months have been like a white - knuckle ride in making payments and that the @entity65 has had to go to the bank and agree an overdraft for the first time			1
’ in a statement , the @entity65 confirmed it had made ‘ contingency plans to ensure efficient cash flow ’ and had negotiated an overdraft , but insisted : ‘ we have not used this facility and do not foresee any reason to use it at this present time			2
’ for the @entity7 it was business as usual for the @entity359 meet			2
‘ they are quietly confident that mr @entity39 will be acquitted eventually , ’ says one local landowner			0
‘ if the court has any sense , the case will be thrown out			0
that is the thinking around here			0
’ additional reporting : @entity366			0
