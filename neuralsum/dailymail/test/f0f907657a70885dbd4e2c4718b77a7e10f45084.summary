@entity1 , it 's the biggest bogan in @entity2 ! this is the image of the @entity5 statue that the @entity6 is aiming to erect in the town of @entity8 to honour the @entity2 icon - and hopefully draw in the crowds			1
the man behind it all is @entity13 who is the manager of engineering services for the council and this is his design for the statue			2
this is how @entity13 envisages the ' @entity20 ' statue will look like pass us a smoke mate : the term ' bogan ' has a number of negative connotations for @entity2 but has become a character part of popular folklore , being depicted here by actor @entity30 mr @entity13 said the 3.6 - metre statue would show a ' bloke ' wearing shorts , thongs and a singlet with a fishing rod and a tuckerbox			1
locals and visitors would also be able to sit on it and take photographs			2
' @entity42 of the @entity44 suggestion to me some time ago that @entity8 would benefit froma “ @entity5 ” sculpture as a tourist attraction so i have been considering various designs for its construction , ' mr @entity13 told @entity51			2
' although i do not like the way a ' bogan ' is depicted and i do not want @entity8 to be thought of as being a town full of “ bogans ” , it is a term that is widely used and well known in @entity2 and @entity57			2
' where better in @entity2 could we have “ @entity59 ” than on the banks of the @entity61 , in @entity6 ? ' @entity6 , in western @entity62 , wants to erect a ' big bogan ' statue the ' big bogan ' statue could prove as popular as the @entity65 which is a tourist attraction in @entity66 mr @entity13 's proposal is for a 3.6m tall steel figure cut out of 5mm steel plate			1
the figure is wearing a singlet , has a handlebar moustache and is holding a fishing rod			1
the esky in the original drawing would be constructed as a three dimensional steel box fixed to the sculpture to allow tourists to sit on to have their photo taken			0
' i would like the sculpture to be related to @entity8 on the @entity61 , i have used the fishing theme and i would like to see it located on the eastern side of the @entity85 opposite the @entity86 , ' mr @entity80 said			0
' in this location it would be on the highway , at the river , and visible from both directions			0
' the traditional bogan image has include a ' mullett ' style haircut , singlet and thongs , and beer could the ' big bogan ' rival this ? nicknamed ' @entity101 ' , @entity100 is a 15.2 metres tall concrete merino ram , located in @entity103 , @entity62 the @entity104 in @entity105 has become famous in the region he estimated the construction and installation of the ' @entity20 ' would be a total cost of $ 8,000			1
the ' big bogan ' statue could prove as popular as the @entity65 which is a tourist attraction in @entity66 , the @entity100 in @entity103 , the @entity104 in @entity105 and @entity115 's @entity114			1
however , @entity6 said the venture would not go ahead until the community gave it the thumbs up			1
@entity119 reports that local residents have expressed mixed feelings about it already			0
in the @entity115 , the @entity114 is a major feature one said it was a great idea - but it could be improved			0
' one thing that 's missing is the stubby , ' he said			0
another resident was less enthusiastic			0
' i do not identify as a bogan - if you look up bogan , it 's very negative , ' she said .			0
