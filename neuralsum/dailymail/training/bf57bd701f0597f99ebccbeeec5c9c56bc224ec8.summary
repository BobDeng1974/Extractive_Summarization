by @entity0 when @entity1 made his comments about @entity4 ’s criticisms of him , he spoke from the heart			1
it may not have been the wisest thing to do : you can never beat the media			0
and for the first time in his reign , even more so than in @entity12 , he looks and sounds like a man who ’s feeling the heat			1
but he spoke from the heart			0
captains are under so much scrutiny from so many critics that it ’s tempting to shout : ‘ look , i ’m trying my hardest ! ’ but it ’s still not advisable to respond to @entity4 in that way			1
salute : @entity0 gestures towards the media centre after his ton against @entity25 at @entity26 in 2002 no 3 : @entity0 points to the number on his back i ’m not saying any captain can get it right all the time			1
i remember giving a three - fingered salute to @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 in the @entity37 ’s media centre after i made a one - day hundred batting at @entity39 against @entity25			1
i had no personal animosity towards any of them , but i had used what they said to fire me up			0
and my reaction obviously told everyone i was pretty fired up			0
some people will have listened to @entity4 over the last couple of years and wondered whether he ’s gone too far in his criticism of @entity1			1
but i can assure you that @entity4 has no issues with @entity1 the man — just with @entity1 the captain			1
he ’s paid to give his views			0
it ’s true @entity4 can be repetitive			1
but he has a fantastic cricket brain and @entity1 should try to ignore the repetitiveness and focus on the content			2
it ’s always worth bearing in mind how your reaction to criticism is going to be greeted			0
when @entity1 wakes up this morning , the headlines will be all about him and @entity4			1
but his main battle has to be with @entity68 ’s bowlers			2
it has to be about finding a way to deal with the pitched - up delivery that attacks all round the world now know is the way to get him			0
anything else is just going to cloud his mind			0
feud : @entity1 said that he believes some of @entity4 's attacks on his captaincy are personal outspoken : @entity4 has been critical of @entity1 on @entity80 , and called his 294 against @entity25 in 2011 ' boring ' conservative : @entity82 delayed their declaration at @entity26 and @entity68 survived at nine wickets down it ’s not good taking on the media			1
scoring runs and winning test matches is the only currency that matters right now			0
besides , i actually thought there were signs of progress in the way he led @entity82 at @entity26			2
@entity1 and i spoke very briefly on the field during his benefit game at @entity100 recently , but it lasted a few minutes and was n’t about leadership			2
my phone is always on			0
yes , captaincy can be a lonely job			0
but he ’ll find it becomes easier if he focuses on the things that matter : adding to his tally of over 8,000 @entity111 runs and 25 hundreds and helping @entity82 rediscover winning ways .			2
