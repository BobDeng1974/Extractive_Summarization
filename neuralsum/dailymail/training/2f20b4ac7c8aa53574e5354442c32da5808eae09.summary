idea : @entity2 transport secretary @entity1 is understood to be spearheading the move a damaging split has opened in @entity6 ’s top team over a controversial plan to commit @entity8 to renationalise the railways			1
@entity2 transport secretary @entity1 , who has repeatedly attacked the ‘ fragmentation ’ of the current train system , is understood to be spearheading the move			1
but @entity8 left - wingers say the idea is being ‘ stifled ’ by shadow chancellor @entity14 on the grounds that the party should not make potentially costly spending commitments two years away from the next general election			1
one senior @entity8 mp said : ‘ @entity1 is simply trying to float the plan for discussion , @entity14 is trying to kill it off at birth			1
but how are we going to convince the voters if we do n’t have any firm policies ? ’ however , others warned that nationalising the railways was a ‘ multi-billion - pound plan ’ that mr @entity14 was right to block			2
the row comes amid hints from mr @entity6 that the party will go into the next election on its most left - wing manifesto since @entity36 was leader			0
well - placed sources claim that mr @entity6 is being urged to capitalise on public anger over rocketing rail fares by considering returning the main ‘ @entity42 ’ lines to public ownership			0
@entity44 mp ms @entity1 has repeatedly refused to rule out nationalising the main rail lines , sold off under the @entity46 of @entity47 in the 1990s			2
example : labour candidates pressuring @entity6 said more franchises should be run like the publicly - owned @entity52 line @entity53 suggested that mr @entity6 – dubbed ‘ @entity6 ’ by critics for being too left - wing – was privately sympathetic to the rail plan			0
one said : ‘ i suspect @entity6 quite likes it			0
after all , passengers are getting royally screwed by the private train companies as it is , so why would it be so unpopular ? ’ last night , @entity63 mp @entity62 said : ‘ rail privatisation has achieved massive improvements in infrastructure and service , with passenger numbers way up			0
any attempt to reverse that would be hugely costly for the taxpayer			0
’ a spokesman for ms @entity1 said there had been no decision about whether lines should be nationalised , and denied there had been any rows with the @entity14 over future @entity78 declined to comment .			1

@entity80 secretary @entity1 thought to be leading move
but shadow chancellor @entity14 ' stifling ' the plans over cost fears
