a @entity0 running for the @entity1 in @entity2 is so worried about the negative effect being associated with president @entity4 could have on her campaign , she would n't even admit to voting for him on thursday when asked by a newspaper about her past support for her party 's leader			1
democrat @entity11 refused to reveal her vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections to the @entity15 editorial board during an endorsement interview yesterday , claiming ' this election is n't about the president			1
' pressed to give a simple yes or no answer , @entity11 , who has been open about her support for @entity4 in the past , began talking about how she backed @entity22 in the 2008 @entity24 primary and tied herself to former president @entity26 's policies			1
@entity2 's @entity24 @entity1 nominee , @entity11 , would n't say yesterday whether she voted for @entity4 in 2008 or 2012 despite having openly announcing her support for him in the past			1
she 's pictured here speaking at the @entity31 picnic in august in @entity31 , @entity2 she then tried to wiggle her way out of the tight spot by telling her interviewers , ' i respect the sanctity of the ballot box , and i know that the members of this editorial board do as well			0
' ' so you 're not gon na answer , ' one of the board 's members replied , matter - of - factually			0
' again , i do n't think that the president is on the ballot , as much as @entity46 might want him to be , ' she said referring to her @entity48 opponent			0
' it 's my name on the ballot , and it 's gon na be me holding [ @entity4 ] accountable for the failed decisions and votes he had made against the people of @entity2			1
' a longtime @entity0 who won the office of secretary of state in 2011 with the support of her party , @entity11 is the daughter of a former @entity24 chair of @entity2 , @entity59			2
@entity11 ' father also served as a state representative - an office he proudly held as a @entity0			0
asked about the risks associated with supporting @entity4 in 2012 by the @entity64 , @entity11 said : ‘ i ’m a lifelong @entity0			1
i ’m very proud of that and the values our party stands for			0
my support of our party and our nominee is well - known			0
’ @entity11 has sought to distance herself from the @entity24 president throughout her campaign against @entity74 , however , even releasing an ad last month definitively stating that she 's ' not @entity4 , ' just in case anyone was confused			1
and like most other democrats facing tough election battles , she 's evaded the president on the campaign trail , opting to have @entity24 surrogates like the @entity83 campaign for her instead			2
@entity2 secretary of state @entity11 campaigns with former @entity84 president @entity26 on august 6 in @entity85 , @entity2			2
@entity11 in a virtual tie with the incumbent , senate minority leader @entity46 , and is touting her support for the @entity83 instead of @entity4 in her efforts to woo @entity2 voters but @entity11 ' attempt to disown the president entirely sets a new precedent for @entity24 this election cycle			1
while other high - profile democrats have claimed that they disagree with the way the president has handled certain issues and have publicly suggested they do n't want him campaigning for them , none have disavowed him completely			0
@entity11 latest move shows just how toxic candidates from the president 's party believe the once - beloved national leader to be now , a mere one and a half years into his second term			1
@entity4 has not had an approval rating above 45 percent in @entity111 's weekly tracking poll since last year			2

@entity11 ' fear of losing her race to incumbent senator @entity74 , a @entity48 who has held the seat since 1985 , is not unfounded			0
