a dozen of the @entity2 ’s most feared attack aircraft are to be deployed in the battle against @entity4			1
twelve a- 10 ‘ @entity14 ’ are being moved from @entity5 to @entity6 to carry out patrols against the @entity9 militants who have taken swathes of @entity12 and @entity13 territory			1
the new deployment will boost the @entity2 ’s ability to patrol the skies and take out @entity4 targets			1
deadly force : a line up of @entity22 at @entity23 , @entity24			0
planes of this type will arrive in @entity6 for combat operations next week slow and steady : an unarmed a- 10 shows the maneuverability which makes it a deadly foe to ground forces			1
it can fly steadily at slow speed at just 50 feet above enemy positions and is heavily armored against gunfire in action : an a- 10 above @entity5 , where it has been used with deadly effect against the @entity39			1
as well as its 30mm cannon which can be seen on the nose , it is carrying missiles under the inner wing close support : a- 10s work closely with ground troops including , here , @entity52 @entity51 units in @entity5 they will be joined within weeks by around six @entity55 drones armed with missiles , the @entity53 reported			1
the new weaponry marks an increase in the options open to military planners who have struggled to strike @entity4			2
@entity61 10s , originally designed to destroy @entity63 tank squadrons if the @entity63 had invaded the @entity64 , have proved a deadly weapon against @entity39 fighters in @entity5			1
slow - moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs - they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter - bombers which have so far been deployed in @entity12 and @entity13			1
the decision to deploy @entity22 and @entity76 comes after a major battle - planning conference involving more than 200 commanders from 33 countries involved in the fight against @entity4			1
@entity52 remains by far the largest single country involved , but has now received backing from more @entity83 countries			0
@entity84 is to send f - 16s to attack the militants under the @entity52 - led operation			0
however the main concern over the campaign has been the lack of targets to strike because of the nature of @entity4 , which combines large groups acting like a conventional army , with insurgency tactics			1
unmanned : a reaper preparing for take - off			0
some of its missile load can be seen under the left wing remote control : pilots at @entity103 in @entity104 at the controls of a @entity55 during a training mission			0
the @entity12 and @entity13 missions against @entity4 will be flown from @entity23 , @entity24 @entity108 : @entity4 fighters will be firmly in the sights of a- 10 pilots			1
the light weaponry they carry is unable to damage an a- 10 , while it can hit them with 4,000 30mm rounds in just a minute			0
takeover : the @entity4 threat to @entity12 and @entity13 was demonstrated when the militant group took control of the @entity13 town of @entity122			1
it has mounted shows of strength in the town and beyond frontline : these @entity4 fighters near @entity129 are typical of the targets for the a- 10			1
lightly armed and on the move , they are difficult for bombers and strike fighters to target but can be stalked from the air by the @entity22 , which loiter over targets for hours it is the ugliest aircraft in the @entity2 's arsenal			2
the @entity131 was designed to destroy @entity63 tanks and troops on the ground			0
officially the @entity131 , it was quickly nicknamed the @entity131 for its unusual looks , it was specifically designed around its main weapon , a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute			0
the plane can fly low and slow , coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions			2
its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and ' loiter ' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane			2
the @entity131 is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor , making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons			0
even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine , with no tailfin and half a wing missing			0
on board the single - seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon , which is accurate to 4,000ft , and fires depleted - uranium shells , as well as @entity171 air - to - surface missiles , 500lb free fall bombs , and @entity174 air - launched rockets			2
despite @entity2 attempts to retire the fleet , it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s			0
at one stage when the @entity2 suggested retiring its more than 300 a- 10s the @entity180 indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities			1
figures published in the @entity53 show that just one in four missions over the last three months actually involves dropping bombs or firing missiles			0
three - quarters of planes return to base without having deployed their armament			2
planners are concentrating on what they have called ‘ pop - up targets ’ - convoys of @entity4 fighters , or individual leaders – which are targeted as soon as they are identified by analysts			1
the deployment of @entity22 and @entity76 will increase the ability to take on such targets			2
both can circle slowly above target areas for hours at a time			0
in the case of a- 10s they can swoop as low as 50ft and maintain a presence above enemy positions at low speed			1
they are also heavily armoured against small - arms fire and rocket - propelled grenades and designed to keep flying while under fire			1
in @entity5 they have successfully targeted @entity39 positions just yards from @entity52 patrols and are admired by the @entity180 as a psychological weapon which keeps the @entity39 at bay			2
but much of the success – or failure – of the mission against @entity4 depends on the instructions pilots at the controls of the @entity22 will receive			2
such is the concern that the operation avoid civilian casualties which would hand @entity4 a propaganda victory that the list of targets is approved by the head of @entity231 , general @entity232			2
it is based on information from spy satellites , @entity237 spy aircraft flying at 70,000 feet above the @entity238 , and intelligence from the ground , where special forces are believed to be working , as well as the @entity242			0
one of his officers admitted in the @entity53 that the operation was fraught with difficulties			0
major @entity246 told the newspaper ’s @entity248 : ‘ when we target a nation - state , we ’ve typically been looking at their capability for decades and have extensive target sets			0
‘ but these guys are moving around			0
they can be in place , and then a week later , they ’re gone			0
’ @entity4 has now been under attack from the air for almost three months but continues to pump out propaganda and have control of territory in @entity12 and @entity13			1
president @entity262 has been facing calls for more radical action against them , with @entity266 senator @entity266 earlier this month arguing in favour of limited ‘ boots on the ground ’ to go after its leadership .			0

a dozen a- 10s are being moved from @entity5 to @entity6 by next week to start patrols over @entity12 and @entity13
*fearsome* planes can approach targets low and slow and are *protected* against small arms fire and @entity4 's favored weapons
more drones armed with missiles will patrol the skies within weeks as *war* on the @entity9 is *stepped* up
deployment comes after 200 commanders held talks on *defeating* @entity4 , which is half - army , half - insurgency
