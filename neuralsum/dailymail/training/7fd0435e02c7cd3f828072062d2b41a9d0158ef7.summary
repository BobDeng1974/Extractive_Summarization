a @entity2 quantum physicist who was tipped to win a nobel prize was killed just an hour after arriving in @entity4 by a joyrider high on cannabis , an inquest has heard			1
cancer survivor and charity volunteer dr @entity7 , 36 , was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by @entity9 jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi			1

she added that he believed his work , which included plans to build the world 's first quantum computer and mathematical analysis of cancer treatments , could ' change the world beyond all imagination '			1
he had recently recovered from cancer himself and was an active fundraiser for @entity69			1
originally from @entity71 but living in @entity72 at the time of his death , dr @entity7 's work took him all over the world and during his time in @entity4 he was due to give a speech at the @entity78 on quantum physics			1

a post-mortem concluded that he died at the scene from multiple injuries which were described as ' non-survivable '			0
reaching her conclusion , coroner @entity144 said that the risk of death was ' almost inevitable ' when @entity33 - who had a number of previous convictions and a history of drug addiction - got behind the wheel			2

' the speeds recorded range from 140 - 160kmh which is excessive to say the least			0
