the @entity109 economy was left in turmoil following the withdrawal of @entity112 at the end of the @entity114			0
attempts were made by the @entity12 administration to repair the country 's economy , as revenue from @entity122 's tin and rubber industries were important to @entity12 's own post-war recovery			0
however , food was scarce and expensive , wages were low and unemployment was high			0

a rescue party reached the crash site in early september 1950 after nine days journey on foot to discover all 12 had died			1
the bodies were buried near the crash site in a shallow grave because the difficult terrain and prevailing security situation placed the rescue party at severe risk of attack			1

in a remarkable stroke of luck , his request landed on the desk of a military officer at the @entity4 high commission in @entity70			1
colonel @entity176 ordered a full - scale expedition to be carried out to recover the remains of the warplane , and incredibly , the @entity181 ’s @entity180 located the wreckage			2

‘ we could have gone out before now but we had nowhere to visit			0
it is comforting that we now have a proper grave with a headstone			0
