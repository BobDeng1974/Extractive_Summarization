the contrast between this video and earlier islamic state propaganda could hardly be greater			2
until @entity5 ’s appearance yesterday , the @entity2 videos had shown a series of horrific beheadings			1
these included the last moments of @entity11 aid worker @entity10 and @entity14 journalists @entity12 and @entity15			1
each video ended with a chilling picture of the next hostage facing death			2
the victims were wearing orange jumpsuits , kneeling in the sand , with blue sky behind them			2
the knife - wielding figure of the @entity11 fanatic known as @entity27 was seen next to them as he ranted about @entity30 and @entity31			1
yesterday ’s video has no knives , no threats and no beheading			1
it was equally slick in production but a total contrast in style , almost like a parody of a @entity14 tv chat show – though still burdened with menace			1
contrast : yesterday ’s video has no knives , no threats and no beheading			1
it was equally slick in production but a total contrast in style , almost like a parody of a @entity14 tv chat show reference from a @entity54 song ? titles at the opening of the video declare ‘ @entity55 – message from @entity11 detainee @entity5			1
’ the choice of the phrase ‘ @entity55 ’ could be significant one			0
it was used in the @entity54 song with a @entity65 and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the @entity11 captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as @entity54			1
if so , it could be an attempt to poke fun at the @entity73 media and a signal that they are aware of , even enjoying , their own infamy			0
there is a further interpretation , however			0
the phrase was coined by @entity81 in @entity82 , where it opens a speech by @entity86 – a man who has been forced to speak words he does not believe in – but ultimately manages to convert a crowd to what he truly thinks			0
the scenario could be compared to that of @entity5 , who is being forced – in his words , with ‘ a gun to his head ’ – to speak words he presumably does not really believe			1
no clues in ' tv studio ' setting @entity5 is shown in the opening shot sitting indoors at a polished wooden table , his hands folded in front of him			1
unlike the previous videos where the ground and background have provided analysts with clues as to where it is , the images have been stripped of anything that could provide help to those wishing to find the hostages			2
for a man facing execution , the @entity115 appears remarkably calm , his words clearly spoken			0
introducing ‘ the detainee ’ @entity5 is not wearing the distinctive orange jumpsuits seen on his fellow captives – in a mocking imitation of those the @entity14 made terror suspects wear in @entity124			1
instead he is shown in a loose - fitting , round - neck orange top with elbow length sleeves			2
significantly , the word ‘ detainee ’ is used on screen in @entity130 and then @entity131 to describe the photographer			0
he is markedly thinner than when last pictured shortly after crossing the border back in the @entity134 from @entity135 in november 2012			0
his hair has been cropped short and he has a relatively well - kept beard and moustache			0
his hands show no scars and his fingernails appear cut and clean			2
there are no signs of the beatings many of the hostages have endured			0
deliberate ? the line @entity147 was used in a @entity54 song and could be seen as a twisted reference to the fact that the @entity11 captors responsible for the beheadings are said to be known as @entity54 was he using an autocue ? throughout the slick 3.21 minute video , posted on @entity156 , the @entity115 appears to be reading from an autocue			1
the speech was almost certainly written for him			0
while he often uses his hands like a tv reporter to emphasise a point – once putting his fingers to his head mimicking a gun – his eyes rarely wander from the screen in front of him			0
it is a method @entity2 had used successfully on the previous videos , especially when mr @entity10 , 44 , read a script fiercely criticising mr @entity31 shortly before the former @entity173 engineer was killed			0
sometimes , the camera zooms in close to @entity5 ’s face , before pulling back to a wider , rounded frame			1
it seems at least two cameras are used – indicating a level of sophistication in the production			0
hello , my name is @entity5 speaking calmly and clearly , he begins : ‘ hello , my name is @entity5			1
i ’m a @entity11 journalist who used to work for some of the bigger newspapers and magazines in the @entity11 , including the @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190			2
‘ in november 2012 i came to @entity134 , where i was subsequently captured by the @entity191			2
now , nearly two years later , many things have changed , including the expansion of the @entity191 to include large areas of @entity134 and @entity195 – a land mass bigger than @entity11 , and many other nations			1
’ introduction : speaking calmly and clearly , he begins : ‘ hello , my name is @entity5			2
i ’m a @entity11 journalist who used to work for some of the bigger newspapers and magazines in the @entity11 @entity202 ’s abandoned me unclasping his hands he continues : ‘ now , i know what you ’re thinking			2
you ’re thinking : “ he ’s only doing this because he ’s a prisoner he ’s got a gun at his head and he ’s being forced to do this , ” right ? well , it ’s true			0
‘ i am a prisoner , that i can not deny			0
but seeing as i ’ve been abandoned by my government and my fate now lies in the hand of the @entity191 i have nothing to lose			2
maybe i will live and maybe i will die , but i want to take this opportunity to convey some facts that you can verify , facts that if you contemplate might help in preserving lives			0
’ i ’ll be back with more messages @entity5 ’s voice remains clear and a constant tone as he unveils the video is the first of several planned by @entity2			1
he said : ‘ over the next few programmes i ’m going to show you the truth as the @entity73 media tries to drag the public back to the abyss of another war with the @entity191			1
after two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in @entity235 and @entity195 why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict ? ’ more messages : although mr @entity5 does not refer to it directly , he suggests he will reveal the ‘ truth ’ about why the @entity11 and @entity14 hostages were murdered you think you ’re told the truth ? as @entity5 winds - up his speech , he stresses : ‘ i ’m going to show you the truth behind the systems and motivation of the @entity191 , and how the @entity73 media – the very organisation i used to work – for can twist and manipulate that truth for the public back home			1
there are two sides to every story			0
think you ’re getting the whole picture ? ’ and although he does not refer to it directly , he suggests he will reveal the ‘ truth ’ about why the @entity11 and @entity14 hostages were murdered – suggesting it is the fault of @entity11 and @entity14 governments for not paying ransoms			1
‘ and i ’ll show you the truth behind what happened when many @entity267 citizens were imprisoned and later released by the @entity191 , and how the @entity11 and @entity14 governments thought they could do it differently to every other @entity267 country , ’ he says			1
‘ they negotiated with the @entity191 and got their people home , while the @entity11 and @entity14 were left behind			1
’ a warning to chill the blood @entity5 ’s chilling conclusion was remarked upon for its use of the word ‘ head ’ which some saw as a veiled reference to the threat of beheading hanging over the other hostages including @entity282			1
he concludes : ‘ it ’s very alarming to see where this is all headed and it looks like history repeating itself , yet again			0
’ but he suggests that the public can ‘ change ’ the course of events – though it is not clear how			0
‘ there is time to change this seemingly inevitable sequence of events , but only if you , the public act now , ’ he says			0
‘ join me for the next few programmes , and i think you may be surprised at what you learn			0
’ the screen then turns to black .			0

recent @entity191 videos had shown a series of horrific beheadings
victims were in the desert with @entity11 fanatic @entity27 next to them
video of @entity5 had no knives , no threats and no beheadings
the contrasting style was almost like a parody of a @entity14 tv chat show
but the video , released yesterday , contained a warning to chill the blood
