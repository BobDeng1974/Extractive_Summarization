for more than two centuries it has been respected around the world as a sign of @entity5 ’s greatness			1
now the @entity6 , the nation ’s proudest symbol , is poised to get a history - making new look – minus the @entity11 saltire			2
secret @entity14 papers propose ditching the cross of @entity16 , a white x on a blue background , that makes up a third of the current design if @entity11 votes for independence , the @entity21 can reveal today			1
banishing the blue : how the new @entity6 will look , according to secret @entity14 documents iconic : the flag that has been famous for more than 200 years that would leave a modified @entity6 comprising only the red cross of @entity29 – representing @entity30 and @entity31 – and the red saltire of @entity34 ’s @entity33			1
the dramatic change to our national flag – the first since 1801 , when @entity33 ’s cross was added – was accidentally revealed in confidential papers carried by a @entity14 adviser in @entity42			1
briefing notes seen as he stepped from a ministerial car show a detailed design for the new flag and appear to list strategies for introducing it post-referendum			1
the @entity21 can confirm that the @entity52 - free flag is already in production at @entity5 ’s longest - established producer			2
undercover pictures taken inside @entity56 of @entity57 , @entity58 , show a red and white design exactly as described on the @entity42 papers			1
flagged up : an aide accidentally shows papers detailing the plan as he steps out of a car manufacture is going ahead despite the fact that no vote will be held on @entity11 independence until september 18 , and no decision has been made in @entity11 yet on whether to keep the @entity6 or use only the @entity11 saltire			2
machine - room workers at @entity56 are believed to have produced hundreds of scot - free versions and are confident they can meet demand if necessary			0
changing the flag would need both political and royal approval			0
it is understood the @entity42 strategy maps out a timeline to include liaising with @entity80			0
the race to get everything completed inside six months began after experts at the @entity84 , an advisory charity , released a set of possible designs for a post-independence flag six weeks ago			0
a survey last year found nearly 65 per cent would be in favour of the change in the event of a @entity93 vote			0
but the haste with which the government is anticipating ditching the saltire is bound to cause outrage among no vote supporters			0
yesterday @entity5 - ok organisers in @entity11 told the @entity21 they would ‘ fight to the end ’ to save the @entity6 and resist any moves to make @entity11 a saltire - only zone			1
campaigner @entity104 explained : ‘ there is no constitutional need to change the flag , and no justification whatsoever for @entity42 to hatch a policy in secret to do so			2
no one removed the cross of @entity33 from the flag when the @entity114 was created in 1922			0
why take the saltire off now ? ’			0

symbol has represented @entity5 for two centuries and is respected *globally*
plans would see the cross of @entity16 ditched from the design
would be the first change since 1801 , when @entity34 *'s* red saltire was added
