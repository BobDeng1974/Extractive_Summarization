he was livid , spinning towards @entity1 and telling the fourth official exactly why @entity3 should n’t have been able to crash home the late winner			2
@entity6 then grumpily crossed his arms in acceptance			1
referees are going to get to know this man over the next two months			0
on his first public outing in @entity12 , @entity6 was nothing if not eccentric , incapable of remaining still for longer than a few seconds			1
his gesticulations were constant , nervous energy overt			0
staying slumped in his cushy @entity17 dug out just was n’t an option for the @entity20 coach			2
keeping @entity20 up looks like being the pensioner ’s toughest job in a long managerial career and — despite an understated entrance to the @entity25 in which no photographer deemed it necessary to capture an image of him before kick - off — @entity6 felt the need to show those loyal band of travelling supporters in the sir @entity33 stand that he means business			1
@entity6 was left disappointed as @entity20 fell to a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity36 in his first game in charge @entity36 striker @entity3 smashes in a late winner to give his side their first win in 13 league games @entity36 's @entity43 ( centre ) tussles with @entity20 's @entity45 ( left ) and @entity46 ( right ) the @entity47 may only have the job for nine matches but he is insistent on stamping his authority on a rag - tag squad who would not fight for previous incumbent @entity53			1
the signs are positive for the struggling club and @entity6 must surely have left east @entity56 with a sense of satisfaction that his message has been heeded in a matter of days , even if his team failed to hold out			1
@entity6 is acutely aware that his body language resonates with those wearing the club ’s colours before him			2
even at 67 , the basics still enthuse him			0
@entity67 , normally little more than a luxury midfielder , was one shining example of the difference between @entity53 and now			0
@entity20 playmaker @entity67 ( right ) tussles for the ball with @entity36 midfielder @entity73 ( left ) @entity6 controversially included @entity20 winger @entity74 among his substitutes at @entity17 @entity74 , who is currently on bail from sexual assault charges , was met by a chorus of boos from the crowd @entity6 almost leapt in celebration when @entity67 left his central station to shut down @entity83 during what appeared an innocuous patch of play			1
for him , that epitomised tangible change amid the serious problems he inherited			0
the second , of course , is finding someone who can actually stick the ball in the net			0
one goal in seven games , dating back to february 7 , is laughably abysmal			0
so it was understandable that @entity6 opted for three up front in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
less cautious than fellow countryman @entity103 but every bit as passionate , he clasped his ears in frustration at @entity102 ’s galling , first - half miss. @entity6 looked as if he was living on the edge , a characteristic typified by introducing @entity74 with 17 minutes remaining			1
the winger , recalled from suspension , was booed and subjected to a volley of disparaging chants , but that matters little to his manager			0
results are paramount from now until may 24			0
@entity6 will try to earn those wins while hopping about on the touchline			2
@entity6 faces a difficult challenge to keep @entity20 in the @entity25 and has eight games to do it			1

@entity6 lost his first game in charge of @entity20 1 - 0 to @entity36
@entity6 has been appointed at @entity20 until the end of the *season*
the @entity47 is *tasked* with keeping the @entity20 in the @entity25
despite the defeat , his attacking *tactics* and selection were positive
