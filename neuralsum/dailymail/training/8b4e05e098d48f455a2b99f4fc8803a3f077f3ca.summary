duty : @entity2 headmaster @entity1 a @entity4 headteacher reported an a-level student to police and informed the university he had applied for that the teenager had succumbed to ' violent extremism ' after he criticised the school in a blog			1
@entity1 , the headmaster of @entity2 , told 19 - year - old @entity13 never to return to the school grounds again after he set up a website attacking the way it was run			1
and he informed the school 's on - site policemen and @entity19 , where mr @entity13 hoped to take a degree , that the student could be ' developing into an anarchist			1
the @entity23 , which mr @entity13 started in february , contained a series of colourfully - worded articles that likened the school staff to characters in @entity29 's anti-totalitarian novels - most notably casting mr @entity1 in the role of @entity32 's chief pig , @entity33			1
in a style that he likened to that of the irreverent satirical magazine @entity37 , the young blogger accused the school of failing to push @entity39 results any higher , a lack of investment in musical instruments and gym equipment , and of not listening to pupils ' views			2
mr @entity1 confirmed yesterday that he had blocked the blog from school computers in april and condemned the articles as ' mad writings '			1
he said he had ' major concerns and was duty bound under legal acts for the prevention of violent extremism ' and that he was ' erring on the side of caution ' in taking action			1
' it is fairly worrying stuff , ' he added			2
mr @entity60 said he was particularly concerned ' that @entity13 has mentioned the ideologies of anarchism and individualism on this blog '			1
' i must do something , ' he said			2
' in the last year he has become more and more enchanted by anti-establishment ways of thinking and has even said that there is an inherent risk that every government is corrupt			2
' i am not an expert in these matters but i had training in how to look for things that might need a second opinion			0
i did n’t think it was illegal but the undertones towards the end made me think - does this need a second opinion ? " the school claims again and again that it listens to students needs and that it takes into consideration what students say and care about			0
this is utter horses * * *			0
so much horses * * * indeed , that findus ’ lasagne is bewildered " @entity89 , the @entity23 ' i phoned @entity19 to warn them what sort of person they were dealing with , to advise them that this person thinks thoughts like these , and they could then make an informed decision			1
' i am duty bound to do that			1
' the headteacher added : ' i also reported what he had written to the police , and the officer i spoke to said he would pass these mad writings of his on to a colleague			0
' neither mr @entity1 nor mr @entity13 has since heard from police			1
the north - west @entity4 school caters for around 1,300 pupils , with former students including novelist @entity112 , women ’s @entity114 international footballer @entity113 and actress @entity116			0
the blog is now being updated by another , anonymous student as mr @entity13 has left the school			1
trash : a post from mr @entity13 's blog , run along with several students , which slammed the school management using the fruitiest of language in his final post on the blog , mr @entity13 wrote : ' this past year , i have become more and more enchanted by the ideology of anarchism and individualism			1
' he added : ' i am not hailing anarchism as the only way of life , just pointing out that any type of government has the risk of being corrupt and vile			0
' mr @entity13 said he had been summoned to the headteacher ’s office on his last day and interrogated about his articles , before he was warned never return to the school site - even to pick up his a-level exam results - because the work was ' offensive '			1
one article that caused particular trouble commented that the school was ' playing the school league tables ' in terms of how results were presented			0
it claimed there were tensions among staff members about the way the school was run , outlined in phrases such as : ' @entity158 , f * * * you			2
' another article read : ' the school claims again and again that it listens to students needs and that it takes into consideration what students say and care about			0
this is utter horses * * *			0
so much horses * * * indeed , that findus ’ lasagne is bewildered ' - referring to the scandal earlier last year , when ready meals were found to contain horse meat			0
school for scandal : @entity2 in @entity174 , north @entity4 , teaches around 1,300 pupils the article went on : ' the school magazine is not worth the paper it is printed on and does s * * * all to voice student consensus			1
' mr @entity13 , who did not get the grades he needed to get into @entity19 and will be studying mathematics at @entity183 , said : ' they said i had brought the school into disrepute			1
i said that was their opinion , but nothing i had done was illegal so why such severe action ? ' i was prepared to apologise for the language			0
but what worries me is if i had been a year younger they said they would have expelled me halfway through my a-levels , and that means they would have been prepared to ruin my education because they did n’t like my thoughts			0
' it was useless to call the police because i did n’t break the law			0
' i was concerned he ’d called @entity19 because i ’m worried he would go to those lengths of intimidation to control a student ’s thoughts			2
but i was n’t too panicked because it turned out i did n’t have the grades to get in there anyway			0
' " i phoned @entity19 to warn them what sort of person they were dealing with , to advise them that this person thinks thoughts like these , and they could then make an informed decision			0
i am duty bound to do that			1
" @entity1 , @entity2 headmaster mr @entity13 , who co-founded a debating society at the school , compared his treatment to those fighting for press freedom in the @entity231			1
he said : ' obviously it ’s not on the same scale at all , this injustice is small , i know that			0
but my family are from @entity237 so i know how things work there , and newspapers are not allowed to write what they want			0
' everybody is controlled , and i can see that happening here			0
it reminds me of @entity245 [ a totalitarian government in the @entity29 novel @entity248 ] , people must conform or they are out			2
' when he blocked the blog from the school ’s computers that was bizarre			1
how does he find the time to go round doing things like that ? ' mr @entity1 defended his actions , saying : ' he posted lies about the school and i will not tolerate that			1
' his posts were scattered with the f - word and c - word and if a student spoke like that in school they would be expelled			2
so of course i blocked the blog , and told him never to come back			2
' he ’s right , if he had been younger , he would have been expelled			0
' it would have been his responsibility that he ruined his education , not mine			0
' he added that if mr @entity13 had not used bad language he would still have warranted an expulsion ' for his mad ideas and ranting '			2
mr @entity13 said he wanted to thank ' a lot of the very good teachers at @entity2 ' but felt they were not given the chance to ' teach the way they want to '			1
