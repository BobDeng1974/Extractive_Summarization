by @entity0 @entity2 prices have grown at their fastest pace since the financial crisis , fuelling fears that the help to buy scheme is inflating a new property bubble			1
in the latest sign of recovery in the housing market , an influential report from @entity10 has found that three quarters of postcodes registered price gains this year			1
this is up from just a fifth last year			0
across @entity19 and @entity20 , average prices rose by 4.4 per cent to £ 206,726 – the highest registered by @entity10 since october 2007 and a rebound from last year ’s 0.3 per cent fall			1
house prices have grown at their fastest pace since the financial crisis , fuelling fears that the help to buy scheme is inflating a new property bubble by far the biggest gains were in @entity29 and the south east , with average prices growing 9.1 per cent and 5 per cent respectively			1
the average price of a house in @entity29 is now £ 422,860 , and @entity32 has the next highest average at £ 340,333			1
demand for housing also soared by 25 per cent , the fastest pace for three years , while the supply of new homes fell to a record low , increasing just 6 per cent			0
the report said it expected ‘ the momentum in house price growth to spill over into 2014 by a continued lack of supply and rising demand ’			2
the huge inbalance lends weight to concerns that the housing market is overheating following the introduction of the government ’s help to @entity53 in april , which was launched to help those with small deposits get their foot on the property ladder			0
but over the next fortnight leading forecasters are expected to show that the housing market has been turbo - charged by the help to buy scheme and a glut of cheap mortgage deals			0
@entity66 ’s latest index is expected to show prices rose 8.1 per cent in the year to december , the fastest since october 2007			1
meanwhile , @entity68 is set to predict growth of 7.1 per cent , which would be the best since june 2010			0
this raft of data is likely to be latched on by critics of @entity61 to buy , ranging from business secretary @entity74 to former @entity76 governor @entity75			0
they argue that help to buy is artificially driving up house prices – particularly in @entity29 and the south east – because there are not enough homes to cope with soaring demand			0

it fears a repeat of the massive build - up of household debt before 2008 , which contributed to the financial crisis			2
but supporters of the scheme – including @entity97 – have played down the @entity10 report shows a stark north - south divide in the housing market			1
the north was the only region to see a drop in prices , of 0.5 per cent , while homeowners in the north east experienced an average rise of just 0.5 per cent			1
in @entity109 the average house is now £ 149,300 and in @entity110 it is £ 141,400			2
