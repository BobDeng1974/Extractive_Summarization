@entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , 17 hours ago why is it when you look into the eyes of people who do these crime it looks like no one is in there ! @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity113 , 17 hours ago he should have got far far longer , but should she have got more than a certain politicians now ex ? @entity126 , @entity127 , 17 hours ago if you are caught driving whilst disqualified it should be an automatic 5 year prison sentence			2
disgusting waste of oxygen , and she 's no better for covering up for so long ! - @entity133 , @entity134 , 23/09/2013 15:52 what a well thought out idea			0
why not the death penalty for speeding while we are at it			2
all that your ill thought out idea would do is prevent anyone pulling over or stopping for any offense if it applied to them			0
killing more people in car chases			0
nobody stops if it means 5 years in jail			2
it is lucky that laws are generally considered from all angles and not reactionaries			0
ozzy , st albans , 18 hours ago scum @entity159 , @entity160 , 18 hours ago but has he been charged for dangerous driving or driving without a license ? @entity164 , @entity165 , 18 hours ago @entity166 please get some answers			2
why the disgustingly lenient sentence ? mark , deal , uk , 18 hours ago surely the prison sentence and the ban should be appealed as being unduly lenient			0
@entity173 , @entity112 , 18 hours ago four years ? ? seriously ? ? this country is a joke ! ! @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity113 , 18 hours ago has there not been a precedent for this sort of thing , set by a member of parliament in recent times , re. swapping places in the car ? @entity186 , @entity113 , 18 hours ago the sentence does not reflect the crime			0
why only 12 months ban ? the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity194			0
