an 11,500 - year - old grave containing the remains of three infants has been discovered in @entity3			1
the babies had been buried by @entity6 's earliest inhabitants - ' @entity7 ' - who crossed over a land bridge from @entity10 called @entity11 , which existed at the end of the last @entity13			1
early tools found on the continent were also found alongside the babies ' remains			1
the babies had been buried by @entity6 's earliest inhabitants - ' @entity7 ' - who crossed over a land bridge from @entity10 that existed at the end of the last @entity13 it is thought that small groups of hunter - gatherers migrated with herds of large animals and travelled around @entity3			1
the skeleton of a three - year - old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at @entity32 in the @entity33 lowlands forest in central @entity3 and had been cremated			1
now , excavations have revealed the skeletons of two more infants in a circular pit about 15 inches ( 38cm ) below the other child , who was buried beneath the remains of a ' seasonal ' house			1
experts claim that the first infant died shortly after birth and the other was a late - term foetus			1
it 's possible they could have been twins			2
anthropologist @entity48 and his team at @entity50 said the discovery offers a rare opportunity to learn how @entity6 's first settlers dealt with the deaths of their young			1
the skeleton of a three - year - old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at @entity32 in the @entity33 lowlands forest in central @entity3 ( marked at a ) and had been cremated @entity7 were the first people who entered and inhabited the @entity61 continents during the first glacial episodes of the late @entity64 period			1
experts think they crossed the @entity66 from @entity67 into @entity6 over a land bridge called @entity11 that existed between 47,000 and 14,000 years ago			2
small , isolated groups of the hunter gatherers and big game hunters migrated with herds of large herbivores into the heart of @entity3			2
stone tools - especially projectile points and scrapers - are evidence of the earliest human activity in the @entity80			1
the burial site also shows that ancient residents of @entity3 foraged for fish , birds and small mammals , as well as large game			2
scientists believe the house was occupied in summer based on the bones from salmon and immature ground squirrels found there			2
dr @entity48 said the infant skeletons were largely complete			2
the first was lying face up with knees tightly flexed towards the chest			0
the child 's left arm was flexed across the chest with hand near the chin and the right arm extended across the torso to the left			2
the foetus seems to have originally been placed upright with knees also tightly flexed			0
but when discovered , the torso was prone over the legs and the left arm extended beside the back and behind the pelvis			0
@entity112 projectile points and associated decorated antler foreshafts were discovered in the burial pit at the @entity116 site			0
they were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in @entity6 scientists believe the house under which the remains were buried , was occupied in summer based on the bones from salmon ( stock image left ) and immature ground squirrels ( right ) found there goods placed in the grave consisted of four antler rods decorated with abstract incised lined and two spear points placed parallel to each other and adjacent to the foetus			1
a third stone tool was placed next to the rods			0
they were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in @entity6			1
' the presence of hafted points may reflect the importance of hunting implements in the burial ceremony and with the population as whole , ' the paper says			0
dr @entity48 said domestic activities would have included hunting of salmon , small mammals and birds along with large mammals further afield			0
the human remains and associated burial offerings - as well as inferences about the time of year the children died and were buried - could lead to new thinking about how early societies were structured			1
they could also shed light upon the stresses they faced as they tried to survive , how they treated the youngest members of their society , as well as how they viewed death and the importance of rituals associated with it			0
' taken collectively , these burials and cremation reflect complex behaviours related to death among the early inhabitants of @entity6 , ' dr @entity48 said			1
dr @entity48 said : ' the infants and grave goods were placed in the bottom of the pit which was immediately backfilled with sediment containing a small quantity of burned fish and small mammal specimens from earlier consumption events			0
' if individuals one and two were twins , the former survived birth for at least five weeks whereas the latter died earlier in utero			1
' so the two were not interred together during a single burial event			0
individual one was clearly a primary interment			0
thus it is possible individual two represents a secondary burial - placed in the pit after individual one died			2
this scenario could explain the different positions			0
' he said the three year - old died later and was cremated in the residential hearth			1
@entity203 professors @entity48 and @entity204 excavate the burial pit at the @entity116 site			0
they discovered skeletons as well as decorated stone tools professor @entity210 from @entity212 @entity211 , was involved in the study			2
he examined dental and skeletal remains to determine the probable age and other information about the infants			0
for the double burial , he estimated the times of death and said that one survived birth by a few weeks , while the other died in the womb			0
according to professor @entity225 , ' the deaths are consistent with high levels of childhood death in highly mobile hunter – gatherers , which have been reported to be as high as 45 per cent in recent arctic / subarctic groups			0
' however , he also said that ' the nearly concurrent deaths of two infants and a child could have been more harmful than usual to the small group regarding long - term demographic effects , if additional births did not occur relatively soon			1
' the artifacts — including the projectile points and plant and animal remains — may also help to build a more complete picture of early human societies and how they were structured , as well as how they survived climate changes at the end of the last great @entity13 , the team said			0
the presence of two burial events — the buried infants and cremated child — within the same dwelling could also indicate relatively longer - term residential occupation of the site than previously expected			1
the remains of salmon - like fish and ground squirrels in the burial pit indicate that the site was likely occupied by hunter - gatherers between june and august			0
' the deaths occurred during the summer , a time period when regional resource abundance and diversity was high and nutritional stress should be low , suggesting higher levels of mortality than may be expected give our current understanding ' of survival strategies of the period , the authors wrote .			0

babies were buried by @entity6 's earliest inhabitants - ' @entity7 '
early tools were also found beside the remains of the infants in @entity3
one child was cremated and the skeletons of two others - who may have been twins - were found *underneath* the ruins of a ' seasonal house '
first infant died shortly after birth , and the other was a late - term foetus
