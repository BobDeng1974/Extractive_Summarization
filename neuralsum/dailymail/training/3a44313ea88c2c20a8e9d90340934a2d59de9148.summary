by @entity0 they had only been in their new enclosure for two weeks , but these polar bears were intent on making their presence known			2
so when a white peacock swooped into their territory at @entity10 's @entity9 in @entity11 , it was n't long before one bear had the bird in its sights			1
captured on video , visitors watched in horror as @entity18 , the female polar bear , caught the helpless animal , bit into its neck and viciously tore it apart			0
the bird initially tried to fly away , but did n't clear the wall and dropped back into the water , where the bear was waiting , delighted with the treat , @entity18 ran around the cage with it to stop her mate @entity46 getting a share of the catch			1
she then consumed the bird , leaving a trail of bloody white feathers in her wake			0
selfish : she then runs off with the bird in a bid to stop her mate @entity46 from getting a share of the meal flea : @entity18 continues her escape with the feathers of the bird spread out of her mouth now there are fears for the zoos remaining three peacocks who have been seen flying into the polar bear enclosure apparently looking for their missing pal			1
zoo visitor @entity70 said : ' the other white peacock stands on the wall of the polar bear enclosure calling all the time for its missing pal , it is really sad			1
' the birds made themselves at home there during the past year when the polar bear enclosure was renovated and had no any predators			0
now the fear is that the others may fly into their deaths , including the only remaining white peacock			0
dinner : the bears emerge from behind a rock with @entity18 dragging the peacock while clasped in its teeth scrap : the pair had only been in their enclosure for two weeks before one attacked the helpless bird terrifying : visitors watched in shock as the polar bear continued to walk around the enclosure with white feathers hanging from its mouth the @entity104 peacock suffers from @entity105 , a defect which turns pigment cells that turn them into feathered albinos			1
the polar bears were brought to @entity10 only two weeks ago after spending the last two years in the @entity111 and @entity112 while the renovations on their enclosure were carried out			2
in the meantime , the peacocks had been allowed to fly into their empty cage , a luxury that was later to cost the life of at least one of them after he failed to notice the cage 's new arrivals			0
hungry : @entity46 follows his mate in a bid to get the remaining parts of the catch remains : feathers lay scattered over the floor of the enclosure as the bear continues to eat the peacock			0
