@entity1 's two sons have grown up in a world of immense privilege			1
@entity4 , 17 , and @entity5 , 15 , will never want for material items and have a good chance of extremely successful careers ahead of them through their network of family contacts			2
it is is something that @entity1 , a tireless campaigner for reufgees throughout the world in her role as a @entity20 @entity19 ambassador , never fails to remind them			1
the 40 - year - old has revealed that she is constantly aware of how lucky her children have it while she is visiting conflict zones and coming across boys who are the same age			1
one of the first moments of realisation came when she was distributing supplies to a refugee camp in @entity44 13 years ago			2
speaking on the @entity46 show earlier today , she said : ' i met this seven - year - old boy , who was just a little bit older than my own son			2
' it ’s really hard not to make those comparisons			2
' i ’d taken tents in ( to this camp ) to distribute because the @entity44 government were not recognising them as refugees and allowing the aid charities to go in			2
' it was during the monsoon and it was the most terrible situation			0
' this seven year old boy was trying to put a 25 kilo ( four stone ) tent on his back and i went up to him and said , “ get one of your family members to help you , get the head of the household			0
” ' he explained that he was the head of the household - his mother had died in the camp , his father had died in the fighting , but more than that , he had four younger siblings that he was caring for , including a tiny baby			1
@entity1 appeared on @entity46 today to talk about her campaign ' this 7 year old boy had taken on the responsibility of an adult and when i thought about my seven - year - old son who could barely run a bath unsupervised at that point , you see this huge difference			1
' when you meet a child like that who is seven years old and has no concept of what being a normal child is like , that really affected me			0
' @entity1 experienced a similar situation more recently , while visiting a @entity32 refugee camp in @entity97			1
the heiress has revealed she came into contact with a teenager who was the same age as her eldest son , who made her realise how much her boys take their opportunities for granted			2
she said : ' i ’ve just been to the @entity32 refugee camp in @entity97 and the situation is very desperate			1
' the child that captures my imagination is the one that is the same age as my child now , so when i was in @entity32 in @entity97 in the refugee camp this time , there was this 17 year old boy			1
' i have a 17 year old boy and a 15 year old boy now			0
' this 17 year old boy - his greatest wish in life was to be able to go to school , but he was having to go to work to support his family			0
' he was having to do this menial work , but he was desperate to become a civil engineer			0
' he was this serious boy who does n’t watch tv , who was quite politicised and very gentle , but all he wanted was to be able to go to school and to be able to go to university ' and i think about my kids and how i have to employ every tactic available to get them to do their homework , how lucky they are and how complacent they are about the immense privilege that they grow up in			0
' these experiences are two of many that convinced @entity1 to spearhead the @entity139 with @entity20 to raise money for children in @entity32			1
she said : ' i ’ve been working for @entity20 for thirteen years now , it happened after i ’d been to the refugee camp in @entity44			1
@entity144 and @entity145 have both participated in the # wakeupcall selfie ' when i set up an appeal for those children , @entity20 approached me and said that they do that in every conflict zone , so i ’ve been working with them for some time			1
' in terms of this ( @entity34 selfie campaign ) being about @entity32 , i feel that we ’ve been focusing on the military heavily and i want to put the humanitarian side back into the focus			1
' there are 6.5 million children who are now in real desperate need			2
' she is hoping that people will be inspired to get involved with the craze in a similar way to the ice bucket challenge and the no make - up selfie			2
she said : ' i hope it will catch on with the public , because the eye make - up challenge and the ice bucket challenge did so well			0
you just have to take a selfie when you ’ve just woken up , post it on social media with the hashtag # wakeupcall , donate money to @entity20 and then nominate three other people			1
' @entity177 and @entity178 have also contributed pictures of themselves waking up in the morning the campaign has been popular among celebrities recently , but has had some backlash among members of the public who have criticised the idea of fame - hungry stars wanting more exposure on social media			0
but @entity1 defended those celebrities , revealing it is actually all her fault			1
she said : ' i know that people get irritated by these campaigns			0
they think it ’s about narcissistic celebs just wanting to put pics of themselves on social media			0
but the truth is , what ’s really unfair is most of those people who ’ve done it so far have been begged by me			0
people like @entity178 – i had to beg her to do it , she does n’t do selfies , she just talks about cooking on @entity207			0
she said it was too cheesy and forced and i had to beg her to do it , so i feel really bad for them when everyone goes , “ ugh , these celebrities just want to do this to get their face on social media			0
