by @entity0 the @entity1 , led by @entity2 , pictured , carry out random acts of kindness across @entity5 and @entity6 they quiz subway passengers in @entity5 for cash prizes , with questions including ' what colour is the sky ? '			1
it 's members hand out free pizza to strangers and tape dollar bills to street signs beneath the tempting message , ' @entity20 '			1
sound too good to be true ? the @entity1 say there is no hidden agenda , no mailing list and no religious message - they thrive off the buzz of putting a smile on someone 's face			0
led by 23 - year - old @entity2 , members of the not - for - profit organisation , are bringing their random acts of kindness to the @entity33 , expanding from their @entity5 base			1
since its creation , the network has raised thousands of dollars in donations , and attracting intrigue and new members across @entity6			0
but @entity33 domination is just the tip of the iceberg , with the network aiming to open branches all across the world mr @entity2 , who hails from @entity46 in @entity47 , said : ' i do n't want it to be a charity , i just want to invoke a sense of kindness			2
' kindness has nothing to do with money - who 's doing stuff for the people who have money but might be unhappy ? ' our tag line is it does n't matter if you live on the street or if you own it , we have something for you			2
' but he said , in spite of the positive , feel - good factor they promote , members of the group routinely face rejection from the public , who turn down the offer of free money or food , assuming it is too good to be true			0
members tour the subway in @entity5 , quizzing passengers , challenging them with questions including , ' what colour is the sky ? ' in return for cash prizes members of the network tape dollar bills to street signs , underneath the tempting message , ' grab one ! '			1
and in another random act of kindness the do - gooders are often spotted handing out free food			0
the network is planning to expand its kind - hearted gestures , starting a branch in the @entity33 but rather than discourage the do - gooders , who dress in branded @entity1 t - shirts , it is that skepticism that fuels their determination			1
mr @entity2 added : ' the point where i 'll say i 'm happy will be when the entire world knows who we are and what we do , and recognises our logo			0
' i want to get to where @entity111 or @entity112 is , where you see the @entity1 smiley face logo with the tongue and think , i might be in a bad mood so i will change that			0
