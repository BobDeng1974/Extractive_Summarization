by @entity0 flashing a big smile on @entity6 ’s @entity5 earlier this week , @entity2 mum and @entity3 star @entity3 demonstrated all her usual zest and warmth , despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy for cancer			1
but as well as her dazzling white teeth , the 65 - year - old also showed off a dazzling halo of silver - white hair			1
fans quickly took to @entity16 to congratulate the former chocolatey brunette on her new ‘ silver vixen ’ status			1
@entity3 ’s been fortunate not to have lost her hair and it ’s almost certainly white because women are advised to avoid dying it until six months after finishing chemo			1
this is because hair is more fragile and the scalp more sensitive during this time			1
but even as i was applauding @entity3 ’s courage , i could n’t help thinking that the moment she gets the go - ahead she ’ll be back to her hairdresser faster than you can say ‘ @entity35 ’ , demanding a return to her tinted natural self			1
if you ’re wondering how you can possibly be both ‘ tinted ’ and ‘ natural ’ , let me assure you that you can			2
the hair colour a woman enjoys in her youth — whether brunette or blonde or auburn — is so often inextricably tied up with her identity			1
it is these shades that define who we are , not the grey that tries to colonise faster than @entity50 knotweed			2
silver vixen : @entity3 this week i discovered this for myself when i underwent a tortuous six - month experiment to grow out my roots after tinting my hair from the age of 27 until my mid- 50s			1
my visits to my colourist every three weeks had ruled my diary and depleted my bank balance for decades , and i had hoped going colour - free would free me — but my main realisation was that the ‘ grey me ’ was an ugly alien i did n’t recognise			2
the ‘ real me ’ , the brunette , had walked away , leaving me bereft			2
there was a moment , with my roots grown out to badger stripe stage , when for the first time in my life , a young man offered me his seat on the train			2
@entity72 ? i wanted to beat him around the head with my handbag			0
instead i smiled and sat down , defeated			0
the old cliché about grey - haired men looking distinguished while grey - haired women just look old is depressing , but the sad fact is that it ’s as true today as ever			1
when i cast my eyes across the roll - call of grey - haired female celebrities i find myself wishing that they would all do themselves a favour and reach for the tint			0
@entity85 looks haggard , the formidable @entity86 looks as though a wisp of wind would blow her away and @entity89 resembles a dowager — a shame given that she can still high - kick like a @entity93			1
@entity97 , with her blonde bits , grey fringe and variable roots merely looks confused , which for a government minister does n’t exactly inspire confidence			0
and while @entity102 ’s crisp crop suits her , she could look less fearsome and more youthful with some highlights			0
meanwhile , the likes of @entity105 and @entity106 look even more devastatingly attractive with a sprinkling of silver			1
by the age of 50 , around half of all white women are likely to have grey hair admittedly , some men have wobbly moments when they first turn grey			1
when my partner of five years , @entity116 , now 59 , was in his early 40s and already more silver than average , he was tempted by a bottle of @entity119 in boots			1
‘ i suppose i just felt a bit too young to be grey , ’ he explained			0
he waited until he went on holiday before trying it , knowing he would n’t bump into anyone he knew			0
‘ actually the results were quite good , ’ he says , ‘ but i washed it out again as soon as possible because i really did n’t like the idea of anyone noticing it			0
’ another man i know — tall , good - looking and close to 50 — admitted he was worried about grey around his temples			0
despite being the boss of a team of computer programmers , he was about 20 years older than most of his staff and felt he must look like an old man in their presence			0
but at no point did he question the effect his hair would have on his success on the dating scene			1
as a newly - divorced man , he was as confident as he ever was with his dark locks			0
so while grey hair can be an issue for today ’s metrosexual men , and hairdressers report that growing numbers of men are dyeing their hair , it hardly seems to worry most			1
this probably has to do with the fact that men remain fertile for longer — when a woman goes grey it signals the end of her fecundity , while it does n’t have to for men — and men are programmed to seek out those who are able to reproduce			0
add in the cultural pressures on women to stay young and beautiful , and grey - haired women are playing a losing game			1
battling the signs of aging : @entity0 fighting the grey as a feminist i feel i should be waving banners for the glad - to - be - grey sisterhood , but i ’m not sure i ’d find many sisters to join me			1
the home hair - colouring market was worth £ 350 million in 2013 say researchers @entity175 , with about half of products used by the 40 - 60 age group — a spend 4.5 per cent up on 2012			1
when , five years ago , i started my experiment to grow out my roots , friends thought i was nuts			0
this was especially so because it came within a year of separating from my husband and only weeks after having embarked on a new relationship with someone who took me on as a brunette			0
but given that @entity116 , my new man , was himself grey - haired , i thought it might prove a good test of what he really thought of me			0
as it turned out , he was patient and tried to be complimentary			0
he also breathed a big sigh of relief when i went back on the bottle — of tint , that is			2
what did i learn from this torture , apart from the fact that time and money could be saved ? that unless you have thick , bouncy hair ( mine is fine and as bouncy as lead ) , you ’ll look a great many years older than you did before			2
that unless your hair grows close to white , hair the colour of scaffolding will make your features look grey as well			2
that if you do n’t have masses of confidence in your looks , grey hair will make you feel invisible			2
it ’s one of the injustices between the sexes that a woman ’s chances of meeting someone will be diminished if she presents herself as grey , bad news for the increasing number of over- 50s who ’ve turned to online dating			0
one 50 - something acquaintance , already grey - haired , posted her profile and got scant response			0
when she dyed her hair and posted a new picture , the response rate went right up			2
soon she was dating a handsome grey - haired man			0
there are a number of women , following chemotherapy , who are so grateful to be still alive , and to see their hair growing back at all , that they wear their grey locks almost as a badge of victory			1
but i know plenty who find that dyeing their hair again gives them a boost of confidence			2
and that ’s why i ’m betting that @entity3 will be a re-minted brunette in the very near future			1
as for me , the tyranny of the tint seems a small price to pay for feeling better about myself			0
which is why i intend to keep on dyeing until the day i die .			0
