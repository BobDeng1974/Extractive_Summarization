by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , once of @entity3 and @entity4 , sported a thick beard and @entity7 haircut a la @entity8 in @entity9			0
the @entity11 midfielder arrived in @entity12 in 2010 with a full head of hair but within weeks , he had shaved it all off			0
the reason @entity2 gave for taking drastic action was he had seen a picture of himself in a paper and did not like how he looked			0
you talkin ' to him ? @entity2 ' hair is reminiscent of @entity22 's in @entity9 ( right ) @entity24 's reaction to @entity26 ’s flick of the arm may have drawn fierce criticism but what of the reaction from the @entity32 bench when the red card was shown ? television cameras caught a number of @entity37 ’s assistants and players celebrating and punching the air when @entity26 received his marching orders			1
surely that crosses the boundaries of sporting behaviour ? @entity44 may be one of the least heralded members of @entity32 ’s squad but his name will be familiar to @entity49 supporters			1
@entity49 signed him in the summer of 2009 as a player for the future but he only made one substitute appearance — in a dead - rubber @entity54 game against @entity55 — before he left in january 2012			0
he now plays for @entity56 in @entity57			0
@entity59 connection : @entity44 , once of @entity49 , came on for @entity32 in the win over @entity11 @entity11 should have known what would happen next			1
a collision with @entity32 at a major tournament inevitably spells doom and this was the fourth time in eight years they have lost to this particular foe , a run which started when they were beaten in the third place play - off at the @entity71 in 2006			1
@entity11 ’s last major win over @entity32 was at the @entity73 in 2000			2
some curious decisions were made during @entity75 ’ short reign as @entity78 manager but none puzzled more than the decision to hand winger @entity81 — who was almost sold a number of times by sir @entity84 — a new five - year contract			1
monday ’s appearance for @entity11 was @entity81 ’s third in two weeks			2
he only played three times for @entity78 after @entity89			0
more disappointment : @entity81 flopped again as @entity11 were thrashed			2

@entity37 and @entity32 bench were *unsporting* when @entity26 was sent off
@entity11 have now lost four times in eight years to @entity32
@entity44 's name should be familiar to @entity49 fans
it 's baffling how @entity81 got a new five - year deal at @entity78
