enemy drones have become a major threat on the battlefield , and the @entity3 hopes a roof mounted laser could be the answer			0
its ground - based @entity8 program , commonly referred to as @entity9 , allowing controllers to simply drive the weapon to a target			0
once drones are spotted , it can them shoot them out of the sky with a high powered laser			0
' we 're confident we can bring together all of these pieces in a package that 's small enough to be carried on light tactical vehicles and powerful enough to counter these threats , ' said @entity29			1
gen. @entity30 , vice chief of naval research and commanding general , the @entity32			0
the @entity9 system is being designed for use on light tactical vehicles such as the @entity36 and @entity37			1
the navy hopes the system will provide an affordable alternative to traditional firepower to keep enemy unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity44 ) from tracking and targeting @entity45 on the ground			1
' we can expect that our adversaries will increasingly use @entity44 and our expeditionary forces must deal with that rising threat , ' said col. @entity51 , acting head of @entity54 's @entity53 and @entity55			0
some of the system 's components already have been used in tests to detect and track @entity44 of all sizes			1
later in the year , researchers will test the entire system against targets using a @entity64 laser as a stepping stone to a @entity67 laser			2
' @entity9 gives the @entity45 a capability to counter the @entity44 threat efficiently , sustainably and organically with austere expeditionary forces			0
' @entity9 employed in a counter uav role is just the beginning of its use and opens myriad other possibilities for future expeditionary forces			0
' some of the system 's components already have been used in tests to detect and track @entity44 of all sizes			2
later in the year , researchers will test the entire system against targets using a @entity64 laser as a stepping stone to a @entity67 laser			2
the @entity85 system is expected to be ready for field testing in 2016 , when the program will begin more complex trials to ensure a seamless process from detection and tracking to firing , all from mobile tactical vehicles			1
spotter vehicles and a control car will allow the system to operate anywhere .			1
