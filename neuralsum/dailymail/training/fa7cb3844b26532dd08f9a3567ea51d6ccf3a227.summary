testosterone - pumped : residents in @entity24 are giving this enormous male elk a wide berth as he searches for female moose wrong way ? every year elk come through the town			1
the cows graze on the lush grass and the males are looking to mate every autumn , elk spend the afternoon and evenings walking the streets of @entity24 in @entity36 , @entity3 , @entity37			1
occasionally , as many as 40 or 50 arrive together , attracting huge crowds who watch on with curiosity , awe and fear			0
wildlife photographer and writer @entity42 , 52 , was there to capture the action last month			0
he said the elk will stay in town for up to several weeks at a time as autumn marks the start of the mating season			1
this enormous bull is one of the first of the season , eager to start the rut do n't mess with him : the elk are territorial and can be aggressive in autumn , so park wardens have to spend most of their time protecting tourists from injury mr @entity42 , from @entity62 , said : ' the cows come to graze on the lush grasses in town			1
' the bulls , such as the one in these photos , follow since autumn is the heart of the annual breeding season , known as " the rut "			2
' the bulls sniff anything and everything they come across , looking for smells that tell them a cow is ready to be bred			0
' the frustration and rising testosterone levels means the male elk are prone to damaging vehicles and property as well as injuring people			2
security threat : police were called to monitor this magnificent bull , to ensure nobody got hurt bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them according to mr @entity42 , some people will photograph them from their cars but this can be incredibly dangerous			0
he said : ' they bulls view everything as a potential threat to their herd dominance and will frequently attack vehicles that stop near them			0
' this is common though as @entity24 is the busiest town in @entity36 and is the headquarters for park operations			1
' because it is so busy with tourists and park employees , evenings in town during the elk rut are quite chaotic			2
' park rangers spend most of their time trying to prevent injury to the visitors and property			0
