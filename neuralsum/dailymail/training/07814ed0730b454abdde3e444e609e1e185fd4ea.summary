could have proven useful for situations like the @entity2 riots in 2011 by @entity3 rumours spread fast , and with social media sites like @entity7 it 's quicker than ever to share your thoughts – and boasts – with the online world			1
but be careful what you tweet ; scientists from the @entity13 are developing an online lie detector that can tell fact from fiction in just 140 characters or less			0
the lie detector , named ' @entity19 ' after a @entity21 goddess famed for spreading scandalous rumour , will sift through tweets from news outlets , individuals , members of the public , and automated ' bots ' to see if their posts are as truthful as they claim			1
a new lie detector is being developed that will sift through user tweets on social networking site @entity7 , to tell truth from lies and identify accounts set up to spread malicious rumours such a system could have been valuable for situations like the 2011 @entity2 riots , where rioters used networks like @entity7 to organise themselves and spread untrue information			1
' there was a suggestion after the 2011 riots that social networks should have been shut down , to prevent the rioters using them to organise , ' says scientist @entity49 of the @entity13 , who is leading the development of the system			2
' but social networks also provide useful information – the problem is that it all happens so fast and we ca n’t quickly sort truth from lies			0
' this makes it difficult to respond to rumours , for example , for the emergency services to quash a lie in order to keep a situation calm			0
' our system aims to help with that , by tracking and verifying information in real time			1
' @entity19 will use a range of different indicators to tell the difference between truthful tweets , malicious rumours , and harmless boasts			2
the system will assess the authority of the @entity7 user , assigning more trust to well - known , reliable outlets like experts or news accounts			0
it will trawl through the history and background of users to pinpoint accounts that were created purely to spread lies and rumours			0
@entity19 will hunt for other accounts that confirm or deny the information , and keep a close eye on how the conversation is developing - plotting all the results in a visual dashboard to easily spot popular rumours that are taking hold			2
a system like @entity19 would have been very valuable during the @entity2 riots in 2011			1
a scene from the riots in @entity102 from august 2011 is pictured , as @entity104 riot police walk past a burning building in @entity102 @entity19 will classify online rumours into four different types : speculation – for example , over rising interest rates ; controversy – such as the furore over the @entity114 vaccine ; misinformation – where a lie is spread unknowingly ; and disinformation – where the information is spread with malicious intent			1
although the lie detector is not currently up and running , @entity49 hopes to have a final version within 18 months , with working prototypes completed sooner .			0

system will sift through tweets in real time to verify or *debunk* lies
