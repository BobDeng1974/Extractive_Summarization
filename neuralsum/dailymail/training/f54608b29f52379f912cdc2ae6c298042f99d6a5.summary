after years of quietly conceding defeat in our battle for wardrobe space , my husband @entity4 has finally snapped			1
perhaps he ’d overheard me grumble ‘ i do n’t have anything to wear ! ’ one too many times			2
or he had stumbled across the summer dresses i ’ve hung on his clothes rail to make way for my winter purchases			1
determined to prove i have far more clothes than i need ( or have time to wear ) , he decided to compile an inventory			1
he ’d taken on quite a task because my clothes have spread from my wardrobe and drawers into every inch of storage space , from the cloakroom to the attic			1
when i returned home , i was stunned to discover a long line of near identical winter boots in the hallway			2
on the bed were piles of identical t - shirts , a mountain of long - sleeved tops and jeans , at least 20 black dresses and two dozen jackets			1
in the spare room was a forgotten rail of party gowns — all worn just once or twice			2
i stood there in silence , taking it all in			2
there were no other words for it : i ’d been wardrobe shamed			1
not only had @entity4 made it glaringly obvious i have far too much of everything , he had cast a spotlight on something even more absurd : i buy the same thing over and over again			1
i have 32 white tops			2
every year , i buy new ones without a thought for those i already own			2
yes , there are subtle differences in cut and sleeve style , but seeing them en masse i could understand @entity4 ’s complaint : ‘ is n’t a white top a white top ? ’ @entity78 ( pictured ) says @entity4 made it glaringly obvious she has too much of everything @entity4 has just one suit , four pairs of jeans , three jumpers and a handful of shirts			1
so , why do i — and so many other women — have so many clothes ? just last month , @entity89 revealed her wardrobe , filled with hundreds of pairs of jeans			1
@entity93 is testament to the fact women are for ever searching for their next ‘ look ’			2
‘ men and women have been socially conditioned to value clothes differently , ’ says psychologist @entity97 , of @entity99 consultants			1
men buy a new jumper to replace an old one but for women , clothes are more an emotional investment than necessity			1
each purchase is tied up with self - esteem , body image and a desire to fit in or stand out			2
after @entity4 sorted her clothes , @entity78 ( pictured ) started to wonder how she had managed to buy similar items over and over again each year we keep buying new things , says @entity97 , because we feel under pressure to constantly prove our allure			1
we may be subconsciously seeking approval from friends or have reached a crossroads in our lives and want to reflect that by changing our image			2
‘ women are more likely to hold on to things with positive associations or which represent a life goal , such as a dress that does n’t fit , but hopefully will one day			2
’ seeing my wardrobe laid out before me was as much a trip down memory lane as a wake - up call			1
there was the floral maxi dress from our honeymoon in 1999 , and the linen blazer and matching dress i wore on my first day at work			2
though i have friends who shop as often as me , they clear out their wardrobes regularly			0
they ’d never hold on to a moth - holed top because it reminds them of a holiday			0
seeing her wardrobe laid out in front of her was like a trip down memory lane for @entity78 i also need to stop buying clothes that do n’t suit me			1
of all the clothes @entity4 discovered , i wear only a few regularly			1
women often mistakenly believe that the more clothes , shoes and accessories they have , the better dressed they ’ll be , but the opposite is often true , ’ says @entity160 , author of new book @entity162 : @entity163 ( recoveringshopaholic.com )			1
‘ having a large wardrobe produces a false sense of security and abundance , but most women wear only 20 to 30 per cent of what they own			1
’ @entity160 suggests we should do a wardrobe audit at least once a year			1
‘ once you organise like with like , you can see where you are duplicating clothing and what , if any , real shopping needs you have , ’ she says			0
‘ try on everything and see if it fits , if you like it and if it works for your lifestyle			0
‘ an item could be in good condition , but may be dated or not suit your needs any more			0
‘ our bodies also change , even if we remain the same weight and dress size			0
’ @entity4 ( left ) says he ca n't understand how someone could want so many similar items in my defence , i have been through a decade of sartorial upheaval due to three pregnancies and a work / life shift that saw me swap full - time office work to be a freelancer and full - time mother			1
now i need to be tough and get rid of the power skirt suits and party dresses i no longer need			0
so , i ’ve started selling dresses i no longer wear on @entity201			0
i ’m also working through the identical white shirts , black trousers , skinny jeans and so on , with the aim of whittling each clothing group down to three			0
my best discovery is the website girlmeetsdress.com , which loans out party frocks for less than £ 40			0
so , on the rare occasions i do go out for the night , i can keep up with fashion trends without clogging up my wardrobe			1
@entity214 says : browsing a magazine last weekend , @entity78 spotted a £ 295 denim dress and announced her intention to buy it			0
i said surely it would be easier — and cheaper — to rummage through her wardrobe , where she ’d find half - a - dozen identical denim dresses she already owns			1
@entity78 ( pictured ) says @entity4 's wardobe consists of just one suit , four pairs of jeans , three jumpers and a handful of shirts but @entity78 told me they were all subtly , yet significantly , different			1
and i should actually be praising her for her frugality ! by stockpiling all her purchases over the past two decades , she explained , she had worn them many times as they went in and out of fashion			0
but take one of her wardrobe staples — the grey woollen top			1
she has amassed so many i have no way of knowing whether she has splashed out on a new one ( as i suspect ) or it really is ‘ just that old thing i ’ve had for years ’			0
i ca n’t understand why anyone would want so many similar items			1
unlike my cricket jockstrap or skiing long johns , it ’s not as if each performs a separate , essential function — they are so alike as to be indistinguishable			0
and so i took matters into my own hands and played a game of fashion snap , piling up matching garments and shoes while @entity78 was out			0
@entity78 has started selling the clothes she no longer wears on @entity201 and is using the website @entity261 to rent dresses for a night instead of splashing out on a new outfit it confirmed she owns far too many clothes that are very similar in style , colour and cut			1
but is that really surprising ? we all have particular styles in which we think we look good			0
every time i buy a winter jacket , i return thinking i am at the cutting edge of male fashion			0
but then @entity78 asks why it is identical to every jacket i ’ve bought since 1992			0
but while that may be the case , for every jacket i buy , she buys five			0
and until now , she never throws anything out			0
i am not convinced her new efforts to streamline her wardrobe will come to much			2
she put a pair of unworn ankle boots for sale on @entity201			0
just a day later , the listing had disappeared			0
she explained that seeing the boots on the site made her realise how nice they were			0
they would n’t fetch more than £ 10 , so by not selling them , she would not have to buy another pair			0
in other words , she was saving us money			0
it ’s logic , @entity299 , but not as any man would know it			0

@entity16 's husband , @entity4 , decided to take on her wardrobe
@entity4 was determined to prove his wife has too many clothes
he sorted all the similar items into piles , with *shocking* *results* !
