with the return of the @entity3 this weekend , fans around the country got a chance to see their new signings in action for the first time			1
whether they were playing their first game in @entity11 football or returning to their former club to play for a new side , the debutants carried a weight of expectation into the opening day of the season			2
from first goals to early injuries , @entity19 's reporters pass their judgement on the new signings			1
@entity24 by @entity25 @entity27 - @entity26 was slow to get forward down the right for the @entity29			1
needs time to show what he can do in an @entity24 shirt to minimise the damage from @entity36 ’s move away			1
does n’t look overawed whatsoever			2
@entity41 - a case of trying too hard , @entity41 looked bright but very little came off and the @entity52 needs to play centrally			1
excellent clipped delivery for @entity55 ’s equaliser			1
@entity56 by @entity57 @entity58 – played better than anything he showed during his loan spell at @entity62 last season			2
@entity64 – he always looks ungainly but the @entity66 defender did stop a goal by clearing up after @entity69 ’s spill from @entity70			2
@entity71 – the pick of the @entity56 debutants			2
thrived in a central role and set up an easy chance for @entity76 that was fluffed			2
impressive : @entity77 looked assured at left back , which will calm the nerves of @entity56 fans who saw him last year excellent : @entity71 put in an impressive display on debut for @entity56 , running hard and creating chances @entity85 by @entity25 @entity86 - did n’t have a man to mark directly but kept his concentration and marauded down the right with purpose			1
@entity92 - @entity91 glanced header put @entity85 ahead , but he was then guilty of losing @entity55 for the equaliser			1
rising high : @entity92 escapes @entity55 to head in @entity85 's goal but he lost the same man for the equaliser @entity49 - found himself isolated on occasion , but did well to hold the ball up in tricky circumstances and it was important that the visitors had a focal point			1
@entity103 by @entity104 drifter : @entity106 showed flashes of his undoubted talent but will need to get into games more @entity110 - looks a shrewd acquisition by @entity112			1
patrolled the left side with boundless energy			0
@entity115 - fitted comfortably into midfield for @entity103 before a knee injury forced him off in the 40th minute			1
@entity106 - drifted in and out of the game			0
a lot more to come from the talented youngster			0
@entity121 by @entity122 @entity123 paid a club £ 8m for the @entity126 striker and he notched a debut @entity3 goal to start repaying it			1
@entity130 : @entity131 scored 22 minutes into his @entity121 career as he looks to pay back their significant investment @entity62 by @entity135 @entity136 - some fine cross field passing , a few thumping challenges but also some less refined moments of play			2
@entity142 - could have found things difficult after he was booked early on but the right - back defended well and showed enough good moments going forward for a satisfying debut			2
@entity147 - came on as a late substitute and his presence appeared to unsettle @entity151 ’s defence , leading to @entity62 ’s winning goal			0
assured : @entity62 manager @entity141 described @entity136 's as excellent following sunday 's win presence : @entity147 came on from the bench and unsettled the @entity151 backline at @entity157 video new signings excellent - @entity159 @entity160 by @entity161 @entity162 - no better , no worse than his more experienced colleagues but in truth the @entity160 defence looked as vulnerable as ever and a centre half must be their top priority in the transfer market			1
@entity170 - desperately disappointing : a bruising encounter with @entity172 ended his debut after just 24 minutes			1
not out of place : @entity162 looked no worse than his fellow defenders but @entity160 were shaky at the back a cut above : despite a lack of movement around him @entity178 made a good impression on his @entity160 debut @entity178 - passes the ball beautifully and looks an improvement to @entity160 ’s midfield			1
the problem was there was so little dynamism about his team - mates , so it was hard to judge just how effective he might be long term			0
@entity193 by @entity104 @entity195 - @entity194 debut from the centre back			2
no reason why he ca n’t break back into the @entity200 fold			0
@entity201 - deployed as a sweeper in @entity193 ’s new - look 3 - 5 - 2 system , but marking let him down for @entity103 opener			1
sweeping up : @entity201 had a pivotal role in @entity208 's defensive system , but it did not go to plan at fault : @entity201 allows @entity103 's @entity211 to escape him and head in the game 's only goal @entity214 - showed brilliant energy in the @entity193 midfield			1
looks to be an excellent signing by @entity208			0
@entity151 by @entity135 @entity218 - beaten twice but could do nothing about either goal			0
@entity221 had a shot to save			0
when he had to handle , he did so with confidence			0
@entity224 - got up and down the left flank with great frequency , he and @entity151 will benefit from him playing regular games			0
head over heels : @entity218 gave a confident display in the @entity151 goal against @entity62 @entity232 - found everything happening a bit too quickly and never had enjoy from @entity136 and @entity234			0
@entity236 - a threat from early on , passed the ball well and created chances most notably when his sweet back heel sent @entity241 through for the equaliser			2
@entity243 - could have been a hero on his debut but somehow managed to head wide when the goal was at his mercy following @entity248 ’s shot			2
horror miss : @entity250 striker @entity243 holds his head in his hands after heading wide from close range @entity254 by @entity57 @entity70 – @entity256 , as you ’d expect the @entity258 full - back to be			0
had one shot parried by @entity69			0
@entity260 – pleasing on the eye with his quick feet but not enough end product			0
@entity263 – ran hard and fast but did n’t get in the penalty area often enough for a centre forward			0
robust : @entity70 made , as expected , a solid start to life at @entity254 , and should suit them potential : @entity269 striker @entity260 has bags of potential but needs to find a bit more cutting edge @entity274 by @entity275 @entity276 – combative and energetic , the @entity277 left back slotted straight in to the @entity274 backline and laid on @entity280 's late equaliser			1
he looks an assured addition			0
@entity283 – he 's only played seven @entity3 games in two years and @entity285 and it showed			1
he was off the pace and subdued and it came as no surprise when he was replaced in the second half			0
off the pace : @entity283 needs regular game time if he is to recapture the form that led @entity285 to sign him @entity293 by @entity161 @entity294 - looked solid enough			1
no sign of the ‘ flappy hands ’ that earned him his @entity24 nickname			1
made some good saves and seems like a decent addition			0
@entity301 - only had 25 minutes but provided the key cross which led to @entity293 ’s second goal			1
as such , the @entity305 appears to be unfazed by the initial transition to the @entity3			1
impact : @entity311 , on his return to the @entity293 team , smashed home the winner at @entity314 bright start : despite only being on the pitch for a short while @entity315 showed encouraging signs @entity315 - only had 13 minutes , but holds the ball up really well and almost combined with @entity311 to create a third , only @entity321 crunching challenge saving the day for @entity160			1
@entity311 - not a debut as such , but a return to @entity293			1
and he has been missed			0
given free rein behind the striker , @entity311 is a good player and on saturday he excelled in the space he was granted			0
@entity39 by @entity327 @entity328 a way to endear yourself to @entity39 fans , with a coolly taken last - minute winner at @entity333			0
@entity38 started at centre half and switch to right back after @entity39 were reduced to 10 men after 30 minutes			2
he looked composed in both positons			0
dream debut : @entity38 rounds @entity339 to score the stoppage time winner for @entity39 at @entity341 love at first sight : the goal , along with @entity38 's solid defense display , will have pleased the @entity39 fans @entity345 by @entity275 @entity346 – suspect in possession on occasions but athletic nonetheless and kept @entity350 quiet			1
@entity351 – came close to a debut goal against his former club and was typically busy and involved throughout			2
he provided the cross for his side 's second goal and could prove a shrewd acquisition			2
@entity360 – he 's got a thunderous left boot and that showed on the occasions he did take aim at @entity274 's goal			2
he looks ready - made for the @entity3			1
@entity333 by @entity327 @entity367 at left back and not intimidated on his @entity3 debut after a summer move from @entity370			1
defended well early on and made good decisions on when and where to join the attack			0
could not stop @entity38 scoring the late winner			0
promising start : @entity376 defended well after making the step up from the championship @entity380 - @entity379 midfielder from @entity383 football			0
athletic , strong and full of running			0
diving header fizzed wide in the first half			0
less influential after the break			0

@entity41 makes his first appearance in the @entity3 after joining @entity24 from @entity389
@entity115 forced off with knee injury on @entity103 debut
@entity178 impresses but @entity160 lose to @entity293
@entity92 scores on his @entity85 bow but at fault for @entity24 's equaliser minutes later
