@entity8 and two of her sisters were their father 's secret weapon in the campaign , tweeting candid thoughts about the candidate , which made him more relatable			2
however , @entity1 's popularity never went over 5 per cent and he lost the @entity9 nomination to @entity62			1
@entity8 is currently a co-host on @entity64 show @entity65 , where she offers a more @entity9 perspective on the liberal network show			1
