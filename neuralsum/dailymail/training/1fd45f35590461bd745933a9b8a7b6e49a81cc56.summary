@entity0 was caught sleeping on duty at an old folks care home and will serve an 18 month jail sentence a care worker caught sleeping while on duty at an old folk ’s home may face deportation after serving an 18 month jail sentence			1
@entity11 - born @entity12 disabled alarm systems and doubled up incontinence pads for elderly care home residents so she could sleep on her night shift			1
the 42 - year - old was caught sound asleep in front of the television in the middle of the night by two of her bosses who had become suspicious			1
after being convicted on all 19 counts of neglect of an elderly or infirm person - one for each resident of the home - it emerged she had already admitted identity fraud for using someone else ’s passport			1
judge @entity34 said : ' having cheated her way into employment , she cheated her way through employment			2
' he told @entity0 : ' your conduct was a disgrace			1
it was cruel , it was unacceptable			2
' @entity0 is appealing a @entity46 decision to deny her leave to remain in @entity48 and may now be deported by virtue of the 18 - month prison sentence she received			1
through a first trial and then a retrial , the defendant maintained that she had not been asleep in the way her bosses - the home ’s manager @entity57 and team leader @entity59 - had maintained			1
the care worker claimed she had just been ' resting her eyes ' , despite the managers taking turns to watch her for some time while the other checked on residents			2
but the judge said that events in the early morning of august 18 , 2011 , were not a one - off but showed the ' modus operandi ' which @entity0 had used on a number of occasions			1
other staff members from @entity71 care home in @entity73 , near @entity74 , told how shift - worker @entity0 put two pads on residents on another occasion to reduce the need to change them			1
she told a colleague it was what she had done in a previous job			0
investigators also found alarmed fall mats beside the beds had been disconnected but made to look intact			0
other measures had been taken to reduce the need to check on or deal with the 19 residents - who were aged between 75 and 100 and suffering from health problems including dementia and incontinence			1
care home bosses contacted the police and also referred themselves to the care industry watchdog			0
relatives of the patients praised the home and its other staff for the outstanding service provided and for the bravery shown in alerting the authorities			0
judge @entity34 presided over @entity0 ’s trial at @entity105 , sitting in @entity106 , @entity107			1
the defendant was working at @entity109 in @entity73 at the time			0
she used someone else 's passport to get a job prosecutor @entity113 then told him of the passport fraud , in which @entity0 had admitted a charge of possessing false identity documents			1
he said : ' the defendant was employed by @entity121 company at @entity122 on april 22 , 2010 , after she had submitted an application in the name of @entity125			0
' she had provided a genuine @entity127 passport in that name and had provided a @entity130 printout in that name , an @entity133 card in that name and an energy bill in that name			1
' the court knows she ’s an illegal immigrant but @entity122 did a criminal records bureau check on that name and that showed no entries			1
' he said after the investigation into her activities at @entity71 had begun , police visited @entity122 , @entity146 , to probe the circumstances of her work there and inform staff that she was not who she had claimed to be			0
@entity153 , defending , said in mitigation that his client had left @entity11 for a better life in the @entity48 in 2001 after years of struggling to cope following the murders of her shopkeeper parents in an armed robbery in the mid 1990s			0
colleagues said that she would double up on the residents ' incontinence pads so that she would not have to change them as often she met a @entity11 man with whom she has had two children - both born in the @entity48 - and with whom she was still living before being jailed			1
he has also applied for indefinite leave to remain in @entity48 and is waiting for a response			0
' it was really through a desire to get work and support the young family that she made the foolish decision to do so with a passport that was not her own , ' said mr @entity153			1
' it was given to her by someone in the community to help her survive			0
' he said the passport with which she entered @entity48 was seized by the border authorities , although he could not say what passport that was			2
of her neglect of the residents , mr @entity153 added : ' this is indicative of laziness and tiredness , rather than a wish to be physically cruel to residents			2
that ’s a very great distinction			2
' it is a case about a failure to act , a failure to provide care which ought to be provided			0
' responding to pleas for leniency for the sake of the children , judge @entity34 told mr @entity153 : “ i do n’t sentence the children			0
she does , by her actions			0
' the fact that you have got children does not mean the judge should not do justice to the victims			0
' he told @entity0 : ' you were their protector on that night shift and you were nothing like their protector			1
your criminality was consistent and sustained neglect			2
' the sentence is one of imprisonment			0
it must be , to deter others who want to cheat their employers and cheat on residents to ensure a quiet night			2
' the elderly must have protection and the court must make it clear			0
if you are charged to look after them and you do n’t you will face imprisonment			2
' he sentenced her to 19 concurrent sentences of 13 months in jail , to be served consecutively with a five - month term for the passport offence			1
the judge said he believed @entity0 should be barred from ever working with the elderly in a care home or hospital again			1
@entity244 , general manager of @entity245 , which owns @entity71 , said afterwards : ' it has been a pretty horrible situation that has gone on for quite a long time and for the residents and families to have gone through that , so we are satisfied to have got the conclusion we wanted			0
' we are angry that somebody would do this to our residents			0
people who work in care do so because they are supposedly caring people			0
' @entity260 , whose 91 - year - old mother @entity261 was one of the 19 residents , said : ' it has been very difficult and you ’re almost relieved that they ( the residents ) could not remember what was going on			2
' she praised what she described as ' a very , very good , caring home ' for taking a huge risk in raising the issue , possibly jeopardising its reputation			0
' i ’m just glad that @entity0 got what she deserved and i do n’t want to see her anywhere near any vulnerable people ever again , ' she added .			1
