sleeping soundly beneath eye masks and blankets , @entity0 make the 270 - mile train journey from @entity4 to @entity5 in a farcical monthly move between the @entity8 ’s two headquarters			1
nicknamed the gravy train or the @entity11 , two privately - chartered trains shuttle 1,000 parliament staff from its main seat in @entity15 to its ‘ official ’ home in @entity17 for just four days a month			1
an estimated 360,000 man hours are lost every year when 3,000 staff and 766 meps relocate en masse to @entity17 by car , train and plane			1
getting some shut - eye : a total of 766 meps travel to @entity17 for just two full working days every single month the wasted hours are no more apparent than on board one of the two plush trains , which are exclusively chartered for parliamentary staff for half a million pounds a year			1
after the four - hour train journey , most of the highly - paid @entity0 will not arrive at parliament until almost 3pm , when they will finally begin working			2
just 72 hours later , they board a train home – having worked just two full days in @entity5 – while their documents and a fleet of cars are returned to @entity15			2
this second home costs taxpayers an estimated £ 150million annually , despite being deserted for 85 per cent of the year			2
time to chat : two @entity0 share a beer as they travel , while another takes advantage of the downtime during ‘ @entity17 week ’ , 2,500 trunks of documents are moved across the border in lorries at a cost of £ 250,000 , and a fleet of black @entity52 are taken on transporters so they are waiting for meps when they arrive			1
staff are put up in expensive hotels , which double in price when parliament is sitting , and receive generous expenses during their visit			0
the high - speed private train service , which boasts luxurious red velvet seats , was introduced in 2008 by president @entity64			2
senior officials who do not take the ‘ train special ’ , as it is called , are able to use a privately - chartered jet which runs twice a week or a chauffeur - driven @entity52			1
paper trail : eurocrats take 2,500 trunks of documents , taken over the border in lorries at a cost of £ 250,000 @entity55 voted three to one in favour of having just one parliament building in october last year			1
but the vote was fruitless because the @entity17 agreement is written into the 1992 @entity80			1
the governments for all of the 28 member countries must agree to any change in the treaty			0
@entity5 has made it clear that it would veto any such amendment – as @entity17 rakes in an estimated £ 17million a year for the @entity5 economy			0
@entity88 , @entity89 for the @entity90 , said : ‘ anyone can see that it is completely mad to have two headquarters instead of one at a cost of tens of millions of pounds a year			0
‘ but we will never be able to change it because it is written in the treaty and @entity5 will veto it every time			0
it stands as a metaphor for the whole @entity104 project which is full of things nobody can explain , that nobody can justify but , ultimately , that nobody can change			0
’ in session in @entity17 : @entity55 voted three to one in favour of having just one parliament building in october last year			1
but the vote was fruitless because the @entity17 agreement is written into the @entity80 @entity112 , @entity113 mep for the @entity114 , said : ‘ hours and hours of people ’s lives are going down the plughole each month travelling there			1
‘ it is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the @entity121			0
it duplicates an existing parliament , it achieves precisely nothing and it wastes money			0
‘ it is ridiculous that we only sit here for 48 days a year and yet there are 100 members of staff who are working full - time as cleaners , in security and in catering awaiting our return			2
‘ the lights are left on , the building is heated , the floors are cleaned – all for no one			0
’ but @entity5 mep @entity140 said : ‘ it is true that the majority of meps are opposed to this , but it is not them who get to decide , it is the governments			0
’ plus , he added with a smile , ‘ i live in @entity148 so it is very convenient for me ’ .			0

some 360,000 man hours are lost each year by the monthly relocation
senior officials may also travel by private jet or chauffeur - driven @entity52
@entity55 last year voted three to one in favour of *ditching* one parliament
but the costly arrangement is set in stone by 1992 *'s* @entity80
