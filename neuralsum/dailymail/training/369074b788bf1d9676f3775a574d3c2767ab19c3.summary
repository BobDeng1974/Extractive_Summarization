millions of @entity1 customers will receive a 5 per cent price cut , worth £ 37 a year , as energy giants finally start to pass on falling wholesale costs			1
the news will come as a fresh blow to @entity7 , who until recently advocated a 20 - month price freeze			0
last night industry experts warned that the @entity11 policy had made firms delay price reductions for fear of being locked into bad deals			0
new deal : @entity1 announced today it will reduce household gas prices by five per cent , cutting annual energy bills on average by £ 37 the gas price cut for some 6.8million homes on the @entity23 variable rate tariff will start on february 28			1
it follows @entity26 ’s 4 per cent reduction last week			1
however , @entity1 electricity prices will not change , and the saving is still tiny in the context of dramatic falls in wholesale energy prices over the past year			1
the cost of gas has dropped 28 per cent , and that of electricity 15 per cent			0
analysts say if firms passed on the full benefit to consumers , the average bill would be £ 140 a year cheaper			0
as recently as 2007 , providers reduced bills by 17 per cent , dwarfing the current cuts			0
the fall in wholesale costs has forced @entity11 to re-brand its price freeze as a ‘ cap ’ , with mr @entity7 now saying he would give industry regulator @entity48 the power to force a reduction in tariffs if he won a general election			1
but @entity1 yesterday warned that a @entity11 government bent on price controls would pose a ‘ risk ’ to the firm			2
asked if the prospect was a factor in its price - setting , @entity61 gas finance director @entity60 said : ‘ we ’re conscious of it as well as all of the other risks that we face in the market			1
’ @entity66 , of consumer finance website @entity67 , said the threat of a price freeze had led energy firms to limit cuts			1
falling : wholesale gas prices have tumbled since the end of 2013 - but the costs have not been passed on			1
units are measure in pence per therm - equal to about 96.7 cubic feet of natural gas soaring : fuel prices have been rising sharply in recent years , as this @entity81 graph shows he said : ‘ we are seeing smaller cuts than we would have done otherwise			2
‘ @entity87 idea , but by pre-announcing it , they have ruined it			0
by going for electoral gain , by saying “ we are doing this are n’t we wonderful , we ’re going to freeze your prices ” , what they have done is self - defeated their own policy			0
’ @entity98 seized on the @entity1 announcement , telling @entity100 : ‘ we should be absolutely clear that this price cut would not be happening if we ’d listened to @entity11 and put in place their 20 - month price freeze			2
’ but experts said a 5 per cent cut was too little , too late			2
@entity48 is so concerned about the failure to pass savings on to customers that it has referred the energy industry to a full inquiry by the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) , which could take a year to complete			2
@entity113 , of citizens advice , said : ‘ the savings being offered remain disappointingly low , but if @entity26 and @entity1 can cut prices other firms must now do the same			1
energy bills have risen by a third since 2010 , yet wholesale costs are at a four - year low			0
’ mr @entity7 defended @entity11 ’s revamped ‘ price cap ’ , saying : ‘ a 5 per cent fall			2
is not nearly good enough			0
if the @entity121 want a competition about who can properly stand up to energy companies , i say bring it on			1
’ @entity127 , the head of @entity1 ’s parent company @entity1 , claimed it made cuts as early as possible in a ‘ volatile ’ market			0
@entity1 said the cut was worth £ 37 a year on average			0

@entity61 *'s* biggest energy supplier says change will come in on february 27
the 5 ***%*** gas cut is far lower than the *25* ***%*** fall in wholesale gas prices
@entity26 last week announced that it would be cutting its gas price by 3 ***%***
remaining four in the @entity144 energy companies may also announce cuts
government welcomes cut but says customers still better off switching
