@entity5 , 30 , is going to be living in a human - sized rabbit hutch for 48 hours money raised from sponsorship of the event will go to the @entity21 and the @entity23 rabbit rescues			1
speaking to @entity24 about her decision to go through with the task , she said : ' i have been hoping to do something for both these local charities for a while			0
' while i was brainstorming , i came up with the idea of being that rabbit that we see in practice and in rescues that is treated as we used to believe was ok			2
' the rabbits that live in a small hutch with no space or stimulation , with a poor diet which often leads to dental problems , no company of fellow rabbits , generally just a bit of a miserable existence			2
' @entity5 in her ' rabbit hutch ' @entity5 believes that the problem lies in the fact that people do n't understand how to care for rabbits properly			1
emma with one of her pet rabbits she said : ' i was hoping that doing it this way is just silly enough to grab a bit of attention and make a few people think if there were some little changes they could make to improve life for their pet just a little			0
' rabbits are such misunderstood pets - they are still often seen as a child first pet , but they are really not suitable for this , they are nervous creatures that can , if handled improperly , even fracture their own spine			0
' they need space , time , another bonded rabbit for company , vaccinations and , when ill , can go downhill very quickly			0
' rabbits are the third most popular pet in the @entity78 , yet the most neglected - which is not simply due to cruelty , it is often a misunderstanding of their needs and they are really beloved pets			0
' if this can make a couple of people think it is worth it to me			0
