@entity2 migrants should not move to @entity3 unless they have a job lined up , @entity0 suggested			1
the chancellor insisted that @entity7 freedom of movement rules were not created to allow people to live off the welfare state in other countries			1
but in an escalation of tensions between @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity12 chancellor @entity11 today made clear that the general principle of freedom of movement in the @entity7 is ' not negotiable '			1
chancellor @entity0 today insisted that @entity7 freedom of information rules did not envisage ' people coming who do n't have job offers ' or moving into a life on benefits mr @entity0 today visited the @entity27 in @entity28 , where he became one of the first customers on the new tram to @entity32 @entity33 is under increasing pressure to tackle @entity7 immigration , which has fuelled a rise in the number of people moving to @entity3			1
a number of ideas floated by senior @entity41 in recent weeks have been dismissed as illegal or unworkable			0
@entity42 today admitted that the prime minister still does not know how to curb immigration , telling journalists : ' no final decisions have been taken			1
' instead of imposing quotas or caps on the number of people who could move to @entity3 , the pm is being urged to focus on limiting access to the benefits system for the unemployed			1
however , @entity52 insiders insist he is determined to tackle the ' huge numbers of people ' who move to the @entity3 for work			2
one proposal would see @entity2 migrants banned from the @entity3 unless they have guaranteed work – and would get kicked out after three months if they could not support themselves			1
mr @entity0 insisted that @entity12 understands ' the disquiet that is caused amongst @entity3 people '			1
he told @entity61 : ' you have people coming from other parts of @entity2 here to claim our benefits , who do n't necessarily have jobs to go to			1
' this is creating a huge pressure on public services and the @entity3 public want this addressed			2
' he added : ' we 're going to do this in a calm and rational way , but the @entity3 people want this addressed ; we 're employed by the @entity3 people and that 's what we 're going to do			2
' what we 're going to address is this question of how freedom of movement operates in the 21st century			2
' it was never envisaged that you would have such large numbers of people coming , people coming who do n't have job offers , people who move onto our benefit system – although we 've been able to tighten that up in recent months , but it 's still the case that they can do that			2
' and that causes a lot of public unhappiness because they think it 's unfair			0
of course , these are welfare payments paid for by hard - working @entity3 taxpayers			0
' @entity33 is being forced to change his planned reform of immigration rules to win @entity11 's support what @entity16 says about freedom of movement @entity12 government source : ' mrs @entity11 feels she has done all she can to placate the @entity3 , but will not accept immigration curbs from @entity7 member states under any circumstances			1
it has come to a @entity117 stand - off and it is now a question of who blinks first			0
' @entity11 's spokesman : ' the general principle of freedom of movement in the @entity7 is not negotiable			1
' what @entity15 says chancellor @entity0 : ' you have people coming from other parts of @entity2 here to claim our benefits , who do n't necessarily have jobs to go to			1
this is creating a huge pressure on public services and the @entity3 public want this addressed			0
' @entity42 source : ' we are talking about numbers			0
overall numbers are too high			0
' work and pensions secretary @entity142 : ' all i know is that the work that we have done is to get rid of the pull factor ; the prime minister ’s always made clear that there are limits in all of this , but i would n’t get engaged in a debate about principles			0
i always think to myself when people start debating principles , what actually happens is they lose the reality of what is happening on the ground			0
' a @entity42 source insisted in addition to tackling abuse of the benefits system , mr @entity33 had made clear he wants to limit the overall number of migrants to @entity3			1
' we are talking about numbers			0
overall numbers are too high			0
we have significantly cut migration from outside the @entity7 , ' the source told @entity169			2
' we are now in a position where the @entity3 economy is performing much more strongly ... and huge numbers of people are coming here from those @entity2 countries to work in the @entity3 and that is now an issue			1
' however @entity12 chancellor @entity11 has fired a warning shot at the prime minister , suggesting she would rather see @entity3 leave the @entity7 than allow the prime minister to tear up its rules on free movement of labour			1
the chancellor warned the prime minister that he is reaching a ' @entity186 ' by pushing for reform of the bloc 's sacred free movement system			2
the pair clashed at a summit in @entity193 last month , @entity12 magazine @entity190 said			1
citing senior officials , it said mrs @entity11 told mr @entity33 he was nearing a ' @entity186 ' with plans to introduce quotas for the number of @entity7 workers who can come to @entity3			1
she threatened to abandon her efforts to keep @entity3 in the @entity7 unless he backed down			2
one government insider was quoted on @entity202 saying : ' the time for talking is close to over			0
' mrs @entity11 feels she has done all she can to placate the @entity3 , but will not accept immigration curbs from @entity7 member states under any circumstances			1
it has come to a @entity117 stand - off and it is now a question of who blinks first			0
' today mrs @entity11 's official spokesman , @entity212 , insisted that @entity12 wants @entity3 to remain an ' active and engaged ' member			1
but he stressed that mrs @entity11 has also made it very clear that ' the general principle of freedom of movement in the @entity7 is not negotiable '			1
national insurance numbers ( @entity218 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity7 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed @entity0 is to seek a deal on cutting @entity3 's shock £ 1.7billion @entity7 bill at a meeting of finance ministers in @entity193 this week			1
the chancellor will lobby other member states to look again at the rules which hammered the @entity3 , while giving rebates to the likes of @entity231 and @entity12			1
@entity42 said the government was still examining the detail of the rules used by @entity7 officials to calculate the astonishing demand , linked to better than expected economy growth			2
@entity33 's official spokesman said : ' what 's clear is that there are a number of issues at play here			0
' there is still more work to do to understand the forecasts , how these compare to other countries			0
' any new deal on @entity7 migration will have to be agreed by 28 member states			0
mr @entity33 's officials spokesman said : ' the point we are making is when the founding fathers established the @entity7 and introduced the principle of free movement it was about labour and how countries integrated in the single market			2
' the mass migration that we have seen with new countries joining , the impact on other populations in countries like the @entity3 , free movement in order to claim benefits , these are all ways that have developed and evolved			2
' senior @entity41 want the government to limit access to tax credits for new arrivals to the @entity3			1
@entity274 , the leader of the conservatives in the @entity2 parliament , said claiming benefits should be linked to contributions to the welfare system			2
he told @entity280 : ' one of the problems we face is that we have a universal benefits system , whereas other countries have the contributory benefit system			0
' he suggested that all benefits , including tax credits , would only be available to someone who had paid tax			1
it would cover everyone , so it does not discriminate against @entity7 migrants			0
mr @entity274 added : ' anyone who wants to get benefits would have to pay in for two years			0
' i 'd like us to say if we win the next election that benefits from the end of 2017 have to be contributory			0
that gives people now in the system time to contribute			0
' it is the latest idea to emerge in the @entity305 search for a policy which will satisfy demands for tougher controls , woo @entity310 voters and be agreed by all 28 @entity7 member states			2
an earlier proposal to impose quotas on access to @entity316 numbers , needed to work in the @entity3 , was dismissed as ' illegal ' by outgoing @entity318 president @entity317			0
another option was to apply an ' emergency brake ' to the numbers which could come from a particular country if , for example , their economic collapse led to large numbers flocking to the @entity3 in search for work			0
mr @entity33 has promised to put immigration at the heart of his plan to renegotiate @entity3 's membership of the @entity7 , before holding at in - out referendum by 2017			1
however , his speech setting out his plans will now be delayed until after the @entity335 and @entity336 by - election , which @entity310 is on course to win after the defection of @entity305 mp @entity340			0
in 2011 , mr @entity33 promised to bring borders and immigration under control : ' no ifs			0
