the view that @entity2 ’s chance at defending their @entity4 title has been ruined through bad spending gathered pace after they were defeated by a club whose entire team cost less than half one of their substitutes			1
@entity13 ’s @entity12 on monday night may only have been worth a mere £ 17m , but left back @entity14 still made it through a @entity2 defence deemed good enough to keep £ 40m signing @entity17 on the bench to tee up a chance for @entity20 just 60 seconds into the game			1
@entity17 joined from @entity22 in august last year and is contracted to @entity2 until june 2019			2
@entity17 ( green bib ) prepares to come on but he never made it off the @entity2 bench however , striker @entity26 succeeded in putting another dent in @entity2 ’s chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away , when he scored @entity13 ’s first goal			1
@entity26 cost @entity13 nothing when joined from arch rivals @entity34 in 2011			0
@entity35 , signed for a comparative pittance of £ 1.9m , delivered @entity2 their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free - kick			0
@entity26 ( left ) cost @entity13 nothing four years ago yet found a way past the @entity2 defence another expensive @entity2 player , £ 24m - man @entity42 , got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left , but they could n’t penetrate @entity13 ’s defence to find an equaliser and a 2 - 1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top			1
@entity42 joined from @entity50 in july 2010 and is contracted to @entity2 until 2017			0
after spending a total of £ 500m pounds on transfer fees , @entity2 might have expected to be higher than a precarious fourth in the league , but judging by their latest results , it ’s teams like @entity13 that seem to be getting their value for money			2
@entity17 has endured a miserable first season at the @entity59 since his £ 40million move			0

@entity2 beaten 2 - 1 by @entity13 on @entity62
£ 40m signing @entity17 was left on the bench
@entity13 *'s* entire starting @entity12 cost just £ *17million*
