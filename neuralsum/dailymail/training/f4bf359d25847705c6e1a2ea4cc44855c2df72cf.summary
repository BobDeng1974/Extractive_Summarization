by @entity1 reporter published : 19:17 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 19:17 est , 16 january 2014 around 63 million £ 50 banknotes showing the first governor of the @entity5 , sir @entity6 , are to be withdrawn from circulation from april 30 , the only legal £ 50 note will be that celebrating the business partnership of entrepreneur @entity10 and engineer @entity11 , who together helped forge the @entity12			1
the withdrawal of the @entity15 note is part of a regular review to combat fraud			1
historic : the note was introduced in 1994 and featured his house on the current site of the @entity5 businesses may choose to no longer accept the note , but it can still be exchanged at the central bank the @entity28 note , introduced in november 2011 , is more secure because it features a new ‘ motion thread ’ – five windows showing the pound symbol and the number 50 , which appear to move up and down when the note is tilted			1
the old - style notes are due to be withdrawn from circulation in 15 weeks			0
in total , about 224 million £ 50 notes worth £ 11.2 billion are in circulation , of which the @entity5 estimates 63 million with a total value of £ 3.2 billion are @entity15 notes			1
from may onwards , retailers are unlikely to accept the @entity6 notes as payment , but most banks and building societies will still allow customers to deposit them into their accounts			0
however , agreeing to exchange the notes after april 30 will be at the discretion of individual institutions			0
@entity51 : sir @entity6 was the founder of the @entity5 and lived in a house on the site in @entity55 , @entity56 , where it now stands @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60 and the @entity61 have agreed to exchange the older - style £ 50 notes for both customers and non-customers up to the value of £ 200 until october 30			1
in a video placed on @entity67 , @entity68 , head of notes division at the @entity5 , advises people : ' if you have any @entity74 £ 50 notes , it 's best to spend , deposit or exchange them before april 30			1
' if people do not pay in or exchange the @entity15 £ 50 notes by the withdrawal deadline , this does not mean that the notes then become worthless			0
composer : a £ 20 note bearing the image of sir @entity84 , pictured , has already been withdrawn all notes that have been issued by the bank whose legal tender status has been withdrawn are covered by its ' promise to pay '			1
this phrase dates back to times when notes could be swapped for gold			0
it means that people can , at any time , obtain the face value of a note that has been withdrawn by exchanging it at the @entity5 in @entity100			2
there is no fee for the service and banknotes of this type can be exchanged by post or in person			0
legally the @entity5 is only required to give one month 's notice of an intention to withdraw legal tender status			1
it gave a similar three - month notice period to its latest announcement when a £ 20 note featuring composer @entity84 was withdrawn in 2010			0
sir @entity6 was appointed as the @entity5 's first governor in 1694 and the £ 50 banknote celebrating him was first issued in 1994 , to coincide with the @entity5 's 300th anniversary			2
the design on the back of the note includes an image of sir @entity6 's house in @entity55 on the site of the @entity5 's present building			2
in december , the @entity5 announced that it plans to issue plastic banknotes for the first time from 2016 , when a new £ 5 note featuring sir @entity128 appears			2
a £ 10 note featuring @entity130 to follow around a year later will also be made from polymer rather than the cotton paper currently used			0
the announcement at the end of last year followed a three - year research programme that concluded plastic notes stay cleaner for longer , are more difficult to counterfeit and are at least 2.5 times longer - lasting			0
old - series notes previously issued by the @entity5 can be exchanged by posting them , at the sender 's risk , to @entity142 , @entity5 , @entity55 , @entity143 .			2
