@entity1 - bound winger @entity0 scored his first @entity3 hat - trick as @entity4 secured their first away win of the season , but they were made to work hard by struggling @entity7 in an error - strewn game at the @entity9			1
@entity0 , who is joining @entity10 at the end of the year , scored three of the @entity13 ' seven tries in a 40 - 22 victory - their first @entity3 success in @entity16 for 18 months - to help his side climb above @entity18 into second place in the table , at least for 24 hours			1
it was a third consecutive win for @entity23 's men and a fifth from their last six matches but their hard - to - please coach will be far from happy with their performance and his mood will have worsened by a hamstring injury to centre @entity30			0
@entity0 ( left ) was in fine form for @entity4 with his first @entity3 hat - trick it was a ninth successive defeat for the @entity33 , who remain rooted to the foot of the table , but a vast improvement on their 80 - 0 rout by @entity39 in their previous league game			1
still without seven senior players through injury , @entity7 gave a debut to @entity45 loanee prop @entity44 , a first start to young loose forward @entity47 and a first @entity3 outing for former @entity49 prop @entity51			2
and their problems worsened when @entity51 sustained a broken thumb and loose forward @entity54 damaged a rib to leave coach @entity56 cursing his luck			0
yet the @entity33 made the best possible start , with makeshift centre @entity59 breaking clear from his own half to create a try for full - back @entity63 , who kicked the first of his three goals			0
@entity4 looked to have gained control , however , when prop @entity68 took @entity70 's pass to crash over for his first try for more than two years and scrum - half @entity72 skipped through @entity33 defence for a solo score			2
flying wingers @entity0 and @entity77 both produced clinical finishes to double the @entity13 ' try tally before half - time but the gritty @entity81 would not lie down as the game opened up after @entity83 ( @entity4 ) and @entity84 ( @entity7 ) were despatched to the sin bin following a skirmish			1
@entity87 got skipper @entity88 through a chink in the visitors ' defence for one try and stand - off @entity93 added another on the stroke of half - time , darting over from dummy half , as @entity7 eyed a repeat of last year 's shock win over @entity23 's men			0
@entity0 scorched over for his second try within two minutes of the re-start following more smart work from his centre partner @entity105 as @entity4 established a 12 - point lead for the third time			1
but @entity93 pounced on a stray pass from former @entity4 's @entity7 forward @entity109 to get winger @entity110 over for a fourth wildcats try to cut the deficit to 30 - 22			2
however , the game always looked to be within @entity4 's grasp and they opened up a three - score lead on 57 minutes when prop @entity116 proved unstoppable from 10 metres out			0
@entity0 was denied when referee @entity117 ruled a knock - on from @entity119 ' grubber kick but he duly completed his hat - trick on 63 minutes after accepting @entity119 ' cut - out pass to cross at the corner .			0

@entity4 secured their first away win of the @entity3 season
@entity0 scored three of the @entity13 ' seven tries
@entity4 climb above @entity18 into second place , at least for 24 hours
