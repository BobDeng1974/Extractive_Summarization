a couple who hanged their pet dog because they did not want to pay £ 100 to have it put down have been spared jail			1

they were told the animal would have to be assessed and the procedure would cost more than £ 100			1

the next day , the three defendants hanged the dog from a loft hatch at @entity14 's home in @entity29			1

she said " do anything , shoot him , just get rid of him " , ' mr @entity35 said			1

the court heard @entity10 was punched in the face during his final moments ' to put him out of his misery ' neither @entity7 nor @entity11 would admit who climbed into the loft to hoist the dog up and both blamed the other			1
but @entity11 did admit to punching @entity10 in the face to ' put it out of its misery ' as the dog struggled for life			1
mr @entity35 told the court : ' i would suggest it is a joint enterprise and it makes little difference who actually went into the loft			1
' a judicial hanging is from a short drop and breaks the neck			0
the x-rays showed no fracture - the dog was pulled slowly up			2
' he added : ' a veterinary report found the dog died as a result of a significant period of pain and distress lasting several minutes			2
@entity10 suffered an unnecessary and painful death as a result			1
' magistrates in @entity23 heard @entity14 told @entity7 and his friend @entity11 to ' do anything , shoot him , just get rid of him ' before the pet dog was killed the dog 's body was buried in @entity14 's garden			1

all three defendants pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to the offence of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal			2
@entity7 and his friend @entity11 both claimed each other carried out the shocking execution , but the court heard the killing was a ' joint enterprise ' @entity11 , of @entity115 , @entity116 , failed to attend court today for sentencing and magistrates issued a warrant for his arrest			1
@entity14 and @entity7 , both of @entity29 , did attend and their solicitors told the court they have suffered ' vilification ' in the local community			1
@entity127 , for @entity14 , said she was the sole carer for her disabled 20 - year - old daughter and her sick mother			0
' she accepts that she knew what was going to happen to the dog , ' mr @entity127 said			2
' had the three defendants not co-operated with the @entity36 it is very unlikely it would be a court case at all			0
' she is in no doubt as to the gravity of the position she finds herself in today			0
she has suffered a degree of vilification in her community has a consequence			0
' @entity143 , for @entity7 , said he suffered from learning difficulties			0
' he is a man who is greatly ashamed , ' she said			0

' @entity150 , chair of the bench , sentenced @entity14 to 18 weeks ' imprisonment and @entity7 to 23 weeks ' custody - both suspended for 18 months			0
she told @entity14 : ' this was a particularly nasty and revolting act			0
' the reasons we have suspended your sentence is that you care for two family members and you have shown remorse for what you have done and you co-operated with the @entity36 in their inquiries			2
' mrs @entity150 told @entity7 : ' it was a particularly nasty thing to do , as i know you are aware of			0
it was a joint enterprise and pre-planned and resulted in the death of a dog			0
' @entity14 was also placed on a tagged curfew , from 9pm to 7am , for six months while @entity7 was given 300 hours of unpaid work			0
the collie dog was killed in the attic of the couple 's home in @entity29 , @entity30 in january both were banned from keeping animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £ 100 towards prosecution costs of £ 2,845 and the £ 80 victim surcharge			1
inspector @entity180 , of the @entity36 , said she was disappointed with the sentences			0
' we were hoping for a lifetime ban on keeping animals but we also respect the court 's decision in explaining the reasoning for the sentences , ' she said			2
' hanging a dog is a horrific thing to do			0
why would you even think it was a suitable way to euthanise an animal ? ' there are other options , such as help from charities or payment plans from vets which could have been discussed the next day			0
' pictures taken by the @entity36 show the litter - strewn garden where the dog was buried after his death			2
