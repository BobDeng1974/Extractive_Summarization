convicted rapists and paedophiles across the @entity2 are being taken on ten - pin bowling and cinema trips in a taxpayer - funded scheme			0
the extraordinary soft - touch initiative means sex offenders who are freed early from prison are then escorted on recreational outings			1
the scheme , known as @entity11 , is already running in @entity12 and is being offered to councils across @entity14 after an initial trial in @entity16			1
as of july last year , there were 96 local programmes , known as ' circles ' - which consist of one offender and four to six volunteers - operating in @entity12 and @entity22			1
the annual average cost per circle is £ 9,800 and on average , this amounts to £ 295,500 across @entity12 and @entity22 ( including the cost of volunteers ) each year			1
volunteers are recruited with the aim of ensuring that sex offenders are not ‘ socially isolated ’ , as this can increase the chances of reoffending			1
the mentors , who are supervised and trained at public expense , provide personal and practical support for the ‘ lonely ’ criminals , helping them to reintegrate into the community			1
the scheme has run in @entity12 since 2002 , and in 2008 , circles @entity2 , a national body supporting the development , quality and effectiveness of the scheme in @entity12 and @entity22 was launched			1
between april 2008 and march 2010 , the @entity64 funded two pilot sites in @entity66 and the @entity67			0
for these two pilots , the total annual cost of the programme ( including the cost of volunteers ) was £ 415,000			2
there are 96 ' circles ' operating in @entity12 and @entity22 which consist of one offender and four to six volunteers but last night @entity14 @entity33 chief whip @entity32 described the move to @entity14 as a ‘ slap in the face for victims ’			1
he said : ‘ perhaps if sex offenders such as these served their full term inside , it would allow the rehabilitation process to have more effect			2
‘ that would negate the need for these schemes which seem to be a soft - touch compensation for automatic early away days for sex offenders release			1
' this is a slap in the face for victims and their families who will not think this is the best use of taxpayers ’ money , and it goes some way to reinforcing the impression the justice system spends more time catering for the needs of criminals than their victims			0
’ they ‘ buy in ’ the service at an average cost of £ 9,000 per offender			1
it is estimated that within five years around 100 sex criminals across @entity14 will be participating in the initiative			2
volunteers are recruited with the aim of ensuring that sex offenders are not ‘ socially isolated ’ @entity28 , @entity29 ’s director of operations for the east of @entity14 , said ‘ social isolation and emotional loneliness ’ have been shown to be ‘ two factors which can increase the risk of reoffending ’			1
he said that in the scheme volunteers from the local community ‘ form a circle ’ around the offender – known as the ‘ core member ’ under its terminology – to provide a support network for the ‘ personal and practical needs of the offender ’			1
part of the volunteers ’ job is to challenge the offender if they show ‘ any signs of minimising their behaviour ’ and to hold them accountable			0
mr @entity28 , on a @entity142 video released in an attempt to reassure the public about the scheme , says : ‘ should circle members have cause for concern , they will report them to the authorities and they will be acted upon quickly and robustly			0
’ he stresses that the circles are not intended to replace statutory supervision of sex offenders by police and social workers			2
one volunteer , known as @entity157 , says on the video that the volunteers are there to ‘ help society in general and try to ensure there are no more victims ’			0
volunteers say the circle meetings can be ‘ very light - hearted ’ – and can even include a ‘ trip down memory lane ’ for the paedophile			0
one of the sex offenders involved in the scheme says he was ‘ lonely ’ and had no friends , but the circle members gave him advice and helped to ‘ keep him safe ’			1
he said the meetings were initially ‘ a bit awkward ’ but the volunteers helped him to ‘ avoid risky situations ’ and to develop greater confidence			0
the idea for the scheme came from a similar project in @entity183			2
a survey by the country 's prison service found it reduced reoffending by 70 per cent			1
the @entity183 social enterprise project involves creating employment for marginalized individuals , including ex-offenders , young people at risk of offending , the homeless , and people with disabilities			0
the ' @entity198 ' is an example of this type of successful social enterprise project			0
since 1995 , @entity198 we can has aimed to provide jobs for the disadvantaged in impoverished area of @entity206 through a recycling scheme			0
more than 700 ' binners ' bring recyclables to the project 's warehouse each day where materials are sorted by 150 employees			0
a source close to the scheme conceded that the recreational trips for sex offenders were an ‘ emotive issue ’ and the paedophiles could be escorted to the local library as well as to cinemas and bowling alleys , depending on their interests			1
the insider said : ‘ the idea is to provide support to them as they go about their normal daily lives			2
’ the sex offenders are expected to pay for their cinema tickets themselves , but the volunteers who accompany them have been trained and must be supervised at taxpayers ’ expense			2
the original idea is from @entity183 , where a survey by the country ’s prison service found it reduced reoffending by 70 per cent			1
@entity240 , @entity29 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ social isolation and emotional loneliness have been shown to be two key factors in increasing the risk of sexual reoffending			0
‘ @entity11 places a “ circle ” of highly - trained volunteers , supported by experienced professional staff , around an offender to monitor and support them with reintegration			2
it is not a replacement for existing public protection arrangements			0
‘ this is about keeping communities safe and making them safer , preventing people being harmed			0
‘ a circle is about working in partnership , assisting an offender to reintegrate into the community with the community as a resource			0
