by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 05:00 est , 18 march 2013 a veteran @entity2 mp has become the first to offer to vacate his seat for @entity4 - opening the way for a leadership battle with @entity7			1
the move by sir @entity9 comes as @entity10 soars again in the polls - reaching 17 per cent , ahead of the @entity12 , while the @entity2 trail nine points behind @entity14			1
according to @entity19 , sir @entity9 , mp for @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity18 , was asked by the prime minister if he would stay on in the @entity21 until the next election			2
growing support : ambitious mayor of london @entity4 , left , is gathering greater popularity as mps such as sir @entity9 , right , look to alternative leaders for the @entity2 mr @entity7 is said to have told him that the party could do without another by - election			1
the 83 - year - old mp replied that he was ‘ keeping his seat warm for @entity4 ’			2
the offer is the clearest of its kind made by a @entity2 mp so far			2
the mp denied he was part of a @entity34 yesterday , but the story will add to the prime minister ’s concerns that more and more @entity2 backbenchers believe the @entity40 mayor would be a better @entity2 leader than him			1
mr @entity4 would only be able to stand in a @entity2 leadership contest if he returned to the @entity21 - meaning an mp would have to offer to give up their seat to him			1
another complication is that he has pledged to stay on as mayor until 2016			0
blond ambition : sir @entity9 said that @entity4 would make an excellent leader of the @entity2 sir @entity9 , who as ‘ @entity49 ’ is the longest - serving mp , told the @entity50 he thought mr @entity4 would be an ‘ excellent ’ leader of the opposition and ‘ perhaps ’ even a good prime minister			1
but he added that his seat could be too far from @entity40 to be suitable for mr @entity4			2
‘ the problem is my seat is a long way from the tv studios , ’ said sir @entity9 , who has a majority of nearly 14,000			2
‘ @entity4 would want to be closer to them			0
’ the offer comes as a @entity61 poll showed that @entity10 has surged to 17 per cent in the polls , taking support from the @entity64			0
lurking danger : the @entity66 @entity10 , led by @entity67 is proving an electoral threat for conservatives the conservatives polled just 28 per cent , behind @entity14 on 37 per cent but ahead of the @entity12 on just 9 per cent			0
a separate poll by @entity72 found that @entity10 ’s policies are favoured over the @entity64 ’ among key right - of - centre voters - particularly on immigration , government spending and same - sex marriage			0
among those who say they have yet to decide which of the two parties to vote for - around one in ten of all voters - more favour @entity10 leader @entity67 and mr @entity4 over the prime minister			1
in the running : @entity66 's first black @entity2 mp @entity85 has also been hotly tipped as a future party leader @entity87 , the mp for @entity88 who had the @entity2 whip suspended last year for appearing on a reality tv show , said the @entity64 needed a ‘ change of direction ’ in order to stop the flight to @entity10			1
‘ it seems @entity10 ’s march in the polls is hardening , ’ she told @entity95			0
‘ i think there is a very stark lesson for conservatives to be taken from this and of course it all follows on from the @entity103 by - election			0
’ yesterday @entity2 backbencher @entity85 , who has been accused of plotting a leadership bid despite only having been elected in 2005 , declined to state that he believes mr @entity7 will still be leader by the election			1
asked repeatedly on the @entity109 ’s @entity108 show , he said : ‘ i ’m not prepared to speculate , because i think what people want to see from their politicians is they want to see leadership and a commitment to getting @entity66 back on top			0
’ asked about his leadership ambitions , mr @entity85 said : ‘ i ’m not ambitious for any position in government or any position at all in the party			0
what i ’m ambitious for is for the @entity66 people to get jobs , and you know , to feel proud of their country again			0

longest serving mp @entity9 said @entity4 would be ' an excellent leader '
*embattled* leader @entity7 faces *renewed* *pressure* from @entity10
@entity2 backbencher @entity85 is also a popular choice to replace @entity7
