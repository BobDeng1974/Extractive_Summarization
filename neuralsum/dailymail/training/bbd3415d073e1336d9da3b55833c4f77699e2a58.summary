living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms ' lives can be applied to humans , scientists have said			1
@entity8 researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm @entity10 and boosted the creature 's lifespan by a factor of five			1
the research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , they said			1
@entity8 scientists tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm @entity10 ( pictured ) and boosted the creature 's lifespan by a factor of five ‘ what we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan , ’ said lead scientist dr @entity23 , from the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26			1
‘ the two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan			2
‘ basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years			1

two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that enabled worms to live to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years while it could take years of research to extend humans ’ lives dramatically , the study raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments informed by genetic interactions , according to dr @entity23			1
‘ in the early years , cancer researchers focused on mutations in single genes , but then it became apparent that different mutations in a class of genes were driving the disease process , ’ he said			0
while it could take years of research to extend humans ' lives , the study raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments informed by genetic interactions ‘ the same thing is likely happening in ageing , ’ he added			1
@entity10 , the first animal to have its whole genome ( or genetic code ) mapped , has been widely used in studies of ageing and lifespan			1
the new research , reported in the journal @entity80 , involved blocking key molecules that affect the action of insulin and a nutrient signalling pathway called @entity85 ( @entity86 )			0
single mutations in the @entity86 pathway were known to extend the lifespan of @entity10 by 30 per cent , while insulin - signalling mutations could double the amount of time they lived			2
adding the two together might have been expected to extend longevity by 130 per cent , but the combined impact turned out to be much greater			0
the research may explain why it has proved so difficult to identify single genes responsible for the long lives enjoyed by human centenarians			2
‘ it 's quite probable that interactions between genes are critical in those fortunate enough to live very long , healthy lives , ’ said dr @entity23			0
future research is expected to use mice to see if the same effects occur in mammals			1
‘ the idea would be to use mice genetically engineered to have suppressed insulin signalling and then treat them with the drug rapamycin , which is well - known to suppress the @entity86 pathway , ’ dr @entity23 said			0
earlier this year @entity115 scientists captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm , by studying the blue fluorescence that travels cell - to - cell until the whole organism is dead			2
researchers from the @entity124 and the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) likened the spread of the blue glow travelling through the worm 's body to that of the @entity130 , stalking death			0
they believe that the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people and perhaps even lead to an increase in life expectancy			0
when individual cells die , they trigger a chemical chain reaction that leads to the breakdown of cell components and a build - up of molecular debris			0
the molecular mechanisms of this are reasonably well understood at a cellular level but we know much less about how death spreads throughout an organism at the end of its life			0
in worms , the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm			2
the study , published in @entity162 , reveals that this fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling			0

@entity26 scientists tweaked two genetic pathways in the worm *caenorhabditis* *elegans* to amplify its lifespan
they said the worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years
research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , and the next step is to *investigate* if the effects occur in mice
