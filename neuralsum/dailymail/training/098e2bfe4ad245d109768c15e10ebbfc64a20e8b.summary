by @entity0 published : 08:42 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 12:14 est , 28 november 2012 these photographs capture the retreat of glaciers in one of @entity6 's most beautiful national parks			1
after 100 years of climate change , only 25 out of the 150 glaciers recorded at the @entity8 in @entity9 still exist			1
as these pictures show , places where the ice was once many metres thick have been replaced with sediment , pastures and lakes			2
right , by 2008 a man looks down from the same spot and can see lakes and sediment there were previously hidden beneath metres of ice @entity31 - inspiring : the @entity19 glacier fills the basin at @entity23 mountain range in the @entity24 in 1900 shrunken : the @entity19 had greatly receded by 2008 icy : a third view of the @entity19 showing how it filled the basin of the @entity23 mountain range in 1900 going : by 2010 it had receded to reveal the great swathes of sediment beneath dr @entity42 , who leads the @entity43 responsible for researching glaciers in the park , predicts that its glaciers will completely disappear in the coming decades			1
he believes they are melting because of natural climate changes ' accelerated ' by human influence			0
' the mountains are still very beautiful and they are a legacy of glaciers carving them and sculpting them , ' he said			2
' but there would most definitely be an irony that it was a glacier-less glacier national park			2
' once mighty : the large @entity57 glacier stretches far at @entity8 in 1911 no longer : by 2005 , when this picture was taken , the glacier has shrunk dramatically deep freeze : a large @entity61 located at @entity8 in 1940 since thawed : that glacier as photographed by researchers in 2008 you would n't get far on skis : the @entity67 glacier stretches far at @entity8 in 1914 , left			1
right , the same glacier had nearly disappeared by 2009 the disappearance of the ice is likely to further affect the wider ecosystem and could threaten species of fish adapted to living in waters kept cold by the glaciers , he added			1
the @entity77 yesterday warned as much as 44billion tons of nitrogen and 850billion tons of carbon could be released into the environment as permafrost thaws over the next century			2
this release of greenhouse gases could make much worse and threaten delicate water systems on land and offshore , the scientists said			0
their warning came after the @entity89 last week warned of record levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , which will likely remain trapped there causing temperatures to continue to rise for centuries			0
snowy peaks : the @entity99 glacier and @entity101 glacier join together at @entity8 in 1914 now just a sprinkle : the @entity99 glacier and @entity101 glacier have greatly receded and are no longer connected ice age : the @entity106 glacier fills the basin in @entity8 in 1913 heating up : the glacier has shrunk greatly and only patches remain chilled : the @entity111 glacier , the largest in the park , spreads out across the @entity24 global warming : the glacier is still the park 's largest , but its disappearance now leaves massive sections of mountain visible these photographs , known as glacier pairs or repeat photographs , show the tangible effects of the rising climate believed to be caused by the accumulation of so many pollutants			1
they have been taken from the same vantage points or fields of view , but with some of the originals dating back as far as 1900 , to document how global warming is affecting glaciers			0
and the same phenomenon is being repeated all over the world , according to dr @entity135 , a glacier expert from the @entity137			0
' the retreating glaciers seen in these photos are common to most mountain glaciers around the world including examples from the @entity143 , the @entity144 and tropical glaciers in the @entity146 , ' he said			0
' part of the retreat is likely due to natural causes but part is also likely due to human induced warming of the planet over the last century			0

a century *ago* the @entity9 nature reserve had 150 glaciers ; now only 25 remain within its borders
expert from the @entity43 predicts the last of @entity8 's ice will be gone in decades
the disappearance of the glaciers threatens to *disrupt* ecosystems and change the environment of the park
