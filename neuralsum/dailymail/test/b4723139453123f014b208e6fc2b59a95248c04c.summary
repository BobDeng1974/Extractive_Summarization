@entity0 is the rat capital of the @entity2 and the @entity3 of @entity4 has the most mice , cockroaches and bed bugs , according to new research			1
the @entity10 city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014			2
@entity14 is officially the most pest - infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on @entity19 reporting problems with rats , cockroaches , wasps and other creepy crawlies			1
the @entity26 city was followed by the @entity27 where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems , and in @entity30 , @entity31 , 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators			2
officials at the @entity46 warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest - buster services			1
they said that , while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common , the overall trend across the @entity2 was an increase in numbers			0
for example , while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as @entity70 , areas such as @entity65 , in @entity66 , are much more prone to ants			0
@entity66 as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years , will call - outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold			1
a graph compiled by the @entity46 shows @entity78 is the most rat - infested country in the @entity2 ( left ) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country ( right _ while inner - city areas such as @entity0 and @entity70 were plagued by rats and cockroaches , more rural areas such as @entity85 were overrun by wasps ( pictured ) meanwhile , residents of @entity85 in @entity66 were the most likely to report problems with wasps			1

@entity108 , chief executive of the @entity102 , said : ' our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control			0
' there are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest , but there 's certainly a recurring theme			0
' if an infestation of any pest is n't dealt with quickly and professionally , it 's likely to spread			0
' the problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health			0
' @entity128 numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years ( left ) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country ( right ) the number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in @entity66 in the last five years , data showed , with those in @entity65 most likely to report a problem			2
