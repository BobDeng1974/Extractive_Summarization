@entity5 , 36 , had been searching for his missing border terrier @entity7 for a week when he received devastating news that a dog had been found dead next to a busy road			1
a heartbroken @entity5 and his girlfriend @entity11 , 35 , went to the scene and as the dead dog was barely recognisable , the couple thought it was their beloved @entity7			1
@entity7 went missing after he ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk in @entity18 , near @entity19 , on december 10 the tearful couple said their goodbyes and buried the dog , but two days later @entity5 received a phone call from a lady who had found @entity7			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity19 , said : ' it 's unbelievable , but true			1
it really is a @entity27 miracle			0
we got a call from a lovely lady saying she found him in her garden			2
' she managed to get him to come for food and she popped a lead on him			0
she then got him some food and water and called us			0
we got a very warm welcome from him and he 's now sleeping in his favourite place			0
' sadly , we buried another wee doggy that we thought was @entity7			2
it was the same colour and the same size but it was very difficult to identify			0
we had no reason not to think it was him			0
' @entity7 ran off chasing a deer during a lunchtime walk with mr @entity5 and ms @entity11 in @entity18 , near @entity19 , on december 10			1
the couple printed off more than 1,000 flyers and 100 posters in their hunt for the dog , and mr @entity5 even took a week off work to concentrate on the search			1
five days later , they received the news they were dreading : a black and tan border terrier had been lying dead on the @entity61 , within three miles of where @entity7 was last seen			1
the couple printed off more than 1,000 flyers and 100 posters in their hunt for the dog , and mr @entity5 even took a week off work to concentrate on the search the couple retrieved the body and buried him near a walking route beside @entity67			1
however , two days later their grieving was interrupted by a phone call from a resident in nearby @entity72 , who had spotted a ' missing ' poster they had placed on @entity75			1
she said she had @entity7 , and that he was fit and well			2
mr @entity5 said : ' i could n't believe it			1
to say we had given up hope was an understatement			0
we had just buried him , after all			2
' he was limping slightly and had a bit of a wild look in his eye , but other than that he was fine			0
we took him to the vet and found that he had lost over a kilo in weight			0
it 's thought that he survived by maybe feeding on a dead deer carcass			0
