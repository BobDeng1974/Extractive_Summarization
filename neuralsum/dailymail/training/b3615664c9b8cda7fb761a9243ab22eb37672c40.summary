former secretary of state @entity0 told the @entity3 magazine @entity2 on tuesday that she and her husband @entity4 were indeed ' deeply in debt ' when they left the @entity6 and blamed ' relentless persecution ' by @entity8 for her legal bills after his presidency			1
the claim has added fuel to the fire @entity13 herself touched off last month when she claimed they were ' dead broke ' after their time in the @entity6			1
the former first lady earns $ 200,000 or more every time she makes a public speech			1
the former president has earned a reported $ 104 million in speaking fees since he left the @entity23 behind him			1
the power couple has also raised more than $ 1 billion in political contributions for @entity26 and their own foundation in the last two decades			2
' ' you recently described your financial situation during the presidency of your husband @entity13 as dead broke , ' @entity2 's @entity45 and @entity46 reminded her			1
' well , ' @entity13 responded			2
when we came out of the @entity6 , we were deeply in debt because of all the legal bills that we owed because of the relentless persecution of my husband and myself , and he had to work unbelievably hard to pay off every single penny of every debt we owed			1
' that ' persecution ' was related to president @entity13 's impeachment for lying under oath as an independent prosecutor probed his extramarital affair with a @entity6 intern			1
but today , the interviewers said , ' you are multimillionaires			0
your husband has earned $ 104 million with his speeches since 2001			2
' ' we are very grateful for where we are today , ' she responded			0
' but if you were to go back and look at the amount of money that we owed , we could n't even get a mortgage on a house by ourselves			2
in our system he had to make double what he needed in order just to pay off the debt , and then to finance a house and continue to pay for our daughter 's education			0
' today the @entity84 own a sprawling home in @entity86 , @entity87 and a lavish apartment in @entity87 , and summer in the tony @entity89			0
yet mrs. @entity0 said ' i do agree ' with the magazine 's premise that ' the growing gap between the rich and the poor is threatening democracy			1
' ' the average annual income of an @entity36 household is $ 22,296 ( â‚¬ 16,397 ) , ' @entity2 told her			1
' you earn up to $ 200,000 an hour for a speech			1
can you understand if people are bothered by that ? ' ' well , certainly , i can understand that , ' she responded , ' but that 's never been the crux of the concern in our country , because we 've always had people who did better than other people			0
' @entity0 also parried @entity36 's national unease about sending a second @entity13 to the @entity6 , following two @entity112 and a possible third in @entity113			1
dynasty ? former @entity115 gov. @entity113 could be the third @entity113 in the @entity6 , and @entity0 could be the second @entity13 -- but she insists that @entity116 and @entity117 did n't lead to an @entity36 monarchy republicans and @entity26 alike have expressed concerns about the wisdom of formalizing a political dynasty that already exists in practice			1
' will the @entity36 democracy turn into a monarchy ? ' she was asked			1
' we had two roosevelts			0
we had two @entity128 , ' she responded			2
' it may be that certain families just have a sense of commitment or even a predisposition to want to be in politics			0
i ran for president , as you remember			0
i lost to somebody named @entity139 , so i do n't think there is any guarantee in @entity36 politics			2
my last name did not help me in the end			0
' ' our system is open to everyone , ' she added			0
' it is not a monarchy in which i wake up in the morning and abdicate in favor of my son			0
' @entity13 is already a presumptive favorite for @entity26 in 2016			2
a @entity155 poll published tuesday showed her with the backing of 58 per cent of voters in a hypothetical @entity26 primary race			0
@entity161 sen. @entity160 came was a distant second with 11 per cent			0
@entity113 , the former @entity115 governor , came in second among a tightly packed @entity8 crowd with 10 percent , trailing @entity166 sen. @entity165 by one point .			0

former secretary of state told @entity2 that ' legal bills that we owed because of the relentless persecution of my husband and myself ' left them ' deeply in debt '
@entity0 has made foot - in - mouth claims that she and the former president were ' dead broke '
she earns $ 200,000 per speech but told the magazine that income *inequality* is a threat to @entity36 democracy
she also parried *criticism* about a possible @entity13 dynasty , saying @entity36 ' had two roosevelts . we had two @entity128 '
