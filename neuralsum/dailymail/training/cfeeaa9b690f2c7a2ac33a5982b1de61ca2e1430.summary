these despicable images show four men about to be put to death by @entity3 in @entity4 , apparently because they are spies			1
the shocking pictures emerged just hours after campaign group cage defended @entity7 , today unmasked as west @entity9 student @entity8 , as ' beautiful ' and a man who ' would n't hurt a fly '			1
the scarcely believable comments about @entity8 were made by cage leader @entity13 at a press conference in which he blamed @entity15 for radicalising the @entity17 graduate			1
the gruesome murders were filmed , expertly edited and distributed in the name of @entity21			0
jihadi @entity7 's trademark black hood can be seen covering the faces of the four executioners in the latest pictures , thought to have been taken in @entity50 in @entity4			1
each man was accused of being part of a spy ring and were executed under the crime of spying for the @entity56 government			0
clad in the familiar orange jumpsuits the victims , named as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , are pictured being marched into a clearing under the dark gaze of their killers			2
amid bright sunlight filtered through surrounding trees , they are photographed standing separately while their three alleged accomplices kneel with their heads down in the background			0
@entity62 fixes the camera with a defiant gaze , moments before he is apparently shot and killed a snapshot of the slick webpage on which the images were posted , including graphic black and white shots @entity59 appears more afraid as he is shown with his alleged accomplices behind some of their faces show defiance and others fear , before they are lined up on their knees with their black - clad killers standing behind			1
in gut - wrenching images the four are then seen slumped on the ground , apparently having been shot in cold blood , as their @entity3 murderers raise hand guns in the air			1
blood pools around the heads of the dead men , which are shown in close - up in images too horrific to reproduce			1
earlier today @entity13 was branded an @entity3 sympathiser as he appeared to launch a defence of @entity8 and his barbaric crimes			1
he described @entity8 as ' the most humble young person that i knew ' , adding : ' he was such a beautiful young man , really			2
' it 's hard to imagine the trajectory , but it is not a trajectory that 's unfamiliar with us			0
' when are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they 're outsiders , they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere			0
' about to meet his death , @entity60 is pictured handcuffed my the militants the four , including @entity61 , were killed because they were allegedly spies he also revealed that he 'd been in regular contact with @entity8 before he left for @entity121			1
in the wake of @entity8 's unmasking as the world 's most wanted man , cage yesterday released a statement entitled ' @entity128 '			1
the release stated that @entity8 ' desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation , but the system ultimately rejected him , ' a view later echoed on @entity126 's press conference , which was broadcast live on both @entity135 and @entity136			2
@entity13 then used the statement to criticise the @entity39 security services , arguing that counter-terror measures turned young @entity140 into extremists			0
other videos have emerged of @entity13 suggesting he is a jihadi apologist , including oneat an anti-us rally in @entity9 at which he is filmed urging protesters to ' support the jihad of our brothers and sisters ' in @entity4 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			2
@entity13 can be seen speaking through a microphone at the the pan-islamic @entity156 movement rally			0
cage leader @entity157 ( left ) pictured at the press conference where he defended @entity8 , seen right in the guise of the infamous @entity7 @entity13 pictured at a @entity9 rally at the height of the @entity4 war in 2006 calling for protesters to ' support the jihad of our brothers and sisters ' he says : ' when we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in @entity153 , @entity4 , @entity152 , @entity168 , @entity151 , then we know where the example lies			1
' when we see @entity171 defeating the armies of @entity173 , we know where the solution is and where the victory lies			0
' we know that it is incumbent upon all of us , to support the @entity179 of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the @entity183			0
' @entity184 ! @entity184 ! ( @entity185 is great , @entity185 is great ! ) ' @entity13 stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip , shot at the height of the @entity4 and @entity151 wars in 2006			2
and in a second video , in which @entity13 is quizzed by @entity191 on his view of @entity194 law , in particularl stoning , he said : ' i agree with @entity198 concepts of how we practice our punishments			0
' asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty , he added : ' from an @entity198 perspective , yes			0
as long as all the due process elements are met			0
