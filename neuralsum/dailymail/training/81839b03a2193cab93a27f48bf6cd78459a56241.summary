by @entity0 last updated at 11:48 am on 3rd october 2011 housed in a dome almost the size of @entity4 and containing a mirror nearly half the length of a football pitch , it was n’t exactly rocket science for astronomers to find a name for this telescope			1
and , sure enough , they came up with the @entity12 – just about the only routine thing about the world ’s largest and most powerful ‘ eye on the sky ’			1
astronomers reckon it may finally shed light on whether there really is life somewhere out there by helping them find @entity24 - like rocky worlds that are home to other beings			1
and @entity28 scientists might be among the first to find out – as their work is crucial to the project			1
key instruments for the telescope will be developed thanks to £ 3.5million funding from the @entity35			2
the device in the @entity37 , @entity38 , will be built in a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium			1
it has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater than any previous telescope , and is designed to help astronomers peer back to the first galaxies 14billion years ago			2
this could unlock secrets of dark matter and dark energy – little - understood forces in space – to help explain how the universe evolved , according to the plans			2
the @entity28 instruments are being developed by the universities of @entity60 and @entity61 , with the @entity62 and @entity63			2
they will include spectrometers to analyse the light received from space , as well as gadgets to help remove blurring distortions caused by the @entity24 ’s atmosphere , a process known as adaptive optics			0
this will produce pictures 15 times sharper than those taken by the @entity77 space telescope , which has been in orbit since 1990			0
professor @entity79 , @entity12 project scientist at the @entity61 , said : ‘ this new financial commitment from the @entity35 means that @entity28 astronomers will have access to the earliest scientific results from this revolutionary telescope – an exciting prospect			0
’ the @entity37 , pictured , is a favoured location for the project because the dryness and clarity of the air provide exceptional observing conditions it is believed the telescope will bring hundreds of millions of pounds of benefits to @entity28 companies involved in building it			0
they include a consortium based at the @entity99 in @entity100 , which is developing prototypes for the huge segments needed to make the 43 - yard mirror			0
engineers will have to blast the top off @entity38 ’s 9,900ft @entity107 mountain peak to build the telescope if final approval is given by the @entity111 ’s 15 international partners in december			1
it is hoped the observatory will be operating by 2020			0
the e-elt will be the latest tool to join observatories operated in @entity38 by @entity116			1
the @entity37 is a favoured location because the dryness and clarity of the air provide exceptional observing conditions			0
established telescopes include the @entity122 , a set of dishes that forms the highest observatory in the world at 16,000ft			0
established telescopes include the @entity122 , pictured , a set of dishes that forms the highest observatory in the world at 16,000ft the @entity122			0
when the project is finished it will consist of 66 high precision antennas that will work as a single telescope located at 5000 of altitude in the extremely arid desert			1

the device will be built in the @entity38 desert in a dome the size of a stadium
