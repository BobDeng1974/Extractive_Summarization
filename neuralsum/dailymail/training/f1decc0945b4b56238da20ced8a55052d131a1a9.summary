whether it 's working up the nerve to ask your boss for a pay rise or finally plucking up the courage to ask the handsome guy from the gym for a date , there 's no shortage of situations where a little extra courage would n't hurt			0
but , while many overcome their nerves , studies have shown that women are more likely to succumb to a lack of confidence - with disastrous results for their career and love life			1
now , a new blog aims to help women face down their fears by encouraging them to submit photos revealing what they would do if they were n't afraid			2
this woman thinks she 's worth more than she 's paid but is afraid to ask for a rise one poster would learn to ignore negativity while another would be brave and pitch that book called what would you do if you were n't afraid , the blog is hosted on @entity37 chief operating officer @entity36 's lean in website and was inspired by a speech she made at @entity41			1
' the inspiration for the project came from a speech @entity45 gave to the graduating class at @entity41 a few years go that ended with the question ' what would you do if you were n't afraid ? ' , says @entity52 editor , @entity51			1
' as graduation rolled around this year , we wanted to find a way to play off that question to encourage women to pursue their ambitions -- but this is clearly a message that women ( and many men ) of any age can relate to			2
' among the women who have already submitted photos is @entity63 , 15 , from @entity64 in @entity65 who writes : ' i would lead without worrying what people think + prefacing my ideas with " maybe " or " i do n’t know , but … " ' the blog is hosted on the website of @entity37 coo @entity36 ( pictured ) @entity73 from @entity74 would take more control of her own life and stop going with the flow another , @entity73 , 43 , from @entity74 , writes : ' i ’ve taken the first step and created a career and business for myself that i can fit my life in to , instead of trying to fit my life in to someone else ’s idea of what a career for me should be			1
' now i need to take the next step and fully take ownership of everything … professional and personal			0
' @entity36 herself has also submitted a photo and a pledge that reads : ' i would write a book about women			1
' ' we wanted to make the point that women often hold themselves back by fear of the unknown : fear of failure , fear of speaking up , fear of being judged , ' added @entity51			0
' part of leaning in is about overcoming our fears to pursue our ambitions -- whatever those may be			0
so why not put our fears out there ? ' why not talk about them ? hold them up on a sign ? we hope this blog will inspire women to ask themselves , ' what would i do if i were n't afraid ? ' and then to go and do it			0
' to find out more and to submit a pledge and photo of your own , see @entity119 @entity120 would finally call herself an author and take the credit she deserves for her work @entity124 , 29 , from @entity74 , would file for non-profit status and help victims of domestic violence			0
