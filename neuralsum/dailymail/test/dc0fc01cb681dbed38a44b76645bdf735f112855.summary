@entity0 knows he must expand his repertoire to aid his bid for @entity4 glory			1

@entity0 , who races in the @entity13 @entity10 event this weekend , plans to use 2015 to experiment with tactics in a bid to arrive at the start gate in @entity18 full of confidence			1
@entity0 in action during the @entity21 , and the 26 - year - old is hoping for glory in @entity18 ' there are certain areas i need to improve to get on the gate in @entity18 and know that i 've done everything i can to be as good , if not better , than my competitors in every single area , ' @entity0 said			1
' the sport is continuing to improve and i need to continue to improve			0
' there 's challenges this season that i would love to accomplish , which do n't necessarily mean going to a race and winning			0
' last year in @entity36 i was in second and almost passed the reigning @entity4 champion ( @entity38 's @entity37 ) for the win			1
' that 's something i feel i 'd like a little bit more exposure to - not being out in front and having to try to pass some of the best guys to come back and win			0
that would add to my box of tricks come the @entity4			0
' @entity48 would dearly love to reclaim the world title he won in @entity51 two years ago at this year 's @entity52 in @entity53 in july			1
2013 @entity54 hopes to use this year to hone his tactics ahead of the @entity57 the @entity59 ace was the taken out by an ill - thought manoeuvre by @entity62 's @entity61 in @entity63 last year , ending his stint in the rainbow jersey			1
@entity0 knows his performances in recent seasons mean he is a key rival others will do anything to beat			2
' i do have a target on me , because i have performed at a high level over the last few years and i have been world champion , ' he added			2
' last year 's @entity52 was so frustrating because i sacrificed doing a few races before then because i wanted to chuck everything at retaining that title			2
' i was absolutely flying and i know that given the opportunity to continue racing i would certainly have been more than capable of retaining that , but that 's @entity8			0
' it 's just the nature of it			0
i do n't like to dwell on that			0
i want to push forward now			0
' @entity0 won the @entity13 @entity10 event in 2014 and knows he will be expected to perform once again on his home track in saturday 's time - trials and sunday 's @entity87 , where eight riders race at the same time			1
@entity0 failed to defend his title last year , but is determined to take it back this july in @entity53 he added : ' i look back at the @entity10 last year and i 've never experienced pressure like that			1
being reigning world champion , everybody expects you to win			2
' there 's 150 guys in the race , but everybody is looking at this as my race			0
it 's something i seem to be able to manage and thrive on in some respects			0
' @entity0 leads a five - rider @entity106 team , which also features 2014 @entity52 bronze medallist @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity111 is the only female representative , although three - time bmx world champion @entity112 is back in the @entity114 set - up , training with the track team .			2
