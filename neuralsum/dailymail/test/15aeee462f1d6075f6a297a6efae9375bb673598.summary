judges rejected home secretary @entity2 's attempt to deport the 53 - year - old serial criminal because of the risk of ' unacceptably savage ' abuse he faced in @entity7			1
it means he will be able to continue his drink - fuelled offending spree in @entity9			2
his case is estimated to have cost @entity9 taxpayers a six - figure sum , including the cost of police time , legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts and the costs of keeping him in prison			1
the case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws			1

' this kind of things drives people mad , ' he said			0
' on the doorstep they find cases like this outrageous			0
few people will think this man should remain in the country			0
he has completely abused our hospitality			0
' despite insisting the @entity7 had ' behaved disgracefully ' to rack up 78 crimes on 52 occasions , the @entity57 said deporting him would violate the @entity61 , incorporated into @entity9 law by the @entity44			1

the man , who was granted anonymity by the courts and can only be identified by the initials ' @entity100 ' , came to @entity9 in 1981 to study engineering			2
apart from a short period in @entity7 from august 1993 to october 1994 , he has remained here ever since			2
he had spent ' many years ' trying to deal with his alcohol dependency			0
during that time he had been imprisoned for a string of offences ' largely and possibly exclusively as a consequence of his alcoholism ' , the judge ruled			1
