@entity9 , 55 , was travelling the world with his partner @entity11 when they stopped to work on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the desert			1
the pair had been trekking and were miles from civilization when they came across the beautiful natural hot spring and decided to have an outdoor tryst			2
around 60 miles from a phone signal , ms @entity11 was forced to run three miles to flag down a trucker			2
mr @entity9 had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent a life - saving operation			1
but the artist , who did not have any travel insurance , was in for another shock when he was presented with a staggering $ 250,000 medical bill for his five - day stay			1
if that was n't bad enough , he was forced to return home and broke up with @entity42 , who remained in the @entity44 to work			1
despite his misfortune , mr @entity9 from @entity45 , @entity2 , insists his outdoor quickie was worth it			2
' it was the most expensive sex ever , ' he added			0
' i have n't been able to pay it off and although it 's always at the back of my mind , i have no regrets			0
' yes , i will never be able to forget that i owe so much money , but it was worth it for the sex			0
it 's always worth it			0
' but the tryst ended in disaster when mr @entity9 suffered a heart attacks moments afterwards and had to be airlifted to hospital pictured at the @entity66 , the pair were 60 miles away from phone signal when @entity9 collapsed forcing @entity42 to run three miles to flag down a trucker mr @entity9 and his partner of two years ms @entity11 were living in @entity72 when they embarked on a round - the - world trip in april 2013			1
after months on the road the pair flew to @entity44 and started working as chefs on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the @entity4 desert where they discovered the natural springs			1
mr @entity9 said : ' after we started working there , @entity42 and i took a walk around and discovered these beautiful natural hot springs all over the place			1
' we always used to sit in them and then one day we thought it would be romantic to make love in the pool			2
' when i got up there were pains in my left arm and i just collapsed			0
' we were miles from the ranch and even then , there was no phone signal to call anyone			0
i did n't know if i was going to make it , we were in the middle of nowhere			2
in hospital , pictured , mr @entity9 had life - saving stent placed in his heart , but after a five - day stay was presented with a staggering $ 250,000 medical bill if that was n't bad enough , he had to return home and broke up with @entity42 ( who he is pictured with at the ranch in @entity4 where they were staying ) who had to stay and work in the @entity44 ' it was astounding how remote it was			1
there was no internet or cellular signal for miles and the nearest town was more than three hours drive away			0
' ms @entity11 had no choice but to leave her partner alone while she flagged down the trucker who called the air ambulance on a satellite phone			2
two hours later mr @entity9 was airlifted to hospital and had a life - saving stent placed in his heart			1
but after a five - day stay in @entity130 hospital he almost suffered another heart attack when medics hit him with a bill for a quarter of a million dollars - or Â£ 165,000			1
he said : ' when i woke up i was in a and e. doctors fitted a stent and gave me lots of drugs to keep me alive			0
i was in there for five days before being discharged			0
' as i was leaving the doctors asked me how i planned on paying the bill			2
i was thinking it would be around $ 5,000 but could n't believe it when it all amounted to $ 250,000			1
' happier times : the couple were travelling the world together before the incident but mr @entity9 ( left , in @entity130 ) said his outdoor quickie with ms @entity11 ( right ) was worth it insisting he had ' no regrets ' unable to pay the bill , mr @entity9 travelled back to the @entity2 for further treatment while @entity42 stayed on the ranch , and the couple split in october 2014 , but remain friends			1
mr @entity9 is still negotiating with the hospital over the bill			1
he added : ' i 'm just really hoping i will be able to get the debt wiped because it will affect my future			0
' if the hospital decide i do have to pay back the full amount , i 'll never be able to go to @entity44 again			0
' stupidly , i did n't have travel insurance and although i was expecting a big bill i had to do a double take when i saw it was a quarter of a million dollars			0
' i was completely gobsmacked			0
i was n't working at the time as @entity42 and i had been travelling the world , so there was no way i could ever afford that			2
' it 's bizarre how things have turned out			0
i would be really upset if this meant i could never enter the country again			0
