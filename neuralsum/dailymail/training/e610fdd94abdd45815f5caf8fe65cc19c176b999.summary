by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 02:08 est , 13 june 2013 a previously unclassified type of star that gets lighter and darker over a fixed time period has been discovered			1
scientists have long known of ' pulsating ' stars that vary in luminosity but these new heavenly bodies get lighter and darker at periods of between two and 20 hours			1
they were found in a stellar cluster - ngc 3766 , in the constellation of @entity14 - located 7,000 light years from @entity15 by the @entity16 using the @entity17 in @entity18			1
a seven - year study found 36 of the 3,000 stars displayed the tiny variations in brightness			1
the 20 - million - year - old stars , hotter and brighter than our sun , do not fit into any known category of pulsating star and are as yet unnamed			1
stars hide your fires : a new type of variable star in the @entity14 constellation has been discovered by a group of @entity36 astronomers at @entity17 , @entity18 how the brightness of these stars changes depends in complex ways on the properties of their interiors			1
this phenomenon has allowed the development of a whole branch of astrophysics called asteroseismology , where astronomers can ' listen ' to these stellar vibrations , in order to probe the physical properties of the stars and get to know more about their inner workings			2
' the very existence of this new class of variable stars is a challenge to astrophysicists , ' says @entity57 , one of the team members involved in the study			2
' current theoretical models predict that their light is not supposed to vary periodically at all , so our current efforts are focused on finding out more about the behaviour of this strange new type of star			0
' @entity67 , leader of the research team , which used a 1.2 - metre @entity70 telescope to carry out the research , said : ' we have reached this level of sensitivity thanks to the high quality of the observations , combined with a very careful analysis of the data , but also because we have carried out an extensive observation programme that lasted for seven years			0
@entity17 in @entity18 , where the astronomers studied the @entity80 , found in the constellation of @entity14 , for seven years ' it probably would nâ€™t have been possible to get so much observing time on a bigger telescope			2
' although the cause of the 0.1 % variability in luminosity remains unknown , there is a tantalising clue : some of the stars seem to be rotate incredibly fast			0
they spin at speeds that are more than half of their critical velocity , which is the threshold where stars become unstable and throw off material into space			0
' in those conditions , the fast spin will have an important impact on their internal properties , but we are not able yet to adequately model their light variations , ' explains @entity67			0
' we hope our discovery will encourage specialists to address the issue in the hope of understanding the origin of these mysterious variations			0

the new stars vary their brightness over a fixed period of time - a previously *unheard* of phenomenon
the ' pulsating ' stars were found after a seven year study by the @entity36
they get lighter and darker like *clockwork* every two to twenty hours , baffling scientists
