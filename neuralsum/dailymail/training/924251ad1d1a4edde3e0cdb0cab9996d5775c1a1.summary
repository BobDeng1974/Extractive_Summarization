by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 insists he will not buckle under the pressure of being @entity6 's @entity5 number nine			1
@entity2 underlined his status as one of @entity10 's most promising strikers last season when he scored 21 goals in the @entity13			1
the 24 - year - old 's career has blossomed since he moved to @entity16 , where he formed a lethal partnership with top scorer @entity18 , but he is yet to repeat that kind of form on the international stage			0
@entity2 will be the spearhead of @entity6 's attack this summer , just as @entity24 and sir @entity25 were when they wore the famous number nine shirt on their back			1
' i do n't feel any pressure in terms of the task ahead because i feel that we have prepared for this , ' said @entity2 , whose three @entity6 goals have come against @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity33			1
' i am excited by it all			0
when you are young you always want these moments			0
this is my first @entity5			0
it 's about just embracing it all , not about feeling any pressure to do something amazing			0
' i just have to play my normal game			0
' @entity58 prevented @entity2 from playing alongside @entity59 for a chunk of last season			1
but @entity62 will hope the pair hit it off in friday 's friendly versus @entity65 , and the two other warm - up games that follow against @entity67 and @entity68			0
partners : @entity2 ( left ) says that he is confident that he can work well with @entity59 ( right ) debutant : this will be @entity2 's first @entity5 and he says he is looking forward to it another option for @entity62 is to play @entity59 and @entity2 alongside @entity73 's @entity30 in a three - man attack			1
many @entity6 fans remain indifferent about @entity30 despite his record of eight goals in 21 @entity6 games			1
the forward , who has been deployed in midfield for much of @entity73 's last two seasons , thinks the @entity5 could be place where he proves he deserves to be recognised as a top - class striker			1
' i just want to prove myself to me and to the world , ' @entity30 said			2
' i want to show everyone what i can do			0
going into the @entity5 is a massive stage and i ca n't wait to do that			0
' @entity30 had a stop - start season with @entity73 last year , but he still found the net 11 times - a significant improvement on the two he scored the year before			1
@entity30 looked in good shape during @entity6 's open training session in @entity95 do @entity96 on wednesday			2
better : @entity30 ( left ) improved greatly on his goal tally this season , scoring 11 times overall international : @entity30 ( left ) is seen as a key part of @entity62 's ( right ) plans much to his dismay , @entity59 was made to sit out the final part of that session as @entity62 does not want to take any risks with the @entity73 striker , who ended the season with a groin injury			1
@entity30 thinks his @entity73 team - mate is champing at the bit to return to action			2
he said : ' @entity59 is a great player for club and country			0
he is fit and raring to go and we all know what he can produce on the big stages so i am really excited to see him and what he can do for @entity6 in a @entity5			0
' @entity30 , who scored against @entity119 in @entity120 , is looking forward to getting the warm - up games out of the way so he can taste @entity5 football for the first time			2
' the training sessions have been good , ' said @entity30 , who made his @entity6 debut against @entity127 in march 2011			2
' everyone is really excited and they want to make sure they are ready for the @entity5			0
' team : @entity30 ( second left ) has played a very sefless role for @entity73 this season			1

@entity2 did well for @entity134 but is yet to replicate that form for @entity6
@entity134 forward scored 21 @entity13 goals this season
@entity30 says he wants to prove what he can do
the pair could lead the line with @entity73 striker @entity59
