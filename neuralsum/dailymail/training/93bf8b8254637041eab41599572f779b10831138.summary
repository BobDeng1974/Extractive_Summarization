@entity5 , alleged to be an explosives expert , previously won a @entity17 battle to have his citizenship restored , on the grounds that he had been rendered ' stateless '			2
but @entity4 has now ordered him to have his passport taken away again , claiming his terror links make him dangerous to the @entity7 public			1
the move will be welcomed by campaigners who have argued that @entity5 should be banned from returning to @entity7			0
however , human rights activists have spoken out against the decision , saying that it is unfair to strip someone of citizenship if they do not have a passport from another country			2
@entity35 , 56 , first came to @entity7 as an asylum seeker in 1992 , and eight years later he and his family were granted @entity7 citizenship			1
in september 2004 , he travelled to @entity11 , where he was captured by @entity40 forces during the height of the insurgency			0
he spent three years in @entity7 military detention , and on his release was stripped of his citizenship by @entity47 home secretary @entity46			1
this prevented him from returning to the @entity7 , and he has since been living in @entity49 with his third wife and eight children			0
in october , the @entity17 ruled that @entity5 should be given his passport back because he automatically lost his @entity11 citizenship when he became @entity7			1

@entity67 lawyers say that he could easily re-apply for @entity11 citizenship and would have to be given a passport by the country 's officials			1
however , his own lawyers insist that he is currently stateless and the decision breaches his human rights			0
solicitor @entity75 told the @entity76 : ' mr @entity35 was given less than an hour 's notice of the deprivation order and has not been provided with any detail of the allegations against him save for the vaguest of references to @entity84 extremism , an allegation he flatly denies			0
' a spokesman for the @entity67 said : ' the home secretary has the power to remove a person 's @entity7 citizenship where she considers it is conducive to the public good			1
' this individual has lodged an appeal against the home secretary 's decision to do so in his case and it would not be appropriate to comment further while litigation is ongoing			0
' mrs may has used her powers to strip suspected criminals of their @entity7 passports 20 times since the @entity104 came to power in 2010			2
the previous @entity106 carried out the procedure just five times in 13 years , including in the case of @entity5 .			0
