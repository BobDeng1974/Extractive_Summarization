the @entity0 have clearly had a word with @entity2 before saturday 's @entity3 as the @entity5 handler does not have a runner			1
the @entity8 marathon has been a benefit for the @entity11 operation which has dominated the feature for the past four years			1
the absence of a pipe representative means the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 will fancy their chances of landing another prestigious staying event			1
@entity16 has the ante - post favourite in @entity22 , who was ridiculously impressive at @entity24 on deep ground last time , travelling through the race like a horse well in advance of his current handicap mark			0
trainer @entity2 during the @entity32 at @entity33 topiary in the shape of a jockey and racehorse wearing a @entity3 advertisement he is difficult to oppose given the manner of that performance , while @entity44 hero @entity42 will also have his followers given the strength of his connections in this race and the fact he has been freshened up since @entity51			0
the layers look to have those two pegged , however , and there could be a little more juice in the price of @entity56 ( @entity8 , nap , 3.50 ) who hails from a yard that could not be in better form			2
five of @entity63 's last 11 runners have obliged , which is an outstanding feat given the size of his stable , and the selection looked a chaser capable of taking fairly high rank last year			2
he never quite lived up to that billing but the first - time headgear and tongue tie applied today could produce a better showing and he looks overpriced at his odds this morning			0
the coral.co.uk @entity77 looks a terrific race and @entity81 ( @entity80 , nb , 3.05 ) is taken to continue his rapid progress			0

@entity2 has dominated the @entity8 marathon for the past four years
however , he does not have a runner in this year 's staying event
his absence presents an opportunity for @entity16 and @entity17
@entity63 trained @entity83 has been in fantastic form lately
