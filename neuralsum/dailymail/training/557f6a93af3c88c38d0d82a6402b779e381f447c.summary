@entity0 recently teased a self - driving truck that it claims could hit the roads within the next decade			1
and now , the @entity4 firm has removed the camouflage from its @entity7 prototype to reveal even more features , including how the truck 's ' @entity9 ' will scan the road ahead			1
in addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track , the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control			2
in addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track , the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control the prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a @entity4 autobahn in july , during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck - maker @entity36			1
during the trial , the truck was covered in a camouflage , and trucker @entity38 was seen toying conspicuously with an @entity39 behind the wheel of the 40 - tonne heavy goods vehicle			0
clad in mystery - enhancing adhesive foil , the @entity0 prototype is equipped with aerodynamic fins and radar that scans the road 250 meters ahead			1
the system constantly monitors cars around it to stay in the same lane , and keep at the optimum speed set by the driver			0
it also makes fuller use of features already found in current production models , by networking on - board sensors with automatic braking , stability control and lane - warning systems			2
once the system is switched on , the driver 's seat can become an office chair or swivels to a ' rest position ' , @entity36 said - potentially allowing vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for truckers			1
however , to overtake or change lane , the driver must take manual control			0
this camouflage has now been removed			0
on the front of the truck is a series of @entity75 , which illuminate the front fascia and headlights when the engine is started			1
when the lights flash orange , it alerts fellow drivers to the fact the truck is driving itself , and these lights turn blue when a human driver is back in control			1
@entity87 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining driver 's seat , tablet computer controls and ' mirrors ' and a chill - out space			1
the driver â€™s seat can also be turned by 45 degrees , to make it more comfortable on long journeys , and the tablet can be removed and used to watch films , for example , when the truck is in autonomous mode			1
the truck is also equipped with radar sensors and camera technology that helps the autonomous driving system , called @entity9 , plot the road ahead			1
the technology is similar to how an autopilot on an aircraft works , and in the @entity108 , the stereo camera scans the road 328ft ( 100 metres ) ahead ; 45 degrees horizontally and 27 degrees vertically			2
these cameras can identify single and two - lane roads , obstacles including moving and stationary objects , pedestrians and more			0
the camera is fitted to the instrument panel behind the windscreen			0
@entity108 2025 also makes fuller use of features already found in current production models , by networking on - board sensors with automatic braking , stability control and lane - warning systems			2
as the vehicle 's name suggests , the intention is to launch a roadworthy version by 2025			0
on the front of the truck is a series of @entity75 , which illuminate the front fascia and headlights with white lights when the engine is started			1
when the lights are blue ( pictured right ) , a human driver is in control @entity87 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining driver 's seat , tablet computer controls and ' mirrors ' and a chill - out space			1
the driver 's seat can be reclined and turned by 45 degrees , to make it more comfortable on long journeys ( pictured ) the vehicle is still a prototype , and is still undergoing tests , but it has been built to travel at speeds of up to 80 km / h ( 50 mph )			1
the world 's biggest truckmaker is confident its technology can overcome regulatory and legal hurdles - even if the scale of wage and fuel savings on offer spells likely conflict with freight unions in the long run			2
following the tests in july , @entity36 chief @entity163 said : ' autonomous driving will revolutionise road freight transport and create major benefits , ' said ' we aim to be the number one manufacturer in this market of the future which we believe will offer solid revenue and earnings potential			1
' ' this truck will not just remain a prototype , ' @entity163 said			0
this image reveals a comfortable , chill - out space in the cabin of the @entity7 prototype			1
as the vehicle 's name suggests , @entity0 's intention is to launch a roadworthy version over the next decade the @entity4 firm demonstrated a camouflaged version of the @entity7 prototype in july			2
it was driven on a @entity188 , and was a major step in an escalating race to develop self - driving vehicles in addition to @entity194 's self - driving cars , @entity196 's @entity195 , a unit of @entity198 , is also working on ' platooning ' technology that allows several trucks to travel in tight convoy with a sole human driver in the lead vehicle			1
@entity205 driving proponents face the twin challenges of meeting safety concerns while persuading lawmakers that accident liability can still be established			0
but the potential gains may offer powerful incentives to overcome them			0
@entity36 said its truck model still requires human oversight while freeing the driver to perform back - office tasks such as handling bookings and billing , or planning future itineraries			2
fuel and driver wages each account for 27 per cent of current operating costs for a typical haulage firm , according to a study by @entity227 's @entity226 , a government agency that monitors the sector			0
' once you include travelling expenses , total driver costs rise to a full third , the biggest item , ' a @entity226 official said			0
during the trial , trucker @entity38 was toying conspicuously with an @entity39 behind the wheel of his 40 - tonne heavy goods vehicle even without removing the drivers , he added , ' their share of total cost will fall if there are other productivity gains - if you use a little less driver for a given distance , so to speak			0
' the automated vehicles also save fuel by driving more economically , according to @entity36			0
even once legal and technological obstacles are cleared , however , self - driving trucks may face further resistance - not least from unions that wield serious clout in many countries			0
' we would have concerns , ' said @entity256 , a transport official at @entity257 , @entity258 's biggest union			0
' we need to maintain the very high standards that we 've got , ' he said			0
' what 's the point being there if you 're not paying any attention and you 're not supervising in effect ? ' opposition is also likely in @entity227 , where the government last year scrapped an environmental truck tax after widespread protests brought highways to a halt			0
@entity276 representatives will be ' extremely vigilant about the impact on jobs , wages and road safety ' if attempts are made to introduce self - driving trucks , the @entity274 - based @entity273 union said			2
' we must resist any temptation to consider that a driver is resting when the truck is on auto - pilot , ' spokesman @entity286			2
' that 's not what happens in planes , for good reason			0
' how it works : the truck can scan the road ahead for vehicles and monitor them , ensuring there are no collisions			1
the driver 's seat can become an office chair or swivels to a ' rest position ' , @entity36 said - potentially allowing vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for truckers			1
a tablet is used to control the system , and drivers can also see routes and information about the truck			2
