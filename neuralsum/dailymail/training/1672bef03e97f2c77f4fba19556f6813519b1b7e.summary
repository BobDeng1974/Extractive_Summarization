smart pills ? @entity2 is part of a family of blood pressure drugs called @entity7 inhibitors which could boost patients ' brain power , research suggests doctors have long recognised that taking blood pressure drugs may slow the onset of @entity13 ’s			1
now researchers have uncovered the first evidence that the drugs , called @entity7 inhibitors , may actually boost brainpower			1
those with high blood pressure are more at risk of developing @entity13 ’s and similar diseases , but the study found their memory and thinking skills were protected by the drugs they were taking			1
@entity7 inhibitors – whose names include ramipril , captopril and perindopril – have become increasingly popular in the past ten years , particularly for younger patients			1
researchers in @entity32 and @entity33 investigated drugs which target a specific biochemical pathway called the renin angiotensin system – a hormone system which is thought to affect the development of @entity13 ’s			1
the study compared the rate of cognitive decline in 361 patients diagnosed with @entity13 ’s disease , vascular dementia ( caused by problems in blood supply to the brain ) , or a mix of both			1
of that group , 85 were already taking ace inhibitors ; the rest were not			1
the researchers also analysed the impact on 30 patients , with an average age of 77 years , who were taking the drugs for the first time			0
they were assessed over six months , using the @entity60 or the @entity62 tests			0
those taking @entity7 inhibitors experienced marginally slower rates of cognitive decline than those who were not , found the study in the journal @entity69			1
meanwhile , the brainpower of those patients who had been newly prescribed @entity7 inhibitors actually improved , the experts from @entity71 in @entity32 and @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity33 found			2
it is the first evidence to suggest these drugs may not only halt cognitive decline , but may actually improve brainpower			0
the researchers said : ‘ although the differences were small and of uncertain clinical significance , if sustained over years , compounding effects may well have significant clinical benefits			0
’ they warn that @entity7 inhibitors are harmful to some patients , so if larger studies confirm they work well in dementia , it may be only certain people with high blood pressure who stand to benefit			2
caveat : researchers warn that @entity7 inhibitors are harmful to some patients , so if larger studies confirm they work well in dementia , it may be only certain people with high blood pressure who stand to benefit previous studies have linked other forms of blood pressure medication with anti-dementia benefits			2
dr @entity100 of the @entity101 said : ‘ any drug which halts cognitive decline is potentially exciting because it has the ability to radically improve quality of life			0
’ but dr @entity107 of @entity108 said : ‘ this is a short study with a small number of participants			0
it is unclear if the [ improvement ] could be due to the control of blood pressure , a different effect of the drugs or another factor			0
’ among the most widely used @entity7 inhibitors are perindopril ( also known as @entity121 ) , ramipril ( @entity123 ) , captopril ( @entity124 ) , trandolapril ( @entity126 ) , fosinopril ( @entity128 ) , lisinopril ( @entity2 and prinivil )			2
they work by stopping the body from creating the hormone angiotensin ii. this has a variety of effects but essentially relaxes blood vessels and helps reduce the amount of water re-absorbed by the kidneys – helping decrease blood pressure .			0
