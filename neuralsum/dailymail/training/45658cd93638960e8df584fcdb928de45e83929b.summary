' it means that we never get a lie - in at weekends as we wake up when mr @entity2 does , and it makes the children think that this is what people do			2
' this is not like living near to a public house or a train line , it ’s an entirely voluntary act by this man who did n’t get his own way over one thing and has decided to make his neighbours ' lives hell			0
' we deeply regret ever having moved next to mr seed			0
it has had a ruinous effect on what should have been the best years of our lives with our young family			0

' he has been retired a long time and has a lot of time on his hands , and that 's the problem in this situation			0
