@entity0 , which wound to a close yesterday , came and went quicker than you can say @entity2			1
while many people dismiss the five - day style event in the capital as nothing more than ridiculous , a lot of what the designers showcased on the runway will actually be filling our wardrobes in months to come			2
from the more wearable trends - such as @entity16 and @entity18 's boho vibes - to the downright bizarre looks - like @entity20 's full glitter faces and @entity23 's @entity22 doll inspired looks - @entity14 has compiled the most weird and wonderful trends to emerge from @entity26 fashion week			1

@entity49 and olive maxi dresses also made a comeback and were worn with the tiniest of waistcoats			2
mosaic - encrusted tops , quilted floral jackets , and patchwork leggings rocked the runway , with the occasional injection of leopard - print making a graphic statement			2

flowing silk dresses came slashed to the hip and were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by birth flowers , horoscope signs and stones			0
fur is officially in fashion come autumn , if @entity18 's catwalk is anything to go by - his shaggy @entity76 lamb and shearling in topaz , teal , and pink sent @entity81 into a furry frenzy			0
@entity83 is back , according to @entity16 , where @entity84 sent models down the runway in mosaic - encrusted tops , quilted floral jackets , and patchwork leggings @entity18 stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection inspired by horoscopes @entity92 designers often look to the past for inspiration but it seems that this season , many delved deep into their archives by taking the @entity22 age as their point of reference			1
design duo @entity103 and @entity104 exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their @entity108 show on friday night			0
the relentlessly alluring theme of @entity110 seeped throughout the collection - named @entity111 - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the @entity22 age			1
frills were rife , dominating the collars or lining the dress , and even made their mark on footwear			0
@entity121 blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway , followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter â€™s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette			0

the @entity156 designer and strictly come dancing star embraced gothic glamour in his @entity26 show			0
@entity146 's racy designs were overtly sexual but managed to maintain that sense of sophistication that makes him a red carpet favourite			1
@entity146 was one of many designers to embrace gothic glamour and all things racy in @entity26 this season dominatrix-esque models took to the runway wearing thick chokers , long black gloves and embellished luxe silks			1
@entity172 , both long and short , came with @entity174 cutouts and were worn with thigh - high leggings , ensuring the @entity146 woman garners attention for all the right reasons			1
@entity179 , a firm favourite of @entity181 , also embraced the bondage theme by sending models down the runway wearing full fishnet bodysuits with just a thong underneath			0
the @entity189 designer 's catwalk was awash with masks , collars and corsets in leather and croc , with some faces completely covered in black paint			2
meanwhile , @entity20 the queen of quirky footwear - incorporated the bondage theme into her show designs with thigh - high strappy sandals with leather detailing , as well as bags emblazoned with the words ' @entity204 '			2

for her autumn / winter 2015 line , entitled ' @entity252 '			0
@entity242 was influenced by @entity254 's motorways , with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by @entity259 speed limits			0
motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection , with bags stamped with traffic signs like ' road works ahead ' and ' no u-turn			0
' perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the @entity273 clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars			0

behind the scenes , the most talented hair and make - up artists in the world work like a well - oiled machine to set the next season 's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it , we 'll be wearing fake freckles , smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make - up at all come next autumn			2
