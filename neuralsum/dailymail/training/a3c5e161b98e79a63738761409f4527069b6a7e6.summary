by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 12 august 2013 a council 's decision to cut down wooden stakes from a play area over fears children might snap them in half has been branded ' utter madness '			1
parents clashed with council leaders after workmen removed the wooden stakes from the @entity14 - themed park which commemorated a famous local battle			1
killjoy health and safety officers ruled the pillars , in @entity18 in @entity19 , were dangerous because children could injure themselves if they climbed up them			1
overreaction : parents accused @entity19 of being ' health and safety zealots ' after advising that stakes ( one of which is circled in red in this picture taken in 2011 ) should be removed from the play area barmy : the council 's view that the stakes posed a risk was ridiculed by one parent who said it was ' utter nonsense ' the stakes were put up in 2011 as part of a revamp of the park , run by @entity42 , with Â£ 50,000 funding for the project coming from landowners @entity19 - the same authority that has now deemed the stakes a risk			1
a @entity19 spokesman said : ' the concern was that the poles were not wide enough in diameter to withstand children swinging on them			2
' the poles were in danger of snapping when children played on them			0
' the play area was installed and run by @entity42			2
the work to cut back the posts was also carried out by them			2
' @entity19 's only involvement was as the landlowner , and in that role we advised the parish council that the poles were not wide enough for their purpose and therefore were a potential danger to children playing there			1
' hacked off : the fence used to have 8ftft spikes on , but was cut down to size by over-zealous council health and safety officials because it was feared a child might hurt themselves father - of - three @entity78 , 45 , from @entity19 , said : ' it 's utter nonsense that these stakes were a health risk			1
' the children would have to shimmy up the poles to reach the spikes and then somehow hurl themselves onto them - it 's ridiculous			0
' the stakes were put up around the play park to commemorate the @entity14 and they were a good learning tool for children while they played in the park			2
' ironically , what we now have is the posts cut down to about waist height but they are more of a hazard with kids tripping over them			0
' when i contacted the council about the removal of the stakes i was told there was a risk of children impaling themselves on them			2
' once again the council have proved themselves to be health and safety zealots			1
' historic : the 8ft tall spikes surrounding the play area were supposed to be a tribute to the pikemen of the @entity14 who fought in the famous nearby @entity113 in 1651 - until council workmen cut them down amateur photographer @entity115 , 77 , from @entity19 , who took pictures of the park when it was unveiled , added : ' i think it is disgusting what the council has done			1
' to take them down is one thing , but now they are using them as posts , it is disrespectful			0
in my opinion , they are not dangerous , it is just health and safety gone mad			0
' the spikes were like a fort for the children to play around , i am sure the children are disappointed about what has happened			0
for the council to just cut them down is madness			0
' the way they have cut the spikes has left them more dangerous than they were before , they are now quite sharp and could catch children who are not concentrating			0
' @entity150 councillor @entity149 also opposed cutting down the display			0
he said : ' i am disappointed that they had to be cut down to two feet high when they were quite splendid and built to resemble the pikemen of the @entity113 in 1651			1
' concerns : officials feared children might , somehow , snap the thick wooden spikes which were standing in @entity18 , in @entity159 's , @entity19 @entity160 today branded a council decision to cut the stakes down as ' barmy			1
' @entity163 , campaign director of the @entity160 , said : ' it 's utterly barmy that @entity19 has forked out so much taxpayers ' cash on revamping the park , potentially only to spend more undoing some of that work			1
' too often health and safety rules are cited as a reason for stopping children from having fun , regardless of whether there are genuine risks			0
' yet , if the spikes pose a danger to children the question has to be asked why they were included in the design in the fist place , let alone erected			0
' but @entity19 earlier defended the decision			2
a spokesman said : ' children and young people were getting onto these spikes and pulling them down			0
some of them were being snapped off			0
' a health and safety inspector thought it was not appropriate and that they should be made safe			1

parents brand council ' health and safety zealots '
stakes were tribute to the pikemen who fought in @entity14 's @entity113 in 1651
@entity42 helped pay for the stakes to be installed in the first place
taxpayers ' group said decision to cut spikes was ' utterly barmy '
@entity42 's health and safety inspector ruled posts ' should be made safe '
removal was carried out by @entity42 after a survey by a @entity19 health and safety inspector
