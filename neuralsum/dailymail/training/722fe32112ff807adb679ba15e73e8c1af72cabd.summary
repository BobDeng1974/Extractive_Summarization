a few thousand of @entity3 ’s top earners contribute more to the taxman than the bottom nine million , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the top 3,000 income tax payers will between them provide around 4.2 per cent of the total government revenue from income tax in this financial year			1
that compares to less than four per cent from the lowest - earning nine million workers			2
tax returns : the very highest earners - just under 3,000 people with a declared income above £ 2.7million - will contribute 4.2 per cent of the total government revenue from income tax in this financial year each of the top 3,000 earners declares an income above £ 2.7million , the figures from @entity20 show			1
some 30million people pay income tax – meaning the contribution from the top 3,000 is the same as the total from around a third of the lowest earners			1
the figures were released by @entity20 to the journalist @entity31 under the @entity32 as part of his investigation into wealth inequality in @entity3			2
they form part of a @entity39 dispatches documentary entitled how @entity40 , which is broadcast tonight			0
the @entity42 said the revelations undermined @entity46 leader @entity45 ’s claim that @entity3 was now a ‘ zero - zero ’ country where the richest pay zero tax and the poorest work on zero hours contracts			1
they pointed out the @entity51 had increased the tax threshold for low earners so many more pay no tax at all			0
a @entity56 source said : ‘ the rich pay more under this government than under @entity46			0
the people who pay zero tax are the millions of low earners who have been taken out of paying income tax altogether due to chancellor @entity63 increasing the tax - free personal allowance			1
‘ this is yet more evidence that because he has no economic plan , @entity45 is not up to the job			0
’ journalist @entity31 ( left ) , who obtained the figures , said they ' blow apart ' the claim by @entity46 leader @entity45 ( right ) that @entity3 is a ' zero zero ' country of ' zero - hours contracts , and zero tax for those at the top ' a @entity46 source said mr @entity45 was talking about the few people and corporations who avoid paying tax			1
the source said : ‘ these figures relate to income tax only , not other taxes like vat which are less progressive			1
' they also reflect how a few at the very top earn many times more than ordinary working people			0
‘ the fact is the @entity42 have given the top 1 per cent of earners a £ 3billion - a - year income tax cut , while ordinary families are paying more in higher vat			1
’ mr @entity31 , editor of @entity91 , said that last year the richest were ‘ shouldering a greater share of the burden than at any time in history ’			0
he added : ‘ this was achieved after the top rate of income tax was reduced from 50p to 45p in april 2013			2
it is now harder than ever for @entity45 to justify bringing back the 50p tax			0
’ the figures show the top 3,000 taxpayers earn around 1.4 per cent of all the income received in the @entity3 but pay three times that proportion of the income tax receipts			1
last year some £ 154billion was collected in income tax			2
the statistics show the top 30,000 earners collect around five per cent of all pay but account for more than 11 per cent of the income tax take			2
@entity111 commissioned for the @entity112 as part of the programme compared the 1million people living in the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in @entity3			0
it found the million poorest were 12 times more likely to be victims of violent crime , and three times more likely to live in fatherless households			0
children attending state schools in the most deprived areas were three times more likely to fail to get five gcse grades at a to c level compared with the richest .			0

just under 3,000 people with a declared income above £ 2.7million
they will contribute 4.2 **%** of total @entity51 income tax revenue
*9million* lowest - paid contribute less than 4 **%** of total income tax take
figures ' blow apart ' @entity45 *'s* claim that @entity3 is ' zero zero ' country
