by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 06:45 est , 29 november 2012 a charity raffle organiser who wrote to @entity3 in the hope that the prime minister could donate a prize has been left baffled after @entity7 sent back a signed picture			1
dementia campaigner @entity9 is not sure that anyone who buys a ticket for his @entity13 raffle will want an autographed photo of the prime minister			1
the 65 - year - old from @entity17 , @entity18 , was initially thrilled when @entity7 agreed to help			1
baffled : @entity9 says that he does n't know what to do with the signed picture of @entity3 offered by @entity7 as a raffle prize but rather than send a dinner set or a hamper - the sort of prizes usually on offer as part of the prize draw - he received what he now says will be his ' booby prize '			1
@entity9 , who runs the monthly dementia cafe with his 58 - year - old wife @entity31 , said : ' i was honestly shocked when i opened the package and it was a picture of mr @entity3			1
' the gifts we usually have in our raffles are useful prizes - so for the @entity39 raffle we 've got a tv , a hamper , a three - piece bistro set , a microwave , a trip to @entity46 hotel and spa , which would be a great gift for a carer			1
' alongside that , this picture of @entity3 looks a bit like a joke			2
' i can not think of anyone who would actually want it			0
' @entity9 said the one pound - a - go raffle , which usually attracts around 60 people , aims to help carers and people with dementia , a condition that can affect memory , understanding and speech			1
he explained that he wrote to the prime minister around six weeks ago inviting mr @entity3 to attend his @entity39 raffle			1
he received a reply on headed notepaper saying due to commitments , the pm would not be able to attend - but added : ' if you have another raffle , please contact us directly and with reasonable notive we may be able to provide a prize			1
' ' @entity73 ' : @entity9 is not sure what to do with the picture of @entity3 , pictured excited @entity9 wrote back telling them the next raffle was a special @entity39 event on december 1 - and received the signed picture along with a letter that read : ' the prime minister is delighted to provide the enclosed signed photograph which comes with his good wishes for your fundraising			1
' @entity9 , who worked in newspaper distribution and with the @entity87 before retiring last year , added : ' i was a bit deflated			2
i do n't know what i was expecting him to send , whether it would be a hamper or whatever , but there seems to be some crossed wires somewhere			0
' we make sure all the raffle prizes are something that people who attend the event can use			0
i think that message might have got a bit lost at @entity7 , so they sent this picture			2
' so it 's a bit of a bizarre prize			0
i do n't really know what to do about it			0
' i 'd told everyone and they were all really excited to see what @entity7 sent up , so i do n't know what they 're going to say			2
' usually before the raffle i 'll give a bit of a speech and get everyone excited about the prizes we 've got on offer , but i honestly do n't know what i 'm going to say about this			2
' i 've put it in a frame because it did n't come in one			0
we 're going to have to put our heads together and see what we can make of it			0
' @entity9 , who worked for the @entity87 following his mother @entity130 ' battle with the condition , said : ' i would n't buy it			0
i think it 's a bit presumptuous as a raffle prize			0
' a @entity7 spokesman said the gift was ' intended as a gesture of good will ' .			0

@entity9 , 65 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , wrote to @entity3 asking for a prize for his @entity39 fundraiser raffle
he was excited when @entity7 offered to help but left *disappointed* by the prize he received
