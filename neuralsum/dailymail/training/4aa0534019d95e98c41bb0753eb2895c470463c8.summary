sales of caffeine and sugar - packed energy drinks should be restricted as they ‘ pose a danger ’ to children and young people , a study has suggested			1
more than two thirds of 10 to 18 - year - olds consume drinks like @entity14 and @entity15 and their popularity is growing , research by the @entity9 ’s @entity8 for @entity10 found			1
but the study warned children and teenagers who used highly - caffeinated drinks were at risk of ‘ potentially harmful adverse and developmental effects ’			1
lead author dr @entity24 called for restrictions to be put in place to limit the sale of energy drinks to children			1
the study , which examined existing research , said : ‘ the full impact of the rise in popularity of energy drinks has not yet been quantified , but the aggressive marketing of energy drinks targeted at young people combined with limited and varied regulation have created an environment where energy drinks could pose a significant threat to public health			0
’ it added : ‘ as energy drink sales are rarely regulated by age and there is a proven negative effect of caffeine on children , there is the potential for a significant public health problem in future			1
’ large amounts of caffeine can cause heart palpitations , fits and even death , as well as raising the risk of type 2 diabetes			2

more than two thirds of 10 to 18 - year - olds consume drinks like @entity14 and @entity15 , the study found energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly , unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee , the @entity86 in @entity10 study said			1
more than seven in 10 young people who drink energy drinks mix them with alcohol but this is particularly dangerous because the energising effect means drinkers are unaware of how drunk they are getting			2
studies have shown people who mix the drinks are more likely to drink - drive , fight and take sexual risks			0
several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks , although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link			0
@entity111 , director general of the @entity113 @entity112 , said the study did not take ‘ into account the conclusions of other scientific articles ’			0
he added : ‘ several of the policy recommendations it makes are already well established through the @entity121 ’s voluntary code and @entity123 regulation			0
’ recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day – equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee			0
a standard 250ml can of @entity14 contains 80mg of caffeine and 27.5g of sugar ( nearly seven teaspoons ) , while a 500ml can of monster contains 160mg of caffeine and 55g – or nearly 14 teaspoons - of sugar			1
some @entity10 countries like @entity135 and @entity136 have total bans on energy drinks , while others like @entity140 have restrictions on sales to under - 15s			2
they are banned from many schools in @entity113 and some retailers have their own policies on sales to under - 16s , but there is no law preventing their sale to children			2
