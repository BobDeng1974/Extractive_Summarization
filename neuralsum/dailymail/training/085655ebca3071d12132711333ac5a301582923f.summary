by @entity0 published : 09:44 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 01:50 est , 18 september 2012 relieved : former @entity2 worker @entity1 cried as she left court where she was spared jail for smuggling cigarettes an air hostess whose career crash landed after being unmasked as a cigarette smuggler wept as she walked free from court today			1
former @entity2 stewardess @entity1 , 26 , started the racket with cabin crew colleague @entity11 so they could sell the cut - price cigarettes on to family and friends for extra cash			1
but @entity17 was intercepted at @entity18 from a @entity20 flight while trying to sneak 7,800 @entity22 cigarettes into the @entity23 hidden in her luggage			1
@entity11 , 28 , was stopped five minutes later and was found to have 6,000 duty free cigarettes			1
between them they avoided paying more than £ 3,500 in tax			2
the pair were not on duty at the time they were arrested and were only ordered before the court because they worked within the aviation industry			1
as a result , both have decided to quit their jobs following disciplinary proceedings			1
today at @entity38 , @entity17 and @entity11 , both from @entity40 , admitted evading tax duty			1
they were caught on august 20 after @entity17 arrived back in the @entity23 after visiting @entity11 in @entity43 where he lives four days a week			1
at 11.30pm she was stopped whilst in the green channel and was found to have 2,000 @entity22 filter cigarettes in her bag			1
another of her bags was recovered from the luggage pick up point and was found to have many more cigarettes inside			2
prosecutor miss @entity53 said : ' @entity1 , due to an accident had been prevented from working at @entity2 for four months and it was a last - minute decision to purchase the cigarettes after she overheard people talking about buying cigarettes			1
' she thought it was a good idea to top up her money and withdrew the cash			0
it was her intention to sell the cigarettes to friends , she knew she had brought in more than she was allowed			2
' she had brought in cigarettes on a previous trip to @entity67 five years ago			0
' five minutes later @entity11 was also intercepted			1
@entity11 knew he was carrying far in excess of what he was allowed			1
' they had hired a car to transport the cigarettes and packed them in their suitcases with each other present with the intention to sell to their friends and family			0
conspirators : @entity17 ( left ) and co-worker @entity11 ( right ) admitted smuggling 13,800 cigarettes through customs at @entity18 ' clearly this was a joint enterprise , @entity1 bought the cigarettes with her own money and they were both going to supply cigarettes together with the intention to sell to family and friends			1
' they both have no previous convictions , both are cabin crew workers and worked for @entity2 and would have had full knowledge of allowance			1
it was a breach of their position of trust			0
' the court heard the approximate duty avoided in total by the pair was £ 3,500.26			1
@entity17 and @entity11 were each given a two year conditional discharge and were each ordered to pay £ 85 costs			2
@entity105 , defending @entity11 , said : ' this was not a situation of breach of trust			2
at no stage did @entity11 report at the airport to be a member of @entity2 and he came through the normal channels			1
' he was not trying to get around any security measures			0
had they been civilians when they went through the airport they would have been dealt with by way of warning			0
' as a result of the prosecution , they have had significant punishment which is the loss of their employment			0
@entity11 has made a stupid mistake and is now paying for it having been punished already with the loss of his job			2
' punishment : both quit their jobs with @entity2 because they breached trust that comes with their air stewarding roles for @entity132 , mr @entity131 said : ' she has suffered with the loss of employment and she was summoned to @entity135 for disciplinary action and has suffered from that			1
' she is deeply ashamed of what she has done			0
all that she has known was the airline industry and from the age of 18 she worked hard to progress and all this has gone			0
' she will not be able to work in the airline industry again and it is a source of deep regret			0
' she is full of remorse of what happened and if she could would turn the clock back			0
had they not been employed by the airline they would not have been prosecuted			0
' district judge @entity153 told them : ' you have both lost a lot as a result of these actions - but are people who should be valued by any future employers			0
' i am prepared to accept this was an isolated act			0
on your part it was an attempt to nearly raise funds on your own behalf			0
' nevertheless it is a serious matter , it is not a victimless crime , people who avoid revenue payment make the rest of us suffer			0
' duty laws introduced last year restrict @entity177 holidaymakers to 800 cigarettes and one kilogram of rolling tobacco per person			2
a spokesman for @entity182 , the enforcement arm of the @entity184 said : ' @entity186 smuggling is serious and increases the tax burden on everyone else			2
revenue from cigarettes and tobacco helps fund public services			0
' tobacco smugglers are tracked by @entity182 and @entity194 , and repeat offenders will be prosecuted			0

@entity1 stopped at @entity18
she was forced to face court *alongside* colleague @entity11 for smuggling cigarettes
