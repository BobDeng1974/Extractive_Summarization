country rock star @entity0 has been duped into retweeting a picture of paedophile @entity2 by a prankster who claimed it was his grandad			1
twitter user ' @entity6 imo ' sent the singer , best known for his number one single ' @entity9 ' , a picture of @entity11 and wrote : ' @entity12 , it 's my @entity13 's birthday today and he 's a huge fan			1
he 'd love a @entity15 ! ' the @entity17 singer , 53 , who is father to global pop sensation and wild child , @entity20 , sent the message on to his 1.75million followers			1
@entity2 abused at least 500 victims , with the youngest allegedly just two years old , the @entity39 has reported			2
the most common age group for his victims was 13 to 15			0
he also targeted hospital patients , ranging from five - year - old children to 75 - year - old pensioners , including men , women , boys and girls			0
he may have even committed sex acts on dead bodies in the mortuary at @entity54			0
@entity55 , 68 , was tricked into sharing this photo of serial killers @entity58 and @entity59 after he was sent a message by a follower saying the tycoon had been a ' big inspiration ' to his parents the team who run the @entity69 @entity17 star 's @entity68 feed shared the message , but quickly removed it after realising the mistake			1
the serial killers ( right ) murdered young women and girls between the 1960s and 1980s five hours after he shared the post , the tycoon said it was evidence you should not be ' nice and trusting ' the concept of ' @entity82 ' is basically sending a person a link to something that appears interesting or relevant			1
but it is actually just a disguise - when the person clicks on the link , it takes them to @entity92 's uber - cheesey music video for his 1987 song ' @entity86			0
' the clip managed to find its way into pop culture , with celebrities and even politicians ' @entity82 ' people			0
@entity55 was on the receiving end of a similar joke earlier this week , when he retweeted a picture of infamous serial murderers @entity58 and @entity59			1
the @entity17 business magnate was contacted on social media by @entity106 , who sent him a message saying his late parents had always considered him a ' big inspiration ' - but included an image of the convicted rapists and murderers instead			2
the message was quickly shared on the multi-millionaire 's feed by his media team to his 2.7m followers but was taken down 40 minutes later after they realised their embarrassing mistake			0
but hours later the tycoon responded , saying he may sue the culprit .			2
