@entity0 yesterday accused archbishop of canterbury @entity1 of ‘ talking down ’ the @entity3			1
in unusually direct criticism , the prime minister described the @entity7 ’s views on the @entity3 as ‘ outdated ’ and ‘ condescending ’			1
his comments follow a recent article by the archbishop in which he said ‘ entire cities are being cast aside and left to their own devices ’			2
@entity0 has called archbishop @entity1 's views on the @entity14 ' outdated ' and ' condescending ' after a @entity7 report said the region is heading backwards while the @entity17 surges ahead archbishop @entity1 also claimed that most of the country outside @entity20 and the @entity21 had been left ‘ abandoned and hopeless ’ , watching the wealth of the capital grow while they are trapped in a ‘ vicious circle of decline ’			1
mr @entity0 has now hit back , telling @entity27 the @entity7 was guilty of ‘ just painting a picture that everything in the @entity3 is somehow going in the wrong direction ’			1
@entity0 pointed to @entity31 as a revived city where unemployment rates have been lower in recent years than in @entity20 he said : ‘ where i do n’t agree with some of the things the @entity7 said is i think there was an element of talking down the performance of some of our cities , including cities like @entity31 , which in recent years have seen something of a revival			1
‘ when you look at the transport investment in @entity31 , when you look at some of the infrastructure that ’s being put in , you look at some of the great buildings that are going up , the growth in jobs , the fact that you ’ve got a city council that ’s working incredibly closely with the government over issues like the ‘ ‘ northern powerhouse ’ ’ ... ‘ i thought the @entity7 report rather outdated			1
i found it a bit condescending when it came to our great @entity62 cities			2
i do n’t think it was really up to date on what is happening			0
' i accept there are still regional disparities that we need to deal with but i do n’t think we deal with them by just painting a picture that everything in the @entity3 is somehow going in the wrong direction and everything in the @entity17 is going in the right direction			2
’ mr @entity0 pointed out that employment rates in @entity31 had been higher in recent years than those in @entity20			0
he added : ‘ if you talk to the @entity80 or the chambers of commerce in cities like @entity84 and @entity85 , i would rather hope they would say the same thing			0
’ the prime minister also defended the benefit cap which he has pledged to cut to £ 23,000 after the election if the @entity91 win			0
he said : ‘ i think it is right to say you should n’t get more [ if you are ] out of work than a family that is in work			0
' otherwise we send a totally perverse signal that somehow it ’s better off to spend a life on benefits when you can work			0

@entity7 report said @entity3 's cities left ' abandoned and hopeless '
said places were trapped into ' circle of decline ' as @entity17 gets wealthier
@entity0 said ' condescending ' report was out of date with northern revival
