@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity2 is the ' strong figurehead ' @entity5 need and insists the @entity6 can still win the title this season			1
@entity5 are unbeaten since november 2 and have won seven of their last nine league matches ahead of their trip to the @entity13 on @entity14			1
that run has seen @entity17 's side climb to third and @entity0 , who played 467 times for @entity5 , believes the @entity19 is starting to make his mark at @entity21			1
@entity2 is a ' strong figurehead ' for @entity5 , according to @entity1 manager @entity0 @entity0 will lead his @entity1 team into battle with @entity5 at the @entity13 on @entity14 @entity5 have rediscovered their winning touch and are unbeaten in the @entity26 since november 2 @entity5 are 10 points behind leaders @entity29 and seven behind second - placed @entity30 in the table ' suddenly he seems to be the right figurehead for the club , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's the guy you sense they need given last year was a time of transition for them			0
' they 're still going through that process to a certain extent so they need a strong person at the head of the club and he certainly gives that impression			0
' no manager has used more players in the @entity26 this season than @entity17 , who has handed appearances to 26 of his first - team squad so far			2
despite @entity5 's excellent run of results , their performances have not always been convincing and @entity0 believes @entity17 is still working out his best team and style of play			1
' it 's still early days , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity17 seems to talk about his philosophy a lot and any philosophy you have as a manager takes time to instil			0
@entity17 arrived at @entity21 in the summer and is assisted by club legend @entity64 @entity1 beat @entity65 2 - 0 on sunday and defeated @entity5 on home turf last season nov 8 @entity68 ( @entity69 ) 1 - 0 nov 22 @entity70 ( a ) 2 - 1 nov 29 @entity71 ( @entity69 ) 3 - 0 dec 2 @entity1 ( @entity69 ) 2 - 1 dec 8 @entity72 ( a ) 2 - 1 dec 14 @entity73 ( @entity69 ) 3 - 0 dec 20 @entity74 ( a ) 1 - 1 dec 26 @entity75 ( @entity69 ) 3 - 1 dec 28 @entity76 ( a ) 0 - 0 ' he 's changed personnel , given guys who were out in the cold another opportunity , changing shape and formations			1
' that takes time , it takes time for the players to take information on board and perhaps he 's clearing his mind for the way he wants to go long - term , only time will tell			0
' @entity5 are 10 points behind league leaders @entity29 and seven back on @entity30 but @entity0 feels his opponents on thursday are still in contention to become champions in may			1
' i think they are title contenders , they may have given themselves too much to do - they 're 10 points back at the moment and there are very strong teams ahead of them , ' @entity0 said			2
' they 're coming into a run of form now which will encourage them and that 's what they need to do , they ca n't afford to have too many more slip ups			0
' hopefully we 'll be able to overcome them and that will be four defeats - historically you ca n't afford more than six to seven			0
if you have that many defeats it 's almost impossible to win the @entity26			0
' they 'll be aware of that but they have the players to go on an extended run as they 're doing at the moment			0
' former @entity5 striker @entity123 celebrates scoring in the 2 - 0 win over @entity65 @entity5 were unable to find a way through @entity76 's stubborn resistance on sunday afternoon , drawing 0 - 0 @entity127 was on target as @entity5 beat @entity1 2 - 1 at @entity21 last month @entity129 ( left ) scored the winner as @entity1 beat @entity5 , led by @entity131 , in february @entity132 wins over @entity133 and @entity65 have pushed @entity1 up to 11th in the table , six points behind sixth place			1
@entity0 is delighted with the @entity138 ' progress and wants to add @entity5 to an impressive list of scalps this season that already includes @entity30 , @entity76 , @entity70 and @entity133			2
' 2014 has been great for us - i think we 've picked up more points in the calendar year than any other @entity1 team in the @entity26 , ' @entity0 said			1
' but @entity5 are a good team , it 's up to us to ask questions of them			2
' our record against the top teams has been good and they 'll know they will be in for a tough game			0
' it 's a difficult place to come if you 're a top team and we need to make sure that continues			0
