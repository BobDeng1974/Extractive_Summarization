' @entity51 - born mr @entity14 , who has lived in @entity5 for seven years and been married for 15 years , had been on a bar crawl with six friends on february 24			1
he and one of the group ended up in @entity57 bar in the @entity59 hotel at 11pm , where he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman standing at the bar , a clerk with a recruitment company			0
she was out with her 27 - year - old boyfriend and a friend and complained she had felt someone groping her between her legs - although she admitted she did not see who did it and her own friend claimed mr @entity14 was innocent			1
mr @entity14 said : ' she insisted it was me because she turned around and i was standing there			2
i know myself and i would never do that			0
