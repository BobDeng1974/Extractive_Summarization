@entity0 smokes ! researchers found the bombardier beetle mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' a beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci - fi film - or the stuff of nightmares			1
but researchers have discovered the @entity15 beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal ' reaction chamber ' in its stomach			1
when threatened , the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul - smelling liquid from its rear , complete with ' gun smoke '			1
it can even precisely aim the nozzle at the attacker			2
this behaviour has been caught on camera by @entity30 and her colleagues at the @entity32			0
many beetles secrete foul - smelling or bad - tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators , but bombardier beetles take it a step further			1
when threatened , they combine chemicals in an explosive chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray			1
assistant professor @entity30 , from the @entity46 at the university , has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid - fire capabilities			1
' understanding how these beetles produce - and survive - repetitive explosions could provide new design principles for technologies such as blast mitigation and propulsion , ' she said			2
the study was led by doctoral student @entity64 and @entity65 in the @entity66 at @entity67 ( @entity67 ) in @entity68			0
@entity64 and @entity69 teamed up with professor @entity30 to study the anatomy of the beetle 's reaction chamber , which is constructed of cuticle , a composite of chitin , proteins and waxes			1
the material , which also makes up the exoskeleton of insects , protects the beetle from the toxic chemicals , high temperatures and high pressures during explosions			2
a real hot shot ! the research , including video footage ( shown above ) not only reveals the beetle 's firing apparatus in never - before - seen detail , but also solves a long - standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid - fire capabilities the mechanism of the bombardier beetle 's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies , relying on external observations , could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun			1
@entity104 bombardier beetles can accurately hit targets in any direction			0
researchers at @entity108 snapped another type of @entity110 , @entity112 insignis ' attack in 1999 , to reveal they use the explosive defensive mechanism to buy time when they are under attack			0
the beetle is quite vulnerable on the ground because unlike most insects such as bees and flies , it ca n't take off instantly			2
this means that the slow process of unfurling its wings could cost the insect its life if under attack from ants , for example			0
so it attacks its attackers in turn , giving it time to get airborne			0
the spray itself contains p - benzoquinones - compounds known for their irritant properties			2
the chemicals are stored separately in the creature 's abdomen and then combine explosively , explaining why they are ejected at such high speed and at 100 @entity142 ' twenty - five years ago , a team of scientists from @entity108 and @entity67 discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses , ' assistant professor @entity30 said			1
' what was n't known is what causes each discharge to be pulsed , like a machine gun			1
' previous researchers suggested that the pulses were caused by muscle contractions or by a fluttering of the exit duct during the explosions			2
' using enzymes that digest muscle and fat , the researchers cleaned the reaction chamber , which enabled them to examine it under a microscope			0
while studying the shape of the reaction chamber , they noticed that some regions of the chamber wall were thin and not as strong as others , and that one region near the mixing valve looked particularly thin			0
they predicted that this thin cuticle would be displaced by the force of the reactions in such a way that it would impinge upon the valve - temporarily shutting off the flow of reactants			0
to investigate this hypothesis , the team directly observed the internal dynamics of spray pulsation in live @entity184 elongatulus beetles , a type of bombardier beetle , which is found throughout southern @entity187			0
of 500 beetles , the researchers were able to record 30 discharges from 14 individuals			0
this was enough to provide high - definition , high - speed video of what happens inside a bombardier beetle 's reaction chamber when it goes off			1
all guns blazing : ' twenty - five years ago , a team of scientists from @entity108 and @entity67 discovered that each blast from the bombardier beetle is actually a series of extraordinarily fast micro-pulses , ' assistant professor @entity30 said , which led to the machine gun analogy			1
a stock image of a machine gun is shown it turns out the pulses are generated in a passive way , not through an active process involving muscle contraction , as previously thought			1
as the chemicals pass through a valve into the reaction chamber , they mix with enzymes and explosively liberate oxygen gas , water vapor and heat , propelling a hot , noxious spray down the nozzle and out the exit pore			1
each explosion inside the chamber forces a highly elastic region of the chamber wall - the thin cuticular area @entity30 found in her earlier dissections - to expand and impinge on the valve that separates the two chambers , temporarily cutting off the flow of reactants and resulting in a pulsed delivery			2
' it turns out the expansion membrane of the reaction chamber acts as a passive closure mechanism , which is something that had not been described or even predicted before this study , ' professor @entity30 said			0
' we also discovered that the chamber 's anatomy varies between female and male beetles			0
' while it is still not completely clear why it might be beneficial to the beetle to have a pulsed delivery , she suspects that dividing the spray into very short , rapid pulses allows the beetle to sustain the energy of the blast and its small body size at the same time			2
' by having a pulsed delivery , these small beetles produce a relatively large amount of defensive spray , which they can aim precisely and with great force and speed , ' she said			0
' this is truly one of the most remarkable and elegant defensive mechanisms documented to date			0
' when threatened , the bombardier beetle repeatedly fires streams of liquid from its rear , complete with ' gun smoke '			1
the expulsion of fluid is shown in the images above , which come from a 1999 study that found another bug , @entity271 , uses its weapon to ' buy time ' when under attack because it ca n't fly away			0

@entity15 beetle mimics machine gun using chemicals in its stomach
as chemicals pass into the abdomen they mix with enzymes and explode
each explosion causes the foul - smelling liquid to be forced from its rear
it ' pulses ' repeatedly from the beetle 's rear - and the bug can even aim
