by @entity0 @entity1 is keeping a hot secret and it 's their version of the popular @entity5 hot sauce which they 've introduced as a limited edition product only available online at their ' @entity9			1
' as sriracha maker @entity11 fights with officials in @entity13 , @entity14 over ' spicy air ' emanating from the factory , competitors are taking an opportunity to create their own version of the chili sauce while the original company fights with their factory 's local community			1
sriracha owner @entity11 claims he 's in @entity13 to stay and has no plans of moving his $ 40 million 655,000 - square - foot corporate headquarters but @entity5 has been disappearing from supermarket shelves as the company has had to limit production			1
@entity5 ( left ) has a patented appearance but the name @entity5 can be used by @entity1 ( right ) because the word @entity5 is derived from a place in @entity33 the @entity11 factory , maker of @entity5 hot chili sauce , has recieved from complaints from residents in @entity13 , @entity14 who say the factory makes the air too spicy @entity41 says the legal battle over the factory he calls his ' loved one ' reminds him of living in @entity46 , from which he escaped 35 years ago			1
' today , i feel almost the same			0
even now , we live in [ the ] @entity49 , and my feeling , the government , not a big difference , ' he says			0
@entity53 reports that companies like @entity1 have decided to create their own product at a time when @entity11 is at its weakest			1
@entity57 reports that @entity1 has been hush - hush about their new sauce because the product is still in development and they are n't ready for the big reveal			0
currently one can purchase the product online at the @entity64 for $ 4.99 for a 15 ounce bottle , about twice the price of the original sauce but they 've done almost nothing to publicize the sauce			0
owner of @entity41 says that @entity5 and his factory are here to stay when @entity74 asked @entity5 why they are keeping their new product on the down low , they replied , ' @entity77 is a limited edition product , currently only available through the @entity64			2
as @entity1 develops new products and innovations , occasionally they are shared with fans through the @entity64			0
' ' @entity84 is made with red peppers and has the slightly sweet and garlicky taste of a traditional @entity5 with the signature @entity1 balance of vinegar , ' they added , while @entity1 's response does n't answer the question of why they are n't making the new sauce readily available , rumor is that @entity1 is n't happy with the product or packaging yet			2
@entity1 is n't the first to copy the chili sauce and it probably wont be the last			0
@entity53 reports that @entity99 sells a version of the sauce and @entity102 has @entity5 flavored @entity103 patented the look of his product characterized by a clear bottle and a green top however , he could n't trademark the name because it 's derived from a city in @entity111 first built his factory because @entity5 was in such high demand and now that the demand is high but he 's had to limit his own productions , it 's the perfect time for competators to swoop in and attract buyers .			2

@entity1 *quietly* introduced a version of @entity5 which is available online at their ' @entity9 '
a rise in demand for @entity5 from those who fear it will disappear from shelves is *inspiring* competitors to create their own version
fans of @entity5 fear a *shortage* of their favorite chili paste as @entity11 fights with locals from @entity13 over the air coming from their factory
