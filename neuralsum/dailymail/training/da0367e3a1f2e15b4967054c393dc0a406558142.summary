by @entity0 high - speed cameras have revealed how cats can manage to land safely even when falling from a great height			1
cats have long been renowned for their ability to land on their feet , and now a new documentary will show exactly how the pets manage to hold onto their nine lives as they twist and turn on their way to the ground			1
images filmed on a high - speed camera show how a cat 's body will perform four manoeuvres in mid-air , including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute			1
safety : images filmed on a high - speed camera show how a cat 's body performs four manoeuvres in mid-air , including stretching out their legs to transform their bodies into a living parachute as part of new @entity33 documentary @entity31 of @entity4 , the animals were filmed in a studio as they were dropped from a height of around 10ft slowed down , the footage shows how a cat will first straighten up so its body will eventually be parallel to the ground , turning on its head and then its tail			1
it will then spread all four limbs to slow its fall and as it nears the ground , the cat will extend its claws to give it a good grip when it lands			1
finally the tumbling animal will flex its back to minimise any shock from landing			1
sir @entity53 , emeritus professor of ethology at @entity55 and president of the @entity57 , said that a cat 's legs give the animal air resistance which enables its body to spin around faster			1
' they stick out their legs so that provides greater inertia , so that when they turn the body the bits that are sticking out do n’t turn so rapidly , ' he told the @entity66			1
' then they repeat that with the other set of legs			2
' instinct : by the time a kitten is seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to survive a fall , known as the ' righting reflex ' according to the documentary , which airs tomorrow night , by the time a kitten is seven weeks old it will have already developed the instinct needed to survive a fall , known as the ' righting reflex '			1
sir @entity53 said that one of his cats , @entity82 , had fallen behind a wardrobe when she was a kitten , breaking her pelvis because the space behind the cupboard was too small for her to fully turn			0
' she is fine now , but it was a clear demonstration of how if you prevent the animal turning and sticking its legs out , it can not do the whole operation , ' he said			1
in 2012 it was reported that a one - year - old cat called @entity98 had fallen 200ft from a nineteen storey window in @entity100 , @entity101 , with just a bruised chest			1
and a 1987 study of 132 cats taken to a vet in @entity106 after falling from high - rise buildings revealed that 90 percent of them survived and one 37 percent required emergency treatment to save their lives			1
one animal which fell 32 storeys survived with a chipped tooth and a collapsed lung , and was allowed to go home after just 48 hours			2
using new filming techniques to show cats as many of their owners will never have seen them before , the documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind @entity126 and the feline friend who acts as his guide			1
one cat who features in the show is @entity131 , who turned up on @entity133 ’s doorstep unexpectedly 16 years ago			2
remarkable tails : the documentary also reveals remarkable stories including how one cat saved a couple from a gas explosion and the surprising relationship between a blind @entity126 and the feline friend who acts as his guide @entity131 ’s acute sense of smell prevented a potentially fatal accident for @entity133 and her husband one night in 2011			1
' i ’d done dinner , my husband had gone up to bed			0
i ’d cleaned the cooker and then went up to bed , ' said mrs @entity133			0
however , she had accidentally left one of the gas rings on and asleep upstairs , neither she nor her husband could smell the leaking gas			0
the pilot light on @entity133 ’s central heating was due to switch on soon , and that would ignite the gas			0
but as cats have a sense of smell 30 times better than that of a human , to @entity131 the smell of gas was intense and dangerous			0
' at about 1.30am he came on the bed , patted my face and i pushed him away , ' said mrs @entity133			0
' an hour and a half later he came back , he was much more insistent			2
he came back and patted my face with one little claw			2
then i knew there was something wrong			0
i could smell something unpleasant ; it literally filled the whole house			0
he could have literally just walked out the cat flap outside , but he did n’t			2
if he had n’t have woken me up , it would have just gone kaboom			0
i ’m really proud of him , he is my hero			0
' the programme also tells the surprising story of the relationship between a blind dog , 14 - year - old @entity182 , and his best friend , a cat called @entity186			1
@entity187 had been thrown against a wall as a puppy , causing his blindness , but @entity186 has been able to act as his guide cat			0
' @entity192 is much more confident when @entity186 is around , ' said owner @entity193			0
' he relies on him to avoid bumping into things			0
often when they ’re out , they ’re nose to tail			0
@entity186 in the lead and @entity192 following him			0
' secret life of @entity4 will be broadcast on @entity33 at 9pm on monday june 2 .			2
