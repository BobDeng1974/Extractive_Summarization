@entity7 company @entity6 and its futuristic jet pack program is expected to be listed on the @entity9 within months and could be selling their flying machines commercially soon			1
ceo @entity12 admits ' it certainly is very exciting , this is going to change aviation forever '			0
they are building the flying equipment for both personal and professional use , with military use also on the agenda			2
however , it 's in the area of disaster recovery , where @entity21 is particularly determined to make an impact			2
already , they say , that there has been strong interest in the @entity48 , across @entity49 and the @entity50			1
while the public listing is likely in @entity53 , most domestic emergency services told @entity54 that they remain non-committal when they assessing the invention against current operational requirements			1
however , one did leave the door slightly ajar , conceding that they are always looking to take advantage of new technology			0
the @entity21 runs on twin ducted fans , not a jet engine , like previous incarnations the jetpack is predominantly carbon fibre and weighs 180 kilograms the jetpack can reach speeds of 74km per hour and rise to an altitude of 250 metres inside a minute ' the first target is the area of first responder , such as fire - fighting , police , ambulance , any emergency service really			1

the price tag of a @entity21 jetpack will range in price from $ 150,000 to $ 250,000 , depending on whether it is the ( primary ) manned version or unmanned			2
@entity21 's first focus will be on the professional market before providing more for personal use the predominantly carbon fibre pack does not use a jet engine ; it has twin - ducted fans to generate lift , runs on 2 - stroke fuel , just like your lawnmower or small motorbike ' we are making them a lot cheaper to run and we can get into a lot smaller spaces , ' mr @entity12 added			1
