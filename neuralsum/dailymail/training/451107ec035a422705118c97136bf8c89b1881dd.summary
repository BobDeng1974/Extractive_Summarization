the jihadist brothers behind the @entity2 massacre , @entity3 and @entity4 , experienced the trauma of finding their mother ’s body after she ’d committed suicide when they were 10 and 12 years old , according to a children ’s worker			1
in the 1990s volunteer @entity11 worked with deprived children in the area of @entity15 that the brothers lived in and often involved them in activities			1
she said she adored both boys			1
on one occasion she took them to @entity21 and described how @entity3 , the younger of the two , was spell - bound by @entity23			1
@entity3 was naughtier and occasionally ‘ turbulent ’ , she told eco website @entity29 , according to @entity30			1
and @entity4 tended to take his lead , despite being older			1
despite @entity3 ’s troublesome side , @entity11 grew enormously fond of him			1
she said : ‘ i adored that child			2
you only had to sweet talk him and take him in your arms and he would calm down			0
i found him quite touching – under the spell of @entity23 and other @entity39 characters , like all children			2
’ the brothers , who were inseparable , found their mother , who was pregnant at the time with a sixth child , dead in their flat when they came home from school for lunch one day			1
@entity11 added : ‘ a few months after the trip to @entity49 came back from school , accompanied , as ever , by his older brother			2
they found their mother lying dead in the centre of the flat			1
dead from what cause ? she had taken too many pills			0
most people assumed it was suicide			0
’ the two brothers were filmed by eyewitnesses in a @entity15 street after they 'd slaughtered several members of the @entity2 editorial team in cold blood both brothers behind the @entity2 massacre have been buried in unmarked graves			2
@entity68 was interred just before midnight in a cemetery in @entity70 , a suburb in north west @entity15 , a day after his older brother @entity4 was buried in the northeastern city of @entity74			1
@entity3 's family , including his widow , kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a ' pilgrimage site ' for @entity81			1
the mayor of @entity70 , where the younger @entity4 brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead , but said he had no legal means to block it			1
@entity88 ’s widow had asked for both brothers to be buried in the cemetery at @entity70 , but the local mayor @entity91 blocked the request since @entity93 , the older brother , was not a resident of the area			2
he added : ' i do n't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics			0
i do n't want a place that promotes hate			0
' he was buried last night , in the most discrete , anonymous way possible			0
' but speaking on @entity104 , mr @entity103 said he was forced to allow the burial by the government , which enforced a @entity108 law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence			0
there are no current plans to bury @entity114 , who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in @entity15 - before he was killed by police on january 9			0
two years later , in 1994 , the brothers were sent to an orphanage in @entity121 with a their younger brother and older sister			2
while there @entity3 developed into a promising footballer and @entity4 was remembered as being ‘ civilised and respectful ’ , according to a former classmate , ‘ @entity126 ’			1
he told website @entity128 and @entity130 newspaper @entity129 : ‘ the @entity4 brothers were " respected " , because they could " handle themselves "			1
@entity3 was very good with his fists but , above all , he was a bit of a lad			1
he was a fan of [ the comedian and actor ] @entity138 and football ... he was funny and regarded himself as a good looker			0
he was a fantastic dancer at 15 and played football as easily as he breathed			0
he could have made a career of it			0
’ but he added that the school was very violent , with some teachers plainly scared of the children			0
he remains convinced that the @entity2 massacre , which saw several members of the magazine murdered , along with two policeman – and the brothers die in a shootout with police at the ages of 32 and 34 - would never have happened if they ’d be supported more			0
‘ they must have been brainwashed , ’ he said			0
the brothers are thought to have been trained by @entity157 in @entity158 - and carried out the attack on the @entity2 magazine to ' avenge the @entity161 '			0
the magazine was famous for poking fun at @entity81 , along with other religions			0
@entity68 was buried in an unmarked grave in @entity70 , a suburb in north - west @entity15 , on saturday night , a day after his older brother , @entity4 , was buried in the northeastern city of @entity74			2
@entity3 's family , including his widow , kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a ' pilgrimage site ' for @entity81			1
the mayor of @entity70 , where the younger @entity4 brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead , but said he had no legal means to block it .			2
