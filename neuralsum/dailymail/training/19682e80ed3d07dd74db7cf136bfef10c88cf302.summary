@entity0 has lent his support to six young people in @entity3 who 've been arrested by government authorities for creating their own version of video for the hitmaker 's number one song @entity7			1
the video titled @entity7 in @entity10 features them dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world			2
but after the video hit @entity20 and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of @entity24 news sites like the @entity25 , authorities hunted down its stars , interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail			1
sad : these six young residents of @entity10 have been arrested for remaking @entity0 's feel good hit video happy @entity0 responded to the shocking arrest late tuesday in a tweet expressing is dismay ' after a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace , police decided to identify those involved in making that clip , ' said @entity10 police chief @entity41 according to the @entity43 news agency			1
by tuesday night , the @entity45 winning singer had weighed in on the controversy			0
' it 's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness , ' @entity0 tweeted , with a link to a @entity52 blog story about the arrests			0
the arrests came despite the three men and three women trying to dial back their fame by setting their video to private when they realized it had angered @entity61 authorities			1
' following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary , all the suspects were identified and arrested , ' said @entity41			0
the @entity3 ' rendition of the hit angered authorities who seemed to fear it was evidence of a new generation casting aside the old @entity61 lifestyle for @entity24 ideals ( a still from the remake is at left , with @entity0 's original at right ) islamic law requires women to cover their heads in public			2
authorities called the video ' vulgar ' their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions			1
@entity41 said they ' confessed to their criminal acts			0
' islamic law stipulates that women must cover themselves in public			2
the video appears to show three women dancing exuberantly to the hit on @entity10 rooftops , sans headress			1
the move comes a perplexing time since just recently @entity3 president @entity100 spoke publicly in support of loosening the state 's cencorship of the internet			0
' we ought to see ( the @entity106 ) as an opportunity			0
we must recognise our citizens ' right to connect to the @entity110 , ' said @entity100 according to the official @entity112 news agency			0
the young people were publicly shamed as their interrogation was aired on @entity3 television along with clips of their video veiled : the three women from the video were seen veiled in the interrogation footage ' after a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace , police decided to identify those involved in making that clip , ' said @entity10 police chief @entity41 ' why are we so shaky ? why have we cowered in a corner , grabbing onto a shield and a wooden sword , lest we take a bullet in this culture war ? ' he said in his weekend speech			1
in a interview with @entity137 last month prior to the arrests , one of the women explained that the video was meant as a celebration of @entity3 and to show that young people there have fun like they do anywhere			1
' despite all the pressures and limitations , ' she said , ' young people are joyful and want to make the situation better			2
they know how to have fun , like the rest of the world			0
