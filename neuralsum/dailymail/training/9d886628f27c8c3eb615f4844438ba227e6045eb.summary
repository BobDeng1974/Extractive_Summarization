for many of us , snails are nothing more than an unpleasant garden pest			0
but thanks to a @entity7 spa they 've become the latest thing in beauty , with the snail slime facial finally arriving on @entity13 shores in one @entity15 salon this week			1
the treatment , which involves having three of the creatures slither up and down your face , has been added to the menu at the simply divine salon in @entity22 , @entity23 by owner @entity24			1
@entity25 , with the help of top dermatologist dr @entity27 , a regular consultant on @entity29 ’s @entity28 , has a team of fully trained ' snail facialists ' who will make sure the creepy crawlies do n’t venture too near the nostrils , mouth and eyes			2
gulp : @entity38 puts the snail slime facial to the test , with the help of three of her salon 's resident snails pioneering : the treatment was first popularised by a salon in @entity47 and is now in the @entity48 thanks to @entity24 according to @entity25 , the results of the £ 50 treatment are instant and ' overwhelming ' thanks to the highly beneficial proteins contained in snail mucus			1
she said : ' it does seem a bit strange at first but the treatment is actually very relaxing and the skin feels marvellous afterwards			0
once clients get used to the feel of the snails on their face , they really enjoy the treatment			2
' the snail facial was pioneered in @entity47 's @entity64 and first became available under the name @entity66 earlier this summer , with the @entity7 salon charging £ 161 for the procedure			1
the 60 snails owned by @entity25 will enjoy a similarly luxurious diet to their @entity7 counterparts - unlimited organic fruit and vegetables			1
' the snails have been specially farmed for us , ' added @entity25			1
' they ’re not the sort you ’ll find in the garden			0
we can tell them apart and we ’ve even given them names			0
too close for comfort ? @entity24 looks tense as the snails move around her face and get very close to her mouth healing : the mucus left behind by the snails is believed to have anti-ageing benefits by proponents ' the snails ' well - being is very important to us			1
once they have been used on a client we make sure they ’re not used again for at least four days			0
' @entity25 has sought advice from snail experts on how to feed and handle the snails and insists that all of her staff are rigorously trained in - house			1
after the facial the snails are ' quarantined ' - separated from the others so there is no danger of cross contamination and clients are told not to wear any make - up or skin care products with chemicals in them before their facial			2
despite the lack of the usual creams and lotions , @entity25 says the results are so powerful that the snails could even be used for people with severe skin conditions such as acne			1
she said : ' the treatment is completely natural and people have been overwhelmed with the instant results			0
anti-ageing : snail mucus contains a cocktail of youth - boosting ingredients including hyularonic acid ' so we have clients with skin problems and also quite a few mature ladies who do n’t want to use the strong chemicals that can be found in certain anti-ageing products			2
' dr @entity27 , who is currently running clinical tests on the efficacy of snail mucus , said : ' @entity127 contains natural antibiotics and hyaluronic acid which hydrates the skin			0
' the theory of the treatment is good , now we want to see all the data			0
the @entity147 have found a way to extract the mucus from snails and put it into skin care products but the live snails should be a lot more effective as its properties are n’t lost over time			1
' i ’m looking forward to conducting the study and finding out the results			0
' @entity25 added : ' this is n’t just a gimmick			2
my spa promotes health and well - being and alternative treatments and this treatment is truly pioneering			0
