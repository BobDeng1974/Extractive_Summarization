by @entity0 last updated at 1:35 pm on 20th november 2011 snipers on board military helicopters will patrol the skies over @entity4 during next summer ’s @entity5			1
sources say the military crackshots – dubbed ‘ heli - snipers ’ by defence chiefs – will fly above the capital in case terrorists attempt an atrocity at the prestigious event			1
the @entity15 snipers are understood to have been training recently at the restricted @entity17 military live - firing range near the @entity20 coast to sharpen their skills			1
taking aim : @entity15 snipers will be deployed in @entity4 to target potential threats to the 2012 @entity5 death from above : the snipers will hover above @entity5 sites in @entity29 helicopters , like this one , which have been used in @entity31 and @entity32 one source told @entity34 that the training had been designed specifically to prepare for an @entity5 deployment to protect stadium sites in @entity4 and elsewhere			1
flying in @entity40 or @entity29 helicopters , the snipers are capable of killing an attacker at a range of more than a mile using a @entity45 ’ rifle , which fires a powerful .50 - calibre half - inch bullet at 2,799 feet per second			1
even at night , the flying snipers can kill an enemy 1,000 yards away using night sights and infra - red lasers for target - marking as they keep in touch with commanders on the ground using encrypted military radio frequencies			2
their rifles have the power to destroy engine blocks and fire through concrete from long range , making it difficult for a terrorist to take cover			1
@entity63 : the snipers will be able to kill suspected terrorists from up to a mile away - even at night the airborne sharpshooters were deployed in @entity31 , where they were described by the @entity68 as a ‘ special weapon ’ against the insurgent threat			2
in @entity31 , the snipers were on standby around the clock to provide protection from the air and carried out sniping and surveillance duties on the ground			2
now , they could find themselves on operational duty in the @entity79 for the first time , helping to protect prime venues such as the 80,000 - seat @entity82 and the @entity83			0
airborne threats : surface - to - air missiles may also be part of the armoury available to @entity5 security forces last week , defence secretary @entity89 revealed in the @entity90 after a question from his predecessor , dr @entity92 , that ground - to - air missiles were part of the armoury that may be used during the @entity5 if required			0
mr @entity89 ’s statement was interpreted as an attempt to show how seriously the @entity79 is taking the terror threat after it was revealed that the @entity97 is preparing to send 1,000 armed agents , including 500 from the @entity99 , to protect its competitors			2
high security : left , police officers take part in a search exercise at the @entity82			0
right , @entity106 cartoonist @entity105 imagines the scene at the start of an event a @entity68 spokesman said last night : ‘ the @entity68 has been fully involved in @entity5 security planning work and it is anticipated that the @entity114 , at the request of the civilian authorities , will provide some specialist support including the use of assets where appropriate			0
however , this will be a police - led operation and any military involvement will be in a supporting role			0
‘ it is too early to talk about the numbers of personnel who may be involved or further details around precisely what support the @entity68 might provide – but ongoing planning to meet a range of contingencies is sensible			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ this work is not in response to any specific threat but , as the @entity89 said in @entity133 , all necessary measures to ensure the security and safety of the @entity137 will be taken			0

@entity15 snipers will be armed with high calibre rifles that can *penetrate* concrete and destroy engine blocks
