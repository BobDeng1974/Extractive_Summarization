when nurse @entity1 saw another mother zooming away from the school gates in a flashy @entity5 convertible , she started to think she might be in the wrong job			1
so she decided to forge a career for herself on the sidelines – or rather on her living room sofa			2
now the 43 - year - old is one of a growing number of ‘ middle - class gamblers ’ who hope to make a fortune by trading on the stock exchange from the comfort of their own homes			1
and she said , “ oh i think she trades in stocks and shares ”			2
‘ so i came home and googled “ trading ” and started messing about and having a play			1
’ thanks to speedy broadband internet , anyone can buy or sell stocks or bet on currency fluctuations on their home computer or laptop			1
for mrs @entity30 , it means she can juggle caring for her three children , her £ 25 - an - hour part - time nursing job and the dream of getting rich quick			1
she said : ‘ i probably do spend too much time on it			1
it is like an addictive computer game			1
‘ i can fit it round my family life , although it can be tricky when the children want to watch a film just as i ’m about to do a big trade			1
‘ i find the best time to trade is between 1pm , when the @entity67 markets wake up , and 5pm , when the @entity69 markets go to bed			1
there seems to be a lot of volatility then			2
but i have to pick up the children from school at 3.30pm , so i often have to drag myself away			2
‘ sometimes i stay up late at night so i can concentrate properly for a few hours			0
’ mrs @entity30 , who is featured in new @entity77 documentary traders : @entity78 , taught herself about the stock exchange with @entity82 videos			0
she then started ‘ dummy trading ’ on a website that allowed her to bet on the real international currency markets with imaginary money			2
in a year , she had made a theoretical £ 1.8million , with a starting base of £ 300,000 , just by guessing which currencies would go up , and which down			0
mrs @entity30 , 43 , says she has made around £ 1,000 since she started trading , but admits her success it is more down to luck than judgement she then raised £ 6,000 to start trading with real money			1
in her first day , she made £ 99.50			0
on her second , she made £ 105			0
but on the third , she lost £ 350 when she accidentally traded £ 30 instead of £ 3 , and forgot to put on a ‘ stop loss ’ to limit her exposure to the market			0
at one point , her fund went down to £ 3,856 , but she claims that after six weeks of real trading she has made around £ 1,000 in total			2
mrs @entity30 admits her success has more to do with luck than skill			0
‘ i know this is just betting under a more acceptable name – it is betting for the middle - classes , ’ she said			1
‘ i ’m not very good with numbers			0
but what i ’ve learned to do is literally just look at the chart and guess , and think which way it ’s going to go			0
’ according to the @entity77 programme , only 10 per cent of the 100,000 retail traders in @entity69 make a consistent profit			0
while mrs @entity30 , from @entity22 , would like a smart new car , she says her real aim is to make enough money to allow her more time with husband @entity121 , a 44 - year - old sales account manager , and their three children , @entity25 , seven , @entity27 , five , and @entity26 , four			1
‘ when you ’re a working mum , you ’re meant to be able to juggle everything , ’ she said			0
‘ what i ’d really like is more time to spend with my family			2
i do n’t need a fancy lifestyle or foreign holidays			0
’ traders : @entity78 starts on monday at 9pm on @entity77 .			0
