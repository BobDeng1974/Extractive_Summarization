by @entity0 and @entity1 two high profile @entity3 women broke their silence on wednesday over the controversy surrounding baby @entity7 - the disabled boy born via surrogacy who was allegedly abandoned by an @entity3 couple in @entity10			1
providing very different perspectives on the ordeal - one touched on @entity3 surrogacy laws , while the other focused on adoption in a global sense			2
before hosting the @entity19 at the @entity20 on wednesday evening , @entity18 host @entity17 told @entity21 she believes @entity22 should look at tackling commercial surrogacy as a nationwide issue			1
' the fact that we have shut the door on @entity49 surrogacy , and now to think we may lose @entity10 , will mean many couples will lose out			1
the @entity52 system is so expensive , although legally safer , but for some couples the cost is out of reach			0
' @entity17 also said that the options for couples who want children but may not be able to have them themselves for any reason were limited and needed attention			1
' we , @entity22 , needs to look at introducing paid surrogacy			1
it ’s very difficult to adopt in @entity22 , there are too many restrictions , we need to make it easier for couples to achieve their dream of having a family			2
' it needs to be tackled nationally , not just by each state , so that paid surrogacy can happen here and with the right guidelines of course , ' she added			1
a mother of two herself - with her youngest child @entity78 born in may of this year - the tv personality then reflected on her own experience as a mother			0
' some of the age limits are ridiculous			0
between us , my husband and i are 80 and would be over the limit but we provide a beautiful home for our children			2
' while @entity89 did n't know all the facts about @entity7 's case , she said a safe home should be found for him ' as soon as possible ' @entity17 had her fair share of difficulties on the road to becoming a parent with her husband , @entity98 ceo @entity36 , including a miscarriage in 2011			1
prior to having their first child , @entity101 , the high - profile pair had a nine - year battle to fall pregnant , including years of @entity105 treatment			0
earlier on wednesday @entity89 shared her thoughts on the tragic case of baby @entity7 - who was said to have been left in @entity10 by @entity3 parents @entity36 and @entity109 after they discovered he had @entity110			1
instead - the took his healthy twin sister @entity113 home with them leaving @entity7 with his surrogate mother @entity115			2
the case caused outrage in @entity22 and around the world , especially after mr @entity119 was revealed to be a convicted child sex offender who served time in prison for a string of offences against girls as young as seven			2
based in @entity128 , the @entity3 actress , 58 , who is an adoption advocate , told @entity21 that there were many special needs children across the world			0
@entity132 will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public 's awareness the co-founder of @entity140 launched the ' @entity141 ' as part of the campaign at @entity144 on wednesday while she did n't know all the facts about @entity7 's case , she said a safe home should be found for him ' as soon as possible '			1
' you know what ? @entity7 happens every minute in @entity150 , ' ms @entity89 said			1
' there are so many special needs children that families do n't have the physical or emotional resources to care for those kids			2
' they are abandoned vulnerable children and they 're the kids that we need to find families for			0
' so i would say for @entity160 , we need to find him a family as soon as possible			0
' the wife of @entity165 star @entity164 , who has adopted two children with her husband , made the comments before a speech launching ' @entity141 ' as part of the @entity140			1
when asked what her opinion was on the controversial topic of @entity10 surrogacy , she said she could n't pass judgement on surrogacy			1
‘ we [ @entity132 ] address abandoned and vulnerable children and we service adoption - surrogacy is another thing but it shows that people are natural human urges who want to love a child so there ’s obviously a huge need to parent children so let ’s try and get all the kids that need that love altogether , ' she said			2
ms @entity89 , who is @entity22 ’s most high - profile adoption advocate launched the @entity141 campaign at @entity144 in @entity20 on wednesday			1
she said the organisation will advocate throughout the year and continue to keep all the issues surrounding abandoned vulnerable children and adoption in the forefront of the public 's awareness			0
' for decades , people were n’t talking about adoption and we did n’t have a system that worked properly and after years of what we ’ve been advocating , we now have the politicians talking and creating new legislation , ' she told @entity21			0
the wife of @entity165 star @entity164 , who has adopted two children with her husband said there were many special needs children across the world ' there ’s new legislation in @entity214 and hopefully that will be harmonised over all the states			1
we ’re talking with @entity218 ’s office			0
he has said he wants to create a better system			0
' so pursue the adoption - we ’re working on it and we ’re gon na make it work more expediently and make sure that it ’s ethical			0
' if we do step up and we do adoption better , we need centres of excellence to provide pre and post adoptions support			0
' i ’d like to see this all over @entity22 to support the families , the children , the relinquishing parents to support everyone in this journey			2
' that ’s the mistake we ’ve made in the past because we did n’t have support for families who had to devour this very complex journey , ' she said			0
