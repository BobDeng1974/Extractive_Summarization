@entity0 and @entity1 headed off to @entity2 on monday , knowing that they may well have sacrificed the first masters level event of the year in the @entity6 cause			1
after sealing @entity9 's win over @entity10 in the @entity11 , they have a ridiculously quick turnaround before the @entity14 tournament starts later this week in the desert setting of @entity16			1
@entity1 is expected to play in the qualifying event on tuesday , while at least @entity0 gets a few days ' grace before the main draw begins			1
@entity0 described leading @entity20 to @entity11 victory over the @entity10 as ' very emotional ' @entity6 no 1 @entity0 was pumped up by his home @entity23 crowd as @entity9 secured a 3 - 1 win over the @entity10 @entity0 celebrates during his straight sets win over @entity27 that clinched the @entity29 a quarter - final place individual compared to team environment , altitude compared to sea level , the desert dry heat compared to @entity23 's cold , the seven hour time difference â€“ it could hardly be more contrasting			1
@entity0 , now back up to no 4 in the world , said : ' it 's going from playing on an indoor court with heavy tennis balls to playing in the desert with very fast balls in very quick conditions in terms of how the ball moves through the air there			1
' the @entity6 no 1 said it is far more realistic for him to do well in the @entity49 that follows later this month			1
' that would be a target for me to have a very good run , ' he admitted			0
the dates and structure of the @entity11 continue to be a problem and those like @entity0 and @entity1 , who have chosen to play for their country , will be at a considerable disadvantage over the next 10 days			1
as @entity0 reflected , this is one reason why the likes of @entity63 and @entity64 sat out the first round of a competition which , as the weekend demonstrated , is a showcase for so much that is good about the sport			1
@entity1 acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the @entity70 the @entity6 gb team celebrate the victory over the @entity10 , with @entity1 ( second left ) and @entity0 ( second right ) @entity0 , embracing @entity9 team captain @entity73 , praised the ' effort and attitude of everyone in the team ' @entity0 will be reunited with coach @entity78 for these two hard court events			1
he is also not far from appointing an assistant to her , who will be important in the weeks that she is unable to travel			0
referring to his search he commented : ' i 'd say it 's fairly close			0
over the next few days i 'll try to arrange someone to do a trial period in the next month or so			0
' @entity78 is next not with me at the beginning of the clay - court stretch ( in april )			2
i get married the week after @entity89			0
i 'm not 100 per cent sure what i 'm going to do afer that			0
' as @entity23 was the latest @entity11 tie to show , there can be a real passion for tennis outside @entity96 in the @entity6 : ' it 's up to the @entity97 to capitalise on it , that 's not my job , ' said @entity0			1
' i think it 's valuable			0
you see the enthusiasm and the passion that people clearly have for tennis right now			0
the 27 - year - old ( right ) wants to appoint an assistant coach to aid @entity78 ' i 'm just happy that when we 've been able to play the big events of the last few years , the crowds have been absolutely fantastic every time			1
' again in the summer i 'm sure we can fill another big arena			0
but we need more than just putting these sort of events on			0
' he also revealed that @entity97 chief executive @entity116 has still not had a proper conversation with him about improving tennis in @entity20 after 14 months in the job			2
they had 15 minutes together in @entity23 which , @entity0 confirmed , was their longest meeting to date : ' i have n't given my opinion or thoughts on how that should be done			2
' i just listened to what he had to say , ' said the 27 - year - old @entity125 , sounding distinctly non-plussed			2
' he sort of took me through a one - page plan , strategy , in terms of how they were going to get more people playing the game			2
getting more people playing is obviously important			0
' but it 's one thing saying it , putting it down on a piece of paper			0
it 's another thing doing it			0
' it is astonishing that @entity116 , who is @entity137 , has not taken the trouble to thoroughly consult @entity20 's finest player since @entity140			2
what a criminal waste of @entity0 's experience , sharp intelligence and obvious passion for @entity6 tennis .			1

@entity0 helped @entity20 beat @entity10 3 - 2 in the @entity11
the @entity6 no 1 now travels to @entity16 for the first @entity14 event of the year
