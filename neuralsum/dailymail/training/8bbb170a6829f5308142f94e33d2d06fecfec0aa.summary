by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has taken a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle			1
the aerospace giant has completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the @entity11			1
the firm is in a four way contest with @entity14 , privately held @entity15 , and @entity16 , @entity18 founder @entity17 company , to develop and build @entity20 commercial space taxis to transport astronauts rather than relying on @entity22 to ferry them to the station			2
@entity2 's @entity24 will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations @entity2 's design would be launched into space using the @entity31 rocket built by the @entity32 , a venture of @entity2 and @entity34 it will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations that rocket uses a @entity22 - built @entity39 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity22			1
the multibillion - dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months , given escalating tensions with @entity22 over its annexation of the @entity46 region of @entity47			2
@entity49 spokeswoman @entity48 said the @entity20 space agency planned to choose one or more of the competitors to continue working on the program in late august or early september			1
@entity53 confirmed that @entity2 had completed a critical design review of its offering in the @entity56 ( @entity58 ) program			0
she said @entity49 was reviewing the data to determine if @entity2 met its required ' success criteria ' for the review			1
@entity14 and @entity15 have sought and won extensions to finish their design reviews by may 2015			0
@entity16 , a privately funded company set up by @entity18 founder @entity17 is also vying for the work			1
@entity66 , vice president and program manager for @entity2 's commercial space exploration programs , said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design , but got ' excellent ' feedback from @entity49 during the review last month			1
' from a technical standpoint , the review went very well , ' he said			0
' to the best of my knowledge we ’re the only @entity81 competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance , ' he said			0
the @entity85 will at first be used to take astronauts to the @entity11 , pictured			0
however , @entity2 also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as @entity91 's inflatable habitats , which will be launched in the future @entity66 said , measured in mass , the @entity2 design for the cargo module was 96 - percent complete at the time of the review , while its design for the crew module was 85 - percent complete , two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design			2
he said the critical design review marked a major step for the @entity2 program			0
' you 've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you 're going to be able to meet those requirements , ' he said			0
@entity2 remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017 , @entity66 said			1
he said @entity2 's design would be launched into space using the @entity31 rocket built by the @entity32 , a venture of @entity2 and @entity34 that rocket uses a @entity22 - built @entity39 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity22			0
he said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles , if necessary , although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher			1
since the @entity132 was retired in july 2011 , the @entity20 has relied on @entity22 to get its astronauts into orbit			2
but through their @entity135 , @entity49 has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft			1
@entity2 has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new crew @entity141 ( @entity24 - 100 ) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years			0
the capsule is funded by @entity49 as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft @entity2 ’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the @entity154 ( @entity155 )			1
they unveiled the new commercial interior of its @entity155 next - generation manned space capsule , showing how people other than @entity49 astronauts may one day travel to space			1
this is the first time they have made the design of the interior public			2
@entity2 and partner @entity91 highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for @entity49 , while @entity91 showcased a full - scale model of its @entity172 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in			1
' we are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential customers - beyond @entity49 - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior , ' said @entity179 , former @entity180 commander and current @entity2 director of crew and mission operations for the @entity135			1
engineers from across @entity2 leveraged the company 's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule 's interior			0
the capsule , interior view of a prototype pictured , will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit			2
it is in direct competition with @entity14 's manned dragon capsule and @entity15 's @entity202 space plane , all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space ' @entity2 's teams have been designing award - winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation , ' said @entity212 , regional director of sales and @entity213 for @entity214			0
' designing the next - generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression			0
a familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with @entity221			0
' three companies are currently receiving funding from @entity49 to develop manned vehicles as part of the @entity135			1
the first is @entity14 , the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade ago and has now flown the unmanned @entity227 spacecraft to the @entity11 three times on its successful falcon 9 series of rockets			0
they are in the process of developing a manned version of the @entity227 ( mockup pictured above ) that can take a crew of seven into orbit , with rumours suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its first crew as early as next year			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven - seater cst - 100 capsule			0
and finally @entity15 are constructing what some regard as the true successor to the @entity132			0
known as the @entity202 ( test vehicle pictured below ) , this ‘ mini-shuttle ’ of sorts will launch upright on top of a rocket , taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding back to @entity221 at the end of its mission			2
@entity202 with testing already underway , @entity202 is expected to undertake its first mission into space for the first time in 2017 on an @entity31 rocket .			1

the @entity154 ( @entity155 ) is designed to fly into orbit
it will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations
one of three vehicles being funded by @entity49 to replace the @entity271
it is expected to begin flights in 2017 at a *similar* time to its rivals
