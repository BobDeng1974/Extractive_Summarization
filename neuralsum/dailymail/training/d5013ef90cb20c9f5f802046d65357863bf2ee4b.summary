@entity7 , 64 , from @entity6 was in the chamber for 53 hours at @entity9 in @entity10 to receive the treatment under the watchful eye of a nurse			1
the chamber acted as a treatment room in which air pressure could be adjusted to give @entity17 a chance to clear out the damaging nitrogen bubbles he got following the dive that went wrong			1
chamber : @entity7 lies in a hyperbaric chamber at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity23 after a diving incident in @entity5 that almost killed him @entity7 and other volunteers had dived on september 18 to capture footage of a ship off the coast of @entity29 , @entity6 according to @entity30			1
the divers used underwater lighting and a video camera to examine the recently discovered @entity34 , a three - masted ship that sank off the coast of @entity29 , @entity6 , in 1899			0
however , on his way down to dive , @entity7 forgot to put on weights			1
and whilst down there , he only had 20 minutes worth of oxygen to use as he dived to see the ship			0
after 19 minutes he started to rise from the depths of the lake and pointed a video camera back down at the ship on the lake ’s floor as he ascended			1
but as he climbed , he soon realized how rapidly he was rising past another diver			0
with over 40 years of experience he knew there was nothing he could do			0
treatment : @entity7 is brought into a hyperbaric chamber which heals patients by creating an oxygen - rich environment for severe wounds or conditions such as anemia or carbon monoxide poisoning after he was hauled into the boat , he told the crew that he had lost control of his arms and legs and could feel prickly sensations in his body			1
a @entity70 helicopter was called along with a boat from the @entity72			0
the national @entity73 assessed his injuries and referred him to @entity9			0
' human soda bottle ' : @entity17 is still staging a recovery from the accident and can not walk during treatment , doctors suggested that his quick ascent from the water had caused nitrogen bubbles to form in his bloodstream , cutting off blood to his spinal cord and other parts of his body			1
@entity7 said : ‘ what i was worried most about was holding my breath if i panicked , because that could have caused a fatal embolism in his lungs			2
@entity93 is what really kills people			0
’ medics had to fly @entity7 on a low - altitude flight to @entity9 in @entity10 after he lost blood following the expedition			2
there , doctors immediately tried a rare treatment which they uncovered in a @entity103			1
dr. @entity104 , medical director of @entity106 ’s center for hyperbaric medicine told @entity30 : ‘ it ’s really rare to have to do that protocol for a couple reasons			2
one is that most people die			0
they never make it to treatment			2
’ according to doctors , @entity7 's body had become like a ' human soda bottle ' that had been shaken up but still had the top on it holding everything inside			2
so they opted to treat him with the hyperbaric @entity122 chamber used is known to mimic a depth pressure of 45 feet to 60 feet below the surface			2
doctors had to make the chamber a depth of 165 feet which was only 10 feet above the chamber ’s maximum limit to mimic @entity17 ’s actual dive depth			1
it was hoped that the treatment would help get the nitrogen in his body from bubbles into a solution and allow it to escape his body slowly and safely			0
if @entity7 had come out of the lake slowly this would have occurred naturally			0
however , when the chamber reached its maximum depth , @entity144 , a nurse who was inside the chamber with him said she saw @entity7 begin to move his arms			1
he has since regained control of his movements but can not walk or move his legs			1
he continues to receive treatment in the hopes that he will be able to improve over time			0
but it is still unknown whether he will make a full recovery			1
‘ it ’s such a rare event , it ’s impossible to tell , ’ @entity104 said			0
‘ what we ’ve gained back , i ’m thrilled about			0

@entity7 , 64 , forgot to put his weights on before the dive
then , 19 minutes later , he ascended from the water too quickly
he soon *complained* that he could not move his arms or legs
he was *airlifted* to *hospital* where he received treatment
doctors *dug* up the treatment in a @entity103
@entity7 had to spend over two days in the hyperbaric chamber
following treatment , @entity7 has not regained the *ability* to walk
it is not known whether he will make a full recovery as the case is so rare
