by @entity0 it should have been the catch of a lifetime – but ended up being the one that got away			2
this huge bluefin tuna brought ashore by five university friends is estimated to be worth close to £ 1million			1
but strict @entity8 laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in @entity10 for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them			1
the girls , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 found the 300lb bluefin tuna floating in waist - deep water near @entity24 in @entity25 while on a beach holiday the girls managed to load the giant fish onto a kayak to bring it safely home where it was taken by officials the giant fish was taken by the @entity33 who have sent it to @entity36 where it will undergo a full post mortem including a toxicology examination to determine how it died in other words @entity18 , 22 , @entity21 and @entity19 , both 23 , and @entity20 and @entity17 , both 24 , will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in @entity25			1
the 7ft 1in specimen , which was perfectly edible , has been sitting in a fisherman ’s freezer prior to being taken to the @entity36 today where it will be dissected and studied by experts , rather than served up in a restaurant			1
the group , who all met at @entity52 and reunited for the break in @entity54 , remained upbeat about missing out on the windfall yesterday			0
miss @entity18 , who works in pr and lives in @entity57 , @entity58 , said : ‘ we ’re not worried that we wo n’t see the money – you ca n’t mourn what you never had			0
it ’s certainly made the holiday			0
’ the friends were heading out for a kayaking session in @entity24 on saturday when they saw the fish floating in waist - deep water near the beach			2
‘ we ’d only just got in the water and were messing around being silly when we saw this massive thing , ’ miss @entity18 added			0
‘ i shouted “ shark ” but then we saw whatever it was was dead and we had a closer look and hauled it up across the kayaks			0
bluefin tuna can live up to 30 years in the @entity79 1,482 the weight in pounds which an adult bluefin tuna can reach 1.05 the amount in millions a tuna sold at auction in @entity10 in january 43 the speed in miles per hour they can travel 4000 the distance in miles a bluefin tuna will migrate from the @entity89 to @entity90 3,500 the price per pound a fresh bluefin tuna in perfect condition can reach 1000 the depth in metres a bluefin tuna can dive 90 the percentage decline in bluefin tuna numbers in the @entity79 due to over-fishing 21 the maximum length in feet of adult fish 30 the maximum age of an adult fish 8 the age at which they reach sexual maturity ' we dragged it ashore and by this time a large crowd had gathered on the beach and saw what we had			1
we tried to flip it over but it was too heavy , so four men had a go and they could n’t lift it either			0
there was a lot of faffing about			0
’ the fish was at first believed to be a yellowfin tuna and a local fisherman was allowed to take it away to cut up and use as bait			2
but a local strandings officer made some checks and stopped him destroying it after discovering it was the much rarer type			0
a 4ft 6in bluefin tuna weighing 300lb valued at £ 500,000 was confiscated by government officials last year after it was caught off the @entity130 coast			1
the tuna found in @entity25 was not weighed but may be worth double that sum as it was longer and likely to have had a wider girth			1
strandings officer @entity135 , who works for @entity136 , said : ‘ it was fascinating just to be able to study such a large and rare creature			0
‘ they do come in our waters but not often and are usually chasing mackerel			2
nobody knows what happened to this one but it may have starved			0
‘ somebody in the neighbouring village had reported seeing what they thought was a dolphin trying to beach itself the night before , which now seems possibly to have been this fish			2
’ bluefin tuna are rarely seen in the sea around @entity156 and are more common in the @entity157 and @entity79			1
a @entity159 spokesman said : ‘ this is a rare event as @entity79 bluefin are only sporadically seen and reported in the @entity162			2
‘ they are rare because they have been fished heavily in recent decades and the species is close to extinction			0
’ in january , a 489lb bluefin tuna was sold in auction in @entity10 for a world - record £ 1.05 million for a fish bluefin tuna migrate from the warm waters in the @entity89 , following the @entity173 to the cold waters between @entity90 and @entity175			1
unusually for fish , bluefin tuna are warm blooded allowing to survive in the cold			1

the giant tuna weighed 300lbs and was more than two metres long
bluefin tuna caught in @entity156 waters can not be legally sold due to @entity8 rules
the fish can reach £ 3,500 per pound at auction in @entity10
a single fish can be worth more than £ 1 million if it is in *excellent* condition
the @entity25 fish will be examined at the @entity36 *tomorrow*
