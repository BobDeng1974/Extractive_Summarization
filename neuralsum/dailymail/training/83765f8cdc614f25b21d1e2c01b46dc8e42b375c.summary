@entity1 chief executive @entity0 defended his £ 215,000 - a - year salary because of his job 's ' tough responsibilities ' a council chief has defended his £ 215,000 - a - year taxpayer - funded salary because of his job ’s tough ‘ responsibilities ’			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity0 told workers he could justify being paid £ 70,000 more than the prime minister because of the work that comes with his role , such as waste disposal and keeping the county ’s buses running on time			1
according to an internal document seen by @entity20 , mr @entity0 ’s huge pay was called into question by one of his own workers during an online ‘ ask me anything ’ session in november			2
a council worker , using the name @entity27 , asked the chief executive : ‘ dear mr @entity0 , why , in a time of cuts , are we paying some staff posts , including yours , more than the prime minister gets paid ? ’ @entity34 is paid £ 142,000 a year			1
mr @entity0 replied : ‘ @entity35			2
i do get paid a lot of money			0
the council uses external advice and benchmarking to set this salary			0
‘ the reason the council sets it at this level is because of the responsibilities involved			0
‘ these include a budget of £ 1.7bn providing services to 1.1m residents			0
’ council workers reacted with fury to mr @entity0 ’s defence of his pay			1
one enraged @entity1 worker , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ i find the chief executive ’s salary laughable			1
justifying his wages due to the amount of public he serves and budget he is accountable for is not comparable to @entity34			0
‘ our pm has the interest of 65million people and a multi-billion pound budget serving and protecting this country ’s welfare and security			0
‘ in these times of austerity mr @entity0 has kicked off another initiative of asking @entity1 to recycle one extra plastic bottle per week which will save £ 200k per year			2
‘ i can think of a quicker way for @entity75 to meet its target and that 's not by throwing away one bottle of @entity79			0
’ a council worker asked mr @entity0 how he could defend being paid tens of thousands of pounds more than prime minister @entity34 as well as his huge salary , mr @entity0 is in line for a one - off £ 100,000 bonus if he meets ‘ performance - related targets ’ by 2018			1
@entity85 , chief executive of the @entity86 , said : ‘ a council chief executive certainly has some important responsibilities , but it 's no surprise that residents in @entity75 wonder if they quite equate to those of the prime minister			1
‘ big pay packets and perks for the top brass are especially questionable when there has been pay freezes and even cuts across the rest of the public sector			0
senior salaries have to be brought under control , so that councils can focus resources on frontline services			0
’ earlier this year @entity106 challenged the leader of @entity1 , @entity108 , to justify 60 per cent pay rises for councillors and senior members of the council while opposing legislation that would have upped poorest - paid workers to a £ 7.65 an hour wage			1
@entity117 mp @entity116 asked mr @entity108 : ‘ why would you oppose giving the poorest paid workers a living wage and yet increase your own salary by 60 per cent and give a load of cash to the chief officers ? ’ at the time , mr @entity108 said lower paid staff had seen their wages increase			2
a council spokesman said : ‘ this response did not seek to compare the two salaries but rather pointed out that the role had been assessed independently from the chief executive based on the fact that he has responsibility for a budget of £ 1.7bn , has guided the county council to achieving savings of £ 260m in the past four years and is now steering it to a further £ 250m savings over the next five years			2

@entity1 chief asked why he **deserves** £ 215,000 - a - year salary
council worker asked him how he could justify being paid more than pm
chief executive @entity0 earns £ 70,000 more than @entity34
he is also in line for a £ 100,000 bonus in 2018 if he meets targets
@entity0 said he **deserves** wage because of ' tough responsibilities '
furious council workers say chief executive 's huge salary is ' laughable '
