disgusting : a chewing gum ban could be introduced in @entity1 @entity1 is set to become the first town in @entity3 to introduce a @entity5 - style ban on chewing gum			1
anyone caught chewing gum would face an on - the - spot fine under the proposal , which was drawn up after 22 pieces of discarded gum were found in just one square foot of pavement			1
those in favour of introducing the ban point to the cost of removing gum , the nuisance caused by it sticking to people 's shoes and the eyesore it creates			1
the proposal has been put forward by @entity25 , a group of businesses in the @entity28 town , which plans to lobby the council to adopt it as policy			1
the group wants resident to give their views on the plans as it looks to boost its case with the local authority			0
@entity25 spokeswoman @entity38 said it can cost up to 10p to remove a single piece of gum trodden into the pavement , which includes paying for the chemicals and manpower			1
she said it is also unsightly , and added : ' cleaning this mess up is an impossible task , it is costly and takes time , not to mention unpleasant			0
' we are also trying to get the message across the people to be considerate			0
i is a problem in central @entity1 but i also think it is a nationwide problem			0
' chewing gum has been banned in @entity5 for around 20 years , but the authorities made an exception for those with doctors prescriptions in 2004			1
clean : the pavements of @entity1 in @entity28 could soon be chewing gum free the strict ban on selling , importing or manufacturing gum was brought in by the city state 's founding father , @entity64 , who was fed - up with the litter			1
vandals were also reported to have been leaving used gum in keyholes and mail boxes as well as on buttons inside lifts			2
anyone caught breaking the ban by chewing gum can be fined but not , as has often been claimed , sentenced to corporal punishment			1
smugglers face a stiffer penalty , up to a year in prison and a fine equivalent to around Â£ 10,000			2
@entity64 once responded to criticism that banning gum stifled creativity because people could not concentrate , by saying : ' if you ca n't think because you ca n't chew , try a banana			2
' costly : removing a single piece of chewing gum trodden into the pavement can cost up to 10p @entity1 council leader , @entity90 , said the borough could not make any commitments on bringing in such a ban in the town but was open to suggestions			1
he added : ' this is the kind of thing where we say if people want to come to us with proposal then we are quite prepared to listen			0
the difficulty with this will be how easy is it to enforce			0
' i do n't perceive gum to be a massive problem from what i have seen but if other people do and there are areas where evidence clearly shows that it is , then we are quite prepared to listen			2
' but @entity114 , corporate affairs manager for @entity115 @entity3 , said such a ban would be unfair			2
she added : ' the only effective and sustainable solution to littered gum is to encourage people to dispose of their used gum responsibly			2
outlawed : the city state of @entity5 where chewing gum has been made for more than 20 years ' tackling the problem of littered gum is something that we take extremely seriously			1
we promote good gum disposal messages via packaging , point of sale and other communication materials which are regularly seen by millions of our consumers every day			0
' we also fund a number of great campaigns that aim to encourage responsible litter disposal including our @entity135 it ! schools programme and the annual @entity138 campaign , which has seen significant reductions in gum litter in the areas where it has been in place			0
' we believe these campaigns are a more effective way to address the issue rather than imposing bans or taxes that would unfairly punish regular chewers , the vast majority of whom dispose of their gum responsibly			0
' last year , painter @entity153 found a novel way of dealing with the unsightly come covering the streets of east @entity156			0
the artists spent hours at a time painting around 8,000 blots of gum , with his subjects including everything from the @entity162 to @entity163 .			0

anyone caught chewing gum in the town would face an on - the - spot fine
it is aimed at cutting the cost of removing gum trodden into pavements
the @entity5 - style ban is being proposed by businesses in the area
