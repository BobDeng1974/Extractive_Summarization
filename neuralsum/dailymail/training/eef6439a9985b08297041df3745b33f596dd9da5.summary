these dramatic photos capture a herd of elephants as they charge towards the @entity3 in @entity4 during their seasonal migration - chasing away hundreds of buffalo cooling off in the shallow water			1
@entity9 zoologist @entity8 photographed the majestic elephants as they approached the river , where roughly 500 buffalo were escaping from the parched @entity14 heat			1
the herd of roughly 25 elephants - both adults and calves - can be seen sloping down a grassy hill before breaking into a run as they get closer to the water - a scarce resource during the dry season			1
watering hole : @entity9 zoologist @entity8 first captured roughly 500 buffaloes as they cooled off in the shallow water of the @entity3 in @entity4 migration : the zoologist photographs the herd of thirsty elephants - roughly 25 adults and calves - as they make their way towards the water charge : the elephants , pictured in the foreground of the image , picked up speed as they approached the water , ready to chase away the lingering buffaloes startled : at the sight of the elephants , some of the buffaloes start to leave the shallow water and climb up the grassy hill on the other side of the river , pictured right the elephants are then captured driving away the buffalo - who flee the watering hole at the sight of the stampeding herd			1
the chase is made more dramatic by the cloud of dust that is kicked up by the animals as they charge over the parched @entity14 ground			1
after chasing away lingering buffalo from the river bank in a dramatic pursuit , the elephants are left to relax in the water - where they are photographed frolicking and playing happily			1
but dr @entity8 , who watched the scene from 500 metres away at the @entity67 , said that there was no physical contact between the two species			1
the zoologist , who is now based in @entity72 , said : ' an elephant family - both adults and calves - approached the @entity3 river after a long journey			1
they started running towards the water when it came into sight			0
' elephants are herbivores , but they are very protective of their young calves , so they started chasing away a huge herd of buffaloes			2
round up : the elephants break through the herd of buffalo standing in the river , before continuing up the grassy bank on the other side protective : more elephants from the herd join in chasing the buffaloes			2
dr @entity97 explained that the usually docile animals would have been protecting their calves force : ears flapping in the wind , the elephants can be seen running faster as they drive the lingering buffalo from the water - a scare resource during the dry season drama : dust is kicked up by the animals as the chase intensifies			1
dr @entity97 described the experience as ' watching the @entity111 in real life ' ' the buffaloes fled the scene , running up the hill , away from the river			0
when all the buffaloes have left the river , the elephants started drinking and playing in the water			0
' the dust that the animals kicked up added mystery and excitement to the scene			0
' during the dry season in september , water resources for animals , like elephants , are very limited			2
it forces the animals to go on long journeys through the scrub in search of something to drink			0
dr @entity97 continued : ' the reaction i get is unbelievable and generally people ca n't believe i saw this			0
' they say it is like watching the @entity111 in real life			0
' i was thrilled to witness this , it was a very powerful moment and i appreciated every second of it			0
' elephants are highly intelligent animals and are usually very gentle with other creatures			0
' even though the elephants chased away the buffaloes they did n't physically attack any of them - throughout the chase there was no physical contact between the two species			0
' elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food , water and mates , and typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores , which will usually stay out their way .			2
