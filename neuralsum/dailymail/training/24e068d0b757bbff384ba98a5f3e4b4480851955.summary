by @entity0 @entity1 looked flat just after tea at @entity3 , @entity4 was in hospital and the prospect of @entity7 blowing away the last two days of this fourth @entity8 loomed large			1
then @entity9 rocked @entity11 ’s foundations			0
what an extraordinary transformation in a last session which saw nine wickets crash and @entity1 claim a sensational innings - and - 54 - run victory to guarantee at least a share of this @entity19 series			1
and what a spineless , pathetic display from an @entity11 side who have imploded since their historic victory at @entity24 under the leadership of a captain in @entity27 who just did not look interested			0
video scroll for @entity29 on @entity1 victory and @entity4 nose - break update great day : @entity32 celebrates dismissing @entity27 as one of his four wickets at @entity3 done and dusted : @entity35 finished off @entity11 at @entity3 as the hosts crushed the visitors on day three how crucial , with biblical rain apparently heading to @entity39 , was the intervention of the remarkable @entity32 and the brilliant @entity41 in a thrilling session which gave @entity1 victory in effectively two - and - a - half days			1
the farcical loss of at least two hours of play on friday because of the limitations of the @entity48 drainage had increased the need for @entity1 to press for victory with such a bad forecast for the final two days			0
yet it seemed that they would face frustration , not least when @entity4 was struck such a nasty blow through his helmet on to his nose that not only ruled him out of bowling yesterday but may force him to miss the @entity8 next week			2
@entity1 initially looked lacklustre in the field , @entity41 appeared out of sorts and @entity4 was being badly missed as @entity11 moved to 33 at tea for the loss of only @entity63 , who provided @entity64 with a much - needed wicket			1
easy does it : @entity35 wheels away as @entity69 can only look back at his wicket as @entity11 lost out all @entity11 had to do was bat their way through a single session against a depleted @entity1 attack and then hope that @entity76 could come to their rescue and allow them to head south for the final test with all to play for			1
yet they could not even do that , crashing to a humiliating defeat which saw four wickets fall for eight runs before all remaining nine were demolished for a further 128 runs to leave @entity11 in tatters			0
@entity11 ’s inadequacy should take nothing away from the brilliance of an @entity1 side who have spectacularly found their feet under @entity29 after hitting rock bottom with their own last - day capitulation in the second test			1
at the centre of the drama was again the distinctive figure of @entity9 who , in the space of two tests , has gone from a spinner whom @entity1 did not really trust to a match - winner of almost @entity105 - like proportions			0
tough day : @entity106 and co had a nightmare while @entity41 chipped in with a couple of wickets delighted : @entity35 jumps for joy as he wraps up the victory on day three at @entity3 on saturday it was at @entity3 where @entity9 once took 12 wickets in a match for @entity116 and now he mesmerised an @entity11 side supposedly proficient against spin for the second successive test after excelling in @entity120			1
@entity9 had taken six wickets in the second innings in that comprehensive victory at the @entity124 and now he added four more to thrill the @entity39 crowd and take his tally to an extraordinary 19 in four matches in this series			0
when you consider that only @entity131 , with 20 victims in 1967 , has taken more wickets with spin in a home series against @entity11 for @entity1 then you can appreciate the scale of this @entity137 ’s achievement			2
@entity11 simply had no answer to @entity9 , who has bowled his off - spin significantly quicker since @entity140 ’s , and the imperious @entity41 , who claimed supposed danger man @entity106 for the fourth time for just seven runs			2
reasons to be cheerful : @entity29 and @entity41 leave the pitch after winning the test match that was a second wicket for @entity41 , cleared by judge @entity147 before the match over his spat with @entity150 and now just eight wickets away from overtaking sir @entity152 and becoming @entity1 ’s leading @entity154 wicket - taker			1
the stage is set for him to claim the record at @entity157			0
@entity41 left the field for 35 minutes feeling unwell after claiming @entity106 , a concern for @entity1 with the fifth test coming on friday , but he was back by the time @entity35 wrapped up victory with the final two wickets in two balls			0
@entity35 had earlier been denied the wicket of @entity166 , well caught by @entity167 , when he overstepped but it barely held up @entity1 , who had the game wrapped up by 6.20pm , to the joy of a near capacity @entity3 crowd			2
@entity9 even had a hand in the one wicket that did not fall to a bowler , turning and throwing brilliantly to run out @entity166 and make up for @entity35 ’s mistake in denying himself a wicket that would have been invaluable to him			0
painful : @entity4 takes a big hit to the face after a @entity181 ball went straight through the grille of his helmet distress : @entity4 looks in a bad way after the incident on saturday afternoon bandaged up : @entity4 looks in a much better way after getting treatment for the injury @entity1 had earlier batted with admirable tempo to extend their overnight lead to 215 , @entity192 and @entity193 leading the way before @entity4 was struck an ugly blow the ball after pulling @entity181 for successive sixes			1
@entity4 had cut a disconsolate figure as he walked round the @entity3 outfield having had his nose stitched up to depart for hospital and checks for both a break and possible concussion			0
yet @entity1 ’s heroics and his award as man of the match would have cheered him , not least the way @entity1 found a way to win so spectacularly without him and with @entity35 and @entity64 still failing to match the bowling of the big two			2
bad day : @entity63 walks from the field with his head down after his dismissal and @entity11 's collapse @entity4 ’s fitness for the @entity157 must be in doubt but @entity218 , who faces a fitness test tomorrow , is confident of being fit after a foot injury while the return of @entity222 to the squad for this match showed he is on the way back			1
suddenly @entity1 are looking a formidable young side and can look forward to @entity157 with much excitement .			0
