by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 04:48 est , 25 october 2013 details of the kind of service passengers can expect when a publicly run key rail line returns to the private sector are being laid out today by the government			1
@entity8 and rail unions have been among those bitterly opposed to the refranchising of the @entity12 line which has been run in the public sector for four years			1
the @entity15 union has said that the prospectus being revealed today will see a return to ' third - class travel ' on the line which runs from @entity19 to @entity20			1
@entity8 and rail unions have been among those bitterly opposed to the refranchising of the @entity12 line which has been run in the public sector for four ministers insist the so - called ' third class ' involve an offer of an airline - style ' premium economy ' service , between the present standard class and first class			1
the @entity15 and others have also pointed out that the @entity12 has proved a real value - for - money line in that it has returned large amounts of money to the @entity34 since @entity35 pulled out of the franchise in november 2009			1
@entity38 transport secretary @entity37 said @entity39 should cap rail fare rises instead of ' obsessing about @entity12 ' @entity8 has also expressed disappointment that , with the franchise programme on the railways put back and altered following the botched @entity46 franchise bidding process , the government has appeared to prioritise the @entity12 refranchising - due in early 2015 - for political purposes			1
shadow transport secretary @entity37 said today : ‘ @entity39 should tackle his government 's cost - of - living crisis and cap rail fare rises for struggling commuters , instead of obsessing about handing @entity12 over to the private sector			2
‘ @entity12 is working well and will have returned £ 800 million to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year			0
‘ this government has learned nothing from the @entity46 franchising fiasco , which saw more than £ 50 million of taxpayers ' money wasted in compensation to train companies because of ministers ' incompetence			0
' the @entity15 has said that it understands the @entity12 contract would be awarded ' on lucrative , profiteering terms that will enable them to reduce the quality of service [ and ] introduce a new band of third - class travel '			1
@entity73 high - speed train company @entity72 has said it wants to bid for the @entity12 franchise in partnership with @entity77 company @entity76 which already runs a number of @entity80 domestic lines			2
@entity15 general secretary @entity81 said : ‘ it is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the reprivatisation of the @entity12 when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service contributing a billion pounds back to the government while the private operators are milking huge profits and soaking up vast taxpayer subsidies			2
’ he added : ’ if the government are allowed to get away with this , passengers can expect third class services , shoddy performance and higher fares while the private companies get a gold - plated , eleven year franchise that will enable them to launder hundreds of millions of pounds into the pockets of their shareholders			0
' it stinks and it must be stopped and the campaign to prevent the reprivatisation will haunt this rotten government right up to polling day			0
’ a @entity108 spokesman said : ' this is ill informed scaremongering from the @entity15			0
by choosing to release inaccurate information , they are misleading the public			0
we have no intention of requiring a “ third class ” service , reducing performance levels , or in any way devaluing this vital railway			0
as the independent @entity121 concluded , franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike			0

@entity87 will propose new ' third class ' service in bid to *re-nationalise* the @entity12 *mainline* from @entity19 to @entity20
@entity8 and rail unions have been among those bitterly opposed to the refranchising of the @entity12 line
