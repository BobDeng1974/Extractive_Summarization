by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 30 april 2013 when police were told a kangaroo was on the loose in rural @entity4 , they probably thought the callers had been drinking			1
but as officers carried out an operation against rural drink drivers they were handed this remarkable picture of a wallaby hopping down the road			2
the image , taken in the village of @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity4 , shows the wild animal caught in a vehicle 's headlights			1
wallaby in the wild : police were handed this picture of a wallaby bounding down a country lane in the village of @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity4 the animal has now been nicknamed ' @entity27 ' by locals after the 1960s @entity30 tv series			1
wallabies are native to @entity30 but have been introduced in the @entity32 in parks , zoos and farms			0
it is thought the @entity4 wallaby had escaped from a nearby farm near the 19th century @entity40 adventure centre			1
it was spotted after a series of alleged sightings of the so - called ' @entity44 ' - a wildcat on the loose on the outskirts of a nearby village			2
sighting : police have received regular reports of the wallaby on the loose - but had dismissed them police constable @entity51 of @entity48 later posted the picture on his force 's facebook page			1
@entity55 said : ' we have been receiving reports of a kangaroo being on the loose in @entity15 - at first , i suspected that it was just residents in @entity15 wanting a @entity62 to rival the @entity44			1
' but when the photographic evidence came through we could n't really dispute that there was a wallaby , or a kangaroo , in the road			2
in fact the photo would suggest i have been overly suspicious			0
' as far as we know it 's still out and about , it 's certainly an interesting one			0
' kangaroos and wallabies are marsupials and are closely related , though adult kangaroos are larger than wallabies			0
they can be identified via their teeth , which are different as kangaroos mainly eat grass while wallabies mostly eat leaves			0
one local @entity84 posted a message saying : ' it 's been living in the woods at the hall for a few weeks now and we 've seen it numerous times			0
so it is definitely real ! ' another local said : ' remember back in the day when i came to the pub one night and told you i had seen a @entity94 or @entity62 jump across the road in front of my van one night and you all told me i was crazy and took the mick for months ?
