by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there 's still five months until @entity3 , but the @entity4 may already have a new pantomime villain on its hands			0
from what we 've seen of @entity9 since his arrival from @entity11 , watching @entity12 will be pretty entertaining next season			1
pushing , shoving , shouting and scoring , @entity14 looks to have found a real live wire in the @entity18 international			2
he 's big , strong , excellent in the air and - above all else - knows where the goal is			0
fifty - six goals in two seasons at the @entity40 is testament to that			0
the fact @entity34 has returned to @entity35 should n't hinder @entity9 's transition			1
if anything , it should help			0
who better than the @entity47 - one of the best lone strikers to have played in the @entity4 - than to guide @entity12 's £ 32million investment ? @entity34 knows the @entity4 and its defenders like the back of his hand			1
that knowledge will prove vital			0
of course , @entity34 will still want to play as often as possible next season - but he knows his place at @entity35			1
@entity9 's the main man , while @entity34 is now the supporting act			1
man in charge : @entity12 boss @entity14 prefers playing with a lone striker and two attacking wingers familiar sight : @entity9 , pictured here celebrating his first goal , netted 56 times in the last two seasons that role as a lone centre - forward is vital to the way @entity14 wants his side to play			1
he tried @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 in the position last season with varying degrees of success			0
but in @entity77 , the special one knows he has someone with the raw materials to lead the line effectively next season			2
you only have to look at his impact on @entity11 last season in a similar role to know @entity9 can cut the mustard for @entity12			1
his bulky 6ft 2ins frame means he is unlikely to suffer at the hands of the @entity4 's bully - boys			0
the way he stood toe - to - toe with @entity12 skipper @entity91 during last season 's @entity93 semi-final first - leg at the @entity40 spoke volumes			2
perhaps @entity91 was testing @entity9 knowing full well they 'd be on the same team a few months later.if it was a test , then @entity9 passed it with flying colours			0
he did n't flinch as he eyeballed @entity91			0
hard man : @entity9 did n't back down against @entity12 skipper @entity91 in last season 's @entity93 main man : @entity9 looks certain to lead the line for @entity12 next season after arriving for £ 32million this summer and eight days later at @entity35 , an all - action display ( some might say drogba-esque ) eased @entity11 into the @entity93 final with a 3 - 1 win			1
if @entity14 needed any persuading over @entity9 , then that night would have halted any lingering doubts			2
and now the @entity111 has finally got his hands on the @entity114 - born striker - the man he believes can lead his side to the title			2
whether he can emerge from @entity34 's shadow and become @entity12 's next great centre - forward remains to be seen			1
but the ingredients are there , and with @entity34 on hand to show him the ropes , everything is in situ for @entity9 to live up to his £ 32million price tag			1
and if he needs any help with living up to his role as a pantomime villain , then his manager knows a thing or two about that .			0

@entity9 was involved in an altercation on his second @entity12 appearance
he also *grabbed* two assists in the 3 - 1 win against @entity139
the @entity141 scored on his debut following his £ 32million move from @entity11
he will lead the line for @entity14 's side next season
@entity9 will be able to learn from *veteran* @entity34 at @entity35
