by @entity0 a group of farmers have come up with an ingenious way of recycling the thousands of external fuel tanks jettisoned by @entity6 planes during the @entity7 - by turning them into river boats and canoes			1
the huge chunks of aluminum were discarded by @entity6 planes during the late 1960s and early 1970s and remain scattered throughout the forests of southern @entity14 to this day			0
but rather than leaving the abandoned fuel tanks to go unused , local farmers have started cleaning and customising the hollow tubes , with dozens of them now in use as river boats and canoes throughout the region			1
@entity24 : a group of farmers in southern @entity14 have started using thousands of fuel tanks cast off by @entity6 fighter jets and bombers during the @entity7 as river boats and canoes			1

although they were key to increasing endurance and even allowed the planes to be refueled while flying , the auxiliary fuel tanks also slowed the planes down and limited maneuverability , so could easily be cast off if they needed to accelerate quickly to attack or escape the enemy			2
now the fuel tanks are experiencing a second life as key modes of transport among the remote and heavily forested areas of south @entity14			0
getting around : with limited roads connecting small villages , the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places , so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people the fuel tanks are now experiencing a second life as key modes of transport among the remote and heavily forested areas of southern @entity14 although they were key to increasing endurance and even allowed the planes to be refueled while flying , the auxiliary fuel tanks also slowed the planes down and limited maneuverability , so could easily be cast off if they needed to accelerate quickly to attack or escape the enemy idea : farmers were among the first to spot an alternative use for the large pieces of aluminum scattered throughout the local forests - not least because they naturally float thanks to their hollow bodies , lightweight frames and aerodynamic designs with limited roads connecting small villages , the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places , so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people			2
although they have been used for centuries , the traditional wooden river boats that are built and used in the area have a fairly limited lifespan and are in need of regular maintenance and repair			0
it 's not surprising then that farmers were among the first to spot an alternative use for the large pieces of aluminum scattered throughout the local forests - not least because they naturally float thanks to their hollow bodies , lightweight frames and aerodynamic designs			0
with just a small amount of customisation - including cutting large holes in the top to make them easier to board and load - the abandoned fuel tanks are now considered a simple and free way for the poor farmers in remote areas to ensure they are able to buy and sell their products in nearby villages .			0

fuel tanks **ditched** by *aircraft* during the @entity7 are still scattered throughout the country 's forests
local farmers have started customising the hollow aluminum tubes to be used as river boats and canoes
auxiliary fuel tanks were **ditched** by fighter jets as they limited speed and maneuverability in an *emergency*
