by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 23:17 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 21 september 2012 @entity2 , who was sacked in the @entity4 reshuffle , has hit out at chancellor @entity5 @entity5 was today accused of trying to consign reform elderly care to the ‘ trash bin ’			1
@entity8 @entity2 , who was social care minister until this month ’s reshuffle , accused the chancellor and the @entity11 of ‘ bureaucratic inertia ’ in holding back reform of the social care system			1
mr @entity2 told @entity1 that an overhaul of the way care is funded , based on proposals drawn up by economist @entity18 has been finalised , but the @entity11 will not sign off on the £ 1.7bn cost			1
‘ in the end there is a question of political will to overcome that bureaucratic inertia , ’ he said			0
‘ the thing that has kept @entity26 alive has been the deputy prime minister @entity27 saying this has got to stay on the table while there was a desire by the @entity11 to get it in the trash bin as quickly as possible			0
‘ it is an institutional thing			0
there is a real inertia around reforms of this sort that has bedevilled reform of social care for two decades			1
‘ i have no doubt it was a key factor why @entity43 failed to deal with it when there was money around			0
‘ it has been a key drag on trying to make progress over the last two years of the coalition			0
’ last month it was reported that @entity51 had pledged to find the money , which would cap the amount individuals pay at £ 35,000 – with the taxpayer picking up the rest			2
but mr @entity2 said there was little sense of urgency : ‘ there was certainly no sign of the @entity11 beating a path to the door of the @entity64			1
’ however , government insiders sought to play down mr @entity2 ’s insight into the progress of the plan			1
‘ if this former minister really believes what he has said he was clearly out of the loop , ’ said one source			2
’ mr @entity2 also claimed that the controversial reforms of the @entity76 , drawn up by @entity77 who was demoted in the reshuffle , had made senior minister reluctant to tackle social care			1
‘ there is no doubt that the controversy around the health reforms made some of the actors in this worry about future reform			2
‘ but many of those players , including the prime minister , deputy prime minister and others , probably had n’t tuned into enough at the time to see the fact that this was a popular set of changes not a controversial set of changes			0
’ chancellor @entity5 was accused of having ' no sense of urgency ' about helping the elderly fund their long - term care mr @entity2 said he had received scores of ‘ heart - rending ’ letters form families in despair at the care system ’ ‘ i still think there is a good chance this can happen but the only way to help it happen at this point is bringing into sharp relief the @entity11 ’s role			1
’ mr @entity18 suggested a cap of £ 35,000 for care bills			2
the state would pay costs over this amount while people could also take out insurance to pay fees up to £ 35,000			2
ministers said they supported the idea in principle but have not committed the £ 1.7billion needed to fund the reform			1
the government is considering a watered down version , which could impose a voluntary cap which would only protect those who paid a fee to ‘ opt in ’			2
writing in the @entity134 , mr @entity2 added : ‘ the @entity11 ’s view is simple , kick the can down the road ... there ’s no sense of urgency			1
’ but a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ @entity11 has been key in getting this issue back on the agenda , not least by working to deliver stable public finances that are essential if @entity26 is to be delivered			0
’ campaigners responded to mr @entity2 's remarks with a call for government action			1
@entity149 , charity director general of @entity150 said : ' putting a cap on lifetime care costs would grant older people and their families the invaluable gift of peace of mind			0
' coming toward the end of life and having to ask for help in carrying out everyday tasks is often devastating in itself but in addition to risk losing nearly everything you have ever worked for in care fees is heart - breaking			0
' those living in a care home have to live with the fear of what will happen to them when their savings run out and whether they will be forced to leave			0
' this is why the government must show the vision and courage to bring in the @entity26 reforms as the report recommended and so create a just and compassionate legacy for generations to come			1
' @entity43 today repeated its offer of cross-party talks to find a long - term solution to the funding of elderly care			0
@entity188 , shadow care minister said : ' @entity43 has been warning for months that the government is kicking long - term care funding into the long grass			2
' this issue has bedevilled governments of all political persuasions for many years , because there are no simple solutions or easy options			0
' all the parties must now come together to try and reach consensus about how we tackle the immediate care crisis and develop a better , fairer system for the future			0
