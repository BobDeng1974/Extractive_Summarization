by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 13:11 est , 4 june 2013 study : smokers cost their employers an extra $ 5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers smokers cost their employers an extra $ 5,816 annually compared to nonsmoking workers , according to researchers			1
the costs primarily come from higher health care expenses , excess absenteeism and lost productivity due to smoke breaks , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity15			1
' this research should help businesses make better informed decisions about their tobacco policies , ' said lead researcher @entity20 of @entity21			0
' we constructed our calculations such that individual employers can plug in their own expenses to get more accurate estimates of their own costs			0
' the extra expense that an employer will pay on average for a smoking employee could run as high as $ 10,125 , the study found			0
one eight - minute smoke break a day could cost employers $ 1,641 annually , based on the average hourly rate plus benefits ( $ 26.49 ) earned by a smoking employee			1
but the researchers say it is more likely that employers lose even more money - up to $ 3,077 annually - to smoke breaks , now that most companies ban smoking directly outside of their offices , so employees must venture further from the office to puff a cigarette			1
the larger number assumes that employees are taking two 15 - minute smoke breaks daily			0
on an annual basis per smoker : $ 1,641 to $ 3,077 : reduced productivity due to smoke breaks $ 2,056 : health care costs for self - insured employers $ 517 : excess absenteeism $ 462 : reduced productivity related to the effects of nicotine addiction in addition to smoke breaks , the researchers say companies should also account for annual costs associated with excess absenteeism ( $ 517 annually ) , reduced productivity related to the effects of nicotine addiction ( $ 462 annually ) and extra health care costs for self - insured employers ( $ 2,056 annually )			1
@entity70 calls the cost estimates conservative because , saying it even takes into account the annual pension savings from a smoker 's early death , which amount to roughly $ 296 per year			2
' employers try to correct for the idea that smokers cost more by paying them somewhat less , ' lead researcher @entity20 of @entity21 told @entity81			0
' even when we adjusted for that , smokers still cost more , ' he said			0
by comparison , the @entity85 estimated a decade ago that productivity losses and medical costs amount to about $ 3,400 per smoker annually .			2

researchers found smoke breaks cost employers between $ 1,641 and $ 3,077 per smoker annually in lost productivity
higher health care costs average $ 2,056 annually
excess absenteeism costs roughly $ 517 each year
