by @entity0 so i ’m single again			1
i ’ve split up with @entity2 , whom i had been dating for about four months			1
the reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too fast from the dating stage to the living - together stage			2
this was partly because @entity10 is from @entity11 and i did n't want her to incur the huge costs of living out of hotels in @entity14 , but clearly there was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly , which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic			2
over : @entity0 explains why he and @entity2 broke up after dating for four months whenever any girlfriend comes into a tight group of friends it ’s difficult but when they have practically no shared experiences or associations it ’s almost impossible for the relationship to thrive – and that is what started to happen with me and @entity2			1
perhaps if it was n’t for the cabin fever we suffered in my apartment in @entity35 the relationship might have endured , after all @entity2 is stunning , classy , witty , clever and has a great sense of style – even if it was utilised to veto several of the items of clothing in my wardrobe ( see previous weeks ’ blogs )			1
too much , too soon : ' there was an emotional cost to moving in together so quickly , which was that it made our relationship far too claustrophobic , ' explains @entity45 and although viewers of made in @entity35 may not have seen this side of her towards me on yesterday ’s @entity50 show she is also warm , caring and affectionate , and i do hope we can remain friends			2
the boys seemed to receive the news of my split with a stunned silence ( or fear ) and there was a trademark made in @entity35 pause when i made the announcement at dinner			0
one plus point from the dinner was that even @entity66 was forced to admit of me , ' i do n’t love the guy but you ca n’t fault him , he always wears a nice suit			0
' striking : ever the style chameleon , @entity0 showcases his fashion credentials in a mustard jacket on monday 's show cleaning up : @entity2 finds offensive jacket in @entity0 's wardrobe , which goes straight in charity shop pile my mustard coloured suit was certainly a bit of a departure from the rather more sober slate grey numbers the other boys were wearing on the night and before we sat for dinner , we said a quick @entity87 grace : @entity88 , @entity90 per @entity89			1
all the @entity94 boys ( @entity92			0
@entity91 and @entity95 ) know this well as it is said at every meal at school			0
it roughly translates to , ' may he who is blessed bless [ this food ] through @entity102			0
' and i know another wise religious passage as well , ' let he who is without sin cast the first stone			0
' so let ’s not judge others ( and by others i mean me ) too harshly			0
all the best , @entity0 xxx			1
