the @entity1 government infiltrated @entity3 's hip hop scene in a botched attempt at overthrowing communist president @entity5 , a report has revealed			1
it came after failed efforts to develop a @entity10 version of @entity11 and exploding cigars			1
in a bid to ' break the information blockade ' and spark a youth movement against the government , the @entity13 spent two years targeting unwitting musicians who had shown themselves to be critical of @entity5 's administration , the @entity20 has learned			1
the scheme was masterminded by a @entity23 , - based contractor which employed a team of @entity26 key to the youth movement that overthrew former president @entity28 in 2000			1
but despite working so secretly that even the @entity30 was unaware , the operation was amateurish and profoundly unsuccessful			1
they also confiscated computer hardware , which in some cases contained information that endangered @entity10 who are thought to have had no idea they were caught up in the clandestine programme			1
ultimately , the plot compromised @entity3 's vibrant hip - hop culture which has produced some of the hardest - hitting grassroots criticism since @entity54 came to power in 1959			1
artists targeted by @entity13 for the scheme have been driven out of the country under pressure from the @entity10 government			1
the program is laid out in documents involving @entity63 , a @entity23 , contractor paid millions of dollars to undermine @entity3 's communist government			1
the thousands of pages include contracts , emails , preserved chats , budgets , expense reports , power points , photographs and passports			2
the work included the creation of a ' @entity10 @entity11 ' social network and the dispatch of inexperienced @entity80 youth to recruit activists , operations that were the focus of previous @entity20 stories			1
@entity13 denied the allegations on wednesday in a statement that read : ' any assertions that our work is secret or covert are simply false			1
' its programs , the statement added , were aimed at strengthening civil society ' often in places where civic engagement is suppressed and where people are harassed , arrested , subjected to physical harm or worse			2
' @entity63 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
danger : @entity33 ' @entity34 , left , and @entity32 , center , perform in concert at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity3			1
documents reveal an unaware @entity34 was detained during the operation scouted : the rappers were recruited for their critical lyrics in songs such as @entity3 ! at first , the hip - hop operation was run in @entity3 by @entity26 contractor @entity109			1
his project was inspired by the protest concerts of the student movement that helped undermine former @entity26 president @entity28 in 2000			1
nine years later , @entity109 headed public relations for @entity26 's @entity115 , an annual music event that had grown out of the student movement			1
@entity109 spoke to the @entity20 earlier this year but declined to talk about the @entity3 program			1
the @entity26 homed in swiftly on @entity33 , a hip - hop group frustrated by official pressure and widely respected by @entity10 youth for its hard - hitting lyrics			1
' people marching blind , you have no credibility , ' the group rapped in ' @entity3 ! ' ' go and tell the captain â€” this ship 's sinking rapidly			1
' @entity63 used a @entity130 front company and a bank in @entity132 to hide the money trail from @entity3 , where thousands of dollars went to fund a tv program starring @entity33			1
it would be distributed on dvds to circumvent @entity3 's censors			1
then the @entity138 rock star @entity137 announced a september 2009 concert in the heart of @entity102			0
creative managers held a two - day strategy session on how to persuade @entity137 to let @entity33 perform with him			0
it did n't happen , but @entity137 publicly thanked the rappers after the concert and was photographed with them			0
the contractors were pleased ; they believed this kind of public support by a major celebrity would protect @entity33 from state pressure			0
in a statement wednesday , a @entity137 spokesman , @entity150 , said that the concert had no political agenda and that ' @entity137 and the other organizing artists did not have any knowledge ' of what others did			2
later the month of the concert , @entity33 ' charismatic front man , @entity34 , was detained for illegal possession of a computer			2
@entity160 , who ran the program for @entity63 , saw the arrest as a ' perfect test ' of whether raising @entity34 's profile would keep out of jail			0
in the end , a relative of @entity34 's phoned @entity168 , himself a legendary singer			0
@entity32 , in an @entity20 interview in @entity102 , said he called a friend in @entity3 's @entity172 and asked for the computer to be returned			1
if there was a problem , he told the friend , ' tell them i gave them the computer as a present			0
' ' evidently he did what i said , ' @entity32 said			0
' i never imagined that a program like this could exist ... when you find out you could be surrounded by a conspiracy , it 's shocking			0
' at one point , the contractors approached a government sex education institute run by president @entity5 's daughter , @entity190 , to be part of the @entity115 in @entity26 , even as its organizers were running the @entity195 hip - hop operation			1
one contractor said it would be ' mind blowing ' to be working with the president 's family			0
@entity200 told the @entity20 that her institute sent two representatives to the festival but did n't build deeper ties because the festival ' did n't have anything to do with the work we were doing			0
' contractors paid $ 15,000 to underwrite an arts and music festival put on by the family of @entity213 , the famed singer of ' nueva trova ' music and a man with close government ties			0
mastermind : documents show @entity109 , a key member in the youth movement that overthrew @entity26 president @entity28 , was employed by a @entity23 , contractor to do the same in @entity3 scared : @entity10 musician @entity168 , a relative of @entity33 ' @entity34 , said they were all unaware of the operation and he had to persuade authorities to release @entity34 after he was detained their secret aim was to seed ' the minds of festival organizers with new ideas ' and persuade them to send ' high - impact messages ' to the audience , read one report			1
@entity235 ' daughter , @entity234 , said government officials showed up the day before the festival and warned her that she was associating with unsavory characters			0
they even showed her copies of @entity109 's emails , which they called suspicious , she recalled			0
her father declined to comment			0
clearly , @entity10 officials had figured out what was going on			2
@entity109 was detained coming into @entity102 with equipment , including a potentially incriminating memory stick , generating anxiety among the contractors			2
he cut his trip short and other contractors were told he would n't be returning soon			0
then , @entity10 authorities detained a photographer working with @entity254 , the only @entity10 who documents show knowingly worked for @entity63 on the hip - hop program			1
state security then interrogated @entity254 , a video jockey			0
he told @entity63 that the @entity10 authorities were worried about @entity109 and suspected links to the @entity260			2
four months later , @entity33 left @entity3 for their first trip off the island to perform at the exit festival in @entity26			1
on the side , they were the unwitting recipients of leadership training meant ' to focus them a little more on their role as agents of social mobilization , ' wrote @entity160 , a veteran of @entity10 pro-democracy efforts			2
shut down : contractors paid $ 15,000 to underwrite an arts and music festival put on by the family of @entity213 ( pictured ) , the famed singer of ' nueva trova ' music and a man with close government ties @entity254 was detained again returning to @entity102 in april 2011 , his computer and a memory stick seized			2
when they were returned , he realized they contained a document with the names of two @entity285 managers			0
it was a devastating blow			0
@entity254 and @entity287 did not respond to repeated requests for comment			0
@entity34 would only say that his ' conscience is clear			0
' while @entity109 spoke with @entity20 about his work with the exit festival , he did not respond to requests for comment on his @entity3 work			2
in august 2010 , @entity33 took the stage at @entity297 , one of @entity3 's largest independent music festivals			2
before a crowd of about 15,000 people , they lacerated government officials by name and taunted the police			0
' the police instead of making me hate them , inspire pity , because they are such sh --- eaters they do n't even realize they are victims of the system			2
@entity316 , ' @entity34 's partner rapped			0
within months , a @entity13 contractor told his handlers that the @entity10 said @entity13 had infiltrated the festival , and soon enough , the @entity10 took it over			1
. in the end , @entity33 moved to @entity321 after complaining that the @entity10 government made it impossible for them to work in their own country			2
their most recently published lyrics are softer - edged			0
in slickly produced videos , @entity34 plays with dogs and children , making only scattered political references as he raps about helping people love each other , and making the world a better place .			0

@entity13 spent two years backing @entity10 artists who were critical of @entity5
hoped to inspire youth movement that would overthrow communist leader
@entity26 *revolutionaries* were employed to scout artists and lure *listeners*
@entity344 was so secret the @entity30 did not know it was happening
but many involved were detained , artists have been driven out of @entity3
