by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 ’s five for 29 in @entity3 ’s 10 - wicket victory against @entity4 on wednesday is only the latest remarkable chapter in the story of an emerging talent that has seen @entity8 liken him to @entity10			1
while it may have been the dream of playing in @entity14 maroon that first inspired @entity1 as he grew up in @entity15 , @entity16 , it is now the lure of @entity18 that is calling			1
@entity1 was introduced to the game by his father , @entity20 , and would spend ‘ special ’ summer days watching the @entity21 at the island ’s @entity22			1
his sister @entity24 played hockey for @entity16 but cricket was @entity1 ’s passion			1
he tried to emulate @entity28 and @entity29 as a skinny child playing joyfully on the outfield during the lunch breaks and fondly recalls delivering throw - downs to @entity34			2
@entity1 attended @entity36 primary school and then @entity37 with the pop star @entity38 , but a pro-am cricket festival set his life on a completely different track			1
then and now : @entity1 after scoring 208 for @entity37 ( left ) and taking five wickets for @entity3 @entity45 lad : @entity1 ( far right middle row ) lines up with his team - mates at @entity49 flying high : @entity1 is elated after taking the prized wicket of @entity51 on wednesday he happened to play in a team captained by former @entity3 batsman @entity53 , who recognised his talent and selected him as only the second young @entity57 cricketer to profit from a scholarship programme at @entity49 , a prestigious independent school in south - east @entity59			1
@entity1 ’s mother @entity60 , a secretary at a @entity16 bank , had grown up in south @entity59			1
her son , a @entity64 passport holder , duly retraced his family roots 4,000 miles away in @entity3 ’s capital , spending a year at the boarding school in 2006 - 7 before settling in the city			1
‘ it was a huge step for a boy , coming from @entity16 to a big private school in @entity59 but he did it , ’ said @entity53			1
‘ he ’s a personable lad and he played football for the school as well , so he was well in with the other boys straight away			0
it was easy to see his talent but our scholarship students have to be academically strong as well , which @entity1 was			1
he could bat , bowl and field well in the deep or close to the wicket			0
there are very few with that genuine all - round ability			0
’ @entity1 ’s talent soon attracted the attention of @entity86 , too			2
@entity87 was the club ’s @entity88 coach and went to watch @entity1 at @entity91 ’s invitation			2
‘ i thought : “ @entity93 , this kid is pretty special ” , ’ said @entity87			0
‘ he was so raw			0
he ’d run in really hard from this long run - up and he could bowl very fast			2
when batting he could hit the ball hard but he was n’t quite the finished article			0
’ @entity1 ’s rawness , however , was what made him so special in @entity87 ’s eyes			2
pictures of him as a teenager reveal a baby - faced assassin and he played with a freedom and a childlike enjoyment that , thankfully , had not been coached out of him at an early age			2
his potential was evident for all to see			0
‘ i invited him for a 2nd team net and he impressed again , so we picked him in a 2nd @entity88 game , ’ added @entity87			0
‘ he took three or four wickets and scored about 20 runs so i called up @entity114 ( then @entity86 ’s @entity116 coach ) and said : “ you really have to have a look at this kid ”			0
he was in the @entity116 nets the next morning			0
‘ @entity1 was such a nice kid , always well - behaved and very respectful of his elders			1
we had a tour in @entity16 and he showed us all around			2
he was so well - mannered , even if he was full - on on the pitch			0
raw talent : @entity1 making a successful lbw appeal in an under - 15 match for @entity127 in the family : @entity1 's mother @entity60 ( centre ) grew up in south @entity59 and his sister @entity24 played hockey for @entity16 fast and fuious : @entity1 steamed in and took five @entity134 wickets for 29 runs ‘ @entity1 was one of those kids that make you think : “ i ’m so glad he ’s made it ”			1
’ former @entity3 captain @entity8 was another impressed by @entity1 ’s natural ability , even if ‘ @entity1 ’ is a @entity143 supporter who took a lot of stick from this staunch @entity147 fan			1
‘ @entity1 was the best young talent i had seen since @entity150 , ’ @entity8 told @entity148			2
‘ they are very different cricketers , but you could just tell @entity1 was going to be a superstar			2
he made everything look so easy			0
‘ it ’s a big shout but i likened him to a young , poor man ’s @entity10 , who was the greatest bowler i ever played against			0
‘ i ’m not saying @entity1 will get that close but he ’s a quick bowler who can swing the ball out and a fine fielder as well — a very good slip with a good head on his young shoulders			1
’ former @entity21 captain sir @entity165 was also struck by @entity1 ’s talent during a match at @entity168 in 2007			1
when he realised the fast bowler was @entity16 - born , he asked @entity170 for @entity1 ’s telephone number , only to be referred to the @entity86 captain ’s father , who duly stalled and tried to put @entity165 off			1
@entity174 , @entity165 asked after @entity1 again when he saw @entity114 at a function that winter , but was told : ‘ sorry , @entity165 , too late			1
we ’ve nicked him ! ’ @entity1 seized his opportunity in @entity3 by joining @entity86 aged 17 but , six years , 1,044 runs and 97 wickets later he was released by the county side			1
a once - promising career looked as if it might remain unfulfilled after @entity1 missed the whole of the 2010 season with a ‘ horrific ’ back injury and then struggled to adjust his bowling action			1
running the show : @entity189 careers off after having @entity190 caught behind @entity191 , chairman of @entity86 , said : ‘ @entity1 was given plenty of exposure to the first team and he was well thought of but , when he was with us , he suffered a horrific back injury - a stress fracture - which ruled him out for the whole of 2010			1
‘ every man and his dog had a go at diagnosing the problem			0
when he came back he had to remodel his bowling action and it took time for him to find his rhythm			0
‘ it did n’t work for him and he needed a change of environment			0
he left in 2012 after six years with us and he went to @entity209 where @entity210 has done a brilliant job with him			0
‘ there is no side to @entity1 , no edge			2
now he has made a huge impact with @entity3 and it is wonderful to see			2
’ @entity8 also speaks of @entity189 with considerable fondness , backing him to become a mainstay of the @entity219 , one - day and test teams , even if he is no longer wearing @entity86 colours domestically			0
he added : ‘ @entity1 had some injuries which may not have been diagnosed straightaway and then , later on in his @entity86 career , his statistics did n’t back up his talent when he did get an opportunity			1
but i still believed he was going to be a top - class cricketer			0
‘ i rang @entity210 at @entity209 and @entity230 at @entity231 and said : “ he ’s something very , very special			0
take him on board because i still believe in him ”			0
pumped up : @entity1 celebrates the wicket of @entity235 as @entity4 collapse at @entity237 worthy acclaim : @entity1 ( centre ) salutes the crowd as his team - mates give him a round of applause ‘ people are allowed time to mature and you should always judge people in adversity			1
when you have little setbacks the great ones come through stronger			0
i ’m very , very pleased to see what he ’s achieved			0
’ former @entity254 fast bowler @entity253 noted @entity1 ’s ‘ serious raw pace ’ and predicted he is ‘ destined to get a lot of wickets ’ after watching him perform in @entity257 earlier this year			1
it was a one - day match that featured @entity1 ’s stunning catch off his own bowling to take the wicket of @entity263			1
@entity3 bowling coach @entity264 has also heralded @entity1 as the ‘ ultimate professional ’ , while captain @entity266 has been impressed by the way the 6ft 2in bowler has taken everything in his stride			1
there is a sense of desperation to find an instant hero at a time of flux in @entity45 cricket , but @entity1 ’s performances so far this summer have suggested this very raw talent can step up and roar for years to come			2
‘ what i like about him is his attitude , ’ said @entity266			0
‘ he has n’t changed at all since the first day he walked into the changing room			0
he ’s desperate to do well , and he ’s got a hell of a lot of talent as well			0
