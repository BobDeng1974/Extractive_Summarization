by @entity0 the family of a schoolboy left brain damaged after an asthma attack have spoken out to warn others of the devastation the condition can cause			1
@entity7 , 11 , had lived with the ' routine ' condition all his life with no previous complications			1
but his family 's life was turned upside down after he suffered a near - fatal attack on the short walk home from school			1
tragic : @entity7 has been left brain damaged after an asthma attack			1
his father @entity19 ( pictured ) says his son 's condition was always ' well controlled ' as a team at @entity25 's @entity24 later battled to bring his condition under control , the youngster suffered a panic attack before later going into cardiac arrest - during which a medical team battled for 14 minutes to revive him			1
the terrifying ordeal - which happened as his parents @entity19 and @entity33 could only watch helplessly - left the schoolboy from @entity36 , near @entity25 , with debilitating injuries due to a lack of oxygen			2
since the asthma attack on january 31 , he has spent three weeks in intensive care at the @entity42 of @entity43 , a further week on the high dependency unit , and has been at the @entity46 's @entity45 in @entity47 ever since			1
his parents , who have barely left his bedside since he first fell ill , say their son faces a long road of rehabilitation and therapy			0
they have also had to come to terms with the fact their son - as they used to know him - has gone for good			0
@entity7 's father @entity19 , 44 , said : ' he has always suffered with asthma and it was under control			1
' well controlled ' : @entity7 , 11 , had lived with the ' routine ' condition all his life with no previous complications and took his medication regularly ' he was under a consultant and he was really pleased with him			1
in fact , the week before this happened we had discussed the possibility of him being discharged from his regular check - ups because we were worried about him missing school			0
' the day it happened was just a normal day - he went to school ' he rang my wife at about 1pm saying he felt a bit ill			1
she said she finished work at 2pm and , if he still felt ill , to call her and she would pick him up			2
' she never heard from him , so presumed he was okay			0
but when school finished , he phoned to say he was feeling unwell , his chest was tight and that he 'd run out of his inhlaer			0
' the school is only a short walk from our home , but by the time my wife got to him in the car , he was practically sat on the floor struggling to breathe			0
' she knew straight away it was bad , so she took him to the nearby surgery where she works			0
' @entity7 was put on a nebuliser ( a machine that delivers asthma drugs ) but when it had little effect , he was rushed to hospital in @entity25			1
emergency : during the asthma attack , @entity7 went into cardiac arrest			1
he was clinically dead for 14 minutes and his brain was starved of oxygen his father added : ' they tried back - to - back nebulisers and an injection in to the vein , but nothing worked			1
' by 11.30pm , with his condition failing to improve , an intensive care team was called in to transfer him to @entity47			0
but to his family 's horror , he went into cardiac arrest and it took a further five hours to stabilise the youngster before he could be transferred			1
by then , then the attack had had life - changing consequences for @entity7			1
during a cardiac arrest , the blood supply to the vital organs - including the brain - stops			1
if oxygenated blood does not get to the brain , there will be neurological damage , which is what happened to @entity7			1
his father said : ' he 's communicating by blinking and making noises , but we hope that one dayhe will get his speech back			0
' the only way i can explain it is that he 's the same boy with the same memories and sense of humour , but he 's trapped in a body that he ca n't move and he ca n't talk			2
' battle : @entity7 's brain damage means he can now only communicate by blinking and making noises			2
his father @entity19 said : ' he 's the same boy with the same memories and sense of humour , but he 's trapped in a body that he ca n't move ' a team of brain injury specialists from @entity143 , @entity144 , were due to assess the youngster this week and his parents and older sister @entity147 , 18 , are hopeful he will eventually regain some mobility and speech			0
but they are preparing themselves for a long and difficult road ahead			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it 's totally turned our lives upside down			2
our daughter 's been absolutely fantastic and is trying to be so strong , but we do n't have any quality time with her			0
' the worst bit is that it 's so hard to believe that in this day and age that asthma can be so devastating			2
' @entity7 was just a normal boy who loved his sport , @entity161 and fishing			2
but then he was so close to dying			0
in fact , he was clinically dead for 14 minutes			1
' the family made the difficult decision to share their story in the same week as the @entity168 claimed people in the @entity170 are dying unnecessarily as a result of complacency on the part of both medical professionals and asthma sufferers			0
the study found the @entity170 has some of the highest asthma death rates in @entity178 and the @entity180 family are determined to do all they can to improve understanding of the condition			2
fight : medics at @entity25 's @entity24 ( pictured ) had battled to bring @entity7 's condition under control , but he continued to deteriorate mr @entity7 said : ' there definitely needs to be more awareness , especially among @entity189 think they are bomb - proof			1
' we 've had times with @entity7 where we 'd say " have you taken your pump [ inhaler ] ? " and he 'd say " yes "			2
' we 'd say " are you sure ? " and then he 'd take it			0
' but he was generally really good with it , and this happened to him			0
on the day it happened he had done everything right , he 'd taken his medication as planned			0
' people think it 's so routine , but it can turn in an instant and once it gets so far you are in real trouble			0
