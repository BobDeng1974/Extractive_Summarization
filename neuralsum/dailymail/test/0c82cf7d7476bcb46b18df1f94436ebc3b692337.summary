you might think opting for a salad or sandwich for lunch will see you on your way to a healthy lifestyle			0
but in fact sandwiches and pasta salads can contain more fat , calories and sugar than burgers and pizzas			0
some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of @entity17 ’s , @entity18 and @entity19 , researchers have found			1
meanwhile a @entity34 sandwich contains 694 calories and 37.1g of fat – but a @entity37 pizza has 683 calories and contains only 22.5g of fat			0
and a 624 - calorie @entity40 and @entity41 from @entity42 comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518 - calorie @entity44 with cheese			1
consumer group which ? , which conducted the research , said it was surprised to find that three of the sandwiches it surveyed contained more than three teaspoons of sugar			0
these included @entity54 ’s @entity53 and @entity55 on @entity56 , which contains 17.6g of sugar – equivalent to more than four teaspoons			0
which ? added it was easy for customers to overeat at lunchtime , with dishes such as @entity62 and @entity63 , which states it contains seven servings , often eaten by one person – meaning they consume 683 calories and 38.6g of fat in one sitting			0
this is more than @entity18 ’s @entity71 , which has 648 calories and 37.2g of fat			1
which ? said its research proves all food suppliers need to adopt the traffic light labelling system , which flags up levels of calories , fat , sugar and salt , to help consumers cut through the confusion and find healthy lunch options			2
a 624 - calorie @entity40 and @entity86 from @entity42 comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518 - calorie @entity44 with cheese the system is voluntary and many stores opt not to use it			1
a which ? spokesman said : ‘ we ’ve uncovered sandwiches and salads that contain more calories and fat than a @entity98 ‘ given our research , it ’s perhaps not surprising that two thirds of @entity103 adults and a third of children are classed as overweight or obese			1
