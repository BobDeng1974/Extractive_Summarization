the woolly mammoth became extinct as a result of crippling bone disease that left them unable to fend off predators , according to startling new evidence from @entity6			1
it was previously thought that the hairy beast simply died out from @entity10 climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man			0
but now a new theory is set to re-write the history books after the examination of more than 23,500 mammoth bones found them riddled with osteoporosis and lacking in calcium			1
dr @entity20 , the head of the laboratory of @entity23 and @entity24 continental eco-systems , said : ' in some collections that we examined almost 100 per cent of the bones ( pictured ) had signs of osteoporosis ' the major mineral deficiency - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in them breaking their limbs and spines , and left them unable to walk			1
in turn it meant the giant animal , which stood 10ft ( three metres ) high , eventually collapsed to the ground and could not forage for food , or flee hunters			1
according to the @entity45 , the new evidence was uncovered by dr @entity20 , from @entity47			0
he spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths that roamed western @entity52 and @entity6 between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago			1
until now it was thought that the woolly mammoth simply died out from @entity10 climate change and being hunted to extinction by early man ( analysis of bones at mammoth ' graveyard ' pictured ) one mammoth graveyard where many bones have been found is in @entity63 , @entity6 shown is a young mammoth jaw riddled with bone disease			1
according to the @entity45 , the new evidence was uncovered by dr @entity20 , from @entity47 the deficiency in calcium - which came from the impact of rising temperatures on soil and water - resulted in mammoths breaking their bones ( example pictured ) limbs and spines , leaving them unable to walk since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths			1
all but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago			0
one popular theory , bolstered by this study , is that @entity85 people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence			1
however , some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago			0
other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in @entity94 13,000 years ago , led to rapid climate change , eventually wiping out the mammoths			1
today , it 's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction			0
but now a new theory - osteoperosis - might need to be added to the list			1
dr @entity20 , the head of the laboratory of @entity23 and @entity24 continental eco-systems , said : ' in some collections that we examined , almost 100 per cent of the bones had signs of osteoporosis			2
' obviously , this led to a high traumatism among animals , such as sprains and fractures because of the smallest loads			2
' mammoths with damaged limbs or spines could not find food in sufficient quantities and lost the ability to follow the herd			2
' those who lagged behind the herd quickly became the prey of predators			0
' roughly the same size as a modern @entity130 elephant , the woolly mammoth is widely thought to have become extinct as a direct result of climate change			2
most experts say warming temperatures - twinned with rising sea levels - following the last @entity85 all but wiped out their traditional habitats about 20,000 years ago			0
however , others say they lived long past this era and were finally hunted to death by early humans , with remains found in the @entity6 @entity142 showing they existed just 3,700 years ago			1
now the scientific world will be excited by the emerging evidence that bone disease , and a chronic lack of calcium , could instead be to blame			0
shown left and right are mammoth statues in @entity151			0
the research , if proven true , would provide a somewhat unusual explanation for how woolly mammoths died out experts spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths ( ' graveyard ' pictured ) that roamed western @entity52 and @entity6 between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago dr @entity20 , who wrote about his findings in the @entity164 journal , added : ' the articular surfaces of the limb bones in some specimens were not just damaged , they were mutilated with disease			1
' the most typical signs were osteoporosis , osteofibrosis , osteomalacia , osteolysis , cartilage atrophy and fractures resulting in the formation of false joints , ulcers and friction grooves			0
' the palaeontologist said that in his opinion the cause of the deaths was a metabolic disorder caused by mineral starvation			0
it is thought that mammoths did try to make up for their calcium shortfall by eating clay on the waterfronts or in mud baths , but it was not in sufficient quantities to strengthen bones			2
often dubbed the ' old person 's disease ' in humans osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones and makes them fragile and more likely to break			2
it affects about three million people in the @entity202 and one in 10 receives hospital treatment for fractures from falling down .			0

mammoth bones found in @entity6 **suggest** new theory for their demise
a major mineral deficiency was found in the 23,500 - year - old bones
**suggest** mammoths may have been riddled with osteoporosis
animals would have eventually collapsed to the ground under own *weight*
