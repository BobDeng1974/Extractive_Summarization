by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:52 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 18:19 est , 16 may 2013 @entity2 was accused yesterday of ‘ doing evil ’ by avoiding @entity5 taxes			1
mps said the internet search giant – which has the informal motto ‘ do n’t be evil ’ – used ‘ devious , calculated and unethical ’ tricks to minimise its liabilities			0
last year its @entity5 turnover was £ 3billion yet it paid just £ 7.3million in corporation tax			1
in stark contrast , families lose more than half of their wages to income tax and national insurance			0
@entity2 vice president @entity19 floundered during the grilling by @entity6 , admitting that committee chairman @entity21 knew more about his firm than he did during heated questioning in the @entity25 yesterday , @entity23 mp @entity21 asked @entity2 executives : ‘ if you are a hard - pressed family who pay all their taxes , or if you are a struggling business who feel very bullied by @entity32 and certainly hassled by them , how do you think they feel ? ‘ every time they switch on to @entity2 ... it reminds them of your rather devious , if i may say so , calculated and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the common good ? how do you think ordinary people feel ? ’ referring to the ‘ do n’t be evil ’ slogan , mrs @entity21 added : ‘ i think you do do evil			1
that is , you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax			2
’ @entity19 , a vice-president of @entity2 , had been summoned by mps for a second time to give evidence			2
he was accused of trying to ‘ disguise ’ the truth with the testimony he gave last november			0
@entity2 claims all its sales are made in @entity56 , rather than in the @entity5			1
this allows the firm to pay tax in @entity60 , which has a corporation tax rate of just 12.5 per cent against @entity5 ’s 23 per cent			1
mr @entity19 told @entity6 last november : ‘ no one in the @entity5 is selling			2
’ furious : committee chairman @entity21 warned mr @entity64 that misleading @entity65 was a ' very serious offence ' as she accused him of being ' devious ' during more than an hour of intense questions , exasperated mps called on mr @entity64 to ' call a spade a spade ' and give straight answers to their questions but @entity6 said new evidence suggests almost 70 per cent of @entity2 ’s sales revenues come from deals that have involved @entity5 staff			1
those staff are largely paid by commission and have monthly ‘ sales ’ targets – suggesting they are in fact selling in the @entity5			1
mps said they had been contacted by a ‘ stream of whistleblowers ’ and had seen invoices sent out from @entity5 addresses			0
mrs @entity21 , who chairs the public accounts committee , said she had seen a presentation given to @entity5 staff giving sales targets for 2012			1
‘ it was quite clear from all that documentation that the entire trading process and sales process took place in the @entity5 , ’ she said			2
during a two - hour interrogation , mr @entity19 eventually admitted that ‘ a lot of the aspects of selling ’ do take place in the @entity5			0
but he insisted all sales were processed and billed in @entity60			1
he said : ‘ literally 99 per cent of our @entity5 customers spend their money without ever talking to anyone in @entity2 @entity5			1
’ but the remaining 1 per cent are the group ’s largest customers , and account for more than two thirds of its total sales			0
labour leader @entity112 said people would be ' shocked ' by @entity2 's tax arrangements while business secretary @entity115 said ' public outrage ' was justified he added : ‘ customers may feel they are being sold to ... but there ’s a difference between that and closing the deals and money changing hands			1
’ @entity125 mp @entity124 told mr @entity19 : ‘ they thought they were being sold to , because they were			0
why do n’t you call a spade a spade ? ’ when mrs @entity21 accused @entity2 of being ‘ evil ’ , mr @entity19 said : ‘ tax is not a matter of choice			2
tax is a matter of following the laws that are there internationally and that is what we do			0
’ yesterday business secretary @entity115 accused @entity2 of being ‘ amoral ’			1
he said : ‘ if you are a small company which ca n’t relocate overseas and has to pay a lot of tax , i can understand why people are absolutely furious			0
‘ they ’re looking for us in government , quite rightly , to close any loopholes , but , more important , we ’ve got to get a proper system of international rules so that people are operating in a consistent way across national boundaries			0
’ during one farcical exchange , @entity157 ( @entity158 ) from accountants @entity159 , refused to talk about @entity2 's tax arrangements to protect client ' confidentiality ' despite sitting next to his client a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ as we have always said , we fully comply with all of the tax rules in the @entity5			1
‘ we stand behind @entity19 ’s testimony over the course of two sessions in front of @entity65 , and we disagree with the committee ’s view of our tax structure			0
’ @entity175 , chief executive of @entity32 , who also gave evidence , said she sympathised with the widespread public outrage at the low taxes paid by many corporations			2
the row comes amid growing unease over the sweetheart deals agreed between @entity32 and big companies			0
yesterday , @entity185 lost its @entity187 battle against @entity188 , which the campaign group claimed had been let off a £ 20million tax bill			0
but , while ruling that the deal was not unlawful , mr @entity191 said ‘ the settlement with @entity188 was not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue ’ .			0

@entity2 vice president @entity64 *challenged* over complex tax set up
he insisted all sales are made in @entity60 so tax is paid there not in @entity5
@entity115 slams legal but unethical behaviour to avoid tax
last year firm paid only £ 7.3million in corporation tax on more than £ 3billion @entity5 sales
@entity32 says without a change in the law ' we can not *collect* the tax '
labour leader @entity112 accuses firm of ' going to *extraordinary* *lengths* ' to dodge tax
