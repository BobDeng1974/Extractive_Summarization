the @entity1 epidemic devastating parts of @entity3 will have killed tens of thousands of people by the middle of december unless urgent action is taken			1
in a report published today , scientists warn the window of opportunity to control the outbreak is ' rapidly closing '			0
as a result , there could be ' calamitous repercussions ' , unless international efforts to control the disease are substantially increased			1

scientists have warn that tens of thousands more will die unless international efforts to control the virus are increased a carpenter makes new caskets for sale in @entity29 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
even as @entity32 get sick and die of @entity1 , many beds in treatment centres are empty because of the government 's order that the bodies of all suspected @entity1 victims be cremated			2
today scientists called for more beds to treat @entity1 sufferers a team of @entity42 researchers used mathematical modelling to predict infection rates in @entity23 's most populated county , @entity46			1
they calculated that without extra help , as many as 171,000 people could succumb to @entity1 by december 15 , representing 12 per cent of an overall population of some 1.38 million			2
in @entity46 alone , there could be more than 90,000 deaths by that time , many of them unreported			1
a single infected individual could pass on the infection to an average of 2.49 people in @entity46 , the researchers calculated			1
lead researcher professor @entity60 , from the @entity58 at @entity59 , said : ' our predictions highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of new @entity1 cases and deaths in the coming months			0
' although we might still be within the midst of what will ultimately be viewed as the early phase of the current outbreak , the possibility of averting calamitous repercussions from an initially delayed and insufficient response is quickly eroding			0
' the news comes as the @entity78 's emergency committee decided screening passengers for @entity1 may have a ' limited effect ' in stopping the spread of the virus			0

today scientists warned a single infected individual could pass on the infection to an average of 2.49 people the committee warned that ' resource demands may be significant ' when screening incoming passengers , but that it is up to individual governments to decide whether the measure is necessary			1
passengers are already screened as they leave @entity23 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
writing in the journal @entity102 , the researchers today warned some 97,940 cases of the disease could be averted if the international community stepped up control measures immediately , starting from october 31 , according to their model			1
this would require more @entity1 treatment beds , a five-fold increase in the speed at which new cases are detected , and the allocation of protective kits to households of patients awaiting admission to clinics			1
at best , just over 53,957 cases could be prevented if interventions are delayed until november 15 , said the researchers			0
health workers carry the body of a @entity32 woman suspected of contracting ebola virus			0
experts said today the ' current global health strategy is woefully inadequate to stop the current volatile @entity1 epidemic ' around 9,000 @entity1 cases and 4,500 deaths have been reported in @entity23 , @entity98 and @entity99 since the outbreak began in december last year			1
health workers in the @entity42 , @entity133 and @entity134 have been infected after being exposed to the virus in @entity3			0
there are fears of the disease spreading from @entity3 to other parts of the world despite restrictions at air and sea ports			0
of the five @entity147 countries originally affected by the outbreak , @entity144 and @entity145 have now been declared @entity1 - free			0
co-author professor @entity149 , also from @entity59 , said : ' the current global health strategy is woefully inadequate to stop the current volatile @entity1 epidemic			0
' at a minimum , capable logisticians are needed to construct a sufficient number of ebola treatment units in order to avoid the unnecessary deaths of tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of people			2

this is unless international efforts to control virus are increased
researchers used mathematical modelling to predict infection rates
@entity23 's most populated county could see 90,000 deaths by december
single infected individual in the county could pass on infection to *2.5* people
introducing controls by october 31 could avert 97,940 cases of the disease
experts called for more treatment beds and more protective kits
also want a five-fold increase in the speed at which new cases are detected
