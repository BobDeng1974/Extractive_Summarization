’ @entity12 declined to comment			0
by @entity202 justice demand : @entity62 mp @entity61 a @entity62 mp says he is considering the sensational step of publicly naming an influential politician who allegedly abused boys at @entity11			1
@entity61 , who exposed former @entity207 mp @entity27 , said he would use parliamentary privilege – giving him legal immunity – to unmask someone ‘ much more important ’			1
‘ i have used privilege before and i would consider using privilege to name the @entity216 , ’ he said yesterday.rochdale mp mr @entity61 published a book last week detailing how @entity27 , who died in 2010 , abused hundreds of vulnerable boys over four decades			1
unlike @entity27 , the politician he is now considering naming is still sitting in @entity218			2
calling for a new in - depth inquiry into the activities at @entity221 , which closed in 1982 , mr @entity61 said : ‘ there is undoubtedly a cover - up			2
‘ this is n’t just about @entity27 , this is a much wider network of paedophiles , people who were abusing youngsters			2
