by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 17 september 2012 every driver in @entity2 knows it is an offence to use a mobile phone while travelling along the highway			1
so at first it might be wondered why @entity7 is upset about being pulled over by a traffic cop while he was on the phone			2
but the reason for his frown when the police officer told him he was being booked was perhaps understandable – because mr @entity7 was sitting on a cart being pulled along by his @entity14 at the time			1
@entity16 bother : mr @entity7 was talking on his mobile phone whilst steering a carriage drawn by his horse toffee ( picture unrelated ) he was flabbergasted when he was issued with an on - the - spot fine for $ 250 ( £ 163 ) for using his phone while in charge of a vehicle			1
mr @entity7 , who runs @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity2 , told the @entity26 , that he had been travelling all around @entity25 in the wagon trail business for years and he ’d always used his mobile phone while on the road			1
‘ i thought that a horse - drawn vehicle was ok , ’ he said			2
in fact it was – under an old law			2
section 265 of the @entity34 relating to use of mobile phones was changed in march 2011 from ‘ using a mobile phone while driving a motor vehicle ’ to ‘ using a mobile phone while driving a vehicle '			1
nicked : mr @entity7 was fined by police on a highway near the city of @entity25 , @entity2 ‘ i was only travelling at 2kph ’ he said , when nine - year - old toffee pulling his cart along			1
he and @entity45 had been travelling along the same route for the past four years and he suggested the horse could ‘ probably do it on her own			0
’ mr @entity7 , 56 , said he reluctantly accepted the ticket but he is now seeking legal advice on whether he should contest his booking			1
‘ the law is the law and if i do n’t know the law , that ’s bad luck			0
however , there has to be some common sense			0
’ a ‘ reasonable man ’ he said , would have pulled him over and issued a verbal warning			0
‘ there ’s no such thing as community policing any more , ’ he told the newspaper			0
‘ it ’s pure revenue raising , that ’s all this is , ’ he said			0
‘ the least the policeman could have done is warn me the law had changed			0
’ he added : ‘ if police want to be respected they should respect the public and use common sense , too			0

@entity7 was on the phone on a highway in @entity25 , @entity2
@entity81 law bans using mobile phones whilst driving vehicles - but only if they are motorised
mr @entity7 is *planning* on contesting the fine
