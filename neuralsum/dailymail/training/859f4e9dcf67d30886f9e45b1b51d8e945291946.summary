by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 00:25 est , 6 september 2012 religious headliner : rabbi @entity2 , who head 's @entity4 ' @entity3 , has known @entity7 and her family for decades @entity7 's former rabbi who publicly condemned @entity10 during the sex scandal gave the benediction minutes after the former president took the stage at the @entity15 tonight			1
@entity16 reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because rabbi @entity2 is such a well - known figure in the @entity21 community			2
@entity22 may not have healed all wounds , however , as rabbi @entity2 was very critical of mr @entity10 throughout the scandal and wrote an op - ed three years ago reiterating those feelings			1
the @entity27 attended the @entity2 's @entity3 in @entity4 for years and @entity7 went to its affiliated @entity3 religious school before heading to college , and eventually , the @entity30			0
as the then - 22 - year - old intern 's name became a national buzzword for having repeated sexual encounters with the then - president , her @entity2 came to her defense and criticized mr @entity10			1
' he was a brilliant , talented , extraordinary child , and for the leader of the @entity40 we need an adult , ' the @entity37 reported rabbi @entity2 saying in a synagogue service around the time of the 1998 scandal			1
that ferocity dimmed slightly in the following decade , but it did n't disappear completely			0
in a column about another politician 's affair , rabbi @entity2 brought up @entity10 again saying that it was more the cover up and slander that brought the disgrace with that instance			1
former fling : president @entity10 , seen here in august , was impeached over his affair with then - 22 - year - old intern @entity7 ( right ) while he was in office the affair : @entity58 and @entity10 , seen hugging in 1996 , had nine sexual encounters that did not involve intercourse ' during the @entity7 scandal , it was the lying and smearing of @entity7 that marked the low point of the event , not the sex , which was primarily an issue for the individuals and families involved , ' he wrote in the @entity69			2
mr @entity10 spent the years following his two terms working with his philanthropic organization the @entity71 , writing his autobiography , and accruing goodwill			0
in june of this year , the former president had a 66 per cent favorability rating which was certainly higher than president @entity76 's			0
by granting @entity10 the coveted second - night - headlining post at the @entity15 , it shows that @entity76 sees the value in having his predecessor in a prominent spot to attract undecideds			2
keep moving : president @entity76 arrived in @entity83 , @entity84 on wednesday and is expected to attend the convention tonight before speaking on thursday military arrival : the theme of caring for military families was a present one in tuesday night 's speeches , and in keeping with that , the president arrived at the @entity93 base while @entity10 's speech - which he is said to have written himself - will be an attack on the @entity99 , asserting that ' they built ' the country 's $ 16trillion national debt , the topic of @entity15 support for @entity96 has aleady been raised today			1
during the day on wednesday , delegates approved revisions to the convention platform to include a mention of @entity107 and declared @entity108 to be the capital of @entity96			0
considering president @entity76 has been criticized for what many @entity21 supporters view as tepid support for @entity96 , the move was undoubtedly seen as a strong show of allegiance			0
the same goes for the decision to give rabbi @entity2 such a prominent position in the convention schedule , though it may end up being an awkward selection in the end			2
taking the stage : @entity76 headlined on tuesday and former president @entity10 will take the stage in @entity83 , @entity84 wednesday			0

rabbi @entity2 has known the @entity124 for years and criticized @entity10 during the scandal
is *booked* to speak before the former president at @entity15 on wednesday
