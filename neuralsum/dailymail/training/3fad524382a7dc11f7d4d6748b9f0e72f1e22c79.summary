by @entity0 published : 21:22 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 04:08 est , 23 july 2013 biopics have a gruesome obsession with the decay of stardom			1
we ’ve seen it too many times in recent dramas — @entity9 in @entity10 , for example , depicting an aged @entity12 wracked by dementia			1
the love affair between @entity15 and @entity16 was the romance of the century			1
they burned like phosphorus together , with an intensity that made other lives seem feeble glimmers			1
with the release last year of @entity16 ’s candid , vivid diaries , it ’s a story that was begging to be told on screen			1
@entity27 and @entity28 as @entity16 and @entity15 so why did @entity29 ( @entity30 ) focus on the final sputterings of their great passion , when they met to play @entity36 ’s private lives on @entity37 ? @entity15 , the @entity38 child star from @entity39 , was a bloated wreck in 1983 , addicted to pills and booze			1
@entity16 , the son of a @entity44 miner , was less than a year from death , crippled by pain and hollowed out by alcoholism			1
there ’s a story here — how @entity15 , insecure at 50 and yearning for past glories , engineered a reunion with @entity16 on stage , in the hope their love would be rekindled and they could marry each other for a third time			1
but it ’s a footnote , an epilogue to the epic feature of their love			1
the parties , the screaming rows , the jewellery , the breakdowns — we saw none of it , until the closing minutes of this drama			1
and that scene , with the couple doing a drunken keep fit routine to the strains of @entity78 before falling into bed , outshone everything that had come before			1
the couple had a tempestuous booze - fuelled relationship and remarried after their first marriage ended this production looked lavish			1
and @entity27 did her considerable best — there ’s a seam of insanity that glitters in her acting , whether she ’s playing a villainess in @entity92 or a heartless swindler in @entity94			2
as @entity15 , she seemed to make the madness external , to wrap herself in it			2
at the core was a lonely , middle - aged woman , swaddled in the trappings of stardom : the venomous personal assistants , the packs of lap - dogs , the parrot called @entity105 that travelled everywhere with her			2
@entity27 caught the husky drawl and the bored manner to perfection			2
she looked more like @entity110 but that did n’t matter : this was a performance , not an impression			2
@entity28 fell far short , however			2
he looked like a much younger @entity16 — in 1983 , the great actor was jowly and raddled , ripe for the stroke that killed him			2
but @entity28 sounded like @entity117 , and he exuded none of the menace , thunder or charisma that had bewitched audiences			2
at times he looked more like an accountant than a @entity124			0
the script , by @entity126 , had strong lines that conjured up the aggressive banter between the couple			0
@entity16 , trying to sleep off a hangover while his ex-wife flirted girlishly with him , growled : ‘ @entity15 , i swear to @entity135 , if you do n’t stop talking , i ’m going to climb out of this bed and drive back to the @entity131 in my bloody underpants			0
’ homage of the week : in his tv sitcom more than 50 years ago , @entity138 did a send - up of the radio series @entity142 where he spent five minutes pretending to die — noisily , hammily and shamelessly			0
count @entity143 ( @entity144 ) had the sheer chutzpah to reprise the gag			0
that took some nerve ! but there was a time in their lives when he would have done exactly what he threatened			0
that ’s what this drama lacked : the colossal flamboyance of @entity16 and @entity15 when they were gods			0
at least they ’re still stars			0
everyone knows who they are			0
by contrast , @entity163 ’s new quiz show , @entity164 , did n’t have a clue what it was or how it wanted to be			1
the set looked like @entity170 , the music sounded like a cross between @entity172 and dr who , the contestants seemed to think they were playing blockbusters and the final round was stolen straight from @entity178			0
the central concept was good : players have to answer general knowledge questions fast enough to keep six egg timers from running out			0
every correct answer means they can turn one timer over : hence the @entity186 in the title			1
it might evolve to be good viewing , if the faults are ironed out			0
but in this opening edition , much of the format did n’t work , and the show had a runaway winner before it was halfway through			0
it ’s hard to keep watching a long , gruelling ending			0
and that ’s as true of quizzes as of biopics .			0
