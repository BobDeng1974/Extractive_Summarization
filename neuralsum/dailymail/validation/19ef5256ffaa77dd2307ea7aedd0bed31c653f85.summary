coroner mr @entity54 reached a verdict of suicide			0
he said : ' it is my conclusion that he did deliberately take himself out of the window and sadly ended up on the ground below having jumped from the 10th floor			1
' this could never have been a cry for help			0
he must have realised that by jumping out of there , there was only one result and that would have been his death			2
' a police officer who responded to the incident spoke of her shock at having to try to stop university students taking photos , the inquest heard			1

window tampered with : an inquest heard that the window 's lock ( appartment block pictured , left ) had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully ' the location was very prominent			2
i was concerned for the onlookers ' wellbeing and the casualty 's dignity			0
i could see a lot of people were watching from their windows			0
' i shouted for people to move away from the windows and close their curtains			0
i was shocked to see cameras flashing as people then took pictures and video			2
' i was worried pictures might appear on social media before we had time to inform the family so i shouted again for people to go inside			2
' mr @entity0 had been in a relationship with ms @entity27 for a year and four months			1
she told the @entity3 inquest : ' i asked if we could have a break but he just pestered me constantly			1
devastated after break - up : in the days leading up to his death , mr @entity0 was drinking heavily and had asked other residents in his accommodation block if he should kill himself ' the weekend before he died i told him i did n't want a relationship , i wanted to focus on my exams			1
' we were both upset , he said something like " my life is n't worth living " and he had said before " if we ever break up i will kill myself " but i thought it was just words			1
' he bombarded me with messages on text , @entity142 and @entity143			0
he sent me photos taken out of his bedroom window and one showing him with a noose round his neck			2

wrote ' goodbye ' notes : the 20 - year - old psychology student left messages to his parents and to his ex-girlfriend before ending his own life his housemate @entity162 told the inquest mr @entity0 had been drinking frequently in the days before his death but they assumed that was just his way of dealing with the relationship break - up			1

when another housemate went to the kitchen 30 minutes later the lights were on and the window was open			0
the inquest heard the windows were only supposed to tilt open at the top for safety but students had bought keys on the internet to override the locking system so they could fully open the window to smoke			2
two notes were found on mr @entity0 's desk - one addressed to his parents and one to @entity188			1
coroner mr sheriff @entity54 said the letter to his parents was clearly a ' goodbye ' note			0

after an inquest into the death , a verdict of suicide was recorded at @entity48 , above mr @entity54 said : ' he was upset about the end of his relationship and it 's clear he had difficulty accepting it			2
' no one actually perceived that he was planning to end his life			0
he made no declaration to his housemates and his family had been in contact with him and they did not have any serious concerns for his welfare			0
