but @entity11 has directed a furious broadside at @entity14 ’s ‘ townies ’ , whom he claims are ignorant of countryside issues and should be tested on rural affairs before being allowed to vote			1
the former @entity2 captain said there should be ‘ compulsory education for townies about what happens in the country ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’d be really good for town and country folk , when they ’re at school , to learn more about each other			2
there ’d be a low - level exam			0
if you fail twice , you ’re not allowed to vote			0
unless you understand the issues , you ’re not qualified			0
’ mr @entity11 , who lives in a sprawling mansion in @entity33 , also attacked politicians who are ‘ allergic to grass ’ , saying they make unpopular decisions about countryside matters			1
the 56 - year - old said : ‘ the rural economy has kept many employed , happy and healthy for a long time			2
' i live in the country and find it irritating when issues that affect it are decided by city dwellers , many of whom love tarmac , are allergic to grass and find it hard to understand where @entity52 dancing comes from			1
’ the cricketer lives in @entity55 , @entity56 , with his @entity58 wife @entity57 and two daughters , @entity60 , 19 and @entity61 , 17			2

mr @entity11 , who lives in a sprawling mansion in @entity33 , also attacked politicians who are ' allergic to grass ' mr @entity11 , irreverently nicknamed @entity74 because of his aristocratic ancestry and public school education , said : ‘ i ’d permit fox hunting and encourage tolerance of other country pursuits			1
i ’ve no desire to hunt foxes , but i do n’t want to stop others			0
i shoot , and i have interesting discussions with people about firing at defenceless pheasants			0
‘ i do worry about a time when townies decide to arm pheasants and they start shooting back			1
‘ but land that ’s devoted to shooting is well tended , with cover crops and woods			2
the landowners i know are responsible people who want to preserve their estates for future generations			0
and the shooting community is very clear that everything that ’s shot should be eaten			2
‘ many of these issues apply to fox hunting – conservation and also pest control			1
i ’d ask city - dwellers what they think when confronted by urban foxes , which have proliferated			0
