' ' i had a headache , but not the migraine type , i felt sick and generally sluggish and it almost felt like i was still a bit drunk from the night before			2
i would also feel quite un-coordinated and off balance , ' she told @entity89			2
' even before i woke up properly in the mornings i would reach across and take some tablets			0
' the doctor said it looked like i was having migraines and i just took tablets , but i was having to take them every day in the end			2
' but as soon as i had the ct scan after i went to hospital all of a sudden all hell broke loose			0
' the doctor said to me " you 've had a bleed on the brain " and i could n't believe it			2
' the operation to remove the mass was so scary - i did n't know if i was going to come out of the operation , and if i did , how much damage was going to be done			2
' scars : surgeons peeled back ms @entity1 scalp before cutting a 5cm square in her skull to remove the tangled mass of arteries and veins which had developed there then burst - causing her agonising pain in a risky , eight - hour operation , surgeons painstakingly peeled back ms @entity1 scalp and cut a 5cm square in her skull to remove the mass. but that was n't the end of her ordeal			1

' i 'm much better now , but i have to take longer words quite slowly			0
' i feel very lucky			0
normally when you have a bleed on the brain it causes lots of damage , but i was mostly fine			0
