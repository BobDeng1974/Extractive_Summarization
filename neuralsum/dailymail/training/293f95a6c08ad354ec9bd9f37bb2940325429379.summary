the first day of @entity1 's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of cantankerous former emcee @entity3 after an eight - year absence , along with two completely new co-hosts who will no - doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet			1
appearing for the first time on the panel was token blonde @entity10 , who conservative credentials beat even @entity12 - loving @entity13 since @entity14 actually worked for @entity12 and in the third corner , the wildcard : known for her voice as much as for her no - holds - barred @entity19 attitude -- actress @entity21			1
the first day of @entity1 's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight - year absence , along with two completely new co-hosts who will no - doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet two @entity36 ! @entity3 is back after a contentious exit and several years absence and she 's brought another @entity21 with her -- actress and activist @entity21 @entity40 gave her blessing : the queen herself made an appearance in a pre-taped segment as the ladies of her show held court and each kissed her hand but do n't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat ( here 's looking at you @entity55 ) : @entity3 says the new view will be smarter , calmer and an all - around better show			1
the live show began calmly , with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen @entity61 , who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses , including the only one remaining from the previous season , @entity67			1
' welcome to the newer view , ' joked @entity67 , before introducing @entity3			1
@entity3 kicked things off by catching up with viewers , including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed			2
up next , an introduction of the other @entity21 -- actress @entity21 , who plugged her upcoming @entity76 show and memoir			1
then came @entity10 : former @entity12 press secretary for six years			1
' i am a @entity79 , i should get that out of the way , ' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle			2
before things got too out of control , fiery liberal @entity3 piped in : ' and i like her , i swear ! ' true to form , though , the group jumped right into a contentious topic -- the @entity91 domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse			1
' all about money , all about the brand being jeopardized , ' politico @entity14 chimed in first on the @entity91 issue			0
@entity99 agreed there 's no excuse for hitting women , used her sports hero , convicted abuser @entity105 , to make the point that one 's environment could be at fault as much as the individual			0
' [ @entity111 ] respond the way you were taught , ' said the actress			0
but should one continue to support the likes of @entity105 and @entity91 by paying for event tickets ? @entity3 did n't think so			2
' i have n't seen a @entity119 movie since the allegations came out , ' @entity3 said , moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse			2
though she did say she continues to appreciate @entity124 as an artist , despite his violent past			0
values clash ? @entity67 is back , of course , but a woman with decidedly different politics from hers is on this year , too			1
not just a mom - first , mouthy conservative like former host @entity13 , new token blonde conservative @entity10 actually worked @entity12 's @entity134 pulling her weight : all the ladies on the panel were fascinated as former @entity12 staffer turned @entity140 wrangler recalled her days in the controversial @entity134 and ill - fated @entity142 campaign trail @entity99 and @entity3 introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together , a play on their identical names called @entity3 or @entity3 ? in the game , the audience members tries to win a prize by deciding which @entity21 does the thing being described on a card			1
in one of the inaugural game 's questions , @entity3 asked which of the @entity159 practices tae kwon do			1
' @entity3 ! ' replied the contestant			2
' wrong , ' @entity3 belowed to the young lady 's chagrin			1
with two comedians and a funny lady actress on the panel , the group also addressed the recent tragic deaths of @entity168 and @entity169			2
' i 've been at that place , ' @entity3 said , empathizing with her depression - plagued late friend @entity168			2
@entity3 suggested that , for the depressed , leaving grieving children behind is n't enough to stop someone bent on suicide			0
@entity176 : a new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel -- for instance : @entity14 hates @entity182 , @entity3 has a gastric bypass , @entity99 has a forthcoming memoir , and @entity67 , well , she 's been enjoying her shoes another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called @entity3 or @entity3 ? where contestants must decide which @entity21 is being described on a card loss but a win : while this episode 's contestant lost @entity3 or @entity3 ? with only one correct answer , the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about @entity99 -- she practices tae kwon do ! when the topic had turned to politics , all eyes turned to @entity14			1
' @entity182 and i were not good friends , ' she said as the group touched on the @entity206 ' recent trip to @entity207			0
she 's definitely running 100 percent , though , said the @entity209 insider			0
while @entity182 is today 's hot topic , the group was more interested by far to hear @entity14 's stories about her days as @entity140 's wrangler during the the @entity142 campaign			0
@entity14 kept her cool but did reveal that @entity140 blamed her completely for the vp candidate 's infamous interview with @entity217 and said the candidate and aide 's relationship was irreparably damaged that day in 2008			0
she also gave a comic rendition of the day she learned vice president @entity222 had shot a man during @entity12 's already unpopular second term that left the ladies in stitches			1
the show concluded with a tribute to rivers that began with a song in the comedienne 's honor by @entity76 diva @entity233			0
a best - of montage of some of @entity229 ' over 30 appearances then followed , to much applause and teary eyes			0
' she gave and gave and gave , ' @entity99 said as @entity3 joked about the snarky comments @entity229 made to her regarding her unconventionally feminine persona			0
' loved it , ' she said			0
big fans of @entity244 : the show concluded with a tearful tribute to a dear friend of @entity1 , the recently passed @entity169 , who appeared on the show over 30 times tribute : guest @entity233 gave a beautiful tribute to @entity169 through song to help close out the show			0

@entity3 is back and promises a lot more smart talk and a lot less *squabbling* ( and no mentions of the earth being flat )
the controversial comedian had some complaints of recent sciatica
another @entity21 's on , too -- wise - *cracking* actress @entity21
the token @entity79 blonde has far better conservative credentials than former host @entity13 -- @entity10 actually worked for @entity12
@entity67 's back as the head - screwed - on tight *moderator* and all four ladies bowed to the queen at the start of the show
