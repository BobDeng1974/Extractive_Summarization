from the little we know about @entity2 , he seems to be an individual who does n’t want to pile too much pressure on himself			1
‘ i hope to score at least one goal and be better than @entity6 ! ’ he grinned this week			2
there may have a been just a hint of humour attributed to that - his @entity12 counterpart was a key component in the £ 9million move to @entity16 - but @entity2 looks set to leave the @entity18 flop behind and become a @entity20 hit			1
that ’s if his full @entity23 debut at @entity24 on saturday is anything to go by			1
@entity2 holds his head in his hands after being booked for diving against @entity24 the @entity23 ' record signing can consider himself unlucky to have been denied what seemed like a penalty @entity33 was lucky to avoid a red card and a penalty after he slid in against @entity2 but missed the ball click here to read @entity39 's match report from @entity16 's @entity40 win against @entity24 at @entity41			1
playing in behind @entity42 , @entity2 was a bundle of energy and willing runner for a team who have so often lacked genuine options going forward away from home this season			1
@entity51 will know he has a man who could be the key to survival this season - that added touch of invention and glimmer on the ball to open up gaps and allow @entity16 ’s wide players - @entity62 and @entity63 in this case - to find their way in behind			1
the 23 - year - old was the main outlet for @entity51 here at @entity41 , and that bodes well for the immediate future			2
having scored 28 goals already this season , more ought to follow			0
@entity2 is used to playing in front of barely 4,000 supporters for @entity75 in @entity12 , but does n’t appear fazed by the daunting prospect of @entity78 football that @entity80 and countless others struggled with			2
it ’s @entity82 at @entity83 up next			0
and he ’s already been given a taste of what flair players at the top of the domestic game can expect ; unfortunately , this experience was n’t one he will have dreamt of back home			0
@entity2 dribbles down the wing while trying to evade the challenge of goalscorer @entity94 the @entity96 striker goes in for a 50 - 50 challenge with @entity99 midfielder @entity98 at @entity41 @entity98 tracks @entity101 's record signing during the second half in north @entity103 with @entity16 a goal down , @entity2 scampered beyond the square - footed @entity105 and bore down on @entity33 after @entity106 ’s through ball			1
one - on - one , these are the situations he was bought for			0
one touch and off he went past the goalkeeper , ready to tap into an unguarded net			0
that would ’ve been the only logical end to the move , but @entity33 tripped him before the youngster had chance to equalise			0
on first viewing it was a clear penalty , but referee @entity119 marched up to the attacker , signalled a dive and brandished a yellow card			0
welcome to our world , @entity125 , where officials are so petrified of being indecisive that everything is black and white			0
@entity2 did not dive - it was not a booking			2
the trick for him now is to shrug the episode off			0
he might have had that first goal for the club but , when stealing a yard in front of @entity136 , met @entity33 in inspired form - the @entity138 somehow managing to tip wide when @entity2 lashed at goal from eight yards			2
the signs for why @entity141 fancied @entity2 at @entity142 are there for all to see			1
he must just hope that @entity119 does n’t follow him in the weeks to come			0
@entity16 scored twice in the final 10 minutes to come from behind and dump @entity24 out of the @entity40 @entity24 took the lead after @entity94 sent @entity145 the wrong way from the penalty spot @entity62 celebrates after scoring the winning goal in added time in north @entity103			1

@entity2 made his @entity40 debut in the win at @entity24
the @entity96 was *harshly* booked for diving after being *fouled* in the *box*
but @entity2 showed why @entity142 were *interested* in him
@entity16 came from behind to win at @entity41
