at the start of the year @entity12 , from @entity13 , knew that her lifestyle was far from healthy			1
' i got tired easily			1
my legs would burn half way up the stairs			1
i ’d get breathless and if i was late and had to run for the bus i ’d feel like my lungs were going to explode , ' she said			1
but it was n't until she found she could n't fit into an airplane seat in february that she decided enough was enough			1
the 32 - year - old said : ' it was the worst moment of my life			1
i got on a plane to @entity28 for work and i had to ask for a seatbelt extension			1
' i have struggled with my weight my whole life but there and then , i just thought , that ’s it			1
' she signed up to a weight loss programme that provided low calorie foods and drinks as well as group counselling sessions to address the reasons behind excessive eating			1
she said : ' people perceived me as happy and that nothing bothered me because i suppressed my feelings by eating			2
being big my whole life , i was constantly being put down , even if people did n’t mean to			2
sometimes i ’d feel embarrassed going to a restaurant and ordering			1
' the counselling really helps you to deal with everything			1
i did n’t have any significant health problems			2
but i knew if i was to continue the way i was , i ’d have one foot in the grave			2
' mrs @entity12 has battled with her weight since she was in her early teens , tipping the scales at close to 15 stone when she was just 14			1
she believes her overeating started shortly after her grandfather was knocked down and killed by a car when she was 13			2
before she started the @entity63 programme @entity64 , an assistant manager of a lingerie shop , would skip breakfast and be so hungry by lunch time that she would gorge herself on fast food			1
she would snack on chocolates and sweets throughout the day and not eat another meal until she got home at 8pm when she would tuck into a huge plate of lasagne or pasta			2
now she follows a health eating routine and goes to the gym three times a week			2
she also enjoys swimming and cycling			2

' bounce in her step : @entity1 is now training for a half marathon as the weight dropped off , mrs @entity12 - who was engaged at the time - had to have her wedding dress taken in several times			1

she said : ' some people who i had n’t seen in a while were shocked			0
they came up to me afterwards and said if they saw me in the shop they would n’t have known it was me			0
i ’m glad i did it			0
it made the whole experience better			0
' the newly wed added : ' i ’m still getting used to my new look			0
i will walk past a mirror at work and have to take a minute			0
my arms look really small			0
' but i love it and my husband is happy as long as i ’m happy			0
he loves me if i ’m 23 [ stone ] and he loves me if i ’m 12 ( stone )			0
he can now wrap his arms around me			0
before he could only get them half way			0
' mrs @entity12 , who is originally from @entity122 , said losing the weight meant she had a fantastic time on her honeymoon with new husband @entity84 in @entity126			1
she said : ' i was able to go paragliding			0
we also went walking along the beach and sunbathing , which i would n’t have done before because i would be conscious about how the swim suit fitted			0
' it ’s made a big difference			0
i feel like i have found who i am			1
i think the real me was buried between the layers of insulation			0
' mrs @entity12 is now gearing up to take part in next year ’s @entity138 - having been told she would never run again as her weight was stopping torn ligaments in her ankle from healing			1
