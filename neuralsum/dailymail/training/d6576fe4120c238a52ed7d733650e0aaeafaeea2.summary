@entity0 will be able to swap their cassocks for jeans , t - shirts and even shellsuits at services , weddings and funerals after the @entity7 approved the radical ‘ makeover ’ last night			1
rules requiring clergy to don traditional vestments were swept aside by a vote at the @entity13 , the @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity14 ’ , as part of efforts to make services more relevant to modern congregations			1
the @entity7 will now draw up rules to permit clergy to wear what they deem appropriate for services , as long as they have the permission of their bishop			2
from this to that ? rector reverend @entity29 is pictured left after a service at @entity31 in 2008			0
right shows a picture of a ' @entity33 ' after a @entity35 wedding			0
stock image some vicars have already indicated they will adopt a ‘ dress - down ’ approach , which critics say opens up the prospect of seeing shellsuits in the pulpit			1
the @entity13 , meeting in @entity45 , passed the proposals after @entity48 vicar @entity47 said : ‘ there are some contexts where robes should be worn , and some contexts where robes may not help in conveying the things we want them to convey			0
’ today the archbishop of @entity57 warned against becoming ' too hysterical ' over @entity59 radicalisation in @entity60 as he spoke of his concerns about developing a ' culture of fear ' towards @entity63			1
the @entity65 @entity64 said there was a problem with radicalisation of @entity63 in @entity60 and an ' issue ' with young men travelling to @entity71 and returning to the @entity60 ' highly radicalised '			1
but , speaking in an interview on @entity74 's the @entity73 , the @entity56 said the proportion of @entity63 in @entity60 who are radicalised remained ' extraordinarily small '			1
he said there was a danger of a ' national culture of fear ' over the issue			0
' clearly there is an issue with people going to @entity71 and coming back highly radicalised			0
there is a problem with radicalisation , ' he said			2
' but the proportion of @entity63 who are radicalised is extraordinarily small and i 'm just edgy about developing a national culture of fear because i do n't think that gets us anywhere and i think we 're in danger of slipping into a very fearful culture in which we see everyone against us and us against everyone and we 're constantly trying to defend ourselves			1
' hysteria : speaking in an interview on @entity74 's the @entity73 , the archbishop of @entity57 , right , said the proportion of @entity63 in @entity60 who are radicalised remained ' extraordinarily small ' the decision to relax the dress code for vicars came as the @entity13 prepared to debate the adoption of a ' shorter , clearer ' liturgy for use at baptism services			1
members of the @entity13 meeting in @entity45 will discuss a proposed new service which removes references to rejecting the @entity111			0
instead it will require parents and god parents to say that they ' turn away from sin ' and ' reject evil '			0
the changes are designed to help people attending the services who may not have any previous connection to the @entity7			2
a report for the @entity7 's @entity123 said : ' @entity124 frequently find themselves conducting baptisms for " un-churched " families , sometimes at services separate from the main sunday morning act of worship			2
' on these occasions there may be a few people present who have a developed understanding of the @entity7 's language and symbolism			0
' for the majority of those attending , the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible			0

some vicars have already indicated they will ' dress down ' for services
but critics claim it will lead to prospect of shellsuits at the pulpit
decision came *ahead* of debate on new liturgy for baptism services
today @entity64 warns against ' hysteria ' over @entity59 radicalisation
archbishop says number of *extremists* is ' extraordinarily small '
