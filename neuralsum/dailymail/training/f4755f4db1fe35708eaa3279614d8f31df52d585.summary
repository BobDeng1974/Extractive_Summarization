standing in the sunshine , chatting with my friends in the park on a lovely saturday morning , i could not have been more content			0
then i caught a glimpse of garish pink and @entity7 yellow			0
in an instant , my mood was shattered as a voice gasped : ' @entity11 , @entity12			0
is that your husband ? ' and there he was , walking towards us in an outfit even @entity18 would struggle to pull off			1
in fact waddling would be a more apt description , as his cycling shoes made walking all but impossible			1
for my darling husband is a @entity33 , and had just returned from his ritual saturday bike ride			1
' what is a @entity33 ? ' i hear you cry			0
well , as of last week you need look no further than the @entity38 to find out			0
it stands for a @entity40			0
the definition is ' a middle - aged man who is a very keen road cyclist , typically one who rides an expensive bike and wears the type of clothing associated with professional cyclists '			1
crisis : @entity26 's mid-life crisis is entirely his choice , says @entity12 who says it has turned her into a weekend widow rapidly turning grey as she watches money drain from their joint account you will have seen them			1
their numbers are swelling at an alarming rate , thanks to @entity64 winners sir @entity65 and @entity66 — men i would admire but for my husband 's desire to emulate them			1
as professional sportsmen , it is their job to dress in ridiculous clothes and spend endless hours in the saddle			1
but @entity26 's mid-life crisis is entirely his choice , and has turned me into a weekend widow rapidly turning grey as i watch money drain from our joint account more quickly than a @entity82 sprint			1
for those fortunate enough to have normal husbands , allow me to elaborate			0
being a @entity33 is about much more than squeezing your ample frame into tight lycra			0
@entity33 hero : the men all want to be like @entity64 winner @entity65 this means boring dinner parties into silence with endless chat about bikes , spending long hours of family time out ' training ' , embarrassing your children walking around the house in bib shorts ( think a mankini with padding around the nether regions ) and paying eye - watering sums for obscure items of kit			1
@entity26 's transformation into a @entity33 began five years ago when , to get fit , he bought a road bike			1
at first , he wore a sensible pair of shorts and a loose - fitting jersey			0
but then the buying began in earnest			1
new wheels ( the old ones were slowing him down , apparently ) , a pair of cycling shoes , then another pair , then a ' quicker ' helmet , then a personal trainer to help him shed the pounds and improve his ' power to weight ratio '			1
transformation : @entity26 's evolution into a @entity33 began five years ago when , to get fit , he bought a road bike the clothes grew tighter , the cost escalated as he bought a cycling computer ( a glorified satnav ) , which at £ 500 cost almost as much as his bike , and £ 250 sunglasses ( they have gaps in the lenses to stop them steaming up — but if you sweat as much as @entity26 , they steam up anyway )			1
now our weekends have been taken over by cycling			1
for @entity139 do not simply go on an hour - long run out			0
rides regularly last three hours or more , while in the spring and summer they disappear for days to ride in ' sportive ' events			1
my husband , like so many of his friends , is a fanatic			1
he buys an average of one bike a year , each more expensive than the last			2
his first was a relatively meagre £ 800 , that he sold two years on for £ 200			2
emulating their idols : @entity12 's husband and his friends go on cycling trips abroad so they can cycle routes taken by professionals like @entity66 , pictured right today , he has three : a day - to - day ' workhorse ' ( £ 1,000 ) , a steel ' winter trainer ' ( £ 850 ) and a custom - built , red , white and blue road bike ( £ 2,000 — his name is painted on the frame )			1
then there are the clothes , gadgets and ' sports nutrition '			2
tools , inner tubes , tyres , wheels , hats , gloves ( summer , autumn , winter and spring versions ) , shoes ( waterproof for the winter , lightweight for the summer ) , overshoes , arm warmers , leg warmers , lights , pumps , pedals and saddles ... the list is endless			0
every week another mysterious package arrives , with the latest waterproof jersey or a vintage cycling cap of a type once worn by one of his increasingly obscure heroes			2
spending : @entity12 says every week another mysterious package arrives , with the latest waterproof jersey or a vintage cycling cap of a type once worn by one of his increasingly obscure heroes at night in bed , he reads @entity196 or autobiographies of surly - looking @entity198			2
he has also been agonising over whether to shave his legs or not , although the only reason he can give me for doing so is ' the pros do it '			0
even when it rains we get no respite			0
rather than miss a ride he sets up rollers ( a treadmill for bikes ) in the kitchen and scares the dog witless by riding on the spot for a noisy hour			2
then there are the foreign trips			0
we live in the @entity216 — one of the best cycling spots in the country			2
@entity220 , where the @entity222 road race was held , is a local climb and the @entity224 passes through every year			2
all the gear , no idea : @entity12 's husband as much kit as @entity82 but cycling is not his career the one thing we do n't have is a mountain			1
so a couple of times a year @entity26 and his @entity33 pals pack their bikes into protective boxes ( £ 500 ) and fly to the @entity238 or the @entity239 , for a weekend emulating their professional cycling idols			1
it may drive me to distraction , but i must admit i admire his dedication			0
our son , @entity246 , six , certainly looks up to him and wants a road bike , too			1
even @entity248 , eight - going - on - 18 , was genuinely interested in racing a bike until recently , when she started to prefer my @entity250 and dance classes			2
for a man diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ten years ago , @entity26 is impressively active both ride well and have picked up a love of exercise from @entity26 and me			1
for a man diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ten years ago , @entity26 is impressively active			1
within a year of taking up cycling he rode from @entity260 to @entity261 and this summer did the @entity262 — a mountain stage of the @entity64 , in appalling weather			2
as mid-life crises go it could be a lot worse			0
i am far happier my 41 - year - old husband is out riding a pushbike with a bunch of other men than zooming around on a @entity273 and chasing girls half his age			2
i also take comfort from the fact i am not alone			0
in our circle of friends , six of the husbands have taken up cycling			2
they are putting this passion to good use , too			0
next may they will take part in a charity cycle ride from @entity288 to @entity289 in aid of @entity291 , a local cancer charity			0
being a @entity33 , like all mid-life crises means acting like little boys			0
as 11 - year - olds do , they have their in - jokes , asserting the perfect number of bikes to own is n + 1 ( @entity299 is the number of bikes you have already )			0
another formula , which shows they are not entirely stupid , is s – 1 ( @entity305 is the number of bikes that will prompt your wife to demand a separation )			0
in @entity26 's case , he seems to have taken heed to the latter — he used to have two more than now ( a mountain bike and a @entity314 folding cycle )			1
of course , he hankers for more			0
recently , he has been wittering on about carbon and titanium frames , in the hope of boring me into submission			0
i humour him up to a point , but on one issue i will not budge			0
since that day in the park @entity26 is banned from attending any social occasion dressed in lycra — on pain of his bike being sent to the tip. would i really follow through with the threat ? just try me .			1

@entity25 from @entity330 is a cycling widow
her husband @entity26 's transformation began five years ago
to get fit , he bought a road bike but soon became *obsessed*
now he spends hours in the saddle
he has also spent a fortune on bikes , cycling clothing and gadgets
