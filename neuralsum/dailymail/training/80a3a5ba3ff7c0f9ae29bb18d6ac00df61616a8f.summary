by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 12 august 2013 ad men and social media gurus have been scratching their heads trying to work out why some videos and advertising campaigns go viral on @entity6			1
but now the social network has confirmed what many might have feared - that there is ' no single magic formula ' for widespread success			2
@entity6 examined three big viral video hits - actor @entity12 ' refusing ' to eat cereal , astronaut @entity15 singing @entity16 and @entity18 's real beauty marketing campaign			1
according to @entity6 , more than 90 percent of shares took place in the first three days after mr @entity15 posted it , demonstrating that it is possible to have a real word - of - mouth hit @entity6 @entity29 's @entity28 wrote in a blogpost : ' one of the key things we learned from looking closely at these three is that videos do n’t go viral in the same way			1
' there are no rules to “ virality ” — while some ignite , and spread like wildfire across the web , the growth of others is much more measured , like ripples spreading across a lake			1
' @entity6 produced ' dynamic visualisation ' videos to show how the videos went viral , using different coloured dots to show how they spread on the social network			1
he said : ' the blue nodes represent @entity53 ; the bigger they are , the larger the potential reach of that tweet			0
' the yellow dots represent retweets			0
in each case , reach takes into account not just followers , but also audience size and amplification by retweet			0
' singing astronaut commander @entity15 sang @entity20 's @entity16 aboard the @entity21 and his rendition spread around the globe			1
according to @entity6 , more than 90 per cent of shares took place in the first three days after mr @entity15 posted it , demonstrating that it is possible to have a real viral hit by word - of - mouth			2
the link mentions peaked fast and were driven by ' global influencers ' but the videowas first shared by mr @entity15 himself , demonstrating the sustained growth was driven by one man 's efforts			0
it is thought the song proved so appealing because of its unique origin and was therefore far more popular than videos filmed on @entity85			0
the creators of the ' @entity12 wo n't eat his cereal ' video was seeded with only a small handful of top vine influencers to go global			2
it was made using video clip tool @entity92 , collecting a series of six second clips of the actor being offered - and refusing - cereal in a dramatic way			0
the videos were then seeded with key influencers within the @entity92 community to ensure the videos went viral and spread in a similar manner to a breaking news story			0
however , of more interest to marketing agencies looking to create the next big viral hit , @entity18 's @entity106 beauty campaign spread quite differently among clusters of local communities to enjoy a longer shelf life			1
mr @entity28 said it was driven by ' a long tail of link - sharing and by positive audience sentiment '			0
interestingly the @entity6 video shows there were less spikes caused by influencers mentioning the campaign , which instead spread in clusters of communities , demonstrating the value of local engagement			2
mr @entity28 's blog post seems designed to promote @entity6 's benefits to brands at a time when the social network is under fire for allowing trolling and threats to female users , among others			1
some users are boycotting @entity6 in protest , while @entity6 has promised to simplify its abuse reporting process , make its rules more straightforward and promote responsible use of the network			0
@entity6 is keen to show the community of over 200 million people is still a place where brands should be interested in spreading their messages and has recommended that companies hoping to have a big viral hit should use hashtags , use @entity92 and pay for promoted tweets and trend adverts .			2
